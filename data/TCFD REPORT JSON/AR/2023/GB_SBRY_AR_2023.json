Reference to 'the Bank' means Sainsbury's Bank plc and reference to 'the Group' specifies the Bank and its subsidiaries. Further information on investment in group undertakings can be found in note 23.\n\nThe Bank is a wholly owned subsidiary of J Sainsbury plc,  however,  it  is governed by its own Board and Executive Committee, independent from J Sainsbury plc (see Risk Overview and Governance sections on pages 29 and 36). These Group results are included in the consolidated J Sainsbury plc ('the Sainsbury's Group') financial statements which are publicly available.\n\nThe Bank is a public company limited by shares, incorporated and registered in England, and domiciled in the United Kingdom. Its registered office is 33 Holborn, London, EC1N 2HT. Our principal place of business is 3 Lochside Avenue, Edinburgh, EH12 9DJ.\n\n## Strategic update\n\nOn the 18 January 2024 the Sainsbury's Group announced a strategy update, where the financial services products offered in the future will be provided by dedicated financial services providers through a distributed model.\n\nOver time, this means we will have a phased withdrawal from our core Banking business, with all our financial services products being provided by third parties.\n\nThe Group is currently developing plans aligned to this strategic intent and revised future operating model.  We will continue to support colleagues, customers and our existing products through this transitional phase.\n\nWe continue to prepare our accounts on a going concern basis, after due consideration of the risks resulting from this strategy change.  More detail on this assessment is provided on page 41.\n\n## Current business model\n\nThroughout the financial year 2023/24, we continued to drive value for the Sainsbury's Group by striving to be an agile, capital and costefficient provider of simple, mobile led financial services for Sainsbury's and Argos customers.\n\nWe offer a range of retail banking services and related financial services wholly within the UK.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Banking products:\n\n- \u00b7 Funds are raised through savings deposits and wholesale sources. We use these sources of funding to lend to customers or hold them as liquid assets.\n- \u00b7 Our savings and lending products are sold and serviced online or by telephone.\n- \u00b7 Our Mortgages business was sold to the Co-Operative Bank in August 2023 - see page 5 for details.\n\n## Commission products:\n\n- \u00b7 Insurance products are offered to customers where we act as a broker to a number of underwriters on Car and Home and as an Introducer to several insurers across Pet, Life and Travel. All products are available online or via telephone.\n- \u00b7 Travel Money services are available to customers at our Bureaux counters in Sainsbury's supermarkets and online.  Foreign currency is acquired wholesale and sold to customers at a retail rate with margin. We also earn fees on prepaid cards and money transfer services.\n- \u00b7 Our ATMs provide easy and free access to cash with machines, predominately within Sainsbury's and Argos stores.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Strategic report\n\n## Year in review\n\n## Always offering value and making it easy for our customers\n\nEver more so with on-going cost of living pressures, customers seek the best deals with brands they can trust. Throughout the year, we have sought to be the natural choice for Sainsbury's shoppers with seamless, straightforward financial products. Supported by our brand and aligned to our consumer duty commitments, we are focused on delivering value while being a trusted ally to our customers.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn Argos Financial Services (AFS), we have seen fantastic levels of connectivity with Argos throughout the year, for example with the launch of our 'Pay No Interest' campaign to coincide with the Argos 50th birthday celebrations.\n\nOur Net Promoter Score (NPS) for Sainsbury's Bank and Argos Financial Services brands remains strong, supported by continued developments of customer online journeys. Argos Financial Services is up 2.5 points while Sainsbury's Bank is up 2 points from Q4 last year .\n\n## Stepping up in Digital for our Customers\n\nWith customers at the heart of our digital designs, we have continually enhanced, tested and optimised each step of their product journeys with us, resulting in a 13% increase for the Bank's customer satisfaction score on last year.\n\nIn Credit Cards , our mobile app has seen numerous improvements in functionality throughout the year. These enhancements include View PIN, dynamic minimum payments, balance transfers and Pay by Bank. Pay By Bank gives our customers more payment options, with around half of all app payments being made using this method.\n\nIn Loans our streamlined application process has seen higher levels of customers complete the journey they begin, and the new digital top-up functionality gives our customers a new channel of choice, with 87% of loan top ups now done online.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn Insurances ,  Pet  have  made  improvements  in  both  self-service  and  the  digital  claims  journey, including easier navigation of policy information at claim stage. Within Car and Home, digital customer journeys have been improved to make it clearer to customers which product and optional extras are right for them. Travel Insurance customers are now able to check documents, make changes and renew policies  online.  Life  insurance  also  launched  on  Compare  the  Market, increasing our visibility.\n\nTravel Money made usability and customer experience improvements within the mobile app, which helped us see an extra 37,000 transactions from customers 'loading' their cards with currency than the previous year. Our mobile app has a strong rating of 4.6 and 4.2 stars on the Apple App and Google Play stores respectively at February 2024 (out of 5 stars).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Connectivity\n\nOur total number of customers in Sainsbury's Bank decreased slightly, from 1.9 million at February 2023 to 1.8 million at February 2024. This was driven by Credit Cards, where we significantly reduced Balance Transfers in light of market pricing relative to increased funding costs; but partially offset by Loans and Insurance customer increases. Customer numbers in Argos Financial Services have reduced from 2.1 million to 2.0 million at February 2024 due to the tightening of credit policy, reducing the number of new accounts being accepted.\n\nNectar continued to be an integral part of our strategy to connect with Sainsbury's customers, with 81% of our customers holding a Nectar card and benefiting from Nectar points and rewards across a range of products. We are communicating more with our customers through nectar channels, which delivers 37% of our non-digital direct sales.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe  continued  to  support  the  growth  of  our  Sainsbury's  core  food  business  and  general merchandising, funding over \u00a31.7bn of retail spend on our Credit Cards, Store Cards and Monthly Payment Plan products across Sainsbury's, Argos and Habitat.",

        "page_content": "## Strategic report\n\n## Sale of the mortgage business\n\nThe  mortgage  portfolio was sold to The Co-operative Bank Plc  on 15 August 2023, reflecting the earlier strategic decision to exit mortgages to simplify the business. This reduced customer lending by \u00a3449m on sale.  Although the risks and rewards of the business have transferred, we continue to service mortgages customers until legal transfer takes place, expected in summer 2024.\n\nFollowing this, the Group has reclassified the mortgage business as a discontinued operation in the current year in accordance with the requirements of IFRS 5 'Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations.' The consolidated income statement has been restated accordingly to show only the Continuing Operations of the Group, with profit after tax from discontinued operations presented as a single line at the foot of the statement. Interest expense of \u00a39m (2023: \u00a313m) in respect of the cost of funding the mortgage business is presented within net interest income from continuing operations, as it cannot be attributed to liabilities entered into specifically to fund the mortgage business.  All notes to the financial statements supporting the consolidated income statement have also been restated, with prior year restatements explained in Note 3. The Group has disclosed an income statement, statement of cash flows and the net loss on disposal relating to this transaction in Note 14, where we also present management views of the profitability of the business inclusive of funding costs and an allocation of overhead costs.\n\n## Banking business\n\nWe launched our 'Everyday Credit Card', which has increased our customer eligibility for a Sainsbury's credit card. Loans personal pricing was launched in July 2023, providing our customers with an early indication of their likelihood of acceptance and interest rate. In June, we won Moneyfacts Best Personal Loan Provider for the second year in a row and were commended for Best Card Provider.\n\nIn Savings, we launched a partnership with Hargreaves Lansdown, meaning we can serve more customers in a new channel with more propositions.\n\nIn Argos Financial Services Store Cards, our 'pay no interest' offering has supported an increase in credit sales of 5% from last year, as well as providing incremental sales for Argos.\n\nWith our announced future move to a distributed model, we have withdrawn our Monthly Payment Plan from Argos Financial Services.\n\nWe made some targeted investments in existing fraud systems as well as expanding our use of remote document verification and behavioural biometrics on personal Loans and Credit Cards.  This resulted in improved fraud resilience across all our unsecured credit products, with a 44% year-on-year reduction in fraud losses across the Group.\n\n## Commission business\n\nOur Insurance strategy is to be the insurance provider of choice for Sainsbury's shoppers. We want to be the provider of products of great value for Sainsbury's Nectar card holders, through discounts and intelligent pricing, with the quality-of-service Sainsbury's is known for. Our switch and save campaign helped to contribute towards new business within Pet which is up 10% from last year. Home has also seen a strong year of new business growth, up 30% from last year. We launched our 'Essentials' product within Car in June 2023, offering our customers more choice at a price point which is right for them.\n\nOur Travel Money product had a brilliant year, when looking at our NPS score which is up 29 points from Q4 last year. Sainsbury's customers loved our launch of Nectar prices, with over 1 million transactions on Nectar rates since launch helping drive total currency transactions for the year up 27% from last year. Our customers ordering online are also now able to collect Euros and US Dollars at their local instore bureau from as little as four hours after ordering.\n\nOur ATM estate supports the access to cash initiative, legislation put in place by the government to ensure financial inclusion across the UK. We installed 12 ATMs in areas identified as needing access to cash following recent closures of other ATMs. These machines are not in Sainsbury's or Argos stores.  We are proud to say that \u00a31 in every \u00a39 withdrawn through the ATM LINK network in the UK is from a Sainsbury's Bank machine, highlighting how important our ATMs are to customers.\n\n## Consumer Duty\n\nDelivering good customer outcomes has always been our focus, this is core to our brand and culture. New Consumer Duty regulations came into force in July 2023, providing us with an opportunity to reassess our delivery of good customer outcomes, while making sure that we are compliant. Our customers have had external pressures from rising costs, driven primarily through higher inflation, higher interest rates and the price of energy, meaning it's more important than ever that we continue to support them. Whilst we have not identified any significant risks for customers receiving poor outcomes, we have taken action to make improvements.\n\nOur new strategy will provide better choices, functionality and, ultimately, improve outcomes for customers in the medium to longer term. The risks and impacts of this change will be carefully managed during any transition.\n\nSainsbury's Bank plc Annual Report and Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 29 February 2024",

Information demonstrating how we applied the principles can be found throughout the Strategic Report as outlined below:\n\n| Principle 1 - Purpose and Leadership    | See  our  business  model  (page  3)  and  strategy  (page  3)  sections of the Strategic Report.   |\n|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Principle 2 - Board Composition         | Outlined  in  the  directors'  report  on  page  40  and  the  Strategic Report on page 37.         |\n| Principle 3 - Director Responsibilities | See the Strategic Report on page 37.                                                                |\n| Principle 4 - Opportunity and Risk      | See the Strategic Report on page 38.                                                                |\n| Principle 5 - Remuneration              | See the Strategic Report on page 38.                                                                |\n| Principle 6 - Stakeholder Relationships | Our  engagement  with  stakeholders  is  outlined  in  the                                          |\n| and Engagement                          | Section 172 statement opposite.                                                                     |\n\n## Section 172\n\nThe Board fully recognises its obligations under the Companies Act 2006, including those set out in section 172. Its governance framework and regular programme of agenda items ensures it has due regard to:\n\n- \u00b7 The likely longer-term consequences of its decisions. The Board has historically approved a rolling five-year strategic plan on an annual basis, regularly monitoring progress through key metrics (which form the basis of KPIs outlined on pages 24 to 26) and sub-committees to provide appropriate review, balanced challenge and transparency on decision making. Given the recent strategic  change,  the  Board  will  continue  to  consider  the  medium  and  longer-term consequences of any decisions and will develop appropriate KPIs as the strategy develops.\n- \u00b7 Maintaining the reputation of the Bank (and the Sainsbury's Group brands it uses) for high standards of business conduct. The Board promotes the values of the wider Sainsbury's Group across the organisation. These values help colleagues to know how to act at work and we believe they are right because they are also the way that many of us live outside of work too. The Sainsbury's Group (including the Bank and its subsidiaries) has always had a strong sense of social, environmental and economic responsibility  and an understanding that our success depends on society's success. Further details on our approach to diversity, environmental and social factors are outlined in the Non-Financial reporting section on pages 7 to 21.\n- \u00b7 The views and interests of its key stakeholders. The Board seeks to understand the views of key stakeholders in order to inform effective decision-making and to deliver long-term success. It identifies  our  core  stakeholders  as:  customers  and  communities;  colleagues;  investors; suppliers; and regulators.\n\nBy taking regard of these factors, the Board seeks to ensure that the Directors have acted both individually and collectively in a way that would, in good faith, be considered likely to promote the success of the Group while having due regard to all its stakeholders and to the matters set out in paragraphs a to f of section 172 of the Companies Act 2006.\n\nFurther information of our consumer duty can be found on page 23 of the strategic report.

They trust us to be a responsible business, whether that's by supporting the communities we serve and source from, managing our environmental impacts or contributing to a healthier, more inclusive society.\n\nWe strive to do the best for our customers and the business, addressing key ESG issues and living up to our Sainsbury's values. We are committed to driving improvements across the ESG agenda while also leveraging Sainsbury's environmental agenda.\n\nThe section below gives more details on our Environmental and Social strategy and along with some of our successes to date. Refer to page 36 for our section on Governance.\n\n## Environmental strategy\n\nThis is the  Group's  third year of reporting against the recommendations set out by the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD).

It also has an objective of ensuring that key product and process decisions and the allocation of change resources/change  programmes  consider  the  environmental  risk  impact  in  a  proportionate  way  and  that  this  is  appropriately documented.\n\nThe Group complies with Section 172(1) of the Companies Act 2006 which sets out the matters that directors must have regard to in fulfilling their duties to promote the success of the company, which include the interests of various stakeholders, and, in doing so, have regard to the impact of the company's operations on the community and the environment.\n\n## The Board's oversight of climate-related risks and opportunities\n\nThe Bank Board is the key governance body, meeting at least eight times a year, holding overall accountability for the decisions made and outcomes achieved by the Group, subject to specific reserved matters that require the consent of J Sainsbury plc.\n\nSee page 36 for the full committee structure diagram.\n\n## Board\n\nThe Board reviews and approves the Group's ESG strategy on an annual basis as well as the ESG policy and associated risk appetite metrics. The Board approves the Group's Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP), which includes climate stress testing analysis, and the strategic report that contains disclosures in respect of the environment.\n\nAt its meeting in September 2023, the Board approved the annual refresh of the Group's Corporate Plan which considered, amongst other items, the Plan's impact on the future strategy across the ESG spectrum in relation to the Group's product portfolios.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The BRC reviews and recommends to the Board the approval of the Group's ICAAP (which includes climate stress testing analysis).\n\nAt its meeting in June 2022, the BRC approved the Group's ESG Risk Policy and Appetite following review and discussion at ERC via the ESG Forum. The High-Level Risk Appetite metrics were reported for the first time at the October 2023 committee and are presented at each meeting.\n\n## Audit Committee\n\nThe Audit Committee reviews the Taskforce for Climate-related Financial Disclosures ('TCFD') included in the Group's Annual Report, considering the evolving regulatory landscape.\n\nIn addition, a high-level summary of the Group's current and emerging risk profile, which includes any climate-related financial risks, are presented as part of the CRO's risk report.\n\n## Remuneration Committee\n\nThe Remuneration Committee ensures that ESG-related commitments are included, and assessed, as part of the Executive balance scorecard which is used in assessing variable remuneration.

The ESG forum is chaired by the Chief Risk Officer (CRO), who is the Senior Manager responsible under the Senior Management and Certification Regime (SMCR) for managing the financial risks from climate change. The ESG Forum is attended by management-level colleagues from relevant areas of the Group so they can be kept informed about (and support with) climate-related issues that are monitored as they arise. ESG-related risks are identified and reviewed along with a materiality assessment using the Group's Operational Risk Assessment Impact Matrix.\n\n## Asset and Liability Committee (ALCo)\n\nALCo oversees the approach and results of climate-related stress testing which is included in the Group's ICAAP.\n\n## Wholesale Credit Risk Forum\n\nThe Wholesale Credit Risk Forum review exposures, limits, and counterparty credit risk performance with regards to ESG-related assets.\n\n## Strategy\n\nThe Group's broader ESG approach is a 'pragmatist strategy', as agreed by Board, of doing what is right and sensible for both our customers and our wider business whilst ensuring we meet our legal and regulatory requirements related to climate risk. As the Group is included within the Sainsbury's Group's Net Zero Commitment, we aim to ensure that our Scope 1 and 2 emissions are net zero by 2035 and our Scope 3 emissions are net zero by 2050 and that they are appropriately monitored, measured, and aligned to this target.\n\nThe  Group's key strategic climate-related objectives are proportionate to the Group's  broader strategy which is based solely on unsecured lending with no mortgage portfolio (sold in 2023) or corporate lending propositions,  as well as being predominantly outsourced and having no appetite for any exposure to carbon intensive industries.\n\n## These objectives are summarised below:\n\n- 1. Assess Climate-related risks & opportunities - measure, manage and disclose climate risks and opportunities.",

Alignment with industry developments - ensure that the Group remains in line with climate-related developments.\n- 4. No direct support or investment in carbon related assets - the Group's Wholesale Credit Risk Policy states that the Group will not directly finance companies or organisations whose main activities actively contribute to climate change.\n- 5. Managing Scope 3 emissions -  ensuring that we focus on addressing Scope 3 emissions as well as being aware of future market developments in how this is measured.\n\nIt is noted that the announced planned strategic shift in the Group's product offering to a distributed model through dedicated financial service providers, resulting in a phased withdrawal from its core banking business over time, will have an impact on future ESG goals. This will be subject to ongoing review as part of the ESG Forum as these broader strategic changes develop.\n\n## Climate-related risks and opportunities identified over the short, medium and long term\n\n## Definition of Time Horizons\n\n| Time Horizon   | Time Horizon   | Description                                             |\n|----------------|----------------|---------------------------------------------------------|\n| Short Term     | 0 to 3 years   | Over the Group's planning horizon                       |\n| Medium Term    | 3 to 5 years   | Over the Group's planning horizon                       |\n| Long Term      | 5 to 30 years  | Determined by ICAAP climate risk stress testing horizon |\n\n## Climate-related risks\n\nRisks to the Bank from climate change arise through two factors, physical and transition risk. Further details of our assessment of these risks and mitigants is noted within the Risk management section of the TCFD report.\n\nThe Bank has assessed and judged the materiality of the related risks based on their relevance to our business model and operating environment using an operational risk impact assessment matrix included within the Enterprise Risk Management Framework (ERMF). This assesses the impact and likelihood of occurrence of each risk which results in a risk score and rating, with 'High' being a severe impact and almost certain of occurring (>\u00a35m financial impact), 'Medium' being a significant and possible (\u00a30.25m-\u00a33m impact) and 'Low' being unexpected and minor (<\u00a30.25m).\n\n| Climate  risk  factor                             |                               | Key drivers                                          | Materiality  based  on  business model   | Horizon      | Horizon      |\n|---------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|\n|                                                   | and weather-related events.   | and frequency of extreme climate  Flooding Wildfires | Medium                                   |              |              |\n|                                                   | and weather-related events.   | and frequency of extreme climate  Flooding Wildfires | Subsidence                               | Low          |              |\n|                                                   | and weather-related events.   | Coastal erosion                                      | Low                                      | Low          |              |\n| Physical  risks                                   | and weather-related events.   | Heatwaves                                            | Low                                      | Low          |              |\n|                                                   | and weather-related events.   |                                                      | Low                                      | Low          |              |\n|                                                   | and weather-related events.   | Hurricanes                                           | Low                                      | Low          |              |\n| the  process  of  adjustment towards a low carbon | Government/Regulatory  Policy |                                                      | High                                     | Medium  term | Medium  term |\n| the  process  of  adjustment towards a low carbon | Government/Regulatory  Policy | Carbon pricing                                       | Medium                                   | Medium  term | Medium  term |\n| the  process  of  adjustment towards a low carbon | Government/Regulatory  Policy | Consumer sentiment                                   | Medium                                   | Medium  term | Medium  term |\n| the  process  of  adjustment towards a low carbon | Government/Regulatory  Policy | Investor sentiment                                   | Medium                                   | Medium  term | Medium  term |\n| the  process  of  adjustment towards a low carbon | Government/Regulatory  Policy |                                                      |                                          | Long Term    | Long Term    |\n| the  process  of  adjustment towards a low carbon | Government/Regulatory  Policy | Technological change                                 | Low                                      |              |              |\n\n## Climate-related opportunities\n\nAs well as risks, the Group has identified several potential climate-related opportunities as part of our support of the transition to a net zero economy, which will be appropriately assessed in terms of their financial impact and viability.\n\n| Opportunities                                                                                                                                                                        | Description   | Stakeholders                 | Horizon           |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|------------------------------|-------------------|\n| Ongoing  assessment  whether  there  exists  a  market for new products to help Group customers  reduce their carbon footprint, keeping us aligned  with customer sentiment.         | Customers     | Medium term                  | Green finance     |\n| Engagement  with  colleagues,  customers,  and  suppliers to increase understanding of climate- related risks and drive transition to net zero.

As part of this process,  the financial risks and opportunities from climate change are considered and assessed based on key inputs gathered from across the Group,  which is then reviewed and approved by  Board. Additionally, each business product owner is asked to consider the climate impact of their product and steps taken to reduce that impact.\n\nThe corporate plan is also the basis on which climate-related stress testing is undertaken and used as a means of quantifying the materiality of the risks based on the Group's chosen strategy. At the current time, the financial risks from climate change to the Group are low as there are no significant impacts on our financial performance or financial position from climate-related issues, and this is expected to remain so over the current planning horizon.\n\nOur business strategy is most likely to be impacted by climate-related risks and opportunities in the following ways:\n\n| Key potential impacts                                                                                                                                                                     | Group response                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Physical Risks                                                                                                                                                                            |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| as flooding, may impact the resilience of  our  operations  through  damage  to  our  premises, infrastructure, and disruption to  our  critical  third-party  services  and  colleagues. | Edinburgh will end in 2024 and the new building that has been chosen has a much  smaller footprint to ensure we are matching our needs with our demands.

As the exercise was released in 2021, the Early Action scenario assumes the beginning of the transition in that year. The scenarios assess the potential impacts from different combinations of physical, transition and economic risks over a 30-year period. Impacts on expected losses are modelled on a static balance sheet i.e., assuming no new business or repayments of assets and liabilities and no management actions. It is noted that the modelling of climate change impacts is complex and uncertain, which is primarily driven from the long-time horizons that the risks are expected to materialise over, as well as uncertainties and impacts of future government climate-related policies.\n\n## Scenario description\n\n| Late Action                                          |                                                        | Early Action                                                                               | No policy Action              |\n|------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|\n| Disorderly transition to a net  zero economy by 2050 | Orderly  transition  to  a  net  zero economy by 2050. | No  further  climate  policy  leading  to  3.3\u00b0C degree increase in temperatures  by 2050. | Description                   |\n| High                                                 | Medium                                                 | Low                                                                                        | Transition risk               |\n| 2031                                                 | 2021                                                   | n/a                                                                                        | Transition begins             |\n| Sudden recession                                     | Temporary downturn                                     | Significant downturn                                                                       | Economic impact               |\n| Low                                                  | Low                                                    | High                                                                                       | Physical risk                 |\n| Limited to +1.8\u00bac                                    | Limited to +1.8\u00bac                                      | Reaches +3.3\u00bac                                                                             | Global  temperature  increase |\n\n## Scenario conclusions\n\nThe exploratory climate scenario analysis completed during 2023 has provided the following insights:\n\n- \u00b7 The primary risk associated with the Early Action scenario is ensuring that there is an adequate framework in place to assess the risks from climate change as transitions risks emerge. This is detailed in the Risk Management section.\n- \u00b7 The Group has limited impacts to physical risks both currently and under a range of future climate paths modelled over the next 30 years as the Group does not have a mortgage portfolio or undertake any corporate lending.",

        "page_content": "## Strategic report\n\n- \u00b7 Most material impacts are related to transition risks under a late or no action scenario where overall actions to achieve a net zero are disorderly significantly impacting economic conditions. For the Group an increase in unemployment has a direct increase in total expected losses, however even under these scenarios the Group's business model and capital position were found to be resilient to the risks. If the stress results were deemed to be significantly material, then a re-assessment of the Group's strategy would be undertaken.\n- \u00b7 The Group continues to review and refine our scenario testing capabilities as additional data becomes available and further industry good practice emerges.\n\n## Risk management\n\nThe financial risks from climate change are included within the Environmental Risk component of the ESG principal risk type that forms part of the ERMF. The two key sub-categories of Environmental Risk are highlighted below, which can manifest principally via increases to the Group's other principal risk  categories, namely retail and wholesale credit, market, reputational, operational, regulatory, legal, technological or liquidity and funding risks.\n\nTransition risks: These arise from the adjustment towards net-zero emissions, which will require significant structural changes to the economy. These changes will prompt a reassessment of a wide range of asset values, a change in energy prices and a fall in income and creditworthiness of some borrowers. In turn, this entails potential credit losses for lenders and market losses for investors. The transition to a net-zero economy also presents some opportunities for the financial sector, which are noted in detail below.\n\nPhysical risks : These risks arise from the increasing severity and frequency of climate and weather-related events, such as sea-level rise and floods. These events damage property and other infrastructure, disrupt business supply chains, impact agricultural output and, more broadly, can lead to loss of life and migration. This reduces asset values, results in lower profitability for companies, damages public finances, increases the cost of settling underwriting losses for insurers and may lead to gaps in insurance coverage. Indirect effects on the macroeconomic environment, such as lower output and productivity, exacerbate these direct impacts.\n\n## Our processes for identifying and assessing climate-related risks\n\nClimate-related financial risks are currently low for the Group as it does not expect these risks to have a significant impact on its profitability or capital position now or over its 5-year corporate planning horizon. This conclusion is primarily driven from the fact that its lending portfolios are on an unsecured basis following the sale of the mortgage portfolio in 2023, so the key financial risks from climate change are more closely linked to the wider transition risks faced by the UK.\n\nTo ensure that these conclusions are regularly reviewed and validated, certain risk management processes and methodologies, aligned to the ERMF, are used to facilitate the ongoing identification, assessment, treatment, and monitoring of this risk type and of its materiality to the Group. A summary of the key elements of this process are noted below:\n\n- \u00b7 Regulatory horizon scanning -  The Group  runs a robust horizon scanning process to identify, action and monitor any regulatory developments relating to climate risk matters which could impact corporate objectives and the delivery of our strategy. Each new development is flagged, assigned to a relevant individual/team, prioritised, and tracked through to compliance with oversight provided by the ESG Forum, Executive Risk Committee and Board Risk Committee.\n- \u00b7 Emerging risk review process -  Within its suite of risk committee-level reporting, any key emerging risks connected to climate-related financial risks are identified, tracked, and discussed where appropriate at the ESG Forum, ERC and/or BRC.\n- \u00b7 Risk appetite & monitoring - A high level risk appetite metric is in place for ESG risk, which is tracked by the ESG Forum, ERC and BRC. This is subject to an annual review and recalibration in line with the Group's broader review of all its other high level risk appetite metrics.\n- \u00b7 Stress testing (including operational risk scenarios) The financial risk impact of climate risk on our portfolios is assessed via stress testing which is quantified within the Group's ICAAP. This considers potential financial vulnerabilities as a result of three climate scenarios set out by the BoE as part of the Climate Biennial Exposure Scenarios (CBES) exercise. Additionally, scenario analysis is used as part of the ICAAP to ensure the Group  retains sufficient capital for extreme, but plausible, operational risk events.\n- \u00b7 Incident management processes Maintenance of an operational risk management framework, outlining the process for identification, assessment, mitigation and monitoring of operational risks, incident management protocols and reporting any operational risk losses are in place. This can be used to track for any potential physical risk events and assessing the materiality of any impacts.",

This  involves  assessing  the  potential  impact  and  likelihood  of  risk  crystallisation  using  approved  risk measurement tools, making a materiality determination, and escalating through the risk governance and committee structures as appropriate.\n\n## How our processes for identifying, assessing, and managing climate-related risks are integrated into the organisation's overall risk management\n\nThe Group's broader ESG approach is a 'pragmatist strategy', as agreed by Board, of doing what is right and sensible for both our customers and wider business whilst ensuring it meets legal and regulatory requirements, including the Sainsbury's Group's Net Zero Commitment by 2035. The Group's associated risk management approach is aligned to this strategy, and we have developed a climate risk management framework, which forms part of the ERMF, to ensure that climate risks and opportunities are appropriately identified, measured, managed, monitored, and reported.\n\nThe Group includes the financial risks from climate change within its ESG principal risk which is defined as the risks of any financial losses, reputational damage or failing to meet minimum regulatory requirements stemming from ESG-related factors. These factors have a bearing on existing risks across the Group's other principal risk types (i.e., credit, market, or operational-related risks).\n\nThe management of climate-related risks and opportunities has been incorporated into existing governance and risk management processes, where appropriate, and ensures that the risks are being managed in line with the Board approved risk appetite.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Strategic report\n\n- \u00b7 Governance & reporting - The Chief Risk Officer (CRO) has been identified as the Senior Manager responsible under the Senior Management and Certification Regime for managing the financial risks from climate change. Executive Risk Committee (ERC) and Board Risk Committee (BRC) have oversight of climate-related financial risks and receive monthly high level risk appetite metrics related to climate risk. The Bank Board receive regular updates on specific plans to meet our climate strategy and progress against our targets. The Group  is  aligned with Sainsbury's  Group governance on ESG matters with the Group's strategy presented at the Sainsbury's Group ESG Steerco. A quarterly ESG forum has been set up to identify and assess climate change impacts in areas such as Strategy, Risk Management and MI and Disclosure. This provides a view of climate-related risks and opportunities which is used to inform progress around the Group's ESG strategy and net-zero commitments.\n- \u00b7 ESG risk policy - The Group has a Board approved ESG risk policy (the 'Policy') and forms part of the Group's suite of principal risk policies. The Policy must be reviewed, updated, and approved on (at least) an annual basis or more frequently if there are material changes required in the management and control of ESG risk within the Group.\n- \u00b7 ESG risk appetite limits -  The Policy includes details of the Board approved High Level risk appetite metric, which is an aggregate measure based on an assessment of each the underlying ESG risk drivers (or directional risk metrics) that are most relevant to the Group. This is reported to the ESG Forum, ERC and BRC and is subject to an annual review and recalibration process in line with the Group's broader risk appetite review.\n- \u00b7 Breaches and escalation processes - A breach is classified as non-compliance with the requirements of the ESG policy where no approved waiver or dispensation is in place. Any breach must be identified and escalated in line with the appropriate process to ensure that appropriate management action is agreed to remediate the breach within approved risk limits. This is fully documented within the Policy and in line with the ERMF.\n- \u00b7 Roles and responsibilities - The Group defines roles and responsibilities in relation to climate risk under the 'three lines of defence' approach.\n\n## Metrics and targets\n\n## The metrics used to assess climate-related risks and opportunities in line with its strategy and risk management process\n\nThe Group's core target is to achieve net zero emissions by 2035 in line with the Sainsbury's Group's Net Zero Commitment - we aim to ensure that our Scope 1 and 2 Emissions, covering our direct and indirect emissions, are appropriately monitored, measured, and aligned to this target. The Group also contributes to the Sainsbury's Group's target for our Scope 3 emissions to be net zero by 2050.\n\nIn addition to achieving net zero emissions, the Group (as part of its Board approved risk appetite framework), has in place specific climate-related risk metrics (non-GHG emissions metrics) which are tracked and reported monthly to the ERC and BRC. These metrics are deemed to be appropriate and proportionate at the current time based on the materiality of the financial risks arising from climate change, which are aligned to the Group's business strategy. In line with the ERMF risk appetite, metrics are subject to an annual review to confirm that they remain fit for purpose or whether new and additional metrics are required. The performance and management of the risk exposures against Board approved metrics are also considered as part of remuneration assessment processes at the year end.\n\nThe key climate-related risk metrics are highlighted below:\n\n- \u00b7 Physical risk events - number of events that are related to specific physical climate risk events that could lead to operational risk losses.\n- \u00b7 Minimum amount of waste recycled - the Group seeks to ensure that a minimum percentage of waste is recycled within its real estate.\n- \u00b7 Wholesale asset investments - the Group is looking to increase investments, where possible, in ESG eligible assets and has set out a minimum target to be reached.\n\nIt is noted that the key risk for the Group remains closely linked to the wider economic risks from climate change or transition risks faced by the UK. This is assessed via specific stress testing as part of the ICAAP process and is deemed immaterial at the current time. The Group does not have any specific risk appetite metric for transition risk; however, it would be considered as part of the Group's capital adequacy principal risk where capital related limits are in place.\n\nWe have ESG related investments within our Treasury liquid asset portfolio, which corresponds to c.2% of our total Treasury assets.",

Over time, as methodologies develop and mature, the Group will look to eventually align with industry standards and, in the interim, look to enhance our own approach where opportunities exist to do so.\n\n## The targets used to manage climate-related risks and opportunities and performance against targets\n\nThe Group has adopted (and feeds into) GHG emission reduction targets from Sainsbury's Group, which are used to monitor progress against the Sainsbury's Group's 'Plan for Better' strategy. These GHG emission reduction targets are measured and monitored at the Sainsbury's Group level. The Group feeds into certain non-GHG emission reduction targets from Group with the same view/approach.\n\nOne of our office sites (Widnes) is split between Sainsbury's Group and Group colleagues, but it should be noted the site as a whole has been included in the below.\n\nAdditional details on the methodologies used to calculate the below targets and measures can be found within the J Sainsbury plc Annual report and Accounts.",

        "page_content": "## Strategic report\n\n## Social Strategy\n\n## Customers\n\nWe have a customer strategy that makes best use of our data and insight to ensure we speak to our customers about relevant topics, in the right way, at the right time and through the right channels. We consider not only acquiring new customers, but also how best to retain, reward and support those already with us. We also want to make sure our services are accessible and easily understood by everyone, including people who have a disability or may need help understanding our more complex products.\n\nWe have now implemented the FCA's new Consumer Duty regulation and as part of this, monitor customer outcomes regularly across all our products and services. This ensures we are delivering good outcomes for our customers,  including  those  with vulnerable characteristics.\n\nCustomer satisfaction is measured through Net Promoter Score (NPS), capturing online and telephone feedback, and is reported to the Board. Findings are used to improve our customers' experience and engagement with knowledge being shared across all our business. We also have a clear process for responding to customer complaints and any key themes that are identified are reviewed by the Board and senior management.\n\n## Communities\n\nThe  Group's Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) Forum supports the work of the ESG Programme Manager in setting our strategic approach as well as how we implement and embed it. By acting in the best interests of all our stakeholders, we can make a sustainable and positive contribution to our community. We also know that playing an active and supportive role in our community is important to our colleagues. It makes us all feel good to know we're doing something for someone else. We actively participate in national awareness events, such as LGBT+ History Month, Black History Month and Purple Tuesday.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn 2023/2024 our colleagues raised over \u00a352,500 for charity, with the majority (\u00a352,000) of that being for Maggie's, who provide free practical, emotional, and social support for people affected by cancer. Maggie's has been our charity partner since 2019 and we have raised over \u00a3200,000 for Maggie's Centres since then.\n\n## Colleagues\n\nWe aim to make the Group a great place to work for all colleagues. Our 'Making it Better Together Group' is part of the Group-wide approach, enabling colleagues' voices to be heard and providing an effective way to communicate what matters to our colleagues to make a difference in our business.\n\nThis financial year, we've continued  to  embed Smarter Working as part of our colleague proposition - which focuses on more efficient meetings and working practices to allow more flexible working for all colleagues. By empowering our teams to work differently, we can individually and collectively be more productive, alongside having more time for customercentric  thinking,  innovation,  focused  work,  and  personal  development.  Unlocking  better flexibility, choice, and balance in the way we work.\n\n## Listening to our colleagues\n\nWe want our colleagues to feel connected and engaged, we measure this through our annual colleague engagement survey The colleague happiness score of 69 is marginally down from 71 last year. Feedback on how line management treat, and support colleagues continues to be a positive, with colleagues saying they felt supported with their wellbeing, are well communicated to and that their line manager is approachable and accessible. We have an active colleague engagement plan that includes ExCo listening sessions, colleague roadshows, and leader events to provide a broad range of opportunities to ask questions and share their feedback.\n\n## A diverse and inclusive place to work\n\nAs part of Sainsbury's Group, we support their goal in being a truly inclusive retailer. The activities we're undertaking to be a more diverse and inclusive organisation are fundamentally about fairness and equality. We are active in our drive for inclusivity and the progression of our diverse talent. With this diversity comes a variety of ideas and views that inform decision-making and enable us to understand our customers better.\n\nBeing an inclusive organisation with diverse representation at all levels of our business is important to us. We acknowledge we still have a way to go, and we are committed to driving positive, sustainable change to improve the lived experience and opportunities for under-represented groups, be they colleagues or customers.",

At our most recent snapshot in April 2023, 83.5% of colleagues shared their ethnicity with us.\n\nWe have a workplace adjustment process to support colleagues with disabilities or long-term health conditions. We often work with our Occupational Health provider and the Government's Access to Work scheme to ensure that we meet their needs. Workplace adjustments can be made at any point of a colleague's employment with us.\n\n## Gender Pay Gap\n\nNote the statutory gender pay gap disclosure is for colleagues employed by the Sainsbury's Bank legal entity. Both the Bank and Argos Financial Services are also included within the J Sainsbury plc Annual report and Accounts.\n\nThe mean gender pay gap of 31.1% (as at April 2023) has marginally improved from 34.3% in April 2022. The gap is, in part, reflective of the number of in-store Travel Money colleagues with around 35% of Sainsbury's Bank colleagues working in these roles on hourly rates of pay and over 71% of these roles being held by women. In addition to the Travel Money colleague composition, Sainsbury's Bank still has more men than women in the most senior roles and more women than men in hourly paid positions, further impacting the pay gap.\n\nThrough the Women in Finance Charter (WIF), we had a target to achieve 40% female representation at senior levels by February 2024. We reached this target last year, with 41% in February 2023, but this has reduced slightly to 39% as of February this year. As a result of the strategic update in January 2024, we're reviewing all resignations that we receive and that will mean several different outcomes, which could include not backfilling all roles, which will have an impact on our representation levels throughout the organisation. We continue to ensure both gender and ethnicity is moderated through our talent and recruitment processes and will keep monitoring over the coming months but anticipate there could be further movement.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe  actively  support  our  colleagues  of  all  gender  identities  through  our  inclusion  strategy  and  our  LGBT+  colleague  network, Proud@Sainsbury's.\n\n## Ethnicity Pay Gap\n\nSainsbury's Group include voluntary disclosures on the ethnicity pay gap at a Sainsbury's Group level. This disclosure includes Group colleagues.\n\n## Human rights and modern slavery\n\nThe Group has zero tolerance towards modern slavery and human trafficking. We are committed to acting ethically and with integrity in all our business relationships. We work closely with our business partners and suppliers to ensure there is no place for modern slavery and human trafficking in any area of our business (including our supply chain). Our policies and procedures support and encourage colleagues to raise concerns relating to modern slavery or the suspected presence of it in our supply chain at the earliest opportunity. The Group's Modern Slavery Statement is published on our website.\n\n## Anti-corruption / Anti-bribery\n\nThe Group is exposed to the risk of facilitating bribery or aiding corruption through the provision of financial services. This risk is managed through a clear set of policies, procedures and controls which are communicated to colleagues through regular mandatory training. The training material is reviewed and updated to reflect changes in legislation or best practice . The Supply Chain Management team regularly monitors suppliers to ensure that processes and controls are in line with the Group's required standards.",

Our Board sets our risk appetite to support and protect investor value and to ensure we operate within appropriate and agreed levels and types of risks.\n\nThe  Sainsbury's  Group's  interests  are  represented  by  an  appointed  non-executive  director  to  ensure  effective  challenge  and collaboration to grow our connected services. Where interests are not aligned, this is managed through disclosure and activities to minimise potential conflicts. In the financial year, the Sainsbury's Group appointed non-executive director resigned and a new nonexecutive director is expected to be appointed in May 2024.\n\n## Suppliers\n\nOur Board understands the importance of our supply chain in delivering our plans and the long-term success of the business. We seek a strong degree of engagement with third party suppliers across the end-to-end supplier management process, from sourcing to procurement to relationship management to contract reviews. We recognise that when we outsource a service, we do not outsource the responsibility. We ensure our suppliers are compliant with regulatory requirements and have the necessary controls in place to manage risks effectively to make sure we continue to meet a high standard of conduct for our customers. Our Supply Chain Oversight Committee provides performance oversight of our suppliers and reports to senior management and the Board.\n\nContinuous and pro-active collaboration with our suppliers is undertaken on a regular basis. This provides a forum for developing the business relationship and to ensure we receive an effective service, identify, and manage risk appropriately and operate in line with our values. A key factor in building effective relationships with our suppliers is ensuring our requirements are clear and that they are paid on time. The Group's iSupplier internet portal provides suppliers with access to the purchase orders raised and allows them to allocate their respective invoices once they have fulfilled the order requirements.\n\n## Regulators\n\nWe are regulated by the Prudential Regulation Authority for prudential issues and by the Financial Conduct Authority for conduct of business matters. We engage with regulators on an open, honest, and proactive basis, ensuring full compliance with the letter and spirit of the rules we operate within.\n\nWe recognise the trust that customers place in the Sainsbury's and Argos brands and seek to maintain that by operating in a safe and sound way. Our Conduct and Compliance Director provides oversight of any emerging compliance risks and reports any areas of concern to the Board.\n\n## Strategic review of Financial Services division\n\nOn the 18 January 2024, J Sainsbury plc, the Bank's shareholder, announced that, following a strategic review of its Financial Services division, and consistent with its clear focus on the retail business, there would be a phased withdrawal from the core banking business with financial services products in the future being provided through third parties.\n\nThis decision, taken with the full support of the Bank Board, recognises that, in the period since the Bank was first launched in 1997, there has been a significant level of change in the financial services industry with increased competition, more sophisticated customer expectations and reduced margins, all of which have impacted the long-term strategic aim of the Group to be the provider of financial services for loyal Sainsbury's customers.\n\nIdentifying that financial services could still unlock additional value through meeting certain customer needs around credit and loyalty, Sainsbury's commissioned a series of independent third-party reviews to answer the following three questions:\n\n- \u00b7 What are the financial service needs of Sainsburys/ Argos customers?\n- \u00b7 Where is the best place for these services to be provided?\n- \u00b7 What operating model is required to support the future direction?\n\nFollowing these reviews, the Board and the Bank's shareholder recognised that there were several alternative operating models in which the Group could both improve the financial services products offered to Sainsbury's customers whilst also continuing to support a clear strategic focus on the Group's retail business.\n\nThroughout the strategic review, the Board has been fully engaged with the development of the proposals and, where appropriate, has utilised its sub-committees to rigorously interrogate the range of potential outcomes ensuring that central to these discussions were, (i) customers, (ii) colleagues, (iii) risk mitigation, (iv) brand and reputation, and (v) key business partners. During the year the Board devoted extensive time at its meetings in evaluating the potential impact of the strategic change on the Bank, its subsidiaries, and its stakeholders. A dedicated change programme was established, and the Programme Director and the Accountable Executive provided regular updates to the Board throughout.",

        "page_content": "## Strategic report\n\nAhead of the announcement by J Sainsbury plc on the 18 January 2024, the Board met to consider and confirm that, from the perspective of the Group, the preparatory work required to support the announcement, including a detailed risk assessment, had been undertaken and that there were appropriate plans in place to mitigate the risks identified.\n\nDuring the coming year, the Board and the Bank's shareholder will critically evaluate the opportunities available to support the Group in continuing to offer high-quality, great value financial services products through a distributed model, as is already the case with the existing insurance products. Whilst there are alternative operating models which could achieve this goal, the Board will critically evaluate the options, and subsequent execution plans, against a range of criteria including the delivery of good customer outcomes and continued compliance with existing policies and regulations.\n\nThe Board recognises that this will be a significant period of change for the Group and the intention is to provide clarity to customers, colleagues, and other stakeholders on the future strategic direction of the Group through regular updates throughout the coming year. In the short term, there will be no immediate changes to the Group's existing products and services. Members of the Board and the Group's senior management are actively engaging with its regulators throughout this process.\n\n## Disposal of the mortgage portfolio\n\nFollowing a strategic decision taken in 2019 to discontinue new mortgages lending, the Bank had sought to sell the portfolio as a final step towards additional simplicity, cost reduction and eliminate the residual operational and conduct risks associated with running a small historic portfolio of assets.\n\nThe Board sought to minimise the impact on colleagues, with only 2-3 individuals working directly on the mortgage book in the run up to the sales, with the wider operation  supported by central functions and outsourced service providers. The sale would provide customers with more choice in terms of products and reduce the operational risk associated with managing a small book in run-off with limited resources. In recognising the fostering of good relationships with suppliers, the Board ensured that consultation took place between the Bank and the main third-party servicing supplier that would be impacted by the sale. The supplier was then engaged with possible purchasers who would likely continue to use them as a servicer in the medium term. In recognising the need to act fairly, it was warranted that any transaction would be completed at Fair Value thus ensuring all parties were treated fairly.\n\nAfter careful consideration the Board determined that the Mortgage sale would benefit the company and was in line with the Company's strategy, at the time of August 2023, to reshape the balance sheet, simplify the organisation and strengthen the business for the benefit of its stakeholders. The priority for the Bank had been to find a buyer that would best meet the needs of its mortgage customers and the Board concluded that the purchasing entity would serve these customers well.\n\n## Consumer Duty\n\nDuring the financial year, the Board and management continued preparation for the Consumer Duty regulation and invested extensive time and effort into understanding and monitoring the implementation of the FCA's Consumer Duty rules. This followed and built on, the extensive Consumer Duty work that was detailed in the Strategic Report in the previous year. The Bank's Chief Customer Officer continued to be the Accountable Executive for delivery of the project although, given the cross-cutting nature of the Consumer Duty rules, other Senior Manager Functions (SMF) holders within the Group  remained accountable for delivering different aspects of it.  Rosanne Murison, a non-executive director, continued as Consumer Duty Board Champion and, with the Chair, CEO and Accountable Executive, ensured that project and business delivery, and customer outcomes monitoring results were being regularly considered, reviewed and discussed by the Board.\n\nRegular briefings on progress against the agreed milestones were provided to the Board by the Accountable Executive. During the regular briefings, the Board reviewed the embedding and monitoring of customer outcomes across the business and action plans where there could be potential customer harm. In addition, the Board challenged management to ensure that the Group was appropriately identifying all customers with vulnerable characteristics and how outcomes monitoring could be improved.\n\nThe Group achieved compliance with Consumer Duty (open book) for July 2023 (when the new regulation came into effect). Following this deadline, the scope and deliverables for the second phase of the Consumer Duty project were agreed with five workstreams, each with an Executive Committee sponsor. These workstreams were designed to (i) ensure that the new ways of working delivered by the business in phase one were fully embedded, (ii) where management identified material risk of poor customer outcomes (pain points) these areas were rectified quickly, and (iii) ensure that the Mortgages book was compliant with the Consumer Duty requirements at the point of handover to the Co-operative Bank. A suite of new reporting templates was agreed for Customer Outcome Board Reporting which came into use from July 2023 onwards. This reporting included detailed metrics flagging exceptions by Consumer Duty outcome to Executive Committee and the Board, to permit effective escalation and for each SMF to identify trends for discussion and oversight of where corrective actions and plans were being taken. The Group is on track to deliver regulatory compliance by the end of July 2024 for the closed book products.",

The Board was also advised that delivery of Consumer Duty would encourage greater collaboration and shared values with suppliers to achieve fair value and good outcomes for customers, whilst achieving mutually beneficial business models.\n\nOverall, the Board was fully engaged with the development of the plans for compliance with the Consumer Duty regulation to ensure our customers receive good outcomes, devoting extensive time at its meetings, challenging management on progress, signing off the implementation plans and approach as necessary.\n\n## Key performance indicators (KPIs)\n\nThe Group's disclosure of KPIs and Financial Review are completed on a management basis.

The reduction results from margin compression following rising interest rates.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nUnderlying income is 2% lower than prior year, reflecting the sharp and rapid increase in the Bank of England Base Rate adversely impacting our funding costs. Interest payable is up 161% and this cost has not been fully passed on to customers. We have had strong underlying interest receivable growth of 25%, driven by selective unsecured customer lending growth, customer margin management and from growth in Treasury assets. Fee, commission, and other operating income increased by 7%, notably in Travel Money and Argos Care.\n\nUnderlying FS expenses increased by 2% due inflation and higher volumes leading to higher colleague and operating costs only being partially offset by lower fraud losses, marketing spend and depreciation. Our cost to income ratio has increased to 67% (FY 2022/23: 64%), reflecting this pressure on income and costs.\n\nImpairment losses decreased by 5% reflecting the latest economic outlook for inflation and unemployment, a slightly reduced unsecured lending book and broadly stable arrears.  While Loans arrears are slightly higher, this has been offset by lower arrears for Store Cards.  Bad debt as a percentage of lending stayed flat year-on-year at 2.1%.\n\nThe Bank remains well capitalised with a total capital ratio of 19.4%, compared to 17.8% at February 2023, driven by lower customer assets, being both a slightly reduced unsecured lending book and the absence of the mortgage portfolio sold in August 2023.\n\n## Summary income statement and balance sheet\n\nThe Group's performance for the year ended 29 February 2024 and financial position at the end of that period are presented in the income statement and balance sheet.

The Financial Services Business announced a strategy update on the 18 January 2024 which has driven material changes to the results for the year.\n\nThe overall loss of \u00a3161m is largely driven by a number of one-off non-underlying items as a result of the Strategy announcement (totalling \u00a3189m), including the write down of all intangible and tangible fixed assets (see below), and a \u00a37m loss from the mortgage book sale to the Co-operative Bank on 15 August 2023. At the time of sale, the mortgage book value was \u00a3449m.\n\n| Summary balance sheet                     | 2024  \u00a3m   | 2023  \u00a3m   | Change  %   |\n|-------------------------------------------|------------|------------|-------------|\n| Unsecured loans and advances to customers | 4,518      | 4,729      | (4%)        |\n| Secured loans and advances to customers   | -          | 564        | (100%)      |\n| Cash and cash equivalents                 | 1,112      | 646        | 72%         |\n| Debt securities                           | 770        | 741        | 4%          |\n| Intangible assets                         | -          | 179        | (100%)      |\n| Tangible assets                           | -          | 9          | (100%       |\n| Other assets                              | 416        | 341        | 22%         |\n| Total assets                              | 6,816      | 7,209      | (5%)        |\n| Customer deposits                         | 4,165      | 4,735      | (12%)       |\n| Wholesale funds                           | 1,557      | 1,212      | 28%         |\n| Subordinated debt                         | 122        | 122        | 0%          |\n| Other liabilities                         | 223        | 274        | (19%)       |\n| Total liabilities                         | 6,067      | 6,343      | (4%)        |\n| Net assets                                | 749        | 866        | (14%)       |\n\nIn balance sheet terms, our year end unsecured loans and advances to customers decreased by 4%.  Most notably, Credit Card advances decreased by 20% as we reduced non-interest-bearing balances in light of increased funding costs (through reduction of promotion periods and balance transfer offers). Personal loans advances increased by 5%.\n\nCash and cash equivalents increased 72% and debt securities by 4% reflecting our investment of excess deposits in additional high quality liquid assets.\n\nAs referenced above, intangible and tangible fixed assets have been fully written down as a result of the announced change in strategy. Mortgage balances, our secured loans, were sold in the year.\n\nAs we optimised funding, customer deposits reduced by 12%.  We carefully managed our customer rates to allow our deposit balances to fall as our lending balances reduced.  Wholesale funding was increased to invest high quality liquid assets (being debt securities) for margin.",

We also saw Argos Care Warranty penetration (of eligible sales in Argos) increase.\n\nThe 21% increase in other operating income was driven by our Travel Money business as total sales grew  21%  year-on-year  as international travel was fully open for the entire financial year following the COVID 19 pandemic.\n\n## Operating expenses and investment\n\n| Operating expenses summary                    |   2024  \u00a3m |   2023  \u00a3m | Change  %   |\n|-----------------------------------------------|------------|------------|-------------|\n| Underlying staff costs 1                      |        100 |         94 | 7%          |\n| Underlying operating costs                    |        172 |        165 | 4%          |\n| Depreciation of property, plant and equipment |          1 |          2 | (35%)       |\n| Amortisation of intangible assets             |         24 |         31 | (24%)       |\n| Underlying expenses                           |        297 |        292 | 2%          |\n\n1 Note that underlying staff costs includes payroll costs only.

This has risen from the 281% position in February 2023.\n\n## Risk overview\n\nOn the 18 January 2024, the Group announced a planned strategic shift in its product offering to a distributed model through dedicated financial service providers, which over time will result in a phased withdrawal from its core banking business. This introduces execution related risks as well as a series of other heightened risk types including people, liquidity and funding and profitability impacting capital adequacy. Our existing risk structures, as described below, were assessed and remain fit for purpose as we enter this period of change.\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe Group operates an Enterprise Risk Management Framework (ERMF) which articulates the Group's approach to risk management. It is a core component of our strategy and operations. We adopt a holistic, end-to-end view of risk, ensuring that the principal risks arising from our key processes and activities are effectively identified, assessed, managed, and controlled to make well informed decisions. This is supported and implemented via a three lines of defence model. This framework covers the Bank and its subsidiaries. The Chief Risk Officer performs a strategic risk management role and is responsible for managing and enhancing the ERMF.\n\nOur approach to ERMF includes the following key steps underpinned by a robust risk governance framework:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Risk strategy and culture\n\nOur risk strategy and culture are critical components within the ERMF which outlines the shared set of values and behaviours that defines how all colleagues approach and take ownership for the management of risks within the Group. This approach is underpinned by the Senior Managers and Certification Regime introduced by the FCA in 2016.\n\nThe following key aims and principles define our risk strategy and culture.\n\n| Aims (what)      | Insightful                                   | Customer-Focused                                        | Alert                                               | Resilient                                            | Engaged                                                                    |\n|------------------|----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Principles (how) | We identify and  manage risk  concentrations | Good customer  outcomes are at the  heart of what we do | We anticipate  market trends; we  don't follow them | We fund before we  lend, and control  before we grow | Material risks are  identified, and key  controls are tested  and reported |",

        "page_content": "## Strategic report\n\n## Risk Appetite\n\nOur principal risks represent those financial and non-financial risk types that are most material in the execution of the business strategy. There are ten principal risks which have been recognised and approved by the Board. These are reviewed annually to ensure they remain appropriate.\n\nEach  principal risk identified within the ERMF  has associated  qualitative risk appetite statements that informs our strategy for managing risk. From these statements, specific quantitative metrics are established which articulate how much risk the Group can take in the pursuit of our strategic objectives. These metrics are reviewed and approved by Board on an annual basis.\n\nThe Group's risk appetite reporting structure includes:\n\n- \u00b7 A 'High-Level' Risk Appetite Statement (RAS) that provides a concise set of key Group-wide targets and limits, with a balance of current, forward-looking, and stress-based metrics for financial and non-financial risks.\n- \u00b7 'Directional' RAS limits for each of the Group's principal risk types (e.g. retail credit risk, operational risk). These directional limits are designed to give early indications of changes in the internal and external risk environment, providing an outlook on whether we remain on-track to meet our 'high-level' risk appetite targets.\n\nPerformance against both the 'high-level' and 'directional' RAS measures are monitored and reported to our Executive Risk Committee (ERC) monthly, and at each Board Risk Committee (BRC). Additionally, escalation processes are in place to notify Senior Executives and Board members of any high-level RAS measure operating outside of approved thresholds, including recommendations to reduce exposures back within appetite levels.\n\n## Risk policies\n\nOur risk policies are aligned to the ten principal risk types to which our business model is inherently exposed ( see separate section below ). Each principal risk type has a principal risk owner that actively manages and oversees the risks in the Group in line with associated policy and supporting policy standards. These policies clearly articulate the objectives and requirements to be met to ensure that that these risks are managed effectively on a day-to-day basis, in-line with risk appetite.\n\n## Risk management tools\n\nWe use Process Risks and Control Assessments (PRCAs) to provide a process-centric approach to identify, measure, and control our key risks, which is underpinned by a robust evidence-based assessment of the control environment. Each material risk is assessed based on its inherent and residual risk exposure in the prevailing control environment and its target exposure if different from current residual levels. Where it is identified that controls need to be strengthened, treatment plans are put in place and actioned to mitigate the risk. This process, whilst in operation, is one which continues to be refined and matured to ensure the organisation's control environment is operating within our risk appetite.\n\nOur Business Enterprise Risk Tool (BERT) is used to record and manage our key processes, the controls we have in place, any treatment plans to improve our control environment and to record our management of risk events. All required colleagues have access to BERT enabling them to view risk data against their own processes as well as across the organisation.\n\nWe continually look to improve our controls in line with industry best practice and the environment in which we operate.\n\n## Risk reporting\n\nOur risk reporting processes are critical to understanding the specific and aggregate levels of risk to which we are exposed and the effectiveness of our controls to manage these risks. We promote insightful reporting at all levels to encourage debate on what matters most, and to ensure effective action is being taken at an appropriate level to address any current or emerging areas of concern.\n\n## Resilience plans and stress testing\n\nFinancial and Operational Resilience are key areas of focus. Our capital and liquidity adequacy are assessed on at least an annual basis through the Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment process (ICAAP) and the Internal Liquidity Adequacy Assessment process (ILAAP). Business recovery plans for severe incidents are reviewed on a regular basis, while our Recovery and Resolution Plans review and test our playbooks and recovery capacity in response to extreme but plausible threats to our viability. The Group also undertakes selfassessment of its Operational Resilience Framework on an annual basis, which is approved by the Board.  It is noted that, ordinarily, the Group would undertake an annual test of its Liquidity Contingency Plan. However, this was superseded as the Group made live preparations ahead of the strategic announcement and for a period after to assess for any increases in liquidity outflows. This included increased oversight and governance via ALCo and daily liquidity interlock meetings which reviewed and confirmed the adequacy of available liquidity options that could be deployed in a stress supported by detailed daily MI to detect any early warning indicators.\n\n## Risk management structure\n\nWe adopt a Three Lines of Defence framework to provide a basis for the identification and management of all risks associated with our business model and strategy, which ensures there is effective oversight and challenge in place.\n\nOur Three Lines of Defence framework is deployed on the following basis:",

Primary responsibility for the identification, management, monitoring and control of risks rests with our commercial and operational teams. The first line teams, as subject matter experts, own the processes and controls used to manage risks within risk appetite complying with requirements detailed within risks policies and policy standards.\n- \u00b7 Second line . The independent risk management division is responsible for setting risk frameworks, policies, guidance and oversight within which the first line can manage its risks.\n- \u00b7 Third line. Our internal audit division provides independent assurance on the effectiveness of risk management and internal control processes in mitigating and reporting risks.\n\n## Emerging Risks\n\nWe regularly monitor emerging and evolving changes in the risk environment in order to promote early discussion to understand and address any threats or opportunities to our business model. We consider specific emerging threats and opportunities under the following broad themes:\n\n- \u00b7 Strategic . Reflects both our business model and the markets in which we operate. For example, regular consideration is given to changes in the competitive market resulting from new entrants or mergers and acquisitions (M&A) activity, and any resultant impact on margins.\n- \u00b7 Operational . Reflects changes in technology, the impact of internal processes or emerging external best practices. For example, we continually review the evolving nature of cyber-crime and its impact on the Group  in terms of financial losses and operational costs to protect our customers.\n- \u00b7 Geo-political and economic. Reflects the impact of macroeconomic conditions and government policy on our markets. For example, we continue to reflect on UK market conditions arising from the Russia/Ukraine conflict and the impact changes in interest rates, inflation, the employment market, or house prices may have on the availability and demand for our products.\n- \u00b7 Regulatory and conduct .  Reflects  continued  developments  within  the  financial  services  sector  including  PRA  and  FCA consultations and changes to Basel regulations.\n\nAs more information is known about an emerging risk relevant to the Group, it will be subject to a full risk assessment. Actions will then be taken to manage and control the risk, unless it is assessed as not relevant or not material to the Group.\n\nEconomic and rate volatility High interest rates and sustained pressures on the cost of living, mostly driven by higher energy and food prices,  created uncertain economic conditions in 2023 straining customer's household incomes and their ability to spend. Customer impacts are closely monitored with support offered as required. The Group also undertakes stress testing scenarios to ensure it has enough capital and liquidity to operate over a range of economic outcomes, including higher inflation.\n\nGeopolitical environment -The impact of increasing geopolitical risks, via Russia and Ukraine as well as with the expansion of tensions in the Middle East, further exacerbates potential downside economic risks in energy and commodity shortages, impacting the economic environment.\n\nCyber-attacks There is a constantly evolving threat from cyberattacks that are increasing in terms of sophistication, impact, severity and frequency. Continuing and further geopolitical tensions also raises our inherent risk profile with heightened monitoring in place for the detection of ransomware attacks. We also see data protection risks increasing as a function of cyber threats, which may feed through into higher conduct and fraud risk (anti money laundering and sanctions risks) if we were to witness non-compliant use of data.\n\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) and ethical data practices The increased speed of change with regards to technological advancements relating to AI and machine learning is recognised. In particular, the need to balance competing priorities of maximising customer experience or opportunities with the need to ensure that trust and confidence is maintained in customer data privacy, protecting customers from fraud as well as adhering evolving data privacy regulations.\n\nClimate change - Climate change risks represent a source of systemic risks in the financial system and more specifically the potential for increased financial impacts both from physical and transition risks which could lead to widespread disruption. Further details are included in our Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) included on page 7.",

        "page_content": "## Strategic report\n\n## Principal risks\n\nFollowing the Sainsbury's Group's strategy announcement execution risk , which can arise from a failure to execute its business strategy as a result of poor decision making, substandard execution of decisions, inadequate resource allocation or from failure to effectively respond to changes in the business/market environment is a key focus and has had a knock on impact on the Group's risk strategy, existing Principal risk types (noted in the table below) and therefore to risk exposures.\n\nIn  this  context,  an  assessment  of  the  impact  of  the  strategy  change  on  the  Group's  risk  profile  was  completed  to  inform  a recommendation by the Bank Board to Sainsbury's Group ahead of a final decision to proceed with the proposed strategy completed by our second line risk function. This assessed each of the Group's principal risk types and highlighted where any material shifts were noted and included the following:\n\n- \u00b7 People risk: As a smaller bank, we retain a relatively concentrated pool of expertise and senior experience, making it essential that we retain critical subject matter experts, including within regulated roles., despite personal uncertainty arising from the strategy.  Whilst currently contracting with third party suppliers of skilled contingency resource, it should not be assumed that critical embedded knowledge (e.g. detail of the Group's technology suite and data) can be readily supplanted.  Further, there is a cultural risk as colleagues may become disenfranchised and contract resources may not be invested in corporate values, posing risks to execution quality, customer outcomes, and risk management such as cyber awareness.\n\nKey actions: Investment in appropriate measures to retain, motivate and incentivise key staff, Additionally, securing third party expertise on areas where the Group currently lacks capacity, expertise, or capability, along with enhanced tracking of cultural indicators. Opportunities to review and/or stagger upcoming activities i.e. change portfolios.\n\n- \u00b7 Fraud: Customers will be targeted with scam messages, e.g. instructions to move money / divulge security codes, immediately following any announcements.  Changes to normal patterns of activity (e.g. heightened savings flows) may obscure detection of abnormal events central to controls. Insider fraud risk is also heightened due to job insecurity, potential for higher staff turnover and use of contractors, and supplier performance of operational processes may degrade.  Despite sound controls evidenced in BAU performance, residual risk remains elevated due to anticipated inbound attack volumes.\n\nKey  actions :   Tighten  authentication  limits,  complete  implementation  of  behavioural  biometrics,  increase  customer messages, daily monitoring, enhanced industry intelligence gathering.\n\n- \u00b7 Liquidity  risk: Liquidity  impacts  may  stem  from  increased  and  unpredictable  customer  deposit  withdrawals,  reducing financial soundness and regulatory compliance buffers.  However, the Group has a mature control environment with ALCO governance, ILAAP stress testing, and daily MI generation.  In addition to a strong ingoing liquidity position, action has already been implemented to diversify funding sources and top up collateral at the Bank of England. It is noted that available liquidity resources significantly exceed modelled plausible stress outflow scenarios. However, poorly handled communications, adverse media coverage, mis-information on social media, or operational outages could cause unpredictable stress.\n\nKey actions: Enhanced ALCO oversight including continuous vigilance over daily liquidity movements, product pricing and offerings could be adjusted to counter outflows.\n\n- \u00b7 Cyber risk: Malicious actors are likely to seek to exploit perceived vulnerabilities, e.g. data exfiltration / lax phishing control discipline due to disenfranchised or inexperienced staff and contractors, any failure to promptly patch system vulnerabilities, and potential large movements of customer data and/or technology change during a sale or transitional service process.\n\nKey  actions: Enhanced  colleague  monitoring,  strengthened  /  restricted  data  loss  prevention  protocols,  continued investment  in  vulnerability  management,  increased  colleague  awareness  communications,  continued  cross-industry collaboration and intelligence gathering.\n\nChief Risk Officer reporting to Executive Risk Committee (ERC) and Board Risk Committee (BRC) will be used to capture execution risks and monitor how these develop as strategy implementation progresses.  This will be assessed in line with the established Enterprise Risk Management Framework principles.",

Details of the Board composition may be found below. The Directors of the subsidiary entities hold Board meetings to cover statutory matters however the key decision making is covered within the Bank Board.\n\n## Relationship with J Sainsbury Plc\n\nThe Bank is a wholly owned subsidiary of J Sainsbury plc, a listed retailer. J Sainsbury plc is not involved in the day-to-day management of the Group. However, J Sainsbury plc has certain reserved powers and decisions which fall within those powers must be referred to them by the Bank Board for their consent before being confirmed as fully approved. Primarily, these reserved matters relate to significant change in the size and scale of the Group's operations, changes in its capital structure including any increases or decreases to capital, significant contracts or legal disputes, changes to Directors or Officers of the Bank and share schemes.",

        "page_content": "## Strategic report\n\n## Board composition\n\n## Chair\n\nThe Bank has a separate Chair (an Independent Non-Executive Director) and Chief Executive (an Executive Director) to ensure that the balance of responsibilities, accountabilities and decision making are effectively maintained. The Chair plays a key role in creating the conditions for overall Board and individual director effectiveness.\n\n## Balance and diversity\n\nRecruitment on to the Bank Board combines an assessment of both technical capability and competency skills to ensure the optimum blend of individual and aggregate expertise having regards to the Group's long term strategic plan. Such recruitment is subject to the approval of the Nominations Committee, the Bank Board, J Sainsbury plc (as the decision falls within reserved matters) and the relevant regulatory bodies (where applicable).\n\nIndependent Non-Executive Directors bring their experience to bear from across various sectors, notably Financial Services but also from across Retail, Digital and E-Commerce. These are key areas of focus for the Group and aligned to its strategy. Directors update their skills, knowledge and familiarity with the Group by meeting senior management, a programme of developmental training (from both internal and external speakers) and by attending appropriate external seminars. There is an induction programme for all new Directors which is tailored to their specific needs and which provides access to all parts of the business.\n\nThe Independent Non-Executive Directors are wholly independent in that they have no material business or relationships with the company that might influence their independence or judgement. In addition, certain governance responsibilities are delegated to other  Board  Committees  (Audit  Committee,  Board  Risk  Committee,  Remuneration  Committee  and  Nominations  Committee). Membership of these committees is entirely made up of Non-Executive Directors of the Bank with members of the Bank's Executive team and other senior colleagues in attendance. These committees support effective decision making and independent challenge.\n\n## Size and structure\n\nThe structure of the Bank Board seeks to ensure the right leadership is in place to oversee and scrutinise the Bank's long term strategic plan.\n\nThe current Bank Board is comprised of an Independent Chair, four other Independent Non-Executive Directors and two Executive Directors - the Bank's Chief Executive Officer and its Chief Financial Officer. During the year we also had one Non-Executive Director nominated by J Sainsbury plc resign. A biography for each Board Director can be found on the J Sainsbury plc corporate website: www.about.sainsburys.co.uk/about-us/our-management#sainsburys-bank\n\nThe Directors have equal voting rights when making decisions, except the Chair, who has a casting vote at the Bank Board. All Directors have access to the advice and services of the Company Secretary and may, if they wish, take professional advice at the company's expense. Directors' duties are exercised through the Board and its sub-committees per the Governance structure on Page 36. Each of these is chaired by one of the Independent Non-Executive Directors.\n\n## Director responsibilities\n\n## Accountability\n\nEach Board Director has a clear understanding of their accountability and responsibilities via the Individual Accountability Regime. Whilst Board oversight is always maintained, key decisions are made by the individuals and committees with the most appropriate knowledge and experience.\n\nThe Board had a programme of nine main meetings in 2023/24. Additional Board meetings were convened to consider certain matters where it was not felt appropriate to defer until the next full meeting. Governance requirements (including quorum adherence) were applied as if these additional meetings were full Board meetings. A programme of nine main meetings is planned for 2024/25.\n\nOne of the Board meetings is usually set aside each year for strategic planning with the Executive Committee and key stakeholders from across the Group, AFS and J Sainsbury plc as appropriate. As part of their annual review, the Bank Chair undertakes a Fit and Proper Assessment and Attestation with each Board Director. The Senior Independent Non-Executive Director undertakes the same for the Bank Chair.\n\n## Integrity of information\n\nThe Board receives regular and timely information at its meeting on all key aspects of the business supported by a range of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). The Group's various functions prepare and maintain the integrity of this information in accordance with the Group's risk management framework.\n\n## Conflicts of interest\n\nAny potential conflicts of interest are identified and considered as part of the recruitment process for on-boarding new Directors on to the Bank Board. Where there are any concerns raised, they are considered by the Bank's Nominations Committee and again at the Board meeting when the recommendation is brought for approval.",

        "page_content": "## Strategic report\n\nOnce in situ, should a Director be offered the opportunity to take up a position (Executive or Non-Executive), whilst retaining their role on the Bank Board, they are required to inform the Bank Chair and the Board would then be asked to confirm that no conflicts of interest existed or were perceived to exist before accepting the additional role. Where there are any potential conflicts, appropriate safeguards would be implemented.\n\n## Committees\n\nA number of Board functions are delegated to four key sub-committees. The role and scope of authority for each sub-committee is fully outlined in a documented Terms of Reference:\n\n- \u00b7 Audit Committee .  The Audit Committee's key responsibility is to advise the Board on the Group's financial statements, including systems and controls and related policy issues together with relationships with external auditors. The Audit Committee also reviews and challenges where necessary management's response to any major External or Internal Audit recommendations. The Committee is responsible for reviewing and approving the internal audit plan and budget, and for ensuring that the function is adequately resourced. The Audit Committee meets at least four times a year. Additionally, the Audit Committee will meet with the External Auditors and Sainsbury's Bank Internal Audit Director without Executive Management being present.\n- \u00b7 Nominations Committee . The Nominations Committee is responsible for reviewing the structure, size and composition of the Board. The Committee is also responsible for the succession planning of the Board and the Executive Management Team and for ensuring a formal, rigorous and transparent process for recommending appointments to the Board to the Bank's shareholder. The Bank recognises the benefits of achieving a diverse Board and Executive Management Team to reflect the environment in which it operates. The Nominations Committee will meet as required.\n- \u00b7 Remuneration Committee . The role of the Remuneration Committee (RemCo) is to determine and agree with the Board the broad policy for remuneration and for compliance with the Remuneration Code (the Code) to the extent that the provisions apply to the Group. RemCo is responsible for recommending and monitoring the level and structure of remuneration for senior management (categorised as 'Code Staff' for the purposes of the Code) and senior risk management and compliance colleagues.  It continually reviews and assesses the impact of remuneration policies on the risk profile of the Group and employee  behaviour.  RemCo  also  has  oversight  over  appointment  and  severance  terms  for  relevant  employees.  The Remuneration Committee meets at least four times per year.\n- \u00b7 Board Risk Committee . The Board Risk Committee (BRC) provides the Board with a forward-looking view to anticipate future risks together with the monitoring and oversight of existing risks within the Risk Appetite set by the Board. It is responsible for reviewing and reporting its conclusions to the Board on the Group's risk appetite and the Group's risk management framework. The Board Risk Committee meets at least five times a year.\n\n## Strategy and risk management\n\nThe Board is responsible for the overall strategy and performance of the business and its management of risk. Due consideration is given by the Board to the Group's strategy, changes in the operating environment and emerging risks and opportunities.\n\n## Responsibilities\n\nIn line with the provisions of the Senior Manager & Certification Regime (SMCR), the Group has allocated the Senior Manager Functions and prescribed responsibilities in so far as they apply to Sainsbury's Bank plc and its subsidiaries. A Management Responsibility Map (MRM) is in place to provide a description of the Group's management and governance arrangements including the reporting lines and details of the individuals who are part of those arrangements and their prescribed responsibilities. The MRM is owned by the Board.\n\nRisks are identified and managed via the process-centric approach described in the Risk Overview on page 29.\n\n## Remuneration\n\n## Setting remuneration\n\nThe Board-level Remuneration Committee (RemCo) recommends to the Board the remuneration strategy for the Executive Directors, Chair, Senior Management and Material Risk Takers. Within this framework, its remuneration policy is aligned to the long-term success of the Group as well as promoting effective risk management and compliance with applicable statutory and regulatory requirements. RemCo also has oversight over appointment and severance terms for relevant employees.\n\n## Policies\n\nA review is carried out annually (with input from external advisors) to ensure that the remuneration policy and practices are industry competitive  and  in  line  with  the  size  and  complexity  of  the  business  and  compliant  with  all  applicable  legal  and  regulatory requirements. The policy also sets out the approach which ensures that reward decisions are objective, fair and inclusive.",

The  CEO  chairs  the  Executive Committee (ExCo) and is supported by a number of other executive-level committees to provide the appropriate checks, balances and transparency on decision making.\n\nEach committee has a documented Terms of Reference, with delegated authority to the Chair who is the appropriate identified accountable individual in line with their Statement of Responsibilities under FCA and PRA rules (Senior Manager Regime).\n\n## CEO Executive Committee:\n\n- \u00b7 Executive Committee (ExCo).

The ERC meets ten times a year.\n- \u00b7 Retail Credit Risk Committee (RCRC) .

ALCo meets on a monthly basis.\n- \u00b7 Finance Committee .

The role of the committee is to ensure there is an effective group-wide supply chain performance and risk management framework that manages outsourcing, oversees delivery and makes decisions to ensure the Group is able to robustly manage and oversee its suppliers. The Supply Chain Committee meets monthly.\n\n## Divisional Risk Committees\n\nThe role of the Divisional Risk Committee (DRC), chaired by the relevant ExCo member is to ensure the effectiveness of the EWRMF within the Division, so that risks are effectively and consistently managed within the overall approved risk appetite. Each DRC provides input on material risks which may affect the Group to the Executive Risk Committee.\n\n## Pillar 3\n\nThe PRA approved our application for the Bank to become a Small Domestic Deposit Taker (SDDT) effective 11 January 2024. As a result, the Bank is no longer required to report a Pillar 3 Disclosure Report.\n\nBy order of the Board\n\nMichael Larkin Chief Financial Officer 24 April 2024",

The position of members who served during the year is described in the following table:\n\n| Name             | Position                          | Remunerating entity   | Appointment/ resignation  date   |\n|------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------|----------------------------------|\n| Lesley Jones     | Chair (Independent Non-Executive) | Sainsbury's Bank plc  |                                  |\n| Carole Butler    | Senior Independent Non-Executive  | Sainsbury's Bank plc  |                                  |\n| Michael Ross     | Independent Non-Executive         | Sainsbury's Bank plc  |                                  |\n| Guy Thomas       | Independent Non-Executive         | Sainsbury's Bank plc  |                                  |\n| Rosanne Murison  | Independent Non-Executive         | Sainsbury's Bank plc  |                                  |\n| Clodagh Moriarty | Non-Executive                     | J Sainsbury plc       | Resigned 15 May 2023             |\n| James Brown 1    | Chief Executive Officer           | Sainsbury's Bank plc  | Resigned 31 March 2024           |\n| Michael Larkin   | Chief Financial Officer           | Sainsbury's Bank plc  |                                  |\n\nUnless otherwise stated above, all of the Directors in office at the date of this report served throughout the period, and up to the date of approval of these financial statements.\n\n## Board selection criteria\n\nWe regard succession at Board and senior management level as a key priority.  Recruitment into the Board combines an assessment of both technical, leadership capability and competency skills to ensure the optimum blend of individual and aggregate capability having regard to our long-term strategic plan. Board recruitment is subject to the approval of the Nominations Committee, the Board and the relevant regulatory bodies (PRA/FCA).\n\n## Board diversity\n\nWe are committed to promoting a diverse and inclusive workplace at all levels, reflective of the communities in which we do business. Our diversity and inclusion vision aligns with that of our parent J Sainsbury plc whose aim is to be 'the most inclusive retailer'. We will achieve this aspiration by recruiting, retaining and developing diverse and talented people and creating an inclusive environment where everyone can be the best they can be and where diverse views are welcomed. The Nominations Committee is responsible for ensuring there is an appropriate balance of skills and experience across the Board.\n\n## Directors' indemnities\n\nThe Bank has provided an indemnity for the benefit of all of its current Directors which is a qualifying third-party indemnity provision for the purpose of the Companies Act 2006.

As far as each Director is aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the Bank's auditors are unaware.\n\n## Financial risk management\n\nDetails of the use of financial instruments, together with risk management disclosures, can be found in note 33 and the Risk Management section in the Strategic report on pages 29 to 35.\n\n## Future developments\n\nThe development of the Group is set out in the Strategic Report on pages 3 to 5.\n\n## Post balance sheet events\n\nThere were no events occurring after the reporting date that require disclosure or adjustment within the Financial Statements.\n\n## Going concern\n\nThe Directors have considered the appropriateness of the going concern basis of preparation of the financial statements taking into account the Group's current and projected performance with specific additional consideration given to the impacts of the strategic changes to the business as described in the Strategic Report on page 3.   The Directors are satisfied that the Group does not intend to cease trading and has sufficient capital and liquidity to continue trading for the foreseeable future, being at least 12 months from the date of approval of the Financial Statements, taking into account a range of possible operational, economic and legal scenarios. The Directors have also considered factors beyond this timeframe where longer term financial and operational forecasts and scenarios have been prepared. Consequently, the going concern basis continues to be appropriate in preparing the financial statements. Further information on the risks considered in the going concern assessment is set out in Note 1 to the financial statements.\n\n## Dividends\n\nThe Bank loss after tax for the year attributable to the shareholders is \u00a3112m (2023: \u00a323m profit), and on a Group basis including subsidiaries, the loss after tax was \u00a3123m (2023 \u00a333m profit).

Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report. We are independent of the group and parent company in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the UK, including the FRC's Ethical Standard as applied to listed public interest entities, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.\n\nWe believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\n## Conclusions relating to going concern\n\nIn auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate.\n\nWe have considered the appropriateness of the going concern basis of preparation of the financial statements, taking into account the Group's current and projected performance, with specific additional consideration given to the impacts of the strategic changes to the business as described in the Strategic Report on page 3. The strategy change introduces new or increased risks in respect of capital and liquidity adequacy as well as a change as regards the manner in which future trade of the Group is undertaken. As a result, we have expanded the procedures performed in respect of going concern. We also consider going concern to be a key audit matter.\n\nOur evaluation of the directors' assessment of the group and parent company's ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting included:",

        "page_content": "## How we evaluated the directors' assessment\n\n- \u00b7 We obtained an understanding of how the going concern assessment for the group was undertaken, which is summarised in the basis of preparation note 1 on page 60. This included the identification of factors which may arise as a result of the group's change in strategic direction. We considered the appropriateness of the timeframe used by the directors in making their assessment, which included consideration of longer term forecasts than the 12 months minimum timeframe required for forecasting going concern.\n- \u00b7 We obtained an understanding of the directors' rationale for the use of the going concern basis of accounting through reviewing and challenging their going concern assessment and conclusions.\n- \u00b7 We assessed the change in strategic direction announced by the group. We considered whether the planned phased withdrawal from the core banking business represented a cessation of trade.\n- \u00b7 We designed our audit procedures to evaluate the effect of these key judgements on the group's ability to continue as a going concern.\n- \u00b7 We reviewed the directors' evaluation of the group's resilience to financial and operational stress, including severe but plausible scenario analysis performed as part of the group's liquidity stress testing, which took into account the current and forecast levels of liquidity and capital together with the related headroom, including the potential impact of the strategic change and the  risks  arising  thereon.  Their  evaluation  included  the  quantification  of  any  potentially  adverse  impacts  of  customer behaviour.\n- \u00b7 We  evaluated  the  timing  of  repayment  of  external  funding  on  liquidity  requirements,  including  reviewing  regulatory correspondence to understand the impact on those balances described in note 26 on page 94 which have now been classified as current liabilities. We considered the appropriateness and completeness of the stress testing performed by management in light of the planned phased withdrawal of the core banking business. We involved subject matter experts in our assessment to evaluate the completeness of management's considerations. We have challenged management's forecasts and stress tests through independent assessment.\n- \u00b7 We reviewed the group's going concern disclosures included in the financial statements in order to assess whether the disclosures were appropriate, consistent with the risks and responses considered in the going concern assessment, and in conformity with the reporting standards.\n\n## Our key observations in relation to going concern\n\n- \u00b7 We concluded it reasonable that the directors considered that the change in group strategy did not represent a cessation of trade.\n- \u00b7 We have assessed that the severe but plausible scenarios identified by the directors in their stress testing were reasonable.\n\n## Conclusion in relation to going concern\n\nWe have not identified any material uncertainties relating to events or conditions that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the group's ability to continue as a going concern for a period of 12 months from when the financial statements are authorised for issue.\n\nOur responsibilities and the responsibilities of the directors with respect to going concern are described in the relevant sections of this report. However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, this statement is not a guarantee as to the group's ability to continue as a going concern.",

The group has determined that the most significant future impacts from climate change on its operations will be from transitional risks on the wider UK economy. These are explained in the strategic report on page 31. They have also explained their climate commitments on pages 7 to 19 in the Task Force for Climate-related Financial Disclosures. All of these disclosures form part of the 'Other information', rather than the audited financial statements. Our procedures on these unaudited disclosures therefore consisted solely of considering whether they are materially inconsistent with the financial statements, or our knowledge obtained in the course of the audit or otherwise appear to be materially misstated, in line with our responsibilities on 'Other information'.\n\nIn  planning  and  performing  our  audit  we  assessed  the  potential  impacts  of  climate  change  on  the  group's  business  and  any consequential material impact on its financial statements.\n\nThe group has explained in note 33 to the financial statements on page 110 its articulation of how climate change has been reflected in the financial statements and the significant judgements and estimates made in this regard. These disclosures also explain where governmental and societal responses to climate change risks are still developing, and where the degree of certainty of these changes means that they cannot be taken into account when determining asset and liability valuations under the requirements of International Accounting Standards. The group has set out these uncertainties on page 13, within the Strategic Report.\n\nOur audit effort in considering the impact of climate change on the financial statements was focused on evaluating management's assessment of the impact of climate risk, physical and transition, their climate commitments, the effects of material climate risks disclosed on pages 7 to 19 including the significant judgements. As part of this evaluation, we performed our own risk assessment, supported by our climate change internal specialists, to determine the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements from climate change which needed to be considered in our audit.\n\nWhere considerations of climate change were relevant to our assessment of going concern, these are described above. Based on our work we have not identified the impact of climate change on the financial statements to be a key matter or materially impact key audit matters.\n\n## Key audit matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) that we identified. These matters included those which had the greatest effect on the overall audit strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\nIn addition to the key audit matters in the table below our response to the going concern key audit matter is set out in the 'Conclusions relating to going concern' section of this report.",

This included assessing the appropriateness of model design and the formulae used, considering alternative modelling techniques and recalculating the Probability of Default, Loss Given Default and Exposure at Default for a sample of the models.\n\nWe tested the assumptions and inputs used in the ECL models with the support of our internal modelling and economic specialists. In particular, we challenged the correlation and impact of the macroeconomic factors to the ECL and independently recalculated critical components of the ECL. In addition, we assessed the base and alternative economic scenarios, including challenging probability weights and comparing to other scenarios from a variety of external sources, as well as EY internally developed forecasts.\n\nWe challenged the criteria used to allocate an asset to stage 1, 2 and 3 in accordance with IFRS 9 and substantively reperformed in full the staging calculation to ensure that assets in stages 1, 2, and 3 were allocated to the appropriate stage. We also performed sensitivity analysis on the staging criteria.\n\nWe challenged management over the appropriateness and completeness or PMAs using our knowledge and experience across the industry. We performed testing over material PMAs together with our internal modelling specialists. We undertook analysis and benchmarking to assess whether sufficient consideration was given to the uncertainty arising as a result of inflationary and interest rate pressures on borrowers, which may not be captured in modelled outputs given limitations over historic data.\n\nWe communicated that we were satisfied that the provisions for impairment of loans and advances to customers were reasonable and recognised in compliance with the requirements of IFRS 9.\n\nOur testing of staging allocation, models and model assumptions identified no significant matters.\n\nWe communicated that the economic scenarios used, the weightings applied to scenarios, and the utilisation of PMAs to capture the risk of factors such as interest rate risk and inflation were reasonable. Other PMAs recorded by management were considered to be appropriate and complete.\n\nWe communicated that the considerations made by management in these areas meant that the ECL was reasonably stated.\n\nWe communicated that we were satisfied with the accuracy and adequacy of the disclosures made.",

We tested the compensating controls where appropriate.\n\nAccounting and reporting for the group's phased withdrawal from core banking is a new key audit matter in the current year because this has involved significant auditor judgement. Our evaluation of the directors' going concern assessment has required an increased level of auditor attention and therefore is also a new key audit matter in the current year.\n\n## Our application of materiality\n\nWe apply the concept of materiality in planning and performing the audit, in evaluating the effect of identified misstatements on the audit and in forming our audit opinion.\n\n## Materiality\n\nThe magnitude of an omission or misstatement that, individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of the users of the financial statements. Materiality provides a basis for determining the nature and extent of our audit procedures.\n\nWe determined materiality for the group to be \u00a36m (2023: \u00a36.2m) which is 0.8% of equity (2023: 1.5% of gross margin). We believe that equity provides us with the most appropriate basis for materiality, given the importance to the group of continuing to meet regulatory capital requirements as it undertakes a phased withdrawal from its core banking business over time. This represents a change from gross margin as the materiality basis in prior year, given the focus on capital adequacy over the withdrawal period. Revised materiality calculations undertaken on a basis of 1% equity would have led to increased materiality thresholds; however we did not consider it appropriate to raise materiality levels. As a result, materiality was capped broadly at the levels previously calculated amounts at 1.5% of gross margin, which results in 0.8% of equity.\n\nWe determined materiality for the Parent Company to be \u00a33.7m (2023: \u00a34.3m), which is 0.5% of equity (2023: 1.5% of gross margin). This basis is consistent with the basis used for materiality of the group financial statements.\n\n## Performance materiality\n\nThe application of materiality at the individual account or balance level. It is set at an amount to reduce to an appropriately low level the probability that the aggregate of uncorrected and undetected misstatements exceeds materiality.\n\nOn the basis of our risk assessments, together with our assessment of the group's overall control environment, our judgement was that performance materiality was 75% of our planning materiality, namely \u00a34.5m. We have set performance materiality at this percentage due to a limited history of misstatements or significant control deficiencies.\n\n## Reporting threshold\n\nAn amount below which identified misstatements are considered as being clearly trivial.\n\nWe agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them all uncorrected audit differences in excess of \u00a30.3m which is set at 5% of planning materiality, as well as differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.\n\nWe evaluate any uncorrected misstatements against both the quantitative measures of materiality discussed above and in light of other relevant qualitative considerations in forming our opinion.",

        "page_content": "## Other information\n\nThe other information comprises the information included in the annual report [set out on pages 2 to 42, 134 and 135], other than the financial statements and our auditor's report thereon. The directors are responsible for the other information contained within the annual report. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in this report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nOur responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the course of the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine whether this gives rise to a material misstatement in the financial statements themselves. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of the other information, we are required to report that fact.\n\nWe have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n## Opinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006\n\nIn our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:\n\n- \u00b7 the information given in the strategic report and the directors' report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and\n- \u00b7 the strategic report and directors' report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.\n\n## Matters on which we are required to report by exception\n\nIn the light of the knowledge and understanding of the group and the parent company and its environment obtained in the course of the audit, we have not identified material misstatements in the strategic report or the directors' report.\n\nWe have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, in our opinion:\n\n- \u00b7 adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from branches not visited by us; or\n- \u00b7 the parent company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or\n- \u00b7 certain disclosures of directors' remuneration specified by law are not made; or\n- \u00b7 we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.\n\n## Responsibilities of directors\n\nAs explained more fully in the directors' responsibilities statement set out on page 42, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the group and parent company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the group or the parent company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\n## Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements\n\nOur  objectives  are  to  obtain  reasonable  assurance  about  whether  the  financial  statements  as  a  whole  are  free  from  material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level  of  assurance,  but  is  not  a  guarantee  that  an  audit  conducted  in  accordance  with  ISAs  (UK)  will  always  detect  a  material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\n## Explanation as to what extent the audit was considered capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud\n\nIrregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design procedures in line with our responsibilities, outlined above, to detect irregularities, including fraud. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement due to fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting one resulting from error, as fraud may involve deliberate concealment by, for example, forgery or",

        "page_content": "intentional  misrepresentations,  or  through  collusion.  The  extent  to  which  our  procedures  are  capable  of  detecting  irregularities, including fraud is detailed below.\n\nHowever, the primary responsibility for the prevention and detection of fraud rests with both those charged with governance of the company and management.\n\n- \u00b7 We obtained an understanding of the legal and regulatory frameworks that are applicable to the group and determined that the most significant are the regulations, licence conditions and supervisory requirements of the Prudential  Regulation Authority (PRA) and the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and the Companies Act 2006.\n- \u00b7 We understood how Sainsbury's Bank plc is complying with those frameworks making inquiries of management, internal audit, and those responsible for legal and compliance matters. We also performed review of regulatory correspondence and reviewed minutes of the Board and Board Risk Committee meetings held. We gained an understanding of the Bank's approach to governance demonstrated by the Board's enterprise risk management framework ('ERMF') and internal control processes. We also reviewed the Bank's complaints and Whistleblowing processes.\n- \u00b7 We assessed the susceptibility of the group's financial statements to material misstatement, including how fraud might occur by assessing the controls that have established to address risks of fraud identified by the Bank, or that otherwise seek to prevent, deter, or detect fraud. We also considered performance and incentive plan targets and their potential to influence management to manage financial results.\n- \u00b7 Based on this understanding we designed our audit procedures to identify non-compliance with such laws and regulations. Our procedures involved inquiries of legal counsel, executive management, internal audit, and performed procedures over the risk of management override of internal control. We also focused our audit procedures on areas identified as higher risk as referred to in the key audit matters section of this report.\n- \u00b7 The Bank operates in the financial services industry which is a highly regulated environment. As such, the Senior Statutory Auditor considered the experience and expertise of the engagement team to ensure that the team had the appropriate competence and capabilities, which included the use of specialists where appropriate.\n\nA further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the\n\nFinancial Reporting Council's website at https://www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditor's report.\n\n## Other matters we are required to address\n\n- \u00b7 Following the recommendation from the audit committee we were appointed by the company on 16 August 2017 to audit the financial statements for the year ending 28 February 2018 and subsequent financial periods.\n- The period of total uninterrupted engagement including previous renewals and reappointments is 7 years, covering the years ending 28 February 2018 to 29 February 2024.\n- \u00b7 The non-audit services prohibited by the FRC's Ethical Standard were not provided to the group or the parent company and we remain independent of the group and the parent company in conducting the audit.\n- \u00b7 The audit opinion is consistent with the additional report to the audit committee.\n\n## Use of our report\n\nThis report is made solely to the company's members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company's members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor's report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the company and the company's members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.\n\nBlake Adlem (Senior statutory auditor) for and on behalf of Ernst & Young LLP, Statutory Auditor Edinburgh 24 April 2024",

Basis of Preparation\n\nThe Sainsbury's Bank consolidated financial statements represent the year ended 29 February 2024 and incorporate the financial statements of the Bank and the entities it controls. These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with UK-adopted international accounting standards.\n\nThe Group provides a range of retail banking services and related financial services wholly within the UK.\n\nThe financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention as modified for the revaluation of financial assets and liabilities (including derivative instruments) held at fair value through profit and loss and fair value through other comprehensive income. The principal accounting policies have been applied consistently throughout the year.\n\nThe Group has elected to take the exemption under section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 and therefore does not present the income statement and statement of comprehensive income of the Bank on a standalone basis.\n\nThe financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. The Directors have considered the appropriateness of the going concern basis of preparation of the financial statements, taking into account the Group's current and projected performance, with specific additional consideration given to the impacts of the strategic changes to the business as described in the Strategic Report on page 3. The strategy change introduces new or amended risks in respect of capital and liquidity adequacy as well as a change as regards the manner in which future trade of the Group is undertaken. There is no intention to cease trading, as outlined in the commitment to continue the provision of financial services via a distributed model. The assessment period for the purposes of considering going concern is the 12 months to 24 April 2025, however, in accordance with IAS 1, the Directors have also considered factors beyond this timeframe where longer term financial and operational forecasts and scenarios have been prepared.\n\nThe strategy change introduces new or amended risks in respect of liquidity and capital adequacy which arise from the move to offer financial services products by dedicated financial services providers and the phased withdrawal from the core banking business. Taking into account the current and forecast levels of liquidity and capital together with the related headroom, the Directors have considered and assessed the potential impact of the strategic change and the risks arising thereon. The evaluation has included the quantification of any potentially adverse impacts of customer behaviour as well as the timing of repayment of external funding. Having undertaken this assessment, the Directors are satisfied that the Group  has sufficient liquidity and capital resources to withstand severe but plausible adverse scenarios stemming from the risks of the strategic change prior to any additional mitigating actions being taken. In the event of any mitigations being required, the Directors are confident that additional liquidity could be raised through future asset securitisations or other sources of funding. Accordingly, it has been concluded that this does not result in any material uncertainties affecting the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. The Directors are also comfortable that, as at the date of approval of these financial statements, none of the scenarios considered result in the legal entity ceasing to trade.\n\nConsequently, the going concern basis continues to be appropriate in preparing the financial statements.\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also requires management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Group's accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the financial statements are disclosed in note 2.\n\nThe risk management framework as described in the strategic report on page 29 is considered adequate in managing liquidity and other key risks in the current environment including managing the elevated risks post the change in strategy. The Group continues to maintain its strong capital and liquidity position and has also been subject to review and challenge by the PRA as part of its remit as lead regulator of the Group. Further information on the key financial risks of the business can be found in note 33.\n\nThe Bank is a wholly-owned subsidiary of J Sainsbury plc and the Group results are included in the consolidated financial statements of J Sainsbury plc which are publicly available.\n\n## Foreign currencies\n\nThe Bank and Consolidated financial statements are presented in sterling which is the Group's functional and presentation currency. Foreign currency transactions are translated into sterling at the exchange rate prevailing at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities are translated at financial position date exchange rates. Exchange differences arising are recognised in the income statement.",

Basis of Preparation (continued)\n\n## Classification and measurement of financial instruments\n\nThe Group classifies all of its financial assets based on the business model for managing the assets and the assets' contractual terms, measured at either:\n\n- -Amortised cost,\n- -Fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI), or\n- -Fair value through profit and loss (FVPL)\n\nTo determine their classification and measurement category, IFRS 9 requires all financial assets, except equity instruments and derivatives, to be assessed based on a combination of the entity's business model for managing the assets and the instruments' contractual cash flow characteristics.\n\nThe business model assessment reflects how the Group manages the risks relating to the underlying financial assets, including whether the Group's principal objective is to collect the contractual cashflows arising from the instruments (amortised cost), to sell the financial instruments (FVPL) or a combination thereof (FVOCI).\n\nThe Group's business model is not assessed on an instrument-by-instrument basis, but at a higher level of aggregated portfolios and is based on observable factors such as how performance is reported to the entity's key management personnel, the way that risks are managed, how managers of the business are compensated and the expected frequency, value and timing of sales are also important aspects of the Group's assessment. In light of the recent strategic change regarding the Group moving to a distributed provision of financial services, the Group has considered whether any changes to the business model assessment exist under IFRS 9 and have concluded there has been no change at the 29 February 2024, meaning the Group's business model continues to be collection of contractual cashflows.\n\nThe business model assessment is based on reasonably expected scenarios without taking 'worst case' or 'stress case' scenarios into account. If cash flows after initial recognition are realised in a way that is different from the Group's original expectations, the Group does not change the classification of the remaining financial assets held in that business model but incorporates such information when assessing newly originated or newly purchased financial assets going forward.\n\nAs a second step of its classification process, where the business model involves the collection of contractual cashflows, the Group assesses the contractual cashflow characteristics of financial assets to identify whether they can be considered solely payments of principal and interest (the SPPI test).\n\n## Amortised cost\n\nFinancial assets that are principally held for the collection of contractual cashflows which pass the SPPI test are classified as amortised cost. Initial recognition is at fair value and subsequent measurement is at amortised cost, using the effective interest rate method, less provision for impairment as described in the impairment section below.\n\n## Fair value through other comprehensive income\n\nFinancial assets that are held for both the purpose of collecting contractual cashflows and to sell which pass the SPPI test are classified as FVOCI. Initial recognition and subsequent measurement are at fair value, with movements in fair value being recognised through OCI. Interest income is measured using the effective interest rate method and impairment gains and losses are recognised in the income statement.\n\n## Fair value through profit and loss\n\nFinancial assets that do not meet amortised cost or FVOCI criteria are classified as FVPL.\n\n## Equity instruments\n\nUpon initial recognition, the Group occasionally elects to classify irrevocably some of its equity investments as equity instruments at FVOCI when they meet the definition of Equity under IAS 32 Financial instruments: Presentation and are not held for trading. Such classification is determined on an instrument-by-instrument basis. Gains and losses on these equity instruments are never recycled to profit or loss. Dividends are recognised in profit or loss as other operating income.\n\nWhere this election is not applied equity instruments are measured at FVPL.\n\n## Financial liabilities\n\nOther than derivative financial liabilities, all of the Group's financial liabilities are recognised at amortised cost. Derivatives are classified as FVPL.\n\n## Basis of consolidation\n\nThe consolidated financial statements of the Group comprise the financial statements of the Bank and all consolidated subsidiaries.",

Basis of Preparation (continued)\n\n## Subsidiaries\n\nSubsidiaries are all entities, including special purpose entities, over which the Group has control. This is when the Group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. The results of subsidiaries are included in the income statement from the date of acquisition or, in the case of disposals, up to  the  effective  date  of  disposal.  Intercompany  transactions  and  balances  between  Group  companies  are  eliminated  upon consolidation.\n\nThe consolidated subsidiaries of the Bank are as follows:\n\n- - Home Retail Group Card Services Limited\n- - Home Retail Group Insurance Services Limited\n- - ARG Personal Loans Limited\n- - Drury Lane Funding 2020-1 plc\n\nArgos Personal Loans Limited has an active proposal to strike off the register at Companies House.\n\n## Standards and interpretations effective for the Company in these financial statements:\n\nNo new standards or interpretations became effective in the period or in the prior year that have a material impact on the Group.\n\n## Standards and interpretations effective for the Company in future periods:\n\nNo new standards, issued by the IASB but not yet effective, are expected to have a material impact on the Group's financial statements in future periods.\n\n## 2. Material accounting policies and judgements\n\nThe preparation of the financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, most critically in respect of impairment losses on loans and advances, capitalisation of intangible assets, effective yield and onerous provisions.\n\nJudgements and estimates are evaluated regularly and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Any revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.\n\nAll accounting policies material to the Group's financial statements are included within each respective line item's disclosure note. Accounting policies relating to immaterial transactions, events or conditions are themselves immaterial and therefore not disclosed.\n\nIn assessing the Group's judgements and sources of estimation uncertainty, consideration has been given to the impact of climate change risk on these. Climate change risks do not have any impacts on the Group's judgements or sources of estimation uncertainty.\n\nConsideration has also been given to the judgements and estimates arising from the announcement that financial services products to be offered in the future will be provided by dedicated financial services providers through a distributed model and over time this will result in a phased withdrawal from the core banking business.\n\nKey judgements have included the classification of costs as non-underlying items (Note 9), provisioning including the introduction of an Onerous Contracts Provision (Note 29) and management forecasts of future performance used to determine impairments and probability weighting on related cash flow projections to support such charges. In this regard two scenarios were considered to represent the range of possible outcomes as the Group implements the revised strategy, one comprising a sale of certain portfolios and the other a run down of certain portfolios over time (Notes 15 and 33).\n\n## Impairment of loans and advances\n\nImpairment loss models involve the estimation of future cash flows of financial assets, based on observable data at the financial position date and historical loss experience for assets with similar credit risk characteristics. This will typically take into account the level of arrears, security, past loss experience and default levels.\n\nThese  calculations  are  undertaken  on  a  portfolio  basis  using  various  statistical  modelling  techniques.  Impairment  models  are continually reviewed to ensure data and assumptions are appropriate with the most material assumption being around expected loss rates.\n\nThe Group has an Independent Model Oversight function who periodically validate the performance of IFRS 9 models including methodology and predictive accuracy. Monitoring is undertaken at Model Risk Committee (MRC) on a monthly basis with actions put in place to remediate any deficiencies.\n\nSainsbury's Bank plc Annual Report and Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 29 February 2024",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the financial statements (continued)\n\n## 2. Material accounting policies and judgements (continued)\n\n## Significant increase in credit risk (SICR)\n\nThe Group determines whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk by reference to quantitative thresholds, qualitative indicators and has also chosen to adopt the rebuttable backstop presumption that credit risk has significantly increased if contractual payments are more than 30 days past due.\n\nQuantitative thresholds have been determined that when the PD of an instrument as at the reporting date has increased to greater than a specified multiple of the origination PD, a significant increase in credit risk is deemed to have occurred. Qualitative tests are based around selective credit origination policy rules. In addition to variable risk appetite metrics, certain rules are in place at account origination for Loans and Credit Cards in order to decline accounts that may demonstrate factors outside of risk appetite that are not yet reflected in PD. At the reporting date, if an account satisfies any of these policy decline rules that it had not at the point of origination, it will be considered to have significantly increased in credit risk.\n\nThere is no probationary period applied in respect of accounts that cure from stage 2 to stage 1. Transfer criteria have been subject to extensive analysis to ensure that they appropriately reflect the flow of accounts from origination to default so as to maximise the number of accounts that flow through the stages and minimise accounts that jump directly from stage 1 to stage 3, or that fail to enter stage 3 from stage 2.\n\nThe Group has applied the low credit risk exemption in respect of its high-quality treasury portfolio held for liquidity purposes. This exemption permits low credit risk loans (i.e. those considered investment grade) to remain in stage 1 without an assessment of significant increase in credit risk.\n\n## Definition of default\n\nThe Group's definition of default is used in determining those accounts classified as stage 3 (i.e. credit impaired). The Group has chosen not to rebut the backstop presumption prescribed by IFRS 9 that where an account is 90 days or more past its due date then default has occurred.\n\nThe Group has also defined a number of unlikeliness to pay criteria that result in an account being deemed to have defaulted.  These include:\n\n- \u00b7 Where operational collections activities have been exhausted on accounts that are less than 90 days past due and the account is subject to recoveries processes\n- \u00b7 If any forbearance has been granted on the account\n- \u00b7 Where the customer is subject to insolvency proceedings\n- \u00b7 Where the customer is deceased\n\nWhere an account no longer meets any of the default criteria, such as by bringing payments back up to date, the Group will continue to consider the account as being in default for the  probation  period  (24 months  for Loans and Credit  Cards, and  12 months for Storecards) from the date when it last met the definition of default.\n\n## IFRS 9 staging and management of credit risk\n\nThe Group's staging criteria as outlined above is used to monitor credit risk performance at various management forums, and boardlevel governance including Audit Committee and Board Risk Committee. Key metrics such as coverage ratio and proportion of balances in each stage are monitored for directional movements, albeit there are no explicit risk appetite thresholds in this area.\n\n## Write off\n\nLoans and advances to customers are written off (either partially or in full) when there is no realistic prospect of recovery. This is generally the case when the Group determines that the borrower does not have assets or sources of income that could generate sufficient cash flows to repay the amounts subject to write off. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off result in impairment gains recorded in the income statement.\n\n## Expected lifetime\n\nFor the purposes of considering the lifetime probability of default, the expected lifetime of a financial asset is the contractual term where this is fixed within the contract, or in the case of revolving products such as credit cards a behavioural life is determined by reference to historic trends.",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the financial statements (continued)\n\n## 2. Material accounting policies and judgements (continued)\n\n## Portfolios\n\nThe Group calculates its ECL on a portfolio-based approach (collective assessment). The different portfolios the Group has are Loans, Credit  Cards,  AFS  Storecards  and  AFS  Monthly  Payment  Plan  (MPP).  The  products  within  the  different  portfolios  share  key characteristics such as term, interest rate, repayment expectations and operational processes which drive related assumptions within ECL models.\n\n## Modified financial assets\n\nWhen the contractual cash flows of a financial asset have been renegotiated or modified and the financial asset was not derecognised, its gross carrying amount is recalculated as the present value of the modified contractual cash flows,  discounted at the original effective interest rate with a gain or loss recognised in the income statement. In practice the renegotiation of lending is linked to an impairment event (forbearance) and any related gains or losses are reflected in the impairment charge recognised in the income statement.\n\n## Overlays and Post model adjustments (PMAs)\n\nOverlays and PMAs are short-term increases or decreases to the ECL at either a customer or portfolio level to account for items that have not been fully reflected in the existing models. Consistent with the most recent recommendations of the Taskforce on Disclosures about Expected Credit Losses (DECL), the Group has defined overlays as adjustments made outside of the granular account level ECL calculation and PMAs as being calculated at granular account level, most often in respect of known data or model limitations.\n\nInternal governance is in place to approve and monitor overlays and PMAs regularly and to reduce the reliance on them through model recalibration or redevelopment, as appropriate.\n\nOverlays and PMAs applied in estimating the reported ECL at 29 February 2024 are set out in the following table. The table includes adjustments in relation to data and model limitations. It shows the adjustments applicable to the scenario-weighted ECL numbers.\n\n2\n\n|                   | The Group   | The Group   | The Bank   | The Bank   |\n|-------------------|-------------|-------------|------------|------------|\n|                   | 2024  \u00a3m    | 2023  \u00a3m    | 2024  \u00a3m   | 2023  \u00a3m   |\n| Economic overlays | 2           | 1           | 2          |            |\n| Operational PMAs  | (1)         | (4)         | (13)       | (16)       |\n| Total             | 1           | (3)         | (11)       | (14)       |\n\nThe proportion of net overlays and PMAs for the Group is 1% of the total ECL provision at 29 February 2024 (2023: -1%).\n\nEconomic overlays are  included where management judge the underlying models do not respond adequately to the economic scenarios. The key economic uncertainty is the threat from interest rates as the models have been built using data from the recent historic low period for interest rates and do not adequately respond to the current economic forecasts in a higher rate environment and therefore hold a post model adjustment.\n\nThe majority of the operational PMAs relate to specific model limitations that have been manually corrected whilst a permanent fix is being developed. These are driving the majority of the year on year movement in operational PMAs as model fixes have been promoted into live. Additionally, we include a PMA for VAT recoverable via Bad Debt Relief where the debt arose as a consequence of sales in Sainsbury's or Argos.\n\nFor all PMAs there will always be an attempt to use existing IFRS 9 models as a base and amend assumptions and methodology as required to determine the level of impact a specific change would make. This change in ECL is recognised as a PMA until such time as those changes are implemented into production and the PMA can be removed.\n\n## Management use of ECL information\n\nECL forecasts and sensitivities are used in assessing the expected returns on different forms of lending and forms part of the assessment of whether lending should be offered. Default rates for certain subgroups within a portfolio drive forecasts and estimates when investigating the risks of lending changes within that portfolio.\n\nECL information is a key driver of financial performance and key performance drivers are regularly included in internal financial reporting. Where relevant, plausible alternative scenarios and assumptions will be presented as sensitivities to the current position or forecast to enable informed decisions on lending and provisioning to be made.\n\n## Macro-economic scenarios\n\nIFRS 9 requires that the measurement of ECL should reflect an unbiased and probability weighted amount that is determined by evaluating a range of forward-looking economic assumptions. The Group has engaged an external supplier to provide economic forecasts which are subject to review, challenge and approval through the Group's governance processes.\n\nSainsbury's Bank plc Annual Report and Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 29 February 2024",

Material accounting policies and judgements (continued)\n\nThe ECL models utilise 4 scenarios (2023: 4 scenarios) including a 'base case' scenario considered to be the most likely outcome together with an upside, downside and severe downside scenario. The base case has been assigned a probability weighting of 40% with the upside, downside and severe downside scenarios weighted 30%, 25% and 5% respectively (2023: base scenario 40%, upside, downside and severe downside scenarios were 30%, 25% and 5% respectively).\n\nEach portfolio, when modelled for IFRS9, showed different characteristics with predictive tendencies and this is the key driver for using different economic variables across portfolios. Unsecured products place greater weighting on unemployment rates, GDP and inflation.\n\nApproval and governance of the Group scenarios is via RCRC & ALCo, with ALCo approving the appropriate scenario weightings to be applied to ensure the most appropriate reflection of our views on future variables, such as unemployment and CPI rates.\n\nBeyond the 5-year forecast period, forecast economic variables are assumed to revert to long term averages, with the exception of unemployment which is expected to experience a gradual return to 4% by 2030. They are applied in ECL models for the remaining residual behavioural life of the related financial instruments, which can also exceed 5 years.\n\nThe graphs below plot the data for Unemployment, GDP, Consumer price growth and mortgage debt as a percentage of household income for each of the 4 scenarios used in our IFRS 9 models:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe most material economic variables to the calculation of ECL are unemployment and GDP.\n\nOur base case scenario envisages a peak unemployment 4.6% in Q2 2024 before reverting to the long-term average in Q4 2030 and a spike in CPI of 3.4% in the first quarter of 2024.\n\nThe key macro-economic assumptions included in the ECL calculation have also been summarised in the table below (shown as 5-year averages from the reporting date).",

Material accounting policies and judgements (continued)\n\n## Capitalisation and carrying value of intangible assets\n\nCapitalisation of intangible assets involves an assessment as to the appropriateness of costs that meet the qualifying criteria of IAS 38.\n\nIntangible assets are assessed to ensure they continue to meet the criteria of IAS 38, and for indicators of impairment, at each balance sheet date or more frequently where required by changes in circumstances.\n\nWhere impairments are indicated, the carrying values of fixed assets are written down by the amount of the impairment and the charge is recognised in profit or loss in the period in which it occurs. A previously recognised impairment charge on an intangible asset may be reversed in full or in part where a change in circumstances leads to a change in the estimates used to determine its recoverable amount.  The carrying value of the asset will only be increased to the carrying value at which it would have been  held had the impairment not been recognised.\n\nDetails of impairments recognised in the period including the approach undertaken and the Group's accounting policy are disclosed in notes 21 & 22.\n\n## Effective interest rate\n\nIn calculating the effective interest rate of a financial instrument, the Group takes into account all amounts that are integral to the yield of a financial instrument as well as incremental transaction costs. In the case of loans and advances to customers significant judgement is applied in estimating the effect of various factors, including future customer transactional and repayment behaviours, on future cash flows. As at 29 February 2024 the carrying value of the EIR asset was \u00a376m (2023: \u00a3108m). In the financial year, the Group recognised a \u00a321m reduction resulting from the strategic change impacting assumptions about future behaviours.\n\nEstimates are based on historical experience from similar product types. Management considers that the most material judgements are the post promotional yield and the repayment rate on the Bank's credit card portfolio.\n\nTo the extent that post promotional yield were to shift by +/- 100bps, the value of EIR asset would change by +/- \u00a35m. To the extent that the repayment rate was to increase by +/-5% the value of the EIR asset would change by +/- \u00a33m.\n\n## Provisions for Onerous Contracts\n\nProvisions for onerous contracts are recognised in line with IAS 37 where the Group believes that the unavoidable costs of meeting or novating a contract exceed the economic benefits expected to be received under it. In assessing this the Group is required to use the best estimate of the benefits to be realised in respect of the contracts, as opposed to requiring a committed plan that renders contracts onerous. The unavoidable costs reflect the lower of the incremental costs of fulfilling the contract and any penalties arising from failure to fulfil it. Further detail can be found in Note 29.",

Net interest income\n\nAccounting\n\npolicy\n\nInterest income and expense in the income statement is determined using the effective interest rate method. This calculation takes into account all amounts that are integral to the yield as well as incremental transaction costs. The effective interest rate is the rate that discounts the expected future cash flows over the expected life of the financial instrument to the net carrying amount of the financial asset or liability at initial recognition.\n\nThe effective interest rate of a financial asset is calculated on initial recognition and is applied to the gross carrying amount of the asset. For financial assets that have become credit-impaired  subsequent to initial recognition, interest income is calculated by applying the effective interest rate to the amortised cost of the financial asset net of impairment. If the asset is no longer credit impaired, then the calculation of interest income reverts to the gross basis.\n\nInterest income calculated using the effective interest method presented in the  income  statement includes interest on financial assets and financial liabilities measured at amortised cost,  at  fair value through other comprehensive income and the effective portion of hedge accounting instruments. Interest expense presented in the statement of profit or loss includes financial liabilities measured at amortised cost and the effective portion of hedge accounting instruments for derivatives in a hedge accounting relationship.\n\nInterest income and expense on other financial assets and financial liabilities at FVPL are presented in fair value gains on financial instruments (see note 8).\n\nInterest expense on lease liabilities is included within Interest expense on customer accounts, deposits and borrowings.\n\n| The Group                                                            | 2024  \u00a3m   | 2023  \u00a3m  1   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|---------------|\n| Continuing operations                                                |            | Restated      |\n| Interest income calculated using the effective interest rate method: |            |               |\n| Interest income on financial assets measured at amortised cost       | 399        | 351           |\n| Interest income on financial assets measured at FVOCI                | 39         | 13            |\n| Interest income on derivatives                                       | 22         | 12            |\n| Interest receivable                                                  | 460        | 376           |\n| Interest expense on customer accounts, deposits and borrowings       | (179)      | (62)          |\n| Interest expense on subordinated liabilities                         | (13)       | (12)          |\n| Interest payable                                                     | (192)      | (74)          |\n| Net interest income                                                  | 268        | 302           |",

Non-underlying items\n\nIn order to provide shareholders with additional insight into the year-on-year performance of the business, underlying profit measures are provided to supplement the reported IFRS numbers and reflect how the business measures performance internally. These adjusted measures exclude items recognised in reported profit, which, if included, could distort comparability between periods.\n\nDetermining which items are to be adjusted requires judgement, in which the Group considers items which are significant either by virtue of their size and/or nature, or that are non-recurring in that they do not relate to the ongoing business. The same assessment is applied consistently to any reversals of prior non-underlying items.  Underlying profit is not defined by IFRS and therefore may not be directly comparable with the 'adjusted' profit measures of other companies.\n\n## Strategic review of the financial services division\n\nIn January 2024, J Sainsbury plc announced that financial services products to be offered in the future will be provided by dedicated financial services providers through a distributed model and over time this would result in a phased withdrawal from the core banking business. Costs associated with this restructuring are set out in the table below with key components comprising full impairment of non-financial assets (comprising mainly computer software for which the level of activities which it was designed to fulfil is now significantly curtailed in terms of both volume and period use), additional allowances arising from a reassessment of the effective interest rate applied to the amortised cost of financial assets and onerous contracts. Further costs associated with this restructuring will be incurred in future years once more detailed plans to execute these changes are formulated and communicated.\n\n## Disposal of the mortgage portfolio\n\nDuring the period, the Group disposed of its mortgage portfolio for proceeds of \u00a3445m which resulted in a non-underlying charge of \u00a37m. This includes a loss on disposal including transaction costs of \u00a34m and the recognition of onerous contract provisions.\n\n## Other strategic initiatives\n\nIn the year to 29 February 2024, as in the year to 28 February 2023, costs relating to strategic initiatives reflect one-off projects to simplify the business and drive efficiencies and predominantly comprise consultancy costs.\n\n## Analysis of non-underlying items\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n1\n\n| The Group                                                                               |    | 2023  \u00a3m   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----|------------|\n| Strategic review of the financial services division                                     |    |            |\n| Impairment of non-financial assets                                                      |    |            |\n| Effective interest rate adjustment applied to financial assets                          | a) |            |\n| Onerous contracts                                                                       | b) |            |\n| Other costs                                                                             |    |            |\n| Income from other group companies                                                       |    |            |\n| Disposal of the mortgage portfolio                                                      |    |            |\n| Provisions                                                                              |    | (3)        |\n|                                                                                         |    | (3)        |\n| Other strategic initiatives                                                             |    |            |\n| Fair value (loss) / gain on hedge ineffectiveness of derivatives in hedge  relationship |    |            |\n| Total non-underlying items                                                              |    | (5)        |",

Taxation\n\n## Accounting policy\n\nTaxation on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax.\n\nCurrent tax is accounted for on the basis of tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. Current tax is charged or credited to the income statement, except when it relates to items charged to equity or other comprehensive income.\n\nDeferred tax is accounted for on the basis of temporary differences arising from differences between the tax base and accounting base of assets and liabilities.\n\nDeferred tax is recognised for all temporary differences, except to the extent where it arises from the initial recognition of an asset or a liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of transaction, affects neither accounting profit nor taxable profit. It is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred income tax liability is settled.\n\nDeferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset against each other when there is a legally enforceable right to set-off current taxation assets against current taxation liabilities and it is the intention to settle these on a net basis.\n\n| The Group Continuing operations                   | 2024  \u00a3m   | 2023  \u00a3m  Restated 1   |\n|---------------------------------------------------|------------|------------------------|\n| UK corporation tax on profit for the year         | (28)       | 3                      |\n| Adjustments in respect of prior years             | -          | (2)                    |\n| Current tax                                       | (28)       | 1                      |\n| Origination and reversal of temporary differences | (11)       | 2                      |\n| Adjustments in respect of prior years             | -          | 4                      |\n| Deferred tax                                      | (11)       | 6                      |\n| Total tax (credit) / charge                       | (39)       | 7                      |",

The change was enacted during the year ended 28 February 2022, with the corresponding revaluation of deferred tax taking place during that period.\n\nThe Spring Budget on 21 March 2023 confirmed the introduction of Pillar 2 reporting requirements for the UK, and were enacted on 18 July 2023, confirming that the rules will apply to Sainsburys Group for accounting periods starting on or after 31 December 2023.  Pillar 2 reporting will see the introduction of a global minimum 15 per cent tax rate by the end of 2023, and the Sainsbury's Group will be required to file certain returns evidencing the payment of tax at this rate. The potential impact of this has been assessed, and the Sainsbury's Group does not consider there to be a material top up tax liability at this stage, under the transitional safe harbour rules. Following this assessment, the Group does not consider there to be a significant impact on the Bank and its subsidiary undertakings.\n\nIt is unclear if the Pillar Two model rules create additional temporary differences, whether to remeasure deferred taxes and which tax rate to use to measure deferred taxes. The Group has therefore applied the mandatory temporary exception in the amended IAS 12 'Income taxes' from the requirement to recognise or disclose information about deferred tax assets and liabilities related to  the proposed Pillar Two model rules.\n\nDeferred income tax assets have been recognised in respect of all income tax losses and other temporary differences giving rise to deferred income tax assets because it is probable that these assets will be recovered. The Group expects to recover the majority of these assets by surrendering the underlying losses to other J Sainsbury plc group companies. In the year, the Bank surrendered losses to other J Sainsbury plc group companies, with \u00a34m tax value of losses surrendered to the Bank's subsidiary, Home Retail Group Card Services Limited and the remaining \u00a322m tax value of losses surrendered to other group companies outside of the Financial Services Segment.",

Loans and advances to customers\n\n## Accounting policy\n\nLoans and advances are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently held at amortised cost, using the effective  interest  method,  less  provision  for  impairment  and  recognised  on  the  balance  sheet  when  cash  is advanced.\n\nThe accounting policies for classification and measurement under IFRS are detailed in note 1.\n\n## Expected credit loss (ECL) impairment model\n\nIFRS 9 uses a 3 stage forward-looking expected credit loss (ECL) approach. IFRS 9 requires the Group to record an allowance for ECL for all loans and other debt financial assets not held at FVPL, together with loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts. The allowance is calculated by reference to the estimated probability of default (PD), exposure at default (EAD) and loss given default (LGD).\n\nThe probability of default represents the likelihood of a borrower defaulting either within 12 months from the balance sheet date or within the expected lifetime of the instrument.\n\nExposure at default represents the expected amount due from the borrower at the point of default by reference to exposure at the balance sheet date adjusted for expected future changes including repayments and utilisation of undrawn facilities.\n\nLoss given default represents the expected percentage loss at the point of default relative to the EAD. The estimate takes into account utilisation of any expected collections and recoveries strategies, debt sale arrangements and collateral.",

        "page_content": "## 15. Loans and advances to customers ( continued )\n\nThe 3 stage model to determine impairment allowance is summarised as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Stage 1 - Impairment allowance on financial assets that have not significantly increased in credit risk since origination, nor are credit impaired, is calculated using the probability that a borrower will default within 12 months from the balance sheet date. Interest income is recognised on the gross carrying value of the financial asset.\n- \u00b7 Stage 2 -  Where a financial asset exhibits a significant increase in credit risk (SICR) but is not yet considered to be credit impaired, the probability of default considered in the impairment allowance is based  upon  the  lifetime  probability  of  the  borrower  defaulting.  Interest  income  continues  to  be recognised on the gross carrying value of the financial asset.\n- \u00b7 Stage 3 - Assets considered to be credit impaired. One or more events has occurred that has resulted in a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of the asset. Stage 3 assets will continue to recognise lifetime expected impairment losses (with a 100% probability of default) and interest income will be recognised on the net carrying amount (i.e., gross amount less impairment allowance).\n\nIn determining ECL allowances, expected future recoveries are discounted to the reporting date at the original effective interest rate of the relevant instrument.\n\nA number of inputs and variables used in the ECL calculation are not defined within IFRS 9 and involve complex modelling and application of judgement as discussed in the remainder of this section. Further details on these critical accounting judgements can be found in note 2.\n\n## Undrawn commitments\n\nUndrawn loan, credit card and store-card commitments are commitments under which the Group is required to provide a loan with pre-specified terms to the customer. Under IFRS 9 these contracts are in scope of the ECL requirements.\n\nThe Group is required to estimate the extent to which undrawn commitments and facilities will be utilised by borrowers.\n\nThe nominal contractual value of these commitments, where the lending agreed to be provided is on market terms, are not recorded in the Balance Sheet. The ECLs in relation to undrawn commitments are disclosed in note 32. The impairment allowance in respect of these instruments is included within provisions for liabilities and charges as there is no related asset on balance sheet against which to offset the related impairment allowance.\n\nThe Group's gross lending exposure before deduction of impairment provisions is analysed below:\n\n|                                              | The Group   | The Group   | The Bank   | The Bank   |\n|----------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|------------|------------|\n|                                              | 2024  \u00a3m    | 2023  \u00a3m    | 2024  \u00a3m   | 2023  \u00a3m   |\n| Gross advances                               | 4,760       | 5,577       | 3,823      | 4,683      |\n| Impairment                                   | (235)       | (239)       | (149)      | (135)      |\n| Adjustment in relation to fair value hedging | (7)         | (45)        | 41         | 7          |\n| Loans and advances to customers              | 4,518       | 5,293       | 3,715      | 4,555      |\n| Gross advances being:                        |             |             |            |            |\n| Repayable on demand                          | 2,006       | 2,388       | 1,575      | 1,949      |\n| Other loans and advances repayable:          |             |             |            |            |\n| In 3 months or less                          | 535         | 531         | 200        | 222        |\n| Between 3 months and 1 year                  | 689         | 662         | 522        | 519        |\n| Between 1 and 5 years                        | 1,483       | 1,459       | 1,479      | 1,456      |\n| After 5 years                                | 47          | 537         | 47         | 537        |\n|                                              | 4,760       | 5,577       | 3,823      | 4,683      |\n\nSainsbury's Bank plc Annual Report and Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 29 February 2024",

Derivative financial instruments\n\n## Accounting\n\n## policy\n\nAll derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the contract date and are re-measured to their fair value at each subsequent reporting date. Changes in fair value of all derivative instruments are recognised immediately in the income statement. Fair values are obtained from observable market data before the application of appropriate discounting factors.\n\nWhere the overall carrying value of a derivative is positive it is held and classified on the balance sheet as an asset. Alternatively, when the overall carrying value of a derivative is negative it is held and classified as a liability.\n\nThe Group's policy is to use derivatives for economic purposes only, and not for trading. Where possible it will elect to  designate  the  derivative  into  an  effective  hedge  accounting  relationship,  where  the  gains  and  losses  on derivatives are offset by effective hedged item adjustments within the income statement.\n\n## Fair value hedging\n\nThe Group designates certain derivatives as fair value hedges where the derivative financial instrument hedges the change in fair value of the particular risks inherent in recognised assets or liabilities (fair value hedges).\n\nThe Group has adopted IFRS 9 hedge accounting requirements for fair value hedges of investment securities and its Fixed Rate Debt issuance. These instruments are hedged via plain vanilla interest rate swaps, with the critical economic terms of both the hedging instrument and hedged item matching. The notional amount, fixed interest legs and maturity dates are economically matched. The main source of ineffectiveness within the micro hedge relationships relates to the floating leg valuation changes inherent within the hedging instrument that do not exist within the hedged item.\n\nThe Group uses portfolio fair value hedging as a risk management tool for hedging interest rate risk on the personal loans and up to the point of disposal in August 2023, also the mortgage portfolio. Portfolio fair value hedging allows the designation of the whole or part of a portfolio of assets or liabilities with similar risk exposures. The hedged item can be designated based on expected maturities to match the hedging derivative maturity. Hedge effectiveness is considered to have been met where the change in fair value of the hedged item offsets the change in fair value of hedging instruments, within the 80 to 125 per cent ratio corridor.",

        "page_content": "## 19. Derivative financial instruments (continued)\n\nTo qualify for hedge accounting the Group documents at the inception of the hedge, the hedging risk management strategy, the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item or transaction and the nature of the risks being hedged. The Group also documents the assessment of the effectiveness of the hedging relationship, to show that the hedge is expected to be (prospectively) and, subsequently, has been (retrospectively) effective.\n\n## Derivatives not in a hedge accounting relationship\n\nThe Group's entire derivative portfolio is executed for economic purposes. Under IAS 39 rules, for macro portfolio hedging, some of the Group's hedging derivatives do not qualify, or prove too onerous, to be designated into an effective hedged relationship. In those instances, the interest rate swaps are viewed as trading derivatives under IFRS 9 with any movements in fair value recognised in the income statement, without offset.\n\n## Foreign currency derivative contracts\n\nForeign currency exposure arises from currency holdings within the Group's travel money business.\n\nThe Group enters into foreign exchange derivative contracts to hedge foreign currency exposure. Foreign exchange derivative instruments included FX spot, FX forwards and FX swaps. The Group reported a FX derivative asset of \u00a3nil (2023: \u00a3nil) and a FX derivative liability of \u00a3nil (2023: \u00a3nil).\n\n## Fair value hedges\n\nThe amounts relating to items designated as hedging instruments and hedge ineffectiveness were as follows.\n\n-\n\n-\n\n|                                                   | The Group   | The Group       | The Group       | The Group                  |\n|---------------------------------------------------|-------------|-----------------|-----------------|----------------------------|\n|                                                   |             | Carrying amount | Carrying amount |                            |\n|                                                   | Notional    |                 |                 | Ineffectiveness recognised |\n|                                                   | amount      | Assets          | Liabilities     | in income statement        |\n|                                                   | \u00a3m          | \u00a3m              | \u00a3m              | \u00a3m                         |\n| Interest rate swaps - Hedge of loans and advances |             |                 |                 |                            |\n| At 29 February 2024                               | 2,312       | 62              | (56)            |                            |\n| At 28 February 2023                               | 2,824       | 98              | (53)            |                            |\n\nFurther detail on the fair value of hedged item can be found in Notes 15 and 27.\n\n-\n\n-\n\n|                                                   | The Bank   | The Bank        | The Bank        | The Bank                   |\n|---------------------------------------------------|------------|-----------------|-----------------|----------------------------|\n|                                                   |            | Carrying amount | Carrying amount |                            |\n|                                                   | Notional   |                 |                 | Ineffectiveness recognised |\n|                                                   | amount     | Assets          | Liabilities     | in income statement        |\n|                                                   | \u00a3m         | \u00a3m              | \u00a3m              | \u00a3m                         |\n| Interest rate swaps - Hedge of loans and advances |            |                 |                 |                            |\n| At 29 February 2024                               | 1,765      | 15              | (56)            |                            |\n| At 28 February 2023                               | 2,203      | 46              | (53)            |                            |\n\nDerivatives not in fair value hedge accounting relationship are as follows:\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n|                       | Notional amount  \u00a3m   | Assets  \u00a3m   | Liabilities  \u00a3m   |\n|-----------------------|-----------------------|--------------|-------------------|\n| Interest rate swap    |                       |              |                   |\n| At 29 February 2024   | -                     | -            |                   |\n| At 28 February 2023   | 209                   | 1            |                   |\n| Foreign currency swap |                       |              |                   |\n| At 29 February 2024   | 45                    | -            |                   |\n| At 28 February 2023   | 14                    | -            |                   |",

Intangible assets\n\n## Accounting policy\n\nComputer Software\n\nComputer software is carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and any provision for impairment. Externally acquired software and licences are capitalised and amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful economic lives. Costs relating to development of computer software for internal use are capitalised once the recognition criteria of IAS 38 'Intangible Assets' are met. Other development expenditures that do not meet these criteria are recognised as an expense as incurred. When the software is available for its intended use, these costs are amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful economic lives being:\n\n- \u00b7 Core banking software - fifteen years\n- \u00b7 Other software - three to ten years\n\nCapitalised development expenditure and purchased software is stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. Such assets are assessed for impairment where there is an indication of impairment or, in the case of assets which are not yet available for use, at least annually. Where impairment exists, the carrying amount of the asset is reduced to its recoverable amount and the impairment loss recognised in the income statement. The amortisation charge for the asset is then adjusted to reflect the asset's revised carrying amount.\n\nCost includes the purchase price after deducting discounts and rebates, and other directly attributable costs of preparing the asset for its intended use.\n\nSubsequent expenditure is only capitalised when it increases the future economic benefits embodied in the specific asset to which it relates.",

Intangible assets (continued)\n\nAt each reporting date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is determined based on the fair value less cost to dispose and a value in use (VIU) calculation which is based upon the cash flows expected to be generated.\n\nAny impairment loss is recognised in the income statement in the year in which it occurs. Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses due to a change in the original estimate, the carrying amount of the asset is increased to  the  revised  estimate  of  its  recoverable  amount,  or  its  original  carrying  value  less  notional  accumulated depreciation if lower.\n\n-\n\n2\n\n|                                     | The Group   |          | The Bank   | 2023   |\n|-------------------------------------|-------------|----------|------------|--------|\n| The Group                           | 2024  \u00a3m    | 2023  \u00a3m | 2024 \u00a3m    | \u00a3m     |\n| Cost                                |             |          |            |        |\n| At 1 March                          | 378         | 361      | 339        | 330    |\n| Additions                           | 13          | 19       | 2          | 11     |\n| Disposals                           | (4)         | (2)      | (4)        | (2)    |\n| As at 29/28 February                | 387         | 378      | 337        | 339    |\n| Accumulated amortisation            |             |          |            |        |\n| At 1 March                          | (199)       | (170)    | (192)      | (168)  |\n| Charge for the year                 | (30)        | (31)     | (24)       | (26)   |\n| Impairment                          | (162)       | -        | (125)      |        |\n| Disposals                           | 4           | 2        | 4          |        |\n| As at 29/28 February                | (387)       | (199)    | (337)      | (192)  |\n| Net book value as at 29/28 February | -           | 179      | -          | 147    |\n\n## Impairment\n\n## Approach and identification of cash generating units (CGUs)\n\nA CGU is deemed to be each respective product or product group that is capable of generating cash flows independent of other products. Non-product assets are reviewed separately as corporate assets for the products that they support.\n\nThe Group have identified and assessed two individual CGUs, namely one for Sainsbury's Bank plc (SB CGU) and one for Home Retail Group Card Services Limited (HRGCS CGU). SB CGU comprises unsecured lending for Credit Cards and Personal Loans, funding from Savings, Treasury and AFS Intercompany, as well as ATMs, Travel Money, Insurances and legal entity specific central costs including overheads. Conversely the HRGCS CGU includes Storecards, Monthly Payment Plan and legal entity specific central costs including overheads.\n\n## Identification of a triggering event\n\nAs described in note 9, the Group's change in strategy to exit core banking and move to a fully distributed model was an indicator of impairment,  triggering  a  full  impairment  review.  This  review  was  undertaken  in  January  2024  with  related  impairment  being recognised  in  the  same  month.  No  further  indicators  of  impairment  or  reversal  of  impairment  have  been  identified  since  this impairment assessment was undertaken.",

These  scenarios  are  considered  appropriate  in  capturing  the  full  range  of  uncertain  outcomes  and  have  been  probability  weighted  in  determining  VIU.  The  cash  flows  included  are  consistent with the useful lives of the assets being tested for impairment. |\n| Terminal value        | No terminal value is applied within the assessment, as cashflows are limited to the period of the  remaining useful lives of the assets being tested for impairment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n| Discount rate         | A  post-tax  discount  rate  representing  the  Group's  weighted  average  cost  of  capital  (WACC),  subsequently grossed up to a pre-tax rate of 14.7 per cent.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |\n|                       | The post-tax WACC has been calculated using a combination of adjusted market analysis and the  actual cost of debt on Tier 2 capital instruments.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n| Growth Rate           | The only product with cash flow projections beyond the financial forecast period of the Group (driven  by the useful lives of the underlying assets)  was ATMs. ATM cashflows are assumed to shrink by 5%  annually beyond the forecast period as cash reliance expectations continue to fall.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n\n## Sensitivities\n\nThe Group has completed sensitivity analysis to consider reasonably possible changes in the above assumptions. The most material sensitivity is a change to the forecast cashflow assumptions. Impairment would only begin to be reversed if future product profitability were to increase by 73% for the SB CGU and 40% for the HRGCS CGU.\n\n## Capital Commitments\n\nAs a result of the full impairment of fixed assets, the Group is no longer intending to capitalise any expenditure and has therefore not disclosed any capital commitments in the current year.",

Property, plant & equipment\n\n## Accounting\n\n## policy\n\n## Land and buildings\n\nLand  and  buildings  are  stated  at  cost  less  accumulated  depreciation  and  any  recognised  provision  for impairment. Capital work in progress is held at cost less any recognised provision for impairment. Cost includes the original purchase price of the asset and the costs incurred attributable to bringing the asset to its working condition for intended use. This includes capitalised borrowing costs.\n\n## Fixtures and equipment\n\nFixtures and equipment, including tenant's improvements, are held at cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised provision for impairment. Cost includes the original purchase price of the asset and the costs attributable to bringing the asset to its working condition and its intended use.\n\n## Right of use assets\n\nRight of use assets obtained under a lease arrangement are included in the above categories as appropriate and depreciated as described below.\n\n## Depreciation\n\nDepreciation is calculated to write down the cost of the assets to their residual values, on a straight-line method over their useful economic life, on the following bases:\n\n- \u00b7 Freehold buildings and leasehold properties - fifty years, or the lease term if shorter\n- \u00b7 Fixtures and equipment - three to fifteen years or, in the case of tenant's improvements, the lease term if shorter\n\nCapital work in progress is not depreciated.\n\nGains and losses on disposal are determined by comparing proceeds with the asset's carrying amount and are recognised within operating profit. The assets' residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at the end of each reporting period.\n\nAt each reporting date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset, being the higher of its fair value less costs to dispose and its value in use, is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss.\n\n2\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n|                                       | The Group and Bank     | The Group and Bank          | The Group and Bank   |\n|---------------------------------------|------------------------|-----------------------------|----------------------|\n| 29 February 2024                      | Land and buildings  \u00a3m | Fixtures and  equipment  \u00a3m | Total \u00a3m             |\n| Cost                                  |                        |                             |                      |\n| At 1 March 2023                       | 9                      | 61                          | 70                   |\n| Additions                             | 1                      | 1                           |                      |\n| Disposals/Write off                   | -                      | -                           |                      |\n| As at 29 February 2024                | 10                     | 62                          | 72                   |\n| Accumulated depreciation              |                        |                             |                      |\n| At 1 March 2023                       | (8)                    | (53)                        | (61)                 |\n| Charge for the year                   | (1)                    | (1)                         | (2)                  |\n| Disposals/Write off                   | -                      | -                           |                      |\n| Impairment loss                       | (1)                    | (8)                         | (9)                  |\n| As at 29 February 2024                | (10)                   | (62)                        | (72)                 |\n| Net book value as at 29 February 2024 | -                      | -                           |                      |",

Where assets are dedicated to the fulfilment of a contract that cannot be redirected to other parts of the Group, an impairment charge is recognised to reduce the carrying value of the assets to \u00a3nil before recognising a separate onerous contract.",

It primarily relates to expected credit losses on credit card and store card commitments.\n\n## Onerous contact provisions\n\nThe onerous contract provision primarily relates to the strategic review of the business and the disposal of the mortgage business. The Group assessed all existing material supplier contracts recognising provisions where the unavoidable costs are greater than expected future benefits under both strategic initiatives as applicable.   The provision is determined by estimating future costs and economic benefits associated with the contracts and allocating other costs that directly relate to fulfilling the contracts.  The most judgemental aspect of the provision is the estimation of future economic benefits.  However, as the provision is calculated as the lower of the costs to fulfil the contract or the costs to exit the contract, it is not particularly sensitive to changes in the estimated economic benefits.",

Provisions for liabilities and charges (continued)\n\n## PPI customer remediation\n\nThe PPI customer remediation provision relates to the costs associated with potential redress from customers in respect of past sales of Payment Protection Insurance (PPI) policies. This liability sits with the Bank's subsidiary Home Retail Group Insurance Services Limited.\n\nThe FCA deadline for customers PPI claims through the complaints procedure passed on 29 August 2019. However, customers can continue to bring claims against firms through a legal route, claiming an Unfair Relationship under the Consumer Credit Act. The closing PPI provision of \u00a35m (2023: \u00a36m) represents the cost of future litigation claims and the associated costs, including solicitors' fees and the operational costs of processing claims. The provision represents management's best estimate of future costs and will remain under review. The eventual cost is dependent upon claim volumes, claim values and claim handling costs. These assumptions are inherently uncertain, and the ultimate financial impact may be different than the amount provided. The Group will continue to monitor the position and update its assumptions as more information becomes available.\n\n## Other provisions\n\nOther provisions relate to liabilities arising from dilapidations and onerous cost provisions associated with the Group's existing head office property in the current year (2023:  \u00a33m in respect of the New Bank Programme transition).\n\nWhere charges on  provisions are material and relate to a historic time periods, they are recognised outside of underlying profit in order to provide a clear and consistent view of the Group's underlying performance.\n\n## 30.

Risk management\n\nThe Group encounters a range of different risks and uncertainties as it undertakes its day-to-day activities and seeks to achieve its strategic objectives. Our approach to risk management and an overview of the Principal risk types are described in the Risk Overview section on page 29. Further detail on credit and liquidity risk exposures are shown below, with capital adequacy discussed further in note 34.\n\n## Credit risk\n\nCredit risk is central to the Group's day to day activities and is managed in line with the Board approved risk appetite as detailed within the Principal Risks section (page 33).\n\n## Retail credit risk\n\nRetail Credit Risk is the possibility of losses arising from a retail customer failing to meet their agreed repayment terms as they fall due. Retail Credit utilise automated scorecards to assess the credit worthiness and affordability criteria of new applicants and ongoing behavioural characteristics of existing customers. The outcome from all scorecard models is monitored utilising a set of credit quality metrics to ensure actual performance is in line with agreed expectations. Additional expert underwriting of credit applications is undertaken by a specialist operational team where further consideration is appropriate.\n\nThe Retail Credit Risk Committee provide portfolio oversight control over credit risk strategy to maintain lending in line with the Board approved risk appetite, with additional oversight and control provided by the Executive Risk Committee and Board Risk Committee. Internal Audit provide additional assurance by undertaking regular reviews on the adequacy of credit risk policies and procedures.\n\n## Wholesale and derivative credit risk\n\nThe Group's Treasury liquid assets portfolio is held primarily for liquidity management purposes and in the case of derivatives, for the purpose of managing market risk. The Treasury liquid assets portfolio is invested in eligible investment securities that qualify for the regulatory Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) and internal Operational Liquidity Pool (OLP). These investments include the Bank of England's  (BoE)  reserve  account,  UK  government  securities  (gilts  or  Treasury  bills),  multilateral  development  bank  securities, government guaranteed agency securities, covered bonds and asset backed securities.\n\nLimits are established for all counterparty and asset class exposures based on their respective credit quality and market liquidity. Consideration is also given to geographical region and the strength of relevant sovereign credit ratings.\n\nDerivatives are subject to the same credit risk control procedures as are applied to other wholesale market instruments and the credit risk arising from mark-to-market derivative valuations is mitigated by daily margin calls, posting cash collateral to cover exposures.",

Risk management (continued)\n\nDaily monitoring is undertaken by the Group's Treasury and Financial Risk teams, including early warning indicators with appropriate triggers for escalation . Oversight of the Group's Wholesale credit risk positions are included as part of ALCo.\n\nAt 29 February 2024, the maximum credit exposure of the Group in the event of other parties failing to perform their obligations is equal to the sum of loans and advances to customers, loans and advances to banks, investment securities and credit lines and  other commitments to lend. These are set out in notes 15, 18, 20 and 32 respectively. No account is taken of any collateral held and the maximum exposure to loss is considered to be the instrument's balance sheet carrying amount.\n\nThe table below shows the maximum exposure to credit risk for the components of the balance sheet, including derivatives.

Concentrations  indicate  the  relative  sensitivity  of  the  Group's performance to developments affecting a particular industry, counterparty, or geographical location.\n\nThe Group is a retail-focused financial institution operating solely in the UK. In line with its risk principles, the Group seeks to actively identify and manage risk concentrations across its business areas and activities. It has set clear targets for diversification within its asset and liability portfolios and sources of income. These are supported by a range of portfolio limits and a focus on key processes and controls across its activities, systems and supply chain.",

Retail credit risks are managed in accordance with limits set out within Board Risk appetite which is documented in detailed policies and policy standards. There were no significant changes noted in appetite over the period albeit credit risk strategies were reviewed. Most notably, affordability calculations were updated and reinforced to reflect the rising cost of living. Reviews of credit risk appetite levels are subject to annual review and more frequently if required. Credit strategy is updated within appetite, to reflect emerging trends and/or changes to appetite.\n\nWe have considered whether any new or emerging risks (as detailed in the Strategic report on page 31) result in an impact on our ECL provisions. The immediate impacts on inflation are considered as part of our provisions adequacy and have resulted in us holding an economic uncertainty overlay as outlined in note 2. To date climate risk has not resulted in any significant impact on our observed expected credit losses.\n\nFollowing  the  Group's  sale  of  the  mortgage  portfolio,  all  lending  is  unsecured  comprising  of  Personal  Loans,  Credit  Cards,  AFS Storecards and the Monthly Payment Plan.",

Forbearance is relief granted by a lender to assist customers in financial difficulty, through arrangements which temporarily allow the customer to pay an amount other than the contractual amounts due. These temporary arrangements may be initiated by the customer or the Group where financial difficulty would prevent repayment within the original terms and conditions of the contract. The main aim of forbearance is to support customers in returning to a position where they are able to meet their contractual obligations.\n\nThe Group has well defined forbearance policies and processes. A number of forbearance options are made available to customers. These include arrangements to repay arrears over a period of time, by making payments above the contractual amount, that ensure the loan is repaid within the original repayment term and short-term concessions, where the borrower is allowed to make reduced repayments (or in exceptional circumstances, no repayments) on a temporary basis to assist with short-term financial hardship.\n\nThe table below details the values of secured and unsecured advances that are subject to forbearance programmes.\n\n| The Group   | The Group    | The Group     | The Group   | The Group       | The Group        | The Group   |\n|-------------|--------------|---------------|-------------|-----------------|------------------|-------------|\n|             | 2024         | 2024          | 2024        | 2023            | 2023             | 2023        |\n|             | Gross loans  | Forbearance   | Forbearance | Gross loans and |                  | Forbearance |\n|             | and advances | as a total of | covered by  | advances        | Forbearance as   | covered by  |\n|             | subject to   | loans and     | impairment  | subject to      | a total of loans | impairment  |\n|             | forbearance  | advances      | provision   | forbearance     | and advances     | provision   |\n|             | \u00a3m           | %             | %           | \u00a3m              | %                | %           |\n| Unsecured   | 53           | 1.1           | 67.2        | 61              | 1.2              | 69.1        |\n\nThe Bank\n\n2024\n\n2023\n\nForbearance\n\nas a total of\n\nloans and\n\nadvances\n\nForbearance as\n\na total of loans\n\nand advances\n\nUnsecured\n\n38\n\n1.0\n\n65.9\n\n35\n\n0.9\n\n67.1\n\nGross loans\n\nand advances\n\nsubject to\n\nforbearance\n\n\u00a3m\n\n%\n\n%\n\n\u00a3m\n\n%\n\n%\n\nForbearance\n\ncovered by\n\nimpairment\n\nprovision\n\nGross loans and\n\nadvances\n\nsubject to\n\nforbearance\n\nForbearance\n\ncovered by\n\nimpairment\n\nprovision",

Risk management ( continued )\n\n## Climate-related credit risk\n\nOur assessment of climate-related credit risk is outlined in the emerging risks section on page 31. To date we have not seen and do not actively monitor any changes to the probability of default or loss given default that arise as a result of physical or transitional climate risk. Due to our predominantly unsecured portfolios, we do not anticipate material exposure to credit risks as a result of climate change over the next 5 years, however we continually monitor this assumption.\n\nGovernmental  and  societal  responses  to  climate  change  risks  are  still  developing,  and  are  interdependent  upon  each  other, consequently financial statements cannot capture all possible future outcomes as these are not yet known.\n\n## Debt securities, balances with central banks and other eligible investment securities\n\nThe total gross amount of individually impaired debt securities, cash and balances with central banks, UK government securities (Gilts and Treasury bills) and other eligible investment securities as at 29 February 2024 was \u00a3nil (2023: \u00a3nil). The tables below present an analysis of the credit quality of cash and cash equivalents and the treasury assets portfolio by market value.\n\n|                                          | The Group                                 | The Group                     | The Group                        | The Group   |\n|------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|----------------------------------|-------------|\n| At 29 February 2024                      | Cash and balances  with central banks  \u00a3m | UK government  securities  \u00a3m | Other investment  securities  \u00a3m | Total  \u00a3m   |\n| Aaa to A3                                | -                                         | -                             | 770                              | 770         |\n| ATM cash and balances with central banks | 1,051                                     | -                             | -                                | 1,051       |\n| Other demand deposits                    | 61                                        | -                             | -                                | 61          |\n|                                          | 1,112                                     | -                             | 770                              | 1,882       |\n\n|                                          | The Bank                                  | The Bank                      | The Bank                         | The Bank   |\n|------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|----------------------------------|------------|\n| At 29 February 2024                      | Cash and balances  with central banks  \u00a3m | UK government  securities  \u00a3m | Other investment  securities  \u00a3m | Total  \u00a3m  |\n| Aaa to A3                                | -                                         | -                             | 770                              | 770        |\n| ATM cash and balances with central banks | 1,051                                     | -                             | -                                | 1,051      |\n| Other demand deposits                    | 27                                        | -                             | -                                | 27         |\n|                                          | 1,078                                     | -                             | 770                              | 1,848      |\n\n|                                          | The Group                                 | The Group                     | The Group                        | The Group   |\n|------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|----------------------------------|-------------|\n| At 28 February 2023                      | Cash and balances  with central banks  \u00a3m | UK government  securities  \u00a3m | Other investment  securities  \u00a3m | Total  \u00a3m   |\n| Aaa to A3                                | -                                         | 25                            | 716                              | 741         |\n| ATM cash and balances with central banks | 471                                       | -                             | -                                | 471         |\n| Other demand deposits                    | 75                                        | -                             | -                                | 75          |\n|                                          | 546                                       | 25                            | 716                              | 1,287       |",

The Group's exposures are held with a central clearing counterparty, the London Clearing House (LCH), the terms of which also required an initial margin to be provided. At 29 February 2024, the Group had posted cash collateral of \u00a310m (2023: \u00a349m) and received cash collateral of \u00a366m (2023: \u00a352m) against its derivative positions, and posted \u00a316m of initial margin in the form of cash (2023: \u00a321m of initial margin collateralised by encumbered Gilts).",

Risk management ( continued )\n\n## Liquidity and funding risk\n\nLiquidity risk is the risk that the Group cannot meet its payment obligations as they fall due or can only do so at excessive cost. The Group seeks to ensure that financial obligations can be met at all times, even under liquidity stress conditions.\n\nThe annual ILAAP enables the Group to:\n\n- \u00b7 Identify and assess its most relevant liquidity risk drivers\n- \u00b7 Quantify its liquidity needs under various stress scenarios and\n- \u00b7 Put in place appropriate limits and controls to mitigate liquidity risks.\n\nIn meeting its internal limits as well as PRA requirements, the Group maintains a stock of high-quality liquid assets that can be readily monetised by outright sale or repurchase agreement to meet the Group's obligations to depositors and other creditors.\n\nThe Group's Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) and Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) are regularly monitored and forecast alongside net cash flows and key funding ratios. Treasury prepare long term and short-term forecasts to assess liquidity requirements, taking into account factors such as ATM cash management, contractual maturities, and customer deposit patterns (stable or less stable deposits) as well as outflows regarding undrawn commitments. These reports support daily liquidity risk management, with early warning indicators reviewed on a daily basis and appropriate triggers for escalation and action in line with risk appetite, Liquidity and Funding Risk Policy and Liquidity Contingency Plan (which is incorporated in the Recovery Plan). Asset encumbrance ratios and key risk indicators for wholesale funding are also regularly monitored and reported to ALCo.\n\nThe table below shows the undiscounted cash flows on the Group's financial assets, liabilities, and unrecognised loan commitments on  the  basis  of  their  earliest  possible  contractual  maturity.  The  expected  (behavioural)  cash  flows  on  these  instruments  vary significantly from this analysis and as such are regularly modelled to ensure operational net cash flows are managed. The disclosure for derivatives shows a gross inflow and outflow amount. As derivatives have a simultaneous net settlement it is not considered representative to show only the outflow amount.\n\nRepayments which are subject to notice are treated as if notice were to be given immediately. However, the Group expects that many customers will not request repayment on the earliest date the Group could be required to pay, and the table does not reflect the expected cash flows indicated by the Group's deposit retention history.",

Cash collateral is advanced and received as variation margin on derivatives transactions, whilst eligible treasury assets are pledged as collateral for initial margin requirements on derivatives which are centrally cleared. Eligible personal loans with applicable haircuts are used as collateral for the securitisation facility and the Bank of England's Term Funding Scheme with additional incentives for SMEs (TFSME) and Indexed Long-term Repo (ILTR). The personal loans used to secure the funding are held within Loans and advances to customers. There are assets which would not normally be considered available for encumbrance in the normal course of the Group's business including intangible assets, property, plant and equipment, prepayments and accruals and deferred tax assets. These are included within the carrying value of unencumbered assets.\n\n## Market risk\n\nMarket risk is the risk of loss as a result of the value of the Group's assets, liabilities and off-balance-sheet instruments being adversely affected by movements in market prices, interest rates or foreign exchange rates which leads to a reduction in either earnings or economic value. The key market risks are Interest Rate Risk in the Banking Book (IRRBB) and Foreign Exchange risk. The Bank does not have a trading book.\n\n## Interest Rate Risk in the Banking Book\n\nIRRBB is the current or prospective risk to both earnings and economic value from movements in interest rates. The main sub-types of IRRBB include:\n\n- -Re-pricing risk (or gap risk): the risk arising from timing differences in the interest rate changes of Bank assets and liabilities (e.g. fixed rate personal loans and instant access savings accounts).\n- -Yield curve risk: the risk arising from changes in the slope and shape of the yield curve.\n- -Basis risk: risk arising from imperfect correlation between different interest rate indices (e.g. administered rate on savings products and treasury assets linked to SONIA).\n- -Prepayment risk:  the  risk  arising  from  the  timing  of  customer  prepayments  which  differ  from  planning  and  hedging assumptions.\n- -Credit Spread Risk: the risk of adverse effects resulting from a change in credit spreads, arising via the Group's treasury assets portfolio.",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the financial statements (continued)\n\n## 33. Risk management ( continued )\n\n## Foreign exchange risk\n\nThe Group is exposed to FX risk through its holding of cash denominated in foreign currencies, primarily Euro and US Dollar, within its travel money bureaux in J Sainsbury plc stores and its currency dispensing ATM machines. Foreign exchange risk is currently mitigated through forward rate transactions. Further details of the hedging arrangements in place at year end are disclosed in note 19.\n\n## Risk Appetite Measures\n\nThe Bank's market risk appetite statements defines limits for the following market risk measures:\n\n- -Capital at Risk: an aggregate measure based on assessing each of the IRRBB risks and allocating a capital charge against each risk driver using a series of plausible but severe interest rate stresses. This includes parallel and nonparallel movements of the yield curve. Where applicable a customer behavioural repayment profile is applied.\n- -Annual Earnings at Risk : measures the sensitivity of the Bank's earnings over the next 12 months, in response to adverse movements in interest rates.\n- -Net Open Currency Position: measures the Bank's net open currency position aggregated across all currencies.\n\n## Controls and Mitigants\n\nThe Market Risk Policy defines the approach the Bank must apply to measure, monitor, and control market risk which includes the Board approved market risk appetite statement and specific limits. The Treasury function undertakes the day to day management of market risk, using systems and models to assess risk exposure against limits. Oversight is provided by the Financial Risk team in 2nd line.\n\nThe main hedging instruments used to hedge IRRBB exposures are interest swaps as well as taking into account natural hedges between assets and liabilities with similar repricing characteristics in the first instance. Any residual exposures are then assessed against Board approved limits.\n\nHedging strategies are implemented and reviewed on a regular basis at ALCo to ensure the Bank remains within limits.\n\nEarnings at risk (change in net interest income) for changes in interest rates of +/-100 basis points movements in rates are as follows:\n\n|                      | The Group   | \u00a3m    | The Bank  \u00a3m   | 2023   |\n|----------------------|-------------|-------|----------------|--------|\n|                      | 2024        | 2023  | 2024           |        |\n|                      | \u00a3m          |       |                | \u00a3m     |\n| +/- 100 basis points | 1/2         | 1/(1) | 1/2            | 0/0    |\n\nThe above analysis assumes that interest rates would floor at 0% and would not result in negative rates becoming applicable. The methodology used in calculation of earnings at risk was changed to show a dynamic view of the balance sheet as opposed to a static balance sheet assumption applied in the 2023 financial statements.  Comparatives have been represented accordingly.\n\n## 34. Capital resources (unaudited)\n\nFrom a prudential perspective, the Bank is monitored and supervised on a consolidated basis with its subsidiary, Home Retail Group Card Services Limited. The Bank has obtained an individual consolidation waiver from the PRA, which allows the Bank to monitor its capital position on a consolidated basis only. Therefore, the capital position shown below is on a regulatory consolidated basis.\n\nRegulatory capital is calculated under the Capital Requirements Regulations and Capital Requirements Directive (collectively known as CRD IV). In 2020, an alternative transitional model was introduced to relieve Covid-19 related ECL increases within regulatory capital over a period of five years. As a result, the Bank calculates the capital resources on a transitional basis in addition to the full impact at the balance sheet date as shown below.",

Capital resources (unaudited) ( continued )\n\n## Leverage ratio (unaudited)\n\nThe leverage ratio is defined as the ratio of Tier 1 capital to adjusted assets, which is measured below on a regulatory consolidated basis. The denominator represents the total non-risk weighted assets of the regulatory group adjusted for certain off balance sheet exposures assets and regulatory deductions and provides a non-risk-weighted 'backstop' capital measure. The leverage ratio is calculated below as at 29 February 2024 on the UK basis which allows central bank assets to be excluded from the leverage exposures. The Bank's leverage ratio of 11.3% (2023: 9.6%) exceeds the minimum Basel leverage ratio of 3%.\n\n-\n\n| The regulatory consolidated group                                     | Transitional  2024  IFRS9  \u00a3m   | Full impact  2024  IFRS9  \u00a3m   | Transitional  2023  IFRS9  \u00a3m   | Full impact  2023  IFRS9  \u00a3m   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|--------------------------------|---------------------------------|--------------------------------|\n| Components of the leverage ratio                                      |                                 |                                |                                 |                                |\n| Total assets as per published financial  statements                   | 6,816                           | 6,816                          | 7,209                           | 7,209                          |\n| Movement on consolidation of subsidiary  undertakings                 | (6)                             | (6)                            | (6)                             | (6)                            |\n| Exposure value for derivatives and securities  financing transactions | 30                              | 30                             | 32                              | 32                             |\n| Off balance sheet exposures: unconditionally  cancellable (10%)       | 769                             | 769                            | 867                             | 867                            |\n| Off balance sheet: other (100%)                                       | 1                               | 1                              | 2                               | 2                              |\n| Other adjustments                                                     | (78)                            | (78)                           | (243)                           | (266)                          |\n| Transitional adjustment                                               | 1                               | -                              | -                               |                                |\n| Central bank claims                                                   | (886)                           | (886)                          | (331)                           | (331)                          |\n|                                                                       | 6,647                           | 6,646                          | 7,530                           | 7,507                          |\n| Tier 1 capital                                                        | 749                             | 748                            | 722                             | 699                            |\n| Leverage ratio                                                        | 11.3%                           | 11.3%                          | 9.6%                            | 9.3%                           |\n\n## Capital management\n\nThe Group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments to it in light of changes in economic conditions and the risk characteristics of its activities.

Fair value of financial instruments\n\n## Fair value hierarchy\n\nIFRS 13 specifies a hierarchy of valuation techniques based on whether the inputs to those valuation techniques are observable or unobservable. Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources; unobservable inputs reflect the Group's market assumptions. These two types of inputs have created the following fair value hierarchy:\n\n## Level 1\n\nQuoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. This level includes listed equity securities and debt instruments on exchanges (for example, London Stock Exchange, Frankfurt Stock Exchange, New York Stock Exchange) and exchange traded derivatives like futures.\n\n## Level 2\n\nInputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (that is, as prices) or indirectly (that is, derived from prices). The sources of input parameters like SONIA  yield curve or counterparty credit risk are Bloomberg and Reuters.\n\n## Level 3\n\nInputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs). This level includes equity investments and debt instruments with significant unobservable components.\n\nThis hierarchy requires the use of observable market data when available.

Cash flows are discounted at current market rates to determine fair value. The market rates used in discounting ensure a required level of return to market participants taking into account factors such as interest rate risk, credit risk and prepayment risk and therefore it is appropriate to discount contractual cash inflows by these amounts.\n\nFor fixed interest-bearing deposits and other borrowings without quoted market price, valuations are based on discounted cash flows using market interest rates for new lending with similar remaining maturity. The  estimated fair value of deposits with no stated maturity is the amount repayable on demand .\n\n## 36. Parent company\n\nThe immediate and ultimate parent company and controlling party of the Bank is J Sainsbury plc, which is registered in England. Its registered office is 33 Holborn, London, EC1N 2HT. J Sainsbury plc forms the only group into which the financial statements of the Group are consolidated. Copies of the parent company's financial statements may be obtained from www.about.sainsburys.co.uk.\n\n## 37. Share-based payments\n\n## Accounting policy\n\nThe Group, through schemes operated by its parent company J Sainsbury plc, provides benefits to employees (including Directors) in the form of equity-settled and cash-settled share-based payment transactions, whereby employees render services in exchange for shares, rights over shares or the value of those shares in cash terms.\n\nFor equity-settled share-based payments the fair value of the employee services rendered is determined by reference to the fair value of the shares awarded or options granted, excluding the impact of any non-market vesting conditions. All share options are valued using an option-pricing model (Black-Scholes). This fair value is charged  to  the  income  statement  over  the  vesting  period  of  the  share-based  payment  scheme  with  a corresponding increase to equity.\n\nThe value of the charge is adjusted in the income statement over the remainder of the vesting period to reflect expected and actual levels of options vesting, with the corresponding adjustments made in equity and accruals.\n\n## Income statement\n\nThe Group recognised \u00a36m (2023: \u00a35m) of employee costs (note 7) related to share-based payment transactions made during the financial year. Of these, \u00a3nil (2023: \u00a3nil) were cash-settled.\n\nThe parent company, J Sainsbury plc, operates various share-based payment schemes, in which employees of the Group participate.",

Savings Related Share Option Scheme (Sharesave)\n\nThe Sainsbury's Group operates a Savings-Related Share Option Scheme, which is open to all UK employees with more than three months' continuous service. This is an approved HMRC Scheme and was established in 1980. Under Sharesave, participants remaining in the Sainsbury's Group's employment at the end of the three-year (and historically also five-year) savings period are entitled to use their savings to purchase shares in J Sainsbury plc at a pre-stated exercise price.\n\nEmployees leaving for certain reasons can use their savings to purchase shares within six months of their leaving.\n\n|                                                  | 2024   Number of  options  million   | 2024   Weighted  average exercise  price  pence   | 2023   Number of  options  million   | 2023   Weighted  average exercise  price  pence   |\n|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|\n| Outstanding at end of year                       | 1.6                                  | 188                                               | 1.5                                  | 176.2                                             |\n| Exercisable at end of year                       | -                                    | -                                                 | 0.2                                  | 164.9                                             |\n| Exercisable price range                          |                                      | 161 to 260                                        |                                      | 161 to 260                                        |\n|                                                  |                                      | 2024                                              |                                      | 2023                                              |\n| Weighted average share price at date of exercise |                                      | 267                                               |                                      | 259                                               |\n| Weighted average remaining contractual life      |                                      | 2.3 years                                         |                                      | 2.8 years                                         |\n\nOptions granted during the year were valued using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.

Long-Term Incentive Plan\n\nUnder the Long-Term Incentive Plan, shares in J Sainsbury plc are conditionally awarded to the senior leaders in the Company. The core awards are calculated as a percentage of the participants' salaries and scaled according to grades.\n\nPerformance is measured at the end of the three-year performance period. If the required performance conditions, which are financial and non-financial non-market conditions, have been met, the awards vest and the participants are able to exercise 100% of the awards received. For 2020 awards and prior, recipients were only able to receive 50% of their awards after 3 years and 50% of their awards after 4 years. From 2021 onwards, schemes vest and participants are able to exercise after 3 years.  Options granted will expire five years from the grant date.\n\nDividends will accrue on the shares that vest in the form of additional shares, except for certain colleagues who are unable to receive dividend equivalents due to financial services regulations. For awards granted in and before the year ended 4 March 2023, a core share award was granted which could  grow by up to four times, dependent on the level of performance. For awards granted in the year to 2 March 2024, the maximum share award is allocated, and the award will vest between 0 per cent and 100 per cent based on performance against targets. Awards are structured as nil cost awards.",

Nil-cost Share Award\n\nThe nil price share option schemes include Deferred Share Awards, Bonus Share Awards and other Conditional Awards.\n\nThe last awards made under the Deferred Share Award plan were made in 2021. All options outstanding in 2023 were released to participants in 2024.\n\nSenior Leaders receive a percentage of their bonus award in shares. Before 2021, bonus awards had a three-year deferral period. However, awards granted from 2021 now have a deferral period of two years, except for certain colleagues who are subject to a deferral period due to financial services regulations.\n\nOther conditional awards relate to the retention and recruitment of Senior Leaders as part of the wider reward strategy.
