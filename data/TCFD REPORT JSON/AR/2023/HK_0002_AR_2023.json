Our commitment to build a sustainable business remained the bedrock of our purpose to Power Brighter Tomorrows through a year in which we delivered significant growth despite persistent energy market volatility. We also took steps to enhance the way we report our business, providing stakeholders with greater insight into our strategies and objectives.\n\nThis year's Annual Report has been restructured to better frame the discussion about how we deliver our sustainability agenda with reference to the new International Sustainability Standards Board's IFRS S1 and IFRS S2 standards. Published in 2023, the standards define best practices for companies to improve disclosures on sustainability and allow capital providers to make more informed investment decisions.\n\nWe continued our double materiality approach, and the Annual Report focuses on the financial effects of material topics that may affect the business's cash flow, access to finance and cost of capital. Topics that have a material impact on people, the environment and the economy are covered by our Sustainability Report, which also explores the Group's strategies for managing nature-related issues in line with the new Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures framework.\n\nOur disclosures continue to meet - and in many respects exceed - regulatory requirements and reporting frameworks, including the Hong Kong Listing Rules. They reflect our determination to further enhance our reporting and provide a comprehensive view of our efforts to create long-term, sustainable value for our stakeholders above and beyond financial performance.\n\nDecarbonisation remains CLP's foremost priority. Our updated Climate Vision 2050 coincides with the release of the Annual Report and Sustainability Report and sets out our strengthened target for 2030, as we continue our journey to net-zero greenhouse gas emissions across the value chain by 2050.\n\nThe content of the Annual Report, Sustainability Report and Climate Vision 2050 have been streamlined to avoid any overlap and enable readers to access the information they require more easily. We sincerely hope you find our reports thought-provoking and insightful.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nA Snapshot of 2023 Annual Report\n\n2023 Sustainability Report\n\nClimate Vision 2050: Powering an orderly transition",

Its business spans every major segment of the electricity value chain ranging from power generation, transmission and distribution to retail and smart energy services. CLP strives to embrace new opportunities and expand its horizons to meet the evolving needs of energy users in a world being reshaped by decarbonisation and digitalisation.\n\nMainland China\n\nTaiwan Region and Thailand\n\nHong Kong\n\nAustralia\n\nIndia\n\nGeneration and energy storage capacity by asset type\n\nWind\n\nSolar\n\nHydro\n\nNuclear\n\nGas\n\nCoal\n\nEnergy Storage\n\nWaste-to-energy\n\nOthers\n\nTotal\n\n2,391MW\n\n842MW\n\n489MW\n\n2,685MW\n\n6,093MW\n\n9,719MW\n\n763MW\n\n10MW\n\n300MW\n\n23,291\n\nMW\n\nNote: Any minor discrepancies are due to rounding of figures.

CLP Power Hong Kong Limited, the larger of the two companies and a wholly owned subsidiary of the Group, provides a power supply of 99.999% world-class reliability to about 2.79 million customers in Kowloon, the New Territories and most of the outlying islands, serving more than 80% of the city's population.\n\nThe electricity industry in Mainland China is largely state-controlled. Transmission and distribution are principally operated by two state-owned enterprises while generation is open for investment. As the country continues to open up its energy market, the provision of sustainable energy services to customers also presents great potential for private investments. CLP first entered the market in 1979 when the Group began providing electricity to Guangdong province. Today, CLP China is one of the largest external investors in the energy sector in Mainland China with over 50 power projects in 15 provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions, concentrating on low-carbon energy, including nuclear power and renewable energy, in addition to opportunities in smart energy services.\n\nEnergyAustralia is one of the largest privately owned electricity generators under the National Electricity Market (NEM), a major gas and electricity retailer in New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and the Australian Capital Territory, and an electricity retailer in Queensland. Private generators operating under the NEM and a number of government-owned assets provide generation services in a competitive wholesale market. The electricity retail market is partially regulated while the transmission and distribution segments remain substantially regulated.\n\nMuch of the electricity industry in India has traditionally been owned and controlled by the Federal and State Governments. Since 2006, private companies have been encouraged to invest in the generation and increasingly transmission segments. On the distribution side, the Federal Government has recently progressed initiatives for more privatisation. Since entering the Indian market in 2002, CLP has built a diversified portfolio comprising wind, solar and supercritical coal generating facilities as well as transmission and advanced metering infrastructure assets. The business, a 50:50 joint venture between CLP and the Canada-based global investment group CDPQ, is operated under the Apraava Energy brand with a focus on clean energy, power transmission and other customer-focused energy businesses.\n\nCLP has minority interests in a solar project in Thailand and a coal-based generation plant in Taiwan region. The electricity industry is government-controlled in both markets.\n\nIndia\n\nHK$301 million\n\nTaiwan Region and\n\nThailand\n\nHK$307 million\n\nOther earnings and unallocated expenses -HK$1 , 195 million\n\nTotal\n\nmillion\n\nHK$10,127\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTotal\n\n2,073\n\n2,229\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Taking into account several one-off items including the HK$5,868 million non-cash impairment of goodwill of EnergyAustralia's Customer business, total earnings were HK$6,655 million, compared with HK$924 million a year earlier.\n\nThe Board has declared a fourth interim dividend payment for 2023 of HK$1.21 per share, same as 2022. Total dividends for 2023 were unchanged at HK$3.10 per share. In line with our longstanding practice and policy on dividends, the Board struck a balance between the improvement of financial performance in 2023 and the Group's ongoing investment in the energy transition and decided to maintain the 2023 total dividends at the same level as last year. In 2024, we remain committed to build on the positive momentum established in 2023 to remunerate shareholders\n\nin line with the evolution of earnings while ensuring that a solid financial position continues to back our business growth.\n\nDuring 2023, encouraging growth and progress were achieved across all of our markets. Our five-year Development Plan was approved by the Hong Kong SAR Government, a milestone agreement that fortifies our commitment to meeting the energy demands essential for the long-term development of Hong Kong. These strategic investments will bolster economic growth, support the ongoing decarbonisation and reinforce Hong Kong's position as a smart, modern and resilient city. Notably, we took pride in successfully launching Hong Kong's first offshore LNG terminal in September that enhances the city's energy security and ensures a competitive gas supply for the benefit of our community.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nHong Kong SAR Government Chief Secretary for Administration Mr Chan Kwok-ki (right) and Chairman Sir Michael Kadoorie (left) officiate at the opening ceremony of CLP Pulse, a cultural hub housed in CLP's revitalised historic clock tower building.\n\nHong Kong SAR Government Chief Executive Mr John KC Lee (fourth from left) joins Chairman Sir Michael Kadoorie (fourth from right), CK Hutchison Holdings Limited Chairman Mr Victor TK Li (third from left), Secretary for Environment and Ecology Mr Tse Chin-wan (third from right) as well as directors and senior executives of the two power companies at the opening ceremony of the offshore LNG Terminal.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Chairman's Statement\n\nIn Mainland China, our business exhibited a strong performance led by our nuclear fleet, and an accelerated expansion of our renewable portfolio. A robust project pipeline and the commissioning of a new wind farm and a solar facility in China during 2023 underscores our commitment in meeting the country's escalating demand for renewable energy. In November, I led a delegation of CLP board members and senior management to Beijing, where we had the honour of meeting the Director of Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, Mr Xia Baolong. We were deeply encouraged by Mr Xia's recognition of our longstanding commitment to Hong Kong and China as well as his full confidence in the future of CLP's business.\n\nOur Indian joint venture, Apraava Energy, made substantial progress in 2023, particularly in non-carbon projects. The planned 300MW wind farm in Karnataka state, the commencement of partial operations at the Sidhpur wind project in Gujarat state, the continued growth of its transmission assets and the venture into smart meter business underscore a strategy to pursue diversified investments along the electricity supply chain.\n\nAlthough the energy retail market in Australia has become increasingly challenging, EnergyAustralia improved its operational performance significantly in 2023 in the wake\n\nof the 2022 energy crisis, while supporting record numbers of customers seeking assistance in managing cost of living pressure. CLP remains committed to participating in the energy transition in Australia, and building a strong and sustainable business through the opportunities arising from this journey.\n\nLooking to the future, decarbonisation stands as the foremost priority for our business and Climate Vision 2050, our blueprint for achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by mid-century, remains one of, if not the main cornerstone of our strategy. Late last year, we conducted a review to make sure that this blueprint stays aligned with the latest developments in our businesses as well as the external risks and uncertainties we face. Based on the concerted and diligent efforts within the Group to accelerate the decarbonisation of our portfolio, we have strengthened our 2030 greenhouse gas targets to further enhance our progress. The leadership team at CLP is committed to ensuring we move ahead with the requisite speed and agility needed to achieve these strengthened targets and seize the opportunities before us.\n\nAs the threat of climate change looms larger, we have witnessed extreme weather events rising in frequency and intensity. This often puts to test the resilience of our\n\nDirector of Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office Mr Xia Baolong (front row right) expresses full confidence in the future of CLP's business in a meeting with Chairman Sir Michael Kadoorie (front row left).\n\n<!-- image -->",

I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to our dedicated teams across all markets who have consistently delivered service excellence, particularly during testing circumstances. Hong Kong endured two extreme weather events in quick succession in September when Super Typhoon Saola - the most powerful storm in five years was followed by the heaviest rainstorm since records began 140 years ago which brought landslides and flooding across the city. The extraordinary professionalism and dedication our teams displayed during these adverse weather events enabled us to maintain a reliable power supply and minimise the impact on customers.\n\nOur success over a long history has been predicated not just on results, but on how we have achieved them. This philosophy was formally embedded in CLP's Value Framework two decades ago, which encompasses how we treat our people, our relationships with customers, investors, business partners, governments and the wider community. To support the Group's purpose to Power Brighter Tomorrows, we recently updated our Value Framework, simplifying our values into the three core values of Care, Excellence and Responsibility. We also brought these values to life for our people by introducing expectations of their day-to-day work and for our stakeholders by explaining how we run our business. We believe these changes will not only empower our colleagues to achieve peak performance but will also distinctly articulate our promises and obligations to our employees, customers, shareholders, business partners and society at large.\n\nIn June, I announced the appointment of Mr T.K. Chiang as Chief Executive Officer of CLP Holdings. T.K. brings with him a wealth of experience and expertise gained over 30 years with the Group. Prior to being elevated to CEO, T.K. was Managing Director of CLP Power. Stepping into this role is Mr Joseph Law, a seasoned professional who has held various senior management positions since joining CLP in 2001, culminating in his most recent role as Managing Director of CLP China. Both T.K. and Joseph have a deep connection with CLP and are strongly committed to the company's core values and culture. Another example that reflects the deep bench of talent in our executive team is the appointment of Mr Alexandre Keisser to succeed Mr Nicolas Tissot as Chief Financial Officer on 1 April. Mr Keisser joined the Group as Managing Director of CLPe Solutions in 2018, before taking on his current role as Chief Officer - International Business last year. And I wish to thank Mr Tissot for his contributions to CLP since he joined us in 2020.\n\nOur Group is well-positioned to navigate the many opportunities and uncertainties that lie ahead. The energy transition journey demands bold actions, and we stand ready to Power Brighter Tomorrows for our future generations.\n\nOn behalf of the entire Board, thank you for your continued support.\n\nThe Honourable Sir Michael Kadoorie Hong Kong, 26 February 2024\n\n<!-- image -->",

CLP has an incredible foundation for building our next successful era as we contribute to meeting the world's energy needs in cleaner and more sustainable ways. I am both humbled and excited to be leading this organisation forward.\n\nIn 2023, CLP delivered a very solid performance amid a volatile global backdrop. Our core businesses in Hong Kong and Mainland China again brought dependable contributions to the Group. We have a valuable diversified portfolio of businesses and in the past year, we strengthened our positions in Australia and India, as we contributed to the energy transition in both countries. Across all of our markets, we are building growth momentum seizing the opportunities in rising demand for sustainable energy solutions. As always, safety remains a priority for our business and the reduction in the Group's injury rates last year is testament to our ongoing efforts to make CLP a safer place for our people to work.\n\n## Hong Kong\n\nAs Hong Kong came out of the pandemic in 2023, CLP Power continued to deliver a highly reliable, environmentally sustainable and reasonably priced electricity supply to\n\nsupport the return to normal economic activities. Operating earnings from the local energy business before fair value movements rose 1.3% to HK$8,823 million as investment was made to fund Hong Kong's economic and infrastructure developments and continued decarbonisation of the energy supply.\n\nThe gradual economic recovery and record summer temperatures lifted CLP Power's electricity sales by 1.6% to 35,392 gigawatt hours (GWh) from a year earlier. Sales in the Commercial sector rose as the cessation of COVID-19 restrictions, inbound tourism and the return of large-scale events drove consumption in hotels, shops and restaurants. Higher sales in the Infrastructure and Public Services sector reflected the resumption in government services, education and transport activities. By contrast, demand from the Residential sector dipped as people spent less time at home.\n\n|                                     | Local Sales  by Sector  (GWh)   | % of Total  Local Sales   | % Increase /  (Decrease)   |\n|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------|----------------------------|\n| Residential                         | 9,929                           | 28%                       | (1.8%)                     |\n| Commercial                          | 13,673                          | 39%                       | 3.3%                       |\n| Infrastructure and  Public Services | 10,196                          | 29%                       | 3.4%                       |\n| Manufacturing                       | 1,594                           | 4%                        | (1.3%)                     |",

        "page_content": "## CEO's Strategic Review\n\nWe understand customers' concern about electricity tariffs at a time of higher global inflation. We remain committed to cost control and a diversified fuel strategy to ease the tariff pressure on customers. Helped by falling international fuel prices, we were able to reduce the Average Net Tariff for our customers by 7.4% from January 2024 compared with a year earlier. Meanwhile, we are looking after customers in need by again allocating more than HK$200 million from the CLP Community Energy Saving Fund for a series of programmes in 2024 to promote energy conservation and help the underprivileged. These include providing electricity subsidies for elderly people and tenants of subdivided units.\n\nOur 2024-2028 Development Plan was approved by the Hong Kong SAR Government in November 2023, projecting capital expenditure of around HK$52.9 billion over the five-year period to meet growing electricity demand and to support the Government's policy priorities. The plan is designed to underpin Hong Kong's accelerating economic and infrastructure development, deliver a reliable world-class electricity network, strengthen continued decarbonisation efforts and support the transition to a smart city. The Government is focused on land and housing supply, and we expect the construction of public housing units in our supply area to increase 50% to more than 150,000 over the five-year period. Hong Kong has a strong potential to become a prime regional location for data centres, and we aim to provide the power supplies and connections for up to 18 large-scale data centres by 2028, compared with just four in the previous five-year period. We are also gearing up for the upgrading of major rail and road networks in our supply area as the Government modernises the city's infrastructure.\n\nOur competitive tariffs and the investments contained in the 2024-2028 Development Plan are testament to the ability of the Scheme of Control (SoC) Agreement to deliver a costeffective, world-class electricity supply to support Hong Kong's growth. An Interim Review of the SoC Agreement was concluded in 2023 during which we agreed several modifications with the Government to further strengthen the regulatory framework. Under a special tariff relief arrangement, we will provide additional financial support for those residential customers in need if an international energy crisis causes a sharp rise in fuel costs. We also agreed a new scheme for penalty payments in the event of a widespread supply interruption, and further improvements in information transparency on fuel and operating costs.\n\nExtreme weather events are becoming more frequent and severe because of global warming, and we remain focused on strengthening our network reliability and resilience. Hong Kong was hit by Super Typhoon Saola and the heaviest rainstorm on record in the space of a week in September.\n\nOur power supply to customers was largely intact, demonstrating the resilience of our system and the effectiveness of our comprehensive preparations and response plans.\n\nThe decarbonisation of Hong Kong's power supply took a major step forward with the launch of a new offshore LNG terminal over the summer. The floating storage and regasification unit vessel moored at the jetty is the largest of its kind in the world, increasing our access to diversified supply of competitively priced natural gas from international markets.\n\nTo facilitate a phasing out of coal-fired generation, we will complete a new advanced combined-cycle gas turbine generation unit, Unit D2, at Black Point Power Station. We are also enhancing the Clean Energy Transmission System (CETS) overhead line circuits between Hong Kong and Mainland China. When its upgrade is completed in 2025, the CETS will allow for increased imports of zero-carbon energy to the city. Together with Unit D2 at Black Point Power Station, it will help to maintain power supply reliability as coal-fired generation at Castle Peak A Power Station is phased out.\n\nSeparately, the 2024-2028 Development Plan allows for CLP Power to establish a grid-scale battery energy storage system (BESS) of around 100MW to reduce peak system demand and facilitate the integration of energy from non-fossil electricity sources. We also plan to launch a pilot project to test blending hydrogen into natural gas for power generation at Black Point Power Station.\n\nWe are strengthening our digital capabilities to provide customers with more personalised energy services including energy saving recommendations and incentives, many of which are enabled by smart meters. Under a meter replacement programme that began in 2018, we have connected more than 2.23 million smart meters for CLP Power customers in Hong Kong so far and the programme will be completed by 2025.\n\nTransportation accounts for nearly one fifth of carbon emissions in Hong Kong and electrifying this sector is another vital element of the decarbonisation journey. CLP has been a key facilitator of the city's transition to a new era of eMobility. We support the Government's electrification of public transportation and commercial vehicles, and CLP Power provided technical advice for the development of an electric vehicle (EV) fleet for The Kowloon Motor Bus Company (1933) Limited while installing EV charging infrastructure for customers on private residential estates. In another initiative, CLP Power teamed up with 14 like-minded businesses and organisations to launch the eMobility Network to encourage technology exchange and the wider use of electric commercial vehicles.",

We signed multi-year contracts for RECs with various corporations, bolstering the generation of renewable energy in Hong Kong while enabling carbon emission reduction benefits for these businesses. To add further value to our customers and promote RECs, we partnered with DBS Bank (Hong Kong) Limited to launch a programme in 2023 under which the bank offers our small to medium enterprise customers a series of privilege banking offers.\n\nIncreasingly, customers are turning to sustainability-linked loans to fund projects and we help them to be more energy efficient to meet their sustainability targets. For instance, CLP Power conducted energy audits and provided energy efficiency advice to ESR Group Limited (ESR), a real asset manager, for the planned conversion of an old cold storage building into a modern data centre. ESR in turn secured funding from a sustainability-linked loan for the project. CLP Power also helped Far East Consortium International Limited secure its first sustainability-linked loan by conducting an energy audit for one of its hotels. With our\n\nsupport on energy efficiency, about HK$2.3 billion worth of sustainability-linked loans were obtained by our customers in 2023.\n\nAs we continue to develop new ways to support the energy needs of our customers, it is pleasing that CLP Power is gaining increasing recognition for the service and value it provides. We received 45 coveted awards in 2023 for customer-related areas including customer service, innovation and digital transformation from well-regarded organisations in Hong Kong and overseas.\n\nThe Group has established a growing status as a provider of Energy-as-a-Service solutions in Hong Kong and the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) through our energy infrastructure and solutions subsidiary CLPe, which supports its customers in their sustainability efforts by drawing from its engineering expertise and applying advanced technologies. For example, it has formed a partnership with property companies Henderson Land and Chinachem Group to replace the cooling system of a shopping mall and through the use of AI technology to improve energy efficiency, lower electricity consumption and reduce carbon emissions.\n\nThe new Yangzhou Gongdao Solar Power Station in Jiangsu province is equipped with an 8MW commercial use battery energy storage system, the first of its kind in the province.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Our 2024-2028 Development Plan is a roadmap for CLP to play a pivotal role to support Hong Kong's growing energy needs at a time of accelerating economic and infrastructure development.\n\n## Mainland China\n\nIn 2023, our nuclear and renewable energy investments in Mainland China performed well, although operating earnings of CLP China dropped 7.0% year-on-year from a high HK$2,229 million to HK$2,073 million, largely due to losses incurred by the coal portfolio.\n\nThe two nuclear power stations in our portfolio performed strongly. Driven by robust electricity demand, generation at Yangjiang Nuclear Power Station reached a record high. Daya Bay Nuclear Power Station continued to operate steadily to supply zero-carbon energy to Hong Kong. As the plant entered 30 years of service, large-scale planned outages are being carried out at Daya Bay. Maintenance work on one of the generating units was successfully completed in January 2024. Preparatory work on the other unit has begun and the planned outage is scheduled to be completed before the peak summer season begins.\n\nCLP China's remaining minority-owned coal-fired assets had a difficult year. The financial performance was affected by low electricity tariffs and high coal prices, coupled with a drop in overall asset utilisation due to increased renewable energy supply in the market and one generation unit underwent a repowering project.\n\nOutput and earnings from our renewable energy assets in Mainland China maintained steady performance thanks to the contribution of new wind and solar projects. Because both water resources and tariffs fell short of expectations, we booked an impairment of assets of HK$115 million for Dali Yang\\_er Hydropower Station in Yunnan province for 2023. The performance of CLP China's other hydro assets - Huaiji Hydro Power Stations in Guangdong province and Jiangbian Hydropower Station in Sichuan province - remained stable.\n\nThe expansion of our renewable energy portfolio accelerated in 2023 to meet rising demand as China pursues a dual target of peak carbon emissions by 2030 and net-zero emissions by 2060. CLP China commissioned the 50MW Xundian II Wind Farm in Yunnan and the 73.7MW Yangzhou Gongdao Solar Power Station in Jiangsu province. Yangzhou Gongdao Solar Power Station is equipped with an 8MW commercial-use BESS, the first of its kind in the province. We began construction of the 150MW Bobai Wind Farm in Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region which is due to go into service in 2024. Construction is due to begin soon on the Sandu II Wind Farm (100MW) in Guizhou province, and on two 100MW solar projects in Huai'an and Yixing in Jiangsu.\n\nCEO T.K.

        "page_content": "All our newly commissioned projects and those under construction and planning are grid-parity initiatives designed to operate without government subsidies. As for legacy subsidised projects, by the end of December, the amount of accumulated national subsidy payments owed to CLP China's renewable energy subsidiaries was HK$2,426 million, compared with HK$2,111 million a year earlier.\n\nBeyond assets under construction, we have secured construction quotas for three renewable energy projects with a combined capacity of 660MW in Guangxi, and three more projects in Shandong province with a total capacity of 530MW. Although it is uncertain at this stage if all the projects will proceed, we are firmly committed to expanding our portfolio by developing greenfield sites.\n\nExpanding our existing projects onto adjacent sites is another growth strategy that enables synergies and economies of scale. We are exploring the possibility of adding more capacity at Xundian and Sandu wind farms as well as other locations.\n\nCLP broke new ground in corporate partnerships by entering into a strategic cooperation framework agreement with Shui On Xintiandi (Shui On), a leading investor and manager of premium and sustainable commercial properties. This involves a 10-year power purchase agreement (PPA) under which CLP will supply renewable energy from Yangzhou Gongdao Solar Power Station to Shui On's Nanjing International Finance Center commercial and office complex. The agreement is the first medium to long-term agreement of its kind signed by CLP in Mainland China. We also signed our largest Green Electricity Certificate (GEC) contract with a prominent global data centre operator for five years, enabling the customer to claim the environmental benefits associated with renewable energy generation. Both contracts demonstrate our commitment to providing non-carbon energy solutions that help business customers achieve their sustainability goals.\n\nWe believe there is high demand for our PPAs and GECs as companies worldwide seek to reduce their carbon emissions. We are proactively expanding our renewable energy portfolio to meet rising demand, which is particularly pronounced in eastern and southern provinces such as Guangdong, Guangxi, Shanghai, Jiangsu and Zhejiang.\n\nShandong, where we have wind projects with a combined capacity of about 600MW in operation, is another strategic area for business development. I had the honour to speak in October at the Fourth Qingdao Multinationals Summit jointly hosted by the Ministry of Commerce of the People's Republic of China and the People's Government of Shandong, where we pledged to support the continuing development of clean energy in Mainland China. This followed an official visit to CLP's headquarters by Shandong Governor Mr Zhou Naixiang\n\nin May when we made clear our determination to play a greater role in the decarbonisation of the province.\n\nTo capture opportunities from the growth of energy sustainability technologies and solutions in the GBA, CLPe set up a new office in Longhua district in Shenzhen in April 2023 and has continued to strengthen its capabilities. The business expanded its partnership with MTR Shenzhen last year by winning two new projects to install and operate solar energy systems for the rail operator's premises in Longhua, after completing a similar project in 2022.\n\nIn September, CLPe signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Link Asset Management Limited (Link) to develop one-stop energy solutions at Link's premises in the Mainland GBA cities.\n\nChina continues to take the lead in the electrification of transport and since 2022, CLPe has been operating an EV charging joint venture with TELD New Energy Company Limited. The business expanded its coverage to over 180 charging stations offering more than 5,500 chargers in the cities of Dongguan, Shenzhen and Zhuhai in the GBA by the end of 2023.\n\nThe ascent of China as an economic powerhouse has been one of the defining stories of this era. With our established nuclear operations, a dedication to growing our renewable energy portfolio, strong corporate partnerships and Energy-as-a-Service solutions, CLP is ideally placed to support China on the journey to decarbonisation as it writes the next chapters of a remarkable economic success story.\n\n## Australia\n\nWe announced in late January 2024 that we expected to make an impairment charge following an assessment of the goodwill of the Customer business of our wholly owned subsidiary EnergyAustralia. The impairment reflected a more challenging outlook for the retail energy market as competition levels increased over the second half of 2023.\n\nNotwithstanding that, EnergyAustralia's performance is set on a path of recovery with its operating loss before fair value movements narrowed from HK$2,330 million in 2022 to HK$182 million in 2023. In a sharp contrast to the large fair value losses reported in 2022, fair value movements in 2023 were favourable largely due to the roll off of energy contracts sold before the energy crisis.\n\nWith the normalisation of wholesale electricity prices, improved power station performance and higher realised prices, contribution from EnergyAustralia's generation business turned around. Sent out from Yallourn Power Station in Victoria was steady as availability rose from 67% in 2022 to around 72% following an improvement in operations. This is despite the fact that to ensure the continued reliability",

Similar maintenance will be carried out on the other two units in 2024.\n\nHigh availability was also maintained at Mount Piper Power Station in New South Wales, although output was lower year-on-year because of reduced market demand and lower wholesale electricity prices. Mount Piper is supplied with coal primarily from the nearby Springvale mine. Poor mine water quality led to reduced dewatering capacity for the mine, resulting in a risk of underground mine flooding in the second half. EnergyAustralia supported the mine operator with mitigations to ensure that the coal supply and financial performance of Mount Piper for 2023 were not materially impacted by this issue. However, looking ahead, there is still a risk of coal supply disruptions, even with the new, more flexible multi-mine long-term contract that was put in place in 2023.\n\nOn the project front, EnergyAustralia made significant progress with its distributed and flexible capacity initiatives. The new 320MW Tallawarra B gas-fired power station was officially opened in February 2024. Fast-start gas generation assets like Tallawarra B will play an increasingly critical role in providing electricity at peak periods and times of low sunshine and wind.\n\nThe commissioning of Tallawarra B and the rolling maintenance at Yallourn Power Station were part of a comprehensive programme by EnergyAustralia to prepare for demand in the summer of 2023/24.\n\nEnergyAustralia moved forward with the development of Wooreen Energy Storage System in Victoria after receiving development approval in February and grid connection clearance in December. The four-hour utility-scale battery with 350MW of capacity is scheduled to go into service by the end of 2026.\n\nIn September, EnergyAustralia took commercial control of New South Wales's largest energy storage system - the Riverina Stage 2 and Darlington Point batteries which have the capacity to provide energy for around 49,000 homes for two hours.\n\nTo further expand its renewable energy portfolio, EnergyAustralia signed a PPA with Genex Power for 30% of the output of the 258MW Kidston Stage 3 wind project in Queensland for 10 years. This followed an earlier energy storage services agreement with Genex for the 250MW Kidston pumped storage hydro project.\n\nEnergyAustralia has released the concept design for the Lake Lyell pumped hydro project in New South Wales. Work on the 335MW project, capable of providing energy for 150,000 homes for up to eight hours, is expected to begin in the second half of 2025 if approved and will take at least four years to complete.",

EnergyAustralia expects to support investment of more than A$5 billion in capital directly and with partners under its inaugural Climate Transition Action Plan (CTAP) released in August.\n\nThe CTAP was followed by an expansion of the Capacity Investment Scheme (CIS) by the Australian Government. The Wooreen project together with another battery project next to the Hallet gas-fired power station will be submitted to the first round of the newly expanded CIS that focuses on projects in Victoria and South Australia.\n\nDespite several tariff increases, rising supply costs and intensifying competition drove EnergyAustralia's retail business contribution lower than in 2022. The overall number of customer accounts fell by around 20,700, or 0.8%, in 2023, while the rate of customer churn remained below the market average. Despite the goodwill impairment, the Customer business remains a key component of the EnergyAustralia integrated business model.\n\nEnergyAustralia is keenly aware that inflation weighs heavily on customers and does its utmost to support them through a variety of payment plans and extension arrangements. Help for customers impacted by financial hardship is available under the EnergyAssist and Rapid Business Assist programmes.\n\nEnergyAustralia is firmly focused on making further progress in its path of recovery through strengthening its operational performance. It will seek to expand its 'behind-the-meter' energy solution offerings to customers in the areas of battery storage, solar energy and electric vehicles. With its strategy of providing simple solutions to customers and its flexible, expanding portfolio, EnergyAustralia is committed to participating sustainably in the country's vital energy transition.\n\n## India\n\nOur joint venture Apraava Energy made good progress in expanding and diversifying its low-carbon portfolio to support the decarbonisation of India's energy sector and to meet the rising demand for power. Successful bids were made for new wind, solar and transmission projects. The business also made a successful entry into the emerging advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) sector.\n\nThe joint venture also delivered a significant improvement in financial performance. Operating earnings in 2023 were HK$301 million, up 56.0% from a year earlier, driven by Jhajjar Power Station's strong operating efficiency and performance with solid contribution from Apraava Energy's renewable portfolio. The business benefitted from higher\n\ninterest income after the Madhya Pradesh state utility made payments towards outstanding dues for output from Chandgarh Wind Farm, while utilities in other states also adhered to the new late payment surcharge rules introduced by the Government of India.\n\nApraava Energy won bids to develop a greenfield wind energy project with a capacity of around 300MW in Karnataka state and a 250MW solar energy project in Rajasthan state, demonstrating the surge in opportunities offered by India's fast-expanding renewable energy market. Construction of the solar farm - Apraava Energy's first greenfield solar energy project - will begin in the first quarter of 2024 and it is due to begin operations in 2026. The wind farm in Karnataka is also due to go into service in 2026.\n\nApraava Energy also won bids to develop three greenfield interstate transmission projects. Two are in Rajasthan involving a total of about 250 kilometres of 400 kilovolt (kV) transmission lines and a pooling substation that will allow 20GW of renewable energy to feed into the grid. Both are expected to be completed in 2025. The third project, awarded in December 2023, is in Madhya Pradesh and includes a 4,000 mega volt amp (MVA) substation and approximately 41 kilometres of 765kV transmission lines to cater to rising demand across the state. It is expected to take around two years to build after the required approvals, which are anticipated to be granted in 2024.\n\nSmart meters have an important role to play in India's energy transition by helping to balance supply and demand in the electricity market. Apraava Energy established a foothold in this key segment by securing two AMI projects in Assam and Gujarat states. More than 2.3 million smart meters will be installed for customers in Gujarat and around 700,000 in Assam.\n\nThe 251MW Sidhpur Wind Farm in Gujarat state is due to be completed in the first half of 2024 following delays caused by land use disagreements that held up the installation of transmission infrastructure. The plant has been put into service in phases with more than half its generation capacity currently in operation.\n\nApraava Energy's greenhouse gas reduction target was validated as being in line with the target of limiting global warming to 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi), a recognised international body promoting decarbonisation for businesses worldwide. Apraava Energy was one of only a handful of power companies in India to achieve this validation and the achievement highlights its leadership role in decarbonisation.\n\nWind energy assets performed well throughout the year with overall output increasing 23% due to higher resources and partial commissioning of Sidhpur. Generation from Apraava Energy's operating solar energy assets increased by 12% compared with the previous year.",

        "page_content": "## CEO's Strategic Review\n\nApraava Energy's only coal-fired asset, Jhajjar Power Station, maintained its reputation as one of India's best-run thermal power plants and achieved a record level of generation. Jhajjar also promoted sustainable energy sources by co-firing more biomass than any other coal-fired power station in the country. The power station benefitted from a one-off income emanating from an interim settlement of an ongoing dispute with its main electricity purchasers over contractual and operational issues dating back to 2012. This is reflected in our accounts as an item affecting comparability.\n\nWith the stalwart support of the CLP Group and CDPQ, Apraava Energy will continue to explore growth opportunities to strengthen its portfolio of renewable energy plants and transmission and AMI projects. The company's expansion and commitment to decarbonisation make us an influential player in India's ambitious energy transition.\n\n## Taiwan Region and Thailand\n\nDuring the year, Ho-Ping Power Station in the Taiwan Region maintained reliable operations, with its financial performance benefitting from lower coal costs and higher energy tariff following an amendment to the tariff reimbursement mechanism in July 2022. Contributions from Lopburi Solar Farm in Thailand remained stable. As a result, operating earnings for Taiwan Region and Thailand increased to HK$307 million from HK$11 million a year earlier.\n\nHo-Ping will continue to focus on strengthening its operations with a scheduled maintenance outage on one of its two generation units in the first quarter of 2024.\n\n## Powering Brighter Tomorrows\n\nAt a time of enormous change in the energy sector, we are working tirelessly to ensure CLP Group is well positioned to thrive in all of the markets in which we operate. As the Chairman noted in his message, the principal priority for our business is decarbonisation. This is an urgent and complex task, but we have both the commitment and roadmap to meet the challenge. Guided by our strategic focus, during the year we advanced resolutely towards our own net zero goal, aligning our efforts with the broader decarbonisation initiatives taking shape across all our markets.\n\nReflecting on my 35-year journey with CLP, our enduring focus on long-term, sustainable growth has never been more pronounced. Today more than ever, it is critical for us to upskill and reskill our people so that we are ready for change. We also need to ensure a strong pipeline of talent to meet our needs. As part of our holistic approach in talent development, we invest tremendous resources to support the professional growth of our people and generate the\n\ninterest of students and young people in pursuing careers in the electricity industry. We have an established, long-term strategy to cultivate them with a powerful sense of belonging, trust and cooperation combined with the leadership skills to carry our business forward.\n\nThe decarbonisation process isn't just a challenge; it's an opportunity for diversified and profitable growth. Across our markets, we are capitalising on opportunities that yield robust returns, providing low-carbon solutions, and ensuring the delivery of safe, reliable and secure energy services to our customers and communities. As we do so, we are harnessing digital technologies throughout every level of the Group to optimise our business processes and introduce new ways of working in a manner tailored for the specific markets in which we are present. This integration is geared towards producing faster, better and more cost-effective outcomes for our customers, colleagues and partners.\n\nAs decarbonisation and digitalisation reshape the electricity sector, we must work hard to train and develop the visionary and highly motivated industry leaders who will carry the energy transition forward in the vital years ahead.\n\nI would like to thank all of our valued shareholders and customers for the trust they place in CLP. I also extend my thanks to my outstanding colleagues, whose care, excellence and responsibility are critical to our success. Our culture is crucial to making our aspirations a reality and we will implement further initiatives to ensure we remain efficient, people-centric and agile in how we operate. We will place more of our resources and expertise even closer to our customers, while ensuring that we have the appropriate level of governance in place to reflect the evolving nature of our business.\n\nDespite our uncertain world, the prospects for CLP remain clear. We have a great business and an unwavering intent to take it into the next chapter of growth. We are grateful for your steadfast support as we help shape the future of energy to the benefit of all of our stakeholders.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nT.K. Chiang\n\nHong Kong, 26 February 2024",

What missions and strategies do you have in mind to steer the company forward? What are the challenges you anticipate?\n\nCLP is one of the most familiar and trusted brands in Hong Kong. I feel deeply privileged to have the opportunity to lead the company forward at this exciting moment in its long history.\n\nFor more than 120 years, CLP has succeeded by anticipating and embracing changes in the market. Our proven capacity to transform ourselves and explore new horizons fills me with excitement and confidence in my new role as I work closely with my colleagues to deliver our key strategies.\n\nDecarbonisation is CLP's top priority. We understand the critical role the electricity sector has in the fight against climate change, and we are committed to playing our part in this urgent and complex challenge. We recently reviewed our Climate Vision 2050 roadmap and strengthened our 2030 greenhouse gas emissions intensity target to bring us closer to the goal of limiting global warming to 1.5\u00b0C. As well as lowering our own emissions, we do all we can to help customers reduce their carbon footprint. Meanwhile, digitalisation will be another major factor in our future growth. We must constantly enhance our digital capabilities and integrate new technologies into our operations to stay ahead of the curve.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur overarching purpose to Power Brighter Tomorrows requires more than just new technology and infrastructure. It also calls for investment in our people to build a strong pipeline of talent to lead our company forward. We must cultivate the desired values and culture so as to maintain our solid foundation while encouraging agility and innovation to meet rapidly evolving energy needs. I have shared with colleagues my expectation for them to learn, unlearn and relearn as we accelerate our efforts to pursue excellence as guided by our refreshed Value Framework. To build a future-proof organisation together, I call on my colleagues to retain a keen sense of curiosity and adaptability that we all had when we were children.\n\nThe significant strides forward we have taken in the past year put us in a powerful position to seize the opportunities offered by the energy transition as we continue to build a sustainable business that creates long-term value for our stakeholders.\n\nT.K.

        "page_content": "## Financial Review\n\n## CLP Group's financial Results and Position at a Glance CLP Group's Financial Results and Position at a Glance\n\n## Strategy to Power Brighter Tomorrows\n\nWe remain focused on decarbonising and digitalising our operations in order to create value for our stakeholders and the communities in which we operate. Meanwhile, we are also building greater organisational agility through workforce transformation to equip ourselves for future opportunities. CLP underpins great effort to ensure Hong Kong remains a vibrant international centre, one that is playing a leading role in Asia in the transition to a net-zero future. We have a strong commitment to decarbonisation and pursue diversified investment opportunities in our overseas markets. Additionally, we are continuously enhancing our digital capabilities to not only deliver operational excellence for our businesses, but also provide bespoke energy service solutions to our customers.\n\n## Progress on the Execution of Our Strategy\n\nOur commitment to invest for Hong Kong's low-carbon future continue being evidenced through the new offshore LNG terminal which has been in service since July 2023, the construction of unit D2 at Black Point Power Station, and the enhancement of the Clean Energy Transmission System (CETS), which allows more imports of zero-carbon energy from Mainland China. Renewable portfolio in Mainland China was expanded at an accelerated pace with the commissioning of Xundian II wind project and Yangzhou Gongdao solar project, as well as the commencement of construction of Bobai wind farm in 2023. Sandu II wind farms and two other solar projects are due to start work soon.\n\nThe construction of Australia's first net-zero emissions power plant, Tallawarra B, continued during the year and is now completing commissioning. Commercial operation of Riverina and Darlington Point, New South Wales's largest energy storage system of which EnergyAustralia has market control for contracted output, commenced in September. In India, over 50% of the Sidhpur wind project was commissioned in 2023. Our joint venture, Apraava Energy also entered into the advanced metering infrastructure market.\n\n## Adequate Resources to Support Our Strategy\n\nFree cash flow represents the cash that can be used by a company after taking care of its operations. It can be used to remunerate equity and debt holders and to grow the business.\n\nStrong operating cash inflow from the SoC business continues to be the key source of funds for our capital investment programme and dividend payment in 2023. Our free cash flow also benefited from the refund of futures margin deposits and recovering operational performance at EnergyAustralia. During the year, we continue to carry out sustainable financing activities under Climate Action Finance Framework, for specific projects, and arrange Emission Reduction-Linked bank facilities with performance targets linked to emissions level for general corporate purposes.\n\n## Where We Stand\n\n- HK$5.1 billion of our capital investments, on accrual basis, spent on building our decarbonisation portfolio in 2023\n- Continue to grow sustainable energy solutions business to help customers meet their decarbonisation and sustainability targets\n- Over 75% of operating earnings before fair value movements and unallocated expenses generated from non-carbon generation assets, and transmission, distribution and retail operations\n- Backed by strong investment grade credit ratings and progressive recovery of operating cash flow, adequate liquidity remains to meet the operational needs and support growth\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Earnings and Dividends\n\nCLP's Dividends Policy aims to provide reliable and consistent ordinary dividends with steady growth when supported by our earnings whilst ensuring that a solid financial position can be maintained to fund our business growth.\n\nThe Group's financial performance, and ultimately the Group's operating earnings, are of paramount importance in CLP's ability to stick to the Group's Dividends Policy. Taking into account the strong financial performance for the year, our robust financial position and our capacity to finance the investment plan of the Group, total dividends per share for 2023 are therefore maintained at HK$3.10.\n\nMore analysis on the value we created for our shareholders can be found on pages 38 and 39.",

Apraava Energy is therefore now accounted for as a joint venture, so its financial results are no longer line-by-line consolidated into the CLP Group's consolidated financial statements. CLP gets its share of earnings (one-line equity consolidation) but not revenue nor expenses. Had the equity accounting basis been adopted in 2022, the share of results (60%) of Apraava Energy would have been HK$193 million as compared to HK$1,425 million included in Consolidated EBITDAF for the year ended 31 December 2022.",

renewable earnings marginally lower than 2022 because of lower water resource largely offset by the commissioning of Xundian II wind project and Yangzhou Gongdao solar project; loss (2022: profit) from Guohua coalfired projects due to planned outage of one unit at Panshan and reduction in tariffs in 2023;

Energy business improved operationally and commercially after 2022 which was heavily penalised by costs for settling sold forward contracts not covered due to generation shortfall under record high wholesale electricity price environment, Yallourn delivered higher realised prices and gas portfolio gross margin was higher in 2023; lower contribution from Customer business due to higher realised energy procurement costs in 2023 and one-off favourable hedging outcomes under volatile market conditions in 2022 not repeated, partially offset by several tariff increases since the second half of 2022\n- India: After adjusting the impact of change in accounting method for our interest in Apraava Energy (-HK$1,232 million as discussed in the previous page) and 10% reduction in interest (-HK$32 million), higher Apraava Energy's results mainly contributed by Jhajjar 's strong operating efficiency and performance; higher delayed payment charge income and higher natural resources for renewable projects; and higher earnings from transmission project with lower financing costs\n- Taiwan Region and Thailand: Following the amendment of the energy tariff reimbursement mechanism effective July 2022, the under-recovery of rising coal costs resulting from the lagging adjustment mechanism in the first half of 2022 was not repeated, share of Ho-Ping 's results substantially improved to HK$297 million; sound operations of Lopburi solar farm\n- Mainland China: Recognition of an impairment provision of fixed assets and write-off of deferred tax assets with a total loss of HK$115 million triggered by reduction in utilisation hours (resulted from the dry weather and increased upstream water usage) and continuous low tariff for Dali Yang\\_er hydro project\n- Australia: EnergyAustralia's Customer business was affected by adverse energy retail market trends, notably, margins are under increasing pressure as a result of rising supply costs and intensifying competition; whilst higher interest rates have also negatively impacted the Customer business' cost of capital and as a consequence, an impairment of energy retail goodwill of HK$5,868 million was recognised as 'other charge' in the profit or loss (Note 4(a) to the Financial Statements)\n- India: One-off recognition of income relating to delayed payment charges on disputed and long outstanding trade receivables and additional capacity charge upon cash settlements received by Jhajjar",

        "page_content": "## Overview\n\nCLP provides sustainable energy solutions to create value for capital providers, customers, employees and the wider community. We aim to be a leading responsible energy provider, from one generation to the next, in order to deliver our purpose: to Power Brighter Tomorrows.\n\nMajor utilities like CLP have an important role to play in the functioning of society, acting as trusted partners to customers, governments, regulators and the community as a whole in our collective journey to a decarbonised future. We have also been the employer of choice to engineering and other top talent, and form a key part of the energy value chain, both as a consumer and provider of energy and related services. We understand the responsibilities inherent in serving the community as a utility and strive to set a benchmark for excellence in our service delivery.\n\nAs we seize the opportunities associated with the industry's growth, driven in large part by the decarbonisation, electrification and digitisation of infrastructure, we are mindful of the benefits that a strategic approach to sustainability can bring.\n\nThat's why CLP conducts comprehensive annual materiality assessments to evaluate and respond to the sustainability matters most likely to impact our business and stakeholders. These assessments ensure our corporate strategy and sustainability ambitions remain aligned, help us respond to evolving stakeholder needs, uncover emerging sustainability risks and opportunities, and support transparent public reporting.\n\nAdopting the double materiality approach\n\nThis year, CLP continues to adopt the double materiality approach, which was first applied in 2021 based on a three-year cycle. The double materiality concept expands the traditional focus of materiality on stakeholder impacts to also consider the financial effects of sustainability topics that may reasonably be expected to affect the business's cash flows, access to finance or cost of capital in the short, medium and long term, and these topics are covered by this Delivering Our Sustainability Agenda chapter in the Annual Report. The Sustainability Report, meanwhile, focuses on sustainability topics that have a material impact on people, the environment and the economy. With 2023 being Year 3 of the cycle, the focus of the assessment was on revalidation of the findings from Year 1 and Year 2, and the incorporation of incremental changes. The double materiality assessment complements CLP's risk management process, which is detailed in the Risk Management Report in the Annual Report and takes into account the material topics identified by the assessment.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWhen preparing the 2023 reporting suite, we voluntarily made reference to the recently released International Sustainability Standards Board's (ISSB's) IFRS S1 and S2 Standards, which relate to general purpose sustainability financial disclosures and climate-related financial disclosures respectively. While our Annual Report does not meet all the provisions of the standards yet, we have made strong progress in closing the gap. In addition, our materiality assessment process and results were externally assured for the first time to underline the rigour of our methodology and long-standing commitment to best practice sustainability strategy and reporting.",

        "page_content": "## Identifying and assessing our sustainability agenda\n\nIn 2021, we identified nine megatrends that were most likely to affect our business and operating environment. Following a detailed review in 2023, the megatrends are confirmed to remain relevant in CLP's current operating context.\n\nThe megatrends form the basis for us to identify and assess sustainability-related impacts, risks and opportunities (IROs). In addition, we drew on a range of internal and external sources - including CLP strategy and risk documentation, extensive interviews collating views from internal stakeholders, and scrutiny of the latest reporting standard to determine those IROs.\n\nThis comprehensive process initially identified 69 IROs, which were then assessed for materiality using our own enterprise risk framework and by incorporating the latest ISSB and Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) guidelines.\n\nAfter evaluating for magnitude/severity and likelihood, 49 IROs were assessed as 'High' or 'Extreme' and therefore material to CLP. These sustainability-related IROs were organised under six material topics and 18 sub-topics. The six topics play a key role in informing CLP's strategy, keeping its risk register up-to-date, supporting its reporting initiatives and generating sustainable returns for CLP's capital providers in 2024 and beyond.\n\nThe assessment process was conducted by a working group of internal and external materiality experts, with participation from CLP's Group Sustainability, Group Risk Management, Investor Relations and Corporate Affairs teams. Assessment outcomes were refined and validated by the Sustainability Executive Committee and endorsed by the CLP Holdings Sustainability Committee.\n\n## What are IROs?\n\n## Sustainability-related financial risks and opportunities\n\nCLP seeks to manage and respond to those sustainability-related financial risks and opportunities which may reasonably be expected to affect our cash flows, access to finance or cost of capital in the short, medium and long term. With reference to the IFRS guidance, we then disclose material information about these risks and opportunities to investors in this Delivering Our Sustainability Agenda chapter in the Annual Report. Information is considered material if omitting, misstating or obscuring it could reasonably be expected to influence investment decisions.\n\n## 9 Megatrends\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 69 IROs identified\n\n49 High/Extreme IROs assessed material to CLP\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 6 Material Topics and 18 Sub-topics\n\n- Transition to Net Zero\n- Energy Growth Opportunities\n- Energy Security and Reliability\n- A Safe, Future-Ready Workforce\n- Business Resilience\n- Community Stewardship\n\n## Stakeholder impacts\n\nCLP also manages and responds to significant positive or negative impacts on people, the environment and the economy. These impacts, which are set out in the GRI Standards, are covered in the Sustainability Report and address the concerns of a broad range of stakeholders on CLP's positive and negative contributions to sustainable development.\n\n<!-- image -->",

In Mainland China, especially in the Greater Bay Area, opportunities are significant due to the region's large population and its proximity to CLP's home market of Hong Kong. This offers prospects for mutually beneficial joint venture partnerships with public and private sector partners to accelerate the energy transition in line with government objectives, scale up electricity generation to meet rising demand as other sectors electrify, and introduce new energy products and services that meet customer needs.\n\n## ENERGY SECURITY AND RELIABILITY\n\nEnergy security and reliability have been impacted by an uncertain geopolitical environment and supply chain disruptions over recent years. Higher fuel prices have resulted in assets running at reduced capacity, which has increased costs for CLP and its customers alike. The Group must balance two vital and sometimes competing objectives: providing customers with reliable and affordable energy while continuing to make progress with its decarbonisation objectives.\n\n## A SAFE, FUTURE-READY WORKFORCE\n\nCLP's long-term success relies on its capability to attract, develop and retain a workforce that is safe and healthy, diverse and inclusive, skilled for the future, and well-supported to fulfil the customer demands of today, as well as to adapt rapidly to the social and technological changes brought by energy transition. Workplace safety, wellbeing and flexibility are top priorities. So too is the attraction, development and retention of diverse talent, with a focus on the skills needed to advance CLP's critical decarbonisation and digitalisation agendas.\n\n## BUSINESS RESILIENCE\n\nThe accelerating pace of environmental, technological, regulatory and social changes has reinforced the importance of business resilience. CLP recognises the strategic value of anticipating, withstanding and learning from disruptive events, especially in response to the growing threats posed by climate change and cybercrime.\n\n## COMMUNITY STEWARDSHIP\n\nCLP recognises its obligations to meet evolving stakeholder expectations around the positive role businesses should play in society. This includes demonstrating leadership in its decarbonisation ambitions, investing in green energy solutions that support the electrification of society, and transparently reporting on its ESG performance. Environmental stewardship extends to actively managing CLP's dependencies and impacts on nature. Employee and supplier wellbeing is another priority. The Group recognises the importance of ensuring ethical human rights practices in its value chain, as well as of supporting employees and communities impacted by the closure of its fossil fuel assets.",

Electricity companies worldwide need to keep abreast of evolving climate policies to ensure their decarbonisation plans and actions are in line with regulations. They also need to stay attuned to decarbonisation technologies to invest in non-carbon energy infrastructure such as wind and solar power, nuclear power and battery energy storage systems (BESS) as coal-fired generation is being phased out.\n\nDecarbonisation requires huge amounts of capital. Energy providers, acting as a trusted partner in the energy transition, have a responsibility to maintain sound financial foundations and to meet the rising expectations of investors on acting in the best interest of the community and the environment. Carbon markets offer potential solutions for decarbonising hard-to-abate sectors of the economy, and energy companies need to support efforts to improve their quality and consistency.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 0.26 kg CO 2 e/kWh\n\nCLP's revised GHG emissions intensity target for 2030 under updated Climate Vision 2050 (previous target 0.3kg CO 2 e/kWh)\n\n## 49%\n\nProportion of CLP's capital investments in non-carbon generation assets, and transmission, distribution and retail operations\n\n## Responding to evolving regulatory landscapes\n\nGovernments around the world agreed to transition away from fossil fuels and speed up the adoption of renewable energy at the 28 th United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP28) in Dubai during another year of record global temperatures.\n\nIn Hong Kong, under the Government's Climate Action Plan 2050, the ratio of zero-carbon energy in the fuel mix for electricity needs to increase to 60-70% by 2035 on the way to net-zero power generation by 2050.\n\nChina strengthened cooperation with the US in November to step up development of renewable energy. The initiative underscored the Chinese Government's steadfast commitment to decarbonisation, guided by its dual carbon targets of peaking carbon emissions by 2030 and achieving carbon neutrality by 2060. Driven by these goals, China already leads the world in solar energy and BESS technology.\n\nIn Australia, steps were taken at both federal and state levels to enable the energy transition, with increased support for low-carbon electricity infrastructure to boost supplies and mitigate the risk of shortfalls as coal-fired power stations are retired.

The GHG emissions intensity of electricity sold dropped to 0.54kg CO2e per kilowatt hour (kWh), lower than the 0.55kg CO2e per kWh a year earlier. Energy sent out from coal and gas assets fell 12%.\n\nCLP's Climate Vision 2050 decarbonisation blueprint has guided its business strategy since 2007. This blueprint has undergone regular reviews and updates to ensure its targets stay in line with changing climate science, technologies and policies. Following a review concluded in early 2024,",

Under the updated edition entitled Climate Vision 2050: Powering an orderly transition, CLP committed to reducing the GHG emissions intensity of electricity sold to 0.26kg CO2e/kWh by 2030, compared to the previous target of 0.3kg CO2e/kWh.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Notes:\n\n- 1 CLP's trajectory from 2007 to 2020 was based on the Group's carbon emissions intensity (kg CO2/kWh). Since 2021, in line with global best practices, CLP has reported its GHG emissions intensity based on kg CO2e/kWh.\n- 2 CLP's trajectory from 2017 to 2050 is on an equity plus long-term capacity and energy purchase basis.\n\nCLP is maintaining its target to reduce absolute Scope 3 GHG emissions from the use of sold products by 28% by 2030, from 2019 levels. This refers to the emissions from customers' combustion of the natural gas sold by EnergyAustralia. In addition, the Group's targets to reduce GHG emissions intensity of electricity sold to 0.1kg CO2e/kWh by 2040, and achieve net zero by 2050 remained unchanged. The Group is committed to reviewing its targets for Climate Vision 2050 at least every three years.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPlease see CLP's Climate Vision 2050 - Powering an orderly transition for further information on the latest decarbonisation strategies and targets.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nEnergyAustralia released its inaugural Climate Transition Action Plan (CTAP) in August. The plan outlines how the company will achieve net-zero Scope 1 and Scope 2\n\nemissions by 2050 through a combination of actions including the retirement of coal-fired power plants and the development of renewable energy and energy storage capacity. EnergyAustralia will publish its decarbonisation plan for Scope 3 emissions, including customer energy-use emissions, by December 2024.\n\nApraava Energy announced a target of reducing the intensity of its Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions by 46.3% by 2027 compared with 2022. The target was validated by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi), making Apraava Energy only the second Indian power company to receive SBTi validation.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nEnergyAustralia's Climate Transition Action Plan",

The company stepped up efforts to ensure a smooth transition with a reliable and affordable supply of electricity ready for a future without coal.\n\nUnits at Castle Peak A Power Station in Hong Kong are gradually being retired and coal is not expected to be used for regular electricity generation in Castle Peak B Station beyond 2035. The completion in 2024 of the new D2 gasfired generator unit at Black Point Power Station, together with the existing D1 unit, will deliver a reliable, lowercarbon power supply as CLP gradually phases out coal-fired generation.\n\nEnergyAustralia is adapting Mount Piper Power Station in New South Wales to more flexible, short-duration operations. Modifications have been made to its generation units to enable safe operations at low loads so that it can reduce or increase generation according to market conditions. The power station is due to be transitioned to play a firming role for renewable energy by the mid-2030s before being retired before 2040.\n\nEnergyAustralia's only other coal-fired power station, Yallourn Power Station in Victoria, will close in 2028. To safeguard the livelihoods and interests of employees and communities, workers at Yallourn are provided with transitional support, including training and guidance on future career development as part of EnergyAustralia's A$10 million Power Your Future programme.\n\n## Investing in zero-carbon energy infrastructure\n\nCLP continued to focus on investments to enable the energy transition. Non-carbon generation assets, and transmission, distribution and retail operations accounted for 49% of the Group's capital investments of HK$15,674 million, on an accrual basis.\n\nInvestments in Hong Kong include the upgrading of the cross-boundary Clean Energy Transmission System (CETS) for the import of more zero-carbon energy from Mainland China, as well as the completion of the smart meter replacement programme, which will help customers better understand and manage their electricity use.\n\nCLP China stepped up the pace of renewable energy investment as the falling costs of wind and solar energy equipment made new projects more viable. At the end of the year, CLP China's renewable energy capacity increased to more than 2GW across the nation and is expected to double in the medium term.\n\nEnergyAustralia set a target of expanding its renewable energy portfolio to 3GW of committed and operational capacity by 2030, up from around 900 megawatts (MW) at present.\n\nIn 2023, Apraava Energy secured 550MW of new renewable energy projects in competitive auctions and entered the AMI market to further diversify its non-carbon energy infrastructure business. The company also expanded its portfolio of transmission assets so that renewable energy generated in remote areas can be used in urban centres.",

Decarbonising the sector is therefore critical to the battle against climate change. Shui On\n\nMr Allan B. Zhang Chief Executive Officer Shui On Xintiandi Limited\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nXintiandi's prime commercial real estate portfolio spans fast-growing cities across the Mainland and is focused on carbon reduction across the entire life cycle of projects, from construction to estate management. What solutions can CLP China provide to help us become more sustainable and support the nation's dual carbon goals of peaking carbon emissions by 2030 and achieving carbon neutrality by 2060?\n\nThe real estate industry has been a role model for other sectors of the economy by actively responding to national policies to reduce carbon emissions. CLP fully supports the industry's leadership position on decarbonisation as the nation pushes ahead with the dual carbon policies for the comprehensive green transformation of economic and social development.\n\nIn line with our Climate Vision 2050 blueprint, CLP focuses on the development of renewable energy in Mainland China where zero-carbon energy now accounts for almost 70% of our installed capacity. Our Xundian II Wind Farm in Yunnan and Yangzhou Gongdao Solar Power Station in Jiangsu were successfully connected to the grid in 2023, and construction of our Bobai Wind Farm in Guangxi has commenced. We also broke ground on the Sandu II Wind Farm in Guizhou.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe constantly explore new ways to offer renewable energy solutions for our corporate customers such as Shui On Xintiandi, a pioneer in decarbonisation. We understand that starting from 2011, your esteemed company has engaged an independent organisation to conduct annual carbon emission verification, and has since reduced your emissions by over 66%. We are extremely pleased to collaborate with corporates with a similar decarbonisation vision and signed a strategic framework agreement with your company in December 2023. With our shared heritage as Hong Kong enterprises, our partnership will concentrate on the development of zero-carbon energy and green power. One of the initiatives is a power purchase agreement to supply green power to meet all the power needs of the Nanjing International Finance Center. This project epitomises the kind of high-efficiency renewable energy solutions that will accelerate the zero-carbon transformation of the real estate sector.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCLP will continue to deepen our collaboration with businesses on new energy development to deliver mutually beneficial sustainability outcomes, supporting the nation's dual-carbon goals.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Energy storage to bolster supply reliability\n\nEnergy storage plays a vital role in decarbonisation by making power grids more reliable as more intermittent renewable energy enters the system. CLP Power aims to build a BESS with a capacity of around 100MW at Castle Peak Power Station.\n\nCLPe has found a promising avenue of growth in the strong demand for BESS from construction companies in Hong Kong, taking more than 40 orders for BESS on construction sites. CLP China is also investing in BESS to strengthen the operations of new renewable energy projects. Three battery systems are currently in operation, bolstering supply",

Operating cash flow rose 85% to HK$23,567 million compared with HK$12,734 million a year earlier. The Group maintained good access to diversified, sustainable sources of cost-effective funding throughout a year of economic uncertainty and interest rate volatility, completing financing activities in a timely and orderly manner to support the business's continued growth and development.\n\nThe strong financial position is reflected in the Group's healthy liquidity levels, with undrawn bank facilities of HK$30.9 billion and bank balances of HK$5.2 billion respectively at the end of 2023 compared with HK$31.6 billion and HK$4.3 billion a year earlier. Liquidity at CLP Holdings increased to HK$14.1 billion at the end of the year compared with HK$13.5 billion a year earlier. The high level of liquidity is expected to be maintained in 2024, supported by dividend payments and inflows from subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates.\n\n| Debt Profile as of 31 December 2023   | CLP   Holdings HK$M   | CLP Power HK$M   | CAPCO HK$M   | Other  Subsidiaries HK$M   | CLP Group HK$M   |\n|---------------------------------------|-----------------------|------------------|--------------|----------------------------|------------------|\n| Availability Facility  1              | 11,900                | 34,432           | 26,360       | 15,704                     | 88,396           |\n| Bank Loans and Other Borrowings       | -                     | 26,746           | 21,089       | 9,680                      | 57,515           |\n| Undrawn Facility                      | 11,900                | 7,686            | 5,271        | 6,024                      | 30,881           |\n\n## Note:",

Globally, central banks continued to tighten monetary policies to control inflation, maintaining interest rates at their highest levels since the global financial crisis. The yield of the benchmark 10-year US Treasury Notes surged from 3.74% in early January to 4.99% in October before retreating to 3.8% in December. Three-month Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rates reached a high of 5.73% during 2023, before softening to 5.27% by year end.\n\nThe Group took a pre-emptive approach and addressed the funding requirements for the year ahead at the end of 2022 and in early 2023. In December 2022, CAPCO arranged HK$2 billion of one-year and two-year emission reductionlinked bank loan facilities for its funding requirements in 2023. In the first half of 2023, CLP Power arranged HK$2.3 billion of one-year bank loan facilities and a HK$1.1 billion two-year emission reduction-linked bank loan facility.\n\nEmission reduction-linked

        "page_content": "## Sustainable financing instruments\n\nThe Climate Action Finance Framework (CAFF) remains CLP's main channel for sustainable financing. The framework stipulates ways in which the Group's businesses can raise financing including bonds and loans to address climate change challenges. In April, CAPCO executed a two-year offshore RMB300 million (HK$339 million) fixed rate private placement bond under CAFF and swapped the proceeds to Hong Kong dollars to refinance some existing bank loans. The bond was completed with preferential financing terms and was the first offshore RMB bond issuance for a CLP business, enabling further diversification in the Group's financing.\n\nIn May and June, CAPCO executed HK$1.3 billion of one-year and two-year energy transition bank loan facilities in line with CAFF to refinance existing loans.\n\nBoth CLP Power and CAPCO have Medium Term Note programmes in place under which bonds in aggregate amounts of up to US$4.5 billion and US$2 billion respectively can be issued. As of 31 December, notes with aggregate nominal values of around HK$24.4 billion and HK$9.5 billion were issued by CLP Power and CAPCO respectively.\n\nAround 62% of financing arranged by CLP's SoC businesses in 2023 was through sustainable financing compared with 68% the previous year. CLP Power and CAPCO had HK$32.2 billion of outstanding sustainable financing at the end of the year including HK$19 billion of CAFF financing, as well as HK$13.2 billion of emission reduction-linked facilities with 14 banks.\n\nCLP China executed a RMB293 million (HK$316 million) onshore non-recourse project loan facility for a solar energy project at a competitive interest rate. The business also lowered the interest rates of non-recourse project loans for three renewable energy projects totalling RMB718 million (HK$774 million).\n\nEnergyAustralia executed a A$630 million (HK$3.3 billion) three-year loan facility with nine banks on competitive terms to refinance an existing facility. In addition, the business extended the tenor of a bank guarantee facility of A$150 million (HK$798 million) by one year to December 2024.\n\nCLP's fixed-rate debt as a proportion of total debt at the end of December was 57% (2022: 52%), excluding perpetual capital securities or 60% (2022: 55%) including perpetual capital securities.\n\n## Navigating geopolitical instability\n\nCLP's prudent financing strategies, underpinned by robust governance and risk management, helped strengthen its capital resources to support the Group's ongoing decarbonisation despite continuing market volatility. This\n\napproach was reflected in the pre-emptive action to complete major financing activities with preferential terms at the end of 2022 and early 2023, as well as the Group's efforts to further diversify financing in terms of capital sources, currencies, debt tenor and instruments.\n\nThe Group maintained a high level of interest rate and foreign currency hedging at commercially acceptable terms to cover committed and highly probable financial obligations, enabling it to withstand financial market volatility and pursue its business objectives. This included the use of natural hedge and approved financial derivative instruments with straightforward, easy-to-understand features that can qualify for effective accounting hedge with no adverse profitand-loss impact to manage obligations and risks.\n\nFor counterparty exposure, CLP transacts only with credible financial institutions and financially sound business counterparts with strong credit ratings. These measures help ensure CLP's businesses do not face undue residual financial or credit risks and give strong grounds for confidence to stakeholders.\n\n## Acting as a trusted partner in the energy transition\n\nCLP continued to engage capital providers on the Group's efforts on decarbonisation. The Asia Investor Group on Climate Change's Asian Utilities Engagement Program recognised the Group's decarbonisation efforts including the commitment to exit coal-fired generation before 2040 and the use of battery storage technology.\n\nDuring COP28, organisations including the Voluntary Carbon Markets Integrity Initiative (VCMI) and the Integrity Council for the Voluntary Carbon Markets (IC-VCM) agreed to increase collaboration on standards for carbon credits and enhance transparency and consistency for the instruments. CLP will consider the use of credible carbon offsets as a last resort to offset emissions in its value chain as the Group remains focused on reducing direct emissions from its operations by transitioning to lower-carbon technologies. CLP supports the efforts of the VCMI and IC-VCM to improve the integrity of voluntary carbon markets. The Group is currently undertaking a review on its carbon market strategy covering a range of factors including market trading opportunities and carbon credit generation from CLP's assets. The review is expected to be completed this year.\n\nEnergyAustralia's Tallawarra B Power Station in New South Wales, which officially opened in February 2024, is Australia's first net-zero emissions gas-fired power station with 100% of direct carbon emissions offset over its operational life. As part of funding arrangements to proceed with the construction of Tallawarra B in 2021, EnergyAustralia will purchase credible carbon offsets for all emissions from the plant.",

It has also turbocharged investment in non-carbon energy as governments and corporations seek alternatives to costly fossil fuels, while consumers reduce their consumption and explore lower-carbon energy use as well as energy-saving tools and technologies.\n\nAs one of the largest energy companies in the Asia Pacific region, CLP has a responsibility to meet rising demand for low-carbon energy and smart energy solutions. As Hong Kong's biggest utility company, CLP Power also has a duty to work closely with the Government to ensure the energy landscape adapts to changing times and provide consumers not only with reliable supply but also products and solutions they need for decarbonisation.\n\nBy responding nimbly and rapidly, CLP can rise to the challenges of uncertain times and generate income by providing innovative products and services including Energy-as-a-Service solutions that enhance energy efficiency. It can also develop smart solutions that have immense potential in Mainland China, Australia and India.\n\nIn the longer term, the electrification of transport and the wider economy open the door to a host of new business streams and opportunities both in Hong Kong and CLP's other markets.\n\n## HK$ 52.9 billion\n\nCLP Power's projected capital expenditure under 2024 - 2028 Development Plan to support Hong Kong's growth\n\n## 70%\n\nYear-on-year increase in sales of Renewable Energy Certificates in Hong Kong in 2023\n\n## CLP China signed\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nto support decarbonisation renewable energy supply contracts with multinational/Hong Kong corporate customers in 2023\n\n4\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nachieve their sustainability goals. Each unit of REC represents the environmental attributes of electricity produced by local renewable energy sources including solar power, wind power and land fill gas generated or purchased by CLP Power. The REC programme has boomed in popularity since its 2018 launch with sales rising 70% year-on-year to more than 170 gigawatt hours (GWh) in 2023. Some large commercial customers including AirTrunk Hong Kong Holding Limited, Citi Hong Kong and Bupa International Ltd. have signed multi-year REC agreements. The REC and FiT programmes enable CLP Power customers to increase renewable energy adoption as part of concerted efforts across society to drive Hong Kong's decarbonisation.\n\nThe popularity of distributed energy resources including rooftop solar systems and EVs is increasing the complexity of electricity supply networks. CLP Power is continuing its smart grid development to support customers' evolving energy needs and improve efficiencies in power network operations, while ensuring the electricity supply remains highly reliable and resilient. Key smart grid initiatives include the continued rollout of the smart meter replacement programme for\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Deploying customer-facing energy solutions\n\nCLP Power serves over 80% of the Hong Kong population, and for generations has provided safe and reliable electricity needed by customers at a reasonable price. Public awareness of the impact of climate change has risen steeply in recent years and customers expect that their electricity comes from cleaner sources, with added services that help them become more energy-efficient.\n\nTo promote the development of renewable energy, CLP Power buys solar or wind energy generated by residential and business customers on their premises. The renewable energy Feed-in Tariff (FiT) scheme allows customers to sell their energy to CLP Power at a rate higher than the normal electricity tariff rate and recover their investment costs in a shorter period. By the end of 2023, 376MW of renewable energy capacity had been approved or connected to the grid, equivalent to the annual energy consumption of around 89,700 households.\n\nCustomers can also buy Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) to support non-fossil fuel energy generation in Hong Kong and",

In 2023, CLP China signed four contracts with prominent companies in the form of power purchase agreements (PPAs) or Green Electricity Certificates to support the low-carbon transformation of a diverse range of industries including commercial real estate, manufacturing and data centres. One of them was a strategic framework agreement with Shui On Xintiandi (Shui On), which invests and manages premium commercial properties in Mainland China. The first initiative is a 10-year PPA which has seen Shui On's Nanjing International Finance Center powered by the electricity generated by CLP China's Yangzhou Gongdao Solar Power Station since the beginning of 2024. The arrangement will lower the commercial and office complex's annual carbon emissions by an estimated 21,000 tonnes, which is equivalent to the carbon sequestration impact of 140 hectares of forest, as well as securing a steady revenue source for CLP China's Yangzhou Gongdao project.\n\nThese partnerships underscore the growing demand for renewable energy from companies in China as the nation's dual carbon goals drive the economy's continuing low-carbon transition. CLP China will continue to expand its investments in renewable energy generation and maintain its strong growth momentum.\n\nEnergyAustralia offered households the chance to reduce emissions with a Solar Home Bundle which provides them with a solar panel and battery system installed and managed with no upfront costs. By the end of 2023, 314 customers had signed up for the service in New South Wales, paying a fixed rate for electricity use and owning their systems outright after seven years. Another programme, PowerResponse, is a voluntary demand response initiative that rewards customers for reducing their electricity use at peak times. Customers who sign up receive notifications to reduce their energy use in return for credits or, if they have a home battery system, to join a PowerResponse Virtual Power Plant.\n\nEnergyAustralia also provided accredited renewable energy to customers under the GreenPower programme supported by the Federal Government which allows commercial and industrial customers to source renewable energy or install solar and battery systems. The InsightsPro data portal gives business customers access to consumption data and carbon\n\nemissions tracking. The ResponsePro programme provides financial incentives for businesses to reduce their energy use at peak periods.\n\nApraava Energy is among the companies taking the lead in India's nascent automated metering infrastructure sector by building smart meter networks that are key to the development of more efficient electricity services for households and businesses. Apraava Energy is supplying more than three million smart meters under two contracts won in the states of Assam and Gujarat in 2023. The meters allow power companies to develop more personalised services for electricity customers and improve energy efficiency.\n\n## Developing Energy-as-a-Service business models\n\nEnergy-as-a-Service business models have become increasingly popular in recent years amid a rising trend for renewable energy and decentralised power generation. CLPe has widened its range of offerings in Hong Kong and Mainland China, generating new revenue streams while providing customers with cost-effective solutions that have no upfront installation costs.\n\nBuildings account for 90% of energy consumption in Hong Kong and offer huge scope for energy saving. CLPe is installing Hong Kong's first chiller system to use zero-carbon electricity at Chinachem Group's Nina Tower hotel and office complex - the tallest building in Hong Kong's New Territories - which will be completed in phases between 2024 and 2027. It has also teamed up with Chinachem and Henderson Land in a 15-year agreement to upgrade and operate a shopping mall's cooling system. CLPe will provide funding along with design and engineering work for the new air-cooled chiller system which is expected to reduce power consumption 15%, or around 500,000 kWh of electricity a year, equivalent to the annual electricity consumption of around 160 three-member households and a reduction of around 200 tonnes of carbon emissions.\n\nCLPe and its partner China Mobile won a tender by MTR Corporation in December to enhance the rail operator's communication systems infrastructure across its network in Hong Kong. CLPe is responsible for engineering, procurement and construction for the project, using China Mobile's 5G technology. CLPe also signed a cooperation framework agreement with a branch of the Zhongshan Municipal",

CLP Power works closely with the Government and the private sector to expand Hong Kong's EV charging infrastructure. It is also supporting trials of electric buses, public light buses, taxis and ferries as Hong Kong moves towards a future of rising demand for EV charging solutions.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nHow can CLP help data centre operators like us become more efficient and sustainable energy users? As more and more data centres are set up in Hong Kong, how can CLP ensure we have a reliable power supply to support our 24/7 operations?\n\nMs Joanne Hon Managing Director, Equinix Hong Kong\n\nHong Kong is home to many regional offices and headquarters and is ideally positioned to serve as a data centre hub for the region. The city offers excellent network connectivity, a dependable electricity supply with reasonable tariffs, a comprehensive data protection ordinance and proximity to Mainland China.\n\nData centres are the backbone of today's digital economy, but the industry is also an intensive user of land, water and energy. As Hong Kong's biggest electricity provider, CLP Power is committed to helping data centre operators become more efficient in their energy use while ensuring they have the highly reliable electricity supply they need.\n\nCLP Power works closely with data centre operators and offers a diverse range of services to help reduce their carbon footprint. Through our Community Energy Saving Fund, we provide funding for universities to conduct energy analysis for high energy consumption businesses such as data centres to improve energy efficiency. The air flow optimisation energy analysis at Equinix's data centre facility is a prime example. By monitoring the temperature in data halls and adjusting the air circulation to prevent excessive power use in data centre cooling, it achieved energy savings of around 30%. The collaboration allows us to validate and endorse some energy saving best practices for the data centre industry. Other services include free energy audits which allow data centre operators to conduct a health check of their energy consumption and identify areas where they can optimise energy use. Our customers can also participate in trials of our new energy-saving products and obtain subsidies to install more energy-efficient lighting and air conditioning.\n\nCLP Power is continuing to invest in electricity infrastructure to support Hong Kong's growth and decarbonisation. We are committed to maintaining our world-class power supply reliability and customer service excellence to meet the evolving energy needs of data centres and provide the digital infrastructure that is critical for Hong Kong's transformation into a smart city.\n\nJoseph Law\n\nManaging Director, CLP Power\n\n<!-- image -->",

To support the Hong Kong Government's EV-charging at Home Subsidy Scheme, CLP Power continued to promote its Eco Charge 2.0 service which offers one-stop technical support and customer service to people seeking funding for EV charging infrastructure in the car parks of private residential blocks. By the end of 2023, CLP Power had completed preliminary assessments for around 92% of 577 applications for Government funding, covering around 136,000 car parking bays.\n\nThe Regalia in Kowloon was the first CLP Power customer to complete the installation of EV charging infrastructure under the scheme in early 2023 with 300 EV-enabled parking spaces. Since then, several private residential estates have also successfully completed similar installations to meet growing EV charging needs. In addition, CLP Power also continues to provide free EV charging throughout its supply area with around 160 chargers.\n\n## Deepening CLP's value proposition with partners\n\nCLP's relationships with governments and regulators are pivotal in an industry that is capital intensive and requires a long investment span. It acts as a trusted partner in every market in which it operates by shaping practices and services that contribute to sound energy policies and laws that balance social, economic and environmental needs.\n\nIn Hong Kong, CLP Power's operations are regulated by the Government under the Scheme of Control (SoC) Agreement which since 1964 has provided stability to allow CLP Power to invest and respond to the changing needs of Hong Kong. The Agreement is renewed periodically to ensure it remains suited to an evolving operating environment. In the current SoC Agreement for 2018 to 2033, for instance, a range of initiatives were introduced to promote renewable energy, including the FiT and REC programmes.\n\nCLP Power presents a Development Plan to the Government every five years for the regulator to review CLP Power's investments. The current Development Plan projects capital expenditure of approximately HK$52.9 billion to 2028 for a range of initiatives to support the Government's policy objectives and the city's accelerating economic development, spurred by infrastructure projects and new industries such as data centres. As a major financial and international trading and logistics hub and home to many regional offices of global\n\ncorporations, Hong Kong has become an increasingly popular location for data centres, which require a highly reliable electricity supply. Based on CLP Power's projection, it aims to provide the power supplies and connections for up to 18 large-scale data centres in the 2024-2028 period covered by the current Development Plan, compared with four in the previous five-year period.\n\nBy working closely with the Government in Hong Kong, CLP can play a major role in shaping the city's low-carbon energy future and drive innovative policies for the electrification, digitalisation and decarbonisation of the economy. Most importantly, having a strong business in its core market gives CLP the experience and resources to explore exciting growth opportunities in markets around the world.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPlease see CEO's Strategic Review on page 16 and Business Resilience on page 72 for further discussions on the Scheme of Control Agreement and the 2024 - 2028 Development Plan.\n\n## Creating new revenue streams as other sectors electrify\n\nClimate change has made the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions urgent, and CLP has accelerated its efforts to help businesses reach their decarbonisation targets. Carbonfree electricity has the potential to significantly cut carbon emissions from sectors such as transport and manufacturing.\n\nCLPe expanded its presence in Mainland China's EV sector through a joint venture with TELD, the nation's largest operator of EV charging services with operations in more than 300 cities and a subsidiary of smart power equipment manufacturer Qingdao TGOOD Electric Company Limited. The joint venture operates 181 charging stations in the south of the country with more than 5,500 chargers in Dongguan, Shenzhen and Zhuhai.\n\nEnergyAustralia has also been increasing the scope of its services to cater to rising demand for EV charging infrastructure. In December, it joined Australia's national body for the electric vehicle industry, the Electric Vehicle Council, which aims to drive investment and accelerate growth in the sector. It earlier signed an agreement with North Queensland's largest tours and charter bus operator Tropic Wings to provide the electrification infrastructure for its multi-depot electric bus charging network. EnergyAustralia will oversee the project, due to be completed by mid-2024, and provide ongoing maintenance and repair services.",

These twin obligations are especially acute at times of volatile oil prices and geopolitical tension when energy companies must balance growing demand with affordability. An unstable world can make business unusually challenging by triggering trade restrictions and supply chain disruption in the short to medium-term and pushing up costs for energy companies.\n\nCLP has been able to withstand the impact of fluctuating fuel prices to a large extent thanks to its stringent cost control measures. While geopolitical uncertainties remain, the organisational agility of CLP gives it a competitive edge and the ability to manage those risks effectively while taking full advantage of the commercial opportunities presented by a rapidly changing business environment.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCLP Power reduced Average Net Tariff by 7.4%\n\nfrom January 2024 and allocated HK$200 million from CLP Community Energy Saving Fund to support underprivileged households\n\n## 187 MW\n\nReduction in peak demand from CLP Power's customers on 26 July 2023 through demand management initiatives\n\n## Providing customers with reliable and reasonably priced energy\n\nThe prices of coal, oil and natural gas fell back from their 2022 peaks but remained high in 2023 compared with levels two years earlier, as CLP continued to focus on ways to reduce electricity cost pressures facing its customers in an inflationary environment. Energy is an essential commodity that should be accessible and reasonably priced for everyone, and CLP made it a priority to support its customers.\n\nIn Hong Kong, CLP Power is committed to supplying electricity to customers with a service that is efficient, reliable, environmentally sound and provided at reasonable cost under the terms of the SoC Agreement with the Government. The company mitigated the impact of fuel cost volatility and eased the tariff pressure on customers in 2023 through a series of measures, including enhancing the efficiency of generation and making the most of existing gas reserves. The launch of the offshore LNG terminal made available a critical new source of natural gas for CLP and joint developer The Hongkong Electric Co., Ltd, giving Hong Kong access to competitively priced, reliable LNG from diverse sources in the global market and enhancing the territory's gas supply security.\n\n320 MW\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCapacity of EnergyAustralia's new Tallawarra B gas-fired power station which provides flexible and reliable energy to homes and businesses during high demand periods\n\nMeanwhile, the import of nuclear power - which has remained relatively stable in price - played a major role in smoothing out price fluctuations. The strategy of using a diversified fuel mix and importing energy from highly reliable zero-emission sources contributed to a 7.4% reduction in the Average Net Tariff for 2024. This included a slight 2.9% upward adjustment in the Average Basic Tariff, which had previously been maintained at the same level for three consecutive years. CLP Power continued with stringent cost controls to ensure its tariffs remained competitive - the 6% increase in Average Basic Tariff between 2005 and 2023 was well below the 60% jump in Hong Kong's Consumer Price Index over the same period.\n\nUnderprivileged families have been hardest hit by the global cost of living crisis, and CLP Power allocated more than HK$200 million from its Community Energy Saving Fund for a series of community support programmes to promote renewable energy, boost the Hong Kong economy and encourage customers to save energy.\n\nEnergyAustralia is equally committed to supporting its customers through turbulent times, especially vulnerable households facing cost of living pressures.

While we have great confidence in the future as Hong Kong recovers from the impact of the pandemic, we are acutely aware that many grassroots households face challenges because of the housing shortage and the high cost of living. That is why support for people in need has always been at the heart of our community initiatives. In 2024, we have again set aside HK$200 million from the CLP Community Energy Saving Fund (CESF) for a range of support programmes.\n\nWhile the Average Net Tariff for 2024 has been reduced by 7.4%, to further ease the burden on underprivileged households, the CESF will provide electricity subsidies of HK$600 to each of 50,000 elderly people, low-income families and people with disabilities, while 20,000 tenants of subdivided units will each receive subsidies of HK$1,000. The new Home Electrical Safety Enhancement for the Underprivileged Programme will see us collaborating with community partners to arrange qualified electricians to inspect and repair the electrical installations of around 2,000 underprivileged families for free to improve their home safety. CLP will also continue to carry out rewiring works for the installation of individual electricity meters in subdivided units.

        "page_content": "## Navigating geopolitical instability\n\nEnergy markets worldwide have been on a roller coaster ride in recent years with the aftermath of the pandemic and war in Ukraine leading to wildly fluctuating oil, gas and coal prices. The turbulence has reverberated across every continent, and CLP has relied on its diversified procurement strategy to avoid the worst of the impact.\n\nA continuous supply of fuel is critical for CLP to sustain a reliable electricity supply to its customers and off-takers, and fuel is the largest single component of the Group's operating expenditure. Security of supply, competitive pricing and environmental performance are therefore key elements in CLP's fuel procurement strategy. The company maintains supply security by adopting a diversified fuel mix, optimising its procurement contracting processes, balancing the use of term and spot contracts and maintaining multiple fuel sources so as not to be reliant on a single source or supplier.\n\nIn Hong Kong, CLP Power has been increasing its use of natural gas in support of the Government's decarbonisation targets as coal-fired generation is phased out, raising the proportion of gas-fired energy generation to around 50% since 2020. A diversity of sources of natural gas ensures security of supply. CLP Power began importing natural gas from the Yacheng gas field off Hainan Island in the South China Sea in 1996, but reserves ran low. In 2013, it started\n\ndrawing supplies through an undersea pipeline connecting the West-East-Pipeline Phase II (WEPII) at Dachan Island in Shenzhen to Black Point Power Station. It started sourcing natural gas from new gas fields in the South China Sea using the existing Yacheng pipeline in 2018.\n\nThe dwindling reserves in the Yacheng gas field and a temporary suspension of supplies from the WEPII in December 2015 highlighted the importance of diverse gas sources for CLP Power and Hong Kong as a whole. It also served to emphasise the need for the new LNG terminal, which has received regular shipments of LNG under a long-term supply contract since it began operations in July 2023.\n\nEnergyAustralia, meanwhile, reduces its exposure to market uncertainties by entering into forward energy contracts for hedging purposes. These contracts fix the wholesale price EnergyAustralia pays for electricity over a period of time regardless of the highs and lows of the spot market, allowing it to have more certainty over wholesale energy costs.\n\nThe amount of coal used by CLP is decreasing but it continues to evaluate its procurement strategy and explore new sources to maintain diversity of supply while improving environmental performance. CLP Power, for instance, buys coal from countries around the world including Australia, the US and Indonesia to avoid overreliance on a single supplier or country and continues to identify new sources.\n\nOver 2.23 million smart meters have now been connected for about 80% of CLP Power's customers.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The flow of international goods and services has also been impacted by labour shortages, depleted inventory levels, material sourcing challenges due to tightened trade regulations, shipping delays and rising logistics costs.\n\nCLP Power has overcome these multi-faceted challenges to remain on track to replace traditional meters with smart meters for all customers by 2025. More than 2.23 million smart meters have now been connected for about 80% of customers after the company dealt with logistic challenges posed by the pandemic, including global chip shortages and shipment delays. CLP Power succeeded by taking a three-pronged approach that reflects the Group's vigilance on issues regarding supply chain resilience: Maintaining a sufficient inventory level, having access to multiple supply sources and forging close collaboration with suppliers.\n\n## Case Study\n\n## Enabling a secure energy transition\n\nThe New South Wales Government has committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 70% by 2035 and reach net zero by 2050. The most highly populated state in Australia is fast-tracking the development of renewable energy, and flexible electricity capacity is key to a secure energy transition.\n\nWhen EnergyAustralia begins operation of Tallawarra B power station, the new fast-start gas-fired plant will play an important role in providing flexible capacity and support the continued growth of intermittent renewable energy in New South Wales.\n\nTallawarra B will deliver around 320MW of dispatchable capacity, enough to power around 180,000 homes and small businesses during peak demand periods, supporting a reliable power supply to the market at times when a lack of natural resources curtail wind and solar energy generation.\n\nIt will be an Australian first, being a net zero emissions gas-fired power station, with 100% of all direct carbon emissions offset over its operational life.\n\nThe use of the latest turbine technology makes Tallawarra B one of Australia's most efficient gas-fired generators, and its climate performance is poised to improve further still. EnergyAustralia aims to install technology to blend gas with up to 5% hydrogen in Tallawarra B's fuel mix by 2025, if hydrogen supplies are adequate.\n\nIn late 2023, EnergyAustralia achieved a successful first fire of Tallawarra B, a key milestone before the plant's final commissioning. The project overcame a series of challenges after starting construction during pandemic-enforced lockdowns in 2021, with progress also disrupted by the financial difficulties of principal project contractor Clough Limited, which went into administration in 2022.\n\nSmart meters provide CLP Power customers access to power consumption data, allowing them to easily manage energy use and offering them the opportunity to take part in energy-saving events. In 2023, 950,000 CLP Power customers with smart meters were invited to save energy by participating in demand management programmes. By making minor adjustments to their consumption behaviour, the participating customers saved 410,000 kilowatt hours (kWh) of electricity - equivalent to a reduction of 160 tonnes of carbon emissions. On the evening of 26 July, one of the hottest days of 2023 when CLP Power reported electricity demand of 7,452MW, demand management programmes for residential and business customers helped trim peak demand which would otherwise have been 187MW higher.

Competition for talented people is intense, and failure to attract and develop people with the skills and capabilities needed in fast-evolving global energy markets, and to provide welcoming, inclusive workforces for them, represent risks to every energy company's long-term prospects. It is also a priority for energy companies to ensure that projects are built and operated safely, that workplace hazards and risks for people are reduced, and that health and wellbeing risks are addressed.\n\nLack of organisational agility poses risks to competitiveness, as new ways of working embracing collaboration, commerciality and creativity are key to technological and service innovation. Lastly, energy companies must ensure that everyone is supported to succeed and thrive during the many changes brought by energy transition in order to meet workforce and community expectations. Managing these risks is essential to building a future-ready workforce to drive sustainable growth.\n\nGroup's total recordable injury rate dropped to\n\n0.18\n\nOver 40\n\nyoung engineers joined CLP's flagship Graduate Trainee programme in 2023, the highest ever intake\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nin 2023 thanks to safety enhancement measures (0.25 in 2022)\n\n## Promoting workplace safety and wellbeing\n\nCLP is committed to the safety of its employees and contractors. The Group further strengthened workplace safety in 2023 based on its multi-year health, safety and environment (HSE) improvement strategy, a comprehensive blueprint that emphasises the importance of a proactive approach to make work processes safer.\n\nReflecting a contemporary approach to safety management, the HSE improvement strategy promotes organisational learning to enhance safety, based on human and organisational performance principles. A series of workshops and communication programmes were arranged for employees to increase their understanding of the principles, which aim to harness the knowledge and experience of the workforce to develop safer working practices. The CLP approach centres around how work is performed in day-to-day operation, moves beyond simply looking at human error as a cause, enabling a better understanding of the more complex latent conditions in the work environment. Additionally, the use of an internal taxonomy helped CLP organise safety information and knowledge more effectively, providing the Group with greater insight to guide employees to focus their learning on safety.\n\nMore than 2,100\n\nstudents have benefitted from the CLP Power Academy since 2017\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTogether with a continued focus on reducing the risks from working at height and falling objects, and a flexibility to adapt the strategy to the specific risk profiles of CLP's businesses in the region, the safety enhancement measures contributed to a decline in the Group's total recordable injury rate (TRIR) and lost time injury rate (LTIR) for employees and contractors, led by significant improvements in Hong Kong and Australia.\n\nCLP received recognition for its efforts to support employee wellbeing during and post-pandemic. CLP Power won the Gold Award for Best Corporate Wellbeing at the annual Best HR Awards organised by recruitment portal CTgoodjobs, and was a Gold award winner in the Mental Health Friendly Supreme Organisation category in the Occupational Health Award organised by Occupational Safety and Health Council. CLP China was a winner at the Wellness Employer Award organised by the bodies including the China Human Resources Management Research Association.",

Hence, the LTIR and TRIR are for work-related injury only starting from 2022. There were 3 work-related recordable ill health injuries (employee only) and 2 recordable commuting injuries in 2023.\n- 3 2023 figures excluded Apraava Energy as CLP ceased to have operational control over the Indian company which became a 50-50 joint venture in 2022.\n\nSadly, a contractor at Apraava Energy's Sidhpur wind farm in the Indian state of Gujarat was killed in an incident involving on-site industrial machinery during construction work in May. A thorough investigation into the incident was conducted and measures were implemented to improve supervision of contractors and strengthen worksite management through increased site audits and training.\n\nEnergyAustralia was charged by WorkSafe Victoria in November for alleged occupational health and safety offences in relation to a fire at Yallourn Power Station in 2021. The fire at Yallourn Coal Transfer Building was extinguished by the correct operation of the plant's automated sprinkler system. No employees or contractors were harmed or present, and there was no risk to the neighbouring community nor any disruption to power generation. EnergyAustralia fully cooperated with WorkSafe Victoria's investigation and proactively made changes to its systems for fire management following the incident.\n\n## Attracting and developing diverse talent and capabilities\n\nThe success of CLP depends on the talent and hard work of the Group's employees and contractors as well as other team members serving its businesses and joint ventures. As well as investing in its people to develop and enhance their capabilities, CLP must attract new talent to seize opportunities and overcome challenges as the global energy market pivots to a low-carbon, digitalised future. The Group must also maintain a strong pipeline of engineering talent so that its deep reserves of skill and expertise can be passed on from one generation of employees to the next.\n\n## Strengthening skills and expertise\n\nCLP further strengthened the recruitment of people with talent and expertise in engineering, digital technologies and customer service in its two core markets. More than 800 people joined CLP's businesses in Hong Kong and Mainland China, sustaining a rapid pace of recruitment. Recruitment was supported through scaling up internal talent acquisition capabilities as well as digitalisation of the candidate experience and building stronger connections to talent sources in Mainland China.\n\nThe highest ever intake of over 40 young engineers joined the company's flagship Graduate Trainee programme in Hong Kong which provides participants with a thorough grounding in core technical, commercial and leadership skills as well as opportunities to work across the Group's business operations in Hong Kong and Mainland China. The programme was bolstered by recruits from Mainland China and overseas universities and is regularly updated to give graduates more",

The new model ensures that the areas of the business closest to customers will have accountability for end-to-end delivery, operational and financial performance, supported by Group Functions in CLP Holdings.\n\nTo set clear expectations of the qualities and skills required for managers at CLP, the Group has a well-established system of leadership competencies. These were updated in 2023 to reflect the capabilities and behaviours required to succeed in the evolving business environment including change management, decision-making under uncertainty and partnering and innovating for value. Updated competencies are being integrated into the Group's employee training and development programmes, as well as performance management.\n\nCLP continued to promote digitalised ways of working to deliver improved experiences and efficiencies for the workforce, and simplify business processes such as finance and human resources management to make them more streamlined and generate greater productivity. CLP is also migrating to new office designs that aim to support improved cooperation and interaction between employees.\n\nCLP continued to invest in training to promote organisational agility. Almost 4,200 Hong Kong employees have been trained in Design Thinking since it was launched in 2019. Design Thinking aims to nurture an innovation culture and helps employees develop problem-solving capabilities and innovative mindsets.\n\nCLP also launched online self-learning courses on robotic process automation (RPA) to show employees how the methodology can improve daily work processes. RPA aims to promote a digital mindset across the organisation, drive productivity gain, enhance customer experience and workforce satisfaction.

Each of these changes alone is significant but combined they have led to a sharp rise in sustainability-related risks and opportunities. Climate change, for example, threatens energy infrastructure and operations, while in the short-term, extreme weather impacts renewable energy assets, in particular hydro power plants. Rising global temperatures meanwhile trigger changes in regulations as governments bring in stricter policies to achieve their climate targets, potentially creating medium- to long-term risk for the energy industry. By contrast, the rapid development of digital technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI) and data analytics tools offers new opportunities for utility companies to improve their operations and customer service. At the same time, every business must remain vigilant against the threat of cyberattacks in an increasingly digitalised world. Balancing these conflicting risks and opportunities calls for vision, strategy and commitment from energy companies to ensure effective and sustained business resilience.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 99.999%\n\nReliability rate achieved by CLP Power in Hong Kong in 2023 (99.997% in 2022)\n\nCLP Power maintained reliable power supply with minimal service interruptions when Hong Kong was hit by Super Typhoon Saola and record rainfall within 1 week\n\n## CLPe opened a new office in Shenzhen's Longhua district\n\nto meet growing demand for sustainable energy solutions in the Greater Bay Area\n\n## Building resilience in the face of climate change and an evolving business environment\n\nCLP invests in energy markets across Asia Pacific with vastly different regulatory requirements, and the Group's overall resilience depends on its ability to anticipate and respond to regional economic and energy policies and market fluctuations. In every market, the Group works closely with policymakers to support their objectives through business activities designed to meet local circumstances. Ongoing engagement with stakeholders is key to building increased understanding of CLP's businesses and the necessary regulatory framework conducive to a healthy energy industry.\n\nIn Hong Kong, CLP Power is regulated by the SoC Agreement with the Government. The SoC framework allows it to plan and invest cost-effectively in line with Hong Kong's long-term development needs while meeting the Government's policy objectives. The arrangement has provided an effective mechanism for CLP Power for 60 years to deliver a world-class electricity supply at a reasonable cost that powers Hong Kong's economic growth and minimises environmental impact.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe SoC Agreement evolves in line with changing regulatory framework and community aspirations through an interim review conducted every five years. An interim review took place in 2023 for the current 15-year SoC Agreement ending in December 2033. CLP Power has agreed with the Government a new incentive and penalty mechanism for large-scale supply interruptions, special tariff relief in the event of future fuel crises and improvements to information transparency.\n\nGovernments worldwide are introducing new regulations and targets to promote the use of non-carbon energy. The Hong Kong Government is committed to achieving carbon neutrality before 2050. To support this, power companies will cease using coal for daily electricity generation by 2035 and increase the ratio of renewable energy in the fuel mix to between 7.5% and 10% by that year, and subsequently to 15%.\n\nHong Kong is densely populated and has limited potential for local renewable energy development. Regional cooperation is therefore crucial to achieve the Government's climate change targets.

CLP, China Southern Power Grid, Companhia de Electricidade de Macau, and China General Nuclear Power Group meanwhile pledged to work more closely together on power supply, sustainable energy and energy storage systems in the Greater Bay Area (GBA) in an agreement reached at the 11 th Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macau Power Industry Summit in Hong Kong in May. The agreement supports the Chinese Government's dual goals of peaking carbon emissions by 2030 and achieving carbon neutrality by 2060.\n\nIn Mainland China, the Government is accelerating reforms of the energy sector aimed at developing a unified national electricity market by harmonising technical standards and trading rules. CLP works closely with local authorities to navigate these dynamic market reforms.\n\nIn Australia, climate-related policies are fast changing, driven by policymakers at the federal and state levels as well as a vast array of government agencies. EnergyAustralia engages in regular dialogues with policymakers and regulators to support the development of a smart, clean energy system in the country. In particular, EnergyAustralia is focused on opportunities in flexible capacity as the phasing out of coal-fired power stations continues and more rooftop solar systems are connected. Two new battery energy storage systems in New South Wales went into service in October to provide EnergyAustralia with 90MW/180MWh of firming capacity under an offtake agreement. The new 320MW Tallawarra B power station will help maintain power supply reliability. EnergyAustralia also made progress on other proposed energy storage projects, including the Wooreen battery system in Victoria and a pumped hydro project in Lake Lyell in New South Wales.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPlease see Transition to Net Zero on page 49 for further information on CLP's strategies to provide low-carbon energy.\n\nWith the development of sustainable energy solutions such as distributed energy systems and BESS, CLP needs to manage increased grid complexities and respond to changing customer needs. To stay on top of evolving market dynamics, CLP is accelerating the development of new energy services and business models to diversify from a traditional energy utility and reposition for success. For example, as customers need new ways to decarbonise their operations and become more sustainable, CLPe is providing solar energy and smart energy solutions, including energy-efficient cooling systems powered by AI, to a growing number of businesses and organisations in Hong Kong and other cities of the GBA.\n\nSolar energy customers for CLPe include the Drainage Services Department (DSD) in Hong Kong. CLPe completed the installation of a floating solar photovoltaic system at DSD's flood prevention project in Tin Shui Wai in the New Territories, with grid connection completed in September. Across the border, CLPe and the Cuiheng Group agreed to cooperate on the development of cooling systems in a new district in the southern city of Zhongshan. CLPe will also work with the Cuiheng Group on distributed solar energy and EV charging infrastructure.\n\nTo serve growing customer needs for sustainable energy solutions in the GBA, CLPe set up a new office in Shenzhen's Longhua district. This followed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) on energy digitalisation signed with the Longhua Government in 2022. Meanwhile, CLPe expanded its collaboration with MTR Shenzhen with the installation of a distributed solar energy system at the rail operator's carriage depot in Longhua, a year after providing a solar system for the company's headquarters in the district.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPlease see Energy Growth Opportunities on page 57 for further information on CLP's new energy services and business models.\n\n## Mitigating extreme weather risks\n\nCLP is an essential service provider and recognises the importance of making sure its infrastructure and operations are resilient to extreme weather events caused by climate change. Despite the growing occurrence of extreme weather events, CLP Power achieved an overall reliability rate of 99.999% in 2023. The Group continues to strengthen planning and mitigation measures to cope with the heightened risks. New technologies offer ways for CLP to better manage power grids and strengthen the resilience of its infrastructure.\n\nA comprehensive assessment of the threat of extreme weather events to generation, transmission and distribution infrastructure in Hong Kong was conducted using weather data and climate models from the Hong Kong Observatory, the International Panel on Climate Change, World Resources Institute and other international groups. The assessment allowed CLP to determine the measures needed to deal with the impact of super typhoons, storm surges, wildfires and other extreme weather events on key energy infrastructure.\n\nCLP's 2024-2028 Development Plan includes funding for projects to strengthen 400kV transmission lines and other network assets against extreme weather events.",

        "page_content": "## Case Study\n\n## Standing strong through superstorms\n\nHong Kong was hit by Super Typhoon Saola and the heaviest rainstorm on record during a single week in September. CLP Power rose to the challenge and maintained a reliable power supply with minimal service interruptions as advanced monitoring and diagnostic systems and effective preventive measures helped ensure the integrity of its power supply system.\n\nSuper Typhoon Saola led to the suspension of most offices and schools across the city. CLP Power's operations remained largely unaffected, though about 18,000 customers suffered service interruptions as strong winds and fallen trees damaged some overhead cables and power supply equipment. Power was swiftly restored for affected customers.\n\nWhen the rainstorm struck days later, CLP Power's electricity supply remained stable as flash floods and landslides affected many parts of the city. Power was restored within hours to around 1,000 customers who suffered interruptions.\n\nIn recent years, CLP Power has reinforced transmission towers and installed anti-flooding equipment at substations. Vegetation near overhead transmission lines is closely monitored and managed and CLP Power uses new technology for the detection and isolation of faulty sections of the network.\n\nCLP Power conducts regular emergency drills and is investing in rapid construction technology to erect temporary masts and shorten the lengths of power interruptions during emergency repairs. The continuing rollout of smart meters for customers, especially in more remote areas, also increases CLP Power's ability to monitor supply interruptions. Flood gates and alarm systems are also being installed at substations to reduce the risk of disruption to the power supply.\n\nHong Kong is a non-stop city that relies heavily on electricity to keep its economy vibrant, making power supply reliability critically important.\n\nCLP Power's engineering team strive to safeguard reliable power supply during adverse weather events to minimise the impact on customers.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "CLP China took steps to reinforce the operational resilience of its renewable energy assets as well as that of new wind and solar farms under development.\n\nThe Bobai wind farm in Guangxi, currently under construction, will have a wind turbine tower capable of withstanding once-in-50 year strong wind speeds. Floodresistant solar panels are meanwhile being installed at the new Yangzhou Gongdao Solar Farm. Solar panels at Jinchang Solar Power Station and other sites are being strengthened to protect them against strong winds.\n\nRobust early warning systems were installed at Huaiji Hydro Power Stations in Guangdong province to guard against flooding while ensuring safe operations during extreme weather. The plant was also modified to ensure it operates reliably in the event of a blackout. CLP China liaised with the local Government and neighbouring communities and conducted training and drills to raise awareness about the risks from flooding.\n\nVolatile weather patterns caused by climate change have disrupted energy supplies worldwide in recent years. Drought conditions in Yunnan province in southwest China led to a reduction in output from Dali Yang\\_er Hydropower Station. Tariffs for electricity dispatched were also below expectations, resulting in a HK$115 million impairment charge for the plant in 2023.\n\n## Reinforcing cyber resilience and data protection\n\nBig data and advances in AI and machine learning technologies have transformed the way the world does business and offers powerful tools for energy companies to improve their operations and customer service. CLP continued to upgrade its data analytics capabilities as part of the Group's ongoing digitalisation efforts.\n\nCLP Power developed a new data analytics tool to enhance the detection of faulty smart meters in customers' homes and businesses, leading to reduced time and manual effort in managing its metering network. The new software can also monitor customers affected by outages during extreme weather events and allow for faster supply restoration.\n\nCLP Power is exploring the use of data analytics to optimise management of electricity assets, fuel purchases and short-term load forecasting, and the use of AI-powered chatbots to support customer services and employee training.\n\nCLP China and Apraava Energy in India continued to benefit from the use of the Group's advanced analytics platform to monitor the operations of renewable energy assets. The system incorporates big data and AI technologies to monitor the performance of wind and solar farms in real time.\n\n## Keeping cybercrime at bay\n\nCybersecurity threats have become greater and more complex as energy markets are reshaped by new digital technologies.\n\nCLP set up new governance systems in 2023 to establish the roles and responsibilities for cybersecurity of all business departments across the Group, based on guidelines from the National Institute of Standards and Technology in the US.\n\nA new security operations centre was established in Hong Kong to step up monitoring of cybersecurity risks and strengthen response to incidents. The Group continued to deploy new technologies to counter online threats and provided training to employees to increase their awareness of cybercrime.",

In addition to CLP's commitment to net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, CLP has been strengthening its efforts to cut air pollution and improve water and waste management through a comprehensive environmental strategy that encompasses every aspect of its operations.\n\nThe Group set ambitious new targets in 2023 for reductions in air emissions, water use and waste generation. The updated targets for 2025 and 2030 were calibrated to reflect the decline of coal-fired power in CLP's asset portfolio, and affirm the Group's commitment to ongoing improvement in environmental performance.\n\n## Air emissions management\n\nCLP uses a combination of a managed fuel mix and advanced technologies to limit air emissions. The Group cut emissions of nitrogen oxides (NO x ), sulphur dioxide (SO 2 ) and particulate matter (PM) in 2023 by 26%, 17% and 1% respectively compared with the previous year. The divestment of a majority stake in Fangchenggang Power Station in Mainland China contributed to the reductions, while emissions from India's Jhajjar Power Station were excluded as Apraava Energy is no longer a subsidiary.\n\nTargets for 2025 and 2030 were set to guide further improvements in the Group's performance on reducing air emissions. The table below is a summary of the Group's targets and air emissions performance.\n\n|                | 2023 Performance     | 2023 Performance      |               |               |\n|----------------|----------------------|-----------------------|---------------|---------------|\n|                | Reduction  from 2022 | Reduction  from 2021* | 2025  Target* | 2030  Target* |\n| NO x  emission | -26%                 | -29%                  | -20 to -30%   | -50%          |\n| SO2 emission   | -17%                 | -23%                  | -15 to -20%   | -55%          |\n| PM emission    | -1%                  | -12%                  | -10 to -15%   | -90%          |",

        "page_content": "NO x emissions will be further reduced at Black Point Power Station in Hong Kong when the new D2 gas-fired generation unit goes into service, thanks to its use of selective catalytic reduction technology. The same system has effectively controlled NO x emissions at the adjacent D1 unit since its introduction in 2020.\n\nEnergyAustralia will use a plume dispersion device to manage exhaust gases from the new Tallawarra B power station in New South Wales when it enters service. The device helps cool exhaust gases from the gas turbine to slow the column of hot air rising from the power station, eliminating any safety threat to flights in and out of nearby Shellharbour Airport.\n\nTwo short-term carbon monoxide (CO) licence limit exceedances were recorded at EnergyAustralia's power plants in Victoria in 2023. The first exceedance occurred during an emissions test at Jeeralang Power Station. The other occurred during a recommissioning run after an outage at Newport Power Station. Both incidents were reported to the local authorities and no further regulatory action was taken.\n\nYallourn Power Station recorded a minor environmental licence breach related to coal dust control. EnergyAustralia reported the case to the Environment Protection Authority in Victoria and updated its internal risk management and monitoring system. The authority deemed the response from EnergyAustralia appropriate and the case has been closed.\n\n## Water management\n\nCLP strives to reduce the amount of freshwater used for its operations, and manage the impact of new energy projects on water systems. Freshwater consumption decreased by 62% compared with the previous year, following the divestment of Fangchenggang Power Station in 2022. Since Apraava Energy has ceased to be a subsidiary of CLP, water consumption of the operator of the coal-fired Jhajjar Power Station was no longer included. In 2023, the Group set targets for reduction in water consumption by 2025 and 2030. The below table is a summary of freshwater consumption performance and targets for 2025 and 2030.\n\n|                        | 2023 Performance     | 2023 Performance      |               |               |\n|------------------------|----------------------|-----------------------|---------------|---------------|\n|                        | Reduction  from 2022 | Reduction  from 2021* | 2025  Target* | 2030  Target* |\n| Freshwater consumption | -62%                 | -71%                  | -45% to -55%  | -85%          |\n\nBlack Point Power Station in Hong Kong completed a project to expand the capacity of its water treatment plant and increase its water processing efficiency. CLP Power also installed more rainwater harvest systems at its substations to reduce freshwater consumption, including water recycling tanks and automatic drip irrigation systems.\n\nCLP China continued to implement robotic systems in its solar energy plants to reduce freshwater use through the automatic cleaning of photovoltaic panels.\n\nEnergyAustralia conducted an investigation into the underlying geology and possible impact on groundwater from its proposed Lake Lyell pumped hydro project in New South Wales. The investigation results will be included in an environment impact study (EIS) for the project, which would involve a purpose-built upper reservoir to store excess energy.\n\nMost of CLP's thermal power generation plants use seawater for cooling, including Black Point Power Station and Castle Peak Power Station in Hong Kong and Australia's Tallawarra Power Station and Newport Power Station. Where seawater cooling is not feasible, CLP strives to minimise its freshwater use and adopt water recirculation processes. The quantity of water withdrawal and discharge depends on electricity generation volumes, and CLP takes steps to ensure the quality of water discharge meets regulatory standards.",

Despite the logistical challenges of the pandemic, the project maintained an exemplary environmental record throughout 31 months of construction.\n\nThe project was subjected to extensive environmental assessments and stringent regulatory requirements before construction began in the southwest waters of Hong Kong, which are a habitat for marine species including Chinese white dolphins and finless porpoises.\n\nMitigation steps included the use of noise reduction systems and the implementation of marine mammal exclusion zone monitoring during piling works for the terminal's marine jetty. Tests during construction and after the start of operations in 2023 found no deterioration in water quality while the marine mammal population has remained stable.\n\nA stakeholders liaison group comprising academics and marine conservation and fisheries experts, along with representatives of fishermen's associations and the community, was set up in September 2020 and meets regularly to discuss environmental issues.\n\nCLP Power and Hongkong Electric also set aside HK$100 million to establish two funds to support environmental enhancement initiatives for marine ecology and conservation and sustainable development of the fishing industry. The Marine Conservation Enhancement Fund supports initiatives for the conservation and enhancement of the marine habitat, including initiatives on eco-tourism and education. The Fisheries Enhancement Fund meanwhile pays for enhancements to fisheries resources and sustainable fisheries development, as well as fisheries-related education and tourism.\n\n## Waste management\n\nWaste products from the Group's operations decreased 68% compared with 2022, as year-earlier data included waste from Fangchenggang Power Station and Jhajjar Power Station, and both plants were no longer accounted for in 2023 due to divestments.\n\nCLP is committed to minimising material use and waste disposal, and stepped up recycling efforts in line with circular economy principles. Across the Group's operations, major operational recyclable waste products including scrap metals, scrap rechargeable batteries, waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) and inert construction waste were fully recycled in 2023.\n\nThe Group continued to recycle coal ash and gypsum, the main by-products of coal-fired power operations, for use in other industries including construction.\n\nIn 2023, the Group set waste reduction targets for 2025 and 2030. Key waste management performance and targets are summarised in the table below.\n\n|                  | 2023 Performance     | 2023 Performance      |               |               |\n|------------------|----------------------|-----------------------|---------------|---------------|\n|                  | Reduction  from 2022 | Reduction  from 2021* | 2025  Target* | 2030  Target* |\n| Waste products # | -68%                 | -71%                  | -65%          | -70%          |\n\n- # Waste products include total waste produced from operation & maintenance activities and by-products produced by the coal-fired power plants\n- * Compared to baseline level of 2021",

These include our continuing efforts to gradually refresh our Board and Board Committees; implementing the findings from our last External Board Review exercise as well as keeping the market duly updated on the significant developments concerning the Group. Our commitment to these important initiatives is only possible with the support from the Board and the management leadership team.\n\nIn relation to the gradual refresh of our Board, work on this is continuing through to 2024 and we have commenced the search for a new Independent Non-executive Director with particular strength and experience on Audit & Risk Committees of comparable listed companies.\n\nIt would be remiss on our part not to thank former and outgoing Directors for their years of service and invaluable contributions to the Board and CLP. These include Mrs Fanny Law who retired at the 2023 AGM, Mrs Zia Mody and Mr Richard Lancaster who will be retiring at the 2024 AGM and Mr J.A.H. Leigh who will retire in March 2024.\n\nIn preparing for 2024, an important work involving our Board Members is the Group strategy review. Preparatory work on this has commenced with a series of business unit and strategy updates having been made to the Board during the second half of 2023.\n\nThe level of regulatory oversight of sustainability is expected to increase and a key aspect of this is the reporting on sustainability. Building on the double materiality methodology approach that we have adopted in our sustainability reporting, the 'financially material' topics will be the focus of our sustainability reporting in this year's Annual Report.\n\n2023 has been a year of transition for CLP as we navigate through the challenges, risks and opportunities for our Group's businesses. This is another good reminder that our corporate governance practices will need to evolve to ensure that they remain fit for purpose consistent with our shareholders' expectations whilst being guided by our culture of 'doing the right things right'.",

        "page_content": "## 2023 At a Glance\n\n## Board Succession\n\n- At the beginning of 2023, we welcomed the appointment of Mrs Betty Yuen as a Non-executive Director and the appointment of Mr Andrew Brandler as the Vice Chairman of the Board both of which took effect on 1 January 2023.\n- In June 2023, we announced the succession plans for CLP Holdings CEO and Mr T.K. Chiang's appointment on the Board took effect on the same date as he became CEO on 1 October 2023. As part of the CEO transition, our former CEO Mr Richard Lancaster remained on the Board as an Executive Director and he will step down from all his positions with CLP at the conclusion of the 2024 AGM.\n- Ms Wang Xiaojun Heather was appointed as an additional Independent Non-executive Director in May 2023. In considering Ms Wang's appointment, the Nomination Committee recognised her extensive experience in human resources at the executive leadership level and that her skills, experience and background are well aligned with the Board's focus on organisational talent capability.\n\n## Board Committees Refresh\n\n- The beginning of the year 2023 saw Mr Andrew Brandler took up the Chair position of the Finance & General Committee, Ms May Siew Boi Tan became the Chairperson of the Audit & Risk Committee and Mr Chunyuan Gu also joined the Human Resources & Remuneration Committee.\n- Ms Wang Xiaojun Heather joined the Audit & Risk Committee and the Human Resources & Remuneration Committee in May when she joined the Board.\n- The Sustainability Committee was reconstituted during the year with the appointment of Independent Non-executive Director Mr Chunyuan Gu as the Chairman of the Sustainability Committee on 1 October. The Committee became a Non-executive Directors and Independent Non-executive Directors only Committee with effect on 1 January 2024. Management Committee Members stepped down from the Committee and the terms of reference also provided that the composition will comprise Non-executive Directors only with at least three Independent Non-executive  Directors.\n- On 1 October 2023, Mr Andrew Brandler also joined the Human Resources & Remuneration Committee as a Member.\n\n## Implementing Findings from Board Review\n\n## Governance Oversight Key Announcements\n\n- Two key initiatives were implemented from the 2022 External Board Review findings.\n- Management Briefing sessions for the Board were introduced in 2023 and a total of 16 sessions were held during the year with a high level of attendance by Directors. The schedule of sessions with selected topics were provided to Directors in advance. The Directors' attendance at these sessions were optional and depending on their interest and availability, Directors would be able to decide which session they would like to attend. The topics covered at the Management Briefing sessions included business unit updates and key group functional updates.\n- CLP Holdings Board Committee Chairs' updates to the CLP Holdings Board at Board meetings were introduced as a new standing agenda item for the Board meetings. The Committee Chairmen's update enabled Board Members to be briefed on matters of significance that were considered by the relevant Committees since the last Board meeting. This also had the effect of highlighting certain key issues to the Board's attention and assisting the Board to focus its discussion on the pertinent issues.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- There were a number of material developments for the Group in 2023 which the Board exercised oversight of. We announced these to the market contemporaneously ensuring that the market is duly updated of these material developments. Highlights of these are set out below.\n- CEO transition - The Board had been involved in the succession planning and approval for the CEO transition as well as the communications plan for the transition. The announcement for the transition was made in June and covered the transitional arrangements and appointments.\n- Key developments for the Hong Kong Scheme of Control (SoC) Business - We issued an announcement in November which covered three important developments for the Hong Kong SoC Business as these were approved and agreed with the Hong Kong Government. These related to the Development Plan (2024-2028), the tariff for 2024 and the outcome from the Interim Review of the SoC.\n- Profit warning - The Company made an announcement in January 2024 regarding the expected impairment of goodwill of EnergyAustralia's Customer business. The announcement of the expected impairment was based on management's preliminary assessment ahead of the formal results announcement for 2023. Given the impact, the announcement was made to inform the market on a timely basis and considering the size of the expected impairment, we also announced the expected total operating earnings and total earnings for 2023 based on the management accounts.",

The model letter is on our website and deals with a range of matters regarding a Director's appointment and responsibilities including an expected level of time commitment.\n- We have a set of bespoke Onboarding Guidelines for Directors with the key objective of assisting new Directors in their understanding of CLP's business, governance and Board and Committee dynamics. The Guidelines are available on the CLP website.\n\n## Our disclosure\n\n- The CLP Fair Disclosure Policy sets out the principles for the broad and non-exclusionary distribution of information to the public.\n- The Continuous Disclosure Obligation Procedures guide the organisation in monitoring and disclosing potential inside information.\n- The Continuous Disclosure Committee conducts regular assessment of potential inside information.\n- We adopt a double materiality methodology to identify and report the sustainability-related issues that are financially material to us.\n- We disclose our Senior Management's confirmation of compliance with the Listing Rules Model Code and CLP Code for Securities Transactions, in addition to similar disclosures by our Directors.\n- We issue individual Board Committee reports in our Annual Report for the Audit & Risk Committee, Sustainability Committee, Nomination Committee and Human Resources & Remuneration Committee.\n- Our Risk Management Report in the Annual Report sets out CLP's risk management framework and how CLP manages the Group's material risks.\n- We announce our financial results within two months after the end of the financial year. The Annual Report is available on our website within the following fortnight with hardcopies sent to shareholders about two weeks after that.\n- We have published CLP's Climate Vision 2050 since 2007 which sets out the blueprint of CLP's latest decarbonisation actions and with targets updated at regular intervals.\n- We disclose on our website minutes of our AGM; in addition, any questions or topics that are not specifically addressed at the AGM, full answers are provided and disclosed.\n\n<!-- image -->",

An important aspect of this is ensuring that our employees maintain a good understanding of CLP's culture and values.\n- We have a CLP Procurement Values and Principles. This explains our procurement values and principles and we encourage all suppliers to abide by the same values and principles as ourselves, and to adopt the same standards of integrity and transparency in doing business with us.\n- General Representation Letters are issued by our CEO and CFO to the Audit & Risk Committee as attestation of compliance.\n- Our Audit & Risk Committee regularly examines the audit activity reviews conducted by the Internal Auditors. The Internal Auditors highlight the significant events and findings which require the Committee's attention and further examination, where appropriate.\n- Members of our Audit & Risk Committee conduct meetings as between Members only prior to the full Committee meeting attended by management and the auditors; two of which are joined by the independent auditor.\n- For the Group's continuing connected transactions (CCTs), we engage the Company's independent auditor, PwC, to undertake an agreed-upon procedures (AUP) engagement on the Group's CCTs pricing policies.

CLP deviates from only one recommended best practice in the Corporate Governance Code - that an issuer should announce and publish quarterly financial results.\n\n## Our Considered Reasons for not Issuing Quarterly Financial Results\n\nWhile CLP does issue quarterly statements which set out key financial and business information such as electricity sales, dividends and progress in major activities, we do not issue quarterly financial results for the following considered reasons:\n\n- they do not bring significant benefits to our shareholders;\n- they encourage a short-term view of the Company's business performance;\n- CLP's activities do not run and need not be disclosed and judged on a three-month cycle; and\n- preparation of quarterly reports is costly, including the opportunity cost of Board and management time spent on quarterly reporting.",

The Directors' Report includes the 'Board's Statement on Sustainability', which explains the Board's oversight of sustainability-related issues and how CLP approaches and manages the sustainability-related topics (page 175).\n- Sustainability governance has been embedded in our corporate governance structure throughout the Group. Set out below is CLP's Sustainability Governance Structure.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- As one of the Board-level Committees, the Sustainability Committee has a primary role in overseeing the management of the Group's sustainability issues and is supported by the management-level Sustainability Executive Committee. As an oversight role, the Sustainability Committee was reconstituted with changes introduced in 2023 and is now chaired by an Independent Non-executive Director and comprises Non-executive Directors only, with five Independent Non-executive Directors including the Chairman. The Audit & Risk Committee, meanwhile, ensures appropriate assurance of the ESG data.\n- Further information about CLP's sustainability management approach and how progress on sustainability-related goals and targets are reported and reviewed can be found in the Delivering Our Sustainability Agenda chapter, Risk Management Report, the Sustainability Committee Report and the Directors' Report of this Annual Report, as well as in the Sustainability Report published online at the same time as this Annual Report.\n\n## Reporting Principles & Boundaries\n\n- Materiality - Since 2018, materiality assessments have been carried out on the basis of examining how megatrends could impact the success of CLP's strategy in the medium- to long-term. In 2023, CLP provided a more detailed description of its sustainability-related impacts, risks and opportunities (IROs), and for the first time this process was reviewed and assured by CLP's non-financial auditor.\n- Quantitative and Consistency - CLP's sustainability-related disclosures follow guidelines and recommendations from the SASB Standards for Electric Utilities & Power Generators, the Hong Kong Stock Exchange's Environmental, Social and Governance Reporting Guide (ESG Reporting Guide) and the Global Reporting Initiative Reporting Standards (GRI Universal Standards 2021).\n\nIFRS S1 /  TNFD - CLP also makes reference to emerging disclosure standards including International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) S1 - General Requirements for Disclosure of Sustainability-related Financial Information and the recommendations of the Task Force on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD).",

Greenhouse gas emissions are reported with reference to World Resources Institute's (WRI) Greenhouse Gas Protocol.\n\n- Boundaries - As our business needs and focus evolve, scenarios may arise where our previously defined reporting scope was not able to fully capture the material impacts of our overall portfolio, and to better reflect these impacts, selected reporting scopes will be adjusted in different aspects. In 2023, assets added to the reporting scope included the Bobai wind farm, Hong Kong LNG Terminal Limited, Darlington Point Energy Storage and Riverina Energy Storage System II. Apraava Energy ceased to be a subsidiary from December 2022 and is now accounted for as a joint venture.

Our materiality assessment process enabled management to determine which material topics are likely to affect the Group's cash flows, access to finance or cost of capital in the short, medium and long term (financial materiality). Accordingly, the financial effects of those topics are disclosed in the Annual Report. Further information is in the Delivering Our Sustainability Agenda chapter on page 40.\n- Topics with material impact to the nature and a wide range of stakeholders namely, customers, people, business partners and communities are discussed in CLP's online Sustainability Report. It is published at the same time as the Annual Report and captures in detail the Company's delivery of social and environmental value in a rapidly changing environment. In addition, data related to financially material and impact material priorities are set out in the Five-year Summary on page 286.\n- With stakeholders' increasing interest in CLP's response to climate change and its impact on business, we have recently updated CLP's Climate Vision 2050 standalone publication and this includes detailed discussion of our updated decarbonisation targets and transition plans. Key climate-related metrics are also included in the Annual Report and Sustainability Report.\n- The table below sets out the financially material topics by reference to the aspects in the ESG Reporting Guide and discussions and data on these topics can be found in the corresponding chapters of this Annual Report. Aspects A3 (The Environment and Natural Resources) and B8 (Community Investment) in the ESG Reporting Guide are regarded as impact material priorities and these are discussed primarily in the Sustainability Report and are also covered in the 'Five-year Summary: CLP Group Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) Data' (page 288) of the Annual Report.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Environmental\n\n## A1.

Our Directors Development Programme includes:\n\n- A -   reading regulatory and industry related updates\n- B -meeting with local management and stakeholders, and visiting CLP's facilities and special projects with CLP's involvement; and\n- C -attending expert briefings / seminars / conferences relevant to the business or director's duties. In addition, they have access to Chatham House (a leading independent policy institute based in London) publications and the opportunity to attend Chatham House events on topics relevant to our business.\n\n## Onboarding for new Director\n\nThe Company has in place a set of Onboarding Guidelines with the key objective of assisting new Director in understanding of CLP's business, governance and Board and Committee dynamics. This sets out a structured onboarding process that would serve as a roadmap for new Director to gain a better understanding of CLP and our business environment.\n\nOur Onboarding Programme for the newly appointed Director is individually designed with the specific Director in mind having regard to the Director's unique background, skills, experience and perspective. Components of our Onboarding Programme include:\n\n- an introduction session;\n- face-to-face and one-on-one meetings with the Chairman of the Board, Chairman of the Board Committees and the Senior Management who work closely with the Board and Board Committees;\n- access to information that provides a broad overview of the CLP Group;\n- invitation to attend Board Committee meetings to assist with the understanding of the work carried out by various Board Committees; and\n- visits to the major facilities of CLP and / or special projects with CLP's involvement.\n\nAs part of the onboarding sessions for the newly-appointed Independent Non-executive Director, Ms Wang Xiaojun Heather met with some of the Senior Management members and visited CLP facilities during August to October 2023 including visiting facilities in Mainland China and Australia and met with the operational management team.\n\n## Directors' Time and Directorship Commitments\n\nOur Directors, Non-executive Directors in particular, have demonstrated a strong commitment to the CLP Board affairs and they are well aware that they are expected to have a sufficient time commitment to the Board. Directors have given certain confirmations and made disclosures about their other commitments.\n\n## Sufficient time and attention\n\n- Directors have confirmed that they have given sufficient time and attention to the affairs of the Company for the year.\n\n## Other offices and commitments\n\n- Directors disclose to the Company twice a year the number, identity and nature of offices held in Hong Kong or overseas listed public companies and organisations and other significant commitments, together with an indication of the time involved.\n\n## Other directorships\n\n- None of our Directors, individually, held directorships in more than seven public companies (including the Company) as at 31 December 2023.\n\nOur Executive Directors do not hold directorship in other public companies; however, they are encouraged to participate in professional, public and community organisations.\n\nIn respect of those Directors who stand for election or re-election at the 2024 AGM, all their directorships and board committee membership held in listed public companies in the past three years are set out in the Notice of AGM. Other details of the Directors' biographies are set out under Board of Directors on page 82 of this Annual Report and on CLP website.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The report and the recommendations for this External Board Review exercise had been put to the Chairman and the Board for consideration and was adopted at the Board meeting held in May 2023. Consistent with the approach taken in the previous review, the focus of this exercise was on today and the future for the Board and the Group with specific objectives on enhancing the alignment on strategic issues, priorities and the path forward; and how the Board adds value in partnership with the management team.\n\n## The Process\n\n- one-on-one dialogues with members of the Board of Directors;\n- one-on-one dialogues with selected members of the executive management team; and\n- a review of previous Strategy & Board papers and selected Board Committee papers.\n\n## Focus of the 2022 Board Review\n\n## Role of the Board & where we spend our time\n\nWhat priorities should we focus on / where should we spend our time to maximise our value add?\n\n## Board & Committee Processes & Structure\n\nHow do we ensure highly effective & efficient CLP Board & Committee practices & processes to drive where we spend our time, information sharing & decision making?\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nValue Add on Key Strategic Issues\n\nEnhancing alignment on Strategic Issues, Priorities and the Path Forward\n\nEnhancing how the Board adds value in partnership with the management team\n\nThis exercise identified key signature strengths of the CLP Board including i) the Board culture continues to reflect the Chairman's values; ii) the evolution of the Board composition has continued; iii) the Board now has a greater focus on critical issues underpinning CLP's future success and iv) the CLP Board continues to do an effective job in delegating key work to Board Committees.\n\nAs with the previous practice, a summary report had also been made available on our website.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Current & Future Board Composition\n\nHow does CLP's Board Composition continue to evolve to ensure we have the required capabilities to add value on current and emerging strategic issues?\n\n## Board Culture & Partnership with Management\n\nHow do we maximise the effectiveness of CLP's Board as a team AND form a 'critical friend' partnership with management via a culture founded on trust, open discussions & debate?",

With a view of achieving these objectives, a number of initiatives and actions were taken during 2023:\n\n- the appointment of Ms Wang Xiaojun Heather as an Independent Non-executive Director with specific experience in organisation talent management and development in international markets and in Mainland China;\n- Directors' visit to the Group's operations and facilities were recommenced;\n- the introduction of the Management Briefing sessions for the Directors;\n- the Finance & General Committee received a more regular update on the business units' strategy;\n- preparatory work for the 2024 Group strategy review had commenced;\n- the Sustainability Committee was repositioned with a stronger focus on the strategy for sustainability; and\n- the Board received updates from each of the Board Committee Chairmen at every Board meeting.\n\n## Nomination and Appointment of Directors\n\nFollowing the Nomination Committee's recommendations, the Board considered and appointed two new Directors in 2023: Ms Wang Xiaojun Heather as an Independent Non-executive Director; and Mr T.K. Chiang as an Executive Director. Mrs Betty Yuen's appointment as a Non-executive Director took effect on 1 January 2023 and the Board had considered her appointment in 2022.\n\n## Independent Non-executive Director Appointment\n\nFor the search process in the lead up to the appointment of Ms Wang Xiaojun Heather as an Independent Non-executive Director, CLP followed a formal and transparent procedure and is guided by CLP's Nomination Policy, which is disclosed in the Nomination Committee Report on page 153.\n\n## Executive Director Appointment\n\nThrough an extensive CEO succession planning process, Mr T.K. Chiang was identified as the CEO successor to Mr Richard Lancaster and the appointment as the CEO and an Executive Director was approved by the Board. The process was conducted with the active engagement and inputs from Members of the Nomination Committee as well as the Non-executive Directors.",

During the Period, our Board size increased from 14 to 15 due to the appointment of one additional Executive Director.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Board Expertise\n\nTo ensure the Board continues to

We believe that this is an important balancing act of bringing experienced Directors with fresh ideas and experience aligned with CLP's strategic priorities and ensuring that the Board remains well represented by Directors with a good degree of CLP corporate knowledge, background and history. The diagram below shows how the Board has been refreshed over the past five years.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Disclosure of Conflict of Interest and Independence of Directors\n\n## Conflicts\n\nDirectors are requested to declare their and their connected entities' direct or indirect interests, if any, in proposals or transactions to be considered by the Board at Board meetings and withdraw from the meetings as appropriate. In addition, where there are actual or potential conflict of interests, restrictions on access to agenda materials will be put in place. In 2023, none of the Directors were required to withdraw from Board meetings in these circumstances.\n\nThe Company follows guidelines at each financial reporting period to obtain confirmations from Directors in respect of any transactions of the Company or its subsidiaries which are related to Directors or their connected entities.\n\nIn addition, identified significant related party transactions are disclosed in Note 32 to the Financial Statements.\n\n## Independence\n\nFor the year ended 31 December 2023, the Company received written confirmations from all of the Independent Non-executive Directors regarding the independence of each of them and their immediate family members.\n\nAmong the Independent Non-executive Directors of the Company, none of them has held cross-directorship with other Directors.\n\n## Our view on independence\n\nThe Company maintains the view that a Director's independence is a question of fact and this is formally recognised in the Board Diversity Policy. The Board is committed to assessing this on an ongoing basis with regard to all relevant factors concerned, including the ability to continually provide constructive challenge for management and other Directors; to express one's own views independent of management or other fellow Directors; and the gravitas inside and outside the boardroom. These attributes and desired behaviour have been demonstrated by our Independent Non-executive Directors as circumstances require.",

All Directors have confirmed, following specific enquiry by the Company, that throughout the year ended 31 December 2023 they have complied with the required standard set out in the Model Code and the CLP Code for Securities Transactions. The CLP Code for Securities Transactions is largely based on the Model Code set out in Appendix C3 of the Listing Rules and is on terms no less exacting than those in the Model Code.\n\n## Management and Staff\n\nCLP recognises the importance of diversity not just at the Board level but throughout the CLP Group. Our respect for people and diversity are embedded in CLP's Code of Conduct and our Board Diversity Policy has also incorporated the CLP Group Diversity and Inclusion Policy for Senior Management and Staff.\n\nOne of the key tasks of CLP's management and staff is the successful implementation of strategy and direction as determined by the Board under the leadership of our Chairman. This includes promoting and 'living' the good corporate culture set by our Board over the years. In doing so, they must apply business principles and ethics which are consistent with those expected by the Board, CLP's shareholders and other stakeholders, and these have been documented in our Code of Conduct.\n\nA key fundamental feature of CLP's corporate governance is a culture of 'doing the right things right', this 'tone' is set at the top of the organisation at the Board level and is embedded throughout our Value Framework, Code of Conduct, CLP Code and the Whistleblowing Policy.\n\n## Subsidiary Board Governance\n\nThe subsidiary board governance plays an important part to ensure that at the management level, the culture set at the Holdings Board level is observed and followed and that the expected standard of business principles and ethics will be consistently applied at the subsidiary board and management level. A number of the subsidiary board positions are taken up by our mid-management leaders where their legal responsibilities at the subsidiary board level are aligned with their accountability in their business or functional capacity.\n\nThe mid-management subsidiary directors are of a certain level of seniority who are familiar with the CLP culture and have a solid understanding of their obligations and responsibilities as a corporate director and an organisational leader. These subsidiary level directors are expected to lead by example and help guide and oversee our people to ensure that the right culture is not just observed but is applied in how we conduct our business.",

The e-training focused on the importance of identifying different forms of potential fraud, and on how CLP staff can prevent, detect, respond to, and report cases of fraud.\n\nWe have also launched e-learning programmes on CLP Corporate Governance Framework and Internal Controls to reiterate the basic governance framework, principles and standards required for an effective system of management controls.\n\nAll the above-mentioned e-training are available on the CLP intranet for staff to understand, learn and refresh anytime as they see appropriate.",

We believe a diverse workforce and an inclusive culture supports high performance and CLP's ability to operate effectively in the many communities in which it operates. CLP has set targets to encourage more women into the workforce, and policies to support employees to balance work and home-life commitments. Considering the nature of our business and the markets we operate in, addressing gender diversity is a Group-wide priority to ensure a sustainable workforce and to deliver a wider, positive social and economic contribution. Long-term aspirational Group-wide gender diversity targets have been set, reflecting UN Sustainable Development Goals, these are:\n\n- Women in Leadership target: to achieve gender balance in leadership positions by 2030 against a 2016 baseline of 22%; and\n- Women in Engineering target: for 30% of engineers to be female by 2030 compared to a 2016 baseline of 9%.\n\nAs indicated in the table on page 71, the gender diversity across the Group for 2023 has been largely consistent with that of 2022. The Group is committed to promoting diversity and inclusion across the organisation.\n\n## Shareholders Engagement\n\n## Shareholding as at 31 December 2023\n\n| Size of Registered  Shareholding   | No. of  Shareholders   |   % of  Shareholders | No. of  Shares   |   % of Issued  Share  Capital |\n|------------------------------------|------------------------|----------------------|------------------|-------------------------------|\n| 500 or below                       | 2,468                  |                13.78 | 759,220          |                          0.03 |\n| 501 - 1,000                        | 3,372                  |                18.83 | 2,704,332        |                          0.11 |\n| 1,001 - 10,000                     | 8,175                  |                45.64 | 34,392,906       |                          1.36 |\n| 10,001 - 100,000                   | 3,459                  |                19.31 | 99,708,528       |                          3.95 |\n| 100,001 - 500,000                  | 366                    |                 2.04 | 73,875,433       |                          2.92 |\n| Above 500,000                      | 72  1                  |                 0.4  | 2,315,010,151    |                         91.63 |\n| Total                              | 17,912 2               |               100    | 2,526,450,570 3  |                        100    |\n\nNotes:\n\n- 1 Information on the 10 largest registered shareholders in the Company is set out on our website.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 2 Actual number of investors is much greater as many shares are held through intermediaries including Central Clearing and Settlement System of Hong Kong (CCASS).\n- 3 55.90% of all our issued shares were held through CCASS.\n- 4 The Listing Rules required 25% public float was maintained throughout the year and up to 26 February 2024.\n\nThe scale of our shareholders' investment is reflected in the market capitalisation of CLP Holdings which stood at HK$163 billion as at 31 December 2023.\n\n<!-- image -->",

CLP's Dividends Policy, adopted by the Board in February 2019, aims to provide reliable and consistent ordinary dividends with steady growth when supported by our earnings whilst ensuring that a solid financial position can be maintained to fund our business growth. In line with our established practice, our ordinary dividends are paid four times a year in each of the quarters. CLP's Dividends Policy is available on the CLP website.\n\nThe Company's performance- and dividend-related dates for 2024 are set out in Information for Our Investors on page 302.\n\n## 2023 Hybrid AGM\n\nThe 2023 AGM was held in a hybrid format on 5 May 2023. Shareholders had the option of attending the physical AGM at the Principal Meeting Place (with prior registration to ensure the orderly attendance having regard to the size of the venue) or participating through the online AGM.\n\nMost of our Directors (including our Chairman), Senior Management and our independent auditor attended the physical meeting. Our Chairman, The Hon Sir Michael Kadoorie played host and delivered his speech.\n\nThe opportunity for shareholders to attend the AGM and to send their questions in advance of the AGM and in real-time through the online platform allowed shareholders to express their views.\n\n## Highlights of the 2023 Hybrid AGM\n\n- All registered and non-registered shareholders who joined online could view a live webcast of the AGM, pose questions and cast votes in near real-time through the online platform. To ensure the online AGM was conducted effectively, a chat response function was available on the online platform to address procedural questions from shareholders.\n- New call in function was introduced on the online platform allowing shareholders joining online to ask questions verbally.\n- An attendance of around 700 shareholders, 60% of which participated physically and 40% participated online.\n- A high level of votes approving the following major items:\n- the election and re-election of Directors ranging from about 83% to 98%; and\n- the general mandate to issue new shares of up to 5% of shares in issue only, at a price not being at a discount of more than 10% to a benchmarked price (about 98%) and to repurchase shares of not more than 10% shares in issue (over 99%).\n- Through the online platform, shareholders posed various questions and most of these questions were addressed during the meeting; and questions not taken at the AGM were answered in writing and made available on the Company's website.\n\nC\n\nL",

The most recent review was undertaken in October 2023 and the implementation and effectiveness of the Policy was confirmed.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Group Internal Audit\n\nCLP's Group Internal Audit (GIA) department plays a major role in monitoring the internal governance of the CLP Group. The head of the department, Senior Director - GIA, leads a well-resourced department of 23 highly qualified professional staff.\n\nThe Senior Director - GIA reports directly to the Audit & Risk Committee and administratively to the CFO and has direct access to the Board through the Chairperson of the Audit & Risk Committee. The Senior Director - GIA has the right to consult the Audit & Risk Committee without reference to management.\n\n## Independent Auditor\n\nThe Group engages PwC (Certified Public Accountants and Registered Public Interest Entity (PIE) Auditor) as our external independent auditor and we regard their independence as a fundamental governance principle.\n\nHow the Group ensures the independence of the external auditor:\n\n- The lead audit partner for CLP is subject to rotation every seven years (as per The International Federation of Accountants rules on independence of external auditors).\n- As part of the rotation, the current lead audit partner was first appointed for the 2021 financial year-end audit and she did not have any prior involvement in the CLP Group audit.\n- PwC is required to give an annual confirmation on their independence.\n- The Audit & Risk Committee will assess PwC's independence in considering their re-appointment.\n\nIn addition, PwC will not be engaged to perform non-audit work unless the non-audit work meets the criteria suggested in the Listing Rules and has been pre-approved by the Audit & Risk Committee or its delegates. There must be clear efficiencies and value-added benefits to CLP from the work being undertaken by PwC, with no adverse effect on the independence of their audit work, or the perception of such independence.\n\nDuring the year, PwC provided the following audit and permissible audit related and non-audit services to the Group:\n\n|                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | 2023 HK$M   | 2022 HK$M   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|\n| Audit                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | 42          | 42          |\n| Permissible audit related and   non-audit services                                                                                                                                                                                  |             |             |\n| Audit related services                                                                                                                                                                                                              |             |             |\n| (including Sustainability Report  limited assurance, Continuing  Connected Transactions limited  assurance, limited assurance  over regulatory reviews and  reporting, audits of CLP's  provident funds and auditor's  attestation) | 7           | 12          |\n| Non-audit services  (including tax advisory and  other services)                                                                                                                                                                    | 1           | -           |\n| Total                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | 50          | 54          |\n\n(For these purposes, permissible audit related and non-audit services provided by PwC include any entity under common control, ownership or management with PwC or any entity that a reasonable and informed third party having knowledge of all relevant information would reasonably conclude as part of the audit firm nationally or internationally.)\n\nThe fees of PwC and other non-principal external auditors are shown in Note 5 to the Financial Statements.\n\nFor the year ended 31 December 2023, the fees for permissible audit related and non-audit services accounted for 14% and 2% of the total fees respectively.",

The effect can be positive, negative or both, and can result in opportunities and threats. CLP aims to identify risks early so threats can be understood, managed, mitigated, transferred or avoided while opportunities can be captured where appropriate. This demands a proactive approach and an effective Group-wide risk management framework. The risk management framework at CLP comprises four key elements:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## CLP's Risk Management Philosophy\n\nCLP recognises that risk management is the responsibility of everyone within the business, and that cultivating and embedding risk awareness into the organisational culture is critical to implementing the Group's risk management framework. Risk management is therefore integrated into all business and decision-making processes, including strategy formulation, business development, business planning, capital allocation, investment decisions, internal control and day-to-day operations. Risks and opportunities alike are viewed holistically.\n\nCLP has clear risk management objectives:\n\n- At a strategic level , CLP focuses on the identification and management of material risks inherently associated with the pursuit of the Group's strategic and business objectives. In pursuing opportunities for growth and transformation, CLP aims to optimise risk and return decisions as defined and quantified through diligent and independent review and challenge processes.\n- At an operational level , CLP seeks to identify, analyse, evaluate and mitigate operational hazards and threats while enhancing and capturing opportunities for operational improvement where appropriate. It does this to create a safe, healthy, efficient and environmentally friendly workplace for employees and contractors while ensuring public safety and health and minimising environmental impact, as well as securing asset integrity and adequate insurance.",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## CLP's Risk Appetite\n\nCLP's risk appetite represents the nature and extent of the risks the Group is willing to undertake in pursuit of strategic and business objectives. In line with CLP's Value Framework and the expectations of stakeholders, the Group takes only reasonable risks that fit its strategy and capability, can be understood and managed, and do not expose the Group to:\n\n- Hazardous conditions affecting the health and safety of employees, contractors and the general public;\n- Material financial losses impacting the financial viability and strategy execution of the Group;\n- Material breaches of external regulations that could lead to fines or loss of critical operational and business licences;\n- Material damage to the Group's reputation and brand;\n- Business or supply interruptions that could lead to severe impact on the community; and\n- Severe environmental incidents.\n\nCLP has established risk profiling criteria that align with its risk appetite, assessing each identified risk based on a spectrum of consequences and likelihoods. A risk rating is generated by combining these two factors, aiding risk prioritisation and decision-making. In this assessment and prioritisation process, CLP takes into account non-financial consequences as outlined in its risk appetite statement together with financial consequences.\n\n## CLP's Risk Governance Structure\n\n- Facilitates risk identification and escalation while providing assurance to the Board;\n- Assigns clear roles and responsibilities and facilitates implementation with guidelines and tools; and\n- Adopts the Five Lines of Assurance approach as explained below:\n\n<!-- image -->",

This helps provide a holistic view of both risks and opportunities, enabling CLP to make optimal decisions that balance risk and reward.\n\n## Strategic adaptation to evolving external challenges and opportunities\n\n- Understanding the external environment and significant megatrends which may have implications for CLP's business and markets. CLP recognises certain external global trends could have an impact on its operating and strategic environment. These megatrends encompass political, economic, social, environmental and technological changes which could rapidly evolve, changing the context in which the company operates.\n- Climate Vision 2050 is the Group's blueprint and strategy for the transition to net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, and has been instrumental in informing CLP's business strategy and guiding its investment decisions. Climate Vision 2050 is also an integral part of CLP's broader climate strategy, which covers key considerations around scenario analysis and long-term climate risks and opportunities identification, among others. It guides CLP in managing these issues.\n- Material Topics are identified by conducting comprehensive annual materiality assessments to evaluate and respond to the sustainability-related risks and opportunities most likely to impact CLP's business and stakeholders. The material topics emerging from these assessments inform CLP's strategy and reporting on managing sustainability-related risks and leveraging sustainability-related opportunities. This integrated approach embeds material topics into CLP's risk and opportunity management processes.",

The company identifies these risks through its annual materiality assessments and a comprehensive series of top-down and bottom-up risk review processes. Climate scenario analysis and risk analysis are also conducted in line with the Climate Vision 2050 review, conducted once every few years. In line with other material risks, CLP applies a consistent set of risk profiling criteria to evaluate sustainabilityrelated and climate-related risks. Business units and group functions manage these risks in accordance with CLP's risk governance structure and risk management process, with oversight and assurance from management to the Board.\n\nCLP identifies sustainability-related and climate-related opportunities through its annual materiality assessment, the regularly updated Climate Vision 2050, strategy and business planning processes and ongoing monitoring of market developments. Climate scenario analysis provides insights into potential opportunities especially in response to the evolution of the energy system and market. Opportunities are considered in areas such as expanding renewable energy and other low-carbon electricity, offering energy efficiency services, supporting electrification and advancing battery storage. In assessing opportunities, factors such as commercial viability, partnership potential, alignment with climate targets, and future market demand are taken into account. Each business unit monitors and evaluates opportunities specific to their market as part of their business performance reviews. Potential investment opportunities are subjected to a series of opportunity management processes, including business development, business planning, investment decisions and capital allocation.",

This dialogue offers an opportunity for management to identify and respond to emerging risks early on, voice risk concerns, share risk insights and seek risk management guidance.\n- In addition, emerging risks are proactively identified and characterised by observing changes in organisational contexts. They typically emerge as new circumstances or conditions not previously recognised, or as evolutions in the profiles of established risks. Group Risk Management facilitates the review of emerging risks by compiling relevant information from both internal and external sources.\n- Emerging risks that are identified and considered material are further assessed and monitored by relevant business units or Group functions.\n\n## Bottom-up Process\n\n- CLP's business units and Group functions are required to submit their lists of material risks identified through their risk management process to Group Risk Management on a quarterly basis.\n- Through a diligent process of aggregation, filtration, prioritisation and consultation, Group Risk Management compiles a Quarterly Group Risk Management Report for review and discussion by the Group Executive Committee.\n- Upon approval, the report is submitted to the Audit & Risk Committee on a quarterly basis. 'Deep dive' presentations on selected risks are given to the committee for more detailed review.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Independent risk appraisal by Group Risk Management is part of the investment review process.\n- Group Risk Management ensures a detailed risk assessment is carried out for each investment project. Detailed checklists and worksheets are used to identify risks, formulate mitigation measures and assess risk levels. Material risks and associated mitigations are highlighted and discussed at the Investment Committee, chaired by the CEO.\n\n## Risk Management Integrated with Internal Control Systems\n\n- Risk management is closely linked to CLP's Integrated Framework of Internal Control. Key controls are subject to testing in order to assess their effectiveness. Details on Internal Control are set out in the Corporate Governance Report on pages 122 to 125.\n\n## Risk Management in the Business Planning Process\n\n- At CLP, risk management is integrated into strategy and business planning by departments and business units across the Group.\n- As part of the annual business planning process, business units are required to identify all material risks that may impact the delivery of their business strategy and objectives. Overarching strategic risks to the Group are also reviewed. Identified risks are evaluated on the same set of risk criteria as the quarterly risk review process. Plans to mitigate the identified risks are then developed. The material risks listed on pages 135 to 139 have been set out in CLP's 2024 business planning process.",

The top tier risk profile is summarised on pages 135 to 139:\n\n## Material Topics\n\nThe impact of sustainability-related issues on the business and its stakeholders are reviewed regularly through an annual materiality assessment. The review process detailed on pages 42 to 48 helps align the Group's strategy with its purpose and responds to the evolving needs of stakeholders, uncovering emerging ESG challenges and opportunities for consideration in the risk reviews and opportunity management processes.\n\nFollowing the latest assessment, six material topics were identified:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTransition to net zero\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCommunity stewardshipBusiness resilience\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nA safe, future-ready workforceEnergy security and reliability\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nEnergy growth opportunities\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe top-tier risk tables on pages 135 to 139 illustrate the links between material risks and the material topics.\n\n## Climate-related Risks and Opportunities\n\nIn accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) S2 Climate-related Disclosures standard, climate-related risks and opportunities have been classified into three major categories:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nClimate-related transition risks\n\nClimate-related physical risks\n\nClimate-related opportunities\n\nRisks that arise from efforts to transition to a lower-carbon economy that entail policy, legal, technological, market and reputational risks, and could carry financial implications for a business, such as increased operating costs, asset impairment due to new or amended climate-related regulations or shifting consumer demands and the development and deployment of new technology.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRisks resulting from climate change that can be event-driven (acute physical risk) or from longer-term shifts in climatic patterns (chronic physical risk), and could carry financial implications for a business, such as costs resulting from direct damage to assets or the indirect effects of supplychain disruption.\n\nClimate-related opportunities are the potential business opportunities resulting from the effects of climate change. Efforts to mitigate and adapt to climate change can produce climate-related opportunities for a business, such as investment opportunities in renewable energy, broader revenue streams and the adoption of new technologies.\n\nCLP recognises the wide-ranging implications of climate change and considers climate-related risks a combination of standalone risks and drivers for other material risks. As illustrated in CLP's top-tier risk tables on pages 135 to 139, climate-related transition risks and physical risks have been identified respectively as standalone risks, categorised under Regulatory Risk and Operational Risk.

There is also a possible risk of adverse regulatory changes in the medium to longer term.\n\nThe Group's Australian business continues to face regulatory challenges which may restrict its margin recovery, increase the complexity and cost of market operations, and present significant regulatory compliance challenges.\n\nIn Mainland China, the power sector reforms have resulted in a gradual evolution towards a market-based trading, together with other regulatory changes such as tighter environmental rules. CLP devised adaptive market sale strategies to enhance its riskbearing ability.\n\nGeopolitical tensions between China and its major trading partners may bring new challenges to CLP's business. Additional government approval on foreign direct investment (FDI) in India, such as Press Note 3 requirements, may delay or prohibit CLP's development and acquisition of projects in the region.\n\n## CLP manages regulatory risk by:\n\n- a)  Closely monitoring regulatory development as well as market and public sentiments;\n- b)  Working constructively with governments to advocate CLP's position on regulatory changes;\n- c)  Mobilising internal resources to ensure timely responses to regulatory changes, while maintaining regulatory compliance and oversight;\n- d)  Communicating and highlighting the importance of a balance between a reliable and safe supply, care for the environment, and reasonable tariffs;\n- e)  Reinforcing CLP's efforts to care for the community and promote energy efficiency;\n- f)  Developing capacity and decarbonisation scenarios to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 and progressively phase out remaining coal-fired generation assets before 2040;\n- g)  Working with the Hong Kong Government to explore ways to enhance regional cooperation on zero-carbon energy;\n- h)  Conducting supply chain review for assets on imported equipment and spares and exploring alternative sources and localisation opportunities; and\n- i) Proactively engage with regulatory bodies and closely monitor FDI project plans.\n\nAs CLP progresses its strategy to address climate change challenges, the pace of change in government policies, regulations, technologies and market structures could be faster than the Group's responses.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Group Top Tier Risks - Regulatory       | Related Material Topics and  Climate-related Risk &   Opportunity Drivers   | Change in 2023   | Additional References    |\n|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|--------------------------|\n| 12.

Combined assurance includes Board oversight by the Audit & Risk Committee, management oversight by the CEO and the Group Executive Committee, independent assurance by internal audit, control and monitoring by Group functions, and risk and control ownership by business units. It should be acknowledged that CLP's risk management and internal control systems are designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure in achieving our strategic and business objectives and can only provide reasonable - not absolute - assurance against material loss or misstatement.\n\nThe Audit & Risk Committee, on behalf of the Board, has reviewed the effectiveness of the Group's risk management and internal control systems during the period covered by this Annual Report.

The Chairperson reports to the Board at the Board meetings in which the half-year and full-year financial statements are considered and this would cover key issues considered by the Committee in the course of the review of the preparation of the financial statements.\n\n## Terms of Reference\n\nThe Committee's terms of reference follow international best practice and they also comply with the HKICPA's 'A Guide for Effective Audit Committees' and the Corporate Governance Code.

I also wish to thank our retired Committee Member Mrs Fanny Law for her contributions to the Committee. For the many years of service on the Committee, she had always maintained the strict discipline of challenging management constructively and with wise counsel. Looking ahead, the external environment continues to be challenging and more complex, this requires management to remain vigilant in how we monitor, report and manage the risks. The Committee will strive to be effective in our oversight of the Group's risks and also in providing the constructive challenge to management on matters that come under the purview of this Committee.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMay Siew Boi Tan\n\nChairperson, Audit & Risk Committee Hong Kong, 26 February 2024",

The Committee is authorised by the Board to investigate all matters that fall within its terms of reference.\n\nThe objectives of the Committee are to oversee management and advise the Board on matters required to enable the CLP Group:\n\n- a  to operate on a sustainable basis for the benefit of current and future generations;\n- b  to achieve sustainable growth having regard to the Group's impact on its value chain;\n- c to effectively manage the Group's sustainability-related risks and opportunities; and\n- d  to disclose and communicate the Group's sustainability progress and objectives.\n\n## Terms of Reference\n\nThe terms of reference of the Committee were recently updated in January 2024 and are set out on the CLP's and the Hong Kong Stock Exchange's websites.\n\n## Looking Ahead\n\nFirst of all, I wish to express my gratitude to the immediate past Committee Chair, Mr Richard Lancaster for his leadership of this Committee and the solid foundation that has been laid for this Committee under his guidance. I am extremely enthusiastic about my chairmanship at this Committee and equally excited about CLP's work in this space.\n\nThe expectations regarding the Group's climate action commitment have been growing and this will expand to the broader sustainability commitments. A key focus for the Committee for the year ahead will be the publication of CLP's updated Climate Vision 2050 and how we engage with our stakeholders on this and to continue our work on the financial-related disclosures associated with the Group's energy transition. In addition, the Committee will review and consider nature-related assessments and disclosures, considerations related to human rights, as well as sustainability in procurement.\n\nAs the new Chair, I can see CLP and the Committee have made excellent progress in sustainability over the years and it is important that the good work on this should and must continue.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nChunyuan Gu\n\nChairman, Sustainability Committee Hong Kong, 26 February 2024",

Where payments are made to the individual over more than one financial year, this is explained in the notes.\n\nTo provide a clear picture of remuneration, amounts are shown as recurring or non-recurring items. Recurring items are the normal annual remuneration of Executive Directors and Senior Management while non-recurring items relate primarily to the appointment or termination of Executive Directors and Senior Management.\n\nIn the tables on page 164 and pages 171 and 172 the 'Total Remuneration' column for 2023 includes the following recurring items:\n\n- (i) base compensation, allowances & benefits paid;\n- (ii) 2023 annual incentive accrued based on previous year's Company performance and the 2022 annual incentive adjustment. The adjustment is the difference between the actual annual incentive paid in 2023 for 2022 performance and the annual incentive accrual for 2022;\n- (iii)  the 2020 long-term incentive award paid in January 2023 when the vesting conditions were satisfied (the comparative figures are the long-term incentive for 2019 paid in 2022). Approximately 22% of the decrease in the value of the phantom shares portion of 2020 long-term incentive payments resulted from the change in CLP Holdings' share price between 2020 and 2022, with dividends reinvested; and\n- (iv)  provident fund contribution made.\n\n## Performance Outcomes for the Year\n\nIn considering performance outcomes against the balanced scorecard of measures set for the 2023 performance year, the Committee reviewed progress made against a mix of financial, operational, safety, environmental, internal control and objectives reflecting strategic priorities and long-term sustainability.\n\nIn 2023, the Committee considered the strong operating financial performance of the Group significantly above 2022's results, together with material progress made in decarbonisation and strategy execution, improved operating performance and maintenance of a good safety, governance and control environment. Having considered these factors, the Committee decided to award a higher performance outcome than 2022.",

Our Policy is designed to be sustainable, aligned with shareholders and simple . Delivery of a highly reliable supply of electricity today together with transforming our business to become better fit for a net-zero future is a commitment that requires long-term stewardship and a sustainable approach to remuneration. Ensuring fairness and internal equity; encouraging and rewarding appropriate behaviour while discouraging inappropriate behaviour; and balanced judgement of short- and long-term performance, aligned with shareholder outcomes, underpin this approach.\n\nFairness and internal equity are key elements of our approach. Depending on individual roles, Senior Management is responsible for a mix of businesses: a vertically integrated regulated business in Hong Kong, a customer-focused energy business in Australia, and an independent power producer in Mainland China, India, Taiwan Region and Thailand. We seek to fairly recognise the extent of Senior Management's assigned job responsibilities and capabilities demonstrated, and to ensure that our remuneration attracts, retains, and motivates a diverse, high-performing executive team. The structure of our executive remuneration packages is assessed in terms of appropriateness to the role, and with reference to both local and international markets. We emphasise strong management development, succession planning and job mobility to fill vacancies for executive positions as we believe that a long-term career with the Group is an important asset to CLP. Consequently, external competitiveness of remuneration must be balanced with internal equity. While Senior Management pay reflects the scale and scope of their responsibilities, our policy is designed to ensure that remuneration structure and outcomes are aligned with our wider workforce, whose skills, values, and commitment are essential to our success, and HR&RC decisions on executive pay outcomes are taken in the context of wider workforce considerations.\n\nSenior Management pay is structured to seek to avoid excessive risk-taking in the achievement of performance targets and is governed by and compliant with relevant regulatory frameworks. In determining incentive payments and total remuneration, the HR&RC considers and balances a broad range of performance indicators including financial (e.g., long-term growth in the share price and dividends), operational, safety, environmental, social, business sustainability (including responding to climate change), governance and compliance-related factors linked to CLP's strategy. Decisions on pay reflect considerations of both what was achieved and how it was achieved. The determination of performance outcomes is not formulaic, as the HR&RC believes that their overriding responsibility is to exercise judgement and responsibility, ensuring alignment between shareholders and management.",

We have maintained our Remuneration Policy in line with prior years in part on the belief that the current arrangements remain fit for purpose, are embedded into our business and are well-understood both internally and externally. Mindful of continuing external interest and debate on executive pay, we have reshaped the structure of our reporting on Remuneration Policy in order that the links between policy, strategy and performance are more clearly and simply articulated.\n\n## Remuneration Policy\n\n## Executive Directors and Senior Management (excluding Managing Director - EnergyAustralia)\n\nThe illustration below summarises policy design and operation for members of Senior Management.

As a result, the disclosure for Senior Management for 2022 in the table is revised accordingly. To align with broader market practice, CLP also introduced extended disclosure of Group Executive Committee Members and the attendee to enhance the transparency of its broader leadership team. Details of the Members of the Group Executive Committee are set out on pages 90 and 91.\n\nDetails of the remuneration of the Senior Management are set out below (except for the Executive Directors, that are set out in 'Executive Directors - Remuneration in 2023').\n\n|                                                                             | Recurring Remuneration Items                          | Recurring Remuneration Items   | Recurring Remuneration Items   | Recurring Remuneration Items         |                           | Non-recurring  Remuneration  Items   | Non-recurring  Remuneration  Items   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|\n|                                                                             | Performance Bonus  2                                  | Performance Bonus  2           | Performance Bonus  2           | Performance Bonus  2                 |                           |                                      |                                      |\n|                                                                             | Base   Compensation,   Allowances &  Benefits  1 HK$M | Annual   Incentive HK$M        | Long-term   Incentive HK$M     | Provident   Fund   Contribution HK$M | Total   Remuneration HK$M | Other   Payments HK$M                | Total HK$M                           |\n| 2023                                                                        |                                                       |                                |                                |                                      |                           |                                      |                                      |\n| Current:                                                                    |                                                       |                                |                                |                                      |                           |                                      |                                      |\n| Chief Financial Officer   (Mr Nicolas Tissot)                               | 7.0                                                   | 4.7                            | 0.4                            | 1.3                                  | 13.4                      | -

        "page_content": "## Board's Statement on Sustainability\n\nThe following is a statement from the Board of Directors explaining the Board's oversight of sustainability-related issues and how CLP approaches the management of sustainability-related issues.\n\n## Governance structure\n\nThe CLP Board is ultimately responsible for CLP's sustainability-related issues, and governance of sustainability is integrated into our corporate governance structure across the Group. The Sustainability Committee is primarily responsible for managing the sustainability issues within the Group. It places a high priority on climate change developments and our own climate action, with a particular emphasis on the impact of longer-term sustainability issues on the Group's business strategy. The Sustainability Committee, as a Board Committee, is supported by the Sustainability Executive Committee and coordinated through the Group Sustainability Department. The Audit & Risk Committee continues to oversee monitoring of significant sustainability-related risks and the assurance process of ESG data. For further details on the governance structure, please refer to page 98 of the Corporate Governance Report on 'CLP's Approach to Sustainability Reporting'.\n\n## How does CLP approach and manage material sustainabilityrelated issues?\n\nCLP regularly reviews its strategic priorities against sustainability risks and opportunities to ensure they remain appropriate. The first post-pandemic year, 2023 saw a slow but steady recovery from the shocks of COVID-19. However, uncertainty persisted in the shape of an indeterminate economic future, complex international trade relationships, and geopolitical unrest in the Middle East and Ukraine. These incidents show that ESG concerns are dynamic and can have immediate as well as long-term effects. They also highlight the significance of conducting regular assessments of strategic priorities.\n\nIn 2023, CLP made efforts to provide a more detailed description of its sustainability-related impacts, risks and opportunities (IROs) with reference to IFRS S1 - General Requirements for Disclosure of Sustainability-related Financial Information which was published in June 2023. In addition, CLP has improved its strategy for handling IROs by adding a clear time horizon and outlining the position of the IROs in the value chain. This enables CLP to fully respond to the needs of stakeholders, better reflect sustainability risks and opportunities in its business strategy and enable enhanced transparency in reporting. Furthermore, there has been a closer integration between the processes of risk management and materiality assessment. The sustainability priorities which are determined through the comprehensive annual materiality assessment process, have been taken into account in CLP's risk management process. The materiality results were categorised as:\n\n- Financially material priorities, which could reasonably be expected to affect the Group's cash flows, access to finance or cost of capital in the short, medium and\n\nlong term, as per the IFRS S1 standard, are covered in this Annual Report and are for reporting purposes our response to the ESG Reporting Guide. Information is material if omitting, misstating or obscuring it could reasonably be expected to influence investment decisions. The key audience is providers of financial capital.\n\n- Impact material priorities, which reflect significant positive or negative impacts on people, the environment and the economy, are covered in the Sustainability Report. They address the concerns of a diverse range of stakeholders, including customers, people, partners and community, who are interested in CLP's positive and negative contributions to sustainable development.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAs part of Year 3 in CLP's three-year materiality assessment cycle, CLP's Senior Management was interviewed to obtain collated views on the business outlook and challenges in operations. Further, the sustainability IROs were identified and assessed against megatrends analysis, CLP's top tier risk list and broader CLP strategy. The materiality results were presented first to the Sustainability Executive Committee and then to the Sustainability Committee for their review and endorsement. In addition, CLP appointed for the first time a non-financial auditor to perform limited assurance over its materiality assessment process in accordance with the International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000 (Revised), Assurance Engagements Other Than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information. Further details of the materiality assessment process can be found in Delivering Our Sustainability Agenda - Overview on page 42.\n\nThe sustainability IROs have been grouped under six sustainability priorities which are: (i) transition to net zero; (ii) energy growth opportunities; (iii) energy security and reliability; (iv) a safe, future-ready workforce; (v) business resilience; and (vi) community stewardship. For further details on how sustainability priorities are addressed by the Sustainability Committee, please see the Sustainability Committee Report on page 148.\n\n## CLP's Climate Vision 2050\n\nClimate change continues to be one of the top sustainability priorities for CLP. Following the 2021 review of its decarbonisation targets and climate commitments under CLP's Climate Vision 2050, CLP now has strengthened further its targets in view of latest developments in climate science and the policy landscape. The updated targets and the detailed transition plan are detailed in CLP's Climate Vision 2050 (2024 edition). The transition plan will be updated every three years and annual updates on key metrics will be included in the Annual Report. Preparation of CLP's updated Climate Vision 2050 has made reference to IFRS S2 Climate-related Disclosures.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Board recognises that climate change is one of the most material risks to CLP's business and will continue to provide oversight to ensure that the Group acts in a responsible manner and will be able to pursue the opportunities that may arise from the energy transition.",

A ten-year summary is on the CLP website.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Senior Management\n\nThe biographical details of the Senior Management as at the date of this Report are set out on pages 89 to 91. Details of their remuneration are set out in the Human Resources & Remuneration Committee Report on page 157.\n\n## Major Customers and Suppliers\n\nSales to the Group's five largest customers together represented less than 30% of the Group's total turnover during the year. Purchases from the Group's five largest suppliers, in aggregate, accounted for 58.24% of the Group's total purchases during the year and a breakdown of the purchases (as a percentage of the Group's total purchases)\n\nfrom each of the five largest suppliers are set out below in descending order:\n\n- 1  15.07% from Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) in which the Group has no economic interest. AEMO is the administrator and operator of the Australian energy market, from whom electricity is bought to supply EnergyAustralia group customers and to whom electricity is sold from EnergyAustralia group generators (as market participants, EnergyAustralia group entities are members of AEMO but do not hold any economic interest in AEMO).\n- 2  13.00% from PetroChina International South China Co., Ltd. (PCISC) in which the Group has no interest. CAPCO purchases natural gas from PCISC for its electricity generation.\n- 3  12.84% from Guangdong Nuclear Power Joint Venture Company, Limited (GNPJVC) which is 25% owned by the Group. GNPJVC owns Guangdong Daya Bay Nuclear Power Station (GNPS), and CLP Power, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company and the largest electricity supplier in Hong Kong, purchases 80% of GNPS's output for supply of electricity to its customers in Hong Kong.\n- 4  12.14% from CNOOC China Limited (CNOOC) in which the Group has no interest. CAPCO purchases natural gas from CNOOC for its electricity generation.\n- 5  5.19% from Ausgrid Operator Partnership (Ausgrid) in which the Group has no interest. EnergyAustralia pays the distribution charges to Ausgrid which owns and operates the electricity distribution network that provides services to customers located in Sydney, the Central Coast and Hunter regions of New South Wales.\n\nAs at 31 December 2023, none of the Directors, their close associates or substantial shareholders of the Company had any interest in those suppliers other than their indirect interests in GNPJVC, which interests arose from the Group's interest in GNPJVC and the Group's approximate 0.28% shareholding interest in CGN Power Co., Ltd. (the listed entity of which GNPJVC is a subsidiary).\n\n## Directors\n\nAs at the date of this Report, the Directors of the Company together with their biographical details are set out on pages 82 to 89 of this Annual Report.

Chiang and Ms Wang Xiaojun Heather who were appointed in October 2023 and May 2023 respectively, the Directors held their office for the whole year ended 31 December 2023. Details of Directors' remuneration are set out in the Human Resources & Remuneration Committee Report on page 157.\n\nMrs Law Fan Chiu Fun Fanny retired as an Independent Non-executive Director of the Company at the conclusion of the 2023 AGM held on 5 May 2023 to make way for future appointments of new independent directors who would bring fresh ideas to the Board.

Chiang was appointed as the CEO and an Executive Director of the Company with effect from 1 October 2023.\n\nUnder the Company's Articles of Association, Directors are subject to retirement by rotation and re-election at the AGM. In accordance with Article 125 of the Company's Articles of Association, Ms Wang Xiaojun Heather and Mr T.K. Chiang, appointed in May 2023 and October 2023 respectively, will retire at the 2024 AGM. In accordance with Article 119 of the Company's Articles of Association, Mr Richard Lancaster, Ms Christina Gaw, Mr Chunyuan Gu, Mrs Zia Mody and Ms May Siew Boi Tan will retire by rotation at the 2024 AGM.\n\nAfter having served as the CEO of the Company for 10 years, Mr Richard Lancaster was succeeded by Mr T.K.

Therefore, Mr Richard Lancaster will not stand for re-election as a Director at the 2024 AGM.

Mrs Zia Mody has served on the CLP Holdings Board since 2015, as she is currently in her eighth year of service as an Independent Non-executive Director, she decided not to seek re-election.

None of the Directors offering themselves for election or re-election at the 2024 AGM has a service contract with the Company which is not determinable by the Company within one year without payment of compensation.\n\nThe Company made an announcement on 27 February regarding the retirement of Mrs Zia Mody and Mr J.A.H.

In accordance with Article 125 of the Company's Articles of Association, Mr Gonz\u00e1lez Morales will retire, and being\n\neligible, offer himself for election by shareholders at the 2024 AGM.\n\n## Directors' Interests in Transactions, Arrangements or Contracts\n\nDuring the year ended 31 December 2023, none of the Directors or his / her connected entity had directly or indirectly any material interest in transactions, arrangements or contracts of significance entered into by the Group.\n\n## Directors of Subsidiaries\n\nThe names of all directors who have served on the boards of the subsidiaries of the Company during the reported period (full-year 2023 and for 2024 up to the date of this Report) (the Period) are available on the CLP website.\n\n## Permitted Indemnity Provisions\n\nDuring the Period, the Company has in force indemnity provisions as permitted under the relevant statutes for the benefit of the Directors (including former Directors) of the Company or its associated companies. The permitted indemnity provisions are provided for in the Company's Articles of Association and in the Group-wide directors and officers liability insurance maintained by the Company in respect of potential liability and costs associated with legal proceedings that may be brought against the Directors of the Company.\n\n## Continuing Connected Transactions\n\nChina Southern Power Grid International (HK) Co., Limited (CSG HK) (for reference, China Southern Power Grid Co., Ltd. (CSG) and its subsidiaries, collectively, the CSG Group) is a connected person of CLP Holdings (at the subsidiary level) by virtue of CSG HK being a substantial shareholder of CAPCO, a subsidiary of CLP Holdings. Accordingly, ongoing transactions entered into between members of the CSG Group and members of the CLP Group constitute continuing connected transactions (CCTs) for CLP Holdings under Chapter 14A of the Listing Rules.\n\nUnder the Listing Rules, the Group's CCTs relating to the power purchase arrangements with the CSG Group are required to be subject to an annual aggregate cap determined by the Company, and for 2023, this was HK$1,776 million. The annual aggregate cap was approved by the Board of Directors in December 2022 and subsequently disclosed in the announcement dated 3 January 2023 (2023 Announcement). The project level caps of the CCTs for 2023 set out in the table on pages 178 to 193 are for reference only and were used to derive the annual aggregate cap of HK$1,776 million.\n\nOther details of the CCTs, which are required to be disclosed pursuant to Rules 14A.49 and 14A.71 of the Listing Rules, are also set out in the same table. The considerations for 2023, unless otherwise stated, represented the actual transaction values of the relevant CCTs in the full twelve months of 2023.",

To achieve this objective, it is always our aim to present the financial information of CLP as clearly and concisely as possible. This overview helps you understand how information is organised and presented in our financial statements. Hopefully, this will bring you a more insightful reading experience.\n\n## Accounting Mini-series\n\nWe believe that understanding financial statements is a right, not a privilege. To help those unfamiliar with accounting terms read our financial statements, we have developed an Accounting Mini-series to explain topical and difficult accounting concepts in a way that is easier to understand . A number of topics have been discussed since 2007, the content of which can be found in our website.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRead our accounting mini-series\n\n## Material Accounting Policies\n\nFinancial statements are prepared in accordance with Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards (HKFRS).  You do not need to be familiar with all the requirements of HKFRS because the accounting policies which are material and relevant to the Group are disclosed in the financial statements .\n\nThe disclosures include specific principles and procedures selected and applied by management in preparing the financial statements, as well as the methods, measurement basis and procedures to account for the transactions.\n\nLook for gold gradient boxes\n\n## Tips & Hints\n\nTips & Hints are our initiatives to facilitate you to understand the content of a particular disclosure or complicated accounting concepts or terms .\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nLook for archery target\n\n## Essential Financial Statements\n\nFinancial statements start with summaries of the financial position, performance and changes in resources of the Group. These summaries are presented in three essential financial statements with different objectives as shown in the diagram . The relationships between these statements and the interactions with the Group's stakeholders are set out in our website.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgements\n\nManagement makes judgements and estimates in preparing the financial statements, some of which will have a significant effect on the reported results and financial position. HKAS 1 specifies that an entity shall disclose (1) the key judgements that have the most significant effect on amounts recognised; and (2) the assumptions and other sources of estimation uncertainty at period end that have a significant risk of material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets or liabilities within the next financial year. You should pay attention to our disclosures under 'critical accounting estimates and judgements' which help you assess CLP's financial position and performance and understand the sensitivities to changes in assumptions .\n\nLook for gold boxes\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Accounting Mini-series\n\n## Joint Arrangements and the Accounting Implications\n\nIn today's business landscape, it is common for corporations to expand their interests by exploring new business opportunities and avenues. This expansion typically involves establishing new entities or investing in existing ones, aiming to foster business growth and seize emerging opportunities. Besides traditional investment methods such as controlling subsidiaries, influential associates, and passive equity interest investments, corporations often opt for joint arrangements to collectively pursue mutual business goals.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn the following section, we will provide a concise overview of joint arrangements, examine their merits and drawbacks, delve into the accounting classification of different joint arrangements - joint ventures and joint operations, explore their pertinent accounting implications, and use CLP Group's case studies to illustrate these points.\n\n## What is a joint arrangement?\n\nA joint arrangement represents a contractual agreement between two or more parties collaborating on specific economic activities or projects. This arrangement is especially prevalent in industries demanding substantial capital investment, such as the energy and utilities sector, where CLP Group operates.\n\nFrom an accounting perspective, a defining characteristic of a joint arrangement is the exercise of joint control by the involved parties. The joint control is typically established through contractual agreements or other formal arrangements. Joint control implies that decisions significantly affecting the returns of the invested entity necessitate unanimous agreement from all controlling parties involved. These distinctive elements set joint arrangements apart from other collaborative forms involving multiple investors.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Why establish a joint arrangement?\n\nTo achieve specific commercial goals and optimise the risk and return profile of an investment, investors should understand the pros and cons of the form of investment. The following outline several significant advantages and disadvantages related to joint arrangements:\n\n## Advantages\n\n## Risk Sharing\n\nFinancial and operational risks are shared among the joint arrangement partners ('Partners'), thereby lessening individual exposure to financial burdens without full commitment.\n\n## Resource and Expertise Sharing\n\nEnriching the overall capabilities as Partners contribute complementary resources, skills and expertise.\n\n## Cost Efficiency\n\nEnable cost and resource sharing, operational efficiency improvements, and achieving economies of scale, resulting in cost savings.\n\n## Market Entry and Expansion\n\nEasier access to new markets and allow diversification into new industries or sectors by leveraging local Partners' knowledge and relationships.\n\n## Specialisation\n\nHigher-quality outcomes, especially for entities within vertically integrated value chains as Partners can focus on their areas of specialisation.\n\n## Disadvantages\n\n## Shared Control\n\nDecision-making often requires consensus, potentially resulting in disputes or delayed responses to market changes.\n\n## Potential Conflicts of Interest\n\nPartners might possess conflicting objectives or interests, straining the relationship within the joint arrangement.\n\n## Limited Autonomy\n\nThe autonomy of each Partner in their respective areas of expertise may be limited.\n\n## Profit Sharing\n\nThe division of profits may not always align with each Partner's contributions or expectations.\n\n## Exit Challenges\n\nExiting a joint arrangement can be complex, typically necessitating consensus from all or a significant majority of the Partners involved.\n\n## Intellectual Property Concerns\n\nProtecting intellectual property contributed to the joint arrangement can be challenging when shared among Partners.\n\nThe success of a joint arrangement relies on thorough planning, clear terms and conditions, effective communication, and alignment of goals and expectations among Partners. Whether or not to utilise a joint arrangement requires a thorough examination of all relevant factors, including the benefits and costs. This determination should be made on a case-by-case basis.",

        "page_content": "## How does the accounting standard prescribe joint arrangements?\n\nJoint arrangements are prescribed by HKFRS 11, they are classified into two distinct types and with very different accounting treatments.\n\n## Joint venture\n\nOne line share of results on profit or loss and share of net assets on statement of financial position\n\nRing-fencing structure\n\n## Joint operation\n\nLine-by-line share of income, expenses, assets and liabilities as agreed\n\nA joint venture typically involves the formation of a distinct legal entity, with each party holding an ownership interest. The Partner uses the equity method to account for its investment in a joint venture.\n\nIf an investment is qualified as a joint venture, its financial performance and position will not undergo detailed (line-by-line) consolidation in the Partner's financial statements. Instead, its performance is reported under the share of the result of the joint venture while its position is included under interests in the joint venture in the primary statements as if a one-line consolidation. This exemplifies the application of the equity accounting method employed for the joint venture arrangement by sharing net return, and net assets or liabilities.\n\nOne of the key features of a joint venture would be the ring-fencing. The joint venture occurs through the establishment of a distinct legal entity, that exemplifies a ring-fencing structure, delineating asset ownership and liability obligations of the Partners from the joint venture, shielding the Partners from undue financial obligations beyond their investments. It is a protective measure to mitigate risks and ensure transparency and accountability within the joint venture structure. Should the joint venture incur any debts or legal obligations, the Partners typically hold no responsibility beyond their respective investments.\n\nMoreover, joint venture structure helps promote transparency and clarity in operations by establishing distinct management teams and staff dedicated to its functioning. It ensures a clear delineation of responsibilities, decision-making processes, allocation of resources and prevents conflicts of interest, and facilitates effective governance.\n\nOverall, joint venture structure helps protect the interests of Partners, providing a clear framework for operations while safeguarding assets and limiting liabilities.\n\nA joint operation is a contractual arrangement in which the parties involved agree to manage specific activities or projects jointly, sharing the assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses without forming a distinct legal entity. In a joint operation, each party retains control over their designated areas of responsibility, assets and liabilities, sharing returns based on the predetermined framework.\n\nUnder joint operation, each Partner recognises in its financial statements the assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses shared from the joint operation according to the sharing mechanism sets out in the joint arrangement and complies with all relevant accounting standards. This accounting method combines the financial statements of the Partner with its share of the joint operation's details line-by-line.\n\nIn essence, joint operations enable Partners to collaborate towards achieving specific shared objectives in a project manner.\n\n## Identification of a joint arrangement\n\nThe differentiation between a joint venture and a joint operation primarily involves examining specific features as below. Thoroughly assessing these criteria helps differentiate between joint ventures and joint operations, as the classification significantly influences financial disclosures and their associated implications.\n\n## The structure of the joint arrangement\n\nWhether it's established through a separate legal entity , plays a pivotal role in its classification.\n\nIt is an initial indication that the joint arrangement might be a joint venture. If there's no distinct legal entity, it won't qualify as a joint venture and automatically falls into the joint operation classification given joint control exists. However, if there exists a separate legal entity, a thorough assessment is necessary to determine whether it qualifies as a joint venture or joint operation.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## The legal and contractual framework\n\n## Additional facts and circumstances\n\nThe direct allocation of rights (assets) and obligations (liabilities) through the legal framework or contractual terms significantly impacts the classification. In certain circumstances, if the Partners use the contractual arrangement to reverse or modify the rights and obligations inherent by the distinct legal form of the investee, resulting in each Partner having a specific stake in its assets and liabilities, instead of sharing the overall net assets, this could lead to a lack of distinct separation between the Partners and the investee. The modification may result in the arrangement being classified as a joint operation.\n\nDirect allocation of assets and liabilities?\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWhen a separate legal entity exists with a clear segregation of assets and liabilities between the Partners and the investee, other factors come into consideration. These factors include examining the investee's outputs sold, its ability to sell to external parties beyond the Partners involved, pricing agreements between Partners and the investee, and the investee's business model. The purpose of considering these is to determine if, even though the legal structure and contractual agreement suggest that the arrangement is a joint venture, are there any additional facts and circumstances that grant the Partners the majority of the economic benefits associated with the investee or make the investee reliant on the Partners for continuously settling its obligations which might impact the classification.",

        "page_content": "## Other implications\n\nClassifying a joint arrangement as a joint venture necessitates employing equity accounting methods, resulting in a more concise presentation of the joint venture's financial performance and position in the financial statements. Could this compromise transparency or affect the clarity for stakeholders?\n\nIn some instances, establishing a joint venture might be perceived as a strategic move to optimise the financial statements by transferring both assets and more importantly, the liabilities to the joint venture, potentially improving critical financial metrics.\n\nNevertheless, accounting standards ensure sufficient and appropriate disclosure catering to the stakeholders, by mandating summarised financial data for significant joint ventures, an overview of financial data for less significant ones, and their related commitments and contingent liabilities in the accompanying notes. These requirements aim to provide readers with a comprehensive perspective, facilitating their decision-making process.\n\n## Applications in CLP Group\n\nThe table below lists out various joint arrangements entered into by CLP Group:\n\n| Type of  joint arrangement   | Business & Background                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Purpose                                                                                                                                                       | Benefits of the joint arrangement                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Joint Venture                | Hong Kong Offshore LNG Terminal  Hong Kong LNG Terminal Limited is a  collaborative effort between CLP Group  and The Hongkong Electric Co., Ltd ('HK  Electric') which went into operation in  2023.

These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the Group Financial Statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\nKey audit matters identified in our audit are summarised as follows:\n\n- Unbilled retail revenue;\n- The carrying values of EnergyAustralia's energy retail business and generation assets;\n- Fixed asset accounting and the calculation of the Scheme of Control permitted return;\n- Recoverability of trade receivables; and\n- Asset retirement obligations (AROs).\n\n## Key Audit Matter\n\nHow our audit addressed the Key Audit Matter\n\n## Unbilled retail revenue\n\nRefer to note 3 to the Group Financial Statements\n\nRetail electricity and gas revenues are recognised when electricity and gas are supplied to and consumed by the customers. Revenues are measured on the basis of periodic cycle meter readings and include an estimated accrual for the value of electricity and gas consumed from the meter reading date to the end of the reporting period. Unbilled retail revenue of the Group totalled HK$4,001 million as at 31 December 2023.\n\nCLP Power Hong Kong Limited (CLP Power) calculates unbilled revenue using estimates including: consumption quantity based on the electricity sent-out adjusted by loss factors, the pattern of residential and non-residential consumption, weather and certain other factors.\n\nEnergyAustralia Holdings Limited (EnergyAustralia) calculates unbilled retail revenue based on the electricity purchased and the applicable tariffs for the mass market customer segment, as well as the actual meter readings and the contracted rates for commercial and industrial customers. The amount is adjusted for physical energy loss and other measurable factors.\n\nThis is a Key Audit Matter because the calculation of unbilled retail revenue involves a high degree of estimation.\n\nOur procedures in relation to unbilled revenue included:\n\n- Understanding of and testing the key controls in place to determine the estimate of unbilled revenue for both CLP Power and EnergyAustralia;\n- Testing the volume of electricity sent-out by CLP Power to supporting information;\n- Assessing the reasonableness of estimates by comparing them against historical trends;\n- Testing the volume of electricity purchased by EnergyAustralia from the wholesale electricity market to the underlying Australian Energy Market Operator invoices on a sample basis and reconciling the total purchase volumes to revenue volumes; and\n- Understanding the estimates made relating to loss factors and tariffs used in determining the level of unbilled revenue for both CLP Power and EnergyAustralia and assessing their reasonableness by comparing them against historical trends and against the weighted average tariff for prices.\n\nBased on the work performed, we found that the Group's unbilled revenue amount is supported by the available evidence.",

As a result the Group has taken a goodwill impairment charge of HK$5,868 million during the financial year ended 31 December 2023. Post impairment, the management consider that the carrying value of assets in the energy retail business (including remaining goodwill balance) of HK$8,086 million remains supported.\n\nThe cash flow projections used in the value in use calculation are derived from EnergyAustralia's approved business plan which includes cost saving initiatives and an appropriate reflection of future cash flows from potential legislative, regulatory and structural changes in the industry.\n\nThe key assumptions used in the value in use calculation include retail tariffs, electricity and gas volumes, network distribution costs, the customer account growth rate and the discount rate.\n\nThis is a Key Audit Matter, because of the inputs to the value in use model require significant management judgements and a high degree of estimation. Changes in these key assumptions would have a direct impact on the valuation and resulting impairment charge.\n\nOur procedures in relation to management's assessment of the carrying value of EnergyAustralia's energy retail business included:\n\n- Assessing the appropriateness of the valuation methodologies used in the assessment of the recoverable amount;\n- Reconciling input data to supporting evidence, such as the approved business plan and where possible to publicly available market data;\n- Challenging the reasonableness of the key assumptions based on our knowledge of the business and industry;\n- Assessing the discount rate used in the assessment which has included the involvement of in-house valuation experts where appropriate;\n- Verifying the integrity of formulae and mathematical accuracy of management's valuation model;\n- Assessing the potential impact of reasonably possible changes in key assumptions including possible future regulatory policy changes with respect to retail sales of electricity in Australia; and\n- Reviewing the appropriateness of the Group's disclosures with respect to the impairment assessment.\n\nBased on the work performed we found the impairment charge recorded for the year and the 31 December 2023 carrying value of EnergyAustralia's energy retail business is supported by the available evidence and the key assumptions have been appropriately disclosed in note 13 to the Group Financial Statements.",

They are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.\n\nThe carrying value of EnergyAustralia's generation assets are supported by scenarios which are produced to reflect a range of economic conditions that may exist over the life of the assets and the expected power plant closure dates. The key assumptions included within the scenarios include an estimation of forward electricity pool prices (the forward curve), generation volumes, retail volumes, gas prices, long term assumptions around market movements, potential regulatory changes including those impacting the timing of national power plant closure dates and the impact to the useful lives of the EnergyAustralia's generation assets.\n\nManagement has performed an assessment and confirmed that no impairment was required for EnergyAustralia's generation assets at 31 December 2023.\n\nThis is a Key Audit Matter because critical judgements exist in estimating forward electricity pool prices, volumes, gas prices and long term market assumptions.\n\nOur procedures in relation to management's assessment of the carrying value of EnergyAustralia's generation assets included:\n\n- Discussing EnergyAustralia's generation assets scenarios with management and understanding the key assumptions included within them;\n- Assessing the appropriateness of movements in the forward electricity pool prices and the gas prices, and the movements in the market inputs used in the scenarios to available observable market data, where possible;\n- Comparing the historical forecasted generation and retail volumes with the actual volumes;\n- Assessing the useful lives of EnergyAustralia's assets to the committed asset closure of the assets;\n- Reconciling the generation asset scenarios to the approved business plan;\n- Verifying the integrity of formulae and mathematical accuracy of management's valuation model;\n- Assessing the potential impact of possible future regulatory policy changes in Australia; and\n- Reviewing the appropriateness of the Group's disclosures on generation assets.\n\nBased on the work performed, we found that management's scenarios were supported by the available evidence.",

This includes fixed assets and leasehold land relating to CLP Power and Castle Peak Power Company Limited (CAPCO) (together the SoC Companies) (SoC fixed assets) which are the base used in the calculation of the permitted return under the Scheme of Control (SoC) Agreement.\n\nThe annual permitted return is 8% of the SoC Companies' average net fixed assets. If the gross tariff revenue in a period is less than or exceeds the total of the SoC operating costs, the permitted return and the taxation charges, such deficiency shall be deducted from, or such excess shall be added to, the Tariff Stabilisation Fund (TSF). In any period, the amount of deduction from or addition to the TSF is recognised as a revenue adjustment to the extent that the return and charges under the SoC are recognised in profit or loss.\n\nThis is a Key Audit Matter because of the significance of the balance and its importance to the SoC Companies. The accuracy of SoC fixed asset additions, disposals and depreciation charges is important to ensure the SoC fixed asset balance is appropriate and the permitted return is calculated correctly.\n\nOur procedures in relation to the Group's SoC fixed assets and the calculation of the SoC permitted return included:\n\n- Assessing the control environment and testing controls over SoC fixed assets additions, disposals and depreciation charges;\n- Testing the SoC fixed asset additions in the year to supporting evidence on a sample basis and assessing whether the items have been appropriately capitalised;\n- Assessing the appropriateness of SoC capital accruals made by management for large projects by agreeing assumptions to audit evidence from the vendors;\n- Assessing the estimated useful lives of the SoC fixed assets for compliance with the SoC;\n- Testing depreciation charges by performing depreciation reasonableness tests;\n- Obtaining management's reconciliation of SoC fixed assets from the opening balance at the beginning of the year to the closing balance at the end of the year and reconciling this to the general ledger and supporting records;\n- Recalculating the SoC permitted return for the year; and\n- Recalculating the SoC adjustment to revenue for the year.\n\nBased on the work performed, we found that the Group's SoC fixed asset accounting and the SoC permitted return calculation are supported by the available evidence.",

The offtakers for the Group's other generation businesses are mainly a small number of state grid operators in Mainland China. The Group measures the loss allowance for its trade receivables at an amount equal to the lifetime expected credit losses.\n\nExpected credit losses in CLP Power are close to zero as the trade receivables are mostly secured by cash deposits or bank guarantees from customers and have no recent history of default.\n\nEnergyAustralia has trade receivables of HK$6,832 million at 31 December 2023 against which provisions for expected credit losses of HK$770 million are held. Management estimated the level of expected losses, by assessing future cash flows for each group of trade receivables including a probability weighted amount determined by evaluating a range of possible outcomes based on twelve month rolling historical credit loss experience by customer segment, geographical region, tenure and type of customer and applying that weighting to the receivables held at year end. The impact of economic factors, both current and future, is considered in assessing the likelihood of recovery from customers.\n\nAs at 31 December 2023, the Group had total receivables of HK$2,426 million relating to unpaid Renewable National Subsidies in its Mainland China business. The expected credit loss is close to zero as continuous settlements have been noted with no history of default and the subsidy is funded by the Renewable Energy Development Fund set up and administered by the Ministry of Finance.\n\nThis is a Key Audit Matter because of the magnitude of the trade receivables balance and the significant judgement applied in assessing the allowance for expected credit losses.\n\nOur procedures in relation to trade receivables included:\n\n- Testing controls over the billing and collection cycles in CLP Power and EnergyAustralia;\n- Testing the system calculated trade receivables ageing analysis used to assess the recoverability of receivables in CLP Power and EnergyAustralia;\n- Assessing the appropriateness of the credit loss provisioning methodologies used by the Group;\n- Assessing the estimates used to determine the expected credit losses by considering cash collection performance against historical trends and assessing the reasonableness of forward-looking factors included in the expected credit loss model;\n- Reviewing the allocation of deposits to customer balances as a part of CLP Power's expected credit loss assessment;\n- Reviewing the accuracy of management's judgements by comparing historical provisions against actual write-offs;\n- Reviewing minutes of the boards of directors' meetings relating to the recoverability of trade receivables; and\n- Discussion with management to understand the nature and the judgement involved in their determination that the expected credit loss on unpaid Renewable National Subsidies is close to zero, assessing the regulatory eligibility for the Group's projects and considering subsidies collected to-date.\n\nBased on the work performed, we found that management's assessments of the recoverability of trade receivables are supported by the available evidence.",

Estimating the amount and timing of the obligation requires significant judgement. Management has assessed the Group's obligations for each asset based on the local regulatory environment and expected closure dates.\n\nManagement's key ARO judgements are as follows:\n\nThe Group's ARO provision for land remediation and decommissioning of generation assets in Australia was HK$3,544 million. The provisions are based on estimates by external and internal experts that are discounted using internally determined end of plant lives. Other significant judgements also include the timing of the asset removal and costs to remove infrastructure, remediate soil and groundwater, water usage and technological developments.\n\nCLP Power expects that its transmission and distribution network will continue to be used for the distribution of electricity supply to its customers and considers it remote that the network will be removed from the existing land sites. Therefore, AROs have not been recognised for transmission and distribution assets.\n\nCAPCO is retiring the coal-fired generation units at Castle Peak 'A' Station (CPA) between 2022 to 2025. Management considers that the dismantling obligation for the CPA units is covered by the asset decommissioning liability accrued under the SoC as at 31 December 2023.\n\nNo provision for AROs has been recognised for the other generation units of CAPCO as the removal of CAPCO's other fossil-fuel generation units is possible and it is expected that should such obligation be incurred, it will be met by the liability accrued and the cost recovery mechanism under the SoC.\n\nThis is a Key Audit Matter because significant judgement is required in determining whether an ARO exists and estimating the amount and timing of the obligation.\n\nOur procedures in relation to AROs included:\n\n- Assessing the appropriateness of the Group's accounting policy;\n- Evaluating management's judgement that it is remote that the Hong Kong transmission and distribution network would be removed from the existing land sites; it is probable that the CPA units will be removed; and it is possible but not probable that CAPCO's other fossil-fuel generation units may be removed at some point in time in the future;\n- Assessing management's judgements as to whether a contractual or constructive obligation exists based on the respective power purchase agreements, lease agreements, local laws and regulations and past practice;\n- Assessing the independence, objectivity and competence of management's external and internal experts involved in respect of the future cost estimates for those assets where a provision has been recognised; and\n- Testing the appropriateness of management's estimates of future costs, the timing of payments and the discount rates where management has concluded that a legal or constructive obligation exists.\n\nBased on the work performed, we found that the ARO provisions are supported by the available evidence.",

Basis of Preparation\n\nThe Company, CLP Holdings Limited, and its subsidiaries are collectively referred to as the Group in the consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards (HKFRS) issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants (HKICPA) and requirements of the Hong Kong Companies Ordinance (Cap.622).\n\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with HKFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also requires management to exercise their judgement in the process of applying the Group's material accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are especially significant to the consolidated financial statements, are disclosed in relevant notes to the financial statements.\n\n## 2. Changes in Material Accounting Policies\n\n- (A)  Amendments to standards first time adopted in 2023\n\nThere have been a number of amendments to standards effective in 2023. Amendments which are applicable to the Group include:\n\n- Amendments to HKAS 1 and HKFRS Practice Statement 2 Disclosure of Accounting Policies: require entities to disclose their material rather than significant accounting policies, and provide guidance to help entities apply materiality judgements to accounting policies disclosures;\n- Amendments to HKAS 8 Definition of Accounting Estimates: clarify the distinction between changes in accounting estimates, changes in accounting policies and correction of errors;\n- Amendments to HKAS 12 Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising from a Single Transaction: require entities to recognise deferred tax on transactions that, on initial recognition, give rise to equal amount of taxable and deductible temporary differences, such as leases and decommissioning liabilities; and\n- Amendments to HKAS 12 International Tax Reform - Pillar Two Model Rules: provide a mandatory temporary relief from the requirement to recognise and disclose deferred taxes arising from the jurisdictional implementation of the Pillar Two model rules, and provide disclosure requirements for the affected entities to facilitate understanding of the exposure to these rules.\n\nThe Group has applied the above amendments for the first time in 2023. The adoption of these amendments has had no significant impact on the results and financial position of the Group. The Group has not changed its material accounting policies or make retrospective adjustments as a result of adopting these amendments.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nUnder the international tax reform, governments are expected to implement a new global minimum tax framework on multinational enterprises (Pillar Two Model Rules). At the date of this report, the Australian and Hong Kong governments have announced to implement the rules for income years commencing on or after 1 January 2024 and 2025 respectively. The Group continues to monitor the local legislation for Hong Kong and Australia and development of Pillar Two Model Rules in other jurisdictions CLP operates and assess the potential impact.",

Changes in Material Accounting Policies (continued)\n\n## (B)  Amendments to standards and revised interpretation effective after 2023\n\nThe following amendments to standards and revised interpretation, which may be applicable to the Group, have been issued and are effective after 2023. The Group has not elected to early adopt these pronouncements in 2023. These pronouncements are not expected to have a material impact on the results or the financial position of the Group.\n\n- Amendments to HKAS 1 Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current\n- Amendments to HKAS 1 Non-current Liabilities with Covenants\n- Amendments to HKAS 7 and HKFRS 7 Supplier Finance Arrangements\n- Amendments to HKAS 21 Lack of Exchangeability\n- Amendments to HKFRS 10 and HKAS 28 Sale or Contribution of Assets between an Investor and its Associate or Joint Venture\n- Amendments to HKFRS 16 Lease Liability in a Sale and Leaseback\n- HK Interpretation 5 (Revised) Presentation of Financial Statements - Classification by the Borrower of a Term Loan that Contains a Repayment on Demand Clause\n\n## 3. Consolidation and Equity Accounting\n\n## (A)  Basis of consolidation\n\nThe consolidated financial statements of the Group incorporate the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries up to 31 December and include the Group's interests in joint ventures and associates on the basis set out in (B) below.\n\nSubsidiaries are entities over which the Group has control. The Group controls an entity when the Group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power to direct the activities of the entity.\n\nThe financial statements of subsidiaries acquired during the year are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date on which control is transferred to the Group. They are de-consolidated from the date that control ceases.\n\nIntercompany transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between Group entities are eliminated on consolidation. Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred. Where necessary, to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates.\n\n## (B)  Joint ventures and associates\n\nA joint venture is an arrangement in which the Group has joint control, whereby the Group has rights to the net assets of the arrangement, rather than rights to its assets and obligations for its liabilities. Joint control is the contractually agreed sharing of control of an arrangement, which exists only when decisions about the relevant activities require unanimous consent of the parties sharing control.\n\nAn associate is an entity over which the Group has significant influence but not control nor joint control over the financial and operating policies, generally accompanying a shareholding of between 20% and 50% of the voting rights.\n\nInvestments in joint ventures / associates are accounted for using the equity method. They are initially recognised at cost. Subsequent to initial recognition, the consolidated financial statements include the Group's share of postacquisition profit or loss and other comprehensive income, until the date on which joint control or significant influence ceases. Distributions received from an investee reduce the carrying amounts of the investments.",

        "page_content": "## 3. Consolidation and Equity Accounting (continued)\n\n## (C)  Joint operations\n\nA joint operation is an arrangement in which the Group has joint control (as explained in (B) above), whereby the Group has rights to the assets and obligations for the liabilities, relating to the arrangement. When the Group undertakes its activities under a joint operation, the Group as a joint operator recognises its direct right to, and its share of jointly held assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of the joint operation. They are incorporated in the financial statements under appropriate headings.\n\n## (D)  Change in ownership interests\n\nTransactions with non-controlling interests that do not result in a loss of control are treated as transactions with equity owners of the Group. A change in ownership interest results in an adjustment between the carrying amounts of the controlling and non-controlling interests to reflect their relative interests in the subsidiary. Any difference between the amount of the adjustment to non-controlling interests and any consideration paid or received, and the reattribution of other comprehensive income to non-controlling interests are recognised in a separate reserve within equity attributable to owners of the Group.\n\nWhen the Group ceases to consolidate or equity account for an investment because of a loss of control, joint control or significant influence, any retained interest in the entity is remeasured to its fair value, with the change in carrying amount recognised in profit or loss. This fair value becomes the initial carrying amount for the purpose of subsequent accounting for the retained interest as a joint venture, associate or financial asset. In addition, any amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income in respect of that entity are reclassified to profit or loss. Gains or losses on disposals are recognised in profit or loss.\n\nIf the ownership interest in a joint venture or associate is reduced, it is possible that joint control or significant influence is retained or a joint venture becomes an associate. As the Group continues to apply the equity method under both cases, the retained interest is not remeasured. However, a proportionate share of the amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income of the investment is reclassified to profit or loss where appropriate.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nA quick guide to the classification of equity investments:\n\nControl \uf0d2 Subsidiary Joint control \uf0d2 Joint  venture /  joint  operation Significant influence \uf0d2 Associate Less than significant influence \uf0d2\n\nEquity investment\n\n## 4. Inventory\n\nInventory comprises stores and fuel and is stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is calculated on a weighted average basis. Net realisable value is determined on the basis of anticipated sales proceeds less estimated selling expenses.\n\n## 5. Renewable Energy Products\n\nRenewable energy and energy efficiency schemes operate through the creation, trade and surrender of energy products. Renewable energy certificates are recognised upon the risks and rewards being transferred to the Group and are measured at the lower of cost or net realisable value. Cost is calculated on a weighted average basis.",

Retirement Benefits\n\nThe Group operates and / or participates in a number of defined contribution plans and defined benefits plans for its employees, the assets of which are held independently of the Group's assets in trustee-administered funds.\n\nThe Group's contributions to the defined contribution plans are charged to the consolidated statement of profit or loss in the year to which the contributions relate.\n\nThe Group, through its subsidiaries, operates funded defined benefit plans for qualifying employees in Australia. Under the plans, the employees are entitled to lump sum benefits on retirement, death, disablement and withdrawal. The level of benefits provided depends on employees' years of service and final average salary. Plan assets held in trusts are governed by local regulations and practice.\n\nThe cost of providing benefits under the defined benefit plans is determined using the projected unit credit actuarial valuation method. Past service costs are recognised immediately in profit or loss. Remeasurement gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are recognised directly in other comprehensive income.\n\nThe defined benefit asset recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position represents the surplus of the fair value of plan assets over the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the end of the reporting period.\n\n## 7. Foreign Currency Translation\n\nItems included in the financial statements of each of the Group entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates (the functional currency). The consolidated financial statements are presented in Hong Kong dollar, which is the Group's presentation currency.\n\nForeign currency transactions are translated into the relevant functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions or valuation where items are remeasured. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies by using the exchange rates at the end of the reporting period are recognised in profit or loss, except when deferred in other comprehensive income as qualifying cash flow hedges or qualifying net investment hedges.\n\nFor subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates that have a functional currency different from the Group's presentation currency for the purpose of consolidation, assets and liabilities for each statement of financial position presented are translated using the closing rates at the end of the reporting period, and income and expenses for each statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income presented are translated at the average exchange rates for the reporting period (unless this average rate is not a reasonable approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates prevailing on the transaction dates, in which case income and expenses are translated at the date of the transactions). All resulting exchange differences are recognised in other comprehensive income and as a separate component of equity. Reclassifications of gains or losses previously recognised in other comprehensive income to profit or loss are translated by using the exchange rate at the date of reclassification. The remaining reserve balances are translated using the closing rates at the end of the reporting period. Any exchange differences arising from these are taken to retained profits directly.\n\nGoodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated using the closing rates at the end of the reporting period.\n\nUpon disposal of a foreign operation (that is, a disposal of the Group's entire interest in a foreign operation, or a disposal involving loss of control over a subsidiary / loss of joint control over a joint venture / loss of significant influence over an associate that includes a foreign operation), all of the exchange differences accumulated in equity in respect of that operation are reclassified to profit or loss.",

Foreign Currency Translation (continued)\n\nIn the case of a partial disposal that does not result in the Group losing control over a subsidiary that includes a foreign operation, the proportionate share of accumulated exchange differences is re-attributed to non-controlling interests and is not recognised in profit or loss. For all other partial disposals (that is, reductions in the Group's ownership interest in a joint venture or associate that do not result in the Group losing joint control or significant influence) the proportionate share of the accumulated exchange differences is reclassified to profit or loss.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMonetary assets and liabilities are assets to be received and liabilities to be paid in fixed amounts. For example, a trade receivable is a monetary asset (the amount to be received is fixed) but a fixed asset is not a monetary asset because it is uncertain how much you will receive if the fixed asset is sold.\n\nAn entity can have both functional currency and presentation currency, however, a consolidation group can only have presentation currency but not functional currency. This is because presentation currency is a matter of choice but functional currency is based on the different primary economic environment in which each group entity operates.",

Revenue\n\n## Accounting Policy\n\n- (A)  Revenue from contracts with customers\n\nRevenues from sales of electricity and gas are recognised when electricity and gas are supplied to and consumed by the customers. Revenues are measured at the amounts billed to the customers based on the periodic cycle meter readings and the estimated accruals for the value of electricity and gas consumed from the meter reading date to the end of the reporting period ('unbilled revenue').\n\n- (B)  Revenue from sales of properties\n\nRevenue from sales of properties is recognised when the control of asset is transferred to the customer, being at the point in time the physical possession or the legal title of the completed property, and the Group has present right to payment and the collection of the consideration is probable.\n\n## Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgements: Unbilled Retail Revenue\n\nThe Group records revenues from retail energy sales using the accrual accounting method. In Hong Kong, the unbilled retail revenue is calculated using estimates including consumption quantity based on electricity sent-out adjusted by loss factors, pattern of residential and non-residential consumption, weather and certain other factors. In Australia, the unbilled retail revenue is calculated based on the electricity purchased and applicable tariffs for the mass market customers, as well as actual meter readings and contracted rates for commercial & industrial customers. The amount is adjusted for physical energy loss and other measurable factors. Unbilled retail revenue of the Group (included in trade and other receivables) totalled HK$4,001 million at 31 December 2023 (2022: HK$3,470 million).\n\nThe Group's revenue primarily represents sales of electricity and gas, which is recognised over time, and is disaggregated as follows:\n\n|                                                   | 2023 HK$M   | 2022 HK$M   |\n|---------------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|\n| Revenue from contracts with customers             |             |             |\n| Sales of electricity in Hong Kong                 | 50,288      | 50,919      |\n| Transfer for SoC to / (from) revenue (Note 25(A)) | 48          | (604)       |\n| SoC sales of electricity                          | 50,336      | 50,315      |\n| Sales of electricity outside Hong Kong            | 28,828      | 39,186      |\n| Sales of gas in Australia                         | 5,862       | 5,183       |\n| Sales of properties in Hong Kong                  | 645         | 421         |\n| Others                                            | 1,197       | 1,459       |\n|                                                   | 86,868      | 96,564      |\n| Other revenue                                     |             |             |\n| Power purchase agreements                         |             |             |\n| Fixed capacity charge                             | -           | 400         |\n| Variable capacity charge                          | -           | 275         |\n| Energy charge                                     | -           | 3,087       |\n| Others                                            | 301         | 336         |\n|                                                   | 301         | 4,098       |\n|                                                   | 87,169      | 100,662     |",

Fixed Assets\n\n## Accounting Policy\n\nFixed assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the fixed asset. Cost may also include transfer from equity of any gains / losses on qualifying cash flow hedges of foreign currency purchases of fixed assets. Subsequent costs are included in the asset's carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. For any asset replacement, the carrying amount of the replaced part is derecognised. All other repairs and maintenance are recognised as expenses in the period in which they are incurred.\n\nDepreciation of fixed assets is calculated, using the straight-line method, to allocate their costs to their estimated residual values over their estimated useful lives. The estimated useful lives of the fixed assets are set out below:\n\n|                                                                           | SoC fixed assets   | Non-SoC fixed assets   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|------------------------|\n| Freehold land                                                             | not applicable     | not depreciable        |\n| Cable tunnels                                                             | 100 years          | 30 years               |\n| Buildings and civil structures at power stations                          | 35 years           | 20 - 50 years          |\n| Ash lagoon                                                                | 35 years           | 20 - 40 years          |\n| Other buildings and civil structures                                      | 60 years           | 10 - 30 years          |\n| Generating plants                                                         | 25 - 50 years  *   | 20 - 41 years          |\n| Overhead lines (33kV and above)                                           | 60 years           | 20 years               |\n| Overhead lines (below 33kV)                                               | 45 years           | 18 - 20 years          |\n| Cables                                                                    | 60 years           | not applicable         |\n| Switchgear and transformers                                               | 50 years           | 15 - 20 years          |\n| Substation miscellaneous                                                  | 25 years           | 20 years               |\n| Meters                                                                    | 15 years           | 10 years               |\n| Other equipment, furniture and fittings, motor vehicles and marine crafts | 5 - 10 years       | 2 - 10 years           |\n\nThe assets' residual values and useful lives are reviewed and adjusted, if appropriate, at the end of each reporting period. For plant under construction, no depreciation is provided until the construction is completed and the assets are ready for their intended use. An asset's carrying amount is written down immediately to its estimated recoverable amount if the asset's carrying amount is greater than its estimated recoverable amount. The gain or loss on disposal of a fixed asset is the difference between the net sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the relevant asset, and is recognised in profit or loss.",

Fixed Assets (continued)\n\n## Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgements\n\n- (A)  Assessment of the Carrying Value of Generation Assets in Australia\n\nGiven continued changes in the National Electricity Market (NEM) in Australia and changes in the supply and demand equilibrium, risk is introduced in market modelling which heightens the criticality of this judgement area. As part of making these critical judgements, risks do exist in the assumptions made around supply and demand with regard to our generation assets in Australia. In certain circumstances, where demand expectations and supply side responses vary substantially from the assumptions made, particularly in regards to the transition to renewable energy sources and uses, significant changes in the value of the assets could eventuate. The NEM is highly sensitive to a variety of factors such as government intervention and expected power plant closure dates. There has been no change in expected closure dates of our generation assets during 2023.\n\nEnergyAustralia aims to address the enormous challenges associated with climate change and is committed to Australia's transition to net zero emissions with cleaner, reliable and affordable energy for customers. EnergyAustralia is transforming its generation portfolio, investing in cleaner forms of energy, while helping customers to reduce their own emissions. When determining whether the carrying value of the generation assets is supportable, scenarios are produced which reflect a range of economic conditions that may exist over the life of the assets. The scenarios consider a broad range of outcomes including expected power plant closure dates, renewable generation, emissions reduction trajectories, potential regulatory changes including those impacting the timing of national power plant closure dates and the impact to the useful lives of our generation assets in Australia. The scenarios are then considered in terms of likelihood to arrive at management's best estimate.\n\nKey estimates and assumptions for assessing the carrying value of the generation assets are as follows:\n\n- Critical judgement exists in estimating forward electricity pool prices (the forward curve), generation volumes, retail volumes, gas prices and long-term assumptions around market movements and growth rates.\n- Operating costs are escalated by relevant cost drivers using activity-based costing principles. Significant uncertainties exist around fuel supply and non-contracted fuel costs are based on management's estimate of future fuel supply expectation and prices.\n\nThe assessment concluded that the carrying value of generation assets (HK$13.3 billion) was supported by future cash flows. Management particularly considers the generation CGU to be highly sensitive to a change in expected long-term wholesale prices, which interplay with coal supply and expected power plant closure dates. The Group will continually assess the carrying value of the generation assets as the market and the Group transition towards a cleaner energy future.\n\n- (B)  Assessment of the Carrying Values of Fixed Assets and Right-of-use Assets in Other Regions\n\nThe Group has also made substantial investments in fixed assets and right-of-use assets (mainly leasehold land and land use rights) in other regions. The Group conducts impairment reviews of these assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable.\n\nDetermining whether an asset or a CGU should be impaired requires an estimation of the recoverable amount, which requires the Group to estimate the future cash flows, a growth rate (that reflects the economic environments in which the Group operates) and a pre-tax discount rate (that reflects the current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset, inclusive of climate change impact) in order to calculate the present value. Where the present value of the expected cash flows is less than the asset's carrying amount, an impairment loss may arise. During 2023, after reviewing the business environment as well as the Group's strategies and past performance of the investments, management concluded that there was no indicator of impairment of fixed assets and right-of-use assets except for Dali Yang\\_er (Note 5(d)).",

Right-of-Use Assets\n\n## Accounting Policy\n\nThe Group as a lessee recognises right-of-use assets at the commencement date of the lease (i.e. the date the underlying asset is available for use). Right-of-use assets are measured at cost, less any accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, and adjusted for any remeasurement of lease liabilities. The cost of right-of-use assets includes the amount of lease liabilities recognised, initial direct costs incurred, and lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received. Right-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful lives of the assets.\n\nThe Group has lease contracts for land and buildings and various items of plant, machinery and equipment used in its operations.

Investment Property\n\n## Accounting Policy\n\nInvestment property includes property that is being constructed or developed for future use as an investment property. Land held under an operating lease is accounted for as an investment property when the rest of the definition of an investment property under the accounting standard is met. Investment property is measured initially at cost, including related transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, investment property is measured at fair value, unless it is still in the course of construction or development at the end of the reporting period and its fair value cannot be reliably measured at that time. Fair value is based on active market prices, adjusted, if necessary, for any difference in the nature, location or condition of the specific asset. If the information is not available, the Group uses alternative valuation methods such as recent prices on less active markets or discounted cash flow projections. Any gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value or from the retirement or disposal of an investment property are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they arise.",

The income capitalisation approach is based on the capitalisation of the existing rental / licence income and potential reversionary income over the remaining tenure of the property from the date of valuation at appropriate capitalisation rates that by reference to the yields achieved in analysed market sales transactions and as expected by investors. The significant unobservable input is the capitalisation rates adopted for the valuation which are ranging from 4.00% to 4.25% (2022: 3.90% to 4.15%). The fair value is negatively correlated to the capitalisation rate.\n\nThe fair value measurement of the Group's investment property is categorised within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy at 31 December 2023 and 2022.\n\n## 13.  Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets\n\n## Accounting Policy\n\n## (A)  Goodwill\n\nGoodwill arises from the acquisition of subsidiaries and represents the excess of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the acquisition-date fair value of any previous equity interest in the acquiree over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired.\n\nFor the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to each of the CGUs, or groups of CGUs, that is expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. Each CGU or group of CGUs to which the goodwill is allocated represents the lowest level within the entity at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes. Goodwill is monitored at the operating segment level.\n\nGoodwill impairment reviews are undertaken at least annually or if events or changes in circumstances indicate a potential impairment. The carrying value of the CGU containing the goodwill is compared to the recoverable amount, which is the higher of value in use and the fair value less costs of disposal. Any impairment is recognised immediately as an expense and cannot be subsequently reversed.\n\n## (B)  Other intangible assets\n\nIntangible assets other than goodwill are measured initially at cost or, if acquired in a business combination, fair value at the acquisition date. An intangible asset with a finite useful life is amortised on a straight-line basis over its useful life and carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.",

        "page_content": "## 13.  Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets (continued)\n\n## Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgements: Goodwill Impairment\n\nThe recoverable amounts of CGUs with allocated goodwill are determined based on value in use calculations, using cash flow projections derived from the approved business plan which has considered committed cost optimisation initiatives, and a forecast covering a period of ten years, and application of a discounted terminal value. Projections for a period of greater than five years have been used on the basis that a longer projection period represents the long-dated nature of our generation and electricity supply assets and a more appropriate reflection of future cash flows from potential legislative, regulatory and structural changes in the industry.\n\n## Energy retail business in Australia\n\nAs disclosed in Note 4(a), an impairment on energy retail goodwill of HK$5,868 million (A$1,103 million) has been recognised in the profit or loss. Subsequent to this impairment, the recoverable amount of the energy retail CGU is equal to its carrying value at the impairment assessment date of HK$8,086 million (A$1,520 million).\n\n## Key assumptions for value in use calculations\n\nThe key assumptions used in the value in use calculations reflect a combination of internal and external factors impacting gross margin, number of customer accounts and discount rates.\n\nThe assumptions impacting gross margin include:\n\n- Retail tariffs are sensitive to regulatory changes including regulation and deregulation, and based on management estimates and expectations of current and expected market conditions arising from known and potential regulatory outcomes.\n- Electricity and gas volumes for purchases and sales in the short term represent the internal forecast projections. External information is used to verify and align internal estimates.\n- Electricity and gas network (transmission and distribution) cost assumptions are based on published regulated prices. When no estimates are available, network costs are assumed to escalate by the relevant consumer price index.\n- Electricity pool prices, generation volumes, dispatch levels and gas prices were derived using modelling of the electricity and gas wholesale markets. NEM modelling is prepared internally using, where possible, observable inputs. The modelling used for the electricity and gas markets is based on experience and observable market activity.\n\nOther assumptions include:\n\n- The cash flow projections are discounted using a pre-tax discount rate of 11.3% (2022: 11.0%). The discount rates reflect the current market assessments of the time value of money and are based on the estimated cost of capital.\n- A long-term growth rate of 2.5% (2022: 2.5%) is applied in the terminal value calculation beyond a period of ten years of cash flows.",

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets (continued)\n\n## Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgements: Goodwill Impairment (continued)\n\nEnergy retail business in Australia (continued)\n\n## Sensitivity analysis for the energy retail CGU valuation\n\nBoth retail tariffs and customer account growth assumptions are judgemental and have a direct impact on the CGU valuation. Movements in discount rates, whilst driven by different assumptions, would also have an impact.\n\n- A 5% decrease in long-term gross margin would decrease the recoverable amount by HK$1,383 million (A$260 million).\n- A 1% decrease in long-term annual customer growth rate would decrease the recoverable amount by HK$1,373 million (A$258 million).\n- An increase in the discount rate of 0.1% would decrease the recoverable amount by HK$154 million (A$29 million).\n\nThese sensitivities are based on changing the relevant assumption while holding other assumptions constant. In practice, this is unlikely to occur and changes in some of the assumptions may be correlated.\n\n## Hong Kong electricity business\n\nThe key assumptions used in the value in use calculations are as follows:\n\n- Goodwill arising from the acquisition of CAPCO has been allocated to CLP Power and CAPCO as a combined CGU as the acquisition is considered beneficial to the whole SoC business.\n- The electricity tariff for the supply of electricity in meeting the demand of customers in Hong Kong over the forecast periods is determined with reference to the rate-setting mechanism under the SoC.\n- The forecast for electricity demand is based on the load forecast to support local infrastructure development and meeting customer load requirements, maintaining safety and supply reliability, and meeting environmental requirements.\n- Expenditures for the supply of electricity in meeting the forecast demand are based on committed purchase contracts where applicable, and inputs on cost trend specific to the electricity business in Hong Kong. Such forecast aligns with the projection in the Business Plan for our Hong Kong electricity business, with capital expenditures up to 2028 aligned with those forecasted in the approved Development Plan.\n- Terminal value of the CGU is adopted to estimate the cash flows to be generated for the periods beyond ten years. This is expressed as a multiple of net asset values which corresponds to our return model based on fixed assets investment. The terminal value is a multiple of 1.2 times of the net asset values forecasted at the end of 2033.\n- The cash flow projections are discounted using a pre-tax discount rate of 9.75% (2022: 9.69%), or a post-tax return of 8.00% (2022: 8.00%) which reflects the SoC return rate applicable to the electricity business in Hong Kong.\n\nUp to the date of this report, there were no reasonably possible changes in any of the key assumptions mentioned above that would have caused the recoverable amount of this CGU to be less than its carrying value.",

Derivative Financial Instruments\n\n## Accounting Policy\n\nA derivative is initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and is subsequently remeasured at fair value. The method of recognising the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument, and if so, the nature of the item being hedged. Fair value gain or loss arising from derivatives not designated or not qualified for hedge accounting are recognised immediately in profit or loss.\n\nThe Group designates certain derivatives as either fair value hedges, which are hedges of the fair value of recognised financial assets or financial liabilities or firm commitments (e.g. fixed interest rate loans and foreign currency trade receivables) or cash flow hedges, which are hedges of the cash flows of recognised financial assets or financial liabilities or highly probable forecast transactions (e.g. floating interest rate loans and future purchases of fuels denominated in US dollar).\n\nThe Group documents at the inception of the transaction the intended relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk management objectives and strategy for undertaking hedge transactions. The Group also documents its assessment, both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the hedging relationship meets the hedge effectiveness requirements.\n\n## (A)  Fair value hedges\n\nChanges in the fair values of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recognised in profit or loss, which offset any changes in the fair values recognised in profit or loss of the corresponding hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk and achieve the overall hedging result.\n\n## (B)  Cash flow hedges\n\nThe effective portion of changes in the fair values of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges is recognised in other comprehensive income. The ineffective portion is recognised immediately in profit or loss.\n\nAmounts accumulated in equity are reclassified to profit or loss in the periods when the hedged items affect profit or loss. Such reclassification from equity will offset the effect on profit or loss of the corresponding hedged item to achieve the overall hedging result. However, when the highly probable forecast transaction that is hedged results in the recognition of a non-financial asset (for example, inventory or fixed assets), the gains and losses previously deferred in equity are transferred from equity and included in the initial measurement of the cost of the asset at the time of acquisition. The deferred amounts are ultimately recognised in fuel costs in the case of inventory or in depreciation in the case of fixed assets.\n\nWhen a hedging instrument expires, or is sold or terminated, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively. Any cumulative gain or loss remains in equity at that time is accounted for according to the nature of the underlying transactions (as discussed above) once the hedged cash flow occurs. When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that has been recorded in equity is reclassified to profit or loss immediately.",

Derivative Financial Instruments (continued)\n\n## Accounting Policy (continued)\n\n## (C)  Costs of hedging\n\nForward element of forward contracts and foreign currency basis spread of financial instruments may be separated and excluded from the designated hedging instruments. In such case, the Group treats the excluded elements as costs of hedging. The fair value changes of these elements are recognised in a separate component of equity. For time-period related hedged items, these elements at the date of designation (to the extent that it relates to the hedged item) are amortised on a systematic and rational basis to profit or loss over the hedging period. For transaction related hedged items, the cumulative change of these elements is included in the initial carrying amount of any non-financial asset recognised when the hedged transaction occurs or is recognised in profit or loss if the hedged transaction affects profit or loss.\n\n## (D)  Rebalancing of hedge relationships\n\nIf the hedge ratio for risk management purposes is no longer optimal but the risk management objective remains unchanged and the hedge continues to qualify for hedge accounting, the hedge relationship will be rebalanced by adjusting either the volume of the hedging instrument or the volume of the hedged item so that the hedge ratio aligns with the ratio used for risk management purposes. Any hedge ineffectiveness is calculated and accounted for in profit or loss at the time of the hedge relationship rebalancing.\n\n|                                    | 2023        | 2023             | 2022        | 2022             |\n|------------------------------------|-------------|------------------|-------------|------------------|\n|                                    | Assets HK$M | Liabilities HK$M | Assets HK$M | Liabilities HK$M |\n| Cash flow hedges                   |             |                  |             |                  |\n| Forward foreign exchange contracts | 21          | 107              | 3           | 207              |\n| Cross currency interest rate swaps | -           | 1,669            | 33          | 1,011            |\n| Interest rate swaps                | 30          | 8                | 59          | -                |\n| Energy contracts                   | 1,844       | 250              | 3,152       | 599              |\n| Fair value hedges                  |             |                  |             |                  |\n| Cross currency interest rate swaps | -           | 374              | 6           | 377              |\n| Interest rate swaps                | -           | 48               | -           | 80               |\n| Not qualified for hedge accounting |             |                  |             |                  |\n| Forward foreign exchange contracts | 17          | 78               | 20          | 83               |\n| Energy contracts                   | 338         | 843              | 777         | 4,358            |\n|                                    | 2,250       | 3,377            | 4,050       | 6,715            |\n| Current                            | 1,077       | 1,658            | 2,107       | 5,310            |\n| Non-current                        | 1,173       | 1,719            | 1,943       | 1,405            |\n|                                    | 2,250       | 3,377            | 4,050       | 6,715            |\n\nAt 31 December 2023, the contractual maturity profile of the hedging instruments from the end of the reporting period is summarised below:\n\n| Forward foreign exchange contracts   | Up to 3 years   |\n|--------------------------------------|-----------------|\n| Cross currency interest rate swaps   | Up to 13 years  |\n| Interest rate swaps                  | Up to 9 years   |\n| Energy contracts                     | Up to 7 years   |",

Other Non-current Assets\n\n## Accounting Policy\n\n## (A)  Investments\n\nInvestments classified at fair value through other comprehensive income are initially recognised at fair value and are elected to present subsequent changes in fair value in other comprehensive income. The gains or losses on such investments are never reclassified to profit or loss and no impairment is recognised in profit or loss. Cumulative gains and losses recognised in other comprehensive income are transferred to retained profits on disposal of the investment. Dividends on the investments are recognised in profit or loss unless they clearly represent a recovery of part of the cost of the investment, in which case they are deducted from the carrying amounts of the investments directly.\n\nInvestments classified at fair value through profit or loss (mainly investments in funds) are initially recognised at fair value and subsequent changes in fair value are recognised in profit or loss.\n\n## (B)  Contract acquisition costs\n\nIncremental costs to obtain a contract with a customer are capitalised if they are expected to be recoverable.

        "page_content": "## 18.  Properties for Sale\n\n## Accounting Policy\n\nProperties for sale comprise leasehold land and building and are carried at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Properties for sale are included in current assets when it is expected to be realised or is intended for sales in the normal operating cycle.\n\nOn 18 December 2017, the Group and Sino Land Company Limited (Sino Land) agreed to collaborate on redeveloping the Group's former headquarters at Argyle Street for residential purposes and to preserve the Clock Tower building for community use. Under the development arrangement, Sino Land is fully responsible for all development costs such as land premium, construction costs, professional fees etc. and paid a non-refundable upfront payment of HK$3 billion to the Group. The residential property development was completed in November 2022 and the sale of residential units is undergoing.\n\nThe arrangement entered into by the Group and Sino Land does not involve an establishment of a separate legal entity and is considered as a joint operation under HKFRS 11 Joint Arrangements. The non-refundable upfront payment forms part of the proceeds from the property development and is recorded as deferred revenue (Note 22(e)). When legal titles of the units in the developed property are passed to the purchasers, deferred revenue and the percentage share of the sale proceeds to which the Group is entitled will be credited to the profit or loss as revenue, while cost of properties will be charged to the profit or loss as cost of sales.\n\nIn 2023, cost of properties of HK$510 million (2022: HK$325 million) and deferred revenue of HK$507 million (2022: HK$320 million) were recognised to profit or loss.\n\n## 19.  Trade and Other Receivables\n\n## Accounting Policy\n\nTrade and other receivables are recognised initially at transaction price and are subsequently stated at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less allowances for expected credit losses. The Group measures the loss allowance for its trade receivables at an amount equal to the lifetime expected credit losses. The amount of expected credit losses (or reversal) that is required to adjust the loss allowance at the reporting date to its recognised amount is recognised in profit or loss, as an impairment loss or a reversal of an impairment loss. Trade and other receivables are written off (either partially or in full) when there is no reasonable expectation of recovery.\n\nExpected credit losses are a probability-weighted estimate of credit losses (i.e. the present value of all cash shortfalls) over the expected life of the trade receivables. Expected credit losses on trade receivables are calculated by using the provision matrix approach. Trade receivables are categorised by common risk characteristics that are representative of the customers' abilities to pay all amounts due in accordance with the contractual terms. The provision matrix is determined based on historical observed default rates over the expected life of the trade receivables and is adjusted for forward-looking estimates. At every reporting date the historical observed default rates are updated and changes in the forward-looking estimates are analysed.\n\nIf there is no significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, impairment on other receivables is measured at 12-month expected credit losses. If a significant increase in credit risk has occurred, then impairment is measured as lifetime expected credit losses.",

Trade and Other Receivables (continued)\n\n## Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgements: Recoverability of Trade Receivables\n\nProvision for expected credit losses is made when the Group does not expect to collect all amounts due. The provision is determined by grouping together trade debtors with similar risk characteristics and collectively or individually assessing them for likelihood of recovery. The provision reflects lifetime expected credit losses i.e. possible default events over the expected life of the trade receivables, weighted by the probability of that default occurring. Judgement has been applied in determining the level of provision for expected credit losses, taking into account the credit risk characteristics of customers and the likelihood of recovery assessed on a combination of collective and individual basis as relevant. While the provision is considered appropriate, changes in estimation basis or in economic conditions could lead to a change in the level of provision recorded and consequently on the charge or credit to profit or loss.\n\n|                                                  | 2023 HK$M   | 2022 HK$M   |\n|--------------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|\n| Trade receivables  (a)                           | 11,852      | 10,504      |\n| Deposits, prepayments and other receivables  (b) | 1,700       | 6,499       |\n| Loans to a joint venture (Note 14(b))            | 60          | -           |\n| Dividend receivables from                        |             |             |\n| Joint ventures                                   | 31          | 76          |\n| An associate                                     | -           | 228         |\n| Current accounts with  (c)                       |             |             |\n| Joint ventures                                   | 6           | 6           |\n| An associate                                     | 1           | 1           |\n|                                                  | 13,650      | 17,314      |\n\n## Notes:\n\n## (a) Trade receivables\n\nThe ageing analysis of the trade receivables at 31 December based on invoice date is as follows:\n\n|                     | 2023 HK$M   | 2022 HK$M   |\n|---------------------|-------------|-------------|\n| 30 days or below  * | 10,159      | 9,257       |\n| 31 - 90 days        | 735         | 585         |\n| Over 90 days        | 958         | 662         |\n|                     | 11,852      | 10,504      |\n\n*\n\nIncluding unbilled revenue\n\n## Movements in provision for impairment\n\n|                                                          | 2023 HK$M   | 2022 HK$M   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|\n| Balance at 1 January                                     | 852         | 1,456       |\n| Provision for impairment                                 | 249         | 260         |\n| Receivables written off during the year as uncollectible | (266)       | (331)       |\n| Amounts reversed                                         | (3)         | (5)         |\n| Sale of subsidiaries                                     | -           | (419)       |\n| Exchange differences                                     | 4           | (109)       |\n| Balance at 31 December                                   | 836         | 852         |",

Trade and Other Receivables (continued)\n\nNotes (continued):\n\n## (a) Trade receivables (continued)\n\n## Credit risk management\n\nThe Group has no significant concentrations of credit risk with respect to the trade receivables in Hong Kong and Australia as their customer bases are widely dispersed in different sectors and industries. The Group has established credit policies for customers in each of its retail businesses.\n\nIn Hong Kong, electricity bills are due within two weeks after issuance. To limit the credit risk exposure, the Group has a policy to require cash deposits or bank guarantees from customers for an amount determined from time to time by reference to the usage of the customers, and in the normal course of events will not exceed the highest expected charge for 60 days. For all the deposits held, customers are paid at a floating market interest rate equivalent to the HSBC bank saving rate. At 31 December 2023, such cash deposits amounted to HK$6,880 million (2022: HK$6,551 million) and the bank guarantees stood at HK$919 million (2022: HK$867 million). The customers' deposits are treated on the statement of financial position as current liabilities on the basis that they are repayable on demand.\n\nIn Australia, customers are allowed to settle their electricity bills in no more than 45 days after issuance, while certain large commercial & industrial customers can range up to 60 days. EnergyAustralia has policies in place to ensure that sales of products and services are made to retail customers (including residential and commercial & industrial customers) of an appropriate credit quality. For residential customers however, where EnergyAustralia is the designated Financially Responsible Market Participant for electricity customers or Financially Responsible Organisation for gas customers, it is obliged to accept the customer, irrespective of their credit worthiness. In these instances, information obtained in relation to the customer's credit worthiness is utilised for the purposes of risk segmentation and prioritisation of collection strategies to mitigate risk. Collectability is reviewed on an ongoing basis.\n\nTrade receivables arising from sales of electricity to the offtakers in Mainland China, which are mainly state-owned enterprises, are due for settlement within 30 to 90 days after bills issuance. Management has closely monitored the credit qualities and the collectability of these trade receivables.\n\n## Expected credit losses\n\nFor trade receivables relating to accounts which are long overdue with significant amounts or known insolvencies or non-response to collection activities, they are assessed individually for impairment allowance. CLP Power and EnergyAustralia determine the provision for expected credit losses by grouping together trade receivables with similar credit risk characteristics and collectively assessing them for likelihood of recovery, taking into account prevailing economic conditions and forward looking assumptions.\n\n## CLP Power\n\nCLP Power classifies its trade receivables by nature of customer accounts. These include active accounts and terminated accounts.\n\n|                               | Lifetime  Expected  Credit Loss Rate   | Gross  Carrying  Amount HK$M   | Lifetime  Expected  Credit Loss HK$M   | Net  Carrying  Amount HK$M   |\n|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------|------------------------------|\n| At 31 December 2023           |                                        |                                |                                        |                              |\n| Active accounts               |                                        |                                |                                        |                              |\n| Provision on individual basis | 100%                                   | 4                              | (3)                                    | 1                            |\n| Provision on collective basis | 0% *                                   | 2,716                          | (17)                                   | 2,699                        |\n| Terminated accounts           |                                        |                                |                                        |                              |\n| Provision on individual basis | 100%                                   | 9                              | (9)                                    | -                            |\n| Provision on collective basis | 27%                                    | 7                              | (2)                                    | 5                            |\n|                               |                                        | 2,736                          | (31)                                   | 2,705                        |\n| At 31 December 2022           |                                        |                                |                                        |                              |\n| Active accounts               |                                        |                                |                                        |                              |\n| Provision on individual basis | 100%                                   | 8                              | (6)                                    | 2                            |\n| Provision on collective basis | 0%  *                                  | 2,662                          | (12)                                   | 2,650                        |\n| Terminated accounts           |                                        |                                |                                        |                              |\n| Provision on individual basis | 100%                                   | 5                              | (5)                                    | -                            |\n| Provision on collective basis | 24%                                    | 4                              | (1)                                    | 3                            |\n|                               |                                        | 2,679                          | (24)                                   | 2,655                        |",

The application, approval and settlement of the Renewable National Subsidy are governed by the relevant policies issued by the Central People's Government. All of the relevant wind and solar projects are qualified for renewable energy subsidy in accordance with the prevailing government policies. Under normal operating cycle, it takes a relatively long time for settlement as the collection is subject to the allocation of funds by relevant government authorities to local grid companies and there is no due date for the settlement of Renewable National Subsidies. The expected credit loss is close to zero as continuous settlements have been noted with no history of default and the subsidy is funded by the Renewable Energy Development Fund set up and administered by the Ministry of Finance.",

Fuel Clause Account\n\nThe cost of fuel consumed by CLP Power is passed on to the customers. Any variations between the actual cost of fuel and the fuel cost billed to customers are captured in the fuel clause account. The balance on the account (inclusive of interest) represents amounts over-recovered or under-recovered and is treated as an amount due to or from customers. CLP Power may adjust fuel related tariff from time to time, including on a monthly basis, in accordance with the SoC, to reflect changes in the cost of fuels consumed by the SoC Companies for the generation of electricity. At 31 December 2023, the fuel clause account asset balance represented the right of CLP Power to collect the under-recovered fuel costs from the customers under the SoC.",

Trade Payables and Other Liabilities\n\n## Accounting Policy\n\n## (A)  Trade and other payables\n\nTrade and other payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.\n\n## (B)  Lease liabilities\n\nAt the commencement date of the lease, the Group recognises lease liabilities measured at the present value of lease payments with reference to an expected lease term, which includes optional lease periods when the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise the option to extend or not to terminate the lease. The lease payments include fixed payments (including in substance fixed payments) less any lease incentives receivable; variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate; and amounts expected to be paid under residual value guarantees. Variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or a rate are recognised as expenses (unless they are incurred to produce inventories) in the period in which the event or condition that triggers the payment occurs.\n\nLease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease, if this cannot be readily determined, an incremental borrowing rate that the lessee would have to pay to borrow the funds necessary to obtain an asset of a similar value to the right-of-use asset in a similar economic environment, over a similar term and with a similar security. Lease liabilities are subsequently measured by increasing the carrying amounts to reflect interest on the lease liabilities (using the effective interest method) and by reducing the carrying amounts to reflect the lease payments made. Lease liabilities are remeasured (with a corresponding adjustment made to the related right-of-use asset) when there is a change in future lease payments in case of renegotiation, changes of an index or rate or in case of reassessment of options under certain conditions.\n\n|                                              | 2023 HK$M   | 2022 HK$M   |\n|----------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|\n| Trade payables  (a)                          | 6,526       | 6,511       |\n| Other payables and accruals                  | 10,578      | 8,868       |\n| Lease liabilities  (b)                       | 200         | 229         |\n| Advances from non-controlling interests  (c) | 589         | 860         |\n| Current accounts with  (d)                   |             |             |\n| Joint ventures                               | 3           | 2           |\n| An associate                                 | 120         | 359         |\n| Deferred revenue  (e)                        | 2,290       | 2,798       |\n|                                              | 20,306      | 19,627      |\n\n## Notes:\n\n- (a) The ageing analysis of trade payables at 31 December based on invoice date is as follows:\n\n|                  | 2023 HK$M   | 2022 HK$M   |\n|------------------|-------------|-------------|\n| 30 days or below | 6,308       | 6,345       |\n| 31 - 90 days     | 191         | 144         |\n| Over 90 days     | 27          | 22          |\n|                  | 6,526       | 6,511       |\n\nAt 31 December 2023, trade payables denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of the corresponding Group entities amounted to HK$1,311 million (2022: HK$1,280 million), of which HK$1,146 million (2022: HK$1,130 million) were denominated in US dollar (2022: US dollar).",

Bank Loans and Other Borrowings\n\n## Accounting Policy\n\nBorrowings are recognised initially at fair value of proceeds received, net of transaction costs incurred. Transaction costs are incremental costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of a financial liability. Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised cost and, if included as a hedged item in a fair value hedge relationship, are revalued to reflect the fair value movements on the associated hedged risk. Any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption value is amortised to profit or loss or capitalised as cost of the qualifying assets over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method. Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the end of the reporting period.\n\nThe Group's bank loans and other borrowings at 31 December were repayable as follows:\n\n|                           | Bank Loans   | Bank Loans   | Other Borrowings  *   | Other Borrowings  *   | Total     | Total     |\n|---------------------------|--------------|--------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------|-----------|\n|                           | 2023 HK$M    | 2022 HK$M    | 2023 HK$M             | 2022 HK$M             | 2023 HK$M | 2022 HK$M |\n| Within one year           | 11,741       | 8,275        | 831                   | 3,039                 | 12,572    | 11,314    |\n| Between one and two years | 3,351        | 5,728        | 3,165                 | 880                   | 6,516     | 6,608     |\n| Between two to five years | 6,260        | 5,866        | 8,987                 | 11,742                | 15,247    | 17,608    |\n| Over five years           | 3,315        | 3,870        | 19,865                | 19,817                | 23,180    | 23,687    |\n|                           | 24,667       | 23,739       | 32,848                | 35,478                | 57,515    | 59,217    |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAnother presentation of the Group's liquidity risk is set out on pages 273 to 275.",

Deferred Tax\n\n## Accounting Policy\n\nDeferred tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements. However, deferred tax is not accounted for if it arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss and does not give rise to equal taxable and deductible temporary differences. Deferred tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period and are expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset is realised or the deferred tax liability is settled. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised. Deferred tax is also provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates, except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the Group and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are netted off when the taxes relate to the same tax authority and where offsetting is legally enforceable. The following amounts, determined after appropriate offsetting, are shown separately on the consolidated statement of financial position:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|                                                                                                                     | 2023 HK$M                                                                                                           | 2022 HK$M                                                                                                           |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Deferred tax assets                                                                                                 | 2,041                                                                                                               | 2,132                                                                                                               |\n| Deferred tax liabilities                                                                                            | (16,752)                                                                                                            | (16,246)                                                                                                            |\n|                                                                                                                     | (14,711)                                                                                                            | (14,114)                                                                                                            |\n| Deferred tax asset = income tax recoverable in the future Deferred tax liability = income tax payable in the future | Deferred tax asset = income tax recoverable in the future Deferred tax liability = income tax payable in the future | Deferred tax asset = income tax recoverable in the future Deferred tax liability = income tax payable in the future |",

Using the total amount of refunds received, CLP Power provided customers with the Rent and Rates Special Rebate. At 31 December 2023, all the rent and rates refunds received have been provided to customers through the Rent and Rates Special Rebate.\n\nThe refunds are classified within the SoC reserve accounts. The Rent and Rates Special Rebate paid to customers was offset against the refunds received.\n\n## 26.  Asset Decommissioning Liabilities and Retirement Obligations\n\n## Accounting Policy\n\nWhen the Group has a legal and / or constructive obligation for remediation and the likelihood of economic outflow is probable, provisions for asset retirement obligations are recorded for estimated remediation costs of reclamation, plant closure, dismantling and waste disposal. A provision for asset retirement costs is determined by estimating the expected costs associated to remediate the site based on the current legal requirements and technologies and is discounted to its present value with an unwind adjustment recognised in finance costs. An asset is recognised on initial recognition of the provision and is depreciated over the useful life of the facility. The asset retirement costs are reviewed annually and adjustments are made to the carrying amount of the assets to reflect changes made to these estimated discount rates or future costs.\n\n## Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgements\n\nEstimating the amount and timing of the obligation to be recorded requires significant judgement. Management has assessed the Group's obligations for each asset based on the local regulatory environment and expected closure dates.\n\nCLP Power has been investing in the transmission and distribution network to supply electricity to the customers in its supply area in Hong Kong. As CLP Power expects that the land sites being used for the transmission and distribution network will continue to be used for the distribution of electricity supply to its customers, it is currently considered remote that the network would be removed from the existing land sites. Therefore in accordance with applicable accounting standards, asset retirement obligations for these assets have not been recognised by CLP Power.",

Asset Decommissioning Liabilities and Retirement Obligations (continued)\n\n## Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgements (continued)\n\nAs agreed with the Hong Kong Government, CAPCO is retiring the coal-fired generation units at Castle Peak 'A' Station (CPA) when they reach the end of their useful lives between 2022 to 2025. Following this retirement, the removal of CPA's coal-fired generation units has become probable. In support of the Government's net-zero carbon emissions targets in the 'Hong Kong's Climate Action Plan 2050', CAPCO is working on the phasing-out of the use of coal for daily electricity generation in Castle Peak 'B' Station and exploring the ways to convert its gas-fired generation facilities to operate on green fuels. While it is envisaged that these remaining generation units will have their roles in supporting the Government's Climate Action Plan 2050, with the continuous development in decarbonisation technologies, the removal of these units and replacement by alternative facilities is possible. Under the SoC, CAPCO makes a periodic charge to accrue in the statement of financial position a liability balance to be utilised in discharging asset decommissioning costs if and when incurred. CAPCO considers that the dismantling obligation for the CPA units is covered under the asset decommissioning liability accrued under the SoC at 31 December 2023. While no provision for asset retirement obligations for the other generation units of CAPCO has been recognised, it is expected that if such an obligation be incurred, it will be met by the liability accrued and the cost recovery mechanism under the SoC.\n\nAsset retirement obligations of EnergyAustralia at 31 December 2023 amounted to HK$3,544 million (2022: HK$2,982 million) which mainly related to the provision for land remediation and decommissioning of generation assets. The provisions are largely based on estimates by external and internal experts that are discounted using internally determined end of plant lives. The calculation of the provision requires management judgement with respect to estimating the timing of asset removal, costs to remove infrastructure, remediate soil and groundwater, water usage and technological developments. The terms associated with the decommissioning of certain assets including site restoration plans are expected to evolve as plans are refined and agreed with the relevant bodies when approaching plant closure dates. Any future agreements with regulators or changes to regulatory requirements could impact the cost estimates used in the decommissioning provision. On an ongoing basis, we continually review and update underlying assumptions relating to future rehabilitation estimates and timelines.\n\n|                                                              | 2023 HK$M   | 2022 HK$M   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|\n| Asset decommissioning liabilities (Note 25(A)(b))            | 1,575       | 1,463       |\n| Provisions for land remediation and restoration costs (note) | 3,472       | 2,912       |\n|                                                              | 5,047       | 4,375       |\n\nNote: The movements of the balances, including the current portion of HK$72 million (2022: HK$70 million) under the Group's trade payables and other liabilities, are as follows:\n\n|                                    | 2023 HK$M   | 2022 HK$M   |\n|------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|\n| Balance at 1 January               | 2,982       | 2,950       |\n| Effect of changes in discount rate | (163)       | 207         |\n| Additional provisions              | 689         | -           |\n| Amounts used                       | (54)        | (21)        |\n| Unused amounts reversed            | (5)         | -           |\n| Unwinding of discount              | 64          | 46          |\n| Exchange differences               | 31          | (200)       |\n| Balance at 31 December             | 3,544       | 2,982       |",

The redeemable shareholder capital is subordinated, unsecured, interest free and has no fixed terms of repayment. CAPCO can, at its sole discretion, redeem all or part of the redeemable shareholder capital at any time after 31 December 2032.\n\nAs both the perpetual capital securities and redeemable shareholder capital do not contain any contractual obligation to pay cash or other financial assets, in accordance with HKAS 32, they are classified as equity and regarded as part of noncontrolling interests for accounting purpose.\n\n## 30.

The Group's overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise the impact of exchange rate, interest rate and energy price fluctuations on the Group's financial performance. The Group uses different derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure in these areas. All derivative financial instruments are employed solely for hedging purposes.\n\nRisk management for Hong Kong operations is carried out by the Group's central treasury department (Group Treasury) under policies approved by the Board of Directors or the Finance & General Committee of relevant Group entities. Overseas subsidiaries conduct their risk management activities in accordance with policies approved by their respective Boards. Group Treasury identifies, evaluates and monitors financial risks in close co-operation with the Group's operating units. The Group has written policies covering specific areas, such as foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, use of derivative financial instruments and cash management.\n\n## Foreign exchange risk\n\nThe Group operates in the Asia-Pacific region and is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from future commercial transactions, and from recognised assets and liabilities and net investments in foreign operations. This is primarily with respect to Australian dollar and Renminbi. Additionally, the Group has significant foreign currency obligations relating to its foreign currency denominated debts and major capital project payments, US dollar denominated nuclear power purchase offtake commitments and other fuel related payments. The Group uses forward contracts and currency swaps to manage its foreign exchange risk arising from future commercial transactions, and from recognised assets and liabilities which are denominated in a currency that is not the functional currency of the respective Group entity. Hedging is only considered for firm commitments and highly probable forecast transactions.\n\n## SoC Companies\n\nUnder the SoC, the SoC Companies are allowed to pass-through foreign exchange gains and losses arising from future non-capital projects related commercial transactions and recognised liabilities which are denominated in a currency other than Hong Kong dollar, thus retaining no significant foreign exchange risk of such payments over the long term. The SoC Companies use forward contracts and currency swaps to hedge all their debt repayment obligations denominated in foreign currencies for the full tenor, and a significant portion of their US dollar obligations on fuel and nuclear power purchases, provided that for US dollar the hedging can be accomplished at rates below the Hong Kong Government's historical target peg rate of HK$7.8: US$1. The objective is to reduce the potential impact of foreign exchange movement on electricity tariffs. The SoC Companies also use forward contracts to manage the foreign exchange risks arising from non-Hong Kong dollar payment obligations for major capital projects, for which the exchange gains and losses are capitalised.\n\nAt the end of the reporting period, the fair value movement of the derivative financial instruments in a cash flow hedge relationship is recorded in equity. The extent of the impact to the cash flow hedge reserve under equity due to exchange rate movements, with all other variables held constant, is as follows:\n\n|                                                       | 2023 HK$M   | 2022 HK$M   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|\n| Increase / (decrease) in the cash flow hedge reserve  |             |             |\n| Hong Kong dollar against US dollar                    |             |             |\n| If Hong Kong dollar weakened by 0.6% (2022: 0.6%)     | 95          | 107         |\n| If Hong Kong dollar strengthened by 0.6% (2022: 0.6%) | (95)        | (107)       |\n| Hong Kong dollar against Euro                         |             |             |\n| If Hong Kong dollar weakened by 3% (2022: 4%)         | 10          | 23          |\n| If Hong Kong dollar strengthened by 3% (2022: 4%)     | (10)        | (23)        |",

Financial Risk Factors (continued)\n\n## Foreign exchange risk (continued)\n\n## The Group's Asia-Pacific Investments\n\nWith respect to the power project investments in the Asia-Pacific region, the Group is exposed to both foreign currency translation and transaction risks.\n\nThe Group closely monitors translation risk using a Value-at-Risk (VaR) approach but does not hedge foreign currency translation risk because translation gains or losses do not affect the project company's cash flow or the Group's annual profit until an investment is sold. At 31 December 2023, the Group's net investment subject to translation exposure was HK$46,272 million (2022: HK$52,619 million), arising mainly from our investments in Mainland China, Australia, India, and Taiwan Region and Thailand. This means that, for each 1% (2022: 1%) average foreign currency movement, our translation exposure will vary by about HK$463 million (2022: HK$526 million). All the translation exposures are recognised in other comprehensive income and therefore have no impact on the profit or loss.\n\nWe consider that the non-functional currency transaction exposures at the individual project company level, if not managed properly, can lead to significant financial distress. Our primary risk mitigation is therefore to ensure that project-level debt financings are implemented on a local currency basis to the maximum extent possible. Each overseas subsidiary and project company has developed its own hedging programme into local currency taking into consideration any indexing provision in project agreements, tariff reset mechanisms, lender requirements, and tax and accounting implications.\n\nMost foreign currency exposures of the Group entities are hedged and / or their transactions are predominantly conducted through the functional currency of the respective entity. The following analysis presents the Group's (apart from the SoC Companies) sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in the functional currencies of the Group entities against the US dollar and Renminbi, with all other variables held constant. The sensitivity rates in US dollar and Renminbi used are considered reasonable given the current level of exchange rates and the volatility observed in the different functional currencies of the Group entities. These are both on a historical basis and market expectations for future movement at the end of the reporting period and under the economic environments in which the Group operates. The extent of the impact to post-tax profit or equity due to exchange rate movements of US dollar and Renminbi against different functional currencies of Group entities, with all other variables held constant, is as follows:\n\n|                                            | 2023 HK$M   | 2022 HK$M   |\n|--------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|\n| US dollar                                  |             |             |\n| If US dollar strengthened by 4% (2022: 7%) |             |             |\n| Post-tax profit for the year               | -           | -           |\n| Equity - cash flow hedge reserve           | 6           | 20          |\n| If US dollar weakened by 4% (2022: 7%)     |             |             |\n| Post-tax profit for the year               | -           | -           |\n| Equity - cash flow hedge reserve           | (5)         | (17)        |\n| Renminbi                                   |             |             |\n| If Renminbi strengthened by 3% (2022: 5%)  |             |             |\n| Post-tax profit for the year               | 6           | 18          |\n| Equity - cash flow hedge reserve           | -           | -           |\n| If Renminbi weakened by 3% (2022: 5%)      |             |             |\n| Post-tax profit for the year               | (6)         | (18)        |\n| Equity - cash flow hedge reserve           | -           | -           |",

        "page_content": "## 1. Financial Risk Factors (continued)\n\n## Energy portfolio risk\n\nEnergyAustralia's activity in energy markets exposes it to financial risk.\n\nThe electricity market is a competitive power pool. In this market generation supply and retail demand are exposed to spot (5-minute intervals) prices. EnergyAustralia purchases and sells majority of its electricity through the pool, at the same time EnergyAustralia enters into electricity spot-price-linked derivative financial instruments to manage the spot electricity price risk against forecast retail and generation exposures.\n\nThe gas market is a balancing market. To meet retail demand, EnergyAustralia procures gas supply agreements from various gas producers. The contract prices of certain agreements comprise a fixed component, and a variable component that is linked to oil spot prices on the global markets. EnergyAustralia enters into oil-price-linked derivative financial instruments to manage this oil price risk component.\n\nEnergy portfolio exposure is managed through an established risk management framework. The framework consists of policies which place appropriate limits on overall energy market exposures, hedging strategies and targets, delegations of authority on trading, approved product lists, regular exposure reporting, and segregation of duties. The corporate governance process also includes oversight by an Audit & Risk Committee (ARC-EA) which acts on behalf of EnergyAustralia's Board.\n\nRisk monitoring includes physical position reporting, stress testing of the portfolios and 'at-risk' analyses of potential earnings. At-risk measures are derived by modelling potential variability in spot and forward market prices and supply and demand volumes, across the wholesale energy portfolio, through Monte Carlo simulations, historic simulations, and scenarios. Overall Earnings-at-Risk (EaR) exposure for the coming financial year is reported as the 1 in 20 probability downside (2022: 1 in 20 probability downside) of the expected earnings distribution, as simulated with the above methods. The energy portfolio risk exposure for EnergyAustralia at 31 December 2023 was HK$156 million (2022: HK$651 million).\n\n## Interest rate risk\n\nThe Group's interest rate risk arises from borrowings. Borrowings issued at variable rates expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk, and borrowings issued at fixed rates expose the Group to fair value interest rate risk. The risks are managed by monitoring an appropriate mix between fixed and floating rate borrowings, and by the use of interest rate swaps.\n\nThe appropriate level of the fixed / floating mix is determined for each operating company subject to a regular review. For instance, SoC Companies conducts an annual review to determine a preferred fixed / floating interest rate mix appropriate for its business profile. Each overseas subsidiary and project company has developed its own hedging programme taking into consideration project debt service sensitivities to interest rate movements, lender requirements, tax and accounting implications.\n\nThe sensitivity analysis below presents the effects on the Group's post-tax profit for the year (as a result of change in interest expense on floating rate borrowings) and equity (as a result of change in the fair value of derivative instruments which qualify as cash flow hedges). Such amounts accumulated in equity are reclassified to profit or loss in the periods when the hedged items affect profit or loss, and offset one another in the profit or loss.\n\nThe analysis has been determined based on the exposure to interest rates for both derivative and non-derivative financial instruments at the end of the reporting period. For floating rate borrowings, the analysis is prepared assuming the amount of liability outstanding at the end of the reporting period was outstanding for the whole year. The sensitivity to interest rates used is considered reasonable given the market forecasts available at the end of the reporting period and under the economic environments in which the Group operates, with all other variables held constant.",

Good credit ratings from reputable credit rating agencies and scrutiny of the financial position of non-rated counterparties are two important criteria in the selection of counterparties. The credit quality of counterparties will be closely monitored over the life of the transaction. The Group further assigns mark-to-market limits to its financial counterparties to reduce credit risk concentrations relative to the underlying size and credit strength of each counterparty. The Group also monitors potential exposures to each financial institution counterparty. All derivatives transactions are entered into at the sole credit of the respective subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates without recourse to the Company.\n\n## Liquidity risk\n\nPrudent liquidity risk management implies maintaining sufficient cash and making available an adequate amount of committed credit facilities with staggered maturities to reduce refinancing risk in any year and to fund working capital, debt servicing, dividend payments, new investments and close out market positions if required. The Group maintains significant flexibility to respond to opportunities and events by ensuring that committed credit lines are available to meet future funding requirements. In addition, CLP Power will fund its committed contractual maturities through cash flows earned under the terms of the SoC and financing available under its credit lines and MTN programme. Management also monitors rolling forecasts of the Group's undrawn borrowing facilities and cash and cash equivalents on the expected cash flows.",

        "page_content": "## 2. Hedge Accounting\n\nThe Group seeks to apply, wherever possible, hedge accounting to present its financial statements in accordance with the economic purpose of the hedging activity. The Group determines the economic relationship between the hedged items and the hedging instruments by reviewing their critical terms. As a result, the Group concludes that the risk being hedged for the hedged items and the risk inherent in the hedging instruments are sufficiently aligned. There is no inherent mismatch in the hedging relationships. Certain ineffectiveness can arise during the hedging process. The main sources of hedge ineffectiveness are considered to be the effects of re-designation of the hedging relationships and the counterparty credit risks on the hedging instruments.\n\n## Hedges on debt related transactions\n\nThe Group applies various types of derivative financial instruments (forward foreign currency contracts, cross currency interest rate swaps and interest rate swaps) to mitigate exposures arising from the fluctuations in foreign currencies and / or interest rates of debt. In most of the cases, the hedging instruments have a one-to-one hedge ratio with the hedged items. In view of the nature of the hedging activities, no significant ineffectiveness is expected at inception.\n\n## Hedges on non-debt related transactions\n\nThe SoC Companies use forward contracts to manage its foreign exchange risk arising from fuel and nuclear purchases obligations, and payments for major capital projects. The SoC Companies hedge a high portion of committed and highly probable forecast transactions.\n\nEnergyAustralia uses electricity spot-price-linked forward contracts and oil-price-linked forward contracts to mitigate exposures arising from the fluctuations in electricity spot price and oil spot price embedded in gas contracts. In most of the cases, the hedging instruments have a one-to-one hedge ratio with the hedged items.",

Fair Value Estimation and Hierarchy of Financial Instruments\n\nThe fair value of financial instruments traded in active markets (such as publicly traded derivatives) is based on quoted market prices at the end of the reporting period.\n\nThe fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market (for example, over-the-counter derivatives) is determined by using appropriate valuation techniques and making assumptions that are based on market conditions existing at the end of each reporting period.\n\nFor the Group's financial instruments that are not measured at fair value, their carrying values approximate their fair values.\n\nFinancial instruments measured at fair value are analysed into the following fair value measurement hierarchy:\n\nLevel 1 -  quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities\n\nLevel 2 -  inputs, other than quoted prices included within Level 1, that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (that is, as prices) or indirectly (that is, derived from prices)\n\nLevel 3 -  inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (that is, unobservable inputs)\n\n## (A)  Fair value hierarchy\n\nThe following table presents the Group's financial instruments that are measured at fair value at 31 December:\n\n|                                                              | Level 1 HK$M   | Level 2 HK$M   | Level 3 HK$M   | Total HK$M   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|--------------|\n| At 31 December 2023                                          |                |                |                |              |\n| Financial assets                                             |                |                |                |              |\n| Investments at fair value through other comprehensive income | 291            | -

The finance department of EnergyAustralia includes a team that performs the valuations of non-property assets required for financial reporting purposes, including Level 3 fair values. This team reports directly to EnergyAustralia's Chief Financial Officer (CFO-EA) and ARC-EA. The valuation of Level 3 forward energy contracts involves the use of a short-term forward curve which is observable in the liquid market and an internally generated long-term forward electricity price and cap price curve which is derived using unobservable inputs. This short-term forward curve is reviewed at least once every six months, in line with the Group's half-yearly reporting dates. Review of the long-term forward curve is performed by the CFO-EA and ARC-EA annually due to the lack of market liquidity. Analysis of fair value changes is performed on a monthly basis for reasonableness.\n\n|                                                                           | Investments HK$M   | 2023 Energy  Contracts HK$M   | Total HK$M   | Investments HK$M   | 2022 Energy  Contracts HK$M   | Total HK$M   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|-------------------------------|--------------|--------------------|-------------------------------|--------------|\n| Opening balance                                                           | 711                | 1,981                         | 2,692        | 565                | 847                           | 1,412        |\n| Total (losses) / gains recognised in                                      |                    |                               |              |                    |                               |              |\n| Profit or loss and presented in fuel and other  operating expenses (note) | (164)              | 52                            | (112)        | (13)               | 292                           | 279          |\n| Other comprehensive income                                                | (4)                | (456)                         | (460)        | (8)                | 2,265                         | 2,257        |\n| Purchases                                                                 | 102                | -                             | 102          | 167                | -                             | 167          |\n| Distributions / settlements                                               | (24)               | (254)                         | (278)        | -                  | (1,423)                       | (1,423)      |\n| Closing balance                                                           | 621                | 1,323                         | 1,944        | 711                | 1,981                         | 2,692        |\n\nNote: Out of which, unrealised gains recognised in profit or loss relating to the assets and liabilities held at the end of the reporting period was HK$83 million (2022: HK$171 million).",

        "page_content": "## 4. Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (continued)\n\nNotes:\n\n- (a) Under HKFRS, amounts cannot be offset if the rights of set-off are conditional on a future event (e.g. default of payment). 'Net amount' column represents the net impact that would be shown on the consolidated statement of financial position if all set-off rights (e.g. master netting arrangements, collateral arrangements, etc.) were exercised. At 31 December 2023, these items include (1) trade receivables related to Hong Kong electricity business where customers' deposits are served as security for payments; and (2) bank loans and other borrowings of subsidiaries in Mainland China which are secured by charges over trade receivables or rights to income.\n- (b) For derivative financial instruments, the Group enters into derivative transactions under International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) master agreements in which there is a set-off provision. Under certain circumstances, for example, when a credit event such as a default occurs, all outstanding transactions under the agreement are terminated, a termination value is then assessed and only a single net amount is payable in settlement of all transactions. The ISDA agreements do not meet the criteria for offsetting in the consolidated statement of financial position since the Group does not have any currently legally enforceable right to offset recognised amounts. The right to offset is enforceable only on the occurrence of future events such as a default on the bank transactions or other credit events.\n\n## 5. Capital Management\n\nThe primary objective of the Group's capital management is to safeguard the Group's ability to continue as a going concern, maintain a strong credit rating and a healthy capital ratio to support the business and to enhance shareholder value.\n\nThe Group manages its capital structure and fine-tunes it in light of changes in economic conditions and business strategies. To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the dividend payments to shareholders, issue new shares or change the level of debts. The Group's capital management objectives, policies or processes were unchanged during 2023 and 2022.\n\nThe Group monitors capital using 'total debt to total capital' and 'net debt to total capital' ratios. These ratios are as follows:\n\n|                                                             | 2023 HK$M   | 2022 HK$M   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|\n| Total debt  (a)                                             | 57,515      | 59,217      |\n| Net debt  (b)                                               | 52,311      | 54,931      |\n| Total equity  (c)                                           | 112,971     | 116,554     |\n| Total capital (based on total debt)  (d)                    | 170,486     | 175,771     |\n| Total capital (based on net debt)  (e)                      | 165,282     | 171,485     |\n| Total debt to total capital (based on total debt) ratio (%) | 33.7        | 33.7        |\n| Net debt to total capital (based on net debt) ratio (%)     | 31.6        | 32.0        |\n\nDecrease in the net debt to total capital was driven by lower net debt from strong operating cash inflows in 2023.\n\nCertain entities of the Group are subject to loan covenants. For both 2023 and 2022, there is no material non-compliance with those loan covenants.\n\n## Notes:",

        "page_content": "## Scheme of Control Statement\n\n## CLP Power Hong Kong Limited and Castle Peak Power Company Limited\n\n## Overview\n\nIn Hong Kong, CLP Power Hong Kong Limited (CLP Power) operates a vertically integrated electricity generation, transmission and distribution business. The generating plants in Hong Kong are owned by Castle Peak Power Company Limited (CAPCO), in which CLP Power owned 70%. CLP Power builds and operates CAPCO's power stations under contract and is the sole customer for CAPCO's electricity which CLP Power transmits and distributes to its customers in Kowloon, New Territories and most of the outlying islands. CLP Power owns the transmission and distribution network.\n\nSince financial year 1964, the electricity-related operations of CLP Power and CAPCO (the SoC Companies) have been governed by a Scheme of Control (SoC) Agreement with the Hong Kong Government. The SoC specifies the SoC Companies' obligations to supply adequate and reliable electricity supplies to customers at the lowest reasonable cost and the mechanism for the Hong Kong Government to monitor their financial affairs and operating performance. In return, CLP Power is allowed to charge tariffs designed to recover the operating costs (including tax) and allowed net return of the SoC Companies.\n\nThe current SoC took effect from 1 October 2018 and covers a term of over 15 years ending on 31 December 2033. The SoC contains a provision to give the SoC Companies protection for stranded costs, which may arise as a result of future changes to the market structure which adversely impact on the SoC Companies' ability to recover and to earn returns on existing investments made in good faith in accordance with the SoC. These costs will include the costs of investments, fuel and power purchase agreements previously approved by the Hong Kong Government. If stranded costs arise after the SoC Companies have implemented mitigation measures reasonably required by the Hong Kong Government, the SoC Companies are entitled to recover them from the market, consistent with international practice. Three years before market changes are introduced, the SoC Companies and the Hong Kong Government will agree on the amount of stranded costs and the mechanism for their recovery by the SoC Companies.\n\n## Tariff Setting Mechanism\n\nFor each year, CLP Power designs the total tariff it charges to cover the SoC Companies' operating costs and allowed net return. The total tariff consists of the following components:\n\n- (i) basic tariff rate which is derived by taking into account the annual forecast of (a), (b) and (c) below, using the formula '(a-b) / c':\n- (a) the allowed net return and operating costs including the standard cost of fuels; generation, transmission, distribution and administration expenses; depreciation; interest expenses; and taxes;\n- (b) 80% of the profit on electricity sales to Mainland China; and\n- (c) local unit sales as determined by the load forecast.\n- (ii) fuel clause charge or rebate (Fuel Cost Adjustment) which represents the difference between the cost of fuels (including natural gas, coal and oil) and the standard cost recovered through the basic tariff rate. The Fuel Cost Adjustment may be adjusted from time to time, including on a monthly basis, to reflect changes in the cost of fuels consumed by the SoC Companies for the generation of electricity.\n\nAny difference between the actual profit for SoC operations and the permitted return for the year is transferred to or from a Tariff Stabilisation Fund. The Tariff Stabilisation Fund does not form part of distributable shareholders' funds and represents a liability in the accounts of CLP Power. A charge on the average balance of the Tariff Stabilisation Fund is credited to a Rate Reduction Reserve in the accounts of CLP Power, which balance as at the end of each year is to be transferred to the Tariff Stabilisation Fund in the following year.",

These provisions state that each company will receive that proportion of the total net return represented by the net return that company would receive if it were the only company under the SoC and the net return were calculated solely on the basis of its own financial statements.\n\nUnder the SoC, 65% of the energy efficiency incentives earned by the SoC Companies are to be contributed to a CLP Community Energy Saving Fund (CESF) to support programmes in promotion of energy efficiency, use of renewable energy, the disadvantaged groups and other programmes as agreed with the Hong Kong Government. In addition, a new mechanism to provide additional financial support (special tariff relief) by the SoC Companies in the event of severe international fuel crisis capped at HK$180 million has become effective from 2024 to help targeted residential customers most in need of support.\n\nThe calculations shown on next page are in accordance with the SoC and the agreements between the SoC Companies.",

of businesses, including generation and energy storage portfolio, transmission and distribution, retail and others.\n- 2 Numbers have been subject to rounding. Any discrepancies between the total shown and the sum of the amounts listed are due to rounding.\n- 3 Paguthan Power Station, the power purchase agreements of which expired in December 2018, was not included in the 2019-2023 numbers.\n- 4 In accordance with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol, WE Station, which makes use of landfill gas from waste for power generation, is not included in CLP's Scope 1 CO\u2082 emissions and is reported separately in the Asset Performance Statistics of the Sustainability Report. Its non-CO\u2082 GHG emissions (i.e. CH 4 and N\u2082O) are included in CLP's Scope 1 CO\u2082e emissions.\n- 5 Starting from 2020, the portfolio includes energy storage assets and generation assets. Energy storage assets include pumped storage and battery storage. In previous years, the portfolio included generation assets only.\n- 6 Numbers include Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions.\n- 7 Numbers include Scope 1, Scope 2 and Scope 3 Category 3 emissions (direct emissions from generation of purchased electricity that is sold to CLP's customers).\n- 8 Apraava Energy ceased to be a subsidiary and is now accounted for as a joint venture. Apraava Energy is excluded in the figures for 2023, but included in figures for 2022 and prior years. Moreover, in November 2022, CLP sold its 70% interest in the coal-fired Fangchenggang Power Station, which has been excluded from CLP's reporting scope since then.\n- 9 Numbers include operating assets where CLP has operational control during the calendar year. Paguthan Power Station, the power purchase agreements of which expired in December 2018, was not included in the 2019-2023 numbers.\n- 10  Waste categorised in accordance with local regulations.",
