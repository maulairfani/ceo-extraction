She was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes aged seven and was discriminated against because of it. People in her community said she could not go to school or be active, and expectations of what she would achieve in life were low. She decided to prove them wrong. After graduating, Quresha co-founded a start-up developing a non-invasive blood sugar monitoring device. She also launched 'Diabetes Champions', an organisation that empowers young girls with diabetes. When you educate a girl, she says, you educate a whole community.\n\nWatch Quresha's full story here",

As we reflect on 100 years of driving change to defeat serious chronic diseases, we nevertheless acknowledge that what got us here will not be enough to take us where we want to go.\n\nThe choices we make at this pivotal moment for our company are key to shaping our long-term vision - one that extends beyond strengthening leadership positions in our core therapy areas to becoming a driving force for improving human health worldwide.\n\nAs our business continues to grow, so does our role in society. The global burden of serious chronic diseases casts a long shadow, and demands innovative, disruptive solutions that are as sustainable as they are impactful. Our core contribution to this fight remains our industryleading therapeutic innovations, which benefited more than 40 million people living with serious chronic diseases in 2023. Yet we are also increasingly focused on prevention as we seek to understand and address the root causes of the diseases we treat.\n\nThe unmet needs in type 2 diabetes and obesity are growing by the day, and the rising prevalence of these closely related threats to global health has created surging demand for our GLP-1-based therapies. This has enabled us to reach more patients than at any point in our 100-year history, contributing to strong sales growth across North America and International Operations. However, it has also increased pressure on our supply chain, resulting in periodic constraints across our portfolio as we strive to keep pace with demand.\n\nWe have responded by investing heavily in expanding our production capacity with the aim of serving millions more patients worldwide. In 2023 alone, we announced investments totalling more than DKK 75 billion",

With construction now underway on these projects, we strive to operate our existing facilities 24 hours a day, seven days a week, as we produce more of our life-changing medicines than ever before.\n\nOur response to supply challenges does not stop there. We are also changing the way we launch and distribute our products, making sure we do this in a responsible manner with a clear focus on safeguarding access to appropriate treatment options for our existing patients. Recent examples of this refined approach include the launches of Wegovy \u00ae in the UK and Germany, where we are collaborating with health authorities to ensure that some of those in greatest need of medical intervention can access our flagship obesity therapy.\n\nImproving health equity remains a cornerstone of our commitment to patients, and we are working hard to enhance access to care worldwide. Our new production partnership with manufacturer Aspen Pharmaceuticals in South Africa will significantly increase the supply of affordable insulin to the African continent, while long-established initiatives, including Changing Diabetes \u00ae in Children and our Access to Insulin Commitment, continue to support vulnerable patients in low- and middle-income countries. In the US, a growing number of people living with serious chronic diseases have been able to access our expanded range of affordability offerings, which include unbranded biologics, low-cost human insulin and our Patient Assistance Program.\n\nDespite these efforts, the burden of chronic diseases on healthcare systems is only set to grow, pushing us to break new ground in our pursuit of innovative treatments. To this end, we are building a pipeline of considerable breadth and depth, powered by the interplay between our world-class in-house R&D capabilities and an increasing focus on external innovation and business development. Our distinct ownership structure, with the Novo Nordisk Foundation retaining the majority vote, gives us the security we need to take a long-term perspective on our investments and strategies.\n\nThe past year has seen us make significant progress on our pipeline. The SELECT trial showed that semaglutide 2.4 mg reduces the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events by 20% in people with obesity compared to placebo, prompting us to seek label updates for Wegovy \u00ae , while the FLOW kidney outcomes trial for semaglutide closed early following a positive analysis of interim data. Novel combination therapy CagriSema entered phase 3 development in both type 2 diabetes and obesity, and insulin icodec, potentially the world's first once-weekly basal insulin, is pending regulatory approval. We have also expanded our footprint in cardiovascular disease with the acquisition of ocedurenone for uncontrolled hypertension, and bolstered our late-stage pipeline in rare blood disorders with phase 3 trials of Mim8 in haemophilia and etavopivat in sickle cell disease.\n\nFurthermore, we continue to reap the rewards of recent partnerships and investments in novel technology platforms, with our first-ever RNA interference-derived therapy, Rivfloza\u2122, now approved in the US. The recent expansion of our R&D presence in the Greater Boston area - a world-renowned life sciences cluster - will potentially open the door to even more collaboration opportunities as we seek to accelerate our drug discovery and development efforts.\n\nNevertheless, we understand that it will take more than medicine to transition from a disease-focused company to one that prioritises broader human health to the benefit of society at large. Leveraging a decade's worth of insights from our pioneering Cities Changing Diabetes programme, we are enhancing our prevention efforts, expanding our partnership with UNICEF to address childhood obesity, and establishing a Transformational Prevention Unit to deliver scalable, preventive solutions to the obesity pandemic.\n\nInnovation plays an equally important role in our ambition to reach net zero emissions across our entire value chain by 2045 - particularly with our manufacturing output at an all-time high. Having already switched our production sites to sourcing 100% renewable power, we are now\n\nsupporting a similar transition among our 60,000-plus network of suppliers, with the aim of significantly cutting carbon emissions across our supply chain.\n\nThe resilience and dedication of our growing global workforce have been instrumental in scaling our operations in the face of unprecedented demand. As we onboard more colleagues than ever before, we are focusing on making Novo Nordisk a more diverse and inclusive place to work, nurturing a culture built on openness, accountability and respect. Above all, we remain a purpose-driven company, guided by a clear ambition to drive change to defeat serious chronic diseases, building on our heritage in diabetes. Our position today in the vanguard of progressive global businesses is a testament to the strength and longevity of that purpose - and to the drive and motivation it provides for our people all over the world.\n\nWe would like to extend our gratitude to all colleagues for their unwavering commitment and invaluable contributions during a particularly demanding year, and to our shareholders for their continued support of our company.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Guided by our purpose of driving change to defeat serious chronic diseases and a steadfast commitment to social, environmental and financial responsibility, we are raising the bar to stay at the forefront of progressive global businesses.\n\nHuman health is under threat from a perfect storm of health inequity, climate change and biodiversity loss. As a leading healthcare company committed to serving patients across the globe, we have an important role to play in addressing these challenges. Our commitment to social responsibility and minimising our environmental impact are key to achieving our purpose and sustainability goals - and essential for our long-term success.\n\nThat is why we are striving to improve access to affordable care for vulnerable patients across the globe. More than three quarters of people with diabetes, for example, live in low- and middle-income countries, and that proportion is likely to grow as global prevalence rises from an estimated 537 million adults today to a predicted 643 million by 2030. Although we are now serving more people with diabetes than ever before, expanding our reach by more than four million patients to a total of 40.5 million last year, we recognise the need to do more.\n\nOur key contribution to society remains our therapeutic innovation. However, we realise it will take more than medicine to defeat serious chronic diseases. This need is particularly acute in obesity, where medical intervention with treatments\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nlike Wegovy \u00ae must be supplemented with prevention measures to head off a global pandemic that threatens to overwhelm healthcare systems. To this end, we have strengthened our focus on public-private partnerships and established a dedicated Transformational Prevention Unit tasked with delivering scalable commercial solutions that can help predict and pre-empt obesity.\n\nWe are also stepping up efforts to reduce our environmental impact by focusing on our supply chain emissions. Having already switched our production sites to sourcing 100% renewable power in 2020, we are now focused on supporting our 60,000-plus suppliers through a similar transition, with the aim of reaching net zero emissions across our full value chain by 2045.\n\nTo ensure that sustainability is integrated into Novo Nordisk's core business, we have a series of governance measures in place that supplement the incorporation of environmental, social and financial responsibility in our Articles of Association. These include our Sustainability Advisory Council, established in 2022, which provides external input on our goals from experts in academia, public policy and patient advocacy, and an executive remuneration package directly linked to our progress on sustainability targets.\n\nSTRATEGIC ASPIRATIONS 2025\n\n- 1.  Progress towards zero environmental impact\n- 2.  Being respected for adding value to society\n- 3.  Being recognised as a sustainable employer\n\nFor an overview of our purpose and sustainability initiatives, frameworks and performance, see the tables on pages 102-104.",

This assessment considers both the impact of Novo Nordisk's business on society and the environment (impact materiality) and how ESG matters affect the company (financial materiality). The assessment involved experts and leaders from within Novo Nordisk, as well as input from external stakeholders, such as patient organisations, suppliers and investors.\n\nThe purpose of the assessment is to prepare for the implementation of the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) in 2024. It covers all topics defined in the CSRD, along with other ESG topics relevant to Novo Nordisk. The table on the right shows the preliminary, aggregated results of the assessment, and includes both current and potential ESG topics from a short-, medium- and long-term perspective. The ESG topics will help guide the preparation of the company's ESG reporting from 2024 onwards.\n\nMany of the preliminary, material ESG topics reflect Novo Nordisk's strategic sustainability focus. For social topics, this includes our efforts to provide access to life-saving medicines without compromising safety or quality, improve patients' quality of life and support resilient healthcare systems. Workers' wellbeing, both within and outside of our operations, reflects the importance of remaining a relevant and attractive workplace while respecting adequate working conditions. We also consider our local impact in the communities we operate in and pay tax where value is created.\n\nThe preliminary, material environmental topics reflect Novo Nordisk's environmental initiatives to reduce carbon emissions and promote a circular economy, for example on plastic. ESG topics such as biodiversity and water reflect the company's dependence on nature-based resources. To this end, Novo Nordisk is already increasing sustainability efforts directly related to nature and biodiversity. Moreover, the company strives to limit any negative effects resulting from its business operations, including pollution.\n\nBusiness conduct reflects our efforts to adhere to the highest ethical standards, including bioethics. Overall, Novo Nordisk aims to be respected for its contributions to society and to build trust through its sustainability efforts.\n\n## Preliminary assessment of material ESG topics\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Climate change                     | Patient protection 1 and quality of life   | Business conduct   |\n|------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|--------------------|\n| Resource use and  circular economy | Own workers                                | Bioethics          |\n| Water and marine                   | Workers in the                             |                    |\n| Biodiversity and  ecosystems       | Sustainable                                |                    |\n| Pollution                          | tax Affected                               |                    |\n\n<!-- image -->",

We recognise that caring for our patients also means caring for our planet, and with the healthcare sector as a whole accounting for approximately 5% of global emissions, we take our environmental impact seriously. We are determined to play our part in creating a sustainable, healthy environment for the long term, and our ambition is bold and simple: to have zero environmental impact.\n\nTo achieve this, one of our key tasks is to decouple the growth in our business from our CO 2 equivalent (CO 2 e) emissions; otherwise, our carbon footprint will continue to climb as we serve increasing numbers of patients.\n\n'Focusing solely on our own activities is not enough. We must also ensure our 60,000-plus suppliers play their part in this transformation.'\n\nOn this front, we have made significant progress in curbing our company's emissions. Since 2020, all our production sites have sourced 100% renewable power and we aim to reach zero CO 2 e emissions from operations and transportation by 2030.\n\nHowever, focusing solely on our own activities is not enough. We must also ensure our 60,000-plus suppliers play their part in this transformation, since their activities account for the majority of our total CO 2 e emissions - amounting to 98% in 2023. Our target is that all goods and services from suppliers will be based on 100% sourced renewable power by 2030.\n\nWe are engaging with suppliers in high-impact areas to understand how we can collectively reduce emissions using novel approaches to decarbonisation. This involves working on innovative Power-to-X solutions that use renewable electricity to produce green fuels and low-carbon chemicals, or using organic waste materials to produce biofuels.\n\nRecent examples include our membership of the Sustainable Aviation Buyers Alliance (SABA) to support the expansion of sustainable aviation fuel facilities, and our partnership with global logistics firm Maersk on low-emission fuels for ocean freight. Both these investments are contributing to the global uptake of innovative green technologies.\n\n## SCOPE 1, 2 AND 3 EMISSIONS IN 2023 (1,000 tonnes CO2e)\n\n- Scope 1: Direct emissions from owned or controlled sources\n\nScope 2:\n\nIndirect emissions from the\n\ngeneration of energy purchased\n\nfrom an utility provider\n\n- Scope 3: All indirect emissions - not included in scope 2 - that occur upstream and downstream in our value chain\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTarget 2045: net zero CO2e emissions across our full value chain\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 1.

We currently manufacture more than 800 million pre-filled plastic pens every year, equivalent to some 14,000 tonnes of plastic. As the number of patients we serve continues to grow, those numbers will rise markedly unless we take decisive action.\n\nWe are tackling our plastic challenge on multiple fronts, with a threefold 'reduce-change-avoid' approach. This includes reducing plastic consumption by converting to reusable devices, changing to the use of non-virgin-fossil plastics in our device production and harnessing recycling to avoid plastic ending up in landfill.\n\n'In 2023 we established the world's first industry solution for recycling injection pens in Denmark.'\n\nThe task is not simple. When it comes to recycling, for example, used injection pens cannot be dealt with in the same way as other household recycling because they are classified as medical waste, which most countries are not equipped to handle. To address this challenge, we have expanded a series\n\nof pioneering take-back programmes across Denmark, the UK, France and Brazil, and in 2023 we established the world's first industry solution for recycling injection pens in Denmark. Pharmaceutical companies Lilly, Sanofi and Merck have all joined the initiative, and we now share a goal of recycling 25% of the pens distributed by all four companies in Denmark within the first 12 months.\n\nAnother important initiative involves rethinking medicine delivery by switching from disposable to reusable devices some with an expected lifespan of up to 5 years. Over the past year, we have converted selected products in a number of countries and we expect to switch more in 2024. We are also steadily building device durability into the development of new medicines and expect that a trend from daily to once-weekly administration for many products will contribute to reduced plastic use per patient in the long term.\n\nIn addition, we are exploring more sustainable ways to produce plastic. A good example is a new agreement signed by Novo Nordisk, alongside the LEGO Group, to buy e-methanol from European Energy when the world's first large-scale production plant for the commodity starts up in Denmark in 2024. The e-methanol - made from renewable electricity, water and captured biogenic CO 2 - will help us to create lower-carbon plastics for use in our medical devices.",

Last year, we reached more than 40.5 million people with our diabetes medicines - an increase of 4.2 million on 2022 - but we recognise the need to do more. For that reason, we are committed to improving affordability for vulnerable populations, increasing availability by strengthening supply chains and expanding the capacity to diagnose and manage diabetes worldwide.\n\nOver the past year, we reached 6.7 million people living with diabetes globally with our insulin medicines through access and affordability initiatives, and we extended support to more than 52,000 children with type 1 diabetes through our Changing Diabetes \u00ae in Children programme. In the US, we provided access to affordable insulin for 1.4 million people and supported a further 2.8 million with initiatives relating to our GLP-1-based therapies.\n\nOn the African continent, we doubled down on our commitment to improve access to insulin, establishing a new partnership with South African pharmaceutical manufacturer Aspen Pharmaceuticals to increase production for distribution across the region. The partnership acknowledges the World Health Organization's call for sustainable access to quality-assured and affordable medicine through local manufacture and aims to produce more than 60 million vials by 2026. This is equivalent to the annual requirements\n\nof around four million people - a significant increase on the 500,000 we currently serve. Sub-Saharan Africa is currently home to an estimated 24 million adults living with diabetes.\n\nThe human insulin produced by the collaboration will be distributed at low-cost as part of Novo Nordisk's Access to Insulin commitment, which reached 2.4 million people in 2023. The programme guarantees a ceiling price of USD 3 per vial in 77 low- and middle-income countries around the world.\n\nHowever, increasing the availability of insulin alone is not enough. To enhance access to equitable care in Sub-Saharan Africa, we have built a business integrated model - iCARE - which is now active in 49 countries. Through public-private partnerships we aim to improve capacity to treat diabetes, increase affordability of insulin and enhance patient empowerment. Our ambition is to reach more than two million vulnerable people living with diabetes in Sub-Saharan Africa by 2030.\n\nPEOPLE REACHED WITH OUR DIABETES MEDICINES (million)\n\n32.8 30.0 2019\n\n2020\n\n36.3 34.6 2021\n\n2022\n\n40.5\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2023",

In addition, obesity impacts the sustainability of health systems and economic productivity. While Novo Nordisk's core contribution to the fight remains our therapeutic innovations, which reached more than 1.1 million people worldwide in 2023, we recognise that medicine alone will never be enough to defeat obesity. We are therefore committed to addressing the disease holistically by scaling up our focus on prevention - and nowhere is this more urgent than in childhood.\n\nMore than 310 million children and adolescents are expected to be living with obesity by 2030, with those in vulnerable settings more at risk. These individuals are more likely to develop earlyonset type 2 diabetes, and their weight in early life can also be a strong predictor of adult obesity and cardiometabolic disease.\n\nWe believe that preventing childhood obesity is a shared societal responsibility that requires systemic change. Many of the risk factors driving the epidemic are outside of an individual's control, reflecting rapid urbanisation and the health challenges that come in its wake, from physical inactivity to the prevalence of foods high in fats, sugar and salt.\n\nOur childhood obesity partnership with UNICEF - which was expanded in 2023 and aims to reach 10 million children across\n\nthe globe - zeroes in on exactly these key issues through policies, programmes and practices that directly impact the nutrition, wellbeing and development of children.\n\nSince its launch in 2019, the partnership has positively impacted the lives of more than 2.7 million children and caregivers across Latin America and the Caribbean. Now it is expanding its reach, bringing its proven approach to new geographies with an increased focus on driving policy change at national level and action at city level.\n\nThrough local engagement and cross-sector collaboration, we are focusing on interventions with demonstrable track records. These include advocating for healthy school food regulations in Brazil, addressing unhealthy food marketing directed at children online in Mexico and trialling innovative measures to improve urban food retail environments in Indonesia.\n\nThe partnership will draw upon insights from our Cities Changing Diabetes programme, now active in 47 cities globally, which over the past decade has addressed the systemic issues underpinning the rise in type 2 diabetes and obesity in urban environments. Our broader obesity prevention efforts will be boosted by our recently-established Transformational Prevention Unit, a semi-autonomous team of multi-disciplinary experts tasked with delivering high-impact, scalable and accessible solutions that can predict and pre-empt obesity and its consequences.",

In our rapidly growing organisation, we aim to create an inclusive culture where all employees feel valued and are given equal opportunities to realise their potential and where, together, we better reflect the diversity of the patients and communities we serve. Encouraging diverse perspectives and promoting inclusive leadership adds value to Novo Nordisk by bringing out the best in our people, fostering new ideas and sparking innovation.\n\nOur aim is to achieve balanced gender representation across all managerial levels, with a minimum of 45% women and 45% men in senior leadership roles by the end of 2025. There is still work to be done but we are making significant progress. At the end of 2023, 41% of senior leadership positions were filled by women, compared to 39% one year earlier.\n\nGender is only one element of diversity, and we want to build a more representative workforce across all dimensions, including ethnicity, race, age, nationality, disability status and sexual orientation - not to mention diversity of thought. We are committed to including these important parameters globally as we embed them into our people processes and the employee experience, from initial attraction and recruitment through to talent development and leadership training.\n\nIn the context of the rapid growth of our global organisation, this is no small feat. We added more than nine thousand employees to Novo Nordisk in 2023, and have gone to great lengths to sharpen our focus on onboarding and upskilling our new colleagues into their new roles, nurturing a workplace culture built upon foundational values of openness, accountability and respect. We measure our success in this regard by tracking employee engagement via a yearly all-company Evolve survey, recording an overall engagement score of 86% in 2023 - up from 85% in 2022 and placing us in the top quartile of Most Engaged Companies for the first time.\n\n## WOMEN IN LEADERSHIP (%)\n\n|                       |   2019 |   2020 |   2021 |   2022 |   2023 |\n|-----------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| EVP/SVP               |     18 |     24 |     28 |     29 |     36 |\n| CVP                   |     33 |     37 |     39 |     40 |     41 |\n| VP                    |     35 |     36 |     36 |     40 |     42 |\n| Senior leadership     |     33 |     35 |     36 |     39 |     41 |\n| Director              |     43 |     41 |     44 |     44 |     47 |\n| Manager and team lead |     40 |     42 |     43 |     45 |     46 |\n| All leaders           |     40 |     41 |     43 |     44 |     46 |\n\n<!-- image -->",

Since diversity remains important for the Board, it has maintained a voluntary 2025 target of having at least three shareholderelected Board members who are men and three who are women.\n\nAs of 31 December 2023, the share of the underrepresented gender in upper management at Novo Nordisk A/S is 42%. Accordingly, we have achieved equal gender representation as defined under the Danish companies act. However, we have not yet achieved the targeted level of 45% and therefore maintain our diversity and inclusion policy to keep making progress. This policy states our strong belief that diversity and\n\ninclusion brings value to the company, by enabling a diverse line of thought, increasing innovation and leading to better decision-making.\n\nThe policy focuses on three primary drivers: mitigating bias, creating an inclusive workplace and having leaders serve as role models. Its most significant activities include yearly equal pay reviews, a global genderneutral parental leave policy, tracking of gender representation across all managerial levels and aspirational gender diversity targets.\n\nFurther reporting on diversity and inclusion is included in note 8.3 on Gender diversity, and for the Board of Directors, also in the Corporate Governance Report. Novo Nordisk's diversity and inclusion policy is available at: www.novonordisk.com/sustainable-business/esg-portal/ principles-positions-and-policies/diversity-inclusion-policy.html.\n\n## Sustainable tax approach\n\nOur overall guiding principle within taxation is to have a sustainable tax approach, emphasising our business-anchored approach to managing the impact of taxes while remaining true to the Novo Nordisk values of operating our business in a responsible and transparent manner. Our legal structures are based on business-anchored considerations and substance.\n\nConsequently, we pay tax where value is generated and always respect international and domestic tax rules. As a global business, we conduct cross-border trading, which is subject to transfer pricing regulations. We apply a 'Principal structure' in line with OECD principles, meaning all legal entities, except for the principals, perform their functions under contract on behalf of the principals. As a result, entities contracted by the principals are being allocated an activity-based profit according to a benchmarked profit margin. The tax outcome of this operational model is reflected in the overview to the right, which shows our corporate income taxes by region.\n\nTo ensure alignment between tax authorities regarding the allocation of profit between our entities, we aim to have Advance Pricing Agreements and similar tax rulings in place for geographies representing around 70% of our revenue worldwide.\n\nOur tax policy has been approved by the Board of Directors. Read more about this at: www.novonordisk.com/sustainable-business/esg-portal/ principles-positions-and-policies/tax-policy.html.\n\nIn addition to corporate income taxes, we also pay other taxes. Please refer to note 8.7 on Total tax contribution for further information.\n\n## TAXES BY REGION (THREE-YEAR AVERAGE 2021-2023)\n\n| Region                   | Intellectual  property  rights 6   | Production 7   | Sales 8   |   Corporate  income taxes  (DKK billion) |   Total tax   contribution  (DKK billion) |\n|--------------------------|------------------------------------|----------------|-----------|------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|\n| International Operations |                                    |                |           |                                     14.2 |                                      32.8 |\n| Denmark                  |                                    |                |           |                                     12.2 |                                      21.6 |\n| EMEA (excluding Denmark) |                                    |                |           |                                      1   |                                       5.4 |\n| China                    |                                    |                |           |                                      0.6 |                                       2.6 |\n| Rest of the world        |                                    |                |           |                                      0.4 |                                       3.2 |\n| North America Operations |                                    |                |           |                                      1.1 |                                       7.1 |\n| US                       |                                    |                |           |                                      1   |                                       7   |\n| Total three-year average |                                    |                |           |                                     15.3 |                                      39.9 |\n\nMinor or no activities\n\nShare of category\n\n<!-- image -->",

In the face of unprecedented demand for our medicines - particularly our GLP-1-based therapies - we have also strengthened our focus on ensuring that only the approved indications of our products are promoted.\n\nAt times, however, we were challenged in our aspirations. In the UK, for example, we received a two-year suspension from The Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry (ABPI) in 2023 after the trade body found Novo Nordisk to be in breach of the industry's self-regulatory code of practice. The breach related to the provision of insufficient information regarding our sponsorship of a weight management course offered by a third-party clinical training provider for healthcare professionals.\n\nWhen mistakes are made, we learn from them. Over the past year, we invested substantial resources in robust training for colleagues with the aim of ensuring we always deliver the right message, whether we are addressing the general public or healthcare professionals. We have also strengthened our governance processes in key affiliates via local ethics and\n\n## The Novo Nordisk Way Essentials\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- We create value by having a patient-centred business approach.\n- We set ambitious goals and are empowered to achieve them.\n- We are accountable for our financial, environmental 3\n\nand social performance.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- We are curious and innovate for the benefit of patients and society at large. 4\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- We build and maintain good relations with our stakeholders.\n- We value diversity and treat everyone 6\n- with respect.\n\nWe focus on performance and personal development.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- We have a healthy and engaging working environment. 8\n- We strive for agility and simplicity 9\n\nin everything we do.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- We never compromise on quality and ethics. 10\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ncompliance committees, and we are ready to step up our monitoring efforts by significantly increasing the number of internal checks and reviews in 2024.\n\nMore broadly, our new global code of conduct sets out the fundamental principles and required behaviours for our employees and collaborators and is rooted firmly in the Novo Nordisk Way Essentials - a foundational set of guiding principles that shape and inform everything we do. We use a unique, systematic approach known as facilitation to ensure everyone lives up to these Essentials. In 2023, 42 units and approximately 2,300 employees were facilitated, compared to 36 units and 1,700 employees in 2022. Any issues are addressed locally, and a consolidated report is shared with the Board of Directors and Executive Management.\n\nWe also measure the extent to which we live up to societies' expectations through several other governing processes. These include our company reputation score among key stakeholders (see pages 41-42 for more information), regular product quality and supplier audits, and an enduring commitment to ensuring the accuracy of our financial and ESG reporting via both internal and external audit processes. Our financial reporting and associated processes are audited according to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act by an independent audit firm elected at the Annual General Meeting, and we voluntarily include an Assurance Report from an independent external auditor for ESG reporting in the Annual Report.",

The general meeting inter alia adopts the company's Articles of Association, approves the Annual Report and elects the Board of Directors.\n\nAny shareholder has the right to raise questions at general meetings. Resolutions can generally be passed by a simple majority. However, resolutions to amend the Articles of Association require two-thirds of the votes cast and capital represented, unless other adoption requirements are imposed by the Danish Companies Act.\n\nNovo Nordisk has a two-tier management structure consisting of the Board of Directors and Executive Management. The governance structure and rules of Novo Nordisk are further described in our Articles of Association and our Corporate Governance Report, both available at: www.novonordisk.com.\n\n## Foundation ownership\n\nNovo Holdings A/S, a Danish company wholly owned by the Novo Nordisk Foundation, holds the majority of votes at Novo Nordisk A/S' general meetings. The combination of foundation ownership and stock listing enables Novo Nordisk to embark on long-term sustainable strategies while maintaining short-term transparency on performance. Our foundation ownership supports the overarching imperative to be both commercially successful and responsive to the wider needs of society.\n\nThe objectives of the Novo Nordisk Foundation are to provide a stable basis for the commercial and research activities of Novo Nordisk and Novozymes, and to support scientific, humanitarian and social causes. Please refer to the section about value creation on page 7. For more information about the ownership structure of Novo Nordisk, see page 38.\n\n## Corporate Governance reporting\n\nNovo Nordisk reports in accordance with the Danish Corporate Governance Recommendations designated by Nasdaq Copenhagen as well as the Corporate Governance Standards of the New York Stock Exchange applicable to foreign private issuers.\n\nIn 2023, Novo Nordisk complied with the Danish Corporate Governance Recommendations as we either complied with or explained our approach to the recommendations. You can find further information about our corporate governance practices in our 2023 Corporate Governance Report, in accordance with section 107b of the Danish Financial Statements Act, available at: www.novonordisk.com/about/corporate-governance.html.\n\n## Remuneration\n\nExecutive remuneration is linked to performance on financials as well as non-financials (e.g. innovation, sustainability). Novo Nordisk has prepared a separate Remuneration Report describing the remuneration awarded or due during 2023 to the Board of Directors and Executives registered with the Danish Business Authority. The Remuneration Report is submitted to the Annual General Meeting for an advisory vote. The Remuneration Policy and the Remuneration Report are available at: www.novonordisk.com/about/corporate-governance.html.\n\n## Disclosure regarding change of control provisions\n\nThe EU Takeover Bids Directive 1 , as partially implemented by the Danish Financial Statements Act, requires listed companies to disclose information that may be of interest to the market and potential take-over bidders, in particular in relation to disclosure of change-ofcontrol provisions in material contracts.\n\nIt is disclosed that Novo Nordisk does not have any material contracts that take effect, alter or terminate upon a change of control of Novo Nordisk following implementation of a takeover bid. In relation to the registered management of Novo Nordisk A/S, the current employment contracts allow for severance payments of up to 24 months' fixed base salary plus pension contributions in the event of a merger, acquisition or takeover of Novo Nordisk.\n\n## Data ethics\n\nNovo Nordisk has adopted a set of data ethics principles to support ethical decision-making when using data. In 2023, we trained employees in our Data Ethics Principles, which were expanded to identify and address risks related to artificial intelligence. You can read more about these principles, in accordance with the Danish Financial Statements Act Section 99d, at: www.novonordisk.com/data-privacy-and-user-rights/data-ethics.html.\n\n<!-- image -->",

To achieve this objective and integrate sustainability considerations in Novo Nordisk's strategy and core business, ESG is anchored and discussed in relevant governance bodies across the organisation.\n\nOur ESG Governance model includes the Board of Directors' and Board Committees' oversight and advice on ESG matters such as strategic direction and ambition level, as set by Executive Management. Their oversight also includes approval of our ESG reporting, variable remuneration components and more.\n\nOperational decisions are anchored at the executive level in the Sustainable Business Execution Steering Group. It is composed of our Commercial Strategy & Corporate Affairs executive vice president and other senior sustainability leaders, including representatives of North America and International Operations. Supported by the underlying steering groups, the Sustainable Business Execution Steering Group provides guidance on implementation related to our social and environmental initiatives.\n\nTo ensure a well-rounded governance setup, we actively seek external input through our Sustainability Advisory Council. Comprised of experts from various fields, this independent body offers invaluable perspectives that challenge us to continuously improve our sustainability efforts. They provide constructive feedback on our current initiatives and help us explore innovative opportunities for the future.

        "page_content": "## EU Taxonomy\n\nThe EU Taxonomy is a European sustainability classification framework. It enables corporates to communicate to stakeholders which of their business activities have the potential to be considered sustainable (i.e. are Taxonomyeligible) and report to which extent eligible activities fulfil EU requirements to be considered sustainable (i.e. are Taxonomy-aligned). For each relevant business activity, the company has to disclose how much of its Turnover, Operating Expenditures (OpEx) and Capital Expenditures (CapEx) can be considered eligible and aligned, respectively.\n\nIn 2023 we identified eligible economic activities based on the six published environmental objectives . Each of the economic activities was assessed on its percentage of Taxonomy-eligibility and, for those related to the environmental objectives of 'Climate change mitigation' and 'Climate change adaptation', also on their percentage of Taxonomy-alignment. As a result, we report 100%, 60% and 5% Taxonomy-eligible Turnover, CapEx and OpEx in 2023, respectively.\n\n## Eligibility and alignment\n\nWe followed a two-step process to arrive at our Taxonomy disclosures. Firstly, we screened the economic activities defined in the EU Taxonomy to identify those relevant under the Novo Nordisk business model. Based on our review and materiality considerations, we identified one new economic activity to report on in 2023: '1.2 Manufacture of medicinal products' under the environmental objective of 'Pollution prevention and control'. Furthermore, like in 2022, we report Taxonomy-eligible CapEx for the economic activities '7.1 Construction of new buildings' and '7.2 Renovation of existing buildings' under the environmental objective 'Climate change mitigation'.\n\nSecondly, we evaluated whether we could classify any of our Taxonomy-eligible CapEx for economic activity 7.1 and 7.2 as Taxonomy-aligned. Although we have made progress in fulfilling the technical screening criteria, certain requirements in the design phase of the projects have not been fully met. Consequently, the existing projects do not meet the criteria for alignment in 2023. We strive for alignment of certain projects in 2024. Furthermore, we have started investigating the requirements, including CapEx plans, for reporting alignment of the activity 'Manufacture of medicinal products' with the aspiration of reporting alignment for part of the activities in 2024.\n\n| EU TAXONOMY ELIGIBILITY AND ALIGNMENT               | 1                                                                         | Turnover   | Turnover           | Turnover          | Turnover   | CapEx                  | CapEx   | CapEx            | CapEx    | OpEx                   | OpEx   | OpEx             | OpEx     |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|--------------------|-------------------|------------|------------------------|---------|------------------|----------|------------------------|--------|------------------|----------|\n|                                                     |                                                                           | 2022       | 2022               | 2023              | 2023       | 2022                   | 2022    | 2023             | 2023     | 2022                   | 2022   | 2023             | 2023     |\n|                                                     |                                                                           | (DKK       |                    | (DKK              |            | (DKK                   |         | (DKK             |          | (DKK                   |        | (DKK             |          |\n| Environmental objective Total Turnover, CapEx, OpEx | Economic activity 2                                                       | million)   | (%)  176,954  100% | million)  232,261 | (%) 100%   | million)  23,961  100% | (%)     | million)  44,498 | (%) 100% | million)  23,348  100% | (%)    | million)  31,115 | (%) 100% |\n| Taxonomy-non-eligible activities (B.)               |                                                                           | N/A        |                    | 0                 | 0%         | 20,788                 | 87%     | 17,996           | 40%      | 23,348  100%           |        | 29,646           | 95%      |\n|                                                     |                                                                           |            | N/A                | 0                 | 0%         | 1,166                  | 5%      | 6,010            | 14%      | 0                      | 0%     | 0                | 0%       |\n| Climate change mitigation                           | 7.1.

None of the reported economic activities are Enabling or Transitional and we do not have any economic activities substantially contributing to 'Climate Change Adaption', 'Water', 'Circular Economy' or 'Biodiversity'.  3. When allocating CapEx and OpEx to economic activities, we prioritise those that directly contribute to an environmental objective and for which specific technical screening criteria are set. Secondly, we link CapEx and OpEx associated with our primary economic activity, '1.2. Manufacture of medicinal products'.\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nTotal Turnover consists of total revenue from sale of goods, as defined under IFRS. The Turnover KPI is defined as Taxonomy-eligible Turnover divided by total Turnover.\n\nTotal CapEx consists of additions to fixed assets (including financial lease) and intangible assets. Additions resulting from business combinations are also included. Goodwill is not included in CapEx as it is not defined as an intangible asset in accordance with IAS 38. The CapEx KPI is defined as Taxonomy-eligible CapEx divided by total CapEx.\n\nTotal OpEx consists of direct non-capitalised costs that relate to research and development, building renovation, short-term lease, maintenance and repair and any other direct expenditures relating to the day-to-day servicing of property, plant and equipment assets. OpEx excludes amortisations and impairments. The OpEx KPI is defined as Taxonomyeligible OpEx divided by total OpEx.\n\nNone of our activities contribute to multiple objectives and hence do not require disaggregation of KPI's. For the CapEx and OpEx allocations, we have identified the relevant purchases and measures as well as the primary related economic activity. Thereby, we ensure that no CapEx or OpEx is double counted. We are adjusting the R&D cost for amortisations to not double count these costs, as the amortisation would also have been part of CapEx in prior years.\n\n## Contextual information about the KPIs\n\nWe consider all Novo Nordisk's revenue related to Manufacture of medicinal products. As Taxonomy-eligible, we only include CapEx directly associated with the manufacturing process or related to construction or renovation of buildings, hence intangible assets are excluded. This is the main reason for reported eligibility being less than 100%. Eligible CapEx mainly relates to the expansion of production capacity and consist of additions to property, plant and equipment, cf. note 3.2 to the Consolidated financial statements. Eligible OpEx mainly relates to research and development directly linked to manufacturing processes. The narrow EU Taxonomy OpEx definition is the main reason for a reported low eligibility.",

Diseases like diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular disease and rare blood disorders pose significant threats to human health and society, demanding urgent action.\n\nGuided by our purpose to drive change to defeat serious chronic diseases, we are broadening our pipeline of potential new treatments with an approach that is as comprehensive as it is innovative. Building on our 100-year heritage in protein and peptide engineering, we are harnessing the power of novel research technology platforms, leveraging cutting-edge data science tools and forging new strategic partnerships. This multi-faceted approach is enabling us to accelerate our research efforts and expand our footprint across multiple disease areas.\n\nAs our evolution from a diabetes-focused organisation to a broader cardiometabolic-focused company continues, our attention remains on areas with the highest unmet needs - and those where we are best positioned to compete. Strengthening our leadership position in both diabetes and obesity remains our top priority, while expanding our presence in cardiovascular disease and rare blood disorders is also a key focus.\n\nWe are stepping up our investment in these areas to build and maintain industry-leading pipelines, while at the same time seeking new opportunities to complement our in-house expertise with external innovation. Over the past year, this\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nemphasis on business development has resulted in the acquisition of biotechs including Inversago Pharma and Embark, two companies developing novel therapies with a potential application across a range of cardiometabolic diseases.\n\nTo further expand our capabilities, we have established a significant presence in the Greater Boston area, a worldrenowned hub for innovation and cutting-edge science and technology. Through strategic partnerships, such as those with technology firm Valo Health and the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, we aim to accelerate our drug discovery and development efforts, expanding our use of human data, artificial intelligence and machine learning and tapping into our partners' innovative genetics and genomics tools.\n\nThese extensive, wide-ranging efforts are already yielding positive results, including the initiation of clinical testing for cutting-edge cell therapy and siRNA (small interfering ribonucleic acid) treatments. Armed with an increasing array of novel research and development tools, we aim to move a greater number of projects into clinical testing at a faster pace, reducing the cost per project without compromising safety or quality.\n\n## STRATEGIC ASPIRATIONS 2025\n\n- 1.  Further raise the innovation-bar for diabetes treatment\n- 2.  Develop a leading portfolio of superior treatment solutions for obesity\n- 3.  Strengthen and progress the Rare Disease pipeline\n- 4.  Establish presence in Cardiovascular & Emerging Therapy Areas focusing on CVD, MASH and CKD",

Our investigational once-weekly insulin icodec represents the latest major step forward in insulin care, potentially changing the basal insulin experience for people living with diabetes.\n\n'If approved, insulin icodec will become the first once-weekly basal insulin option for adults with diabetes, reducing the number of weekly basal insulin injections from seven to just one.'\n\nInsulin icodec has been filed for regulatory approval in the US, EU and China, following phase 3a trials that demonstrated superior reductions in blood glucose levels and reduced incidence of severe hypoglycaemia compared to once-daily basal insulin degludec and insulin glargine U100 in insulin-na\u00efve people with type 2 diabetes. If approved, insulin icodec will become the first once-weekly basal insulin option for adults with diabetes, reducing the number of weekly injections from seven to just one.\n\nIn the longer term, we are working on further improvements in insulin technology. This includes continuing to pursue the development of glucose-sensitive insulin, which only becomes active when the body's glucose levels start to rise.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Taking diabetes treatment to the next level with CagriSema\n\nOur determination to raise the bar in diabetes treatment is exemplified by CagriSema, our new investigational therapy for type 2 diabetes that has now entered large-scale phase 3 clinical development. This two-in-one medicine combines semaglutide with the amylin analogue cagrilintide, offering a novel mechanism to influence the gut-brain axis with the aim of improving glycaemic control in people living with type 2 diabetes. Cagrilintide works by reducing hunger and increasing satiety signals to the brain, providing an additive effect to semaglutide.\n\nThe decision to move into phase 3 development follows phase 2 results that showed a once-weekly subcutaneous injection of CagriSema reduced long-term blood glucose levels by 2.2 percentage points and outperformed its individual components in reducing body weight. CagriSema, which appears to have a safe and well-tolerated profile, previously commenced large-scale phase 3 trials in obesity in 2022, reflecting its broad potential across multiple therapy areas.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The findings demonstrated a 20% reduction in major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) for trial participants treated with semaglutide 2.4 mg compared to placebo - showing that semaglutide not only helps patients lose weight but can also improve cardiovascular outcomes.\n\nThe trial data showed this effect is consistent regardless of patient age, gender, ethnicity and starting BMI (body mass index), with risk reductions evident across heart attack, cardiovascular death and stroke. Importantly, the effect is seen soon after treatment initiation, suggesting that weight loss alone may not fully explain the benefits of semaglutide 2.4 mg in reducing the risk of MACE.\n\nEvery year almost 21 million people die from CVD, which is the leading cause of disability and death worldwide. While cardiovascular mortality has decreased over the past two\n\ndecades, obesity-related cardiovascular deaths have increased significantly. Obesity leads to cardiovascular morbidity and mortality and is associated with risk factors such as high blood pressure and inflammation.\n\n'It is the first time that an approved weight management medicine has been shown to reduce the risk of heart attacks, strokes and cardiovascular death.'\n\nIt is the first time that an approved weight management medicine has been shown to reduce the risk of heart attacks, strokes and cardiovascular death. Novo Nordisk has filed for a label update of Wegovy \u00ae in the US and EU based on these findings, and a decision is expected in 2024. The US Food and Drug Administration has granted our submission a priority review.",

Affecting an estimated 620 million people across the globe, it takes a major toll on quality of life and is currently the leading cause of death worldwide.\n\nAt Novo Nordisk, we are determined to reduce the risk and burden of living with CVD, and over the past year we have taken significant steps to increase our footprint in this area of huge unmet need.\n\nIn October 2023, we strengthened our CVD pipeline with the acquisition of ocedurenone in a deal worth up to USD 1.3 billion. This mature clinical candidate targets uncontrolled hypertension - a leading risk factor for cardiovascular events, heart failure, chronic kidney disease (CKD) and premature death.\n\nTo date, ocedurenone has been investigated in nine clinical trials, and is currently in phase 3 development for the treatment of uncontrolled hypertension in people with CKD. We expect to initiate further phase 3 trials in the coming years as we seek to maximise its full potential.\n\nMeanwhile, our first standalone CVD compound, ziltivekimab, is currently in phase 3 development for the treatment of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease in people living with CKD. The ZEUS trial will include more than 6,000 patients in 38 countries, with completion expected in late-2025.\n\n## Next-generation treatments for rare blood disorders\n\nOur Rare Disease unit - comprising treatments for rare blood and endocrine disorders - has a growing pipeline of exciting products, including two potential medicines for rare blood disorders with large unmet medical needs.\n\nMim8, our next-generation bispecific antibody for haemophilia A, is now in phase 3 development. Administered subcutaneously, it works by mimicking the function of the missing clotting factor VIII and is being tested as a treatment to prevent bleeds.\n\nThe experimental once-daily oral medicine etavopivat, also in phase 3 evaluation, offers potential benefits for people with sickle cell disease (SCD), a crippling and life-threatening condition caused by misshapen red blood cells. Acquired as part of the business development deal that brought US-based Forma Therapeutics in-house in 2022, the investigational therapy is designed to modulate red blood cell health to reduce anaemia, pain, transfusions and strokes in people living with SCD.\n\n<!-- image -->",

This has resulted in a record number of people being treated with our medicines, but also supply constraints. In response, we are significantly ramping up production capacity and have introduced clear prioritisation principles to ensure broad and equitable distribution of our products.\n\nOur centenary year has been characterised by extraordinary growth, driven by surging global demand for our medicines. Faced with these unprecedented circumstances, we have reshaped our commercial execution strategy to best serve the record number of patients who rely on our medicines. By ensuring supply for patients in the greatest need while continuing to bring innovation to people living with serious chronic diseases all over the world, we aim to balance our financial and societal responsibilities.\n\nFinding parity between the value we create and the values we aspire to has required some radical changes to normal commercial practices, along with a different mindset among sales staff. In many ways, we have rewritten the traditional rulebook for product launches by placing greater focus on the equitable distribution of limited supplies between different geographies and patient groups.\n\nOur top priority is that patients currently on Novo Nordisk medicines continue to have uninterrupted access to an appropriate treatment option. We are also focusing on introducing new treatments to new markets in a more measured way, aligned\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nwith our unwavering commitment to deliver innovation to as many patients across the globe as possible.\n\nAt the same time, we are investing heavily in new and upgraded production facilities in Denmark and other countries, increasing our capacity to meet current and future demand for our treatments and laying the foundation for sustainable long-term growth.\n\nThese investments include a record DKK 42 billion expansion of our flagship production site in Kalundborg, Denmark, which is already producing half of the world's entire supply of insulin. Outside of Denmark, we are more than doubling the production footprint of our long-established facilities in Chartres, France, with investments totalling DKK 17 billion. Both projects will include state-of-the-art, multi-product facilities to accommodate current and future products and processes.\n\nWith construction under way on these major expansion projects, we strive to operate our facilities across the globe 24/7. In the past year, we have delivered more products to more patients than ever before, but such is the scale of demand that we expect periodic supply constraints to continue into 2024.\n\n## STRATEGIC ASPIRATIONS 2025\n\n- 1.  Strengthen diabetes leadership - aim at global value market\n- share of more than 1/3\n- 2.  More than DKK 25 billion in Obesity sales by 2025\n- 3.  Secure a sustained growth outlook for Rare Disease",

Available as a once-weekly injection, it is contributing to a major shift in treatment for type 2 diabetes. At the same time, our oral GLP-1-based therapy, Rybelsus \u00ae , is gaining ground by offering patients with type 2 diabetes an intervention without injections. Demand for these two products has grown to unprecedented levels, helping to generate record sales growth despite supply constraints and a decline in demand for the first-generation GLP-1-based product Victoza \u00ae .\n\nAlthough competition is increasing, Novo Nordisk remains the market leader in the GLP-1 market with a value share of 54.8%, broadly steady compared to 2022 where our value share stood at 54.9%.\n\nThe high demand for our GLP-1-based medicines is partly fuelled by a growing understanding of the importance of the class among healthcare professionals, patients and payers.\n\nThis includes a recognition that certain GLP-1-based therapies are not only highly effective options for controlling blood sugar levels, but may also offer significant benefits in terms of reducing weight and cardiovascular risks - positive effects now reflected in international treatment guidelines.\n\nDespite declining sales of insulin in key markets, reflecting both pricing pressures and lower volumes in some geographies, Novo Nordisk's insulin value market share remains little changed from 12 months earlier, at 43.9%, compared to 44.6% in 2022.\n\nAcross International Operations, insulin is still an important and growing segment, although insulin sales in China have been adversely impacted since the introduction of Volume Based Procurement in mid-2022. The US has also experienced a decline in overall volumes and a decrease in realised prices due to channel / payer mix and higher rebates.\n\nNevertheless, in a global diabetes market driven by high GLP-1 growth, we are uniquely positioned to maintain and strengthen our leadership in this sector and have already met our target of securing value market share of at least one-third by 2025.",

UK physicians are being urged to prescribe responsibly and Novo Nordisk is also reserving a share of Wegovy \u00ae supply in each new launch market for patients who cannot afford to pay for the product out of pocket.\n\nThe success of Wegovy \u00ae , which builds on our experience with our first-generation GLP-1-based obesity product Saxenda \u00ae , means that Novo Nordisk has captured most of the growth and gained a clear leadership position in the obesity market. The sector remains extremely dynamic, with new players lining up to enter the space amid a growing appreciation that medicines tackling obesity have the potential to boost public health and cut long-term healthcare costs.\n\nGlobally, the number of people living with obesity has almost tripled since 1975 and is set to reach over 1.2 billion adults by 2030. The causes of obesity are complex and its consequences far-reaching because, so often, it puts people on a path to other diseases - not only diabetes, but also heart and liver diseases, cancers and many more.\n\nToday, only one in 10 people living with obesity seek professional medical help - and only one in five of those receive treatment with a weight management medication. But attitudes are changing fast. The past two years have been characterised by a growing understanding among both the medical community and the public of the critical need to treat obesity, while an increasing number of people living with the disease are actively seeking support. We want to understand more about their journey and how we can continue to help them maintain their long-term progress towards better health.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## OBESITY SALES (DKK billion)\n\nSales as reported\n\nGrowth at CER\n\n<!-- image -->",

Sales of rare blood disorder products, meanwhile, were up 1% as a decline in NovoSeven \u00ae and NovoEight \u00ae sales was offset by growing demand for our newer haemophilia A and B therapies, Esperoct \u00ae and Refixia \u00ae .\n\nDespite the challenges encountered this year, we remain confident that our rich pipeline in rare disease can bring growth back on track. The line-up of new therapies includes significant advances in both rare blood and endocrine disorders. Next-generation treatments including Mim8 and Alhemo \u00ae in haemophilia will add to growth in the medium term, while accelerated internal innovation and external business development will help us to build our presence in other rare disease areas of high unmet need, such as sickle cell disease.\n\nIn the rare endocrine space, our once-weekly treatment Sogroya \u00ae offers a new opportunity for people living with growth hormone deficiency by removing the burden of daily injections and offering demonstrated efficacy.\n\n## RARE DISEASE SALES (DKK billion)\n\nSales as reported Growth at CER\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2020\n\n2021\n\n2023\n\n2022\n\nTackling the supply problems that prevent us from meeting the growing demand for our products is a top priority for Novo Nordisk. We know we must do more to ramp up capacity, and our colleagues in production are working around the clock to get additional supplies onto pharmacy shelves and into the hands of patients.\n\nIn the past year we have announced investments totalling more than DKK 75 billion into expanding capacity across our global network of production sites - including major expansions of our facilities in Kalundborg, Denmark, and Chartres, France, and the acquisition of a brownfield development and production site in Athlone, Ireland. There are, however, limits to how rapidly we can translate these investments into making more medicines that are ready for shipment. Pharmaceutical production must adhere to the highest possible standards, and we will never compromise on safety and quality for the sake of speed. In the meantime, we strive to operate our global manufacturing facilities 24/7 to maximise output from the current production base.\n\nWe are also thinking strategically about ways to remove bottlenecks in the supply chain. For example, we are seeking to alleviate pressure on device supplies by introducing our medicines in once-weekly rather than daily formulations, and we are exploring ways to reduce the reliance on single-use injection devices.\n\n## CAPEX INVESTMENTS (DKK billion)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

The sales decline was mainly driven by North America Operations.\n\n## Insulin sales\n\nSales of insulin decreased by 9% measured in Danish kroner and by 6% at CER to DKK 48,022 million. Sales decline at CER was driven by declining sales in the US and Region China.\n\n## Obesity care\n\nSales of Obesity care products, Wegovy \u00ae and Saxenda \u00ae , increased by 147% measured in Danish kroner and by 154% at CER to DKK 41,632 million.

The increase in gross margin reflects a positive product mix, driven by increased sales of GLP-1-based treatments. This is partially countered by costs related to ongoing capacity expansions, a negative currency impact and lower realised prices mainly in the US and Region China.\n\nSales and distribution costs increased by 23% measured in Danish kroner and by 26% at CER to DKK 56,743 million. The increase in costs is driven by both North America Operations and International Operations. In North America Operations, the cost increase is driven by the relaunch of Wegovy \u00ae and promotional activities for Ozempic \u00ae . In International Operations, the increase is mainly related to promotional activities for\n\nRybelsus \u00ae as well as Obesity care market development activities. The increase in sales and distribution costs is impacted by adjustments to legal provisions.\n\nResearch and development costs increased by 35% measured in Danish kroner and by 37% at CER to DKK 32,443 million reflecting increased late-stage clinical trial activity and increased early research activities compared to 2022.

The foreign exchange result was a gain of DKK 1,652 million compared with a net loss of DKK 4,651 million in 2022.\n\nAs per the end of December 2023, a positive market value of financial contracts of approximately DKK 1.6 billion has been deferred for recognition in 2024.\n\nThe effective tax rate was 20.1% in 2023 compared with an effective tax rate of 19.6% in 2022.\n\nNet profit increased by 51% to DKK 83,683 million and diluted earnings per share increased by 52% to DKK 18.62.\n\n## Cash flow and capital allocation\n\nFree cash flow realised in 2023 was DKK 68.3 billion compared with DKK 57.4 billion in 2022 supporting the strategic aspiration to deliver attractive capital allocation to shareholders. The cash conversion in 2023 is positively impacted by timing of payment of rebates in the US, including provisions related to the revised 340B distribution policy in the US. Income under the 340B Program has been partially recognised.\n\nCapital expenditure for property, plant and equipment was DKK 25.8 billion compared with DKK 12.1 billion in 2022, primarily reflecting investments in additional capacity for active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) production and fill-finish capacity for both current and future injectable and oral products. Capital expenditures for intangible assets was DKK 13.1 billion in 2023 compared with DKK 2.6 billion in 2022 reflecting business development activities.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1. Expectations for 2024.\n\n## 2024 outlook\n\nSales growth is expected to be 18% to 26% at CER. Given the current exchange rates versus the Danish krone, sales growth reported in DKK is expected to be around 1 percentage point lower than at CER. The guidance reflects expectations for sales growth in both North America Operations and International Operations, mainly driven by volume growth of GLP-1-based treatments for Obesity and Diabetes care. Intensifying competition and continued pricing pressure within Diabetes and Obesity Care are included in the guidance.\n\nFollowing higher than expected volume growth in recent years, including GLP-1-based products such as Ozempic \u00ae and Wegovy \u00ae , combined with the expectation of continued volume growth and capacity limitations at some manufacturing sites, the outlook also reflects expected continued periodic supply constraints and related drug shortage notifications across a number of products and geographies. Novo Nordisk is investing in internal and external capacity to increase supply both short and long term. Novo Nordisk started gradually increasing the supply of the lower dose strengths of Wegovy \u00ae in the US in January 2024. A gradual roll-out of Wegovy \u00ae with capped volumes in International Operations is included in the guidance.\n\nOperating profit growth is expected to be 21% to 29% at CER. Given the current exchange rates versus the Danish krone, growth reported in DKK is now expected to be around 2 percentage points lower than at CER. The expectation for operating profit growth primarily reflects the sales growth outlook and continued investments in future and current growth drivers within Research, Development and Commercial. Within R&D, investments are related to the continued expansion and progression of the early and late-stage pipeline. Commercial investments are mainly related to Obesity care market development activities as well as increased spend related to GLP-1 diabetes care.\n\nNovo Nordisk now expects financial items (net) to amount to a gain of around DKK 1.3 billion, mainly reflecting gains associated with foreign exchange hedging contracts as well as interest gains from cash and marketable securities.\n\nThe effective tax rate for 2024 is expected to be in the range of 19-21%.\n\nCapital expenditure is expected to be around DKK 45 billion in 2024 reflecting the expansion of the supply chain, including the previously communicated expansions of the manufacturing facilities in Kalundborg and Hiller\u00f8d, Denmark, and Chartres, France. The investments in Kalundborg will create additional capacity across the entire global value chain from manufacturing of active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) to packaging, with the majority invested in API capacity. The API facility will be designed as a multi-product facility with flexibility to accommodate current and future processes. In Hiller\u00f8d, the investments will create additional production capacity of API within Cardiovascular & Emerging Therapy Areas. The expansion of the production facilities in Chartres are related to additional aseptic production and finished production processes. In the coming years, the capital expenditure to sales ratio is still expected to be low double digit.\n\nDepreciation, amortisation and impairment losses are expected to be around DKK 10 billion.",

Novo Nordisk's capital structure strategy offers a balance between long-term shareholder value creation and competitive shareholder return in the short term.\n\nIn 2021, the capital structure was adjusted following Novo Nordisk's Eurobond issuance with an aggregate principal amount of EUR 1.3 billion. In 2022, Novo Nordisk issued Eurobonds in the amount of EUR 1.5 billion. The total outstanding Eurobonds in 2023 amounted to EUR 2.8 billion.\n\n## Dividend policy\n\nThe company's dividend policy applies a pharmaceutical industry benchmark to ensure a competitive payout ratio for dividend payments, which are complemented by share repurchase programmes. The final dividend for 2022 paid in March 2023 was equal to DKK 4.08 per A and B share of DKK 0.10 as well as for ADRs. The total dividend for 2022 was DKK 6.20 per A and B share of DKK 0.10, corresponding to a payout ratio of 50.3%. The 2022 pharma peer group average was 46.5%.\n\nIn August 2023, an interim dividend was paid equaling DKK 3.00 per A and B share of DKK 0.10 as well as for ADRs. For 2023, the Board of Directors will propose a final dividend of DKK 6.40 to be paid in March 2024, equivalent to a total dividend for 2023 of DKK 9.40 and a payout ratio of 50.19%. The company expects to distribute an interim dividend in August 2024. Further information regarding this interim dividend will be announced in connection with the financial report for the first six months of 2024. Dividends are paid from distributable reserves. Novo Nordisk does not pay a dividend on its holding of treasury shares.\n\n## Share repurchase programme for 2023/2024\n\nDuring the twelve-month period beginning 1 February 2023, Novo Nordisk repurchased shares worth DKK 30 billion. The share repurchase programme has primarily been conducted in accordance with the safe harbour rules in the EU Market Abuse Regulation (MAR) 4 .\n\nFor the next 12 months, Novo Nordisk has decided to implement a new share repurchase programme. The expected total repurchase value of B shares, for the 12 months beginning 2024, amounts to a cash value of up to DKK 20 billion. The total programme may be reduced in size if significant business development opportunities arise during 2024. Novo Nordisk expects to conduct the majority of the new share repurchase programme according to the safe harbour rules in MAR. At the Annual General Meeting in March 2024, the Board of Directors will propose a further reduction in the company's B share capital, corresponding to approximately 1.0% of the total share capital, by cancelling 45 million treasury shares.\n\n## Share price development\n\nThe Novo Nordisk price of the B share of a nominal value of DKK 0.20 was end of December 2022 DKK 938.00. Following the two-for-one stock split in September 2023, the B share price of a nominal value of DKK 0.10 was end of December 2023 DKK 698.10. The comparable share prices for B shares with a nominal value of DKK 0.10 were DKK 469.00 and DKK 698.10 at the end of 2022 and 2023 respectively, an increase of 48.8 %. The total market value of Novo Nordisk's B shares, excluding treasury shares and Novo Holdings A/S shares, was DKK 2,229,925,434,103, as of 29 December 2023.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n5.

        "page_content": "## Risk management\n\nTo be a sustainable business, we must remain responsive to evolving expectations and seize strategic opportunities as they arise. Managing risks rigorously and systematically is crucial to our ability to create and protect value.\n\nWe apply a dual-lensed approach to risk management. This means we identify and mitigate both operational risks that pose a threat to our short- to medium-term plans, as well as strategic risks that could reduce our ability to achieve our corporate strategy over the long term.\n\n## Addressing risks in our strategic planning\n\nScenario and risk-thinking exercises are part of our strategic planning. They include analyses of market dynamics, as well as impacts from socioeconomic, environmental, geopolitical and political developments that present risks or opportunities for our business. Annually, Executive Management and the Board of Directors review a strategic risk profile. The main strategic risks are:\n\n## Innovation and competition\n\nNovo Nordisk faces a concentration risk with multiple brands being dependent on the semaglutide compound as the active pharmaceutical ingredient. To remain competitive in the long term and thereby mitigate the innovation risk, we invest in internal and external pipeline opportunities to ensure patients receive improved treatments.\n\n## Production capacity and supply chain risks\n\nDemand fluctuations, resource shortages, geopolitical instability, trade disputes and local manufacturing requirements are all factors that can pressure global supply chains. Furthermore, expanding production capacity is complex and associated with a long lead time. Therefore,\n\nplanning and management of our production capacity and supply chain are key to mitigate this risk.\n\n## Access and affordability\n\nAccess to affordable care is a global issue as healthcare systems struggle to provide quality care at a sustainable cost, while the burden of chronic diseases keeps rising. Ensuring access and affordability is a risk and responsibility Novo Nordisk shares with all involved in healthcare. We recognise that we cannot defeat chronic diseases alone, but to mitigate the risk we can accelerate our actions to find solutions in collaboration with relevant stakeholders.\n\n## Digital disruption\n\nNew digital technologies could bring new competitors into the pharmaceutical industry. They also provide an opportunity for us to deliver more value to our stakeholders and help patients live a life with fewer limitations. Digital health solutions bring new risks, particularly regarding data regulation and privacy, as well as potential quality issues. We strive to monitor and mitigate these risks in close collaboration with relevant partners.\n\n## Environmental impact\n\nNovo Nordisk has an impact on the environment and changes to the climate could potentially have an impact on Novo Nordisk's business. As part of our 'zero environmental impact', we assess, monitor and mitigate these risks throughout our value chain.\n\n## Ethics and compliance\n\nOur commitment to ethics and compliance remains at the forefront of all our operations. Any inability to uphold our ethical standards could lead to reputational implications, with potential effects on market access and\n\npricing negotiations. Our values, encapsulated in the Novo Nordisk Way, guide every decision we make. OneCode, our code of conduct, further empowers us to conduct our operations responsibly. These guidelines help us to maintain integrity, thereby enabling us to fulfil our purpose effectively.\n\n## Operational risk management process\n\nIn the short- to medium-term, we are exposed to risks throughout our value chain. Some risks are inherent in the pharmaceutical industry, such as delays or failures of potential late-stage medicines in the R&D pipeline. Other risks, such as geopolitical instability, supply disruptions and competitive threats, are familiar to any manufacturing company with global production. We will not compromise on product quality, patient safety and business ethics: these are front and centre of our enterprise-wide risk management set-up. We assess risks as potential financial loss or reputational damage likelihood.\n\nExecutive Management, the Board of Directors and the Audit Committee review a risk grid of our biggest operational risks every six months. This grid is based on insights from management teams across the organisation and includes all types of risks that could cause significant disruptions to the business over a three-year horizon, including potential ESG risks. An overview of our key operational risks, along with detailed descriptions, is provided on the next page. For more information, see our Corporate Governance Report available at: www.novonordisk.com/about/corporate-governance.html.\n\n## Company reputation\n\nOn the following page we also include the Novo Nordisk reputation score. This is measured among key stakeholders (i.e. the informed general public, people with diabetes, people with obesity, general practitioners and diabetes specialists) and is an indicator of the extent to which we live up to society's expectations.",

        "page_content": "## Section 1 Notes to the consolidated financial statements\n\n## Basis of preparation\n\n## 1.1 Material accounting policies and key accounting estimates\n\nThe consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report have been prepared in accordance with IFRS Accounting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and in accordance with IFRS Accounting Standards as endorsed by the EU and further requirements in the Danish Financial Statements Act.\n\n## Measurement basis\n\nThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except for derivative financial instruments, equity investments, marketable securities and trade receivables in a factoring portfolio, which are measured at fair value.\n\n## Material accounting policies\n\nApart from the general accounting policies, which are described in note 5.6, Novo Nordisk's accounting policies are described in each of the individual notes to the consolidated financial statements. The accounting policies have been applied consistently in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements for all the years presented.\n\n## Key accounting estimates and judgements\n\nThe use of reasonable estimates and judgements is an essential part of the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. Given the uncertainties inherent in Novo Nordisk's business activities, Management must make certain estimates regarding valuation and make judgements on the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, net sales, expenses and related disclosures.\n\nThe key accounting estimates identified are those that have a significant risk of resulting in a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets and liabilities in the following reporting period. An example being the estimation of US sales deductions and provisions for sales rebates.\n\nWhen determining estimates and assumptions, Management has assessed the qualitative and quantitative impact of climate-related matters. It is Management's assessment that the effect of climate-related matters does not significantly impact estimates and assumptions.\n\nManagement bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are held to be reasonable under the circumstances. The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. If necessary, changes are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised. Management considers the key accounting estimates to be reasonable and appropriate based on currently available information. The actual amounts may differ from the amounts estimated as more detailed information becomes available.\n\nIn addition, Management may make certain judgements in the process of applying the entity's accounting policies, for example the classification of a transaction as an asset acquisition or a business combination.\n\nManagement regards those listed below as the key accounting estimates applied in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. Refer to the specific notes for further information on the key accounting estimates as well as assumptions applied. Management did not identify material judgements made in the current reporting period apart from those involving estimations.\n\n## Applying materiality\n\nThe consolidated financial statements are a result of processing large numbers of transactions and aggregating those transactions into classes according to their nature or function. The transactions are presented in classes of similar items in the consolidated financial statements. If a line item is not individually material, it is aggregated with other items of a similar nature in the consolidated financial statements or in the notes.\n\nManagement provides the specific disclosures required by IFRS unless the information is not applicable or is considered immaterial to the decision-making of the primary users of these financial statements.\n\n## 1.2 Changes in accounting policies and disclosures\n\nManagement has assessed the impact of new or amended accounting standards and interpretations (IFRSs) issued by the IASB and IFRSs endorsed by the European Union effective on or after 1 January 2023. Management assessed that application of these has not had a material impact on the consolidated financial statements for 2023.\n\nFurthermore, Management has assessed the impact of new or amended accounting standards and interpretations (IFRSs) issued by the IASB that have not yet become effective. No new or amended accounting standards or interpretations (IFRSs) have been early adopted. Management does not anticipate any significant impact on the consolidated financial statements in the period of initial application after the adoption of these amendments.\n\n| Key accounting estimates                                                                                      | Risk   | Note(s)   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|-----------|\n| Estimate of US sales deductions and provisions for sales rebates                                              | High   | 2.1, 3.5  |\n| Estimate in determining the fair value of intangible assets and assessment of impairment of intangible assets | Medium | 3.1       |\n| Estimate regarding deferred income tax assets and provision for uncertain tax positions                       | Medium | 2.6       |\n| Estimate of ongoing legal disputes, litigation and investigations                                             | Medium | 3.5       |",

As such, rebates amount to 74% of gross sales in the US (75% in 2022 and 75% in 2021). Provisions for sales rebates include US Managed Care, Medicare, Medicaid, 340B Drug Pricing Program and other US rebate types, as well as rebates in a number of European countries and Canada.\n\n## Pricing mechanisms in the US market\n\nIn the US, sales rebates are paid in connection with public healthcare insurance programmes, including Medicare and Medicaid, as well as rebates to pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) and managed healthcare plans. Key customers in the US include private payers, PBMs and government payers. PBMs and managed healthcare plans play a role in negotiating price concessions with drug manufacturers for both the commercial and government channels, and determine which drugs are covered on their formularies (or 'preferred drug lists').\n\n## US Managed Care and Medicare\n\nFor Managed Care and Medicare, rebates are offered to a number of PBMs and managed healthcare plans. These rebate programmes allow the customer to receive a rebate after attaining certain performance parameters relating to formulary status or pre-established market share thresholds. Rebate provisions are estimated according to the specific terms in each agreement, historical experience, anticipated channel mix, growth rates and market share information. Novo Nordisk adjusts the provision periodically to reflect actual sales performance. Managed Care and Medicare rebates are generally settled around 100 days from the transaction date.\n\n## US wholesaler charge-backs\n\nWholesaler charge-backs relate to contractual arrangements between Novo Nordisk and indirect customers in the US whereby products are sold at contract prices lower than the list price originally charged to wholesalers. Chargeback provisions are estimated using a combination of factors such as historical experience, current wholesaler inventory levels, contract terms and the value of claims received but not yet processed. Wholesaler charge-backs are generally settled within 30 days after receipt of claim.\n\nIn January 2021, Novo Nordisk changed its policy in the US related to the 340B Drug Pricing Program, whereby Novo Nordisk no longer provides 340B statutory discounts to certain pharmacies that contract with covered entities participating in the 340B Drug Pricing Program. Novo Nordisk has recognised revenue related to the 340B Drug Pricing Program to the extent that it is highly probable that its inclusion will not result in a significant revenue reversal in the future. Refer to note 3.5 for a more elaborate description of the ongoing litigation related to the 340B Drug Pricing Program.\n\n## US Medicaid rebates\n\nMedicaid is a government insurance programme. Medicaid rebates have been estimated using a combination of historical experience, product and population growth, price changes and the impact of contracting strategies. The calculation also involves interpretation of relevant regulations that are subject to changes in interpretative guidance from government authorities. Novo Nordisk adjusts the provision periodically to reflect actual sales performance. Medicaid rebates are generally settled around 150 days from the transaction date.\n\n## Other US and non-US discounts and sales returns\n\nOther discounts are provided to distributors, wholesalers, hospitals, pharmacies, etc. They are usually linked to sales volume or provided as cash discounts. Discounts are calculated based on historical data and recorded as a reduction in gross sales at the time the related sales are recorded. Sales returns relate to damaged or expired products.\n\n## Other net sales disclosures\n\nIn 2023, Novo Nordisk had 3 major wholesalers distributing products in the US, representing 22%, 17% and 15% respectively of global net sales (19%, 14% and 13% in 2022 and 18%, 13% and 13% in 2021). Sales to these 3 wholesalers are within both Diabetes and Obesity care and Rare disease.\n\nNet sales to be recognised from fulfilling existing customer contracts containing fixed or minimum sales volumes, with an original term greater than 12 months, are expected to be DKK 3,166 million within 12 months (DKK 1,835 million in 2022) and DKK 443 million thereafter (DKK 798 million in 2022).\n\nNovo Nordisk's sales are impacted by exchange rate changes. Refer to note 4.4 for development in key exchange rates.\n\n## ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\nRevenue from sale of goods is recognised when Novo Nordisk has transferred control of products sold to the buyer and it is probable that Novo Nordisk will collect the consideration to which it is entitled for transferring the products. Control of the products is transferred at a single point in time, typically on delivery. The amount of sales to be recognised is based on the consideration Novo Nordisk expects to receive in exchange for its goods. When sales are recognised, Novo Nordisk also records estimates for a variety of sales deductions; including product returns as well as rebates and discounts to government agencies, wholesalers, health insurance companies, managed healthcare organisations and retail customers. Sales deductions are recognised as a reduction of gross sales to arrive at net sales, by assessing the expected value of the sales deductions (variable consideration). Where contracts contain customer acceptance criteria, Novo Nordisk recognises sales when the acceptance criteria are satisfied.\n\nIn some markets, Novo Nordisk sells products on a sale-or-return basis. Where there is historical experience or a reasonably accurate estimate of future returns, estimated product returns are recorded as a reduction in sales. Where shipments of new products are made on a sale-or-return basis, without sufficient historical experience for estimating sales returns, revenue is recorded based on estimated demand and acceptance rates for well-established products with similar market characteristics. If similar market characteristics do not exist, revenue is recorded when there is evidence of consumption or when the right of return has expired.\n\nUnsettled rebates are recognised as provisions when the timing or amount is uncertain (note 3.5).",

        "page_content": "Where absolute amounts are known, the rebates are recognised as other liabilities. Wholesaler charge-backs that are absolute are netted against trade receivable balances.\n\nThe impact of foreign currency hedging in the income statement is recognised as part of financial items. Refer to notes 4.4, 4.5 and 4.10 for more details on hedging.\n\n## KEY ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES OF SALES DEDUCTIONS AND PROVISIONS FOR SALES REBATES\n\nSales deductions are estimated and provided for at the time the related sales are recorded. These estimates of unsettled rebate, discount and product return obligations is considered a key accounting estimate as not all conditions are known at the time of sale, for example total sales volume to a given customer. The estimates are based on analyses of existing contractual obligations and historical experience. Provisions are calculated on the basis of a percentage of sales for each product as defined by the contracts with the various customer groups. Provisions for sales rebates are adjusted to actual amounts as rebates, discounts and returns are processed.\n\nRevenue related to the 340B Drug Pricing Program can only be recognised to the extent that it is highly probable that a significant reversal of the recognised revenue will not occur. Significant estimation is required to determine the amount of revenue to recognise. Management has considered interpretations of applicable laws, whether the consideration is highly susceptible to factors outside Novo Nordisk's influence, as well as the experience of historical claims. Refer to note 3.5 for information on the ongoing litigation related to the 340B Drug Pricing Program.\n\nNovo Nordisk considers the provisions established for sales rebates to be reasonable and appropriate based on the information currently available. However, the actual amount of rebates and discounts may differ from the amounts estimated by Management as more detailed information becomes available.\n\n## 2.2 Segment information\n\n## Business segments - Key figures\n\n|                                                            | Diabetes and Obesity care   | Diabetes and Obesity care   | Diabetes and Obesity care   | Rare disease   | Rare disease   | Rare disease   | Total    | Total    | Total    |\n|------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|----------|----------|----------|\n| DKK million                                                | 2023                        | 2022                        | 2021                        | 2023           | 2022           | 2021           | 2023     | 2022     | 2021     |\n| Net sales                                                  | 215,098                     | 156,412                     | 121,597                     | 17,163         | 20,542         | 19,203         | 232,261  | 176,954  | 140,800  |\n| Cost of goods sold                                         | (30,483)                    | (23,405)                    | (19,363)                    | (5,282)        | (5,043)        | (4,295)        | (35,765) | (28,448) | (23,658) |\n| Sales and distribution costs                               | (52,477)                    | (42,392)                    | (33,791)                    | (4,266)        | (3,825)        | (3,217)        | (56,743) | (46,217) | (37,008) |\n| Research and development costs                             | (28,073)                    | (20,157)                    | (15,600)                    | (4,370)        | (3,890)        | (2,172)        | (32,443) | (24,047) | (17,772) |\n| Administrative costs                                       | (4,435)                     | (3,955)                     | (3,504)                     | (420)          | (512)          | (546)          | (4,855)  | (4,467)  | (4,050)  |\n| Other operating income and expenses                        | (7)                         | 892                         | 199                         | 126            | 142            | 133            | 119      | 1,034    | 332      |\n| Segment operating profit                                   | 99,623                      | 67,395                      | 49,538                      | 2,951          | 7,414          | 9,106          | 102,574  | 74,809   | 58,644   |\n| Operating margin                                           | 46.3%                       | 43.1%                       | 40.7%                       | 17.2%          | 36.1%          | 47.4%          | 44.2%    | 42.3%    | 41.7%    |\n| Depreciation, amortisation and impairment  losses expensed | (8,195)                     | (5,701)                     | (4,895)                     | (1,218)        | (1,661)        | (1,130)        | (9,413)  | (7,362)  | (6,025)  |\n\n## Business segments\n\nNovo Nordisk operates in two business segments based on therapies: Diabetes and Obesity care and Rare disease, representing the entirety of the Group's operations. The activities of the segments include research, development, manufacturing and marketing of products within the following areas:\n\n- \u00b7 Diabetes and Obesity care: diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular and emerging therapy areas\n- \u00b7 Rare disease: rare blood disorders, rare endocrine disorders and hormone replacement therapy.\n\nSegment performance is evaluated on the basis of operating profit, consistent with the consolidated financial statements. Financial income and expenses and income taxes are managed at Group level and are not allocated to business segments. There are no sales or other transactions between the business segments. Costs have generally been split between business segments according to a specific allocation. Certain corporate overhead costs are allocated between segments based on overall allocation keys. Other operating income and expenses have been allocated to the two segments based on the same principle.\n\n## ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\nOperating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to Executive Management and the Board of Directors. We consider Executive Management to be the operating decision-making body.\n\n## Geographical areas\n\nIn 2023, Novo Nordisk operated in two main commercial units:\n\n- \u00b7 International Operations\n- \u00b7 EMEA: Europe, the Middle East and Africa.\n- \u00b7 China: Mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan.\n- \u00b7 Rest of World: All other countries except for North America.\n- \u00b7 North America Operations (the US and Canada).\n\nIn 2023, the US contributed 10% or more of total net sales. In 2022, the US also contributed 10% or more of total net sales. The country of domicile is Denmark, which is part of EMEA. Denmark is immaterial to Novo Nordisk's activities in terms of sales as 99.2% of total net sales are realised outside Denmark (99.8 % in 2022). Sales are attributed to geographical areas according to the location of the customer.\n\nOut of total property, plant and equipment and intangible assets of DKK 151,367 million (DKK 117,610 million in 2022), DKK 82,274 million is located in Denmark (DKK 54,492 million in 2022) and DKK 46,609 million is located in the US (DKK 44,267 million in 2022) where the majority of production facilities and intangible assets are located.

These methods have played a key role in the development of the production technology used to manufacture insulin, GLP-1, recombinant blood-clotting factors and human growth hormone. Research activities further utilise new technology platforms including stem cells, gene therapy, small molecules and RNAi therapies.\n\nResearch and development activities are mainly carried out by Novo Nordisk's research and development centres, in Denmark, the US, the UK and China. Clinical trials are carried out all over the world. Novo Nordisk also enters into partnerships and licence agreements.\n\nOther research and development costs mainly comprise external consulting fees, IT services, facilities, consumables and other internal costs.\n\n## ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\nNovo Nordisk expenses all research costs. Due to significant regulatory uncertainties and other uncertainties inherent in the development of new products, internal and subcontracted development costs are also expensed as they are incurred, in line with industry practice. This means that they do not qualify for capitalisation as intangible assets until marketing approval by a regulatory authority is obtained or considered highly probable. Costs for post-approval activities that are required by authorities as a condition for obtaining regulatory approval are recognised as research and development costs.\n\nResearch and development costs primarily comprise employee costs as well as internal and external costs related to execution of studies, including manufacturing costs and facility costs of the research centres. The costs also comprise amortisation, depreciation and impairment losses related to intellectual property rights and property, plant and equipment used in the research and development activities.\n\nAmortisations of intellectual property rights related to marketed products are recognised in cost of goods sold. Royalty expenses paid to partners after regulatory approval are also expensed as cost of goods sold.\n\nContractual research and development obligations to be paid in the future are disclosed separately as commitments in note 5.2.\n\n## 2.4 Employee costs\n\n| DKK million                                                                        | 2023    | 2022    | 2021    |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|---------|\n| Wages and salaries                                                                 | 42,867  | 34,575  | 28,939  |\n| Share-based payment costs (note 5.1)                                               | 2,149   | 1,539   | 1,040   |\n| Pensions - defined contribution plans                                              | 3,267   | 2,472   | 2,022   |\n| Pensions - defined benefit plans                                                   | 126     | 185     | 139     |\n| Other social security contributions                                                | 3,039   | 2,713   | 2,203   |\n| Other employee costs                                                               | 4,066   | 3,105   | 2,189   |\n| Total employee costs for the year                                                  | 55,514  | 44,589  | 36,532  |\n| Employee costs capitalised as intangible  assets and property, plant and equipment | (2,337) | (1,451) | (1,240) |\n| Change in employee costs capitalised  as inventories                               | (409)   | (70)    | (56)    |\n| Total employee costs in the income statement                                       | 52,768  | 43,068  | 35,236  |\n| Included in the income statement:                                                  |         |         |         |\n| Cost of goods sold                                                                 | 15,490  | 11,766  | 9,611   |\n| Sales and distribution costs                                                       | 20,810  | 17,700  | 15,003  |\n| Research and development costs                                                     | 12,429  | 9,952   | 7,328   |\n| Administrative costs                                                               | 3,962   | 3,517   | 3,098   |\n| Other operating income and expenses                                                | 77      | 133     | 196     |\n| Total employee costs in the income statement                                       | 52,768  | 43,068  | 35,236  |\n\n## Number of employees\n\n| Number                                 | 2023   | 2022   | 2021   |\n|----------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Average number of full-time employees  | 59,552 | 51,046 | 46,171 |\n| Year-end number of full-time employees | 63,370 | 54,393 | 47,792 |\n| Year-end employees (total)             | 64,319 | 55,185 | 48,478 |",

Other adjustments consist of tax related to acquisitions and adjustments to prior years.\n\nFrom 1 January 2024 Novo Nordisk will be subject to Global Minimum Tax (OECD BEPS Pillar 2 rules). The rules are not expected to have a material impact on the tax position of Novo Nordisk in 2024.\n\n## ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\nThe tax expense for the period comprises current and deferred tax. It also includes adjustments to previous years and changes in provisions for uncertain tax positions. Tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in equity or other comprehensive income. Provisions for ongoing tax disputes are included as part of deferred tax assets, tax receivables and tax payables.\n\nDeferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the accounting and tax values of the individual consolidated companies and from realisable tax loss carry-forwards. Deferred tax liabilities are not recognised if they arise from the initial recognition of goodwill. Deferred income tax is also not accounted for if it arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that, at the time of the transaction, affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss and does not give rise to equal taxable and deductible temporary differences. The tax value of tax loss carry-forwards is included in deferred tax assets to the extent that these are expected to be utilised in future taxable income. The deferred income taxes are measured according to current tax rules and at the tax rates assumed in the year in which the assets are expected to be utilised.\n\nIn general, the Danish tax rules related to dividends from group companies provide exemption from tax for most repatriated profits. In some countries withholding tax will be applied to dividends paid to Denmark. A provision for withholding tax is only recognised if a concrete distribution of dividends is planned. The unrecognised potential withholding tax amounts to DKK 1,026 million (DKK 567 million in 2022).\n\nThe value of future tax deductions in relation to share programmes is recognised as a deferred tax asset until the shares are paid out to the employees. Any estimated excess tax deduction compared to the costs realised in the income statement is charged to equity.",

        "page_content": "## KEY ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES REGARDING DEFERRED INCOME TAX ASSETS AND PROVISIONS FOR UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS\n\nManagement has considered future taxable income and has estimated the amount of deferred income tax assets that should be recognised. The estimate is based on an assessment of whether sufficient taxable income will be available in the future, against which the temporary differences and unused tax losses can be utilised. The total tax value of unrecognised tax loss carry-forwards amounts to DKK 360 million in 2023 (DKK 318 million in 2022).\n\nIn the course of conducting business globally, tax and transfer pricing disputes with tax authorities may occur. Management has estimated the expected outcome of the disputes by using the 'most likely outcome' method to determine the provisions for uncertain tax positions. Management considers the provisions made to be adequate. However, the actual obligation may deviate and depends on the result of litigation and settlements with the relevant tax authorities.\n\n## Development in deferred income tax assets and liabilities\n\n| DKK million                                                     | Property, plant and equipment   | Intangible assets   | Inventories   | Liabilities   | Other   | Offset within countries   | Total    |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------|---------------|---------------|---------|---------------------------|----------|\n| 2023                                                            |                                 |                     |               |               |         |                           |          |\n| Net deferred tax asset/(liability) at the beginning of the year | (2,402)                         | (8,279)             | 2,595         | 11,007        | 3,922   | -

        "page_content": "## Description of material additions\n\n## 2023 additions\n\nNovo Nordisk acquired Ocedurenone for uncontrolled hypertension with potential application in cardiovascular and kidney disease from KBP Biosciences PTE., Ltd. Ocedurenone is an orally administered, small molecule, non-steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (nsMRA) that is currently being examined in the phase 3 trial CLARION-CKD in patients with uncontrolled hypertension and advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD). The transaction has been accounted for as an asset acquisition, with DKK 5,650 million recognised in intellectual property rights.\n\nNovo Nordisk acquired Inversago Pharma Inc. and obtained ownership of the development asset INV-202. INV-202, an oral CB1 inverse agonist, is designed to preferentially block the receptor protein CB1, which plays an important role in metabolism and appetite regulation. The transaction has been accounted for as an asset acquisition, with DKK 4,321 million recognised in intellectual property rights.\n\nNovo Nordisk acquired Biocorp Production in a transaction accounted for as an asset acquisition with DKK 1,221 million recognised in intellectual property rights.\n\nOf the total additions of intangible assets, DKK 500 million relates to internally generated software and other intangibles (DKK 544 million in 2022).\n\n## 2022 additions\n\nAdditions from acquisition of businesses relates to Novo Nordisk's acquisition of Forma Therapeutics Holdings, Inc., which primarily includes the lead candidate Etavopivat, which is recognised within intellectual property rights; refer to note 5.3 for details on the business combination.\n\n## Impairment test\n\n## Intangible assets other than goodwill\n\nIn 2023, an impairment loss of DKK 1,796 million (DKK 760 million in 2022) was recognised. The entire DKK 1,796 million (DKK 250 million in 2022) of the impairment was related to the Diabetes and Obesity care segment. DKK 382 million was recognised as a reversal of prior impairment related to Rare disease (DKK 510 million impairment loss in 2022). The entire impairment loss in 2023, including the reversal of prior impairment, was recognised in research and development costs (DKK 760 million in research and development costs in 2022). The impairment was a result of Management's review of expectations related to intellectual property rights not yet in use.\n\nNo impairment related to marketable products was identified in 2023 or in 2022.\n\n## Goodwill\n\nAs of 31 December 2023, goodwill is allocated to the segments Diabetes and Obesity care DKK 4,018 million (DKK 4,154 million in 2022) and Rare Disease DKK 446 million (DKK 461 million in 2022). No impairment of goodwill was recognised in 2023 or 2022 as the annual impairment test showed that the estimated recoverable amount in the forecast period exceeded the carrying amount of the cash-generating units to which goodwill was allocated.\n\nGoodwill is monitored for impairment at the operating segment level, which is the lowest level CGU to which consolidated goodwill is allocated and monitored by Management. CGUs are therefore defined as Novo Nordisk's business segments, Diabetes and Obesity care and Rare disease. The recoverable amount is estimated using an income-approach and is based on discounted cash flow projections. The applied post-tax discount rates for Diabetes and Obesity care and Rare diseases are 7.0% (Pre-tax discount rate of 8.3%). Cash flow projections are based on budgets approved by Management. The forecast period for Diabetes and Obesity care, and Rare diseases is 9 years.\n\nThe discounted cash flow from the budget and forecast period significantly exceeds the carrying amount of goodwill.\n\nThe key assumptions and sensitivities are Novo Nordisk's volume market share, growth rates, pricing, development of new markets and the success rate for introducing new products and treatments. Sensitivities are affected by external factors such as market and generic competition, and price regulation.\n\nThe value assigned to key assumptions reflects past experience adjusted for market specific risks or expected changes. Fair value is determined using largely unobservable inputs.\n\n## Other intangible assets disclosures\n\nIntangible assets with an indefinite useful life and intangible assets not yet available for use amount to DKK 34,012 million (DKK 27,536 million in 2022), primarily intellectual property rights and goodwill. The carrying amount of internally generated intangible assets amounts to DKK 1,277 million at end of 2023 (DKK 1,017 million in 2022).\n\nIntellectual property rights include DKK 5,650 million related to Ocedurenone (acquired in 2023), DKK 5,740 million related to Etavopivat (DKK 5,546 million in 2022), DKK 4,648 million related to Ziltivekimab (DKK 4,648 million in 2022), all of which are intangible assets under development.\n\nIn addition, intellectual property rights contain DKK 6,018 million related to Rybelsus \u00ae (DKK 6,584 million in 2022), which has a remaining useful life of 11 years (12 years in 2022), DKK 4,206 million related to Nedosiran (DKK 3,704 million in 2022) with a remaining useful life of 13 years and DKK 9,480 million (DKK 10,251 million in 2022) related to the RNAi technology platform, with a remaining estimated useful life of 21 years (22 years in 2022).\n\n## ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\n## Research and development projects\n\nInternal and subcontracted research costs are fully charged to the consolidated income statement in the period in which they are incurred. Consistent with industry practice, development costs are also expensed until regulatory approval is obtained or is probable; refer to note 2.3.\n\nPayments to third parties under collaboration and licence agreements are assessed for the substance of their nature. Payments which represent subcontracted research and development work are expensed as the services are received. Payments which represent rights to the transfer of intellectual property, developed at risk by the third party, are capitalised.\n\nFor acquired research and development projects, and intellectual property rights, the likelihood of obtaining future commercial sales is reflected in the cost of the asset, and thus the probability recognition criteria is always considered to be satisfied. As the cost of acquired research and development projects can often be measured reliably, these projects fulfil the capitalisation criteria as intangible assets on acquisition. Subsequent milestone payments payable on achievement of a contingent event (e.g. commencement of phase 3 trials) are accrued and capitalised into the cost of the intangible asset when the achievement of the event is probable. Development costs incurred subsequent to acquisition are treated consistently with internal project development costs.\n\n## Recognition and measurement\n\nIntangible assets are initially measured at cost, and are subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated amortisation and any impairment loss.\n\nFor intellectual property rights acquired for research and development projects, upfront fees and acquisition costs are capitalised as the historical cost. Subsequent milestone payments payable on achievement of a contingent event will be capitalised when the contingent event being achieved is probable. Intangible assets acquired in a business combination are recognised at fair value at the acquisition date.\n\nAmortisation is based on the straight-line method over the estimated useful life. This corresponds to the legal duration or the economic useful life depending on which is shorter, and not exceeding 25 years in either case. The amortisation of intellectual property rights commences after regulatory approval has been obtained or when assets are put in use.\n\nAmortisation of software is based on the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of 3-15 years. The amortisation commences when the asset is in the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by Management.",

        "page_content": "## Impairment test\n\nGoodwill and intangible assets with an indefinite useful life and intangible assets not yet available for use are tested for impairment when indicators of impairment exist. However, they are tested at least annually, irrespective of whether there is any indication that they may be impaired. Goodwill is allocated to operating segments based on expected future cash flow from products utilizing the synergies and know-how acquired.\n\nImpairment tests are based on Management's projections and anticipated net present value of estimated future cash flows from marketable products. The discount rate used is based on the Group WACC, adjusted where appropriate, to reflect the risk of the specific asset tested. Fair value is determined using largely unobservable inputs. Accordingly, the valuation technique and inputs used to measure fair value are classified as level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.\n\nAssets that are subject to amortisation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Factors considered material that could trigger an impairment test include the following:\n\n- \u00b7 Development of a competing drug\n- \u00b7 Realised sales trending below predicted sales\n- \u00b7 Changes or anticipated changes in participation rates or reimbursement policies\n- \u00b7 Inconsistent or unfavourable clinical readouts\n- \u00b7 Changes in the legal framework covering patents, rights and licences\n- \u00b7 Advances in medicine and/or technology that affect the medical treatments\n- \u00b7 Adverse impact on reputation and/or brand names\n- \u00b7 Changes in the economic lives of similar assets\n- \u00b7 Relationship to other intangible assets or property, plant and equipment\n\nIf the carrying amount of intangible assets exceeds the recoverable amount based on the existence of one or more of the above indicators of an impairment, any impairment is measured based on discounted projected cash flows. Impairments on intangible assets, other than goodwill, are reviewed at each reporting date for possible reversal.\n\n## KEY ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES ON INTANGIBLE ASSETS\n\nImpairment tests are based on Management's projections and anticipated net present value of estimated future cash flows from marketable products.\n\nWhen collaboration agreements contain elements of acquisition of intangible assets and research and development activities to be performed by the counterpart, Management estimates the allocation of payments that should be deferred to the acquisition of intangible assets and prepaid research and development activities respectively.\n\n## 3.2 Property, plant and equipment\n\n| DKK million                                                              | Land and  buildings   | Plant and  machinery   | Other  equipment   | Assets  under  construction   | Property,  plant and  equipment   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|------------------------|--------------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| 2023                                                                     |                       |                        |                    |                               |                                   |\n| Cost at the beginning of the year                                        | 43,403                | 37,548                 | 8,114              | 22,361                        | 111,426                           |\n| Additions during the year                                                | 2,681                 | 47                     | 873                | 27,830                        | 31,431                            |\n| Disposals during the year                                                | (690)                 | (952)                  | (624)              | (562)                         | (2,828)                           |\n| Transfer and reclassifications                                           | 4,246                 | 4,679                  | 731                | (9,656)                       | -

The right-of-use asset is presented in property, plant and equipment and the lease liability in borrowings.\n\nIn 2023, the total amount recognised in the income statement related to leases was DKK 1,832 million (DKK 1,491 million in 2022 and DKK 1,303 million DKK 2021). The total cash outflow for leases amounted to DKK 2,022 million (DKK 1,438 million in 2022 and DKK 1,275 million in 2021). As of 31 December 2023, the lease liability of DKK 5,726 million excludes potential lease payments of DKK 4,051 million (undiscounted) related to optional lease term extension rights on properties that were not considered reasonably certain to be exercised (DKK 3,723 million in 2022). Refer to note 4.6 for a maturity analysis of lease payments and 5.2 for commitments not recognised in the balance sheet related to leases.\n\n## ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\nProperty, plant and equipment is measured at historical cost less accumulated depreciations and any impairment loss. The cost of self-constructed assets includes costs directly attributable to the construction of the assets. Any subsequent cost is included in the asset's carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to Novo Nordisk, and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. Depreciation is based on the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the assets (buildings: 12-50 years, plant and machinery: 5-25 years and other equipment: 3-10 years. Land is not depreciated). Climate-related matters, including the commitment to reach net zero emissions, were considered when estimating the useful lives of property, plant and equipment.\n\nDepreciation commences when the asset is available for use, i.e. when it is in the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by Management. The asset's residual value and useful life is reviewed and adjusted, if appropriate, at the end of each reporting period. If an asset's carrying amount is higher than its estimated recoverable amount, it is written down to the recoverable amount. Plant and equipment with no alternative use developed as part of a research and development project are expensed. However, plant and equipment with an alternative use or used for general research and development purposes are capitalised and depreciated over the estimated useful life as research and development costs.\n\nFor contracts which are, or contain, a lease, the Group recognises a right-of-use asset and a lease liability. The right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, being the initial amount of the lease liability. The right-of-use asset is subsequently depreciated using the straight-line method over the lease term. The right-of-use asset is periodically adjusted for certain remeasurements of the lease liability and reduced by any impairment losses.\n\nThe lease term determined by the Group is the non-cancellable period of a lease, together with extension/termination option, if these are reasonably certain to be exercised. For contracts with a rolling term (evergreen leases), the Group estimates the leasing period to be equal to the termination period, if no probable scenario exists for estimating the leasing period.\n\nIf the lease liability is remeasured due to a change in future lease payments a corresponding adjustment is made to the right-of-use asset, or in the income statement when the right-of-use asset has been fully depreciated. For a description of accounting policies for lease liabilities, refer to note 4.9.\n\n## 3.3 Inventories\n\n| DKK million                                                                | 2023    | 2022    |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|\n| Raw materials                                                              | 9,500   | 6,392   |\n| Work in progress                                                           | 17,601  | 13,673  |\n| Finished goods                                                             | 7,224   | 6,038   |\n| Total inventories (gross)                                                  | 34,325  | 26,103  |\n| Write-downs at year-end                                                    | (2,514) | (1,715) |\n| Total inventories (net)                                                    | 31,811  | 24,388  |\n| Indirect production costs included in work in  progress and finished goods | 13,101  | 10,640  |\n| Share of total inventories (net)                                           | 41%     | 44%     |\n| Movements in inventory write-downs:                                        |         |         |\n| Write-downs at the beginning of the year                                   | 1,715   | 2,256   |\n| Write-downs during the year                                                | 1,808   | 1,110   |\n| Utilisation of write-downs                                                 | (718)   | (1,482) |\n| Reversal of write-downs                                                    | (291)   | (169)   |\n| Write-downs at the end of the year                                         | 2,514   | 1,715   |\n\nAll write-downs in both 2023 and 2022 relate to fully impaired inventory.\n\n## ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\nInventories are stated at cost or net realisable value, whichever is lower. Cost is determined using the first-in, first-out method. Cost comprises direct production costs such as raw materials, consumables and labour. Production costs for work in progress and finished goods include indirect production costs such as employee costs, depreciation, maintenance, etc. If the expected sales price less completion costs to execute sales (net realisable value) is lower than the carrying amount, a write-down is recognised for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds its net realisable value.\n\nInventory manufactured prior to regulatory approval (prelaunch inventory) is capitalised but immediately written down, until there is a high probability of regulatory approval for the product. The cost is recognised in the income statement as research and development costs. Once there is a high probability of regulatory approval being obtained, the write-down is reversed, up to no more than the original cost.",

Novo Nordisk closely monitors the current economic conditions of countries impacted by currency fluctuations, high inflation and an unstable political climate. These indicators, as well as payment history, are taken into account in the valuation of trade receivables. Overall, the country risk ratings in 2023 have remained unchanged from 2022. No loss allowance has been recognised on trade receivables in factoring portfolios in 2023 and 2022. Refer to note 4.4 for more information on the trade receivable programmes.\n\n## ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\nTrade receivables are initially recognised at transaction price and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less allowance for doubtful trade receivables. The split of trade receivables and allowance for trade receivables is based on the location of the customer.\n\nBefore being sold, trade receivables in factoring portfolios are measured at fair value with changes recognised in other comprehensive income. The allowance for doubtful receivables is deducted from the carrying amount of trade receivables, and the amount of the loss is recognised in the income statement under sales and distribution costs. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against sales and distribution costs.\n\nManagement makes allowance for doubtful trade receivables based on the simplified approach to provide for expected credit losses, which requires the use of the lifetime expected loss provision for all trade receivables. The allowance is an estimate based on shared credit risk characteristics and the days past due. Generally, invoices are due for payment within 90 days from shipment of goods. Loss allowance is calculated using an ageing factor, geographical risk and specific customer knowledge. The allowance is based on a provision matrix on days past due and a forward looking element relating mainly to incorporation of Dun & Bradstreet country risk ratings and an individual assessment. Refer to note 4.4 for a general description of credit risk.",

While provisions that Management deems to be reasonable and appropriate have been made for probable losses, there are inherent uncertainties connected with these estimates.\n\n## Pending litigation against Novo Nordisk\n\nSince January 2021, Novo Nordisk has made a number of changes to its policy in the US related to facilitating delivery of its discounted medicines to commercial pharmacies that contract with covered entities participating in the 340B Drug Pricing Program. On 30 January 2023, the US Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit issued a ruling holding that Novo Nordisk's drug distribution policy was consistent with the 340B statute. However, rulings in similar cases involving other manufacturers are pending before the US Courts of Appeals for the Seventh and DC Circuits, and such cases may be subject to further discretionary appellate review before the US Supreme Court. Depending on the outcome of any subsequent rulings and appeals in these matters, there may be a material impact on Novo Nordisk's financial position, net sales and cash flow.\n\nMosaic Health Inc. and Central Virginia Health Services, Inc. (both 340B covered entities) filed a putative class action lawsuit in Federal Court in New York against Novo Nordisk, Eli Lilly and Company, Sanofi and AstraZeneca alleging a conspiracy among the manufacturers to artificially fix prices of diabetes medications through changes to their policies relating to the distribution of 340B drugs. The lawsuit was\n\nsubsequently dismissed by the Court on 2 September 2022. Plaintiffs have filed an amended complaint. Novo Nordisk does not expect this matter to have a material impact on Novo Nordisk's financial position, operating profit or cash flow.\n\nNovo Nordisk is currently defending several lawsuits, including putative class actions, relating to the pricing of diabetes medicines in the US. The first lawsuit was filed in 2017 and in August 2023 a multi-district litigation was created in the United States District court for the District of New Jersey. Nearly all pending matters also name Eli Lilly and Company and Sanofi as defendants, while certain matters also name Pharmacy Benefit Managers (PBMs) and related entities. Plaintiffs generally allege that the manufacturers and PBMs colluded to artificially inflate list prices paid by consumers for diabetes products, while offering reduced prices to PBMs through rebates used to secure formulary access. Novo Nordisk does not expect the lawsuits to have a material impact on Novo Nordisk's financial position, operating profit or cash flow.\n\nIn 2016, Novo Nordisk received a Civil Investigative Demand (CID) from the US Department of Justice (DOJ) relating to potential off-label marketing of NovoSeven \u00ae (including high dose and for prophylactic use) and interactions with physicians and patients. The DOJ investigation was likely prompted by a lawsuit filed in 2015 by a former Novo Nordisk employee, who alleged Novo Nordisk caused the submission of false claims to Medicare, Medicaid, Federal Employees Health Benefits Program and private insurers in California as a result of the same conduct that was the subject of the DOJ CID. In May 2023, at the Plaintiffs' request, the case was transferred to the United\n\nStates District Court for the Western District of Washington. Following transfer, in July 2023, Plaintiffs filed a motion to revive their nationwide Medicare claims and their Delaware Medicaid claims. Novo Nordisk filed a motion to dismiss these claims. Novo Nordisk does not expect the lawsuits to have a material impact on Novo Nordisk's financial position, operating profit or cash flow.\n\nNovo Nordisk, along with Eli Lilly, are defendants in numerous product liability lawsuits (including in the US) related to the use of GLP-1-based treatments. Plaintiffs have alleged that the use of these treatments, including Ozempic \u00ae , Wegovy \u00ae and Rybelsus \u00ae , have caused various gastrointestinal and other injuries. Novo Nordisk is taking actions to address the lawsuits. Novo Nordisk does not expect these lawsuits to have a material impact on Novo Nordisk's financial position, operating profit or cash flow.\n\nPending claims against Novo Nordisk and Investigations involving Novo Nordisk Novo Nordisk has received Civil Investigative Demands (CIDs) or subpoenas from several US authorities including Attorneys General from the states of Minnesota, New Mexico, Washington, Colorado, Vermont, Texas and the US Federal Trade Commission that call for the production of documents and information relating to, among other things, the company's trade practices relating to its insulin and GLP-1-based products. Novo Nordisk is cooperating with the relevant government authorities in each of these investigative matters and does not expect these matters to have a material impact on Novo Nordisk's financial position, operating profit or cash flow.\n\nIn December 2021, Novo Nordisk received a CID from the DOJ relating to the company's financial relationships with healthcare professional and prescriptions for Ozempic \u00ae and Rybelsus \u00ae during the period of 1 January 2016 to present. Novo Nordisk is cooperating with the DOJ in this investigation and does not expect this matter to have a material impact on Novo Nordisk's financial position, operating profit or cash flow.\n\n## Other contingent liabilities\n\nIn addition to the above, Novo Nordisk is engaged in certain litigation proceedings and various ongoing audits and investigations. In the opinion of Management, neither settlement nor continuation of such proceedings, nor such pending audits and investigations, are expected to have a material effect on Novo Nordisk's financial position, operating profit or cash flow.",

        "page_content": "## ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\nProvisions for sales rebates and discounts granted to government agencies, wholesalers, retail pharmacies, Managed Care and other customers are recorded at the time the related revenues are recorded or when the incentives are offered. Provisions are calculated based on Management's interpretation of applicable laws and regulations, historical experience and the specific terms in the individual agreements. Unsettled rebates are recognised as provisions when the timing or amount is uncertain. Where absolute amounts are known, the rebates are recognised as other liabilities. Refer to note 2.1 for further information on sales rebates and provisions.\n\nProvisions for legal disputes are recognised where a legal or constructive obligation has been incurred as a result of past events and it is probable that there will be an outflow of resources that can be reliably estimated. In this case, Novo Nordisk arrives at an estimate based on an evaluation of the most likely outcome. Disputes for which no reliable estimate can be made are disclosed as contingent liabilities.\n\nProvisions are measured at the present value of the anticipated expenditure for settlement. This is calculated using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the obligation. The increase in the provision for interest is recognised as a financial expense.\n\nNovo Nordisk issues credit notes for expired goods as a part of normal business. Where there is historical experience or a reasonably accurate estimate of expected future returns can otherwise be made, a provision for estimated product returns is recorded. The provision is measured at gross sales value.\n\n## KEY ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES REGARDING ONGOING LEGAL DISPUTES, LITIGATION AND INVESTIGATIONS\n\nProvisions for legal disputes consist of various types of provisions linked to ongoing legal disputes. Management makes estimates regarding provisions and contingencies, including the probability of pending and potential future litigation outcomes. These are by nature dependent on inherently uncertain future events. When determining likely outcomes of litigation, etc., Management considers the input of external counsel on each case, as well as known outcomes in case law. Although Management believes that the total provisions for legal proceedings are adequate based on currently available information, there can be no assurance that there will not be any changes in facts or matters, or that any future lawsuits, claims, proceedings or investigations will not be material.",

A final dividend for 2023 of DKK 28,557 million (DKK 6.40 per share) is expected to be distributed pending approval at the Annual General Meeting. The interim dividend of DKK 13,430 million (DKK 3.00 per share) was declared and paid in August 2023. The total dividend for 2022 was DKK 27,950 million (DKK 6.20 per share), of which the final dividend of DKK 18,337 million (DKK 4.08 per share) was declared and paid in March 2023. No dividend is declared on treasury shares.\n\nNovo Nordisk's dividend pay-outs are complemented by share repurchase programmes.\n\n## 4.3 Share capital, Treasury shares and Other reserves\n\n## Development in number of shares\n\n| DKK million                    | A shares   | B shares   | Total   |\n|--------------------------------|------------|------------|---------|\n| Shares beginning of 2022       | 1,075      | 3,545      | 4,620   |\n| Shares cancelled in 2022       | -          | (60)       | (60)    |\n| Outstanding shares end of 2022 | 1,075      | 3,485      | 4,560   |\n| Shares cancelled in 2023       | -          | (50)       | (50)    |\n| Outstanding shares end of 2023 | 1,075      | 3,435      | 4,510   |\n\nAt the end of 2023, the share capital amounted to DKK 107 million in A share capital (DKK 107 million in 2022 and 2021) and DKK 344 million in B share capital (DKK 349 million in 2022 and DKK 355 million in 2021).\n\nThe A share capital and number of A shares of DKK 0.10 was in 2023 unchanged besides the effect of the split in trading units, and unchanged in 2022 and 2021. In 2023, the B share capital decreased by DKK 5 million (equal to cancellation of 50 million shares of DKK 0.10). The corresponding decrease in 2022 was DKK 6 million (equal to cancellation of 60 million shares of DKK 0.10) and decrease in 2021 of DKK 8 million (equal to cancellation of 80 million shares of DKK 0.10).\n\nEach A share of DKK 0.10 per share carries 100 votes and each B share of DKK 0.10 per share carries 10 votes.\n\n| Treasury shares                        | 2023 Market  value Number of  B shares of  DKK 0.10  (million)   | 2023 Market  value Number of  B shares of  DKK 0.10  (million)   | 2022 Number of  B shares of  DKK 0.10   |\n|----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|\n| Holding at the beginning of the year   | 28,242                                                           | 60.2                                                             | 62.2                                    |\n| Cancellation of treasury shares        | (23,450)                                                         | (50.0)                                                           | (60.0)                                  |\n| Released allocated shares to employees | (4,433)                                                          | (9.5)                                                            | (3.7)                                   |\n| Purchase during the year               | 29,924                                                           | 51.0                                                             | 61.7                                    |\n| Value adjustment                       | 5,817                                                            | -                                                                | -                                       |\n| Holding at the end of the year         | 36,100                                                           | 51.7                                                             | 60.2                                    |\n\nAt the end of 2023, the holding of treasury shares amounted to 1.1% of the total outstanding shares (1.3% of the outstanding shares in 2022). Treasury shares are primarily acquired to reduce the company's share capital. In addition, a limited part is used to finance Novo Nordisk's long-term share-based incentive programme and restricted stock units to employees. Treasury shares are deducted from the share capital on cancellation at their nominal value of DKK 0.10 per share. Differences between this amount and the amount paid to acquire or received for disposing of treasury shares are deducted directly in retained earnings.\n\nThe purchase of treasury shares during the year relates to the remaining part of the 2022 share repurchase programme, totalling DKK 1.5 billion and the DKK 30 billion Novo Nordisk B share repurchase programme for 2023, of which DKK 1.6 billion was outstanding at year-end. The programme ended on 29 January 2024.\n\nThe trading unit of the Novo Nordisk B shares listed on NASDAQ Copenhagen and the ADRs listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) was split in 2023. Comparative figures have been restated to reflect the split.",

Dividends are declared and paid from distributable reserves.

The overall objectives and policies for the company's financial risk management are outlined in the internal Treasury Policy, which is approved by the Board of Directors. The Treasury Policy consists of the Foreign Exchange Policy, the Investment Policy, the Financing Policy and the Policy regarding Credit Risk on Financial Counterparts, and includes a description of permitted use of financial instruments and risk limits.\n\nNovo Nordisk only hedges commercial exposures and consequently does not enter into derivative transactions for trading or speculative purposes. Novo Nordisk uses a fully integrated treasury management system to manage all financial positions, and all positions are marked-to-market.\n\n## Foreign exchange risk\n\nForeign exchange risk is the most important financial risk for Novo Nordisk and can have a significant impact on the income statement, statement of comprehensive income, balance sheet and cash flow statement. The majority of Novo Nordisk's sales are in USD, EUR, CNY, CAD, JPY and GBP. The foreign exchange risk is most significant in USD, CNY and CAD, while the EUR exchange rate risk is regarded as low because of Denmark's fixed exchange rate policy towards EUR. The overall objective of foreign exchange risk management is to reduce the short-term negative impact of exchange rate fluctuations on earnings and cash flow, thereby contributing to the predictability of the financial results. Novo Nordisk hedges existing assets and liabilities in key currencies as well as future expected cash flows up to a maximum of 24 months forward.\n\nHedge accounting is applied to match the impact of the hedged item and the hedging instrument in the consolidated income statement. The currency hedging strategy balances risk reduction and cost of hedging by use of foreign exchange forwards and foreign exchange options matching the due dates of the hedged items. Expected cash flows are continually assessed using historical inflows, budgets and monthly sales forecasts.\n\nHedge effectiveness is assessed on a regular basis. Management has chosen to classify the result of hedging activities as part of financial items.\n\n## Key currencies\n\n|                                              | USD                                          | CNY                                          | CAD                                          | JPY                                          | GBP                                          |\n|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|\n| Average exchange rate applied (DKK per 100)  | Average exchange rate applied (DKK per 100)  | Average exchange rate applied (DKK per 100)  | Average exchange rate applied (DKK per 100)  | Average exchange rate applied (DKK per 100)  | Average exchange rate applied (DKK per 100)  |\n| 2023                                         | 689                                          | 97                                           | 511                                          | 4.91                                         | 857                                          |\n| 2022                                         | 708                                          | 105                                          | 543                                          | 5.40                                         | 873                                          |\n| 2021                                         | 629                                          | 97                                           | 502                                          | 5.73                                         | 865                                          |\n| Year-end exchange rate applied (DKK per 100) | Year-end exchange rate applied (DKK per 100) | Year-end exchange rate applied (DKK per 100) | Year-end exchange rate applied (DKK per 100) | Year-end exchange rate applied (DKK per 100) | Year-end exchange rate applied (DKK per 100) |\n| 2023                                         | 674                                          | 95                                           | 509                                          | 4.77                                         | 858                                          |\n| 2022                                         | 697                                          | 101                                          | 515                                          | 5.29                                         | 838                                          |\n| 2021                                         | 657                                          | 103                                          | 517                                          | 5.70                                         | 885                                          |\n\nForeign exchange rate sensitivity analysis\n\nAt year-end, an immediate 5% decrease in the disclosed currencies versus DKK and EUR is estimated by Management to have the following impact on Novo Nordisk's operating profit for the next 12 months.\n\n## Sensitivity on operating profit of an immediate 5% decrease in key currencies 1\n\n|   DKK million | USD     | CNY   | CAD   | JPY   | GBP   |\n|---------------|---------|-------|-------|-------|-------|\n|          2024 | (5,700) | (500) | (530) | (210) | (150) |\n|          2023 | (3,180) | (500) | (320) | (240) | (160) |\n\nAs per the end of 2023, a positive market value of financial contracts related to hedging of foreign exchange risk of DKK 1,612 million had been deferred for recognition in 2024 (in 2022 a positive market value of DKK 1,026 million was deferred for recognition in 2023).",

In addition, Novo Nordisk considers its maximum credit exposure to trade receivables, other receivables (less prepayments and VAT receivables) and other financial assets to be DKK 67,209 million (DKK 52,714 million in 2022). Refer to note 4.9 for details of the Group's total financial assets.\n\nTo manage credit risk regarding financial counterparties, Novo Nordisk only enters into derivative financial contracts and money market deposits with financial counterparties possessing a satisfactory long-term credit rating from at least two of the three selected rating agencies: Standard and Poor's, Moody's and Fitch. Furthermore, maximum credit lines defined for each counterparty diversify the overall counterparty risk. The credit risk on marketable securities is low, as investments are made in highly liquid bonds with predominantly AAA credit ratings.\n\n## Credit risk exposure to non-financial counterparties\n\nOutside the US, Novo Nordisk has no significant concentration of credit risk related to trade receivables or other receivables and prepayments, because the exposure in general is spread over a large number of counterparties and customers. In the US, the three major wholesalers account for a large proportion of total net sales, see note 2.1. However, US wholesaler credit ratings are monitored, and part of the trade receivables are sold on full non-recourse terms; see below for details.\n\nNovo Nordisk closely monitors the current economic conditions of countries impacted by currency fluctuations, high inflation and an unstable political climate. These indicators, as well as payment history are taken into account in the valuation of trade receivables. The country risk ratings in 2023 have overall remained unchanged from 2022 to 2023.\n\n## Trade receivable programmes\n\nAt year-end, the Group had derecognised receivables without recourse having due dates after 31 December 2023 amounting to:\n\n| DKK million   | 2023   | 2022   | 2021   |\n|---------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| US            | 5,059  | 1,394  | 1,313  |\n| Japan         | 2,050  | 2,273  | 2,453  |\n\nNovo Nordisk's subsidiaries in the US and Japan employ trade receivable programmes in which trade receivables are sold on full non-recourse terms to optimise working capital.\n\nRefer to note 3.4 for the split of allowance for trade receivables by geographical segment.\n\n## Interest rate risk\n\nNovo Nordisk's exposure to interest rate risk is considered to be low due to the capital structure. Non-current debt consists of fixed rate instruments. Interest rate risk on marketable securities of DKK 15,838 million is considered low due to a low portfolio duration.\n\n## Liquidity risk\n\nThe liquidity risk is considered to be low. Novo Nordisk ensures the availability of the required liquidity through a combination of cash management, highly liquid investment portfolios and both uncommitted and committed credit facilities. Novo Nordisk uses cash pools for optimisation and centralisation of cash management.",

Average hedge rate for USD cash flow hedges is 676 at the end of 2023 (696 at the end of 2022) and average hedge rate for USD fair value hedges is 675 at the end of 2023 (714 at the end of 2022).  2. For 2022 the relevant currencies are CAD, JPY and GBP.\n\nThe fair value of cash flow hedges at year-end 2023, a gain of DKK 1,612 million, has been recognised in other comprehensive income.\n\nThe financial contracts are expected to impact the income statement within the next 12 months, with deferred gains and losses on cash flow hedges then being transferred to financial income or financial expenses. There is no expected ineffectiveness at 31 December 2023, primarily because hedging instruments match currencies of hedged cash flows.\n\n## Use of derivative financial instruments\n\nThe derivative financial instruments are used to manage the exposure to foreign exchange risk. None of the derivatives are held for trading. Novo Nordisk uses forward exchange contracts to hedge forecast transactions, assets and liabilities. Net investments in foreign subsidiaries are currently not hedged.\n\n## ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\nOn initiation of the contract, Novo Nordisk designates each derivative financial contract that qualifies for hedge accounting as one of:\n\n- \u00b7 hedges of the fair value of a recognised asset or liability (fair value hedge)\n- \u00b7 hedges of the fair value of a forecast financial transaction (cash flow hedge).\n\nAll contracts are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently remeasured at fair value at the end of the reporting period.\n\n## Fair value hedges\n\nValue adjustments of fair value hedges are recognised in the income statement along with any value adjustments of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk.\n\n## Cash flow hedges\n\nValue adjustments of the effective part of cash flow hedges are recognised in other comprehensive income. The cumulative value adjustment of these contracts is transferred from other comprehensive income to the income statement when the hedged transaction is recognised in the income statement. For cash flow hedges of foreign currency risk on highly probable non-financial asset purchases, the cumulative value adjustments are transferred directly from the cash flow hedge reserve to the initial cost of the asset when recognised.\n\n## Discontinuance of cash flow hedging\n\nWhen a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised when the forecasted transaction is ultimately recognised in the income statement. When a forecasted transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in equity is immediately transferred to the income statement under financial income or financial expenses.\n\nFor additional disclosures on accounting policies for financial instruments refer to note 4.9.",

Net proceeds of the issuances were used for general corporate purposes, including refinancing of the bridge loan facility established in connection with Novo Nordisk's acquisition of Dicerna Pharmaceuticals, Inc. No bonds have been issued in 2023. The total fair value of issued Eurobonds amounts to DKK 19.7 billion (DKK 18.7 billion in 2022).\n\n## ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\nThe lease liabilities are related to IFRS 16 leases, primarily for premises and company cars and include the present value of future lease payments during the lease term. Lease liabilities are initially measured at the present value of the lease payments outstanding at the commencement date, discounted using the incremental borrowing rate. The lease liability is measured using the effective interest method. The lease liability is subsequently remeasured to reflect changes in future lease payments, e.g. changes in lease terms. Issued bonds, loans and bank overdrafts are initially recognised at the fair value of the proceeds received less transaction costs. In subsequent periods these are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. The difference between the proceeds received and the nominal value is recognised in financial income or financial expenses over the term of the loan. Where substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are retained in financial assets that have been transferred, the assets are not derecognised and the proceeds obtained are recognised as a financial liability. For fair value determination refer to note 4.9.",

There were no transfers between the 'Active market data' and 'Directly or indirectly observable market data' categories during 2023 or 2022. The fair value of issued Eurobonds, which is disclosed in note 4.6, are based on 'Active market data'. There are no significant intangible assets or items of property, plant and equipment measured at fair value. For a description of the credit quality of financial assets such as trade receivables, cash at bank, current debt and derivative financial instruments, refer to notes 4.4 and 4.5.\n\n## ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\nDepending on purpose, Novo Nordisk classifies financial instruments into the following categories:\n\n- \u00b7 Financial assets at fair value through the income statement\n- \u00b7 Derivatives used as hedging instruments\n- \u00b7 Financial assets at amortised cost\n- \u00b7 Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income\n- \u00b7 Financial liabilities at amortised cost\n\n## Recognition and measurement\n\nFinancial assets measured at fair value through the income statement consist of other financial assets, which comprise of equity investments, and marketable securities. These financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value. Net gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of equity instruments and marketable securities are recognised in the income statement as financial income or expenses.\n\nFor a description of accounting policies on derivative financial instruments designated to hedge accounting, refer to note 4.5.\n\nFinancial assets at amortised cost are cash at bank and non-derivative financial assets solely with payments of principal and interest. Novo Nordisk normally 'holds-to-collect' the financial assets to attain the contractual cash flows. If collection is expected within one year (or in the normal operating cycle of the business, if longer), they are classified as current assets. If not, they are presented as non-current assets. These are initially measured at fair value less transaction costs, except for trade receivables that are initially measured at the transaction price. Subsequently, they are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method less impairment. For a description of accounting policies on trade receivables, refer to note 3.4.\n\nFinancial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income are trade receivables that are held to collect or to sell in factoring agreements.\n\nFinancial liabilities at amortised cost consist of borrowings (loans, issued Eurobonds, bank overdrafts and lease liabilities), trade payables and other liabilities (primarily employee cost payables, payables related to assets under construction, sales rebates and deferred income). These are initially recognised at the fair value less transaction costs. Subsequently, they are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. For initial recognition of lease liabilities refer to note 4.6.\n\n## Fair value measurement\n\nIf an active market exists, the fair value of a financial instrument is based on the most recently observed market price at the end of the reporting period. If a financial instrument is quoted in a market that is not active, Novo Nordisk bases its valuation on the most recent transaction price. Adjustment is made for subsequent changes in market conditions, for instance by including transactions in similar financial instruments assumed to be motivated by normal business considerations. The fair values of quoted investments are based on current bid prices at the end of the reporting period.\n\nFinancial assets for which no active market exists are carried at fair value based on a valuation methodology. The fair value of such financial instruments are determined on the basis of quoted market prices of financial instruments traded in active markets. The fair value of standard and simple financial instruments, such as foreign exchange forward contracts, interest rate swaps, currency swaps and unlisted bonds, is measured according to generally accepted valuation techniques. Market-based input is used to measure the fair value.\n\nThe fair value of trade receivables in a factoring portfolio is calculated based on the net invoice amount (invoice amount less charge-backs) less the fee payable to the factoring entity. The factoring fee is insignificant due to the short period between the time of sale to the factoring entity and the invoice due date and the rate applicable. Inputs into the estimate of US wholesaler charge-backs are described in note 2.1.",

In 2021, Novo Nordisk introduced a new share-based compensation programme with terms, which amortises the grant date valuation over three years (the 2020 programme was amortised over four years). The 2023 expense includes amortisation of the 2020, 2021, 2022 and 2023 programmes.\n\n## Restricted stock units to employees\n\nIn connection with Novo Nordisk's 100 year anniversary and in appreciation of the efforts of employees during recent years, as of 1 February 2023, all eligible employees in the company were offered 74 restricted stock units. Each restricted stock unit gives the holder the right to receive one Novo Nordisk B share free of charge in August 2026, subject to continued employment. The cost of the DKK 1,331 million programme is amortised over the vesting period.\n\n## Long-term share-based incentive programme\n\n## Management Board\n\nDuring 2023, Management Board participated in four long-term incentive programmes (LTIP) which commenced in 2020, 2021, 2022 and 2023 respectively.\n\nThe LTIPs commenced in 2021, 2022 and 2023 have a three-year performance period, subject to continued employment, and a subsequent two-year holding period. Targets are set at the beginning of the performance period and include determination of threshold, on-target level of performance and level of performance to achieve maximum allocation of shares. The maximum share allocation at grant cannot exceed 26 months' base salary for the CEO, 19.5 months' base salary for executive vice presidents and up to 15.6 months' base salary for senior vice presidents. Hence the LTIP is capped at a number of shares at the time of grant. Financial targets are set by the Board for a three-year period, and are linked to three-year average growth in sales and operating profit, while every year the Board has set the non-financial targets for a one-year period. All targets are aligned to Novo Nordisk's Strategic Aspirations 2025: Purpose and sustainability, Innovation and therapeutic focus, Commercial execution and Financials. Target achievement is assessed by the Board.\n\nThe grant date of the 2023-programme was February 2023, and the share price used for the determining the grant date fair value of the award (DKK 456) was the average share price for Novo Nordisk B shares on Nasdaq Copenhagen in the period 2-16 February 2023, adjusted for the expected dividend. Based on the split of participants at the grant date, 46% of the allocated shares is be allocated to members of Executive Management and 54% to other members of the Management Board.\n\nThe LTIP which commenced in 2020 is likewise subject to a three-year performance period in which the number of allocated shares may increase or decrease in line with performance, which is linked to financial targets, including sales growth and economic value creation, and non-financial targets, including achievement of clinical trial milestones and market authorisation for specific products. The maximum share allocation is capped in a similar way as the LTIPs described above.\n\nAll restricted stock units and shares allocated to Management are settled by transfers of treasury shares at the time of vesting.\n\n## Management group below the Management Board\n\nThe Management group below the Management Board has a share-based incentive programme with similar performance criteria as Management Board. Financial targets are set by the Board for a three-year period, while the non-financial targets have been set by the Board each year.\n\nOn 31 December 2023, a total of 18.9 million shares (21.4 million in 2022 and 19.8 million in 2021) were outstanding including all ongoing programmes.\n\n## ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\nNovo Nordisk operates equity-settled, share-based compensation plans. The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant of shares is recognised as an expense and allocated over the vesting period.\n\nThe total amount to be expensed over the performance and vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of the shares granted, excluding the impact of any non-market vesting conditions. The fair value is fixed at the grant date, and adjusted for expected dividends during the vesting period. Non-market vesting conditions are included in assumptions about the number of shares that are expected to vest. At the end of each reporting period, Novo Nordisk revises its estimates of the number of shares expected to vest. Novo Nordisk recognises the impact of the revision of the original estimates, if any, in the income statement and in a corresponding adjustment to equity (change in proceeds) over the remaining vesting period. Adjustments relating to previous years are included in the income statement in the year of adjustment.",

Predominantly relates to estimated variable property taxes, leases committed but not yet commenced and low value leases.  2. Potential milestone payments are associated with uncertainty because they are linked to successful achievements in research activities.\n\n## Contractual obligations\n\nResearch and development obligations include contingent payments related to achieving development milestones. Such amounts entail uncertainties in relation to the period in which payments are due because a proportion of the obligations are dependent on milestone achievements. Exercise fees and subsequent milestone payments under in-licensing option agreements are excluded, as Novo Nordisk is not contractually obligated to make such payments. Commercial product launch milestones include contingent payments solely related to achievement of a commercial product launch following regulatory approval. The increase in research and development obligation is driven by the general increase in business activities.\n\nCommercial milestones, royalties and other payments based on a percentage of sales generated from sale of goods following marketing approval are excluded from the contractual commitments analysis because of their contingent nature, related to future sales.\n\nThe purchase obligations related to investments in property, plant and equipment primarily relates to production capacity expansion projects. Novo Nordisk expects to fund these commitments with existing cash and cash flow from operations.\n\nOther purchase commitments mainly consist of commitments related to promotional and media activities, professional and consulting activities and strategic sourcing contracts.\n\nThe contractual obligations not recognised in the balance sheet represent contractual payments and are not discounted and are not risk-adjusted.\n\n## Other guarantees\n\nOther guarantees amount to DKK 1,878 million (DKK 1,222 million in 2022). Other guarantees primarily relate to performance guarantees issued by Novo Nordisk.\n\n## 5.3 Acquisition of businesses\n\n## Fair value recognised at date of acquisition\n\n| DKK million                             | 2022 Forma Therapeutics   |\n|-----------------------------------------|---------------------------|\n| Intellectual property rights            | 5,766                     |\n| Other intangible assets                 | 492                       |\n| Financial assets                        | 77                        |\n| Marketable securities                   | 1,470                     |\n| Cash                                    | 1,027                     |\n| Deferred tax assets (liabilities), net  | (709)                     |\n| Other net assets                        | (21)                      |\n| Net identifiable assets acquired        | 8,102                     |\n| Goodwill                                | -                         |\n| Consideration transferred               | 8,102                     |\n| Cash acquired                           | (1,027)                   |\n| Cash used for acquisition of businesses | 7,075                     |\n\n## Business combinations in 2023\n\nNo transactions completed during 2023 were classified as acquisitions of businesses.\n\n## Business combinations in 2022\n\nOn 14 October 2022, Novo Nordisk acquired all outstanding shares of the publicly held US company Forma Therapeutics Holdings, Inc. at a price of USD 20 per share via a cash tender offer, equal to a total purchase price of DKK 8,102 million. At end of 2022, the initial accounting for goodwill, intellectual property rights, other intangible assets and deferred tax assets and liabilities remained provisional. The valuation of these were finalised in 2023 with the result that net deferred tax liabilities were reduced retrospectively by DKK 524 million to a total of DKK 709 million. The reduction was offset by a corresponding amount to goodwill. The valuation of intellectual property rights and other intangible assets remain unchanged.",

Any amount of the purchase price which effectively comprises a settlement of a pre-existing relationship is not part of the exchange for the acquiree and is therefore not included in the consideration for the purpose of applying the acquisition method. Settlements of pre-existing relationships are accounted for as separate transactions in accordance with the relevant IFRS standards.\n\nIdentifiable assets and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed are measured at fair value at the date of acquisition by applying relevant valuation methods. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred. Goodwill is recognised at the excess of purchase price over the fair value of net identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed.\n\n## KEY ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES IN DETERMINING THE FAIR VALUE OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS\n\nThe application of the acquisition method involves the use of significant estimates because the identifiable net assets of the acquiree are recognised at their fair value for which observable market prices are typically not available. This is particularly relevant for intangible assets which require use of valuation techniques typically based on estimates of present value of future uncertain cash flows. For the 2022 acquisition of Forma Therapeutics Holdings, Inc. valuations of intellectual property rights were based on estimated and risk adjusted net present value of future cash flows.\n\n## 5.4 Related party transactions\n\n## Material transactions with related parties\n\n| DKK million                           | 2023   | 2022   | 2021   |\n|---------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Novo Holdings A/S                     |        |        |        |\n| Purchase of Novo Nordisk B shares     | 8,775  | 6,984  | 6,695  |\n| Dividend payment to Novo Holdings A/S | 9,028  | 7,207  | 6,144  |\n| NNIT Group                            |        |        |        |\n| Services provided by NNIT             | 436    | 660    | 593    |\n| Dividend payment from NNIT            | -      | -      | (4)    |\n| Altasciences Group                    |        |        |        |\n| Services provided by Novo Nordisk     | -      | -      | -      |\n| Services provided by Altasciences     | 229    | 70     | 11     |\n| Novozymes Group                       |        |        |        |\n| Services provided by Novo Nordisk     | (48)   | (78)   | (116)  |\n| Services provided by Novozymes        | 112    | 92     | 78     |\n\nNovo Nordisk A/S is controlled by Novo Holdings A/S (incorporated in Denmark), which owns 28.1% of the share capital in Novo Nordisk A/S, representing 77.1% of the total number of votes. The remaining shares are widely held. The ultimate parent of the Group is the Novo Nordisk Foundation (incorporated in Denmark). Both entities are considered related parties.\n\nAs associated companies of Novo Nordisk A/S, NNIT Group and Churchill Stateside Solar Fund XIV, LLC ('CS Solar Fund XIV') are considered related parties. As associated companies of Novo Holdings A/S, Unchained Labs, Inc. and Altasciences Company Inc. are considered related parties to Novo Nordisk A/S. As Novo Holdings is a controlling shareholder, the Novozymes Group, Sonion Group and Xellia Pharmaceuticals are also considered to be related parties, as well as the Board of Directors and Executive Management of Novo Nordisk A/S.\n\nIn 2023, Novo Nordisk A/S acquired 14,025 B shares, worth DKK 8.8 billion, from Novo Holdings A/S as part of the DKK 30.0 billion share repurchase programme. The transaction price for each transaction was calculated as the average market price in the open window period following the announcements of the financial results for the first and third quarters in 2023.\n\nThere were no transactions with the Board of Directors or Executive Management besides remuneration.\n\nThere were no material unsettled balances with related parties at the end of the year.\n\n## 5.5 Fees to statutory auditors\n\n| DKK million                      |   2023 |   2022 |   2021 |\n|----------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Statutory audit 1                |     30 |     38 |     26 |\n| Audit-related services           |      3 |      2 |      3 |\n| Tax advisory services            |      8 |      3 |      4 |\n| Other services                   |     18 |     12 |      4 |\n| Total fees to statutory auditors |     59 |     55 |     37 |\n\n1. 2022 statutory audit fee includes DKK 9 million of additional fee related to 2021.\n\nFees for services other than statutory audit of the financial statements amount to DKK 29 million (DKK 17 million in 2022 and DKK 11 million in 2021).\n\nIn 2023, Deloitte Statsautoriseret Revisionspartnerselskab provided other services than statutory audit in the amount of DKK 18 million (DKK 12 million in 2022 and DKK 6 million in 2021) which relate to tax due diligence and transfer pricing, management consulting for strategic projects, leadership training, review of ESG data and other assurance assessments and opinions.",

These non-IFRS financial measures may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner, and may therefore not be comparable.\n\nThe non-IFRS financial measures presented in the Annual Report are:\n\n- \u00b7 Net sales and operating profit in constant exchange rates (CER)\n- \u00b7 'Net profit', adjusted for 'income taxes', 'financial items', 'depreciation and amortisation' and 'impairment losses' (EBITDA)\n- \u00b7 Return on invested capital (ROIC)\n- \u00b7 Free cash flow\n- \u00b7 Cash to earnings\n\n## IFRS refers to an IFRS financial measure.\n\n## Sales and operating profit growth in constant exchange rates\n\n'Growth in constant exchange rates' means that the effect of changes in exchange rates is excluded. It is defined as sales/operating profit for the period measured at the average exchange rates for the same period of the prior year, compared with net sales/operating profit for the same period of the prior year. Price adjustments within hyperinflation countries as defined in IAS 29 'Financial reporting in hyperinflation economies' are excluded from the calculation to avoid growth in constant exchange rates being artificially inflated. Growth in constant exchange rates is considered to be relevant information for investors in order to understand the underlying development in sales and operating profit by adjusting for the impact of currency fluctuations.\n\n## Net sales in constant exchange rates\n\n| DKK million                                        | 2023    | 2022     | 2021    |\n|----------------------------------------------------|---------|----------|---------|\n| Net sales  IFRS                                    | 232,261 | 176,954  | 140,800 |\n| Effect of exchange rate                            | 7,658   | (13,024) | 3,643   |\n| Net sales in constant exchange rates               | 239,919 | 163,930  | 144,443 |\n| Net sales previous year                            | 176,954 | 140,800  | 126,946 |\n| % increase/(decrease) in reported currencies       | 31.3%   | 25.7%    | 10.9%   |\n| % increase/(decrease) in constant   exchange rates | 35.6%   | 16.4%    | 13.8%   |\n\n## Operating profit in constant exchange rates\n\n| DKK million                                        | 2023    | 2022    | 2021   |\n|----------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|--------|\n| Operating profit  IFRS                             | 102,574 | 74,809  | 58,644 |\n| Effect of exchange rate                            | 4,898   | (7,578) | 2,332  |\n| Operating profit in constant exchange rates        | 107,472 | 67,231  | 60,976 |\n| Operating profit previous year                     | 74,809  | 58,644  | 54,126 |\n| % increase/(decrease) in reported currencies       | 37.1%   | 27.6%   | 8.3%   |\n| % increase/(decrease) in constant   exchange rates | 43.7%   | 14.6%   | 12.7%  |\n\n## Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortisation and impairment losses (EBITDA)\n\nEBITDA is defined as 'net profit', before 'income taxes', 'financial items', 'depreciation and amortisation' and 'impairment losses'.\n\nManagement believes EBITDA is a useful measure as it helps analyse operating results from core business operations without including the effects of capital structure, tax rates, depreciation, amortisation and impairment losses.\n\nThe following table shows a reconciliation of EBITDA with operating profit, the most directly comparable IFRS financial measures:\n\n## EBITDA\n\n| DKK million                    | 2023    | 2022   | 2021    |\n|--------------------------------|---------|--------|---------|\n| Net profit  IFRS               | 83,683  | 55,525 | 47,757  |\n| Income taxes  IFRS             | 20,991  | 13,537 | 11,323  |\n| Financial income  IFRS         | (2,945) | (239)  | (2,887) |\n| Financial expenses  IFRS       | 845     | 5,986  | 2,451   |\n| Operating profit (EBIT) IFRS   | 102,574 | 74,809 | 58,644  |\n| Depreciation and amortisations | 7,289   | 6,553  | 5,311   |\n| Impairment losses              | 2,124   | 809    | 714     |\n| EBITDA                         | 111,987 | 82,171 | 64,669  |",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the consolidated ESG statement\n\n## Section 6 Basis of preparation\n\n## General reporting standards and principles\n\nNovo Nordisk's annual reporting complies with the Danish Financial Statements Act. Sections 99a, 99b, 99d and 107d specify the requirements to report on the management of risks related to the environment, climate, human rights, labour and social conditions, anti-corruption, gender distribution and data ethics. These requirements are addressed in the Management review.\n\nAs recommended by the Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), Novo Nordisk is working to integrate two climate change scenarios into the risk management process, to identify short-, medium- and long-term risks within the production and supply chain:\n\n- \u00b7 Limiting temperature increase to well below 2\u00baC scenario, preferably 1.5\u00baC, compared to pre-industrial times in accordance with the Paris Agreement.\n- \u00b7 A temperature increase of 4\u00baC scenario as an alternative high-emission scenario.\n\nScope 1, 2 and 3 emissions have been prepared in accordance with the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol. Novo Nordisk also discloses in accordance with the recommendations put forward by the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP). For a full breakdown of climate and water impacts, please refer to the publicly available report on Novo Nordisk's CDP disclosures at: www.cdp.net.\n\n## Inclusivity\n\nAs a pharmaceutical business with global reach, Novo Nordisk is committed to being accountable to those stakeholders who are impacted by the organisation. From the perspective of social responsibility, the key stakeholder groups are patients who rely on Novo Nordisk's products, employees at Novo Nordisk and throughout the Group's value chain, business partners and local communities. Novo Nordisk maps its stakeholders and has processes in place to ensure inclusion of stakeholder concerns and expectations.\n\n## Responsiveness\n\nThe Annual Report reflects how Novo Nordisk manages operations in ways that consider and respond to stakeholder concerns and interests. The report reaches out to a wide range of stakeholders but is primarily prepared with investors in mind. For most Novo Nordisk stakeholders, the Annual Report is just one element of interaction and communication with the Company.\n\n## Impact\n\nUnderstanding, measuring and communicating the positive and negative impacts on society and the planet of Novo Nordisk's activities is important and remains a priority for Novo Nordisk.\n\n## Materiality\n\nThe 2023 consolidated ESG statement includes KPIs as guided by Novo Nordisk's ESG strategy and ongoing external stakeholder engagement. When assessing whether a KPI is material to the consolidated ESG statement, Management considers whether the matter is of such relevance and importance that it could substantially influence the assessment of Novo Nordisk's ESG performance by the users of the Annual Report 2023.\n\nThe provisional Double Materiality Assessment described on page 12, performed at the end of 2023, will inform our ESG reporting in 2024 in accordance with the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) and will be updated regularly.\n\n## Principles of consolidation\n\nThe disclosures of energy consumption and CO 2 e emissions cover production sites, laboratories and offices. The disclosures of water consumption, environmental breaches and waste cover production sites. Novo Nordisk Engineering A/S is not included in our environmental reporting.\n\nThe social and governance-related disclosures cover the Novo Nordisk Group, comprising Novo Nordisk A/S and entities controlled by Novo Nordisk A/S. Novo Nordisk Engineering A/S is not included in our reporting for Sustainable employer score, employees trained in business ethics, failed inspections and facilitations of the Novo Nordisk Way. Novo Nordisk Pharmatech A/S is not included in our reporting on employees trained in business ethics and facilitations of the Novo Nordisk Way.\n\n## Changes in accounting policies and disclosures\n\nThe accounting policies set out in the notes have been applied consistently in the preparation of the consolidated ESG statement for all the years presented, unless stated otherwise.\n\nThe following changes to accounting policies and new KPIs have been considered in the 2023 consolidated ESG statement:\n\n## Environmental performance\n\nIn 2022, scope 1 emissions, scope 2 emissions and scope 3 emissions from business travel were calculated as CO 2 . To further align with the GHG Protocol, in 2023 these KPIs are calculated as CO 2 e. The remaining scope 3 emissions have been calculated as CO 2 e in 2022 and 2023. CO 2 e includes CO 2 and all other greenhouse gases; for more information, please refer to section 7.2. Additionally, scope 1 emissions have been expanded to also include refrigerants. Further scope changes may occur in the future as more data becomes available.\n\nIn 2023, the methodology for counting the number of breaches of regulatory limit values was changed. Breaches related to the same continued exceedance at the same site are counted as one breach for the year. Comparative figures for 2021 and 2022 have been adjusted accordingly. Please refer to section 7.5.\n\n## Social performance\n\nThe KPI on patients reached has been expanded to include patients reached with Novo Nordisk's Obesity care products. Comparative figures for 2021 and 2022 have been adjusted accordingly; please refer to section 8.1. New breakdowns including comparative figures for 2021 and 2022 have been included on employees by gender and by age group. Please refer to section 8.2.\n\n## Governance performance\n\nNew KPIs including comparative figures for 2021 and 2022 have been included on number of substantiated cases reported via the Compliance Hotline and convictions for violation of anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws. Please refer to section 9.2.",

This included utilising more renewable natural gas and steam, reducing propane, diesel and heavy fuel usage, and implementing new dehumidification systems. Energy-saving projects implemented in 2023 within production sites resulted in annual energy savings of 64 thousand GJ. These efforts could not fully mitigate the increased production volumes, ramp-up activities and impact from adverse local weather conditions, and consequently energy consumption for production increased by 4%.\n\nEnergy consumption in office buildings and laboratories decreased by 3% due to reduced use of facilities and implementation of energy-saving measures.\n\nSince 2020, Novo Nordisk has transitioned to sourcing 100% renewable power for production through a mix of solutions, primarily Renewable Electricity Certificates (REC), Power Purchase Agreements (PPA), Guarantees of Origin (GO) as well as onsite renewable solutions.\n\n## ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\nEnergy consumption for operations is measured as consumption of power, steam, heat and fuel. Fuel is mainly natural gas, wood, diesel oil, gas oil and light fuel oil. Energy consumption is based on metre readings and invoices. Energy consumption in office buildings outside of Denmark is limited to the consumption of power.\n\nThe share of renewable power used at production sites is reported according to the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol scope 2 Guideline. The market-based method is used to account for renewable power at production sites through procurement of contractual instruments such as Energy Attribute Certificates (EAC), PPAs and GOs from sources such as wind, hydro, solar and biomass. Contractual instruments are procured based on the total consumption of power in each country involved in production.\n\n## 7.2 Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions\n\n| 1,000 tonnes CO 2 e                           | 2023   | 2022   | 2021   |\n|-----------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Scope 1 1                                     | 78     | 76     | 77     |\n| \u00b7  Production                                 | 31     | 25     | 29     |\n| \u00b7  Office buildings and laboratories          | 1      | 3      | 2      |\n| \u00b7  Company cars                               | 46     | 48     | 46     |\n| Scope 2 1                                     | 15     | 16     | 16     |\n| \u00b7  Production                                 | 12     | 11     | 10     |\n| \u00b7  Office buildings and laboratories          | 3      | 5      | 6      |\n| Scope 3 2                                     | 3,738  | 2,418  | N/A    |\n| \u00b7  Purchased goods and services 3             | 2,067  | 1,473  | N/A    |\n| \u00b7  Capital goods 3                            | 1,315  | 614    | N/A    |\n| \u00b7  Fuel and energy related activities         | 56     | 55     | N/A    |\n| \u00b7  Upstream transportation and distribution   | 113    | 123    | N/A    |\n| \u00b7  Waste generated in operations              | 6      | 5      | N/A    |\n| \u00b7  Business travel 1,3                        | 83     | 73     | N/A    |\n| \u00b7  Employee commuting                         | 43     | 35     | N/A    |\n| \u00b7  Downstream transportation and distribution | 52     | 37     | N/A    |\n| \u00b7  End-of-life treatment of sold products     | 3      | 3      | N/A    |\n| Total CO 2 e emissions                        | 3,831  | 2,510  | N/A    |\n\n1. Categories measured in CO 2 in comparison periods.  2. The calculation of scope 3 emissions is substantially based on estimations and therefore inherently uncertain.  3. 2022 figures have been restated by adding 222, 137 and 18 thousand tonnes, respectively.\n\nIn 2023, Novo Nordisk experienced increased production volumes, ramp-up activities and impact from adverse local weather conditions; however, due to energy-saving projects and renewable power initiatives, scope 1 and 2 emissions remained broadly unchanged from 2022. Scope 3 emissions increased by 55% due to substantial investments in production capacity and increase in supply chain activities to support company growth. The two categories Purchased goods and services and Capital goods account for 90% of the scope 3 emissions, and they account for 98% of the overall scope 3 emissions' increase.\n\n## ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\n## Scope 1 emissions\n\nScope 1 emissions comprise direct CO 2 e emissions from sources that are owned or controlled by the Novo Nordisk Group. CO 2 e emissions from production, office buildings and laboratories include consumption of fuel oil, propane, wood and natural gas.\n\nCO 2 e emissions from production sites additionally include emissions from leakage of refrigerants from cooling systems. Production sites report on refrigerant quantities when there is leakage of refrigerant over 1 kg. Associated CO 2 e emissions are calculated based on refrigerant quantities and their respective Global Warming Potential (GWP).\n\nCO 2 e emissions from company cars cover cars leased or owned by Novo Nordisk. Emissions are calculated by multiplying the CO 2 e emission factors from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) by the volumes of diesel and petrol used.\n\n## Scope 2 emissions\n\nScope 2 emissions comprise CO 2 e emissions from purchased electricity, heat and steam. Market-based emissions are calculated based on CO 2 e emission factors from the previous year. For a full overview of location-based emissions, please visit: www.cdp.net.\n\n## Scope 3 emissions\n\nNovo Nordisk has identified 9 categories, out of the 15 categories of scope 3 emissions defined by the GHG protocol, as relevant. The remaining 6 categories are not separately reported on as they are either not applicable to Novo Nordisk or emissions have been included in the other emission categories.\n\n## Purchased goods and services\n\nPurchased goods and services include emissions related to all spend from external suppliers, except for investment spend and travel categories, which are included in other scope 3 categories. Purchased goods and services mainly comprise of raw materials for products, marketing, packaging materials, as well as consumables for laboratory and IT office equipment. Direct spend is converted into CO 2 e emissions using the average data method. Material weights are matched with CO 2 e factors depending on data availability. A spend-based factor is applied for direct spend data where no weight can be obtained. Indirect spend is converted into CO 2 e using a spend-based method.\n\n## Capital goods\n\nCapital goods include emissions related to all indirect investment spend from external suppliers, mainly production utilities and equipment. Indirect spend is converted into CO 2 e emissions via the average spend-based method using emission factors.",

        "page_content": "## Fuel and energy related activities\n\nFuel and energy related activities include all upstream CO 2 e emissions of purchased fuels and energy (beyond scope 1 and 2 emissions). Energy consumption is converted from GJ to kWh and multiplied by DEFRA's country-specific emission factors to assess CO 2 e tonnes. The category comprises upstream emissions from electricity, steam and heat; upstream emissions from transportation and distribution of electricity, steam and heat and emissions from upstream fuel.\n\n## Upstream transportation and distribution\n\nCO 2 e emissions from upstream transportation and distribution are calculated by an external supplier managing the transportation and distribution processes on behalf of Novo Nordisk, and using the industry standard EcoTransit solution. CO 2 e emissions are calculated based on the worldwide distribution of semi-finished and finished products, raw materials and components by air, sea and road between production sites and from production sites to subsidiaries, direct customers and importing distributors.\n\n## Waste generated in operations\n\nWaste generated in own operations includes CO 2 e emissions associated with third-party disposal and treatment of waste generated from production sites, offices and laboratories. Currently, waste data is available for production sites and offices, as well as laboratories within Denmark. Waste data is not available for offices and laboratories outside of Denmark, for which CO 2 e emissions are therefore extrapolated using the waste-type-specific method.\n\n## Business travel\n\nBusiness travel includes CO 2 e emissions from business flights and other travel, such as hotel stays and taxis. CO 2 e emissions from business flights are estimated based on mileage and passenger class details obtained from travel agencies. These are multiplied by CO 2 e emission factors for short-, medium- and long-haul flights. EPA emission factors are used to perform the calculations. Currently, 90% of emissions from flights are calculated based on data provided by travel agencies and the remaining 10% are extrapolated based on travel spend. CO 2 e emissions from other travel-related activities are calculated using a spend-based approach.\n\n## Employee commuting\n\nEmployee commuting includes CO 2 e emissions associated with commuting by all employees except those with company cars, since these emissions are reported as scope 1 emissions. CO 2 e emissions are estimated using the average data method and based on assumptions for the top six countries (Denmark, USA, India, China, France and Brazil) in terms of number of employees, which account for 85% of the employee base. Average distance and mode of transportation are used to calculate the CO 2 e emissions for the remaining 15% of employees.\n\n## Downstream transportation and distribution\n\nDownstream transportation and distribution include CO 2 e emissions that occur from transportation and distribution of sold products in vehicles and to facilities not owned or controlled by Novo Nordisk. Only transportation emissions are included in the calculations, specifically from the first receiving warehouse to pharmacies, hospitals and wholesalers. A simulation-based approach is applied to calculate downstream emissions, using a distance-based method by simulating route networks for four countries (Denmark, UK, Switzerland and Brazil). Transportation work (tonne-km) and CO 2 e emissions are estimated by calculating the distance travelled for the weight of distributed products and cool boxes. Moreover, the modelled route networks provide the basis for simulating US and China transportation and distribution. Transportation work per net kg product from the six reference countries (Denmark, UK, Switzerland, Brazil, China and US) is extrapolated to the remaining countries. Emissions per country are calculated based on i) the weight of sold products, ii) reference country transportation work and iii) the emission factor for the region and mode of transportation.\n\n## End-of-life treatment of sold products\n\nEnd-of-life treatment of sold products includes CO 2 e emissions from end-of-life treatment of all products sold to the market, including packaging. The amount of sold products is calculated from the realised sales data for specific devices and markets. It is assumed that devices are discarded in the markets where they are sold and that the end-of-life treatment follows the general treatment of the household waste for each market. Scenarios have been developed for end-of-life treatment for various Novo Nordisk products (FlexPen \u00ae , FlexTouch \u00ae , NovoFine \u00ae needle etc.). The scenarios cover the US, EU and Japan. The remaining CO 2 e emissions from other products are extrapolated by unit sales based on average end-of-life emissions from the products.\n\n## 7.3 Water consumption for production sites\n\nIn 2023, production sites consumed 4,150 thousand cubic metres of water; an increase of 6% compared to 2022 due to higher production volumes and ramp up activities for capacity expansion at production sites. Other contributing factors were warmer months in 2023, hence additional water was used for cooling purposes. Additionally, a higher number of employees led to increased on-site activities and extra shifts.\n\nProduction sites in France, Brazil, China, US, Iran and Algeria are located in areas of high water stress or with high seasonal variations (please refer to the CDP Water Security 2023 Reporting Guidance). These sites consume 18% of the total water for global production. Despite a significant increase in production volumes, water consumption at these facilities was kept at a 2% increase as the implementation of water conservation projects in water-stressed areas led to savings of 14 thousand cubic metres of water.\n\n## ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\nWater consumption is measured in thousand cubic metres of water and is based on metre readings and invoices. It includes drinking water, industrial water and steam water used at production sites.\n\n## 7.4 Waste from production sites\n\n| Tonnes                                 | 2023    | 2022    | 2021    |\n|----------------------------------------|---------|---------|---------|\n| Organic residues                       | 128,116 | 166,183 | 143,254 |\n| Other (paper, cardboard, metals, etc.) | 19,019  | 12,820  | 7,990   |\n| Total recycling                        | 147,135 | 179,003 | 151,244 |\n| Ethanol waste                          | 12,521  | 14,913  | 13,232  |\n| Other (various combustible waste)      | 9,390   | 8,007   | 8,239   |\n| Total waste with energy recovery       | 21,911  | 22,920  | 21,471  |\n| Water waste with no energy recovery    | 141     | 356     | 5,499   |\n| Other                                  | 1,987   | 827     | 1,660   |\n| Total waste with no energy recovery    | 2,128   | 1,183   | 7,159   |\n| Water waste with resource recovery     | 7,949   | 7,379   | N/A     |\n| Other                                  | 9,330   | 2,114   | N/A     |\n| Total waste with resource recovery     | 17,279  | 9,493   | N/A     |\n| Total waste to landfill                | 638     | 906     | 932     |\n| Total waste                            | 189,091 | 213,505 | 180,806 |\n\nIn 2023, waste from production sites decreased by 11% compared to 2022 due to waste reduction initiatives, reuse of waste and implementation of zero landfill waste strategies.\n\nThe amount of waste recycled decreased by 18%, primarily due to initiatives to avoid waste and efforts to transition from recycling to resource recovery.\n\nThe amount of waste sent for energy recovery decreased by 4%, primarily due to optimisation projects and changes in the composition of waste, which led to a decrease in the amount of waste being sent to incineration. Less than 0.3% of the total waste was sent to landfill. In 2023, 20% of the waste was categorised as hazardous waste.",

Organic residues for recycling are waste from the production of the active pharmaceutical ingredients, where the energy is recovered in biogas plants and the digested slurry is used on local farmland as fertiliser. Ethanol is recovered in internal regeneration plants and re-used. Energy recovery is waste disposed of at waste-to-energy plants and at a biogas plant. Waste with no energy recovery covers water waste and other waste not suitable for other disposal methods, such as hazardous waste for incineration and various other types of waste.\n\n## 7.5 Breaches of environmental regulatory limit values\n\nIn 2023 there were 12 breaches compared to 8 in 2022. None of the breaches resulted in any correlated material negative impact on the environment. For all breaches, mitigation actions are in progress.\n\n## ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\nBreaches of regulatory limit values cover all breaches with limit values reported to the environmental authorities. Breaches related to the same continued exceedance at the same site count as one breach for the year.\n\n## Section 8 Social performance\n\n## 8.1 Patients reached with Novo Nordisk's Diabetes and Obesity care products\n\n| Estimate in millions                                         |   2023 |   2022 |   2021 |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Patients reached with Novo Nordisk's  Diabetes care products |   40.5 |   36.3 |   34.6 |\n| Patients reached with Novo Nordisk's  Obesity care products  |    1.1 |    0.6 |    0.3 |\n| Total number of patients reached                             |   41.6 |   36.9 |   34.9 |\n\nThe estimated number of full-year patients reached with Novo Nordisk's Diabetes care products increased from 36.3 million in 2022 to 40.5 million in 2023. The 12% increase was primarily driven by the GLP-1 franchise, followed by the new-generation insulin franchise and the human insulin franchise. The increase in number of full-year patients reached with Novo Nordisk's Obesity care products in 2023 was primarily driven by the continued launch of Wegovy \u00ae in new markets.\n\nIn 2023, the estimated number of full-year patients with diabetes reached with Novo Nordisk's human insulin vials through the Access to Insulin Commitment was 2.4 million, compared to 1.8 million in 2022. The 33% growth through the Access to Insulin Commitment was driven by increased sales through both government and private market channels, sold at or below the USD 3 ceiling price. Novo Nordisk also sold human insulin vials at or below the ceiling price of USD 3 in countries outside the Commitment, reaching an estimated additional 2.6 million patients in 2023. This represents a total of 5 million patients with diabetes reached with human insulin at or below USD 3 per vial globally.\n\nThrough the Changing Diabetes \u00ae in Children (CDIC) partnership, 52,249 children and youth were reached in total by the end of 2023, compared to 41,033 by the end of 2022. Almost half of the new enrolled children were reached through expansion in Asian countries, mainly India, Pakistan, Indonesia and Vietnam. The children receive access to diabetes care in clinics (e.g. patient education), as well as medical supplies if needed.\n\n## ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\nThe number of full-year patients reached with Novo Nordisk's Diabetes and Obesity care products, excluding devices, is estimated by dividing Novo Nordisk's annual sales volume by the annual usage dose per patient for each product class, as defined by the WHO (for Diabetes) and in accordance with the dose strength of the product (for Obesity).\n\nThe number of full-year patients reached with human insulin vials via the Novo Nordisk Access to Insulin Commitment is estimated by dividing Novo Nordisk's annual sales volume by the annual usage dose per patient reached via the Novo Nordisk Access to Insulin Commitment, as defined by the WHO. The WHO-defined daily dosage for these products may not accurately reflect the recommended or prescribed daily dose. Actual doses are based on individual characteristics (e.g. age and weight) and pharmacokinetic considerations. Despite this uncertainty, Novo Nordisk assesses this to be the most consistent way of reporting.\n\nThe number of children reached with Diabetes care treatment through the Changing Diabetes \u00ae in Children programme is measured as the total accumulated number of children enrolled since the initiation of the partnership in 2009.\n\n## 8.2 Employees\n\n## Number of employees\n\n| Number                                 | 2023   | 2022   | 2021   |\n|----------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Year-end employees (total)             | 64,319 | 55,185 | 48,478 |\n| Year-end number of full-time employees | 63,370 | 54,393 | 47,792 |\n\n## Employees by geographical area\n\n| Number                                                        | 2023   | 2022   | 2021   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| International Operations                                      | 56,004 | 47,935 | 42,372 |\n| Denmark                                                       | 28,692 | 22,916 | 19,150 |\n| EMEA (Europe, the Middle East and Africa),  excluding Denmark | 8,808  | 7,954  | 7,530  |\n| China (Mainland China, Hong Kong, Taiwan)                     | 6,485  | 6,148  | 5,833  |\n| Rest of World (all other countries)                           | 12,019 | 10,917 | 9,859  |\n| North America Operations                                      | 8,315  | 7,250  | 6,106  |\n| Year-end employees (total)                                    | 64,319 | 55,185 | 48,478 |",

Currently, Novo Nordisk's HR systems allow employees to select the gender they most identify with. Moving forward, Novo Nordisk is committed to increasing awareness of this self-identification option. The breakdown by age group remained stable in the last three years.\n\nThe employee turnover rate decreased from 8.2% in 2022 to 5.5% in 2023, with decline in almost all business areas.\n\n## ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\nThe total number of employees is measured as headcount of all employees at year-end, except externals, employees on unpaid leave, interns, Bachelor's and Master's thesis employees and substitutes. All employee data is based on registrations in Novo Nordisk's HR systems.\n\nEmployees are attributed to geographical regions according to their primary workplace across the commercial units, research and development, production and support functions. Employees in corporate functions are included in EMEA and employees in Global Business Services in Bangalore, India, are included in Rest of World.\n\nThe employee turnover rate is measured as the number of employees, excluding temporary employees, who left the Group during the financial year, divided by the average number of employees, excluding temporary employees. Employees working for Group companies that have been disposed of are not counted as having left the Group.\n\n## 8.3 Gender diversity in leadership positions\n\n| Ratio men:women                          | 2023   | 2022   | 2021   |\n|------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| CEO, EVP, SVP                            | 64:36  | 71:29  | 72:28  |\n| CVP, VP                                  | 59:41  | 60:40  | 63:37  |\n| Director, manager, team leader           | 54:46  | 55:45  | 57:43  |\n| Gender in leadership positions (overall) | 54:46  | 56:44  | 57:43  |\n| Gender in senior leadership positions    | 59:41  | 61:39  | 64:36  |\n| Gender in the Board of Directors         | 50:50  | 54:46  | 67:33  |\n\nThe gender diversity in leadership positions overall at Novo Nordisk meets the Danish gender diversity requirements. At the end of 2023, 46% of leadership positions were filled by women, compared to 44% at the end of 2022. Within senior leadership, 41% positions were filled by women at the end of 2023, compared to 39% at the end of 2022.\n\nAll management teams, from entry level upwards, are encouraged to focus on enhanced diversity, with the aim of ensuring a robust pipeline of talent for leadership positions. In 2021, Novo Nordisk introduced a global aspirational target of achieving a balanced gender representation across all managerial levels with a minimum of 45% for both women and men in senior leadership positions by the end of 2025.\n\n## ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\nGender in leadership positions is reported as the percentage split by gender in leadership and senior leadership positions. Senior leadership positions are defined as employees in the global job levels chief executive officer (CEO), executive vice president (EVP), senior vice president (SVP), corporate vice president (CVP) and vice president (VP). Overall leadership positions are defined as directors, managers, team leaders and senior leadership positions. Diversity on the Board of Directors is reported as the percentage split by gender among all members, including employeeelected members.\n\n## 8.4 Sustainable employer score\n\nThis year's employee survey revealed an increase in the already high overall engagement, bringing it to 86% favourable compared to 85% favourable in 2022. Novo Nordisk continues to score in the top quartile when benchmarked against external organisations when it comes to providing a purpose-driven workplace. Improvements were seen on most questions, with a large improvement on 'I understand how my performance is evaluated', which was a focus area for follow up on the 2022 survey results. Opportunities for further improvement were seen in providing equal career opportunities for all and improving following through on committed actions, based on survey results across the organisation.\n\n## ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\nThe Sustainable employer score measures the average percentage of favourable answers to the 18 engagement items in the survey. Favourable answers are defined as 'Agree' and 'Strongly agree' to positively framed questions. The survey is administered by an external vendor.\n\n## 8.5 Health and safety\n\nIn 2023, Novo Nordisk had 153 accidents with reported absence compared to 128 in 2022, which is in line with the increase in number of employees. The average lost time accident frequency was 1.5 in 2023, in line with 2022.\n\nNovo Nordisk had one work-related fatality in 2023 compared to two in 2022, due to a car accident. Novo Nordisk will continue to train and motivate employees on good road safety behaviour to reduce the risk of recurrences.\n\nIn 2023, Novo Nordisk has harmonised incident reporting into one global reporting system to ensure standardised reporting and systematic prevention, specifically with focus on prevention of high-risk incidents.\n\nWe offer a healthy and engaging workplace, supported by a comprehensive health and safety programme based on continuous improvements within safety, physical health, mental well-being and employee health promotion. To this end, we have implemented our Health & Safety management system across our entire global organisation. Performance is overseen by Executive management and the Board of Directors. In 2023, 13.8% of Novo Nordisk employees reported symptoms of stress, in line with 2022, and 7.1% reported symptoms of work-related physical pain, compared to 7.8% in 2022.\n\nFor a full overview of Novo Nordisk's Health and safety framework and for the CEO's statement on health and safety, please refer to: www.novonordisk.com/sustainablebusiness/esg-portal/social.html.",

Contractors, visitors, employees on unpaid leave, interns and Bachelor's and Master's thesis students are not included. An occupational accident with absence is any work-related accident causing at least one day of absence in addition to the day of the accident.\n\nThe percentages of employees reporting symptoms of stress and employees reporting symptoms of work-related physical pain are monitored in the annual employee survey. In the survey, stress is defined as a situation where the employee feels tense, restless, nervous or troubled, or unable to sleep at night due to thoughts about their problems. With reference to symptoms of physical pain, the employee is asked in the survey if generally their work causes them physical pain.\n\n## 8.6 US pricing\n\n| % change vs prior year   | 2023    | 2022    | 2021    |\n|--------------------------|---------|---------|---------|\n| US product portfolio     |         |         |         |\n| List price change - Avg. | 2.8%    | 2.4%    | 1.6%    |\n| Net price change - Avg.  | (8.2%)  | (10.5%) | (12.3%) |\n| US insulin portfolio     |         |         |         |\n| List price change - Avg. | 0.1%    | 0.0%    | 0.0%    |\n| Net price change - Avg.  | (24.4%) | (19.5%) | (10.9%) |\n\nNovo Nordisk has a long history of making products accessible and affordable through responsible pricing practices and patient access programmes. In 2023, the average net price of both the US product portfolio and the US insulin portfolio decreased by 8.2% and 24.4%, respectively, compared to 10.5% and 19.5% in 2022, as a result of enhancements to secure formulary access for insured patients, as well as the evolution of channel and payer mix.\n\nNovo Nordisk has provided sales discounts and rebates amounting to 74% of US gross sales in 2023, resulting in the average annual list price across US product portfolio increasing by 2.8% and the US insulin portfolio by 0.1%.\n\n## ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\nThe US product portfolio is inclusive of Diabetes, Obesity and Rare Disease products. The percentage change represents a sales weighted average list and net price for the respective year compared to the sales weighted average list and net price for the prior year, and is not reflective of the magnitude of individual list price actions. The net price represents the average list price minus rebates, discounts and returns for the specific product for the year in which it is being calculated.\n\n## 8.7 Total tax contribution\n\n| DKK million                  | Taxes  borne   | Taxes  collected   | 2023   | 2022   | 2021   |\n|------------------------------|----------------|--------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Corporate income taxes  paid | 25,897         | 6,080              | 31,977 | 19,097 | 18,390 |\n| Employment taxes             | 2,666          | 13,510             | 16,176 | 13,006 | 10,840 |\n| Indirect taxes               | 2,815          | (1,035)            | 1,780  | 3,027  | 2,612  |\n| Other taxes                  | 1,314          | -                  | 1,314  | 873    | 751    |\n| Total                        | 32,692         | 18,555             | 51,247 | 36,003 | 32,593 |\n\nIn 2023, the total tax contribution amounted to DKK 51,247 million, split across 64% of taxes borne and 36% of taxes collected. In 2022, the split was 55% of taxes borne and 45% of taxes collected.\n\nThe overall increase in total tax contribution from 2022 to 2023 is primarily related to higher corporate income taxes paid in Denmark due to an increase in the profit before tax. In addition, the corporate income tax in 2022 reflects the partial refund of tax prepayment made in 2021. Expansion of production and sales worldwide have required more employees which has increased the payment of employment taxes including social security contributions.\n\n## ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\nNovo Nordisk's total tax contribution is measured as the taxes borne or collected by Novo Nordisk, which have been paid in the respective year. Taxes borne are defined as taxes where Novo Nordisk carries the cost. Taxes collected are defined as taxes collected by Novo Nordisk on behalf of others, e.g. employee income taxes deducted from employee salaries and paid to the government.\n\nCorporate income taxes paid primarily consist of corporate income taxes and withholding taxes on company dividends paid during the year.\n\nEmployment taxes primarily consist of taxes collected from employees on behalf of the government and social security costs (part of payroll taxes in some countries).\n\nIndirect taxes consist of non-refundable VAT, net VAT collections, customs duties, environmental taxes and property taxes.\n\nOther taxes consist of country-specific taxes not linked to one of the categories above, e.g. the US branded prescription drug fee.\n\n## 8.8 Donations and other contributions\n\n| DKK million                                 |   2023 |   2022 | 2021   |\n|---------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| World Diabetes Foundation (WDF)             |    119 |     93 | 92     |\n| Novo Nordisk Haemophilia Foundation  (NNHF) |     19 |     33 | -      |\n| Total donations and other contributions     |    138 |    126 | 92     |\n\nThe WDF, an independent trust, supports sustainable partnerships and acts as a catalyst to help others do more.

In 2023, 99% of employees completed and documented their training, in line with 2022. The completion and documentation rate represents the emphasis of Novo Nordisk diligently following up on employees to ensure completion of the annual training. The remaining 1% is mainly due to employees being on leave.\n\n## ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\nThe number of business ethics reviews is recorded as the number of business ethics reviews performed by Group Internal Audit in subsidiaries, production sites, vendors and headquarter areas.\n\nThe mandatory ethics and compliance training is based on the principles for ethics and compliance for employees working at Novo Nordisk. The training is provided in the form of globally applicable e-learning and related tests. The percentage of employees trained in business ethics is calculated as the number of employees that have completed the training divided by the total number of employees at year-end.\n\n## 9.2 Compliance Hotline\n\nWe maintain a Compliance Hotline to enable employees, stakeholders and external parties to report potential violations of our policies or applicable laws and regulations. The Compliance Hotline is an important component of our commitment to ethical conduct and transparency. The increase in number of substantiated cases in the period from 2021 to 2023 is driven by the increased business growth, including development in number of employees.\n\n## ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\nNumber of substantiated cases reported via the Compliance Hotline includes the number of cases where reported allegations of suspected misconduct have been substantiated or partially substantiated. When a case has been substantiated or partially substantiated, corrective actions are initiated.\n\nConvictions for violation of anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws include convictions where a Novo Nordisk legal entity (parent or any affiliate) has been found in violation by a court of law.\n\n## 9.3 Supplier audits\n\n| Number                      |   2023 |   2022 |   2021 |\n|-----------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Responsible sourcing audits |     24 |     14 |     16 |\n| Quality audits              |    358 |    280 |    237 |\n| Total supplier audits       |    382 |    294 |    253 |\n\nThe 30% increase in the number of supplier audits from 2022 to 2023 reflects the general increased activity level in Novo Nordisk. Two critical findings on responsible sourcing were issued during 2023, both related to wages, benefits and working hours. Three critical findings were issued during quality audits, related to reprocessing, certificates of analysis (COAs) and cross-contamination control. Agreements regarding actions to address all critical findings have been made with the affected suppliers. Of the two critical findings issued and reported in 2022, one was addressed in the same year, and remediation for the second critical finding regarding environmental reporting was still ongoing. An agreement with the supplier has subsequently been reached during 2023.\n\n## ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\nThe number of supplier audits concluded by Novo Nordisk's Corporate Quality function consists of the number of responsible sourcing audits and quality audits conducted at suppliers.\n\n## 9.4 Product recalls\n\nIn 2023, Novo Nordisk had two product recalls. In Libya, the recall was due to a labelling error on the sales carton. In Spain, the recall was due to cracked cartridges in FlexTouch \u00ae pens.\n\n## ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\nThe number of product recalls is recorded as the number of times Novo Nordisk has instituted a recall, and includes recalls in connection with clinical trials. A recall can affect various countries.\n\n## 9.5 Failed inspections\n\nIn 2023, Novo Nordisk had not failed any inspection among those that were resolved at year-end. During 2023, 152 inspections were conducted. At year-end, 117 inspections were passed and 35 were unresolved, as final inspection reports had not been received, or the final authority's acceptance was pending. This is normal practice. Follow-up on unresolved inspections will continue in 2024.\n\n## ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\nFailed inspections are defined as inspections where Warning Letters or EMA noncompliance letters related to GMP inspections are received, GMP/ISO certificates for strategic sites are lost, pre-approval inspections result in a Complete Response Letter, study conclusions are changed due to GCP/GLP inspection issues, or marketing or import authorisations are withdrawn due to inspection issues. Strategic sites are defined as the manufacturing sites in Brazil, China, Denmark, France and the US. Acquired companies inspections are defined as inspections run by the acquired company. Inspections at acquired companies run by Novo Nordisk are reported as Novo Nordisk inspections.",

In addition, feedback on those units was collected from approximately 550 stakeholders. Out of the 42 units, one unit was assessed not to be working in accordance with the Novo Nordisk Way, and for five units immediate actions were required, which if not taken would lead to breaches of the Novo Nordisk Way.\n\nAcross all units facilitated, the accelerated growth and supply-demand challenges are the two main factors which consistently impact the organisation and drive most improvement opportunities from the facilitations conducted. The most frequent observations raised to management teams for action are associated with five out of our ten Essentials: 2) We set ambitious goals and are empowered to achieve them, 5) We build and maintain good relations with our stakeholders, 7) We focus on performance and personal development, 8) We have a healthy and engaging work environment, and 9) We strive for agility and simplicity in everything we do.\n\n## ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\nFacilitations of the Novo Nordisk Way are measured as the number of facilitations completed. A facilitation is an internal process for assessing adherence to the Novo Nordisk Way. The assessments are based on a review of documentation and feedback from stakeholders, followed by an on-site visit during which randomly selected employees and management are interviewed. Identified gaps and improvement opportunities related to the Novo Nordisk Way are presented to, and discussed with, Management. The facilitators and Management agree on an action plan to address those gaps and improvement opportunities. For the full list of the Novo Nordisk Way Essentials, please refer to page 19 in the Management review.\n\n## 9.7 Company reputation\n\n## 9.8 Animals purchased for research\n\n| Scale 0-100             |   2023 |   2022 |   2021 |\n|-------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| People with diabetes    |   81.4 |   81.3 |   81.5 |\n| People with obesity     |   77.9 |   79.4 |   79.4 |\n| General practitioners   |   82.9 |   84   |   84.8 |\n| Diabetes specialists    |   88.9 |   90.3 |   90.3 |\n| Informed general public |   79.6 |   76.3 |   77.1 |\n| Total score (average)   |   82.1 |   82.3 |   82.6 |\n\nCompany reputation is a comprehensive approach to analysing reputational intelligence. Novo Nordisk's excellent reputation score is driven by positive perceptions of products and services, and by growing appreciation from the informed general public.\n\n## ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\nThe reputation score is based on four factors measuring esteem, admiration, trust and feeling of the stakeholders towards Novo Nordisk, across ten key markets: France, Denmark, the US, Canada, Brazil, China, Japan, Germany, Italy and the UK. The data is collected through online surveys carried out by an external consultancy firm. Responses are aggregated to produce an overall score on a Likert scale of 1-7, which is rebased on a 0-100 scale.\n\n| Number                       | 2023   | 2022   | 2021   |\n|------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Mice, rats and other rodents | 54,410 | 63,760 | 35,675 |\n| Pigs                         | 608    | 427    | 759    |\n| Rabbits                      | 289    | 606    | 184    |\n| Dogs                         | 356    | 146    | 114    |\n| Non-human primates           | 807    | 700    | 495    |\n| Fish                         | 36     | 14,098 | 10,638 |\n| Other vertebrates            | 2      | 13     | 14     |\n| Total animals purchased      | 56,508 | 79,750 | 47,879 |\n\nThe number of animals purchased for research in 2023 decreased by 29% compared to 2022. 96% of the animals purchased were rodents. The significant decrease in the number of fish and rodents in 2023 is attributable, respectively, to specific research projects using fish larvae that have been discontinued in the year, and to our continuous efforts to reduce the number of animals used for research.\n\n## ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\nAnimals purchased for research comprises the number of animals purchased for all research undertaken by Novo Nordisk either in-house or by external contractors.

The consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with IFRS Accounting Standards as endorsed by the EU and additional requirements of the Danish Financial Statements Act, and the parent financial statements are prepared in accordance with the Danish Financial Statements Act.\n\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the Group's financial position at 31 December 2023, and of the results of its operations and cash flows for the financial year 1 January 2023 - 31 December 2023 in accordance with IFRS Accounting Standards as endorsed by the EU and additional requirements under the Danish Financial Statements Act.\n\nFurther, in our opinion, the parent financial statements give a true and fair view of the Parent's financial position at 31 December 2023, and of the results of its operations for the financial year 1 January 2023 - 31 December 2023 in accordance with the Danish Financial Statements Act.\n\nOur opinion is consistent with our Long-form Auditor's report issued to the Audit Committee and the Board of Directors.\n\n## Basis for opinion\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISAs) and the additional requirements applicable in Denmark. Our responsibilities under those standards and requirements are further described in the Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated financial statements and the parent financial statements section of this auditor's report. We are independent of the Group in accordance with the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants' International Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (IESBA Code) and the additional ethical requirements applicable in Denmark, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the IESBA Code. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\nTo the best of our knowledge and belief, we have not provided any prohibited non-audit services as referred to in Article 5(1) of Regulation (EU) No 537/2014.\n\nWe were appointed auditors of Novo Nordisk A/S for the first time on 25 March 2021, for the financial year 2021. We have been reappointed annually by decision of the general meeting for a total continuous engagement period of three years up to and including the financial year 2023.\n\n## Key audit matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements and the parent financial statements for the financial year 1 January 2023 - 31 December 2023. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements and the parent financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n## Key audit matter\n\n## How our audit addressed the key audit matter\n\nUS sales rebates\n\nRefer to notes 2.1 and 3.5 in the consolidated financial statements.\n\nIn the United States (US), sales rebates are paid in connection with public healthcare insurance programmes, namely Medicare and Medicaid, as well as rebates to pharmacy benefit managers and managed healthcare plans. In January 2021, the Group changed its policy in the US related to the 340B Drug Pricing Program, whereby Novo Nordisk no longer provides 340B statutory discounts to certain pharmacies that contract with covered entities participating in the 340B Drug Pricing Program. Novo Nordisk has only recognised revenue related to the 340B Drug Pricing Program to the extent that it is highly probable that its inclusion will not result in a significant revenue reversal in the future. When sales are recognised, Novo Nordisk also records provisions for the expected value of the sales deductions (variable consideration) at the time the related sales are recorded.\n\nThe US sales rebates, including provisions related to the 340B Drug Pricing Program, involved significant measurement uncertainty as the provisions are based on legal interpretations of applicable laws and regulations, historical claims experience, payer channel mix, current contract prices, unbilled claims, claims submission time lags and inventory levels in the distribution channel. Consequently, we considered this to be a key audit matter.\n\nWe evaluated the appropriateness of the methodology used to develop sales rebates provisions, including provisions related to the 340B Drug Pricing Program, by involving audit professionals with industry and quantitative analytics experience to assist us in performing our auditing procedures.\n\nWe tested the effectiveness of controls relating to sales rebates, including controls over the assumptions and data used to estimate these rebates.\n\nWe tested rebate claims processed, including evaluating those claims for consistency with the conditions and terms of rebate arrangements.\n\nWe tested the overall reasonableness of the accruals recorded at period end by developing an expectation for comparison to actual recorded balances.\n\nWe evaluated Management's ability to estimate sales rebates accurately by considering the historical accuracy of the estimates in prior year.",

We did not identify any material misstatement of the management review.\n\n## Management's responsibilities for the Financial Statements\n\nManagement is responsible for the preparation of consolidated financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with IFRS Accounting Standards as endorsed by the EU and additional requirements of the Danish Financial Statements Act as well as the preparation of parent financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with the Danish Financial Statements Act, and for such internal control as Management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements and parent financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the consolidated financial statements and the parent financial statements, Management is responsible for assessing the Group's and the Parent's ability to continue as a going concern, for disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern, and for using the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the consolidated financial statements and the parent financial statements unless Management either intends to liquidate the Group or the Entity or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\n## Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the Financial Statements\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements and the parent financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs and the additional requirements applicable in Denmark will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements and these parent financial statements.\n\nAs part of an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs and the additional requirements applicable in Denmark, we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n\n- \u00b7  Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements and the parent financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations or the override of internal control.\n- \u00b7  Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group's and the Parent's internal control.\n- \u00b7  Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by Management.\n- \u00b7  Conclude on the appropriateness of Management's use of the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the consolidated financial statements and the parent financial statements, and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group's and the Parent's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements and the parent financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group and the Entity to cease to continue as a going concern.\n- \u00b7  Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the Financial Statements, including the disclosures in the notes, and whether the Financial Statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that gives a true and fair view.\n- \u00b7  Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.\n\nWe communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.\n\nWe also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and, where applicable, safeguards put in place and measures taken to eliminate threats.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the Financial Statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\n\n## Report on compliance with the ESEF Regulation\n\nAs part of our audit of the Financial Statements of Novo Nordisk A/S, we performed procedures to express an opinion on whether the annual report of Novo Nordisk A/S for the financial year 1 January 2023 to 31 December 2023 with the file name NOVO-2023-12-31-en.zip is prepared, in all material respects, in compliance with the Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/815 on the European Single Electronic Format (ESEF Regulation), which includes requirements\n\nrelated to the preparation of the annual report in XHTML format and iXBRL tagging of the consolidated financial statements including notes.\n\nManagement is responsible for preparing an annual report that complies with the ESEF Regulation. This responsibility includes:\n\n- \u00b7  The preparing of the annual report in XHTML format;\n- \u00b7  The selection and application of appropriate iXBRL tags, including extensions to the ESEF taxonomy and the anchoring thereof to elements in the taxonomy, for financial information required to be tagged using judgement where necessary;\n- \u00b7  Ensuring consistency between iXBRL tagged data and the consolidated financial statements presented in human readable format; and\n- \u00b7  For such internal control as Management determines necessary to enable the preparation of an annual report that is compliant with the ESEF Regulation.\n\nOur responsibility is to obtain reasonable assurance on whether the annual report is prepared, in all material respects, in compliance with the ESEF Regulation based on the evidence we have obtained and to issue a report that includes our opinion. The nature, timing and extent of procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material departures from the requirements set out in the ESEF Regulation, whether due to fraud or error. The procedures include:\n\n- \u00b7  Testing whether the annual report is prepared in XHTML format;\n- \u00b7  Obtaining an understanding of the Company's iXBRL tagging process and of internal control over the tagging process;\n- \u00b7  Evaluating the completeness of the iXBRL tagging of the consolidated financial statements including notes;\n- \u00b7  Evaluating the appropriateness of the Company's use of iXBRL elements selected from the ESEF taxonomy and the creation of extension elements where no suitable element in the ESEF taxonomy has been identified;\n- \u00b7  Evaluating the use of anchoring of extension elements to elements in the ESEF taxonomy; and\n- \u00b7  Reconciling the iXBRL tagged data with the audited consolidated financial statements.\n\nIn our opinion, the annual report of Novo Nordisk A/S for the financial year 1 January to 31 December 2023 with the file name NOVO-2023-12-31-en.zip is prepared, in all material respects, in compliance with the ESEF Regulation.\n\nCopenhagen, 31 January 2024\n\n## Deloitte\n\nStatsautoriseret Revisionspartnerselskab Business Registration No 33 96 35 56\n\nAnders Vad Dons State-Authorised Public Accountant mne25299",

Furthermore, Management is responsible for establishing objective accounting policies for the preparation of the ESG statement, for the overall content of the ESG statement, and for measuring and reporting ESG data in accordance with the Basis of preparation and the ESG accounting policies.\n\n## Auditor's responsibility\n\nOur responsibility is to express a limited assurance conclusion based on our engagement with Management and in accordance with the agreed scope of work. We have conducted our work in accordance with ISAE 3000 (Revised) Assurance Engagements Other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information and ISAE 3410 Assurance Engagements on Greenhouse Gas Statements, and additional requirements under Danish audit regulation, to obtain limited assurance about our conclusion. Greenhouse Gas emissions quantification is subject to inherent uncertainty because of incomplete scientific knowledge used to determine emission factors and the values needed to combine emissions of different gasses.\n\n## We are responsible for:\n\n- \u00b7 planning and performing the engagement to obtain limited assurance about whether the ESG statement is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the Basis for preparation and the ESG accounting policies;\n- \u00b7 forming an independent conclusion, based on the procedures we performed and the evidence we obtained; and\n- \u00b7 reporting our conclusion to the stakeholders of Novo Nordisk A/S.\n\nDeloitte Statsautoriseret Revisionspartnerselskab applies International Standard on Quality Management 1 (ISQM 1), which requires the firm to design, implement and operate a system of quality management including policies or procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards and applicable legal and regulatory requirements. We have complied with the requirements for independence and other ethical requirements of the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants' International Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (IESBA Code), which is founded on fundamental principles of integrity, objectivity, professional competence and due care, confidentiality and professional behaviour and ethical requirements applicable in Denmark.\n\nA limited assurance engagement is substantially less in scope than a reasonable assurance engagement. Consequently, the level of assurance obtained in a limited assurance engagement is substantially lower than the assurance that would have been obtained had we performed a reasonable assurance engagement.\n\n## Work performed\n\nWe are required to plan and perform our work in order to consider the risk of material misstatement in the ESG statement. To do so, we have:\n\n- \u00b7 conducted interviews with data owners and internal stakeholders to understand the key processes and control activities for measuring, recording and reporting the ESG data;\n- \u00b7 performed limited substantive testing on a selective basis to check that data has been appropriately measured, recorded, collated and reported;\n- \u00b7 performed analysis of data, selected based on risk and materiality;\n- \u00b7 made inquiries regarding significant developments in the reported data;\n- \u00b7 considered the presentation and disclosure of the ESG statement;\n- \u00b7 assessed that the process for reporting greenhouse gas emissions data follows the principles of relevance, completeness, consistency, transparency and accuracy outlined in The Greenhouse Gas Protocol Corporate Standard Revised edition (2015) and The Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting and Reporting Standard (2011); and\n- \u00b7 evaluated the evidence obtained.\n\n## Our conclusion\n\nBased on the procedures performed and the evidence obtained, nothing has come to our attention that causes us not to believe that the ESG data on pages 86 to 94 in the consolidated ESG statement for the period 1 January - 31 December 2023, have been prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the Basis of preparation and the ESG accounting policies.\n\nCopenhagen, 31 January 2024\n\n## Deloitte\n\nStatsautoriseret Revisionspartnerselskab Business Registration No. 33 96 35 56\n\nAnders Vad Dons State-Authorised Public Accountant mne25299\n\nMads St\u00e6rdahl Rosenfeldt ESG Partner",

        "page_content": "## Notes\n\n## 1 Accounting policies\n\nThe financial statements of the parent company have been prepared in accordance with the Danish Financial Statements Act (Class D) and other accounting regulations for companies listed on Nasdaq Copenhagen.\n\nThe accounting policies for the financial statements of the parent company are unchanged from the previous financial year. The accounting policies are the same as for the consolidated financial statements with the adjustments described below. For a description of the accounting policies of the Group, refer to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nNo separate statement of cash flows has been prepared for the parent company; refer to the statement of cash flows for the Group.\n\n## Supplementary accounting policies for the parent company\n\n## Intangible assets\n\nGoodwill recognised in subsidiaries is amortised over 23 years, which reflects the useful life of the underlying assets and activities generating the goodwill.\n\n## Financial assets\n\nIn the financial statements of the parent company, investments in subsidiaries and associated companies are recorded under the equity method, using the respective share of the net asset values in subsidiaries and associated companies. The equity method is used as a measurement method rather than a consolidation method.\n\nThe net profit of subsidiaries and associated companies less unrealised intra-group profits and amortisation of goodwill is recorded in the income statement of the parent company. To the extent that net profit exceeds declared dividends from such companies, the net revaluation of investments in subsidiaries and associated companies is transferred to net revaluation reserve under equity according to the equity method. Profits in subsidiaries and associated companies are disclosed as profit after tax.\n\nAmounts owed by affiliates, where settlement is neither planned nor likely within the foreseeable future, are treated as part of net-investments in subsidiaries, with exchange rate adjustments recognised directly in equity through reserve for cash flow hedges and exchange rate adjustments.\n\n## Tax\n\nFor Danish tax purposes, the parent company is assessed jointly with its Danish subsidiaries. The Danish jointly taxed companies are included in a Danish on-account tax payment scheme for Danish corporate income tax. All current taxes under the scheme are recorded in the individual companies. Novo Nordisk A/S and its jointly taxed subsidiaries are included in the joint taxation of the parent company, Novo Holdings A/S.\n\n## 2 Sales\n\n| DKK million                   | 2023    | 2022    |\n|-------------------------------|---------|---------|\n| Sales by business segment     |         |         |\n| Diabetes and Obesity care     | 197,969 | 142,413 |\n| Rare disease                  | 109     | 243     |\n| Total sales                   | 198,078 | 142,656 |\n| Sales by geographical segment |         |         |\n| North America Operations      | 124,860 | 79,953  |\n| International Operations:     |         |         |\n| EMEA                          | 40,038  | 32,789  |\n| China                         | 12,800  | 14,412  |\n| Rest of World                 | 20,380  | 15,502  |\n| Total sales                   | 198,078 | 142,656 |\n\nSales are attributed to a geographical segment based on location of the customer.
