Like the ascending peaks of a mountain range, we have grown every year - not only on the strength of our business performance, but equally and importantly, through our steadfast commitment to environmental, social and governance practices underpinned by a culture of transparency.\n\nThe Adani portfolio of companies, headquartered in Ahmedabad, India, has been founded and promoted by the visionary industrialist Mr Gautam Adani. The operations of the portfolio commenced in 1988 with commodity trading business under the flagship company Adani Enterprises Limited (previously Adani Exports Limited).\n\nThe Adani portfolio of companies today stands amongst India's largest and fastest-growing diversified business portfolios spanning transport, logistics, energy and utility, materials, metals, mining and various B2C sectors. The portfolio comprises eleven publicly-traded companies, including four investment grade (IG)-rated businesses, and is India's sole Infrastructure Investment Grade bond issuer.\n\n## Vision\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTo be a world-class leader in businesses that enrich lives and contribute to nations in building infrastructure through sustainable value creation.\n\n## Values\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Courage\n\nWe shall embrace new ideas and businesses\n\n## Trust\n\nWe shall believe in our employees and other stakeholders\n\n## Commitment\n\nWe shall stand by our promises and adhere to high standards of business\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Culture\n\n## Passion\n\nPerforming with enthusiasm and energy\n\n## Results\n\nConsistently achieving goals\n\n## Integration\n\nWorking across functions and businesses to create synergies\n\n## Dedication\n\nWorking with commitment in the pursuit of our aims\n\n## Entrepreneurship\n\nSeizing new opportunities with initiatives and ownership\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Adani portfolio of companies is guided by the philosophy of 'Growth with Goodness', which emphasises sustainable and responsible development aligned with national priorities. To this end, ambitious ESG targets, with a focus on decarbonisation, have been set.\n\nIn one of the largest commitments of its kind globally, a significant USD 100 billion investment has been earmarked for a green transition and transport by 2030. This includes building Integrated Green Hydrogen Ecosystem encompassing three giga factories to develop 10 GW solar panels, 5 GW wind turbines and 5 GW hydrogen electrolysers and expanding the portfolio of Adani renewables to 50 GW. Five major companies - Adani Ports, Adani Green Energy, Adani Energy Solutions, ACC and Ambuja - have committed to achieving net zero by 2050. Furthermore, a pledge has been made at WEF's 1t.org to plant 100 million trees by 2030.\n\nThe Adani Foundation, currently touching over 9.1 million lives, is positioned to address the critical needs of New India in areas like health, nutrition, education, basic sanitation, women's livelihood and skills development.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Portfolio structure\n\nUnleashing growth and nation development with a world-class infrastructure and utility portfolio\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFlagship\n\nPrimary Industry\n\nEmerging B2C\n\nInfrastructure & Utility Core Portfolio\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Incubator                | Energy & Utility         | Transport & Logistics       | Transport & Logistics   | Materials, Metal &  Mining                                               | Direct to  Consumer   |    |\n|--------------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|----|\n| AEL AGEL Renewables      | AESL T&D                 | APSEZ Ports & Logistics     | NQXT                    | Cement 1 (70.33%)                                                        |                       |    |\n| (72.61%) (56.37%)        | (73.22%)                 | (65.89%)                    | (100%)                  | AWL                                                                      |                       |    |\n| (37.40%) ATGL Gas Discom | (71.75%) APL IPP         |                             |                         | (100%) Copper,  Aluminium                                                | Food FMCG             |    |\n|                          |                          | (100%) AAHL Airports (100%) |                         | (100%) PVC                                                               | (43.94%) NDTV         |    |\n| ANIL New  Industries     | AdaniConneX Data  Center |                             | ARTL Roads              | (100%) Specialist  Manufacturing 2 Mining Services  & Commercial  Mining | (100%) ADL Digital    |    |\n\nListed entity\n\nUnlisted entity\n\n## (%) Adani family's equity stake in the Adani portfolio companies\n\n(%) AEL equity stake\n\nHoldings are as on March 31, 2024, except for cement, in which holding is as on April 30, 2024.\n\nData center, JV with EdgeConneX, AEL : Adani Enterprises Limited; APSEZ : Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone Limited; AESL : Adani Energy Solutions Limited; APL : Adani Power Limited; AGEL : Adani Green Energy Limited; AAHL : Adani Airport Holdings Limited; ARTL : Adani Roads Transport Limited; ANIL : Adani New Industries Limited; AWL : Adani Wilmar Limited; ADL : Adani Digital Labs Private Limited; NDTV : New Delhi Television Limited; PVC : Polyvinyl Chloride; NQXT : North Queensland Export Terminal; ATGL: Adani Total Gas Ltd, JV with TotalEnergies; T&D: Transmission & Distribution; IPP: Independent Power Producer\n\n- 1 Cement business includes 70.33% stake in Ambuja Cements Limited which in turn owns 50.05% in ACC Limited, Adani directly owns 6.64% stake in ACC Limited.

I am immensely grateful for what we have achieved together. Your unwavering support and trust have fuelled our transformation and allowed us to emerge stronger than ever with the wherewithal to overcome every obstacle that has come our way.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur journey epitomised the essence of the - spirit that has always defined us and has allowed us to consistently turn setbacks into comebacks.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAmidst the challenges, our liquidity became our greatest asset. Augmenting our cash reserves, we raised approximately E 40,000 crore more, comfortably covering the next two years of our debt repayment.\n\n## From Trials to Triumph\n\nFor the Adani Group, 2023 was a year unlike any other. In the face of an unprecedented challenge and widespread scrutiny, our journey epitomised the essence of the spirit that has always defined us and has allowed us to  consistently  turn  setbacks  into  comebacks.  In  2023,  we  showed  our unbreakable spirit and proved that challenges could not weaken us; instead they became a testament to our ability to emerge stronger than ever.\n\nAs most of you know, we faced baseless accusations made by a U.S.-based short-seller that threatened to cast a shadow on our reputation and decades of hard work.\n\nTypical short-selling targets financial markets. This was far more insidious. It was a two-pronged attack, simultaneously targeting our financial standing and dragging us into the political arena. The onslaught was a calculated strike two days before the closing of our Follow-on Public Offer (FPO). Amplified by a segment of complicit media, it was designed to defame us, inflict maximum damage and erode our hard-earned market value.\n\nWe were, therefore, faced with a multi-dimensional crisis. Despite successfully raising ' 20,000 crore through the FPO, we made the extraordinary decision to  return  the  proceeds.  This  historic  move  underscored  our  unwavering dedication to our investors and our commitment to ethical business practices.\n\nAmidst the challenges, our liquidity became our greatest asset. Augmenting our cash reserves, we raised approximately ' 40,000 crore more, comfortably covering the next two years of our debt repayment. This decisive action is a testament to the strength of your company. It restored market confidence, and we safeguarded our portfolio against any volatility by pre-paying ' 17,500 crore in margin-linked financing.\n\nDespite  never  having  faced  any  challenges  with  debt  repayments  while operating  in  the  inherently  leveraged  infrastructure  sector,  we  dropped our Debt to EBIDTA ratio to 2.5x in just six months from 3.3x at the end of March 2023. It is now at 2.2x. We should keep in mind that five years ago, this ratio stood at 7x. This approach not only strengthens our financial resilience but also increases our capacity for future expansion.",

This is evidenced by powerful metrics: a remarkable growth rate, declining fiscal and current account deficits, surging exports, controlled inflation, and rising income levels.\n\nWe were further vindicated when the Supreme Court of India affirmed our actions, and our commitment to operational excellence and transparent disclosures was validated not only by rating agencies and the well-informed financial community but also by respected global investors. Partners like GQG Partners (U.S.), TotalEnergies Limited (Europe), IHC and QIA (Middle East), and even the U.S. Development Finance Corporation (DFC) stood firmly by our side, signalling unwavering confidence in our integrity.\n\nThe fact is that the spirit to fight back, the courage to stand up, and the will to overcome makes us stronger than ever. The storms that tested us became the very ones that fuelled our strength.\n\n## India's Moment: Navigating Complexity, Seizing Opportunity\n\nThe world stands at a crossroads. Geopolitical tensions strain relationships, the fight against climate change grows more challenging, and technological change disrupts the way we live and work. Amidst this uncertainty, a powerful light shines - the undeniable rise of India.\n\nIndia stands at a pivotal moment. A period where circumstances tilt in its favour, and decisive action can propel decades of growth and prosperity. Our nation is witnessing something extraordinary: a self-reinforcing cycle of progress. Growth feeds growth. India's trajectory is shaped by an exceptional time where opportunity and decisive action converge. This is evidenced by powerful metrics: a remarkable growth rate, declining fiscal and current account deficits, surging exports, controlled inflation, and rising income levels. These forces intertwine with declining poverty and expanding consumption, feeding corporate strength and slashing bank NPAs. This self-reinforcing cycle of progress is fuelled by domestic demand and amplified by global investors seeking stability and diversification, leading to record FDI inflows further bolstering the economy at a time of global insecurity.\n\nThe foundation of much of India's success rests in the clarity, consistency, and compassion of the government. Its focus on the welfare of the common citizen is transformative. Schemes like Direct Benefit Transfer, eliminating over 100 million fraudulent accounts and saving an astounding ' 3 lakh crore from misuse, Ayushman Bharat, saving the poor an estimated ' 1 lakh crore in healthcare expenses, the Prime Minister Ujjwala Yojana, providing clean cooking solutions to over 10 crore underserved citizens, or the Jal Jeevan Mission, which aims to supply 55 litres of water per person per day to every rural household, are more than just programmes - they are pillars of social progress that act as safeguards for the health and dignity of millions of our people. This trust in government emboldens the people and fuels their ambition.\n\nIt is this platform, established over the past decade, that has made India the world's fastest-growing major economy, a nation of scale, vision, and heart. In addition to the domestic success, its rising geopolitical stature and principled global engagement positions India as a leading force for stability\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nand progress during a tumultuous time as seen through initiatives like the G20 presidency.\n\nThis is India's moment. We are now the force for stability, cooperation, and progress in a complex world bolstered by vast domestic demand and propelled by the government's ambitious USD 2 trillion infrastructure investment target by 2030.\n\nWe, as a company, recognise this exceptional moment and that our ambitions are not just our own; they are interwoven with India's emergence as a true global power. India shines, and we shine with it.\n\n## Hum Karke Dikhate Hai: The Philosophy for Our Success\n\nIndia's robust macroeconomic stability and ambitious growth plans inspire unwavering  confidence  in  our  future.  The  pivotal  role  of  public-private partnerships  in  infrastructure  development,  fuelled  by  strong  multiplier effects,  reinforces  our  belief.  The  nation's  infrastructure  spending  has tripled in the past decade, with breakneck progress in highways, railways, and electrification. Initiatives like Gati Shakti will integrate infrastructure schemes (Bharatmala, Sagarmala, etc.) to drive logistics costs below 10%, bolstering competitiveness, and we are very well positioned to capitalise on such programmes.\n\nThis  infrastructure  push,  combined  with  policies  like  Make  in  India  and Production-Linked  Incentive  Schemes,  will  drive  investment  across  vital sectors - roads, airports, ports, power, railways, and data centers, each of these are core businesses for the Adani Group. As India's leading infrastructure player, we see a clear narrative of immense and predictable growth.\n\nOur record-breaking achievements in 2023 underscore our alignment with national priorities and our ability to execute the most complex, largescale projects with unmatched expertise.\n\nPicture our Khavda Renewable Energy Park, the world's largest RE plant spanning  several  hundreds  of  square  kilometres.  Already  generating 2,000 MW of clean energy, our aggressive timeline aims to develop 30 GW capacity in the next five years, enough to power nations like Belgium, Chile, and Switzerland. For us, this RE park is a symbol of our commitment to sustainability and a symbol of national pride.\n\nIn the spirit of sustainability, Adani Green became the proud sponsor of London Science Museum's stunning green energy gallery that looks at the past, present and future of energy systems. It is now considered one of the foremost museums that showcases how the world can generate and use energy more sustainably. It has quickly become a one-of-its-kind platform drawing and inspiring thousands of global visitors to understand solutions for an equitable and sustainable future.\n\n## USD 2 trillion\n\nGovernment of India's infrastructure investment target by 2030\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur record-breaking achievements in 2023 underscore our alignment with national priorities and our ability to execute the most complex, largescale projects with unmatched expertise.",

Picture  the Drishti 10 Starliner UAV, a symbol of Indian innovation, soaring through the skies, protecting our nation. These aren't just machines; they embody our unwavering dedication to India's well-being.\n\nFurther, visualise the world's largest slum at Dharavi in Maharashtra as we redevelop it over the next decade to provide dignity to over its 1 million residents. This is not a project of redevelopment; it's about dignity of living.\n\n## And we did not stop there.\n\nWe were privileged to have the Honourable Prime Minister inaugurate the state-of-the-art Terminal T3 at the Chaudhary Charan Singh International Airport in Lucknow, designed to accommodate 8 million passengers annually and enhance domestic and international connectivity.\n\nKutch Copper Limited, a pioneering project in Mundra, commenced operations at its greenfield copper refinery. By the end of this decade, we aim to make it the world's largest single-location copper smelter with a capacity of 1 MTPA, significantly enhancing India's self-reliance on a crucial metal needed for several critical industries.\n\nAdani Ports experienced an exceptional year, exceeding 400 MMT of cargo for the first time and handling a record 420 MMT as it continued to expand its position as India's premier commercial port with significant double-digit growth across most facilities.\n\nThe U.S. Development Finance Corporation injected USD 553 million into CWIT, Adani's joint venture in Sri Lanka, to develop a deepwater shipping container terminal at Colombo Port. This investment is a strategic step showcasing the confidence of the DFC on Adani's capabilities as well as towards bolstering Sri Lanka's economic recovery through private sector-led initiatives.\n\nFollowing the strategic acquisition of ACC and Ambuja Cements and the successful commissioning of our Ametha Integrated Unit, the Adani Group's combined cement capacity has risen from 67 MTPA to 78.9 MTPA. This puts us well on the path towards the 140 MTPA target we had set to achieve by 2028. Also, we are proud to state that Ambuja Cements was the lead supplier for the breathtaking Mumbai Trans Harbour Link, India's longest sea bridge covering 21.8 km that showcases its infrastructural prowess. Our approach is  clear  -  align  with  the  nation,  build  adjacencies,  and  de-risk  through integration. Today, we stand as a testament to India's growth trajectory. We consistently take on projects of immense scale that others wouldn't dream of, proving our ability to deliver complex infrastructure that will fuel the nation's rise and most importantly continue to ensure that we do so without compromising on our growth and financial numbers. This is best manifested in the all-round growth numbers we delivered in 2023-24.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Financial Performance: An All-Time Record\n\nIn terms of financial performance, I am delighted to state that we achieved an  unprecedented  milestone,  recording  the  highest-ever  EBITDA  of ' 82,917 crore (roughly USD 10 billion), a remarkable surge of 45%. This exceptional  financial  performance  drove  our  PAT  to  a  record  high  of ' 40,129 crore, marking a substantial 70.8% growth. Our net Debt to EBITDA further fell to 2.2x from 3.3x over the past year, giving us additional headroom for future growth. All of this resulted in an all-time-high levels of liquidity for the Group with a cash balance of ' 59,791 crore.\n\nThese  consistent  and  improved  metrics  demonstrate  our  highly  stable infrastructure platform, and led to a series of rating and outlook upgrades. Three  of  our  portfolio  companies  -  Ambuja,  ACC,  and  APSEZ,  are  now AAA rated.\n\n## Highlighting the performance of a few of our companies:\n\n## APL\n\nOur operating capacity increased by 12% to 15,250 MW, with the commissioning of the 1,600 MW Godda ultra-supercritical thermal power plant.\n\n## APSEZ\n\nIn addition to reaching 420 MMT and 10 of our ports recording lifetime high cargo volumes, we undertook successful acquisitions of Gopalpur and Karaikal ports.\n\n## AEL\n\nAs the incubation engine for the Group, AEL had a stellar year with three of our incubating businesses, including airports, green hydrogen eco-system and roads, picking up momentum. Passenger traffic at our airports witnessed a strong double-digit growth and stands at 88.6 million passengers. The solar manufacturing division has successfully commissioned a large-sized monocrystalline ingot and wafer unit, India's first, further enhancing control over the fully integrated green hydrogen production chain.\n\n## AGEL\n\nGiven the RE growth potential, we revised our FY 2029-30 target from 45 GW to 50 GW. In the year, we added 2.8 GW, 15% of India's total renewable capacity addition. This includes the commissioning of the first 2 GW at the world's largest RE park at Khavda within 12 months of breaking ground, which highlights our execution capabilities.\n\n## E 82,917 Cr\n\nHighest-ever portfolio-level EBITDA in FY 2023-24",

This has been an exceptional year for Adani Power as we have delivered outstanding operational and financial performance, soaring to newer heights and setting newer benchmarks. The team has done a great job in consolidating our position as India's foremost thermal IPP, ensuring optimal operations of all assets and ramping up capacities to meet power demand competitively and reliably.\n\nAnil Sardana Managing Director\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nS. B. Khyalia\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nChief Executive Officer\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn a testament to our commitment to excellence, we proudly commissioned the 1,600 MW Godda Ultra-supercritical thermal power plant, marking a historic milestone in pioneering a transnational project.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## A Thriving Operating Context\n\nThe Indian power market and the broader economy have maintained the robust growth trajectory witnessed since the pandemic lockdowns were lifted. The Indian economy, despite facing inflationary pressures and challenges in the export market due to global headwinds, performed resiliently to emerge as one of the fastest-growing economies. Expansive infrastructure endeavours, booming  industrial and manufacturing activity and robust domestic consumption, contributed to a strong GDP growth of 7.6% as against 7.0% in FY 2022-23.\n\nAgainst a flourishing economy and further catalysed by population expansion and urbanisation trends, power demand in India reached unprecedented levels in FY 2023-24. The electrification of villages, railways and mobility infrastructure further contributed to this. The total electricity demand during the year increased by 7.5% to 1,626 billion units, while peak power demand reached a record high of 243.27 GW in September 2023.\n\nThe power generation sector stood up admirably to the challenge, keeping pace with the escalating power needs of the nation. Supported by transformative regulations and capacity additions, the industry stood firm to effectively meet most of the base load and peak demand.\n\n## Powering Progress and Performance\n\nOur team did a commendable job of seizing the favourable macro situation, as reflected in a robust operating performance and impressive developments through FY 2023-24.\n\nIn a testament to our commitment to excellence, we proudly commissioned the 1,600 MW Godda Ultra-supercritical thermal power plant, marking a historic milestone in pioneering a transnational project. The plant is now supplying much-needed electricity to Bangladesh under a long-term contract. The Mahan Energen Plant, acquired in FY 2021-22, has been successfully turned around and has started posting healthy profits, benefiting from our expertise in managing power sales, fuel sourcing, and power plant operations. Both these plants have ramped up well and are achieving high levels of availability.\n\nWe have made significant strides in enhancing our fuel management and logistics capabilities. While a substantial portion of our domestic coal requirements are secured under long- and medium-term contracts, fuel supply is being de-risked by increasingly utilising coal from commercial mines. These efforts have ensured steady  fuel  availability  at  optimised  costs,  facilitating  uninterrupted  plant operations. The average PLF in FY 2023-24 improved to 64.7%  while commercial availability was maintained at optimum levels, resulting in full capacity charge collection and stable profitability.\n\nSales volume during the year increased  by 48.5% to 79.3 billion units, supported by incremental addition from the Godda power plant, and strong performances of Mundra, Udupi, Raipur, and Mahan plants. A reduction in import fuel prices helped revive power offtake strongly from coastal Mundra and Udupi plants.\n\nThe  all-round  improvement  in  operations  translated  into  tangible  financial success, with a strong 40% growth in total revenue to ' 60,281 crore. The growth was on account of capacity expansion, one-time prior period revenue recognition on account of regulatory recoveries and higher dispatches in the merchant  and  short-term  markets  as  well  as  under  long  and  medium-term",

By leveraging our strengths and capabilities, we are diligently building a more agile, responsive and sustainable enterprise. The intent is to play an ever-increasing role in fulfilling the nation's power demand while addressing environmental concerns and generating enduring value for our stakeholders.\n\nIntegrated Annual Report 2023-24\n\ncontracts. During the year, Hon'ble Supreme Court pronounced judgements that upheld the Company's claims on account of domestic coal shortfall and provided conclusive clarity on the regulatory philosophy to be followed.\n\nStrong revenue growth, coupled with lower imported fuel prices and improved fuel cost recovery following regulatory orders contributed to a commendable growth in EBITDA by 96% to ' 28,111 crore. Strong cash flows from operations and  regulatory  recoveries  helped  the  Company  to  reduce  leverage,  in  turn helping  improve  its  credit  rating  assigned  by  CRISIL  and  India  Ratings from A to AA- during the course of the year.  As a result, finance costs were firmly in control, and led to a strong growth in Profit After Tax by 94% to ' 20,829 crore.\n\n## Building an Enterprise for the Future\n\nThe  power  sector  presents  immense  potential  for  growth.  As  the  Indian economy sustains its high growth trajectory, driven by infrastructure creation, manufacturing activity, and a transition to e-mobility, the electricity demand is  set  to  surge.  The  Central  Electricity  Authority  forecasts  India's  energy requirement to touch 1,736 BUs in FY 2024-25 with a peak demand of 260 GW, while in the longer term the energy requirement is expected to reach 2,474 BU with a peak demand of 366 GW by 2031-32.\n\nAmidst  this  landscape,  the  Government  has  rightly  identified  reliable  and accessible electricity supply to be a key enabler to sustain a 9-10% economic growth. While renewable energy remains a focal point for climate-conscious growth, thermal power will continue to assume importance in the overall mix, given its criticality in supplying base load power and bridging the gap during periods of low renewable energy generation. This narrative is further reinforced by India's abundant coal reserves and the advancements made in coal-fired power generation technologies, which not only enhance affordability but also contribute to the sustainability of thermal power.\n\nAdani  Power  remains  committed  to  fortifying  India's  energy  security.  By leveraging our strengths and capabilities, we are diligently building a more agile, responsive and sustainable enterprise. The intent is to play an ever-increasing role in fulfilling the nation's power demand while addressing environmental concerns and generating enduring value for our stakeholders.\n\nWe are investing in cutting-edge technologies and exploring avenues for cleaner and more efficient coal-based power generation. We plan to add 4,800 MW of brownfield capacity over the next few years in addition to proposed acquisitions, bringing our total to 24,270 MW. This includes the 1,600 MW Mahan Phase II Ultra-supercritical power project (USCTPP), which is under construction and scheduled for commissioning in FY 2027-28. We have similarly also initiated development work for a 1,600 MW USCTPP brownfield expansion of the Raigarh power plant in Chhattisgarh.\n\nWe have also undertaken several initiatives targeted at improving operating efficiencies and uptime of power plants. Project Beacon is one of our flagship endeavours through which we are integrating digitalisation and analytics into all functional aspects. The Analytics Center of Excellence, tasked to implement the project, was established at Tiroda and Kawai plants. It is currently executing more than 125 improvement projects in the areas of environment, health and safety (EHS), coal planning, advanced process control and O&M costs. It will contribute to more efficient, predictable and safe operations along with better analytical and decision-making tools.\n\n## Sustainability\n\nAdani  Power  continues  to  exhibit  pioneering  measures  on  the  ESG  front, outperforming its peers on multiple parameters. This includes a score of 48/100 in the Corporate Sustainability Assessment (CSA) by S&P Global, 3.5/5 in the FTSE ESG rating and an 88% score in the CSRHub ESG rating. We are also a constituent company in the FTSE4Good Index Series.\n\nAdani  Power  remains  committed  to  decarbonisation  and  environmental stewardship. All our power plants are operating admirably well under statutory limits  for  specific  water  consumption.  We  continue  to  invest  in  efficient generation and emission control technologies. Presently, 72% of our capacity utilises  ultra-supercritical/supercritical  technology  which  is  more  efficient and has lower emissions. Going forward Ultra-supercritical technology will be exclusively for new capacity additions, as we have done in the case of the Godda power plant. Equipped with the most advanced and sustainable technologies, it is set to be a showcase for generating thermal power most efficiently and sustainably. We are also setting a new precedent with a ground-breaking green ammonia combustion pilot project for our Mundra power plant, in partnership with Japan's IHI Corporation and Kowa.\n\nOur social programmes in association with the Adani Foundation benefited more than 2.3 million lives including those of the tribal population in the vicinity of our plants. Our interventions around education, health, sustainable livelihoods, skill development and community infrastructure are bringing meaningful change in the society and have improved their living standards.\n\n## Closing Comments\n\nLooking ahead, the opportunities before us are abundant. We have reinforced our position as a pre-eminent player in the industry with large and efficient capacities,  cutting-edge  technology,  operational  excellence  and  a  talented workforce. Our operations are highly resilient, supported by a balanced mix of long-term PPAs and merchant capacities, excellent fuel security and strategically located assets. Now with our expansion plans, we are poised to ascend greater heights while serving peak and base load demand.\n\nThe  resolution  of  regulatory  issues  has  ushered  in  much-needed  clarity and  stability  within  our  operational  landscape.  Governmental  interventions to  encourage  DISCOMs  to  make  timely  payments  have  yielded  positive results, bolstering our cash flows, and creating a foundation for a financially sound future.\n\nTogether,  these  initiatives  and  developments  coalesce  to  create  a  firm foundation on which we shall continue to achieve superior performance and create  stakeholder  value  sustainably.  We  extend  our  gratitude  to  all  our stakeholders for their continued support. Your continued trust and confidence in  us  will  be  crucial  in  our  journey  of  growth,  nation  building  and  shared value creation.\n\n## Anil Sardana,\n\nManaging Director\n\nS. B.

Plant heads are responsible for recognising, notifying and mitigating any form of risk they observe or foresee at the plant level. To ensure effective identification and anticipation, employees from all departments are engaged in regular dialogue and operate under an open-door policy. We further provide performance-linked incentives to employees and leadership based on energy efficiency and climate change mitigation KRAs.\n\nWhile climate change is one of the most significant risks, we\n\nrecognise that thermal power will remain important for meeting India's growing energy needs. We remain focused on this segment and are taking the necessary measures to improve efficiency and reduce the environmental impact of our operations.

Impact value is calculated based on this to determine whether risks are catastrophic, critical, moderate or marginal. Further, lead and lag indicators are defined along with risk indicator threshold to ensure their efficacy\n- \u0083 Each risk is associated with performance measures to gauge its impact on business processes: this includes measuring for efficiency (In-Process) with factors like risk mitigation completion index, risks overlooked and accuracy of identified risks, and for effectiveness with metrics such as risks causing losses, declining residual value, unplanned disruptions, and recovery time meeting customer expectations\n- \u0083 After considering mitigation strategies and risk insurance\n\nRisk assessment and prioritisation\n\nRisk mitigation\n\neach risk is given residual risk impact and frequency score, and a dedicated risk owner and champion are assigned for effective mitigation and control\n\n- \u0083 Linking identified risks with organisational strategic objectives or functional objectives and relevant business processes\n\n## Risk Assessment and Prioritisation\n\n- \u0083 Risks are assessed and prioritised based on likelihood, impact, proximity and controllability\n- \u0083 Risks are categorised into Strategic or Reputational Risk (those impacting business decisions and reputation), Tactical Risk (those rising from changes in business conditions) and Operational Risk (those relating to daily activities)\n\n## Risk Mitigation\n\n- \u0083 Formulating comprehensive mitigation strategies involving mitigation action, costs, benefits, frequency and target completion date, and establishing risk indicators for tracking\n- \u0083 A robust governance structure is in place to ensure the process efficacy, with ongoing reviews by the Functional and Station Risk Management Committees\n\n## Risk Rreatment\n\n- \u0083 4T analysis for risk treatment including:\n- \u00b7  Tolerate: Accepting risks when their potential impact is within limits or when anticipated profit outweighs the costs of potential risk\n- \u00b7  Treat: Adjusting project plan and company process to reduce risk impact as well as lowering the possibility of risk occurrence to decrease associated financial value\n- \u00b7  Transfer: Sharing or distributing risk consequences among project participants, business departments or third parties like vendors or business partner\n- \u00b7  Terminate: Eliminating risk by getting rid of its cause, often through risk avoidance strategy to prevent damaging events\n\n## Review and Monitoring\n\n- \u0083 Monitoring and reporting risks and mitigation status to identify trends and prioritise measures\n- \u0083 Review by Functional Committee followed by BRMC committee to identify focus areas and mitigation plans to drive positive risk trends\n\nRisk treatment Review and monitoring\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Key Risks

The executive management and the employees take responsibility for identifying and assessing climate-related risks and opportunities. We have implemented location-specific risk management systems and conducted scenario analysis to understand climate-related transitional and physical risks' impact on our business, strategies and financial performance.\n\nWe use IPCC's Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) to assess the physical risks associated\n\nwith climate change (chronic and acute). It describes different climate futures most likely to occur depending on the volume of greenhouse gases emitted. We have conducted these assessments for all existing power plants and mandate them for all upcoming power plants. These assessments are carried out for various types of risks (legal, technology, market, reputation) across short (0-5 years), medium (5-10 years) and long-term (10-20 years) horizons, and influence plant modifications, including those done for Mundra Power Plant's structural design.\n\nThe relevant and applicable climate-related transitional and physical risks identified are as follows:\n\n## Transitional risk\n\n## Risk and description\n\n## Current Regulation\n\nOur business is subject to several environmental regulations, including those focused on reducing carbon emissions volume.

While this shift is expected to decrease the share of coal-based power generation in the energy mix, the government of India is taking proactive measures to extend electricity access to the remotest areas.\n\n## Reputation\n\nHonouring commitments and aligning with a shared vision embraced by both internal and external stakeholders is essential. Given the inherent nature of our business, it is prone to legal proceedings and complexities, posing reputational risks.\n\nWe are frontrunners in making technology advancements to meet the market requirements, initiating ammonia co-firing and green hydrogen projects/pilots to maintain a competitive edge.\n\nWe strictly adhere to all applicable statutory requirements and ensure zero tolerance for non-compliance, with our Compliance Officer overseeing regular reviews of compliance status.\n\nWe have a robust IT-enabled compliance management system, providing real-time updates via dashboards and alerts on non-compliance. It also serves as a resource library providing a comprehensive matrix on all applicable legal, statutory and regulatory laws and its management.\n\nWe are meeting the market requirements through our investments in capacity creation and building world-class power plants with advanced technologies to meet growing electricity needs at competitive rates.\n\nWe have a Reputation Risk Committee under the Risk Management Committee to manage and oversee reputational risks arising from business operations.\n\n## Physical risk\n\n## Risk and description\n\n## Acute Physical\n\nPhysical risks arising from extreme weather events like cyclones and hurricanes induced by climate change can impact our infrastructure and processes leading to operational failures and necessitating additional investments to rebuild and restore the damages. They can also adversely impact resource-procurement capabilities. These can directly impact our resource quality and quantity.\n\nWe have upgraded our infrastructure to withstand wind speeds and high tides from tropical storms. Additionally, we have invested in technology tools for continuous monitoring of weather conditions, prediction and early warning alerts. This enables taking necessary precautionary measures during extreme events supported by SOPs for preparation and maintenance checks. We have developed SOPs for proper early warning systems using advanced technology tools and applications, alongside imparting training to all asset management teams.\n\n## Chronic Physical\n\nProlonged temperature rises and changes in weather patterns can significantly impact our business and create long-term repercussions on the availability and quality of resources. This necessitates getting accurate climate projections and evaluating the risks from emerging regulations as well as physical risks to critical infrastructure like power plants and grid-connected T&D lines.\n\nWe used the IPCC's RCP 4.5 scenario (equivalent to 1.7-3.2) to study the projected changes in climate parameters. This included monthly maximum temperature and precipitation, severe drought likelihood, probability of heat/cold wave, mean drought index and land projected to be below annual flood level.\n\nThe initial study encompassed all power plants, major T&D lines and the supply chain, including logistics. Appropriate risk quantification and mitigation measures are being developed for these sites, such as maintaining sufficient coal stock for possible high precipitation events and increasing water reservoirs for possible water shortage events.\n\nTo mitigate rising sea levels and cyclonic surge risks due to global warming, the Mundra plant's finished floor level has been raised to 10 m above the Chart Datum (CD) - the lowest astronomical tides and mean low water. This provides a significant buffer against the highest high tide recorded of 5.4 m above the CD. To adapt to climate-related water temperature increases in future, we have equipped all thermal power plants with induced draft cooling towers with a re-circulation system. This will maintain the desired temperature difference across the condenser, ensuring sustained plant efficiency.\n\n## Mitigation actions\n\n<!-- image -->",

Maintaining high levels of data integrity, availability, and confidentiality is imperative for businesses heavily reliant on information technology. Escalating\n\ncyber-attacks pose significant risks and incur substantial costs, underscoring the urgent need for robust security systems, especially in the Power sector. Despite the benefits of ICT devices in automation, they heighten vulnerability, necessitating stringent cyber security protocols. We diligently comply with Government and regulatory requirements\n\ntailored for power sector entities, safeguarding stakeholders' interests. Heightening the security of the Company's digital architecture ensures uninterrupted operations and prevents data breaches, reinforcing our commitment to data security and privacy.\n\n## Cybersecurity Framework\n\nAdani Power adopts a risk-based approach, utilising the NIST Cyber Security framework and ISO-27001:2013 Standard to fortify its cybersecurity programme. We focus on sustaining our status as a technology leader, with an information and cyber security policy promoting a pervasive\n\nStrategic Review\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ncybersecurity culture. This policy not only covers information systems but also extends to the protection of industrial control systems, whether managed internally or by third-party operations. It is underpinned by cybersecurity rules aligned with our cybersecurity structure and is subject to annual review.\n\n## Cybersecurity Implementation\n\nLed by the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO), we have established a dedicated cybersecurity function reporting to senior management. The CISO directs the development and oversight of the cybersecurity programme, prioritising threat identification, analysis, and response. We continuously bolster the cyber defenses across people, processes, and technology, ensuring resilience against cyber threats and reinforcing stakeholder trust in the digital age.\n\n## Governance Structure for Cyber Security Management\n\n## Three Lines of Defence Model\n\nWe have implemented a \"Three Lines of Defence\" model to govern and oversee cyber risk management systematically. This approach ensures coordinated management with clear segregation of duties. Roles and responsibilities are well-defined within these lines of defence, enabling the Company to centralise cybersecurity governance under the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO).\n\n## Lines of Defence Responsibilities:\n\n- \ufffd First Line of Defence: Comprising functions like Control & Instrumentation (C&I),\n\nSupervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) operations, and Information Technology. This line identifies cyber risks within projects and operations. Line managers are accountable for managing cyber risks and adhering to security policies within their respective functions\n\n- \ufffd Second Line of Defence: Managed by the Cybersecurity function, this line continuously monitors the design and operation of controls in the first line. It provides guidance, sets policies, and reports the cybersecurity programme's status to senior management\n- \ufffd Third Line of Defence: Independent Assurance ensures oversight of both the first and second lines' efforts. This includes internal and external auditors who assure senior management regarding cybersecurity efforts\n\n## Continuous Review and Oversight\n\nAdani Power's \"three lines of defence\" model evolves continually to ensure robust protections and controls. Senior management regularly reviews cyber risks and programme performance. Additionally, the Company's focussed 'Info Tech and Data Security committee' established by the Board of Directors, receives periodic reports from the CISO on the cybersecurity programme's status and performance. The committee also monitors emerging trends and incidents within the cyber domain, enhancing the Company's cyber resilience within the cyber domain.",

        "page_content": "## Management Discussion & Analysis\n\n## Global Economic Overview\n\nThe global economy displayed a resilient performance in 2023 after a turbulent year. Despite tumultuous geopolitical events, increased volatility in energy and commodity markets, and aggressive monetary tightening to combat stubborn inflation, global economic growth has decelerated but not halted. According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), economic growth is estimated to be slower at 3.2% in 2024, same as in 2023.\n\nEconomic  growth  in  several  emerging  markets  and developing economies has surpassed expectations in 2023. Another silver lining is the strongest recovery of the US economy among major economies, marked by a stronger performance in private consumption. The GDP of the US increased from 1.9% in 2022 to 2.5% in 2023. The European Union has so far weathered shocks that are unprecedented in recent history, triggered by the prolonged Russia-Ukraine war, and the lingering effects of tight monetary policy as well as higher interest rates and energy costs. Its GDP growth slowed from 3.6% in 2022 to 0.6% in 2023. On the other hand, China's economy expanded by 5.2% in 2023 from 3.0% in 2022.\n\nGlobal  inflation  continues  to  recede  at  a  faster pace from 8.7% in 2022 to 6.8% in 2023, fostering optimism  for  further  easing  of  financial  conditions and  improvement  of  monetary  policy  frameworks, although uncertainty about the timing of interest rate reduction persists.\n\nMoreover, the average price of Brent crude oil decreased to USD 83 per barrel in 2023, down from USD 101 per barrel in 2022, and crude oil price volatility has remained low for most of the first quarter of 2024. The average annual price for Australian coal saw a decrease from USD 344.9/tonne in 2022 to USD 172.8/tonne in 2023. While coal demand continues to thrive in emerging and developing economies, the International Energy Agency (IEA) predicts global coal demand to decline by 2026 due to expansion of global renewable capacity and a shift towards alternative energy sources, away from fossil fuels in response to increasing environmental concerns.\n\n(Source: IMF Economic Outlook, April 2024; EIA; World Bank; IEA; RBI MPC Meeting 2024)\n\n## Outlook\n\nThe Reserve Bank of India projects global growth to remain steady in 2024. The IMF forecasts a global growth of 3.2% for both 2024 and 2025.\n\n## Region-wise growth (%)\n\n| Region                                           |     |   2023  2024 (E) |   2025 (P) |\n|--------------------------------------------------|-----|------------------|------------|\n| Global Economy                                   | 3.2 |              3.2 |        3.2 |\n| Advanced  Economies                              | 1.6 |              1.7 |        1.8 |\n| (AEs) Emerging Markets and  Developing Economies | 4.3 |              4.2 |        4.2 |\n\n(E - Estimates, P - Projections)\n\n(Source: International Monetary Fund)\n\nThe global economic outlook for 2024 faces the risk of persistence of elevated interest rates and core inflation, withdrawal of fiscal support amid high debt weighing on  economic  activity,  and  economic  uncertainties. Furthermore, heightened geopolitical tensions could pose downside risks to the global economy through tightening of energy and commodity prices. However, with faster disinflation and steady growth, the possibility of a severe economic downturn has diminished, and risks to global economic expansion are broadly balanced. Other positive factors,  such  as  stronger-than-expected  economic performance of the US and several large emerging market and developing economies, economic stimulus in China, the resilience of Europe amid the ongoing war and the easing of supply chain bottlenecks will bolster the outlook of the global economy. After rapid expansion in 2023, the Asia-Pacific (APAC) region is expected to be the fastest-growing region of the world economy in 2024, supported by robust domestic demand in East Asia and India.\n\n(Source: IMF Economic Outlook, April 2024; RBI MPC Meeting 2024; S&P Global)\n\n## Indian Economic Overview\n\nAmid a challenging global economic landscape and deteriorating geopolitical conditions, India has been a bright spot. It is the fifth-largest economy in the world and is poised to retain its position as the world's fastest-growing major economy. Its GDP growth remained buoyant at 7.6% in FY 2023- 24 as against 7% in FY 2022-23,",

Furthermore, an accelerated pace of economic reforms and increased capital expenditure facilitated construction activities and created extensive employment opportunities across the country.\n\n| Region   |     |    |   FY 2021-22 FY 2022-23 FY 2023-24 (E) |\n|----------|-----|----|----------------------------------------|\n| Real GDP | 9.1 |  7 |                                    7.6 |\n\n(E - Estimates)\n\n(Source: Ministry of Statistics & Programme Implementation)\n\nThe Government's thrust on infrastructure investments and emphasis on expanding the share of manufacturing in the GDP were seen to have supported GDP growth in FY 2023-24 through a growth of 10.7% in the Construction sector and 8.5% growth in the Manufacturing sector. The Index of Industrial Production (IIP) growth rate for FY 2023-24 indicates a 5.8% increase compared to the previous year. Furthermore, India's per capita income is estimated to have reached ' 2.14 lakhs in FY 2023-24, achieving remarkable growth of 8.0%. Rising levels of disposable income have led to an upswing in household consumption, thereby stimulating demand across various sectors.\n\nDespite repetitive food price shocks, India's CPI inflation is on a downward trajectory and eased to 4.83% in April 2024. The RBI has thus far maintained the policy repo rate at 6.50% with an aim to achieve the target of 4% inflation while supporting economic growth.\n\nIt is expected that structural interventions implemented by the government will continue to strengthen the infrastructural  and  manufacturing  base,  create economies of scale, increase exports and make India an integral part of the global value chain. 'Make in India' has made significant achievements and is now focussing on 27 sectors under 'Make in India 2.0' to make India a manufacturing hub. The government has also implemented an investor-friendly Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) policy, allowing 100% FDI in most sectors through the automatic route, except for specific strategically important sectors. In the power sector, 100% FDI is allowed under the automatic route for generation from all sources (except atomic energy), transmission and distribution of electric energy, and Power Trading.\n\n(Source:  Ministry  of  Statistics  &  Programme Implementation; Ministry of Finance; RBI; Ministry of Commerce & Industry)\n\n## Outlook\n\nIndia's economic outlook remains positive as it reaps the benefits of demographic dividend, a skilled and productive workforce, physical and digital infrastructure enhancements, increased capital expenditure, and the government's proactive policy measures. According to the IMF, the Indian economy is expected to advance steadily at 6.8% in 2024 and 6.5% in 2025. On the other hand, the RBI's forecast is more optimistic, projecting a higher GDP growth of 7.0% for FY 2024-25, while CPI inflation is expected to decline to 4.5% in FY 2024-25.\n\nPotential risks to India's economic outlook arise from headwinds  from  geopolitical  tensions,  volatility  in international  financial  markets  and  geoeconomic fragmentation.  However,  India's  advantageous geopolitical position will help it capitalise on supply chain diversification and reshoring, increase its global competitiveness and boost exports. Amid a volatile global  macro  environment,  the  Indian  economy  is poised to ascend as a global economic powerhouse and become the third-largest economy in the world by 2030. The Interim Budget 2024-25 outlines a multi-pronged economic management strategy, including infrastructure development,  digital  public  infrastructure,  taxation reforms and proactive inflation management. It sets the foundation for the vision of a 'Viksit Bharat' (Developed India) by 2047.\n\n(Source: IMF Economic Outlook, April 2024; Economic Times; RBI; Ministry of Finance)\n\n## Power Industry Scenario\n\nIndia, the world's most populous nation, is also the third largest producer of electricity globally, with installed generation capacity (utilities) of nearly 442 GW as on March 31, 2024.\n\nIndia has invested heavily in augmentation of its power generation capacity after opening the sector up with wide-ranging  reforms.  India's  conventional  power generation capacity grew in multiples after the passage of the the Electricity Act, 2003. Over the last decade, the emphasis of investments has shifted to renewable energy in view of national as well as international goals for combating climate change.",

        "page_content": "Going forward, the energy and peak power deficits are expected to subsist for several years, as the power demand is expected to be strong. Even though renewable energy capacity  additions  have  outstripped  thermal  power additions, the growth has been slower than expected.\n\nThe Ministry of Power of the Indian government, in consultation with the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy, has specified a trajectory of Renewable Purchase Obligations (RPOs) that has to be followed by DISCOMs to  purchase  a  certain  percentage  of  total  energy consumed by them from renewable sources. Under this trajectory, DISCOMs have to meet 43.33% RPO by the year 2029-30. Along with this, the Indian government has also announced a target to achieve 50% of total installed generation capacity from non-fossil sources by the year 2029-30.\n\nConsequently, various DISCOMs have been buying power in increasing quantum from renewable sources to meet their RPO obligations through lon-term contracts. At the same time, they have also increasingly relied on the merchant and short-term markets to meet incremental power demand.\n\nHowever, higher demand has also resulted in merchant prices  shooting  up,  resulting  in  market  disruptions and government interventions. DISCOMs are therefore expected to invite bids for long-term contracts for supply of power from conventional sources like thermal power.\n\nFurther, the need for ensuring reliability of power supply in an era of increasing penetration from intermittent sources like renewables is being felt considering the projected growth in power demand. As a result, DISCOMs are expected to continue to rely on thermal power to meet the growing baseload power requirements by entering into new long-term contracts, in addition to drawing more power from existing capacities and hence helping to improve the average PLFs of the sector.\n\n## Coal demand and supply\n\nCoal continues to power a major portion of India's energy needs, accounting for more than 72% of the nation's power generation in FY 2023-24.\n\nIndia is endowed with plentiful supplies of this crucial natural  resource,  which  enhances  energy  security and helps strengthen the reliability and resilience of its energy sector, which contributes to the nation's continued growth and prosperity. In times of growing energy demand, driven by a surging economy, coal as a primary fuel has witnessed an unprecedented upswing in domestic production and despatch, while imports have exhibited a declining trend.\n\nDuring FY 2023-24, the production of coal in India grew by nearly 12% to 997 million tonnes. Of this, Coal India Limited produced 774 million tonnes registering 10% growth. Coal despatched to power utilities also grew by 5% to reach 618 MT during this period.\n\nWhile domestic coal production has been picking up significantly, the strong growth in power demand as well as economic activity has led to a higher reliance on imports of coal. Total imports of coal registered in FY 2023-24 till February 2024 were 239 MT, as compared to 238 MT during the whole of FY 2022-23.\n\nThe Ministry of Coal estimates overall demand for coal to reach 1,448 MT by 2029-30, of which the power sector will account for 1,034 MT. Public sector coal miners are expected to hold up their commitment to maintain consistent coal production and despatch, ensuring an uninterrupted supply for a reliable and resilient energy sector. At the same time, captive mines are expected to increase their production to 175 MT in 2024-25, as compared to 145 MT more than estimated in 2023-24. Output from mines recently auctioned to the private sector is expected to contribute 20 million tonnes in 2024-25.\n\nImported  coal  prices,  which  had  shot  up  following disruptions in natural gas supply consequent to the war in Ukraine, have started to come down as gas supply has improved. Indonesia is expected to cut its production to 710 MT in 2024, as compared to a record output of 775 MT in 2023. Lower gas prices amidst an oversupply in the global gas markets will create negative pressures on Indonesia's lower calorific value coal demand. This trend will be supported further by China's resumption of coal imports from Australia and high inventories due to improved domestic production of coal in the country.\n\n## Adani Power Limited (Adani Power): Stronger Than Ever\n\nAdani Power is India's largest private thermal power producer with a power generation capacity of 15,250 MW, consisting of 15,210 MW thermal power capacity and 40 MW solar power capacity. Of this, 1,600 MW capacity caters to power supply to Bangladesh, while the balance 13,650 MW is being supplied within India. In addition to this, an expansion project of 1,600 MW Ultra-supercritical power plant is also underway, which will take the operating capacity to 16,850 MW upon completion.\n\nOut of the current and under-construction capacity, 10,840  MW  of  thermal  power  capacity,  comprising a  4,620  MW  plant  at  Mundra,  Kutch  in  Gujarat,  a 3,300 MW plant at Tiroda, Gondia in Maharashtra, a 1,320 MW plant at Kawai, Baran in Rajasthan, and 1,600 MW",

The installed capacity as of March 31, 2024 was 15,250 MW.\n\nThe PLF at the Kawai and Tiroda plants stayed above 70% due to continuous high grid demand and better domestic coal availability under Fuel Supply Agreements. At the same time, the PLF at Mundra improved due to higher grid offtake following growth in power demand coupled with lower prices of imported coal. Similarly, the PLF of Udupi improved significantly due to improvement in merit order position owing to low imported coal price and higher grid demand in Karnataka. The PLFs of Raipur, Raigarh, and Mahan were also strong mainly due to improved availability of domestic coal and high demand from the merchant / short-term markets. The Godda plant ramped up satisfactorily and achieved a high PLF in its first year of operation.\n\nAs a result of higher PLF and greater operating capacity, Adani Power achieved a power sales volume of 79.3 Billion Units (BUs) during FY 2023-24, which was 48% higher than the sales volume of 53.4 BUs achieved during FY 2022-23.\n\n## Plant-wise PLF and power sales trend in FY 2023-24\n\n## Consolidated PLF (%)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFY 2022-23\n\nFY 2023-24",

Does the entity have processes in place to avoid/ manage conflict of interests involving members of the Board? (Yes/No) If Yes, provide details of the same.\n\nYes, APL has the policy on code of conduct applicable for All the members of the Board of Directors & All the members of the Senior Management of the Company\n\nThe objective of the Code is to maintain standards of business conduct of the Company and ensure compliance with Applicable Laws. Towards this end, the Code lays down standards and values which can enhance the image of the Company and set the standards for business transactions and also deter wrong doing in all business related activities.\n\nAll the members of the Board of Directors and Senior Management of the Company are expected to dedicate their best efforts to advance the Company's interests and to make decisions that affect the Company based on the Company's best interests and independent of outside influences.\n\nA conflict of interest occurs when a director's/member's of Senior Management private interest interferes in any way, or even appears to interfere, with the interest of the Company as a whole. Directors and members of Senior Management of the Company should avoid conflicts of interests with the Company. Any situation that involves, or may reasonably be expected to involve, a conflict of interest with the Company shall be disclosed promptly to the Company Secretary of the Company.\n\n## Principle 2: Businesses should provide goods and services in a manner that is sustainable and safe.\n\n## 1.

(Yes/No) If yes, what percentage of inputs were sourced sustainably?\n\nYes.\n\nYes, 100% percentage of inputs were sourced as per our supply chain management policy, which effectively governs our sustainable supply chain management practices. We ensure that our supplier selection process integrates the prerequisites of sustainability.\n\nOur supplier Code of Conduct acts as a framework for assessing and disseminating the company's requirements, values, and culture to suppliers. We also encourage our suppliers to adhere to social and environmental standards such as SA 8000, ISO 14001:2015, and ISO 45001:2018. Moreover, we have also devised a supplier screening and risk assessment programme which serves as an initiatory requirement in our vendor onboarding process.\n\nIn addition to the regulatory and qualitative aspects, our supplier assessment scorecard also incorporates ESG aspects  for  screening  and  prequalification  of  our  suppliers.  We  have  classified  our  suppliers  and  identified them as critical based on value of business and nature of supply. Further, our supplier screening framework is used to assess the identified critical suppliers on predefined ESG parameter which act as a key enabler on our Responsible Supply Chain journey.\n\n## 3. Describe the processes in place to safely reclaim your products for reusing, recycling and disposing at the end of life, for (a) Plastics (including packaging) (b) E-waste (c) Hazardous waste and (d) other waste.\n\nOwing to the nature of the Company's product/service offerings [Generation of Electricity], the scope for safely reclaiming products for reuse, recycling, and disposal at the end of life is not applicable.\n\nIn alignment with the UN SDG 12- Responsible Consumption and Production, the company have defined processes for managing waste at all our operational sites.\n\nEffective waste management begins with meticulous planning, ensuring that our waste management plan prioritizes  efficient  and  cost  effective  techniques.  This  plan  encompasses  a  range  of  activities,  including waste collection, segregation, transportation, reprocessing, recycling, and disposal of different types of waste. Our thermal power plants generate various forms of waste, with fly ash (a by-product of coal combustion) being the largest solid waste component. Additionally, we handle other types of waste such as municipal or domestic waste, hazardous waste, biomedical waste, and e-waste. The disposal methods depend on the type and quality of waste generated.\n\nFly ash, being a significant solid waste produced from coal-based power generation, poses a landfilling challenge. To address this, our Tiroda plant has implemented a High Concentration Slurry Disposal (HCSD) system, which solidifies the ash for disposal. Furthermore, we have established infrastructure at other plants to transform fly ash into a valuable material in demand by industries such as cement and ready-mix concrete. This approach has substantially increased fly ash utilization and supply, benefiting specialised agencies. We are dedicated to reducing single-use plastic usage, and 9 out of 7 of our power-generating units have received certification for being single-use plastic-free from the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII). At our Tiroda, Kawai, Udupi, we have installed a waste-paper recycling unit.\n\nRegarding hazardous waste, we generate a comparatively smaller quantity, which is stored in designated locations. As per regulations, non-recyclable hazardous waste is sent to a State Pollution Control Board (SPCB)- approved common treatment, storage, and disposal facility (TSDF) for proper management. We recognise the importance of waste segregation from the initial stages, and our control measures ensure that relevant information is tracked until the final disposal stage.\n\nAdditionally, the non-hazardous waste generated at our premises comprises of scrap metal, wood, glass, tires, e-waste, cardboard, and paper are sold via auctioned.\n\n- 4. Whether Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) is applicable to the entity's activities (Yes / No). If yes, whether the waste collection plan is in line with the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) plan submitted to Pollution Control Boards? If not, provide steps taken to address the same.\n\nOwing to the nature of the Company's product/service offerings, EPR is not applicable to the Company.",

Describe the measures taken by the entity to ensure a safe and healthy workplace.\n\nHealth and Safety of our people is of utmost importance to us. To achieve this, we have adopted a shared responsibility approach, with increased engagements at all levels of workforce and strengthening the safety culture across all Company's site/locations. We are taking steps to reduce reportable incidents, minimize injuries and regularly monitor the safety performance of our sites.\n\nOur occupational health and safety management system is also well aligned with Group's Safety framework and covers all employees, contractors, business associates, visitors and the community as well. In addition to that, a number of our sites across all Company's businesses are ISO 45001 (2018) certified.\n\nAs a part of our strategy to prevent health and safety related incidents, we have identified two focus areas which are contractor safety management (CSM) and operational discipline. CSM procedure provides support in manpower deployment whereas the operational discipline ensures that proper measures to eliminate hazards are taken at all our sites. Contractor Safety Management is well defined six step processes viz Pre-qualification - To Identify contractors compatible with owner operating safety principles, Contract Preparation - Develop contract package with specific language in the generic documents to clarify safety expectations for contracting needs, Contract Award - for effective review of contract safety specifications at bid meetings & pre-award meetings, Orientation & Training - 3 different level Safety Orientation (Generic, Area specific & Job Specific) Training with assessment, Managing the work (Safety Risk Field Audit (SRFA) with KPIs, Periodic / Contract closure evaluation. We have sets out requirement for evaluating and rewarding Contractors to ensure safety at the workplace. It will further result in development of an incident free work environment, by creating a systematic approach to manage contractors and making them aware of the risks associated with working on site.\n\nAll our employees and contractors are provided with appropriate PPEs and it is ensured that they are not negligent in using them. We are providing job related training to our employees to perform given task safely along with display of do's and don'ts at prominent locations of the sites. Beside this, we have stringent work permit system in place. Toolbox talks, task briefing, job specific training, job hazard analysis and mock drill help us in building safety culture within our sites/locations.\n\nMental and emotional health is a core part of our work culture. In view of this, an emotional wellness program was launched as part of Adani Care- Our integrated suite of health and well-being services and support platform. As an inclusive health service, the program offers professional and confidential counselling for our employees. Family member of our employee can also avail these services at any time of the day and in any location.\n\nWe also have various rewards and recognition programs in place to appraise the champions of safety working at Company's sites/locations.\n\n## 13.

Has the entity implemented a mechanism for Zero Liquid Discharge? If yes, provide details of its coverage and implementation.\n\nWater is a crucial resource required for the running our power plants. Therefore, acknowledging this resource's importance, we have established strict measures for water conservation at each of our power plants and have optimized our systems to reduce water consumption. Currently, we reuse 100% of the treated Wastewater in hinterland plants. We ensure compliance with the applicable statutory conditions laid by Ministry of Environment, Forest & Climate Change / Central and State Pollution Control Board for locations, where zero discharge is mandated. In sea water based power plants, we have mechanism in place to treat the sewage/effluent as per the statutory limits before discharging back.\n\n## 6.

Kowa supported APL by conducting a global survey of hydrogen and ammonia-related technologies being utilised for power generation. IHI Corporation has already successfully demonstrated its ammonia co-firing technology at a large-scale commercial coal-fired power plant in Japan and responded to many inquiries related to ammonia co-firing globally.\n\nTo  achieve de-carbonization of APL's coal-fired assets, the parties, by considering the possibility of ammonia co-firing  through  the  studies,  aim  to  de-carbonize  APL's  coal  fired  assets  with  the  objective  to  potentially implement the technology in other coal-fired units within India.",

Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy adopted by your company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes and the practices adopted to manage such wastes.\n\nThe Company has defined processes for managing waste at each of its sites/locations. We follow the basic principle of segregation of the waste at source & adopt the 3R concept of 'reduce, reuse & recycle'.\n\nThe hazardous wastes are handled, segregated, stored and transported in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements and best industry practices. The hazardous waste is disposed of in an environmentally sound manner through authorized vendors for recycling as required by regulation.\n\nApart from hazardous waste, the most significant types of non-hazardous waste streams include scrap metal, wood waste, glass, tires, e-waste, cardboard and paper. Our strategic intent is to eliminate or reduce the generation of waste to divert waste from disposal through reuse and recycling wherever possible. All our site/ locations are working towards achieving Zero waste to landfill certification wherever feasible.\n\n## 11.

Pending  adjudications  /  outcome  of  the investigations by the Securities and Exchange Board of India as stated therein, we are unable to comment on the possible consequential effects thereof, if any, on the standalone  financial  statements.  Our  audit  opinion  for the year ended March 31, 2023 was also modified for the above and other matter.\n\nWe  conducted  our  audit  of  the  standalone  financial statements  in  accordance  with  the  Standards  on Auditing  (SAs),  as  specified  under  section  143(10)  of\n\nthe Act. Our responsibilities under those Standards are further described in the 'Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit  of  the  Standalone  Financial  Statements'  section of  our  report.  We  are  independent  of  the  Company in  accordance  with  the  'Code  of  Ethics'  issued  by  the Institute  of  Chartered  Accountants  of  India  together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements under the provisions of the Act and the Rules thereunder, and we have fulfilled our  other  ethical  responsibilities  in  accordance  with these requirements and the Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our qualified audit opinion on the standalone financial statements.\n\n## Key Audit Matters\n\nKey  audit  matters  are  those  matters  that,  in  our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit  of  the  standalone  financial  statements  for  the financial year ended March 31, 2024. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the standalone financial  statements  as  a  whole,  and  in  forming  our opinion  thereon,  and  we  do  not  provide  a  separate opinion  on  these  matters.  In  addition  to  the  matter described in the 'Basis for Qualified Opinion' section we have determined the matters described below to be the key audit matters to be communicated in our report. For each matter below, our description of how our audit addressed the matter is provided in that context.\n\nWe  have  fulfilled  the  responsibilities  described  in  the Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the standalone financial statements section of our report, including in relation to these matters. Accordingly, our audit included the performance of procedures designed to respond to our assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the standalone financial statements. The results of our audit procedures, including the procedures performed to  address  the  matters  below,  provide  the  basis  for our  audit  opinion  on  the  accompanying  standalone financial statements.",

The invoices for change in law claims are raised considering operational / cost parameters based on qualitative parameters approved in  terms  of  the  relevant  Regulatory  Authorities  Orders and  are  subject  to  partial/  final  acceptance  of  the claims by the respective Discoms. Considering that the methodology and the parameters of claims are subject to final acceptance by the respective Discoms, the revenue is  recognised  in  the  books  of  account  based  on  the prudent parameters and methodology, till the respective matters are accepted / settled with the Discoms.\n\nThus, the revenue/ receivables from Discoms are subject to adjustments to the extent there may be adverse impact on account of appeals with the regulatory authorities.\n\nIn  certain  cases  where  the  regulatory  order(s)  are subject matter of appeal with higher appellate forums / authorities, and the amount of claims are not ascertainable, revenues for change in law claims are not recognised, pending outcome of the final decision.\n\nIn  view  of  the  complexity  and  judgement  involved in  estimation  of  the  amounts  of  such  claims  and recoverability thereof, the same is considered as a key audit matter.\n\nOur audit procedures in response to this key audit matter included, but not limited to, the following:\n\n- -Examined the Company's accounting policies with respect to assessing compliance with Ind AS 115 'Revenue from Contract with Customers'.\n- -Obtained understanding of the key controls that management has in place to monitor change in law events and related claims, status of various pending claims including under appeals and orders passed by various regulatory authorities and tested those key controls.\n- -Inspected the relevant state regulatory commission, CERC,  appellate  tribunal  and  court  rulings  and examined  management  assumptions  /  judgement relating to various parameters in terms of regulatory orders, for measuring / estimating the amount of such claims.\n- -Examined the underlying parameters and assumptions  /  judgement  used  for  measuring  / computing  the  amounts  of  compensation  claims as  per  regulatory  orders  through  verification  of historical information and other available internal and external data.\n- -Tested  on  sample  basis,  the  accuracy  of  the underlying  data  used  for  computation  of  such claims.\n- -Tested the joint reconciliations for trade receivables performed  by  the  Company  with  the  respective Discoms, wherever available with underlying records.\n- -Tested the status of the outstanding receivables and recoverability of the overdue / aged receivables through inquiry with management, and collection trends in respect of receivables.\n- -Assessed the disclosures in accordance with the requirements of Ind AS 115 'Revenue from Contract with Customers'.",

As the Company is entitled to tariff based on actual cost incurred for the year, at point of revenue recognition it recognises adjustments for the escalation/ de-escalation in  the  various  parameters  compared  to  the  entitled parameters.\n\nAccruals are determined based on tariff regulations and past  tariff  orders  and  are  subject  to  verification  and approval by the regulators. Further the costs incurred are subject to prudential checks and the prescribed norms. Significant  judgements  are  made  in  determining  the accruals  including  interpretation  of  tariff  regulations. Further certain matters for disallowance of claims have been litigated by the Company before higher authorities.\n\nRevenue recognition and accrual of regulatory claims is a key audit matter considering the significant judgements involved in the determination thereof.\n\nOur audit procedures in response to this key audit matter included, but not limited to, the following:\n\n- -Examined the Company's accounting policies with respect to assessing compliance with Ind AS 115 'Revenue from Contract with Customers'.\n\n-\n\n-\n\n- Performed test of controls over revenue recognition and  accruals  through  inspection  of  evidence  of performance of these controls.\n- Performed  the  tests  of  details,  on  sample  basis, including the following key procedures:\n- y Evaluated  the  key  assumptions  used  by  the Company by comparing it with the assumptions in provisional approved tariff order.\n- y For tariff orders (including updated tariff order) received by the Company, assessed the impact recognised by the Company and for matters litigated  by  the  Company,  also  assessed  the management's evaluation of the likely outcome of the dispute based on past precedents.\n- y Examined the underlying parameters for measuring / computing the claims and verified the working as per CERC regulatory orders.\n- -Tested the status of the outstanding receivables and recoverability of the overdue / aged accruals through inquiry with management, and collection trends in respect of receivables.\n- -Assessed the disclosures in accordance with the requirements of Ind AS 115 'Revenue from Contract with Customers'.",

The other information comprises the information included in the Annual report, but does not include  the  standalone  financial  statements  and  our auditor's report thereon.\n\nOur opinion on the standalone financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nIn connection with our audit of the standalone financial statements,  our  responsibility  is  to  read  the  other information and, in doing so, consider whether such other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is  a  material  misstatement  of  this  other  information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n## Responsibilities  of  the  Management  and  Those Charged  with  Governance  for  the  Standalone Financial Statements\n\nThe Company's Board of Directors is responsible for the matters stated in section 134(5) of the Act with respect to the preparation of these standalone financial statements that give a true and fair view of the financial position, financial  performance  including  other  comprehensive income, cash flows and changes in equity of the Company in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted  in  India,  including  the  Indian  Accounting Standards  (Ind  AS)  specified  under  section  133  of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended. This responsibility also  includes  maintenance  of  adequate  accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding of the assets of the Company and for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection  and  application  of  appropriate  accounting policies;  making  judgments  and  estimates  that  are reasonable and prudent; and the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls, that were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the standalone financial statements that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing  the  standalone  financial  statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either  intends  to  liquidate  the  Company  or  to  cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\nThose Charged with Governance are also responsible for overseeing the Company's financial reporting process.\n\n## Auditor's  Responsibilities  for  the  Audit  of  the Standalone Financial Statements\n\nOur  objectives  are  to  obtain  reasonable  assurance about  whether  the  standalone  financial  statements  as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes  our  opinion.  Reasonable  assurance  is  a  high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can  arise  from  fraud  or  error  and  are  considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably  be  expected  to  influence  the  economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these standalone financial statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n\n- \u0083 Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of  the  standalone  financial  statements,  whether due  to  fraud  or  error,  design  and  perform  audit procedures  responsive  to  those  risks,  and  obtain audit  evidence  that  is  sufficient  and  appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions,  misrepresentations,  or  the  override  of internal control.\n- \u0083 Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Under section 143(3)(i)  of  the  Act,  we  are  also  responsible  for expressing our opinion on whether the Company has adequate internal financial controls with reference to financial statements in place and the operating effectiveness of such controls.",

If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report  to  the  related  disclosures  in  the  financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our  auditor's  report.

We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter  or  when,  in  extremely  rare  circumstances,  we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\n\n## Report  on  Other  Legal  and  Regulatory Requirements\n\n- 1. As  required  by  the  Companies  (Auditor's  Report) Order,  2020  ('the  Order'),  issued  by  the  Central Government of India in terms of sub-section (11) of section 143 of the Act, we give in the 'Annexure 1' a statement on the matters specified in paragraphs 3 and 4 of the Order.\n- 2.

These  responsibilities include the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that were operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct of  its  business,  including  adherence  to  the  Company's policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable financial information, as required under the Companies Act, 2013.\n\n## Auditor's Responsibility\n\nOur  responsibility  is  to  express  an  opinion  on  the Company's  internal  financial  controls  with  reference to these standalone financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over  Financial  Reporting  (the  'Guidance  Note')  and the  Standards  on  Auditing,  as  specified  under  section 143(10) of the Act, to the extent applicable to an audit of  internal  financial  controls,  both  issued  by  ICAI. Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether adequate  internal  financial  controls  with  reference  to these standalone financial statements was established and maintained and if such controls operated effectively in all material respects.\n\nOur  audit  involves  performing  procedures  to  obtain audit  evidence  about  the  adequacy  of  the  internal financial  controls  with  reference  to  these  standalone financial statements and their operating effectiveness. Our  audit  of  internal  financial  controls  with  reference to  standalone  financial  statements  included  obtaining an  understanding  of  internal  financial  controls  with reference  to  these  standalone  financial  statements, assessing  the  risk  that  a  material  weakness  exists, and  testing  and  evaluating  the  design  and  operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.  The  procedures  selected  depend  on  the  auditor's judgement,  including  the  assessment  of  the  risks  of material  misstatement  of  the  standalone  financial statements, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nWe believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the Company's internal financial controls with reference to these standalone financial statements.\n\n## Meaning of Internal Financial Controls With Reference  to  these  Standalone  Financial Statements\n\nA  company's  internal  financial  controls  with  reference to standalone  financial statements  is  a  process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability  of  financial  reporting  and  the  preparation  of standalone  financial  statements  for  external  purposes in  accordance  with  generally  accepted  accounting principles. A company's internal financial controls with reference to standalone standalone financial statements includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to  the  maintenance  of  records  that,  in  reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable  assurance  that  transactions  are  recorded as  necessary  to  permit  preparation  of  standalone financial  statements  in  accordance  with  generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance  with  authorisations  of  management  and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance  regarding  prevention  or  timely  detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the standalone financial statements.",

The carrying amount of any component accounted for as a separate asset is derecognised when replaced. All other repairs and maintenance are charged to  profit  or  loss  during  the  reporting  period in which they are incurred. Subsequent costs are depreciated over the residual life of the respective assets. The residual values, useful lives and methods of depreciation of property, plant  and  equipment  are  reviewed  at  each financial  year  end  and  adjusted  prospectively, if appropriate.\n\n## b Current versus non-current classification\n\nThe operating cycle is the time between the acquisition of assets for processing and their realisation  in  cash  and  cash  equivalents. The  Company  has  identified  twelve  months as its operating cycle for determining current and  non-current  classification  of  assets  and liabilities in the Balance sheet.\n\nDeferred Tax Assets and liabilities are classified as non-current assets and liabilities.\n\n## c Financial Instruments\n\nA  Financial  Instrument  is  any  contract  that gives  rise  to  a  financial  asset  of  one  entity and a financial liability or equity instrument of another entity.\n\nFinancial assets and financial liabilities are  initially  measured  at  fair  value  with  the exception  of  trade  receivables  that  do  not contain significant financing component or for which the Company has applied the practical expedient,  the  Company  initially  measures a  financial  asset  at  its  fair  value  plus,  in  the case  of  a  financial  asset  not  at  fair  value through  profit  or  loss,  the  transaction  cost. Transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of financial assets and financial liabilities (other than financial assets\n\nand  financial  liabilities  at  fair  value  through profit  or  loss)  are  added  to  or  deducted  from the fair value of the financial assets or financial liabilities, as appropriate, on initial recognition. Transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition  of  financial  assets  or  financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are recognised  immediately  in  the  statement  of profit and loss.\n\n## d Financial assets\n\n## Initial recognition and measurement\n\nAll regular way purchases or sales of financial assets are recognised and derecognised on a trade date basis i.e. the date that the Company commits  to  purchase  or  sell  the  assets. Purchases  or  sales  of  financial  assets  that require delivery of assets within a time frame established by regulation or convention in the market place (regular way trades).\n\n## Subsequent measurement\n\nAll recognised financial assets are subsequently measured in their entirety at either amortised cost or fair value, depending on the classification of the financial assets.\n\n## Classification of Financial assets\n\n## Financial assets measured at amortised cost\n\nFinancial  assets  that  meet  the  criteria  for subsequent  measurement  at  amortised  cost are measured using effective interest method ('EIR')  (except  for  debt  instruments  that  are designated  as  at  fair  value  through  profit  or loss on initial recognition).\n\nAmortised cost is calculated by taking into  account  any  discount  or  premium  on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the EIR.\n\n## Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVTOCI)\n\nFinancial assets that meet the criteria for initial recognition at FVTOCI are remeasured at fair value at the end of each reporting date through other comprehensive income (OCI).",

In  case  of  other  financial  assets, 12-month ECL is used to provide for impairment loss  and  where  credit  risk  has  increased, significantly, lifetime ECL is used.\n\n## Derecognition of financial assets\n\nOn  derecognition  of  a  financial  asset  in its entirety, the difference between  the asset's  carrying  amount  and  the  sum  of  the consideration  received  and  receivable  and the  cumulative  gain  or  loss  that  had  been recognised  in  other  comprehensive  income and accumulated in equity, is recognised in the statement of profit and loss if such gain or loss would have otherwise been recognised in the statement of profit and loss on disposal of that financial asset.\n\n## e Financial liabilities and equity instruments\n\n## Classification as debt or equity\n\nDebt  and  equity  instruments  issued  by  the Company  are  classified  as  either  financial liabilities or as equity in accordance with the substance  of  the  contractual  arrangements and the definitions  of  a  financial  liability  and an  equity  instrument.  Compound  financial instruments  are  separated  into  liability  and equity components  based  on  the  terms of the contract.\n\n## Instruments entirely equity in nature\n\nUnsecured  perpetual  securities  ('securities') are  the  securities  with  no  fixed  maturity  or redemption  and  the  same  are  callable  only at the option of issuer. These securities are ranked senior only to the equity share capital of the Company and the issuer does not have any redemption obligation hence these securities are recognised as equity as per Ind AS 32.\n\n## Financial liabilities\n\n## Initial recognition and measurement\n\nAll financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value and in the case of financial liabilities at amortised cost, net of directly attributable transaction costs.\n\n## Subsequent Measurement\n\nFor  purposes  of  subsequent  measurement, financial liabilities are classified under two categories:\n\n- y Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss\n- y Financial liabilities at amortised cost\n\n## Classification of Financial liabilities\n\n## Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL)\n\nFinancial liabilities at fair value through profit or  loss  include  financial  liabilities  held  for trading and financial liabilities designated upon initial recognition as fair value through profit or loss.  Financial  liabilities  are  classified  as  held for trading if these are incurred for the purpose of repurchasing in the near term. This category also  includes  derivative  financial  instruments entered  into  by  the  Company  those  are  not designated as hedging instruments in hedge relationships as defined by Ind AS 109.\n\nGains or losses on liabilities held for trading are recognised in the profit or loss.\n\nFinancial  liabilities  designated  upon  initial recognition at fair value through profit or loss are designated as such at the initial date of recognition, and only if the criteria in Ind AS 109 are satisfied.

The carrying amounts  of  financial liabilities that are subsequently measured at amortised cost are determined  based  on  the  effective  interest method. Interest expense that is not capitalised as part of costs of an asset is included in the 'Finance  costs'  line  item  in  the  statement  of profit and loss.\n\n## Derecognition of financial liabilities\n\nOn  derecognition,  the  difference  between the  carrying  amount  of  the  financial  liability derecognised  and  the  consideration  paid  / payable is recognised in the statement of profit and loss. In case of derecognition of financial liabilities  relating  to  promoters  contribution, the difference between the carrying amount of  the  financial  liability  derecognised and the consideration  paid  /  payable  is  recognised in other equity.\n\n## Offsetting of Financial Instruments\n\nFinancial  assets  and  financial  liabilities  are offset and the net amount is reported in the balance sheet if there is a legally enforceable right  (not  contingent  on  future  events)  to off-set the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, or to realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously.\n\n## Financial guarantee contracts\n\nFinancial  guarantee  contracts  issued  by  the Company  are  those  contracts  that  require  a payment to be made to reimburse the holder for  a  loss  it  incurs  because  the  specified debtor fails to make a payment when due in accordance with the terms of a debt instrument. Financial guarantee contracts are recognised initially  as  a  liability  at  fair  value  through profit  or  loss,  adjusted  for  transaction  costs\n\nthat are directly attributable to the issuance of  the  guarantee.  Subsequently,  the  liability is measured at the higher of the amount of loss allowance determined as per impairment requirements of Ind AS 109 and the amount recognised less cumulative amortisation.\n\n## f Derivative financial instruments\n\nThe Company enters into a variety of derivative financial  instruments  to  manage  its  exposure to interest rate and foreign exchange rate risks on borrowings / purchases, including foreign exchange  forward  contracts,  interest  rate swaps and cross currency swaps, Principal only Swap, coupon only swap etc. Further details of derivatives financial instruments are disclosed in note 47.\n\nDerivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the date the derivative contracts are entered into and are subsequently remeasured to their fair value at the end of each reporting period. Derivatives  are  carried  as  financial  assets when the fair value is positive and as financial liabilities  when  the  fair  value  is  negative. The  resulting  gain  or  loss  is  recognised  in the  statement  of  profit  and  loss  immediately, except for the effective portion of cash flow hedges, which is recognised in OCI and later reclassified to profit or loss.\n\n## g Hedge Accounting\n\nThe  Company  designates  certain  hedging instruments, which mainly includes derivatives in respect of foreign currency risk, as cash flow hedges.\n\nAt the inception of the hedge relationship, the Company documents the relationship between the  hedging  instrument  and  hedged  item, along  with  its  risk  management  objectives and its strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions.  Furthermore,  at  the  inception of  the  hedge  and  on  an  ongoing  basis,  the Company  documents  whether  the  hedging instrument  is  highly  effective  in  offsetting changes  in  fair  value  or  cash  flows  of  the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk.",

        "page_content": "## Notes to Standalone Financial Statements\n\nfor the year ended March 31, 2024\n\n## Cash flow hedges\n\nThe Company uses forward currency contracts as hedges of its exposure to foreign currency risk in forecast transactions and firm commitments.  The  Company  designates  only the spot element of a forward contract as a hedging  instrument.  The  forward  element is recognised in OCI. The ineffective portion relating to foreign currency  contracts  is recognised in finance costs.\n\n## h Investments in subsidiaries and associates\n\nInvestments in subsidiaries and associates are accounted for at cost, net of impairment, if any. (Also refer note 3(v)).\n\n## i Inventories\n\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realisable value after providing for obsolence and other losses where considered necessary. Costs  include  all  non-refundable  duties  and all charges incurred in bringing the goods to their present location and condition. Cost is determined on First in First out (FIFO) for coal inventory  and  on  weighted  average  basis for  other  than  coal  inventory.  Net  realisable value  represents  estimated  selling  price  of inventories and in case of coal inventory, it also includes the tariff price recoverable from supply of power generated from usage of coal less all estimated cost necessary to make the sale.\n\n## j Cash and cash equivalents\n\nCash and cash equivalent in the balance sheet comprise  cash  at  banks  and  on  hand  and short-term deposits with an original maturity of three months or less, that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.\n\nFor the purpose of the statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and short-term  deposits,  as  defined  above,  net of  outstanding  bank  overdrafts  as  they  are considered  an  integral  part  of  the  Company's cash management.\n\n## k Business combinations and Goodwill\n\nAcquisitions of business are accounted for using  the  acquisition  method  except\n\nbusiness combination under common control. The  consideration  transferred  in  a  business combination is measured at fair value, which is calculated as the sum of the acquisition date fair  values  of  the  assets  transferred  by  the Company, liabilities incurred by the Company to the former owners of the acquiree and the equity interest issued by the Company in exchange of control of the acquiree. Acquisition related costs  are  charged  to  the  statement  of  profit and loss for the periods in which the costs are incurred and the services are received, with the exception of the costs of issuing debt or equity securities that are recognised in accordance with Ind AS 32 and Ind AS 109.\n\nA  business  combination  involving  entities  or businesses under common control is a business combination  in  which  all  of  the  combining entities or businesses are ultimately controlled by the same party or parties both before and after the business combination and the control is  not  transitory.  The  transactions  between entities under common control are specifically covered  by  Ind  AS  103.  Such  transactions are accounted  for  using  the  pooling-ofinterest method. The assets and liabilities of the  acquired  entity  are  recognised  at  their carrying  amounts  of  the  Company's  financial statements.  No  adjustments  are  made  to reflect fair values or recognise any new assets or liabilities. The components of equity of the acquired  companies  are  added  to  the  same components  within  the  Company's  equity. The difference, if any, between the amounts recorded  as  share  capital  issued  plus  any additional consideration in the form of cash or other assets and the amount of share capital of  the  transferor  is  transferred  to  capital reserve and is presented separately from other capital reserves. The Company's shares issued in  consideration  for  the  acquired  companies are recognised from the moment the acquired companies  are  included  in  these  financial statements  and  the  financial  statements  of the  commonly  controlled  entities  would  be combined, retrospectively, as if the transaction had occurred at the beginning of the earliest reporting period presented.",

If the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than its carrying amount, the impairment loss  is  allocated  first  to  reduce  the  carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro rata based on the carrying amount of each asset in the unit. Any impairment loss for goodwill is  recognised  directly  in  statement  of  profit and  loss.  An  impairment  loss  recognised  for goodwill is not reversed in subsequent periods.\n\nOn  disposal  of  the  relevant  cash-generating unit,  the  attributable  amount  of  goodwill  is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.\n\n## l Foreign currency translations and transactions\n\nIn  preparing  the  financial  statements  of  the Company, transactions in currencies other than the entity's functional currency are recognised at the rate of exchange prevailing at the date of the transactions. At the end of each reporting period, monetary items denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing  at  that  date.  Non-monetary  items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated.\n\nExchange differences on monetary items are recognised  in  profit  and  loss  in  the  period in  which  they  arise  except  for  exchange differences  on  foreign  currency  borrowings relating to assets under construction for future productive use, which are included in the cost of those assets when they are regarded as an adjustment to interest costs on those foreign currency borrowings.\n\nThe  Company  has  elected  to  continue  the policy  adopted  for  accounting  for  exchange differences arising from translation of long-term  foreign  currency  monetary  items outstanding  and  recognised  in  the  financial statements for the period ending immediately before  the  beginning  of  the  first  Ind  AS financial reporting period i.e. March 31, 2016 as per the previous GAAP.\n\n## m Fair value measurement\n\nThe Company measures financial instruments, such as, derivatives and mutual funds at fair value at each balance sheet date.\n\nThe  Company's  management  determines  the policies  and  procedures  for  both  recurring fair  value  measurement,  such  as  derivative instruments  and  unquoted  financial  assets measured at fair value.\n\nThe Company uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for",

Where  Government  grants  relates  to non-monetary  assets,  the  cost  of  assets  is presented at gross value and grant significantly complied thereon is recognised as income in the statement of profit and loss over the useful life of the related assets in proportion in which depreciation is charged.\n\nGrants related to income are recognised in the statement of profit and loss in the same period as the related cost which they are intended to compensate are accounted for.\n\n## o Contract Balances\n\n## Contract assets\n\nA contract asset is the right to consideration in exchange for goods or services transferred to the customer. If the Company performs by transferring goods or services to a customer before  the  customer  pays  consideration  or before  payment  is  due,  a  contract  asset  is recognised for the earned consideration that is conditional. Contract assets are subject to impairment assessment.\n\n## Trade receivables\n\nA receivable represents the Company's right  to  an  amount  of  consideration  that  is unconditional i.e. only the passage of time is required before payment of consideration is due and the amount is billable. (refer note 3(viii))\n\n## Contract liabilities\n\nA contract liability is the obligation to transfer goods or services to a customer for which the Company has received consideration from the customer.  Contract  liabilities  are  recognised as  revenue  when  the  Company  performs obligations under the contract.\n\n## p Revenue recognition\n\nRevenue  from  contracts  with  customers  is recognised  when  control  of  the  goods  or services  are  transferred  to  the  customer  at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.\n\nRevenue is measured based on the transaction price,  which  is  the  consideration,  adjusted for discounts and other incentives, if any, as specified  in  the  contract  with  the  customer. Revenue also excludes taxes or other amounts collected from customers.\n\nThe disclosure of significant accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions relating to revenue  from  contracts  with customers are provided in Note 3 (vii).\n\nThe specific recognition criteria described below must also be met before revenue is recognised.",

The Company has concluded that revenue from sale of electricity  should  be  recognised  at  the point in time when electricity is transferred to the customer.\n\nRevenue  from  operations  on  account  of Force  Majeure  events  /  change  in  law events  in  terms  of  PPAs  /  SPPAs  with customers  (Power  Distribution  Utilities) is accounted for by the Company based on  the  orders  /  reports  of  Regulatory Authorities, best management estimates, wherever needed and reasonable certainty to expect ultimate collection.\n\nIn  case  of  PPA  under  section  62  of Electricity  Act,  2003,  revenue  from  sale of power is recognised based on the most recent tariff order approved by the CERC, as  modified  by  the  orders  of  Appellate Tribunal for Electricity ('APTEL'), to the  extent  applicable,  having  regard  to mechanism  provided  in  applicable  tariff regulations and the bilateral arrangements with the customers. Where the tariff rates are yet to be approved, provisional rates are  adopted  considering  the  applicable CERC Tariff Regulations.\n\n## ii) Sale of traded goods\n\nRevenue  from  the  sale  of  traded  goods is recognised at the point in time when control of the goods is transferred to the customers, which generally coincides with the delivery of goods.\n\n- iii) Carrying  cost  in  respect  of  claims  for change  in  law  of  taxes  and  duties, additional cost incurred on procurement of  alternative  coal  and  on  other  claims are recognised upon approval by relevant regulatory authorities, best management estimates and based on reasonable certainty to expect ultimate collection.\n- iv) Interest  income  is  recognised  on  time proportion basis at the effective interest rate ('EIR') applicable.\n- v) Late payment  surcharge  on  delayed payment for power supply is recognised based on receipt / collection from customers or on acceptance / acknowledgement by the customers whichever is earlier.\n\n## q Borrowing costs\n\nBorrowing  costs  directly  attributable  to  the acquisition,  construction  or  production  of qualifying  assets,  that  necessarily  take  a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale, are capitalised as part of the cost of the asset, until such time as the assets are substantially ready for their intended use  or  sale.  Interest  income  earned  on  the temporary  investment  of  specific  borrowings pending their expenditure on qualifying assets is deducted from the borrowing costs eligible for capitalisation.\n\nAll  other  borrowing  costs  are  recognised  in statement  of  profit  and  loss  in  the  period  in which they are incurred. Borrowing cost consist of  interest  and  other  costs  that  an  entity incurs  in  connection  with  the  borrowing  of funds. Borrowing cost also includes exchange differences  to  the  extent  regarded  as  an adjustment to the borrowing cost.\n\n## r Employee benefits\n\n## i) Defined benefit plans:\n\nThe Company has an obligation towards gratuity, a defined benefit retirement plan covering eligible employees (in some cases funded  through  Group  Gratuity  Scheme of  Life  Insurance  Corporation  of  India).

Remeasurement are not classified  to  statement  of  profit  and  loss in subsequent periods. Past service cost is recognised in statement of profit and loss in the period of a plan amendment.\n\n## ii) Defined contribution plan:\n\nRetirement  Benefits in the form of Provident Fund and Family Pension Fund which  are  defined  contribution  schemes are  charged  to  the  statement  of  profit and  loss  for  the  period  in  which  the contributions  to  the  respective  funds accrue as per relevant statues.\n\n## iii) Compensated Absences:\n\nProvision for Compensated Absences and  its  classifications  between  current and non-current liabilities are based on independent actuarial valuation.

That is, if the contract conveys the right to control  the  use  of  an  identified  asset  for  a period of time in exchange for consideration.\n\n## The Company as lessor\n\nThe determination of whether an arrangement is (or contains) a lease is based on the substance of  the  arrangement  at  the  inception  of  the lease. The arrangement is, or contains, a lease if  fulfilment  of  the  arrangement is dependent on the use of a specific asset or assets and the arrangement conveys a right to use the asset or assets, even if that right is not explicitly specified in an arrangement.\n\nLeases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all  the  risks  and  rewards  of  ownership  to the  lessee.  All  other  leases  are  classified  as operating leases.\n\nRental income  from  operating  leases is generally  recognised  on  a  straight-line  basis over the term of the relevant lease. Where the rentals are structured solely to increase in line with expected general inflation to compensate for  the  Company's  expected  inflationary  cost increases, such increases are recognised in the year in which such benefits accrue. Initial direct costs  incurred  in  negotiating  and  arranging an operating lease are added to the carrying amount of the leased asset and recognised on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n\n## The Company as lessee\n\nThe Company recognises right-of-use assets  and  lease  liabilities  for  all  leases except  for  short-term  leases  and  leases  of low-value assets.\n\nThe  Company  applies  the  available  practical expedients wherein it:\n\n- y Uses a single discount rate to a portfolio of leases with reasonably similar characteristics\n- y Relies on its assessment of whether leases are onerous immediately before the date of initial application\n- y Applies the short-term leases exemptions to leases with lease term that ends within 12 months at the date of initial application",

The lease payments include fixed  payments  (including  in  substance  fixed payments) less any lease incentives receivable, variable  lease  payments  that  depend  on  an index or a rate, and amounts expected to be paid under residual value guarantees. The lease payments  also  include  the  exercise  price  of a  purchase  option  reasonably  certain  to  be exercised  by  the  Company  and  payments  of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term  reflects  the  Company  exercising  the option to terminate. Variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or a rate are recognised  as  expenses  (unless  they  are incurred to produce inventories) in the period in which the event or condition that triggers the payment occurs.\n\n## Subsequent measurement of lease liability\n\nThe lease liability is remeasured when there is  change  in  future  lease  payments  arising from  a  change  in  an  index  or  a  rate,  or  a change  in  the  estimate  of  the  guaranteed residual value, or a change in the assessment of purchase, extension or termination option. When  the  lease  liability  is  measured,  the corresponding adjustment is reflected in the right-of-use asset.\n\n## t Taxes on Income\n\nTax  expenses  comprises  current  tax  and deferred  tax.  These  are  recognised  in  the statement  of  profit  and  loss  except  to  the extent that it relates to a business combination, or items recognised directly in equity or in other comprehensive income.\n\n## Current tax\n\nTax  on  income  for  the  current  period  is determined on the basis of estimated taxable income and tax credits computed in accordance with the provisions of the relevant tax laws and based on the expected outcome of  assessments  /  appeals.  Current  income tax assets and liabilities are measured at  the  amount  expected  to  be  recovered from  or  paid  to  the  taxation  authorities. Management periodically evaluates positions taken  in  the  tax  returns  with  respect  to situations in which applicable tax regulations are subject to interpretation and establishes provisions where appropriate.\n\nCurrent income tax relating to items recognised outside  profit  or  loss  is  recognised  outside profit  or  loss  (either  in  other  comprehensive income  or  in  equity).  Current  tax  items  are recognised  in  correlation  to  the  underlying transaction either in OCI or directly in equity.

Deferred  tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences except when the deferred tax liability arises at the time of transaction that affects  neither  the  accounting  profit  or  loss nor taxable profit or loss. Deferred tax assets are  generally  recognised  for  all  deductible temporary differences, carry forward of unused tax credits and any unused tax losses, to the extent that it is probable that future taxable income  will  be  available  against  which  the deductible  temporary  differences  and  carry forward  of  unused  tax  credit  and  unused tax  losses  can  be  utilised,  except  when  the deferred  tax  asset  relating  to  temporary differences arising at the time of transaction affects neither the accounting profit or loss nor the taxable profit or loss. Deferred tax relating to  items  recognised  outside  the  statement of  profit  and  loss  is  recognised  outside  the statement  of  profit  and  loss,  either  in  other comprehensive  income  or  directly  in  equity. The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient  taxable  profit  will  be  available  to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be utilised. Unrecognised deferred tax assets are re-assessed at each reporting date and are recognised to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profits will allow the deferred tax assets to be recovered.\n\nDeferred  tax  relating  to  items  recognised outside  profit  or  loss  is  recognised  outside profit  or  loss  (either  in  other  comprehensive income or in equity). Deferred tax items are recognised  in  correlation  to  the  underlying transaction either in OCI or directly in equity.\n\nThe Company offsets deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities if and only if it has a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets and  current  tax  liabilities  and  the  deferred tax  assets  and  deferred  tax  liabilities  relate\n\nto income taxes levied by the same taxation authority  on  the  same  taxable  entity  which intend either to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis, or to realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously, in each future period in which significant amounts of deferred tax liabilities or assets are expected to be settled or recovered.\n\nWhen there is uncertainty regarding income tax treatments, the Company assesses whether a tax authority is likely to accept an uncertain tax treatment. If it concludes that the tax authority is unlikely to accept an uncertain tax treatment, the  effect  of  the  uncertainty  on  taxable income, tax bases and unused tax losses and unused tax credits is recognised. The effect of the uncertainty is recognised using the method that, in each case, best reflects the outcome of the uncertainty: the most likely outcome or the expected value. For each case, the Company evaluates whether to consider each uncertain tax  treatment  separately,  or  in  conjunction with  another  or  several  other  uncertain  tax treatments, based on the approach that best prefixes the resolution of uncertainty.\n\n## u Earnings per share\n\nBasic  earnings  per  share  is  computed  by dividing  the  profit  /  (loss)  after  tax  (net  off distribution  on  Perpetual  Securities  whether declared  or  not)  by  the  weighted  average number  of  equity  shares  outstanding  during the year. Diluted earnings per share is computed  by  dividing  the  profit  /  (loss)  after tax (net off distribution on Perpetual Securities whether declared or not) as adjusted for the effects of dividend, interest and other charges relating to the dilutive potential equity shares by  weighted  average  number  of  shares  plus dilutive potential equity shares.\n\n## v Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets\n\nThe amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present obligation at the end of the reporting period, taking into account the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation.",

The contingent liabilities are disclosed where it is management's assessment that the outcome of any litigation and other claims against the Company  is  uncertain  or  cannot  be  reliably quantified, unless the likelihood of an adverse outcome is remote.\n\nContingent  assets  are  not  recognised  but are disclosed in the notes where an inflow of economic benefits is probable.\n\nA contingent liability recognised in a business combination  is  initially  measured  at  its  fair value.  Subsequently,  it  is  measured  at  the higher of the amount that would be recognised in accordance  with  the  requirements  for provisions above  or  the  amount  initially recognised less, when appropriate, cumulative amortisation  recognised  in  accordance  with the requirements for revenue recognition.\n\n## w Impairment of non-financial assets\n\nThe Company assess, at each reporting date whether  there  is  any  indication  that  assets may be impaired. If any such indication exists, the Company estimates the asset's recoverable amount. An asset's recoverable amount is the higher  of  an  asset's  or  cash-generating  unit ('CGU') fair value less costs to disposal and its value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their  present  value  using  a  pre-tax  discount rate that reflects current market assessments of  the  time  value  of  money  and  the  risks specific to the asset.\n\nIn assessing value in use, the estimated future cash  flows  are  discounted  to  their  present values  using  a  pre-tax  discount  rate  that\n\nreflects  current  market  assessment  of  the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. In determining fair value less cost of disposal, recent market transactions are taken into account. If no such transactions can be identified,  an  appropriate  valuation  model  is used. These calculations are corroborated by valuation  multiples,  quoted  share  prices  for publicly  traded  companies  or  other  available fair value indicators.\n\nThe  Company  enters  into  transaction  with suppliers that involves prepayment in conjunction  with  advances  for  goods  and services  wherein  the  Company  assesses  at each  reporting  date  whether  goods  against the advance is recoverable and if there is any indication, the asset may be provided.\n\nGoodwill is tested for impairment annually and when circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired.\n\nThe Company bases its impairment calculation on detailed budget and forecast calculations, which  are  prepared  separately  for  each  of the  Company's  cash-generating  unit  to  which the individual assets are allocated. For longer periods, a long-term growth rate is calculated and  applied  to  project  future  cash  flows. To  estimate  cash  flow  projections  beyond periods covered by the most recent budget / forecasts,  the  Company  estimates  cash  flow projections based on estimated growth rate.\n\nIf  the  recoverable  amount  of  an  asset  (or cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised immediately in the statement of profit and loss.\n\n## x Mine Development Expenditure :\n\n- i) Expenditure incurred towards coal mines under  construction  are  capitalised  to 'Coal Mines under construction' as long as they meet the capitalisation criteria and is presented as capital work-in-progress.

These costs are updated annually during the life of the mine to reflect the developments in mining activities. The mine closure obligations are included in Mining  Rights  under  Intangible  assets  and amortised based on unit of production method.\n\n## 3 Significant accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions\n\nThe preparation of the Company's financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities, and the accompanying disclosures, and the disclosure of contingent liabilities. The estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant. The  estimates  and  underlying  assumptions  are reviewed  on  an  ongoing  basis  and  any  revisions thereto  are  recognised  in  the  period  of  revision and future periods if the revision affects both the current  and  future  periods.  Uncertainties  about these  assumptions  and  estimates  could  result  in outcomes that require a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets or liabilities affected in future periods.\n\n## Key Sources of estimation uncertainty :\n\nThe  key  assumptions  concerning  the  future  and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the reporting date, that have a significant risk of causing a  material  adjustment  to  the  carrying  amounts of  assets  and  liabilities  within  the  next  financial year, are described below. Existing circumstances and assumptions about future developments may\n\nchange due to market changes or circumstances arising that are beyond the control of the Company. Such  changes  are  reflected  in  the  assumptions when they occur.\n\n## i) Useful lives of property, plant and equipment\n\nIn case of the power plant equipments, where the life of the assets has been estimated at 25 years based on technical assessment, taking into account the estimated usage of the asset and  the  current  operating  condition  of  the asset,  depreciation  on  the  same  is  provided based on the useful life of each component based  on  technical  assessment,  if  materially different from that of the main asset.\n\n## ii) Fair value measurement of financial instruments\n\nIn estimating the fair value of financial assets and  financial  liabilities,  the  Company  uses market observable data to the extent available. Where such Level 1 inputs are not available, the Company establishes appropriate valuation techniques and inputs to the model. The inputs to  these  models  are  taken  from  observable markets where possible, but where this is not feasible, a degree of judgement is required in establishing  fair  values.  Judgements  include considerations  of  inputs  such  as  liquidity risk,  credit  risk  and  volatility.  Changes  in assumptions about these factors could affect the reported fair value of financial instruments. Information  about  the  valuation  techniques and  inputs  used  in  determining  the  fair value  of  various  assets  and  liabilities  are disclosed in note 51.\n\n## iii) Defined benefit plans (gratuity benefits)\n\nThe  cost  of  the  defined  benefit  gratuity  plan and the present value of the gratuity obligation are  determined  using  actuarial  valuations. An actuarial valuation involves making various assumptions  that  may  differ  from  actual developments  in  the  future.  These  include the determination of the discount rate, future salary increases and mortality rates. Due to the complexities involved in the valuation and its long-term nature, a defined benefit obligation is highly sensitive to changes  in  these",

Information  about the various estimates and assumptions made in  determining  the  present  value  of  defined benefit obligations are disclosed in note 55.\n\n## iv) Impairment of non financial assets\n\nFor determining whether property, plant and equipments  and  goodwill  are  impaired,  it requires an estimation of the value in use of the relevant cash generating units. The value in use calculation is based on a Discounted Cash  Flow  model  over  the  estimated  useful life  of  the  Power  Plants.  Further,  the  cash flow projections are based on estimates and assumptions relating to tariff, change in law claims, operational performance of the Plants, life extension plans, market prices of coal and other  fuels,  exchange  variations,  inflation, terminal  value  etc.  which  are  considered reasonable by the Management. (refer note 46).\n\n## v) Impairment of Investments made / Loans given to subsidiaries\n\nIn case  of  investments  made  and  loans given  by  the  Company  to  its  subsidiaries, the  Management  assesses  whether  there  is any indication of impairment in the value of investments and loans.

(Also refer note 8)\n\nDeferred tax assets are recognised for unused tax losses to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the losses can be utilised.

Post acquisition of the additional land, the management will update the estimate and assumption of the original completion plan of the assets. Further, given that demand of power is expected to be higher compared with generation capacity available in the industry, the development of asset forming part of Capital Work-InProgress will have economic viability for the Company. Further, in Current year the company is in advance stage in obtaining final approval of South East Central Railways to carry out development activities for the siding project.

In terms of the same, the Raipur TPP (the entity stand merged with the Company) has availed exemptions of duty of customs and excise duty upon submission of bank guarantees worth ' 960.01 crore and pledge of margin money deposits of ' 59.67 crore. The grant of final Mega power status of Raipur TPP is dependent upon plant achieving tie up for supply of power for 70% of its installed capacity through long term Power Purchase Agreements by way of competitive bidding and the balance through regulated market within stipulated time. The time period to achieve tie up for supply of power as prescribed in Mega Power Policy has been further extended to 156 months from the date of Import, till September 12, 2024, by the Ministry of Power, Government of India vide amendment dated April 07, 2022. The Management expects to comply the conditions and hence no adjustments are made in the books.\n- (c) In case of Raipur TPP, the Company had entered into a bulk power transmission agreement ('BPTA') with Power Grid Corporation of India Limited ('PGCIL') dated March 31, 2010 as per which the Company was granted Long term Access ('LTA') of 816 MW. However, owing to nonavailability of PPA, which as per management is beyond the control of the Company, Raipur TPP was not in a position to utilise the LTA and has accordingly sought for surrender of the LTA, for which PGCIL has raised demand of ' 154.50 crore towards relinquishment charges on the Company. However, the said claim will be subject to the outcome of the petition dated September 07, 2020 filed by the Company before the APTEL. Presently, the Company has taken legal opinion in the matter as per which there are force majure events and other factors as per which it is not liable to pay charges.\n- 2) For the Company's Udupi TPP and Tiroda TPP, matter on Custom Duty relating to March 2012 to February 2013 is contested at Customs, Excise and Service Tax Appellate Tribunal (\"CESTAT\").\n- 3) The  Central Sale Tax matter of Company's Mundra TPP relating to FY 2017-18, is contested at Commissioner Appeals.",

The Company has contested the said show cause notice. Further, the management is of the view that such duties on raw material are eligible to be made good to Mundra TPP under the PPA with Discoms or are refundable from the Authorities. Hence, the Company has not considered this as contingent liabilities.\n- iii) The Company has assessed that it is only possible, but not probable, that outflow of economic resources will be required in respect of above matters.\n\n## (b)  Commitments :\n\n| Particulars                                                                                                       | As at          | '  In crore As at   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|---------------------|\n|                                                                                                                   | March 31, 2024 | March 31, 2023      |\n| Estimated amount of contracts remaining to be executed on  capital account and not provided for (net of advances) | 11,484.93      | 7,809.65            |\n| Total                                                                                                             | 11,484.93      | 7,809.65            |\n\n## Note:\n\nCapital commitment mainly includes commitment relating to Flue Gas Desulphurisation project.\n\n## Other Commitment:\n\n- (i) The Company has given a commitment to lenders of Mahan Energen Limited (MEL) that it will not transfer its 49% equity holding in MEL outside the Adani Power Group, except with the prior approval of lenders.\n\n## 41  Leases\n\nThe Company has lease contracts for land, Building and computer hardware used in its operations.

The Nominated Authority vide its letter dated September 17, 2021, had accepted the surrender petition by the Company and ordered for invocation of bank guarantee along with obligation to fulfil antecedent liability. On September 29, 2021, the Hon'ble Delhi High Court, in response to petition filed by the Company, has stayed the invocation of the said performance bank guarantee and restrained the Nominated Authority from taking any coercive steps in the matter. The said Writ Petition is yet to be adjudicated by the Delhi High Court. Meanwhile, the Hon'ble Delhi High Court vide its order dated March 03, 2022, had directed the Nominated authority to return the said performance bank guarantee within one week from the date of execution of Letter of Intent of 'Coal Mines Production and Development Agreement' ('CMPDA') with a new bidder and to present the said CMPDA before the Delhi High Court. The Nominated Authority has concluded the fresh e-auction of Jitpur Coal Block on September 13, 2022. Pursuant to this, the CMDPA has been signed between the new bidder and the Nominated Authority, Ministry of Coal on October 13, 2022. The Nominated Authority is yet to submit CMPDA with new bidder with Delhi High Court in the matter.\n\nEarlier, the Company has submitted the details of costs / expenditure incurred towards development of mine with Nominated Authority, and based on allotment of mine to a new bidder, the Company expects a favourable resolution relating to cost realisation of Jitpur mine with Nominated Authority and for release of Performance Bank  Guarantee.  The  Company  has  also  obtained  legal  opinion  basis  which  it  is  reasonably  confident  to get compensation realised of the entire costs incurred towards the development of the coal mine in the subsequent period.\n\n- 44 The Company through erstwhile subsidiary, Raipur Energen Limited ('REL') has incurred cost of ' 55.57 crore and ' 30.75 crore towards development of Talabira Coal mine and Ganeshpura Coal mine, respectively in the earlier years.\n- In the above matter, earlier the Company had filed two writ petitions with Hon'ble Delhi High Court requesting surrender of the said mines in view of Union of India's ('UoI') notification dated April 16, 2015 stating capping of the fixed / capacity charges and also requested to refund the costs incurred along with the release of bid security. The Hon'ble Delhi High Court vide its single order dated April 15, 2019 dismissed the petitions on the ground of delay in filling of writ petitions. Consequently, the Company filed petitions before Hon'ble Supreme Court to set aside the order of the Hon'ble Delhi High Court. Pending adjudication of the petitions, Hon'ble Supreme Court directed UoI and others vide its order dated May 30, 2019 that no coercive action to be taken in these matters.\n\nThe management expects favourable resolution of these matters and is reasonably confident to realise the entire cost spent towards these coal mines as compensation in the subsequent periods.\n\nHowever, the matter has been pending for long period of time, the company based on prudence principles has fully provided the amount in the books for the purpose of financial reporting.\n\n- 45 The National Green Tribunal (\"NGT\") in a matter relating to non-compliance of environmental norms relating to Udupi thermal power plant ('Udupi TPP') directed the Company vide its order dated March 14, 2019, to make payment of ' 5.00 crore as an interim environmental compensation to Central Pollution Control Board (\"CPCB\"), which was deposited by the Company with CPCB under protest, in April 2019 and expensed the same in the books.\n\nNGT vide its order dated May 31, 2022 settled the matter and directed the Company to deposit an additional amount of ' 47.02 crore with CPCB within 3 months from the date of order. The Company has recognised expense provision of ' 47.02 crore in the books on a conservative basis, although, the Company has filed petition with the Hon'ble Supreme Court dated August 26, 2022 against the above referred NGT order. The Udupi TPP continues to operate in compliance with all the conditions under Environment Clearance as at reporting date.",

During the year, the Company has resumed supply of power to Haryana Discom and consequently has improved its operational performance in terms of achieving Higher Plant load factor (PLF) and generating positive operating cashflows, hence, based on the assessment of value in use of Mundra TPP, no provision / adjustment is considered necessary to the carrying value of its Mundra TPP related property, plant and equipment aggregating to ' 15,094.30 crore as at March 31, 2024.\n- (b)   The Company has determined the recoverable amounts of all its Thermal Power Plants (including goodwill allocated to respective Power Plants) over their useful lives based on the Cash Generating Units (\"CGUs\") identified, as required under Ind AS 36, Impairment of Assets on the basis of their Value in Use by estimating the future cash inflows over the estimated useful life of the Power Plants. Further, the cash flow projections are based on estimates and assumptions relating to tariff, operational performance of the Plants, availability of domestic coal under fuel supply agreement / coal linkage as per the directives of Competent Authority, life extension plans, market prices of coal and other fuels, exchange variations, inflation, terminal value etc. which are considered reasonable by the Management.\n- On a careful evaluation of the aforesaid factors, the Management of the Company has concluded that the recoverable value of such CGUs individually is higher than their respective carrying amounts as at March 31, 2024. However, if these estimates and assumptions were to change in future, there could be corresponding impact on the recoverable amounts of the Plants.\n- 47 The Company has taken various derivatives to hedge its risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations on items including principal loan amount, Trade Credits, Letter of Credits etc. and interest thereof along with interest rate changes.

The Management ensures appropriate risk governance framework for the Company through appropriate policies and procedures and the risks are identified, measured and managed in accordance with the Company's policies and risk objectives.\n\nThe Company's financial liabilities (other than derivatives) comprises mainly of borrowings including interest accrual, leases, trade, capital and other payables. The Company's financial assets (other than derivatives) comprise mainly of investments, cash and cash equivalents, other balances with banks, loans, trade and other receivables.\n\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Company is exposed to Market risk, Credit risk and Liquidity risk.\n\n## (i) Market risk\n\nMarket risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market prices. Market risk comprises three types of risk: interest rate risk, currency risk and commodity risk.\n\n## a) Interest rate risk\n\nInterest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates. The Company's exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates relates primarily to the part of Company's debt obligations with floating interest rates.\n\nThe  Company manages its interest  rate  risk  by  having  a  mixed  portfolio  of  fixed  and  variable  rate loans and borrowings.  Significant portion of Company's borrowing is in INR ( ' ) and are borrowed at fluctuating interest rate.\n\nThe sensitivity analysis have been carried out based on the exposure to interest rates for instruments not hedged against interest rate fluctuation at the end of the reporting period. The said analysis has been carried out on the amount of floating rate liabilities outstanding at the end of the reporting period. The year end balances are not necessarily representative of the average debt outstanding during the year. A 50 basis point increase or decrease represents management's assessment of the reasonably possible change in interest rates.\n\nIn case of fluctuation in interest rates by 50 basis points on the exposure of borrowings (having fluctuating rates i.e. exposed to changes in rates) of ' 19,700.00 crore as on March 31, 2024  and ' 20,735.47 crore as on March 31, 2023 respectively and if all other variables were held constant, the Company's profit or loss for the year would increase or decrease as follows:\n\n| Particulars                              |   For the year ended  March 31, 2024 |   '  In crore For the year ended  March 31, 2023 |\n|------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|\n| Impact on Profit before tax for the year |                                98.5  |                                           103.68 |\n| Impact on Equity                         |                                73.71 |                                           103.68 |\n\nThe Company intends to hold investment in liquid mutual fund for relatively shorter period and hence, interest rate risk is not material to that extent.\n\n## b) Foreign currency risk\n\nForeign currency risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of an exposure will fluctuate because  of  changes  in  foreign  exchange  rates.  The  Company's  exposure  to  the  risk  of  changes  in foreign exchange rates relates primarily to the Company's operating activities (Coal imports etc.) and borrowings. The Company manages its foreign currency risk by hedging transactions that are expected",

The Company also enters into various foreign exchange hedging contracts such as forward covers, swaps, options etc. to mitigate the risk arising out of foreign exchange rate movement on foreign currency borrowings and trade payables (including capital creditors).\n\nEvery one percentage point depreciation / appreciation in the exchange rate between the Indian rupee and U.S.dollar on the unhedged exposure of $ 227.72 million as on March 31, 2024 and $ 56.53 million as on March 31, 2023 would have affected the Company's profit or loss for the year as follows:\n\n| Particulars                                                                                                |   For the year ended  March 31, 2024 |   '  In crore For the year ended  March 31, 2023 |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|\n| Impact on Profit before tax for the year (net of amounts  capitalised under Property, Plant and Equipment) |                                18.99 |                                             4.65 |\n| Impact on Equity                                                                                           |                                14.21 |                                             4.65 |\n\n## c) Commodity price risk\n\nThe Company's exposure to commodity price is affected by a number of factors including the effect of regulations, the price volatility of coal prices in the market, including imported coal, contract size and length, market condition etc. which is moderated by optimising the procurement under fuel supply agreement and getting compensated under long term power purchase agreements and change in law regulations. In case, the company anticipates non-availability of coal, the same is mitigated by sourcing imported coal in advance to meet the demand. Its operating / trading activities require the on-going purchase for continuous supply of coal and other commodities. Therefore the Company monitors its purchases closely to optimise the procurement cost.\n\n## (ii)  Credit risk\n\nCredit risk is the risk that counterparty will not meet its obligations under a financial instrument or customer contract, leading to a financial loss.\n\n## a) Trade Receivables\n\nThe Company is having majority of receivables from State Electricity Boards which are Government undertakings and have interest clause on delayed payments and hence they are secured from credit losses in the future.\n\n## b) Financial Guarantee\n\nThe Company has issued financial guarantees to banks on behalf of and in respect of loan facilities availed by its subsidiaries. In accordance with the policy of the Company, the Company has recognised these financial guarantees as liability at fair value (refer note 23 and 29). Outstanding loans in the subsidiaries against the financial guarantee contracts given by the Company as at March 31, 2024 is ' 8,881.01 crore (Previous year ' 9,477.45 crore).\n\n## c) Other Financial Assets\n\nThis comprises of deposit with banks, loans, investments in mutual funds, derivative assets and other receivables. The company limits its exposure to credit risks arising from these financial assets and there is no collateral held against these because counter parties are group companies, banks and recognised financial institutions. Banks and recognised financial institutions have high credit ratings assigned by credit rating agencies.",

These models consider the maturity of its financial investments, committed funding and projected cash flows from operations. The Company's objective is to provide financial resources to meet its business objectives in a timely, cost effective and reliable manner and to manage its capital structure. A balance between continuity of funding and flexibility is maintained through internal accruals as well as adequately adjusting the working capital cycle.\n\nHaving regard to the nature of the business wherein the Company is able to generate regular cash flows over a period of time, any surplus cash generated, over and above the amount required for working capital management and other operational requirements, is retained as cash and cash equivalents (to the extent required) and any excess is invested in highly liquid mutual funds with appropriate maturities to optimise the cash returns on investments while ensuring sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities; or lent to group entities (within Adani Power Limited) at market determined interest rate.\n\nRead with note 50, the Company expects to generate positive cash flows from operations in order to meet its external financial liabilities as they fall due and also consistently monitors funding options available in the debt and capital market with a view to maintain financial flexibility.\n\n## Maturity profile of financial liabilities :\n\nThe table below has been drawn up based on the undiscounted contractual maturities of the financial liabilities including interest that will be paid on those liabilities upto the maturity of the instruments.\n\n' in crore\n\n| As at March 31, 2024              |                  |                   |               |                    |           |\n|-----------------------------------|------------------|-------------------|---------------|--------------------|-----------|\n|                                   | Carrying  Amount | Less than  1 year | 1 to  5 years | More than  5 years | Total     |\n| Borrowings (refer note 21 and 26) | 25,644.61        | 8,524.89          | 9,813.55      | 21,591.98          | 39,930.42 |\n| Trade Payables                    | 2,943.84         | 2,943.84          | -             | -                  | 2,943.84  |\n| Derivative Instruments            | -                | -                 | -             | -                  | -         |\n| Lease liabilities                 | 158.20           | 23.15             | 67.81         | 458.92             | 549.88    |\n| Other Financial Liabilities       | 898.81           | 647.97            | 111.55        | 176.17             | 935.69    |\n\n| As at March 31, 2023              | Carrying  Amount   | Less than  1 year   | 1 to  5 years   | More than  5 years   | Total     |\n|-----------------------------------|--------------------|---------------------|-----------------|----------------------|-----------|\n| Borrowings (refer note 21 and 26) | 32,806.35          | 10,405.88           | 22,459.49       | 13,833.80            | 46,699.17 |\n| Trade Payables                    | 2,387.38           | 2,387.38            | -               | -                    | 2,387.38  |\n| Derivative Instruments            | 7.04               | 7.04                | -               | -                    | 7.04      |\n| Lease liabilities                 | 96.51              | 15.06               | 47.28           | 308.94               | 371.28    |\n| Other Financial Liabilities       | 1,354.25           | 1,068.04            | 121.92          | 164.29               | 1,354.25  |",

Our  responsibilities  under  those  Standards  are  further described in the 'Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements' section of our report.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our qualified audit opinion on the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Key Audit Matters\n\nKey  audit  matters  are  those  matters  that,  in  our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit  of  the  consolidated  financial  statements  for  the financial year ended March 31, 2024. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial  statements  as  a  whole,  and  in  forming  our opinion  thereon,  and  we  do  not  provide  a  separate opinion  on  these  matters.  In  addition  to  the  matter described in the 'Basis for Qualified Opinion' section we have determined the matters described below to be the key audit matters to be communicated in our report. For each matter below, our description of how our audit addressed the matter is provided in that context.\n\nWe  have  fulfilled  the  responsibilities  described  in  the Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated financial statements section of our report, including in relation to these matters. Accordingly, our audit included the performance of procedures designed to respond to our assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements.

As the Company is entitled to tariff based on actual cost incurred for the year, at point of revenue recognition it recognises adjustments for the escalation/ de-escalation in  the  various  parameters  compared  to  the  entitled parameters.\n\nAccruals are determined based on tariff regulations and past  tariff  orders  and  are  subject  to  verification  and approval by the regulators. Further the costs incurred are subject to prudential checks and the prescribed norms. Significant  judgements  are  made  in  determining  the accruals  including  interpretation  of  tariff  regulations. Further certain matters for disallowance of claims have been litigated by the Company before higher authorities.\n\nRevenue recognition and accrual of regulatory claims is a key audit matter considering the significant judgements involved in the determination thereof.\n\n## Information Other than the Financial Statements and Auditor's Report Thereon (Other Information)\n\nThe Holding Company's Board of Directors is responsible for the  other  information.

The  respective  Board  of  Directors  of  the  company (ies)  included  in  the  Group  and  of  its  associate  are responsible for maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding of the assets of their respective company (ies) and for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that  are  reasonable  and  prudent;  and  the  design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial  controls,  that  were  operating  effectively for  ensuring  the  accuracy  and  completeness  of  the accounting  records,  relevant  to  the  preparation  and presentation of the consolidated financial statements that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement,  whether  due  to  fraud  or  error,  which have been used for the purpose of preparation of the consolidated financial  statements  by  the  Directors  of the Holding Company, as aforesaid.\n\nIn preparing the consolidated financial statements, the respective Board of Directors of the companies included in the Group and of its associate are responsible for assessing  the  ability  of  their  respective  company (ies)  to  continue  as  a  going  concern,  disclosing,  as applicable,  matters  related  to  going  concern  and using  the  going  concern  basis  of  accounting  unless management either intends to liquidate the respective company (ies) or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\nThose  Charged  with  Governance  of  the  respective companies included in the Group and of its associate are also  responsible  for  overseeing  the  financial  reporting process of their respective company (ies).\n\n## Auditor's  Responsibilities  for  the  Audit  of  the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether  the  consolidated  financial  statements  as  a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to  fraud  or  error,  and  to  issue  an  auditor's  report  that includes  our  opinion.  Reasonable  assurance  is  a  high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted  in  accordance  with  SAs  will  always  detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably\n\nbe  expected  to  influence  the  economic  decisions of  users  taken  on  the  basis  of  these  consolidated financial statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n\n- \u0083 Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of  the  consolidated  financial  statements,  whether due  to  fraud  or  error,  design  and  perform  audit procedures  responsive  to  those  risks,  and  obtain audit  evidence  that  is  sufficient  and  appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions,  misrepresentations,  or  the  override  of internal control.\n- \u0083 Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Under section 143(3)(i)  of  the  Act,  we  are  also  responsible  for expressing  our  opinion  on  whether  the  Holding Company  has  adequate  internal  financial  controls with reference to financial statements in place and the operating effectiveness of such controls.\n- \u0083 Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.\n- \u0083 Conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based  on  the  audit  evidence  obtained,  whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the ability of the Group and its associate to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the  consolidated  financial  statements  or,  if  such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our  conclusions  are  based  on  the  audit  evidence obtained  up  to  the  date  of  our  auditor's  report. However,  future  events  or  conditions  may  cause the Group and its associate to cease to continue as a going concern.\n- \u0083 Evaluate  the  overall  presentation,  structure  and content  of  the  consolidated  financial  statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated  financial  statements  represent  the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.",

These responsibilities include the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that were operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct of its business, including adherence to the respective company's policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable financial information, as required under the Companies Act, 2013.\n\n## Auditor's Responsibility\n\nOur responsibility is to express an opinion on the Holding Company's  internal  financial  controls  with  reference to  consolidated  financial  statements  based  on  our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance  Note  on  Audit  of  Internal  Financial  Controls Over  Financial  Reporting  (the  'Guidance  Note')  and the  Standards  on  Auditing,  specified  under  section 143(10) of the Act, to the extent applicable to an audit of  internal  financial  controls,  both,  issued  by  ICAI. Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform\n\nthe audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether adequate  internal  financial  controls  with  reference  to consolidated financial statements was established and maintained and if such controls operated effectively in all material respects.\n\nOur  audit  involves  performing  procedures  to  obtain audit  evidence  about  the  adequacy  of  the  internal financial controls with reference  to  consolidated financial statements and their operating effectiveness. Our  audit  of  internal  financial  controls  with  reference to consolidated financial statements included obtaining an  understanding  of  internal  financial  controls  with reference to consolidated financial statements, assessing  the  risk  that  a  material  weakness  exists, and  testing  and  evaluating  the  design  and  operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.  The  procedures  selected  depend  on  the  auditor's judgement,  including  the  assessment  of  the  risks  of material  misstatement  of  the  financial  statements, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nWe believe that the audit evidence we have obtained and the audit evidence obtained by the other auditors in terms of their reports referred to in the Other Matters paragraph below, is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Meaning of Internal Financial Controls With  Reference  to  Consolidated  Financial Statements\n\nA company's internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of  financial  reporting  and  the  preparation  of  financial statements  for  external  purposes  in  accordance  with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements includes those policies and procedures  that  (1)  pertain  to  the  maintenance  of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of  the  company;  (2)  provide  reasonable  assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally  accepted  accounting  principles,  and  that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorisations of management",

Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements to future periods are subject to the risk  that  the  internal  financial  controls  with  reference to  consolidated  financial  statements  may  become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\n## Opinion\n\nIn  our  opinion,  the  Group  and  its  associate  which are  companies  incorporated  in  India  whose  financial statements are audited, have, maintained in all material respects,  adequate  internal  financial  controls  with reference  to  consolidated  financial  statements  and\n\nsuch  internal  financial  controls  with  reference  to consolidated financial statements were operating effectively as at March 31, 2024, based on the internal control  over  financial  reporting  criteria  established by  the  Holding  Company  considering  the  essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note issued by the ICAI.\n\n## Other Matters\n\nOur  report  under  Section  143(3)(i)  of  the  Act  on  the adequacy and operating effectiveness of the internal financial controls with reference  to  consolidated financial  statements  of  the  Holding  Company,  in  so far  as  it  relates  to  these  ten  subsidiaries  which  are companies  incorporated  in  India,  is  based  on  the corresponding reports of the auditors of such subsidiaries incorporated in India.\n\n## For S R B C & CO LLP\n\nChartered Accountants\n\nICAI Firm Registration Number: 324982E/E300003\n\n## per Santosh Agarwal\n\nPartner\n\nMembership Number: 093669\n\nUDIN: 24093669BKFCGT2833\n\nPlace: Ahmedabad\n\nDate: May 1, 2024",

Information  on  the  Group's  structure  is provided in Note 41.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements were approved for issue in accordance with a resolution of the directors on May 01, 2024.\n\n## 2 Material accounting policies\n\n## 2.1  Basis of preparation\n\nThe consolidated financial statements of the Group have  been  prepared  in  accordance  with  Indian Accounting  Standards  (Ind  AS)  notified  under the  Companies  (Indian  Accounting  Standards) Rules,  2015  (as  amended  from  time  to  time)  read with  section  133  of  Companies  Act,  2013  and presentation requirements of Division II of schedule III  to  the  Companies  Act,  2013  (Ind  AS  compliant Schedule  III),  on  the  historical  cost  basis  except for certain financial instruments that are measured at  fair  values,  as  explained  in  the  accounting policies below.\n\nThe  Group's  consolidated  financial  statements are  presented  in  INR  ( ' ),  which  is  also  the  parent Company's  functional  currency  and  all  values\n\nare  rounded  to  the  nearest  crore,  except  when otherwise indicated.\n\n## 2.2  Basis of consolidation\n\n## Subsidiaries\n\nThe  consolidated  financial  statements  comprise the  financial  statements  of  the  Company  and its subsidiaries, being  the  entities  controlled by  it  as  at  March  31,  2024.  Control  is  achieved when the Company :\n\n- y has power over the investee;\n- y is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee; and\n- y has  the  ability  to  use  its  power  to  affect its returns\n\nThe Company reassesses whether or not it controls an  investee  if  facts  and  circumstances  indicate that there are changes to one or more of the three elements of control listed above.\n\nWhen the Company has less than a majority of the voting rights of an investee, it has power over the investee when the voting rights are sufficient to give it the practical ability to direct the relevant activities of the investee unilaterally. The Company considers all relevant facts and circumstances in assessing whether or  not  the  Company's  voting  rights  in  an investee are sufficient to give it power, including:\n\n- y the  size  of  the  Company's  holding  of  voting rights  relative  to  the  size  and  dispersion  of holdings of the other vote holders;\n- y potential voting rights held by the Company, other vote holders or other parties;\n- y rights arising from other contractual arrangements; and\n- y The  contractual  arrangement  with  the  other vote holders of the investee.\n\nConsolidation  of  a  subsidiary  begins  when  the Group  obtains  control  over  the  subsidiary  and ceases  when  the  Group  loses  control  of  the subsidiary. Assets, liabilities,  income and expenses of a subsidiary acquired or disposed of during the year  are  included  in  the  consolidated  financial statements from the date the Group gains control",

The  cash  flows  are  discounted  at  a  current pre-tax  rate  that  reflects  the  risks  specific  to the R&R liability. The unwinding of the discount as  well  as  payments  made/adjustments  is expensed as incurred cost and recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss. The estimated future costs of R&R are reviewed annually and adjusted as appropriate.\n\nAn  item  of  property,  plant  and  equipment and any significant part initially recognised is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected to arise from the continued use of the asset. Any gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an item of property, plant and equipment is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss.\n\nSubsequent  costs  are  included  in  the  asset's carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. The carrying amount of any component accounted for as a separate asset is derecognised when replaced. All other repairs and maintenance are charged to  profit  or  loss  during  the  reporting  period in  which  they  are  incurred.  Subsequent  costs are depreciated over the residual life of the respective assets. The residual values, useful lives and methods of depreciation of property, plant  and  equipment  are  reviewed  at  each financial  year  end  and  adjusted  prospectively, if appropriate.\n\n## b Investment property\n\n## Recognition and initial measurement\n\nInvestment properties are held to earn rentals  or  for  capital  appreciation,  or  both. Investment properties are measured initially at their cost of acquisition, including transaction\n\ncosts.  The  cost  comprises  purchase  price, borrowing  cost  if  capitalisation  criteria  are met and directly attributable cost of bringing the  asset  to  its  working  condition  for  the intended use. Any trade discount and rebates are deducted in arriving at the purchase price. Subsequent  costs  are  included  in  the  asset's carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that  future  economic  benefits  associated with the item will flow to the Group. All other repair and maintenance costs are recognised in  the  consolidated  statement  of  profit  and loss as incurred.\n\nThough the Group measures investment property  using  cost-based  measurement,  the fair value of investment property is disclosed in the notes. Fair values are determined based on  an  annual  valuation  performed  by  an accredited  external  independent  valuer  who holds a recognised and relevant professional qualification  and  has  recent  experience  in the location and category of the investment property being valued.\n\n## Subsequent measurement (depreciation and useful lives)\n\nDepreciation on investment properties is provided on the straight-line method, computed on  the  basis  of  useful  lives  prescribed  in Schedule II to the Companies Act, 2013. In case of leasehold properties, the same is depreciated over the lease period.\n\n## De-recognition\n\nInvestment properties are derecognised either when  they  have  been  disposed  of  or  when they are permanently withdrawn from use and no  future  economic  benefit  is  expected  from their disposal. The difference between the net disposal  proceeds  and  the  carrying  amount of the asset is recognised as other operating income in the consolidated statement of profit and loss in the period of de-recognition.\n\n## c Current versus non-current classification\n\nThe  operating  cycle  is  the  time  between  the acquisition of assets for processing and their realisation  in  cash  and  cash  equivalents.",

Compound financial instruments are separated into liability and equity components based on the terms of the contract.\n\n## Instrument entirely Equity in nature\n\nUnsecured  perpetual  securities  ('securities') are  the  securities  with  no  fixed  maturity  or redemption  and  the  same  are  callable  only at the option of issuer. These securities are ranked senior only to the equity share capital of the Company and the issuer does not have any redemption obligation hence these securities are recognised as equity as per Ind AS 32.\n\n## Financial liabilities\n\n## Initial recognition and measurement\n\nAll financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value and in the case of financial liabilities at amortised cost, net of directly attributable transaction costs.\n\n## Subsequent Measurement\n\nFor  purposes  of  subsequent  measurement, financial liabilities are classified under two categories:\n\n- y Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss\n- y Financial liabilities at amortised cost\n\n## Classification of Financial liabilities\n\n## Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL)\n\nFinancial liabilities at fair value through profit or  loss  include  financial  liabilities  held  for trading  and  financial  liabilities  designated upon initial recognition at fair value through profit or loss.

This category also includes derivative financial instruments entered into by the Group those are not designated as hedging instruments in hedge relationships as defined by Ind AS 109.\n\nGains or losses on liabilities held for trading are recognised in the profit or loss.\n\nFinancial  liabilities  designated  upon  initial recognition at fair value through profit or loss are designated as such at the initial date of recognition, and only if the criteria in Ind AS 109 are satisfied. Subsequent changes in fair value of liabilities are recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss.\n\nFair  values  are  determined  in  the  manner described in note 'n'.\n\n## Financial liabilities measured at amortised cost\n\nFinancial  liabilities that  are  not  held-fortrading  and  are  not  designated  as  at  FVTPL are measured at amortised cost at the end of subsequent accounting periods. The carrying amounts  of  financial liabilities that are subsequently measured at amortised cost are determined  based  on  the  effective  interest method.

Financial guarantee contracts are recognised initially  as  a  liability  at  fair  value  through profit  or  loss,  adjusted  for  transaction  costs that are directly attributable to the issuance of  the  guarantee.  Subsequently,  the  liability is measured at the higher of the amount of loss  allowance  determined  as  per  impairment requirements  of  Ind  AS  109  and  the  amount recognised less cumulative amortisation.\n\n## g Derivative financial instruments\n\nThe Group enters into a variety of derivative financial  instruments  to  manage  its  exposure to interest rate and foreign exchange rate risks on  borrowings  /  purchases,  including  foreign exchange  forward  contracts,  interest  rate swaps and cross currency swaps, Principal only Swap,  coupon  only  swap  etc.  Further  details of derivatives financial instruments are disclosed in note 52.\n\nDerivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the date the derivative contracts are entered into and are subsequently remeasured to their fair value at the end of each reporting period. Derivatives  are  carried  as  financial  assets when the fair value is positive and as financial liabilities  when  the  fair  value  is  negative. The  resulting  gain  or  loss  is  recognised  in the consolidated statement of profit and loss\n\nimmediately, except for the effective portion of  cash  flow  hedges,  which  is  recognised  in OCI  and  later  reclassified  to  the  consolidated statement of profit and loss.\n\n## h Hedge Accounting\n\nThe Group designates certain hedging instruments, which mainly includes derivatives in respect of foreign currency risk, as cash flow hedges.\n\nAt  the  inception  of  the  hedge  relationship, the Group formally designates and documents the relationship between the hedging instrument  and  hedged  item,  along  with  its risk  management  objectives  and  its  strategy for  undertaking  various  hedge  transactions. Furthermore,  at  the  inception  of  the  hedge and on an ongoing basis, the Group documents whether  the  hedging  instrument  is  highly effective in offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk.\n\n## Cash flow hedges\n\nThe Group uses forward currency contracts as hedges of its exposure to foreign currency risk in forecast transactions and firm commitments. The Group designates only the spot element of a  forward  contract  as  a  hedging  instrument. The forward element is recognised in OCI. The ineffective portion relating to foreign currency contracts is recognised in finance costs.\n\n## i Investments in associates\n\nThe  financial  statements  of  associates  are prepared  for  the  same  reporting  period  as the  Group.  The  accounting  policies  of  both companies are aligned with those of the Group. Therefore,  no  adjustments  are  made  when measuring and recognising the Group's share of the profit or loss of the investees after the date of acquisition.\n\nThe  Group's  investments  in  its  associate  is accounted  for  using  the  equity  method  of accounting  as  per  Ind  AS  28  'Investments  in Associates and Joint Ventures'. Under the equity method, on initial recognition, the investment in an associate is recognised at cost and the",

Costs  include  all  non-refundable  duties  and all charges incurred in bringing the goods to their present location and condition. Cost is determined on First in First out (FIFO) for coal inventory  and  on  weighted  average  basis for  other  than  coal  inventory.  Net  realisable value  represents  estimated  selling  price  of inventories and in case of coal inventory, it also includes the tariff price recoverable from supply of power generated from usage of coal less all estimated cost necessary to make the sale.\n\n## k Cash and cash equivalents\n\nCash and cash equivalent in the balance sheet comprise  cash  at  banks  and  on  hand  and short-term deposits with an original maturity of three months or less, that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.\n\nFor the purpose of the consolidated statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents consist of  cash  and  short-term  deposits,  as  defined above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts as they  are  considered  an  integral  part  of  the Group's cash management.\n\n## l Business combinations and Goodwill\n\nAcquisitions of business are accounted for using  the  acquisition  method  except business combination under common control. The  consideration  transferred  in  a  business combination is measured at fair value, which is calculated as the sum of the acquisition date fair values of the assets transferred by the Group, liabilities incurred by the Group to the former owners of the acquiree and the equity interest issued  by  the  Group  in  exchange  of  control of  the  acquiree.  Acquisition  related  costs  are\n\ncharged to the consolidated statement of profit and loss for the periods in which the costs are incurred and the services are received, with the exception of the costs of issuing debt or equity securities that are recognised in accordance with Ind AS 32 and Ind AS 109.\n\nA  business  combination  involving  entities  or businesses under common control is a business combination  in  which  all  of  the  combining entities or businesses are ultimately controlled by the same party or parties both before and after the business combination and the control is  not  transitory.  The  transactions  between entities under common control are specifically covered  by  Ind  AS  103.  Such  transactions are accounted  for  using  the  pooling-ofinterest method. The assets and liabilities of the  acquired  entity  are  recognised  at  their carrying  amounts  of  the  Company's  financial statements.  No  adjustments  are  made  to reflect fair values or recognise any new assets or liabilities. The components of equity of the acquired  companies  are  added  to  the  same components  within  the  Company's  equity. The  difference,  if  any,  between  the  amounts recorded  as  share  capital  issued  plus  any additional consideration in the form of cash or other assets and the amount of share capital of  the  transferor  is  transferred  to  capital reserve and is presented separately from other capital reserves. The Company's shares issued in  consideration  for  the  acquired  companies are recognised from the moment the acquired companies  are  included  in  these  financial statements  and  the  financial  statements  of the  commonly  controlled  entities  would  be combined, retrospectively, as if the transaction had occurred at the beginning of the earliest reporting period presented.\n\nPurchase  consideration  paid  in  excess  / shortfall of the fair value of identifiable assets and  liabilities  including  contingent  liabilities and  contingent  assets,  is recognised  as goodwill / capital reserve respectively, except in case where different accounting treatment is specified in the court / National Company Law Tribunal ('NCLT') approved scheme.",

If the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than its  carrying  amount,  the  impairment  loss  is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro rata based on the carrying amount of each asset in the unit. Any impairment loss for goodwill is recognised directly in the consolidated statement of profit and  loss.  An  impairment  loss  recognised  for goodwill is not reversed in subsequent periods.\n\nOn  disposal  of  the  relevant  cash-generating unit,  the  attributable  amount  of  goodwill  is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.\n\n## m Foreign currency translations and transactions\n\nIn  preparing  the  financial  statements  of  the Group,  transactions  in  currencies  other  than the entity's functional currency are recognised at the rate of exchange prevailing at the date of\n\nthe transactions. At the end of each reporting period, monetary items denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing  at  that  date.  Non-monetary  items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated.\n\nExchange differences on monetary items are recognised  in  profit  and  loss  in  the  period in  which  they  arise  except  for  exchange differences  on  foreign  currency  borrowings relating to assets under construction for future productive use, which are included in the cost of those assets when they are regarded as an adjustment to interest costs on those foreign currency borrowings.\n\nThe  Group  has  elected  to  continue  the policy  adopted  for  accounting  for  exchange differences arising from translation of long-term  foreign  currency  monetary  items outstanding  and  recognised  in  the  financial statements for the period ending immediately before  the  beginning  of  the  first  Ind  AS financial reporting period i.e. March 31, 2016 as per the previous GAAP.\n\n## n Fair value measurement\n\nThe  Group  measures  financial  instruments, such as, derivatives and mutual funds at fair value at each balance sheet date.\n\nThe  Group's  management  determines  the policies  and  procedures  for  both  recurring fair  value  measurement,  such  as  derivative instruments  and  unquoted  financial  assets measured at fair value.\n\nThe  Group  uses  valuation  techniques  that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data are available to measure fair  value,  maximising  the  use  of  relevant observable inputs and minimising the use of unobservable inputs.\n\nAll  assets  and  liabilities  for  which  fair  value is measured  or  disclosed  in  the  financial statements  are  categorised  within  the  fair value hierarchy, described as follows, based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole :",

Where  Government grants relates to non-monetary assets, the cost of assets is presented at gross value and grant significantly complied thereon is recognised as income in the consolidated statement of profit and loss over the useful life of the related assets in proportion in which depreciation is charged.\n\nGrants  related  to  income  are  recognised  in the  consolidated  statement  of  profit  and loss  in  the  same  period  as  the  related  cost which  they  are  intended  to  compensate  are accounted for.\n\n## p Contract Balances\n\n## Contract assets\n\nA contract asset is the right to consideration in exchange for goods or services transferred to the customer. If the Company performs by transferring goods or services to a customer before  the  customer  pays  consideration  or before  payment  is  due,  a  contract  asset  is recognised for the earned consideration that is  conditional.  Contract  assets  are  subject  to impairment assessment.\n\n## Trade receivables\n\nA receivable represents the Group's right to an amount of consideration that is unconditional i.e. only the passage of time is required before payment  of  consideration  is  due  and  the amount is billable. (refer note 3(vii))\n\n## Contract liabilities\n\nA contract liability is the obligation to transfer goods or services to a customer for which the Group  has  received  consideration  from  the customer. Contract liabilities are recognised as revenue when the Group performs obligations under the contract.\n\n## q Revenue recognition\n\nRevenue  from  contracts  with  customers  is recognised  when  control  of  the  goods  or services are transferred to the customer at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Group expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.\n\nRevenue is measured based on the transaction price,  which  is  the  consideration,  adjusted for discounts and other incentives, if any, as specified  in  the  contract  with  the  customer. Revenue also excludes taxes or other amounts collected from customers.\n\nThe disclosure of significant accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions relating to revenue  from  contracts  with customers are provided in Note 3 (vi).\n\nThe specific recognition criteria described below must also be met before revenue is recognised.\n\n## i) Revenue from Power Supply\n\nThe Group's contracts with customers for the  sale  of  electricity  generally  include one  performance  obligation.  The  Group has concluded that revenue from sale of electricity  should  be  recognised  at  the point in time when electricity is transferred to the customer.\n\nRevenue  from  operations  on  account  of Force  Majeure  events  /  change  in  law events  in  terms  of  PPAs  /  SPPAs  with customers (Power Distribution Utilities) is",

Where the tariff rates are yet to be approved, provisional rates are  adopted  considering  the  applicable CERC Tariff Regulations.\n\n## ii) Sale of traded goods\n\nRevenue  from  the  sale  of  traded  goods is  recognised  at  the  point  in  time  when control of the goods is transferred to the customers, which generally coincides with the delivery of goods.\n\n- iii) Carrying  cost  in  respect  of  claims  for change  in  law  of  taxes  and  duties, additional cost incurred on procurement of  alternative  coal  and  on  other  claims are recognised upon approval by relevant regulatory authorities, best management estimates and based on reasonable certainty to expect ultimate collection.\n- iv) Interest  income  is  recognised  on  time proportion basis at the effective interest rate ('EIR') applicable.\n- v) Late payment  surcharge  on  delayed payment  for  power  supply  is  recognised based on receipt / collection from customers or  on  acceptance  /  acknowledgement  by the customers whichever is earlier.\n\n## r Borrowing costs\n\nBorrowing  costs  directly  attributable  to  the acquisition,  construction  or  production  of qualifying  assets,  that  necessarily  take  a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale, are capitalised as part of\n\nthe cost of the asset, until such time as the assets are substantially ready for their intended use  or  sale.  Interest  income  earned  on  the temporary  investment  of  specific  borrowings pending their expenditure on qualifying assets is  deducted from the borrowing costs eligible for capitalisation.\n\nAll  other  borrowing  costs  are  recognised  in the  consolidated  statement  of  profit  and loss  in  the  period  in  which  they  are  incurred. Borrowing  cost  consist  of  interest  and  other costs that an entity incurs in connection with the  borrowing  of  funds.  Borrowing  cost  also includes  exchange  differences  to  the  extent regarded as an adjustment to the borrowing cost.\n\n## s Employee benefits\n\n## i) Defined benefit plans:\n\nThe Group has obligations towards gratuity, a defined benefit retirement plan covering eligible employees (in some cases funded  through  Group  Gratuity  Scheme of  Life  Insurance  Corporation  of  India).

That is, if the contract conveys the right to control  the  use  of  an  identified  asset  for  a period of time in exchange for consideration.\n\n## The Group as lessor\n\nThe determination of whether an arrangement is (or contains) a lease is based on the substance of  the  arrangement  at  the  inception  of  the lease. The arrangement is, or contains, a lease if  fulfilment  of  the  arrangement is dependent on the use of a specific asset or assets and the arrangement conveys a right to use the asset or assets, even if that right is not explicitly specified in an arrangement.\n\nLeases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all  the  risks  and  rewards  of  ownership  to\n\nthe  lessee.  All  other  leases  are  classified  as operating leases.\n\nRental income  from  operating  leases is generally  recognised  on  a  straight-line  basis over the term of the relevant lease. Where the rentals are structured solely to increase in line with expected general inflation to compensate for  the  Group's  expected  inflationary  cost increases, such increases are recognised in the year in which such benefits accrue. Initial direct costs  incurred  in  negotiating  and  arranging an operating lease are added to the carrying amount of the leased asset and recognised on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n\n## The Group as lessee\n\nThe  Group  recognises  right-of-use  assets and  lease  liabilities  for  all  leases  except  for short-term leases and leases of low-value assets.\n\nThe  Group  applies  the  available  practical expedients wherein it:\n\n- y Uses a single discount rate to a portfolio of leases with reasonably similar characteristics\n- y Relies on its assessment of whether leases are onerous immediately before the date of initial application\n- y Applies the short-term leases exemptions to leases with lease term that ends within 12 months at the date of initial application\n- y Excludes the initial direct costs from the measurement of the right-of-use asset at the date of initial application\n- y Uses  hindsight  in  determining  the  lease term where the contract contains options to extend or terminate the lease\n\n## Right-of-use assets\n\nThe Group recognises right-of-use assets at the commencement date of the lease. (i.e., the date the underlying asset is available for use)\n\nThe  cost  of  right-of-use  assets  includes  the amount  of  lease  liabilities  recognised,  initial direct costs incurred, and lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any",

The lease payments include fixed  payments  (including  in  substance  fixed payments) less any lease incentives receivable, variable  lease  payments  that  depend  on  an index  or  a  rate,  and  amounts  expected  to be  paid  under  residual  value  guarantees. The lease payments also include the exercise price of a purchase option reasonably certain to be exercised by the Group and payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the Group exercising the option to terminate. Variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or a rate are recognised as expenses (unless they are incurred to produce inventories) in the period in which the event or condition that triggers the payment occurs.\n\n## Subsequent measurement of lease liability\n\nThe  lease  liability  is  remeasured  when  there is  change  in  future  lease  payments  arising from  a  change  in  an  index  or  a  rate,  or  a change  in  the  estimate  of  the  guaranteed residual value, or a change in the assessment of purchase, extension or termination option. When  the  lease  liability  is  measured,  the corresponding  adjustment  is  reflected  in  the right-of-use assets.\n\n## u Taxes on Income\n\nTax expense comprises current tax and deferred tax. These are recognised in the consolidated statement  of  profit  and  loss  except  to  the extent that it relates to a business combination, or items recognised directly in equity or in other comprehensive income.\n\n## Current tax\n\nTax  on  income  for  the  current  period  is determined on the basis of estimated taxable income and tax credits computed in accordance with the provisions of the relevant tax laws and based on the expected outcome of assessments / appeals.  Current  income  tax  assets  and liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities. Management periodically evaluates positions taken in the tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulations are  subject  to  interpretation  and  establishes provisions where appropriate.\n\nCurrent income tax relating to items recognised outside  profit  or  loss  is  recognised  outside profit  or  loss  (either  in  other  comprehensive income  or  in  equity).  Current  tax  items  are recognised  in  correlation  to  the  underlying transaction either in OCI or directly in equity. Management  periodically  evaluates  positions taken  in  the  tax  returns  with  respect  to situations  in  which  applicable  tax  regulations are  subject  to  interpretation  and  establishes provisions where appropriate.\n\n## Deferred tax\n\nDeferred  tax  is  recognised  for  the  future tax  consequences  of  deductible  temporary differences  between  the  carrying  values  of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases  at  the  reporting  date.  Deferred  tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences except when the deferred tax liability arises at the time of transaction that affects  neither  the  accounting  profit  or  loss nor taxable profit or loss. Deferred tax assets are  generally  recognised  for  all  deductible temporary differences, carry forward of unused tax credits and any unused tax losses, to the extent that it is probable that future taxable income  will  be  available  against  which  the deductible  temporary  differences  and  carry forward  of  unused  tax  credit  and  unused  tax losses can be utilised, except when the deferred tax  asset  relating  to  temporary  differences arising at the time of transaction affects neither the  accounting  profit  or  loss  nor  the  taxable profit or loss.

Unrecognised deferred tax assets are re-assessed at each reporting date and are recognised to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profits will allow the deferred tax assets to be recovered.\n\nDeferred  tax  relating  to  items  recognised outside  the  consolidated  statement  of  profit and loss is recognised outside the consolidated statement  of  profit  and  loss  (either  in  other comprehensive income or directly in equity). Deferred tax items are recognised in correlation to  the  underlying  transaction  either  in  OCI  or directly in equity.\n\nThe  Group  offsets  deferred  tax  assets  and deferred tax liabilities if and only if it has a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets and  current  tax  liabilities  and  the  deferred tax  assets  and  deferred  tax  liabilities  relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority  on  the  same  taxable  entity  which intend either to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis, or to realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously, in each future period in which significant amounts of deferred tax liabilities or assets are expected to be settled or recovered.\n\nWhen  there  is  uncertainty  regarding  income tax treatments, the Group assesses whether a tax authority is likely to accept an uncertain tax treatment. If it concludes that the tax authority is unlikely to accept an uncertain tax treatment, the  effect  of  the  uncertainty  on  taxable income, tax bases and unused tax losses and unused tax credits is recognised. The effect of the uncertainty is recognised using the method that, in each case, best reflects the outcome of the uncertainty: the most likely outcome or the expected value. For each case, the Group evaluates whether to consider each uncertain tax  treatment  separately,  or  in  conjunction with  another  or  several  other  uncertain  tax treatments, based on the approach that best prefixes the resolution of uncertainty.\n\n## v Earnings per share\n\nBasic  earnings  per  share  is  computed  by dividing  the  profit  /  (loss)  after  tax  (net  off distribution  on  Perpetual  Securities  whether declared  or  not)  by  the  weighted  average number  of  equity  shares  outstanding  during the year. Diluted earnings per share is computed  by  dividing  the  profit  /  (loss)  after tax (net off distribution on Perpetual Securities whether  declared  or  not)  as  adjusted  for  the effects of dividend, interest and other charges relating to the dilutive potential equity shares by  weighted  average  number  of  shares  plus dilutive potential equity shares.\n\n## w Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets\n\nThe amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present obligation at the end of the reporting period, taking into account the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation.\n\nA contingent liability is a possible obligation that arises from past events whose existence will be confirmed by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events beyond the  control  of  the  Company  or  a  present obligation that is not recognised because it is not probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation or a reliable estimate of amount cannot be made.\n\nContingent liabilities may arise from litigation, taxation and other claims against the Group. The contingent liabilities are disclosed where it is management's assessment that the outcome of  any  litigation  and  other  claims  against the Group is uncertain or cannot be reliably quantified, unless the likelihood of an adverse outcome is remote.\n\nContingent  assets  are  not  recognised  but are disclosed in the notes where an inflow of economic benefits is probable.\n\nA contingent liability recognised in a business combination  is  initially  measured  at  its  fair value.  Subsequently,  it  is  measured  at  the higher of the amount that would be recognised in accordance  with  the  requirements  for",

The Group estimated the provision based on agreements with  local  /  government  authorities  and  are updated based on actuarial valuation.\n\n## y Impairment of non-financial assets\n\nThe  Group  assess,  at  each  reporting  date whether  there  is  any  indication  that  assets may be impaired. If any such indication exists, the  Group  estimates  the  asset's  recoverable amount. An asset's recoverable amount is the higher  of  an  asset's  or  cash-generating  unit ('CGU')'s  fair  value  less  costs  to  disposal  and its value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their  present  value  using  a  pre-tax  discount rate that reflects current market assessments of  the  time  value  of  money  and  the  risks specific to the asset.\n\nIn assessing value in use, the estimated future cash  flows  are  discounted  to  their  present values  using  a  pre-tax  discount  rate  that reflects  current  market  assessment  of  the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. In determining fair value less cost of disposal, recent market transactions are taken into account. If no such transactions can be identified,  an  appropriate  valuation  model  is used. These calculations are corroborated by valuation  multiples,  quoted  share  prices  for publicly  traded  companies  or  other  available fair value indicators.\n\nThe Group enters into transaction with suppliers that  involves  prepayment  in  conjunction  with advances for goods and services wherein Group assesses at each reporting date whether goods\n\nagainst the advance is recoverable and if there is any indication, the asset may be provided.\n\nGoodwill is tested for impairment annually and when circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired.\n\nThe  Group  bases  its  impairment  calculation on detailed budget and forecast calculations, which  are  prepared  separately  for  each  of the  Group's  cash-generating  unit  to  which the individual assets are allocated. For longer periods, a long term growth rate is calculated and  applied  to  project  future  cash  flows. To  estimate  cash  flow  projections  beyond periods  covered  by  the  most  recent  budget  / forecasts,  the  Company  estimates  cash  flow projections based on estimated growth rate.\n\nIf  the  recoverable  amount  of  an  asset  (or cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised immediately in the consolidated statement of profit and loss.\n\n## z Mine Development Expenditure :\n\n- i) Expenditure  incurred  towards  coal  mines under  construction  are  capitalised  to 'Coal Mines under construction' as long as they meet the capitalisation criteria and is  presented  as  capital  work-in-progress. Upon commencement of production stage, the  'Coal  Mines  under  construction'  is capitalised and presented as 'Mining Rights' under Intangible Assets except in situation when  the  Group  decide  to  surrender  its rights in mine and amount is classified as recoverable from Nominated Authorities.\n- ii) Mining Rights are amortised using unit-ofproduction method on the basis of proven and probable reserves on commencement of commercial production.\n\n## Mine Closure Obligations :\n\nThe liability for meeting the mine closure has been  estimated  based  on  the  mine  closure plan in the proportion of total area exploited to  the  total  area  of  the  mine  as  a  whole. These costs are updated annually during the",

The mine closure obligations are included in Mining Rights under Intangible assets  and  amortised  based  on  unit  of production method.\n\n## 3 Significant accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions\n\nThe preparation of the Group's financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities, and the accompanying  disclosures, and the disclosure of contingent liabilities. The estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant. The  estimates  and  underlying  assumptions  are reviewed  on  an  ongoing  basis  and  any  revisions thereto  are  recognised  in  the  period  of  revision and future periods if the revision affects both the current  and  future  periods.  Uncertainties  about these  assumptions  and  estimates  could  result  in outcomes that require a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets or liabilities affected in future periods.\n\n## Key Sources of estimation uncertainty :\n\nThe  key  assumptions  concerning  the  future  and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the reporting date, that have a significant risk of causing a  material  adjustment  to  the  carrying  amounts of  assets  and  liabilities  within  the  next  financial year,  are  described  below.  Existing  circumstances and assumptions about future developments may change due to market changes or circumstances arising that are beyond the control of the Group. Such  changes  are  reflected  in  the  assumptions when they occur.\n\n## i) Useful lives of property, plant and equipment\n\nIn case of the power plant equipments, where the life of the assets has been estimated at 25 years based on technical assessment, taking into account the estimated usage of the asset and  the  current  operating  condition  of  the asset,  depreciation  on  the  same  is  provided based on the useful life of each component based  on  technical  assessment,  if  materially different from that of the main asset.\n\n## ii) Fair value measurement of financial instruments\n\nIn estimating the fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities, the Group uses market observable  data  to  the  extent  available. Where  such  Level  1  inputs  are  not  available, the  Group  establishes  appropriate  valuation techniques and inputs to the model. The inputs to  these  models  are  taken  from  observable markets where possible, but where this is not feasible,  a  degree of judgement is required in establishing  fair  values.  Judgements  include considerations  of  inputs  such  as  liquidity risk,  credit  risk  and  volatility.  Changes  in assumptions about these factors could affect the reported fair value of financial instruments. Information  about  the  valuation  techniques and  inputs  used  in  determining  the  fair value  of  various  assets  and  liabilities  are disclosed in note 56.\n\n## iii) Defined benefit plans (gratuity benefits)\n\nThe  cost  of  the  defined  benefit  gratuity  plan and the present value of the gratuity obligation are  determined  using  actuarial  valuations. An actuarial valuation involves making various assumptions  that  may  differ  from  actual developments  in  the  future.  These  include the determination of the discount rate, future salary increases and mortality rates. Due to the complexities involved in the valuation and its long-term nature, a defined benefit obligation is highly sensitive to changes  in  these assumptions.  All  assumptions  are  reviewed at  each  reporting  date.  Information  about the various estimates and assumptions made in  determining  the  present  value  of  defined benefit obligations are disclosed in note 58.\n\n## iv) Impairment of non financial assets\n\nFor determining whether property, plant and  equipment  and  goodwill  are  impaired,  it requires an estimation of the value in use of the relevant cash generating units. The value in  use  calculation  is  based  on  a  Discounted Cash  Flow  model  over  the  estimated  useful life  of  the  Power  Plants.  Further,  the  cash flow  projections  are  based  on  estimates  and assumptions  relating  to  tariff,  change  in  law",

Post acquisition of the additional land, the management will update the estimate and assumption of the original completion plan of the assets. Further, given that demand of power is expected to be higher compared with generation capacity available in the industry, the development of asset forming part of Capital Work-In-Progress will have economic viability for the Company.

In terms of the same, the Raipur TPP (the entity stands merged with the Company) has availed exemptions of  duty  of  customs  and  excise  duty  upon  submission  of  bank  guarantees  worth ' 960.01 crore and pledge of margin money deposits of ' 59.67 crore. The grant of final Mega power status of Raipur TPP is dependent upon plant achieving tie up for supply of power for 70% of its installed capacity through long term Power Purchase Agreements by way of competitive bidding and the balance through regulated market within stipulated time. The time period to achieve tie up for supply of power as prescribed in Mega Power Policy has been further extended to 156 months from the date of Import, till September 12, 2024, by the Ministry of Power, Government of India vide amendment dated April 07, 2022. The Management expects to comply the conditions and hence no adjustments are made in the books.\n- (c) In case of Raipur TPP, the Company had entered into a bulk power transmission agreement ('BPTA') with Power Grid Corporation of India Limited ('PGCIL') dated March 31, 2010 as per which the Company was granted Long term Access ('LTA') of 816 MW. However, owing to non-availability  of  PPA,  which  as  per  management  is  beyond  the  control  of  the  Company, Raipur TPP was not in a position to utilise the LTA and has accordingly sought for surrender of the LTA, for which PGCIL has raised demand of ' 154.50 crore towards relinquishment charges on the Company. However, the said claim will be subject to the outcome of the petition dated September 07, 2020 filed by the Company before the APTEL. Presently, the Company has taken legal opinion in the matter as per which there are force majure events and other factors as per which it is not liable to pay charges.\n- 2) For the Company's Udupi TPP and Tiroda TPP, matter on Custom Duty relating to March 2012 to February 2013 is contested at Customs, Excise and Service Tax Appellate Tribunal ('CESTAT').\n- 3) The Central Sale Tax matter of Company's Mundra TPP relating to FY 2017-18, is contested at Commissioner Appeals.",

During the current year, the Company has opted for the amnesty scheme and accordingly the matter stands settled.\n- 5) The Goods and Services Tax matters of Company's Mundra TPP and Raipur TPP relating to FY 2017-18 and Raigarh TPP relating to FY 2022-23, are contested at Commissioner Appeals\n- 6) In  case  of  APJL,  Water  resource  department  ('WRD'),  Jharkhand  has  charged  penalty  on  the amount of penalty on water charges which has not been accepted by APJL as per the terms of agreement and APJL has filed Writ Petition with Hon'ble High court of Jharkhand.\n- 7) In case of MEL, the Company relinquished the long-term transmission agreement for supply of power through Mahan - Sipat transmission line in  April  2017,  which  was  accepted  by  Central Transmission Utility Ltd ('CTUIL'). In this regard, CERC vide its tariff determination order dated March 14, 2022 read with true up order dated November 22, 2023 imposed additional transmission charges on account of change in technical configuration of the transmission line. Subsequently, the Company filed a review petition stating that no additional charges are leviable, as the transmission line was relinquished. Moreover, the Company also filed an appeal in this matter with the APTEL. While the matter is pending final adjudication, APTEL vide its interim order dated January 24, 2023 instructed the Company to make interim payments, till the appeal is finally disposed. As per the APTEL order, the Company had made payment of ' 86.76 crore under protest.\n- ii) In case of the Mundra TPP, apart from above, the Development Commissioner, Mundra has issued a show cause notice to the Company in case of Mundra TPP for the period FY 2009-10 to FY 2014-15 in relation to custom duty on raw materials used for generation of electricity supplied from SEZ to DTA, which amounts to ' 963.94 crore. The Company has contested the said show cause notice. Further, the management is of the view that such duties on raw material are eligible to be made good to Mundra TPP under the PPA with Discoms or are refundable from the Authorities. Hence, the Company has not considered this as contingent liabilities.\n- iii) The Group has assessed that it is only possible, but not probable, that outflow of economic resources will be required in respect of above matters.\n\n## (b)  Commitments :\n\n| Particulars                                                                                                                            | As at   March 31, 2024   | '  In crore As at   March 31, 2023   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------------------|\n| Estimated amount of contracts remaining to be executed on  capital account and not provided for (net of advances) (refer  notes below) | 17,188.08                | 8,674.54                             |\n| Total                                                                                                                                  | 17,188.08                | 8,674.54                             |\n\n## Notes:\n\n- i) In  case  of  the  Company,  capital  commitment  mainly  includes  commitment  relating  to  Flue  Gas Desulfurisation project.\n- ii) Mahan Energen Limited ('MEL') is in the process of undertaking an expansion project of two units of 2*800 MW Ultra super critical thermal power plant ('hereinafter referred as Phase II expansion project') at Bandhoura, District Singrauli, Madhya Pradesh.

The Nominated Authority vide its letter dated September 17, 2021, had accepted the surrender petition by the Company and ordered for invocation of bank guarantee along with obligation to fulfil antecedent liability. On September 29, 2021, the Hon'ble Delhi High Court, in response to petition filed by the Company, has stayed the invocation of the said performance bank guarantee and restrained the Nominated Authority from taking any coercive steps in the matter. The said Writ Petition is yet to be adjudicated by the Delhi High Court. Meanwhile, the Hon'ble Delhi High Court vide its order dated March 03, 2022, had directed the Nominated authority to return the said performance bank guarantee within one week from the date of execution of Letter of Intent of 'Coal Mines Production and Development Agreement' ('CMPDA') with a new bidder and to present the said CMPDA before the Delhi High Court. The Nominated Authority has concluded the fresh e-auction of Jitpur Coal Block on September 13, 2022. Pursuant to this, the CMDPA has been signed between the new bidder and the Nominated Authority, Ministry of Coal on October 13, 2022. The Nominated Authority is yet to submit CMPDA with new bidder with Delhi High Court in the matter.\n\nEarlier, the Company has submitted the details of costs / expenditure incurred towards development of mine with Nominated Authority, and based on allotment of mine to a new bidder, the Company expects a favourable resolution relating to cost realisation of Jitpur mine with Nominated Authority and for release of Performance Bank  Guarantee.  The  Company  has  also  obtained  legal  opinion  basis  which  it  is  reasonably  confident  to get  compensation  realised  of  the  entire  costs  incurred  towards  the  development  of  the  coal  mine  in  the subsequent period.\n\n- 48 The Company through erstwhile subsidiary, Raipur Energen Limited ('REL') has incurred cost of ' 55.57 crore and ' 30.75  crore  towards  development  of  Talabira  Coal  mine  and  Ganeshpura  Coal  mine,  respectively  in the earlier years.\n- In the above matter, earlier the Company had filed two writ petitions with Hon'ble Delhi High Court requesting surrender of the said mines in view of Union of India's ('UoI') notification dated April 16, 2015 stating capping of the fixed / capacity charges and also requested to refund the costs incurred along with the release of bid security. The Hon'ble Delhi High Court vide its single order dated April 15, 2019 dismissed the petitions on the ground of delay in filling of writ petitions. Consequently, the Company filed petitions before Hon'ble Supreme Court to set aside the order of the Hon'ble Delhi High Court. Pending adjudication of the petitions, Hon'ble Supreme Court directed UoI and others vide its order dated May 30, 2019 that no coercive action to be taken in these matters.\n\nThe management expects favourable resolution of these matters and is reasonably confident to realise the entire cost spent towards these coal mines as compensation in the subsequent periods.\n\nHowever, the matter has been pending for long period of time, the company based on prudence principles has fully provided the amount in the books for the purpose of financial reporting.\n\n- 49 The Government of India conducted bidding for allocation of coal blocks, under the coal block auction process whereby the MEL acquired the rights of Tokisud Coal Block (in the state of Jharkhand) on March 18, 2015. Subsequently, in the month of April 2015, by way of a notification, Ministry of Power put cap on the fixed/ capacity charges due to which MEL had filed a writ petition in the High Court of Delhi for impugning the above referred notification and also offered to return the said coal block to the Government of India against return of the performance security in the form of Bank Guarantee of ' 261.76 crore provided by MEL and moneys paid, without any penalty.\n\nHowever, Hon'ble High Court vide its judgement dated April 15, 2019 dismissed the petition of MEL. Subsequently, MEL has filed Special Leave Petition (SLP) before the Hon'ble Supreme Court against the order of the Hon'ble High Court. Meanwhile, the bank guarantee of ' 261.76 crore was invoked by the Nominated Authority.",

MEL had incurred a total cost of ' 491.62 crore towards development of tokisud coal mine. Nominated authority vide order dated March 16, 2022 determined ' 163.23 crore being the total compensation payable by successful allottee (NMDC) to the MEL. The said amount has been received during the year ended March 31, 2023. During the pendency of the matter in Supreme Court, the Company has fully provided for the balance receivable of ' 328.41 crore in the books for the purpose of financial reporting.\n\n- 50 i) The National Green Tribunal ('NGT') in a matter relating to non-compliance of environmental norms relating to Udupi thermal power plant ('Udupi TPP') directed the Company vide its order dated March 14, 2019, to make payment of ' 5.00 crore as an interim environmental compensation to Central Pollution Control Board ('CPCB'), which was deposited by the Company with CPCB under protest, in April 2019 and expensed the same in the books.\n- NGT vide its order dated May 31, 2022 settled the matter and directed the Company to deposit an additional amount of ' 47.02 crore with CPCB within 3 months from the date of order. The Company has recognised expense provision of ' 47.02 crore in the books on a conservative basis, although, the Company has filed petition  with  the  Hon'ble  Supreme Court dated August 26, 2022 against the above referred NGT order. The Udupi TPP continues to operate in compliance with all the conditions under Environment Clearance as at reporting date.\n- ii) In  case of MEL, Hon'ble National Green Tribunal (NGT) vide order dated August 28, 2018 has prohibited Northern Coalfields  Limited  (NCL)  to  transport  coal  by  road,  who  is  the  major  supplier  of  coal  to  MEL. The customers of NCL (along with the Company) had requested for some time to allow till a alternative arrangement for transportation of coal is in place. The Oversight Committee of NGT (Committee) as an interim measure allowed to transportation of coal by road for two months period.\n\nIn the meantime, NCL moved application before Hon'ble NGT to review its order. However their application was rejected. Thereafter NCL moved to Hon'ble Supreme Court who stated that 'status quo as of today shall be maintained in the meantime'.\n\nHowever  the  Committee  is  of  the  view  that  Status  quo  order  was  passed  when  NGT  order  on  coal transportation was in operation which has prohibited NCL to transport coal by road. Consequently, a General Notice from NCL on June 22, 2019 has been served on MEL confirming the above position to stop sale of coal by road to MEL at its Power Plant at Singrauli M.P, Sonabhadra U.P.\n\nSubsequently, NCL decided to keep the sale of coal in abeyance for the time being and to approach Hon'ble Supreme Court for further resolution of issue. The Company has also approached Hon'ble Supreme Court to obtain necessary directions which would ensure continuous operations of the Company, since its operations came to halt fully (for 7 days) after supply of coal being stopped by NCL.\n\nHon'ble Supreme Court vide its order dated July 01, 2019 has ordered to maintain status quo i.e. permitting the transportation of coal by road from NCL till the further order. Pending the decision of Hon'ble Supreme Court, the Company is presently getting the supply of coal through road for its operations of generation of electricity.\n\n- 51 (a) In respect of Mundra TPP, the management believes that on account of resolution of majority of the issues relating to tariff compensation claim with GUVNL and Haryana Discoms and also on account of execution of 360 MW PPA with MPSEZ Utilities Limited ('MUL'), and certain other factors, Mundra TPP of the Company would be able to establish profitable operations over a foreseeable future and meet its performance and financial obligations. During the year, the Company has resumed supply of power to Haryana Discom and consequently has improved its operational performance in terms of achieving Higher Plant load factor (PLF) and generating positive operating cashflows, hence, based on the assessment of value in use of Mundra TPP, no provision / adjustment is considered necessary to the carrying value of its Mundra TPP related property, plant and equipment aggregating to ' 15,094.30 crore as at March 31, 2024.",

Further, the cash flow projections are based on estimates and assumptions relating to tariff, operational performance of the Plants, availability of domestic coal under fuel supply agreement / coal linkage as per the directives of Competent Authority, life extension plans, market prices of coal and other fuels, exchange variations, inflation, terminal value etc. which are considered reasonable by the Management.\n- On a careful evaluation of the aforesaid factors, the Management of the Group has concluded that the recoverable value of such CGUs individually is higher than their respective carrying amounts as at March 31, 2024. However, if these estimates and assumptions were to change in future, there could be corresponding impact on the recoverable amounts of the Plants.\n- 52 The Group has taken various derivatives to hedge its risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations on items including principal loan amount, Trade Credits, Letter of Credits etc. and interest thereof along with interest rate changes.

The Management ensures appropriate risk governance framework for the Group through appropriate policies and procedures and the risks are identified, measured and managed in accordance with the Group's policies and risk objectives.\n\nThe Group's financial liabilities (other than derivatives) comprises mainly of borrowings including interest accrual, leases, trade, capital and other payables. The Group's financial assets (other than derivatives) comprise mainly of investments, cash and cash equivalents, other balances with banks, loans, trade and other receivables.\n\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Group is exposed to Market risk, Credit risk and Liquidity risk.\n\n## (i) Market risk\n\nMarket risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market prices. Market risk comprises three types of risk: interest rate risk, currency risk and commodity risk.\n\n## a) Interest rate risk\n\nInterest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates. The Group's exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates relates primarily to the part of Group's debt obligations with floating interest rates.\n\nThe Group manages its interest rate risk by having a mixed portfolio of fixed and variable rate loans and  borrowings.  Significant  portion  of  Group's  borrowings  is  in ' and  are  borrowed  at  fluctuating interest rates.\n\nThe sensitivity analysis have been carried out based on the exposure to interest rates for instruments not hedged against interest rate fluctuation at the end of the reporting period. The said analysis has been carried out on the amount of floating rate liabilities outstanding at the end of the reporting period. The year end balances are not necessarily representative of the average debt outstanding during the year. A 50 basis point increase or decrease represents management's assessment of the reasonably possible change in interest rates.\n\nIn  case  of  fluctuation  in  interest  rates  by  50  basis  points  on  the  exposure  of  borrowings  (having fluctuating rates i.e. exposed to changes in rates) of ' 28,053.90 crore as on March 31, 2024 and ' 21,985.47 crore as on March 31, 2023 respectively and if all other variables were held constant, the Group's profit or loss for the year would increase or decrease as follows :\n\n| Particulars                                      |   For the year ended  March 31, 2024 |   '  In crore For the year ended  March 31, 2023 |\n|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|\n| Impact on Profit or Loss before tax for the year |                               140.27 |                                           109.93 |\n| Impact on Equity                                 |                               104.97 |                                           109.93 |\n\nThe Group intends to hold investment in liquid mutual fund for relatively shorter period and hence, interest rate risk is not material to that extent.\n\n## b) Foreign currency risk\n\nForeign currency risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of an exposure will fluctuate because of changes in foreign exchange rates. The Group's exposure to the risk of changes in foreign exchange rates relates primarily to the Group's operating activities (Coal imports etc.) and borrowings. The Group manages its foreign currency risk by hedging transactions that are expected to realise in future.",

The Group also enters into various foreign exchange hedging contracts such as forward covers, swaps, options etc. to mitigate the risk arising out of foreign exchange rate movement on foreign currency borrowings or trade payables. (including Capital Creditors)\n\nEvery one percentage point depreciation / appreciation in the exchange rate between the Indian rupee and U.S.dollar on the unhedged exposure of $ 73.52 million as on March 31, 2024 and $ 234.08 million as on March 31, 2023 would have affected the Group's profit or loss for the year as follows:\n\n| Particulars                                                                                                         |   For the year ended  March 31, 2024 |   '  In crore For the year ended  March 31, 2023 |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|\n| Impact on Profit or Loss before tax for the year (Net  of amounts capitalised under Property, Plant and  Equipment) |                                 6.13 |                                            19.23 |\n| Impact on Equity                                                                                                    |                                 4.59 |                                            16.38 |\n\n## c) Commodity price risk\n\nThe Group's exposure to commodity price is affected by a number of factors including the effect of regulation, the price volatility of coal prices in the market, including imported coal, contract size and length, market condition etc. which is moderated by optimising the procurement under fuel supply agreement and getting compensated under long term power purchase agreements and change in law regulation. In case, the Group anticipates non-availability of coal, the same is mitigated by sourcing imported coal in advance to meet the demand. Its operating / trading activities require the on-going purchase for continuous supply of coal and other commodities. Therefore the Group monitors its purchases closely to optimise the procurement cost.\n\n## (ii)  Credit risk\n\nCredit risk is the risk that counter party will not meet its obligations under a financial instrument or customer contract, leading to a financial loss.\n\n## a) Trade Receivables\n\nThe  Group  is  having  majority  of  receivables  from  State  Electricity  Boards  which  are  Government undertakings and have interest clause on delayed payments and hence, they are secured from credit losses in the future. The receivable against supply of Electricity to Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB) are secured against sovereign guarantee of Bangladesh Government.\n\n## b) Other Financial Assets\n\nThis comprises of deposit with banks, loans, investments in mutual funds, derivative assets and other receivables. The company limits its exposure to credit risks arising from these financial assets and there is no collateral held against these because counter parties are group companies, banks and recognised financial institutions. Banks and recognised financial institutions have high credit ratings assigned by credit rating agencies.\n\n## (iii)  Liquidity risk\n\nLiquidity risk is the risk that the Company will encounter difficulty in meeting the obligations associated with is financial liabilities.",

The  Group's  objective  is  to  provide  financial  resources  to  meet  its  business  objectives  in  a  timely, cost effective and reliable manner and to manage its capital structure.

However,  the  SC  concluded  that  the  SEBI  should  complete  the  pending  two  investigations, preferably  within  3  months,  and  take  its  investigations  (including  the  twenty-two  investigations  already completed) to their logical conclusion in accordance with law.\n\nDuring the year ended March 31, 2024, the Company has received two show cause notices ('SCN') from the SEBI alleging non-compliance of provisions pertaining to related party transactions in the Listing Agreement and LODR Regulations with regard to certain transactions by the Company with third parties in earlier financial years,  from  a  substance-over-form  perspective,  which  were  fully  settled  during  the  year  ended  March  31, 2023. As a consequence, the SCNs allege that the said transactions are not reported in the relevant years' financial  statements  /  annual  report,  and  requisite  review  /  approvals  for  such  transactions  is  not  taken,  as applicable. Subsequent to year end, the Company has responded to SEBI on both SCNs. Based on legal advice obtained, management believes that considering that alleged transactions with third parties were undertaken in compliance with applicable law at the relevant time, at terms comparable to market rates, and accordingly, there is no non-compliance of applicable laws and regulations as alleged by the SCNs, and the SCNs have no material consequential effects to the relevant years' financial statements.\n\nIn April 2023, the Holding Company had obtained a legal opinion by independent law firm, confirming (a) none of the alleged related parties mentioned in the short-seller report were related parties to the Group, under applicable frameworks;  and  (b)  the  Group  is  in  compliance  with  the  requirements  of  applicable  laws  and  regulations. Subsequent to the SC order dated January 03, 2024, to uphold the principles of good governance, the Adani Group has also initiated an independent legal and accounting review of the allegations in the SSR and other allegations  (including  any  allegations  related  to  the  Holding  Company)  to  reassert  compliance  of  applicable laws and regulations. Such independent review also did not identify any non-compliances or irregularities by the Group, and management has noted on record, the results of this review.\n\nBased on the legal opinions obtained, subsequent independent review referred to above, the SC order and the fact that there are no pending regulatory or adjudicatory proceedings as of date, except relating to the SCNs as mentioned above, management of the Holding Company concludes that there are no material consequences of the allegations mentioned in the SSR and other allegations on the Company, and accordingly, no adjustments have been made in these financial statements in this regard.\n\n## 69 Related party transactions\n\n## a.

Demat  account  holders would be able to cast their vote without having to register again with the ESPs, thereby, not only facilitating seamless authentication but also enhancing ease and convenience of participating in e-voting process.\n\nStep 1: Access through Depositories CDSL/ NSDL e-Voting system in case of individual shareholders holding shares in demat mode.\n\n- (iv)  In terms of SEBI circular no.

        "page_content": "## Note 10: Acquisition by way of Amalgamation\n\nMEL,  as  part  of  its  discussions,  has  been  given  to understand  that  AEL  is  desirous  of  divesting  its investment in SMRPL holding mining rights in Dhirauli coal block ('Dhirauli').\n\nAs Dhirauli coal block is located in close proximity to MEL's power plant in Singrauli, MEL is ideally positioned to acquire Dhirauli coal block and use extracted coal for generation of power at its thermal power plant at Mahan. This will allow MEL to improve the availability of coal and provide it with an alternative source of supply to supplement its existing coal sourcing contracts resulting in optimization of overall coal cost and lead time. In view of the above, MEL proposes to amalgamate SMRPL from AEL for which MEL will pay consideration to AEL.\n\nThe  Dhirauli  coal  mining  block  has  a  capacity  to produce 6.5 MTPA of coal. This mine has been awarded to  SMRPL  on  January  11,  2021  under  a  commercial coal  mining  license.  Pursuant  to  an  application  for proposed amalgamation of SMRPL with MEL, Ministry of Coal (MoC) has issued a letter dt. May 08, 2024 to SMRPL consenting amalgamation of SMRPL with MEL. Post  proposed  amalgamation,  a  Mining  Lease  Deed by  MEL  with  the  Nominated  Authority  is  expected to be executed.\n\nThe  Board  recommends  passing  of  the  Ordinary Resolutions as set out in Item nos. 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, and 16 of this Notice, for approval by the Members of the Company.\n\nAs per the SEBI Listing Regulations, all related parties of the Company, whether or not a party to the proposed transaction(s), shall abstain from voting on the said resolutions.\n\nMr. Gautam S.

This remuneration will be distributed amongst all or some of the Non-Executive Directors in accordance with the directions given by the Board of Directors and subject to any other applicable requirements under the Act.\n\nAccordingly,  the  Board  recommends  the  resolution set  forth  in  Item  No.  17  relating  to  payment  of remuneration to Non-Executive Directors, by way of an Ordinary Resolution.\n\nAll  Non-Executive  Directors  of  the  Company  may  be deemed to be concerned or interested in this resolution to the extent of commission / remuneration that may be payable to them from time to time and none of the other Directors or key managerial personnel or their relatives is, in anyway, concerned or interested in the resolution set out at Item No. 17 above.\n\n## For Item No. 18\n\nThe  Board,  on  the  recommendation  of  the  Audit Committee, has approved the appointment and remuneration  of  M/s.
