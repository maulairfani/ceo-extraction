We are rewarding shareholders, strengthening our technology resiliency to do better by customers, and increasing our support for vulnerable segments.\n\nThe global economy averted a hard landing in 2023. After hiking interest rates seven times in 2022, the Federal Reserve - in a bid to combat the highest inflation in generations - raised short-term borrowing costs by another four times to 5.25-5.5%, the highest level in 22 years. Central banks around the world followed suit.\n\nElevated interest rates dampened consumer and investment demand, and stymied global trade. US-China tensions, the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war, as well as the IsraelHamas conflict, added to the uncertainty.\n\nDBS' key markets Singapore and Hong Kong - being small, open economies - were impacted by slowing external demand. Singapore's economy grew 1.1% in 2023, down from 3.8% the year before. Hong Kong's economy did better - with advance estimates indicating that it expanded by 3.2% - though this was weaker than expected.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, we delivered a solid financial performance, with net profit and return on equity at record highs. In a year marked by tumult in the US regional banking sector and the failure of Credit Suisse, we were named as Safest Bank in Asia by Global Finance for the 15 th consecutive year. This is testament to DBS' resilient franchise, underpinned by a solid balance sheet and prudent risk management, which position\n\nus well to be an important partner to our customers and the community.\n\n## A record year\n\nFor the year, DBS delivered record total income of SGD 20.2 billion, crossing the SGD 20 billion mark for the first time. Net profit rose 26% to an all-time high of SGD 10.3 billion. Return on equity (ROE), at 18.0%, broke all previous records.\n\nEarnings were propelled by tailwinds from a rising interest rate environment, with net interest margin expanding 40 basis points to 2.15%. Non-interest income also recovered strongly, bolstered by wealth management fees, card fees and loanrelated fees. Our solid financial performance was not just a reflection of the macroeconomic environment, but also a result of the structural shifts made to our franchise in the last decade. In particular, our focus on digitalisation, cash management and wealth management broadened our lowcost deposit base, from which we benefitted in 2023. Meanwhile, we transformed DBS Private Bank to become one of the top three in Asia, compared to in 2010, when it was outside the top 20. Treasury Markets shifted from being a business which relied mostly on proprietary trading to being primarily a customer-focused business. Across the\n\nThe challenges facing our world - from military con \u0235 icts to rapid technological change to the present climate crisis - are multifaceted and complex. To future-proof ourselves, we need to strengthen our existing competencies and invest in new capabilities, while being nimble enough to respond to any unexpected changes in the external environment. As we have done in the past, we will continue to build on our DNA as an innovation-led, purpose-driven bank to build a sustainable advantage.\n\nfranchise, asset quality remained resilient, which reflects improvements made to our credit processes and the use of data analytics and artificial intelligence.\n\nConsumer Banking/ Wealth Management had a solid year, with total income up 35% to a record SGD 8.96 billion. In Singapore, we remained the market leader in deposits and mortgages. Compared to the previous year, an improving investment climate also encouraged more customers to convert their deposits into investments. Wealth management assets under management increased by 23% to SGD 365 billion.\n\nInstitutional Banking, which saw income rise 22% to a record SGD 9.36 billion, was buoyed by a sharp rise in cash management income. Our early investment in digital transaction capabilities continued to pay off, as we won over 1,000 cash management mandates in 2023. Income from Treasury Markets fell by 38% to SGD 725 million due to higher funding costs.\n\nWhile we continue to watch macroeconomic and geopolitical events closely, our solid balance sheet with ample liquidity, prudent general allowance reserves and healthy capital ratios will provide us with strong buffers against uncertainties.\n\n## SGD 20.2 billion\n\n## Total income\n\nTotal income grew 22%, exceeding SGD 20 billion for the \u0234 rst time.\n\n## Cementing our Asia franchise\n\nEven with a slowing China, Asia's structural growth story is very much intact. Asia's large, growing middle class; burgeoning wealth; massive infrastructure needs; as well as rising intra-Asia trade underpin its prospects. Through the inorganic transactions we did in the Covid-19 years, we have now reached inflection point in India and Taiwan in terms of scale.\n\nIn India, following the integration of Lakshmi Vilas Bank, we now have more than 520 branches in 350+ locations, and a complete suite of products for every market segment. Outside Singapore, we have the most complete platform in India. With a deep footprint in five southern Indian states, growing brand recognition, and a continued rollout of new products and partnerships, we are seeing payoff to the business. In 2023, the consumer banking business saw double-digit income growth by scaling and deepening partnerships with ecosystem players such as Bajaj Finance and Cred. We also leveraged our expanded customer franchise and footprint to increase market penetration of personal loans, gold loans, small business loans and insurance. Overall, our customer base grew 18%, while income and net profit rose 15% and 30% respectively.\n\n## SGD 10.3 billion\n\n## Net pro \u0234 t\n\nNet pro \u0234 t rose 26% to a record SGD 10.3 billion, as we bene \u0234 tted from higher interest rates and reaped the rewards of structural shifts made to our franchise in the last decade.\n\nIn August, DBS completed the acquisition of Citigroup Inc.'s consumer banking business in Taiwan. With the transaction, DBS has become Taiwan's largest foreign bank by assets. DBS Taiwan's consumer business growth has been accelerated by at least 10 years, and annual revenue was propelled past the SGD 1.3 billion mark. Our consumer banking customers in Taiwan more than doubled to about 1.1 million. We also have clear market leadership in loans, deposits, cards and investments among foreign players in the market.\n\nWe continued to make important strides in China. Since its borders reopened in 2023, we have seen an uptick in China connectivity with Singapore and other ASEAN countries. To capture business opportunities from China, we launched a foreign direct investment desk in Singapore. Our 'China plus one' strategy, supporting companies wanting to diversify their supply chains and operations, had good traction. We also continued to make headway in growing our Greater Bay Area (GBA) franchise, both in wealth management as well as in banking corporates in the electric vehicle, high-tech manufacturing and new economy industries. In early 2024, we upped our stake in Shenzhen Rural Commercial Bank (SRCB) from 13% to 16.69%. SRCB is a high-returns bank, in which we are the largest shareholder, and gives us a good footprint in the GBA.\n\n## SGD 1.92\n\n## Dividend\n\nThe Board proposed a \u0234 nal dividend of 54 cents per share, bringing the full-year ordinary dividend to SGD 1.92 per share, an increase of 42 cents from the previous year.\n\n## 1-for-10\n\n## Bonus issue\n\nThe Board also proposed a bonus issue on the basis of one bonus share for every existing 10 ordinary shares held, which will increase the pace of capital returns to shareholders.",

The International Monetary Fund's latest projections are for the global economy to grow at 3.1% in 2024 and 3.2% in 2025. While this is an improvement from the previous forecast, it is below the historical (2000 - 2019) average of 3.8%. We also need to keep a close eye on geopolitics, particularly the impact of the Israel-Hamas conflict on oil prices.\n\nAlthough we remain watchful, we take heart that our franchise continues to be resilient. Barring any unexpected shocks to the global economy, DBS' ROE in 2024 will be in the guided range of 15-17%.\n\nAs we look ahead, we will continue to invest in cementing our digital banking leadership, particularly strengthening our technology resiliency and investing in AI/ ML so we\n\ncan deliver banking that is seamless and personalised. We will also continue to step up efforts in advancing the sustainability agenda and executing on our net-zero commitments.\n\nThe challenges facing our world - from military conflicts to rapid technological change to the present climate crisis - are multifaceted and complex. To future-proof ourselves, we need to strengthen our existing competencies and invest in new capabilities, while being nimble enough to respond to any unexpected changes in the external environment. As we have done in the past, we will continue to build on our DNA as an innovation-led, purpose-driven bank to build a sustainable advantage.\n\nPeter Seah Chairman DBS Group Holdings\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPiyush Gupta Chief Executive Officer DBS Group Holdings\n\n<!-- image -->",

Notwithstanding slowing China growth, Asia remains the fastest-growing region in the world. This has been fuelled by structural trends: a rising middle class, burgeoning affluent population, greater cross-border flows and massive demand for infrastructure investment. We have strategically shaped our business to capture these trends. For example, our wealth management franchise rides the wave of rising affluence while our treasury and transaction banking solutions have been scaled to capture growing trade and investment flows.\n\nAdditionally, having a footprint in Asia's three key axes of growth - Southeast Asia, South Asia and Greater China - through our focus on six key markets has been advantageous. We are able to intermediate intra-Asia trade and capital flows. Being anchored in Singapore and Hong Kong\n\npositions us to serve the regional headquarters of western and Asian multinationals while our local franchises in China, Indonesia, India and Taiwan enable us to go deep by serving local businesses and consumers.\n\nThe diversification also enables us to navigate divergences in economic cycles. For many years, Greater China was a significant propellant of our growth as we rode on China enterprises' outbound expansion and Hong Kong's role in the mainland's development. Today, we are fortuitously placed to capture India's accelerating growth momentum.\n\nThe second factor is the digital transformation we embarked on a decade ago. Because of the long gestation period before the fruits become tangible - to our customers in terms of convenience and ease, to our staff in terms of how they work, and to our shareholders in terms of the concomitant financial impact our head start has continued to set us apart as a bank, employer and investment.\n\nOur digital platforms have made it easier for customers to carry out the full range of everyday transactions. As a result, customer engagement has deepened, translating into stickier relationships and greater wallet share, and ultimately faster revenue growth.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDigitalisation has enabled us to become market leaders in high-returns businesses such as wealth management. Meanwhile, our APIs (or pipes linking our systems with clients') have driven market share gains in cash management. We can also structure treasury products at speed and scale and with attractive pricing.\n\nTechnology has also improved the way our employees work and is central to our efforts to create a culture different from a traditional institution's. It has enabled data to be quickly sorted, packaged and shared among teams, making it instrumental in breaking down silos. Decisions can be made and implementation carried out expeditiously, giving us the agility akin to a startup's. Not constrained by organisational limitations, we are able to adopt the customer's perspective when creating products and services, resulting in a differentiated customer experience.\n\nThe institutionalisation of digitalisation into our franchise has also meant we can readily experiment with and assimilate new technologies that will ineluctably arise. We have infused artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ ML) into more than 350 use cases across the bank to drive productivity. We have expanded our business through ecosystem partnerships by using AI/ ML and data to identify the subset of existing customers in those platforms that we can suitably and profitably offer our products to. Ecosystem partnerships have helped double our Consumer Banking/ Wealth Management customer base over the past six years to 18 million today.\n\nThese dual characteristics of our franchise - unique geographical footprint and innate digital capabilities - are strategic advantages that are difficult to replicate. They are also the drivers of our performance. Their value has only become more apparent as interest rates rose. The record ROE we achieved in 2023 is one of the highest among developed market banks and six percentage points above the last time when interest rates and credit costs were at similar levels. We believe that the franchise we have developed will enable us to continue outperforming peers into the future.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nQ2 2023 was the year of Gen AI and the use of AI will proliferate even more greatly in the years to come. It is also a big focus area for DBS. What excites you most about the space, and what about it keeps you up at night?\n\nAI and Gen AI are game changers, and we will see significant developments in the next five years that will fundamentally shape the way we work. The use of AI is not new to DBS, and we have been working with AI for over a decade now.\n\nIn the past five years, we have scaled our AI capabilities to make it pervasive across all parts of the bank, delivering tangible outcomes of SGD 370 million for DBS in 2023, more than double that of the previous year. We are confident of growing the economic impact of our AI initiatives in the coming years, affording us greater flexibility to navigate through business and economic cycles.\n\nWhat's different with the emergence of Gen AI is that we now have the ability to process vast amounts of unstructured data. Coupled with our existing capabilities around structured data, we are well placed to sharpen the outcomes of our current AI use cases while enabling a new class of data-driven use cases.\n\nIn our early experiments with Gen AI, we came up with over 240 ideas, 15 of which are progressing from experimentation to production. These are broadly focused on three areas of opportunity:\n\n- \u00b7 Driving productivity and efficiency gains by removing toil in the way we work\n- \u00b7 Creating value through better customer engagement and new customer propositions\n- \u00b7 Creating positive impact to our business model by potentially opening new segments and markets.\n\nOur immediate focus has been on the first category. Gen AI is already augmenting the way we work by handling routine tasks, allowing employees to focus on more strategic and value-added activities, such as building deeper customer relationships.\n\nThe results are promising. In our corporate call centre, we are using Gen AI for call transcription, summarisation, service request generation and knowledge base lookup, reducing the amount of time needed to handle customer requests while improving our response quality.\n\nIn Institutional Banking, we tapped Gen AI to help reduce the time needed for relationship managers to fill in the ESG risk questionnaire by summarising company reports and prepopulating relevant fields.\n\nGen AI assisted software development is showing positive results. Through Gen AI code and tests generation, we expect significant time saving in software development.\n\nThe launch of \"DBS-GPT\", our employee-facing version of ChatGPT, is helping employees with content generation and writing tasks in a secure environment. We are also developing an enterprise knowledge base that will give our employees the ability to search and synthesise unstructured information for various tasks.\n\nAs with any new technology, the advent of Gen AI brings about a natural sense of curiosity and adjustment for our employees. But change also presents exciting opportunities\n\nfor growth and innovation. We are determined to bring our employees along by focusing on the synergy between human and AI capabilities to leverage Gen AI as a co-pilot.\n\nWhile Gen AI has tremendous potential, there are emergent risks, especially in areas such as data confidentiality, Gen AI hallucination/ bias/ toxicity and cybersecurity. At DBS, we will continue to enhance our existing AI/ ML risk framework to cater for such risks.\n\nWe have also set up a Responsible AI taskforce comprising senior leaders from multiple disciplines to assess and address these risks prior to any use case being deployed in production. Our existing responsible data use framework for AI continues to provide us with guardrails as we look at new use cases. This framework, called PURE, ensures that our use of data remains Purposeful, Unsurprising, Respectful and Explainable for customers. In addition, we are building a technology infrastructure to enable the adoption of Large Language Models in a secure manner.\n\nConcurrently we worked with the Monetary Authority of Singapore as part of the MindForge Consortium to develop a whitepaper that examines the risks and opportunities of Gen AI for the financial sector.\n\nWe are at a historic cusp in time, and we will all need to navigate how Gen AI figures in the way we live and work. On DBS' end, we have in place a governance structure that will help us balance reaping the benefits of Gen AI while managing the risks of a still-emerging field.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Q3 DBS often says that being purpose-driven is part of its DNA. How does this translate into the way the bank operates its business or interacts with society?\n\nDBS was formed as the Development Bank of Singapore in 1968 to help finance the nation's industrialisation, so a deep sense of purpose is strongly ingrained in our ethos. This shows up in a very clear approach - we are not just here to make profits in any way possible; we are here because we have a meaningful role to play in the economy and society, and our actions must always reflect this reality.\n\nBanking and finance have had a very significant role to play over the ages b helping individuals save for the future, buy a home or grow their wealth. Banks also help companies grow by financing trade and enabling working capital efficiencies. Even though bankers have gone off course from time to time, the most sustainable banking models have been built on doing real things for real people. In recognition of this, our purpose at DBS is to drive amazing solutions and experiences for our customers, to make banking joyful and create a more sustainable bank.\n\nIn formulating our business strategies, we always start with the question \"What value are we creating? For whom?\". In most cases, we can earn a fair return while creating such value. In some instances, we compromise on short-term returns for the greater good. Our dealings with migrant labour in Singapore are a case in point. From pure economics, one could easily make the case that we should pass on this unprofitable segment. However, recognising our role as the people's bank, we chose to grapple with the problem, and figure ways to drive down the cost to serve and make the business viable. b\n\nWhile our strategies will continue to evolve, going forward, as part of our business, we will see what we can do to address four wicked problems besetting our world. b These are: (i) climate change (ii) demographic shifts, particularly ageing societies (iii) rising income inequality and the growing social divide, and (iv) issues of trust. These issues are mammoth; however, the private sector - with its resources and talent pool - has an active role to play in tackling them in concert with governments and civil society. bb\n\nA second agenda that is informed by being purpose-driven is the need to uphold the trust our customers place in us. b Various customer surveys indicate that being financially strong, as well as providing banking that is secure and reliable, are key to being trusted. b DBS' robust franchise, underpinned by a solid balance sheet and prudent risk management, has enabled us to be among the safest banks globally. We also take seriously the need to protect customers from fast-evolving scam and fraud tactics. As an example, in 2023, we rolled out new security measures to thwart malware threats and enable customers to lock up their accounts.\n\nThird, by creating impact beyond banking. b DBS established the SGD 50 million DBS Foundation in support of social entrepreneurship in 2014; in 2022, the bank announced that it had set aside an additional SGD 100 million to create a new Community Impact Chapter and support other philanthropic efforts. In 2023, the bank further committed up to SGD 1 billion over the next 10 years to improve the lives and livelihoods of the low-income and underprivileged.\n\nFundamentally, DBS' ethos drives us to do what is right by our clients, employees, shareholders and society. We are committed to continuing to do well by doing good as we build a sustainable franchise.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPiyush Gupta Chief Executive Officer DBS Group Holdings",

The results re \u0235 ect the fruits of our digital transformation.\n\n## Digitally-transformed franchise with structurally higher ROE\n\nWe achieved a record performance for a third consecutive year in 2023 as net profit rose 26% to SGD 10.3 billion. Total income grew 22% to cross SGD 20 billion for the first time from a higher net interest margin, a rebound in fee income and record treasury customer sales. The underlying cost-income ratio improved to 39%. Asset quality continued to be resilient with specific allowances remaining low at 11 basis points of loans.\n\nNotably, return on equity (ROE) reached a new high of 18%, significantly above previous years and placing us among the world's best performing banks. The ROE was six percentage points above 2006 when Fed rates were last above 5% and credit conditions similarly benign, reflecting structural improvements from the franchise and digital transformations we carried out over the past decade. At the same time, our ROE advantage over peers also widened.\n\nAt our Digital Investor Day in May 2023, we highlighted three ways that our digital transformation had boosted ROE.\n\nFirst, it strengthened our current and savings account (Casa) franchise by improving our standing as the primary bank for retail and corporate customers. During the quantitative easing of 2020-21, our Casa deposits increased by 60% or SGD 143 billion to SGD 381 billion, faster than the industry. More than half of this increase was in foreign currencies, enabling us to grow foreign currency loans with greater profitability.\n\nDespite industry-wide Casa outflows since mid-2022 due to rising interest rates, total Casa deposits at end-2023 were SGD 48 billion higher than at end-2019. Our SGD and foreign currency Casa ratios stood at 86% and 35% in 2023 compared to 69% and 21% in 2006.\n\nSecond, technology and data enabled us to gain wallet share in fee income from better customer targeting and engagement. Since 2014, our fee income has grown at a compounded annual growth rate of 6%. This was significantly faster than peers, which continued to be the case in 2023. We achieved a stronger recovery in wealth management fees following an industry-wide decline in 2022 when interest rates rose and geopolitical tensions flared. Net new money inflows, which had more than doubled in 2022 compared to the average of preceding years, were sustained in 2023 at SGD 24 billion. As risk appetite returned in 2023, the ease of using our digital platforms acted as an additional spur for customers in converting their cash assets under management (AUM) to investments, boosting fee income growth.\n\nThird, credit costs were lowered as we used data analytics and artificial intelligence for early warning and portfolio management. Up until 2018, our credit costs had tended to be above the peer average. Since then, they have been consistently lower.\n\nThese improvements, which had been masked by low interest rates, became apparent in 2022 and more fully in 2023 as interest rates rose. The successful integration of Lakshmi Vilas Bank (LVB) in 2021 and Citigroup Inc.'s consumer banking business in Taiwan (Citi\n\nConsumer Taiwan) in 2023, significantly expanded our footprints in India and Taiwan, providing a solid foundation for improving their profitability. expanded our fo providing a solid their profitability\n\nWe believe these initiatives will enable us to sustain medium-term ROE at 15-17% after assuming more normalised interest rates and credit conditions. We believe these sustain mediumassuming more n credit conditions\n\n## Record performance in 2023 Record perf\n\nThe group's net interest income grew 25% to SGD 13.6 billion as full-year net interest margin expanded 40 basis points to 2.15%. Significantly, after an increase of 62 basis points in the four quarters of 2022, quarterly net interest margin continued to rise in the first three quarters of 2023, deviating from peers, before easing in the fourth quarter. The improvement was due to the repricing of floating-rate assets as well as a portion of fixed-rate assets. Deposit costs also increased, but at a slower rate as Casa outflows eased during the year. The group's net to SGD 13.6 billio margin expande Significantly, afte points in the fou net interest marg the first three qu from peers, befo quarter. The imp repricing of float\n\nNet interest income for the commercial book, which excluded Treasury Markets, rose by a faster 33% while its net interest margin increased 65 basis points to 2.76%. Higher funding costs and accounting asymmetry resulted in a bigger drag in Treasury Markets' net interest income as interest rates rose. The drag was partially offset by higher gains in Treasury Markets non-interest income.\n\nLoans were little changed at SGD 416 billion. Excluding Citi Consumer Taiwan, which added SGD 10 billion, underlying loans fell 1% or SGD 4 billion.\n\nTrade loans declined 8% or SGD 3 billion, accounting for most of the full-year decline in group loans, due to lower activity and unattractive pricing.\n\nNon-trade corporate loans were stable at SGD 246 billion. Although the loan pipeline was healthy, rising interest rates resulted in higher repayments from corporates that had spare cash on hand. By geography, growth in Singapore and India was offset by a decline in Greater China, where the greatest repayments occurred due to the significantly lower interest rates in the mainland.\n\nHousing loans were little changed as loan disbursements were offset by repayments. Disbursements were lower as new bookings declined from the previous year in line with market transactions after a new round of cooling measures in April 2023.\n\nOther consumer loans declined 2% or SGD 1 billion as wealth management customers repaid loans in a high interest rate environment.\n\nDeposits rose 3% to SGD 535 billion. Excluding Citi Consumer Taiwan, which added SGD 12 billion, underlying deposits\n\nwere stable. Casa outflows decelerated compared to the previous year and were replaced by fixed deposits. Liquidity remained ample, with liquidity coverage ratio of 144% and net stable funding ratio of 118% well above regulatory requirements.\n\nNet fee income grew 9% to SGD 3.38 billion. Card fees grew 22% to SGD 1.04 billion, crossing SGD 1 billion for the first time. Card spending reached a third consecutive record with travel spending surpassing prepandemic levels. The consolidation of Citi Consumer Taiwan also contributed to the growth in card fees.\n\nWealth management fees rose 13% to SGD 1.51 billion, reflecting strong net new money inflows, a shift from deposits to investments and bancassurance as risk appetite returned, and contributions from Citi Consumer Taiwan.\n\nLoan-related fees grew 21% to SGD 554 million. Investment banking fees increased 3% to SGD 125 million from higher debt and equity capital market activities. Transaction service fees fell 4% from lower trade finance and brokerage volumes.\n\nOther non-interest income rose 28% to SGD 3.15 billion. Treasury customer sales reached a record while Treasury Markets non-interest income was also higher.\n\nBy business unit, Consumer Banking/ Wealth Management income rose 35% to SGD 8.96 billion from higher interest rates and growth in wealth management product sales, cards, and loan fees. Wealth Management income increased to a record, with AUM growing 23% to a new high of SGD 365 billion, underpinned by strong net new money inflows and the consolidation of Citi Consumer Taiwan. Institutional Banking income grew 22% to SGD 9.36 billion as cash management income rose 73% from higher interest rates. Treasury Markets income declined 38% to SGD 725 million due to higher funding costs.\n\nBy region, Singapore income rose 26% to SGD 13.4 billion. Higher interest rates boosted net interest margin and more than offset a decline in loans. Non-interest income improved from higher treasury customer sales and growth in cards and wealth management fees. Hong Kong income increased 10% to SGD 3.21 billion, led by an expansion in net interest margin while non-interest income was little changed. Rest of Greater China benefited from the consolidation of Citi Consumer Taiwan as income grew 20% to SGD 1.40 billion with double-digit percentage increases in net interest income and non-interest income.\n\nExpenses rose 14% to SGD 8.06 billion led by an increase in staff costs from salary increments and a higher headcount.\n\nExcluding Citi Consumer Taiwan and nonrecurring technology and other costs, expenses rose 10% and the underlying costincome ratio was 39%.\n\nProfit before allowances grew 29% to a record SGD 12.1 billion.\n\n## Balance sheet remains strong\n\nAsset quality remained resilient throughout the year. Non-performing assets were little changed at SGD 5.06 billion and the nonperforming loans (NPL) ratio was unchanged at 1.1%. New non-performing asset formation remained low and was more than offset by repayments and write-offs. Specific allowances amounted to 11 basis points of loans or SGD 512 million, slightly above the eight basis points a year ago and remaining below the cycle average. General allowances of SGD 78 million were taken compared to a write-back of SGD 98 million in the previous year.\n\nTotal allowance reserves amounted to SGD 6.48 billion, comprising general allowance reserves of SGD 3.90 billion and specific allowance reserves of SGD 2.58 billion. Allowance coverage was at 128% and at 226% when collateral was considered.\n\nCapital remained strong, with the Common Equity Tier 1 ratio unchanged at 14.6%. The leverage ratio of 6.6% was more than twice the regulatory requirement of 3%.\n\n## Strengthened Taiwan franchise\n\nCiti Consumer Taiwan was consolidated on 12 August 2023, making DBS the largest foreign bank in Taiwan by assets with leading positions in deposits, cards and investments. The consolidation added SGD 10 billion to loans, SGD 12 billion to deposits and SGD 20 billion to investment assets under management. It also boosted DBS Taiwan's credit card accounts by five-fold to over 3 million.\n\n## Total shareholder returns boosted by higher dividends\n\nTotal shareholder returns for the calendar year amounted to 5%. We paid out a dividend of SGD 2.30 per share during the calendar year (consisting of fourth-quarter 2022 and first-quarter 2023 ordinary dividend of 42 cents each, second- and third-quarter 2023 ordinary dividend of 48 cents each, as well as a 2022 special dividend of 50 cents). The dividend partially offset a moderate share price decline of 2%.\n\n## Bonus issue and further increase in dividend\n\nThe Board proposed a final dividend of 54 cents per share, an increase of six cents\n\nfrom the previous payout. This brings the ordinary dividend for the financial year to SGD 1.92 per share, an increase of 42 cents or 28% from the previous full year.\n\nIn addition, the Board proposed a bonus issue on the basis of one bonus share for every existing 10 ordinary shares held. The bonus shares will qualify for dividend payments starting with the first-quarter 2024 interim dividend, increasing the pace of capital returns to shareholders. Barring unforeseen circumstances, the annualised ordinary dividend going forward will be SGD 2.16 per share over the enlarged share base, which is an increase of 24% from 2023.\n\n## Outlook\n\nAt time of writing, the macroeconomic outlook has become more settled after an extended period of uncertainty. There is consensus that interest rates have peaked and the debate is on the pace of reductions. The International Monetary Fund recently raised its forecast for global growth for 2024 from 2.9% previously to 3.1%, saying it saw a higher chance for a soft landing. With the greater clarity, consumer and investor confidence have also improved.\n\nThe better outlook will support our business prospects in the coming year. We expect net interest income to be maintained around 2023 levels as loan growth offsets the effects of a slightly lower net interest margin. Fee income should grow by doubledigit percentage terms. Wealth management should benefit from stronger investor confidence and the strong net new money inflows we have had, while cards should benefit from further growth in spending and travel. All these income streams will also benefit from the full-period impact of the Citi Consumer Taiwan consolidation.\n\nAlthough asset quality remains resilient, we are assuming credit costs will begin to normalise with specific allowances moving towards 17-20 basis points of loans. In the event that credit costs deteriorate beyond our assumptions, we have the capacity to release general allowance overlays that had been prudently built up in previous years.\n\nIf these forecasts hold, we expect full-year earnings for the coming year to be around the record levels in 2023, with ROE within our medium-term range of 15-17%.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nChng Sok Hui Chief Financial Officer DBS Group Holdings",

        "page_content": "## (A) Digitalisation\n\nIn 2023, we continued to make significant progress in digital transformation. For the consumer and SME businesses in Singapore and Hong Kong, the proportion of digital customers exceeded the 60% target set in 2017, reaching 62%. Income per customer and ROE for the digital segment continued to outperform that of traditional customers, affirming the value of digitalisation in enhancing customer engagement and operational efficiency. Digital customers generated three times the income on average than traditional ones, reflecting more diverse product holdings and more transactions. Having achieved our digital adoption target, focus shifted to intensifying efforts to capture larger wallet shares. At the investor day in May, we outlined our approach, including the use of data and AI/ ML models to generate hyper-personalised nudges, to drive increased product adoption and revenue per customer.\n\nBeyond the consumer and SME businesses in Singapore and Hong Kong, digital transformation became more pervasive across the organisation. At the investor day, we highlighted the expansion of digitalisation efforts in recent years to wealth management, transaction services and treasury customer sales across the region. The percentage of group income from these high-ROE segments rose from 40% in 2017 to 46% in 2022, and further increased to 52% in 2023, with income from wealth management, transaction services and treasury customer sales all achieving record levels. Our digital efforts in these areas, such as leveraging data and AI/ ML to provide relationship managers with insights to better engage their customers, and investments in API and core processing capabilities to seize opportunities in low-value real-time payments, supply chain financing and treasury customer solutions, advanced our goal of becoming the primary bank for an increasing number of wealth and business clients. This contributed to accelerated growth in foreign currency deposits and improved cross-sell into fee and treasury customer income-based activities.\n\n## Growth in high-ROE businesses\n\n## Income (as % of group)\n\n(1) Wealth income comprising Treasures, TPC and PB\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn our growth markets of India, Indonesia, China and Taiwan, we progressed in addressing historical sub-scale challenges by leveraging digitalisation. At the investor day, we explained our phygital approach in these markets, and outlined our aim to grow a high-quality base of consumer and SME customers and improve ROEs with increased scale. We effectively extended our reach through ecosystem partnerships by leveraging our extensive API and connectivity capabilities. We also scaled our business through inorganic acquisitions. In Taiwan, we acquired Citi Consumer Taiwan which positioned us as the largest foreign bank in Taiwan by assets with leading positions in deposits, cards and investments. The acquisition of LVB in 2020 was a similar move to boost scale. LVB significantly expanded our network and customer base in India, providing a scaled platform to overlay our digital banking capabilities. Since 2017, the cumulative growth in customers in our four growth markets, including from ecosystem partnerships and acquisitions, amounted to about eight million. During the same period, total income from these markets grew 84% while net profits surged by almost five-fold.\n\n## Digital share of customers (%)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Income multiple of digital vs. traditional\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## (B)  Business unit performance\n\nConsumer Banking/ Wealth Management total income grew 35% to SGD 8.96 billion. Net interest income rose 45% to SGD 6.2 billion from a higher net interest margin and growth in loan and deposit volumes. Non-interest income grew 16% to SGD 2.76 billion on higher investment product, bancassurance, card, and loan fees. Expenses increased 16% to SGD 4.41 billion. Total allowances rose 71% to SGD 270 million due mainly to higher specific provisions. Profit before tax increased by 59% to SGD 4.28 billion.\n\nInstitutional Banking total income rose 22% to SGD 9.36 billion, driven by stronger cash management income, offset by lower trade finance income. Expenses increased 10% to SGD 2.49 billion. Total allowances rose to SGD 88 million from a writeback of SGD 204 million a year ago due to a lower writeback from general allowances. Profit before tax rose 20% to SGD 6.79 billion.\n\nTreasury Markets total income decreased 38% to SGD 725 million mainly due to lower contributions from interest rate, credit and foreign exchange activities, partially offset by higher income from equity derivatives activities. Expenses increased 2% to SGD 630 million from higher business-related expenses.

        "page_content": "## (C)  Net interest income\n\nCommercial book net interest income, which excludes Treasury Markets, rose 33% to SGD 14.3 billion, driven by a 65-basispoint expansion in net interest margin to 2.76%. Yields on loans and other interestbearing assets repriced higher with interest rates. Although deposit costs also rose, the pace was slower compared to asset yields.\n\nThe growth in commercial book net interest income was moderated by a decline in Treasury Markets net interest income. Treasury Markets faced higher funding costs for its operations as interest rates rose. The drag on its net interest income was partially offset by gains in the non-interest income line.\n\nOverall net interest income grew 25% to SGD 13.6 billion.\n\nGross loans increased 1% or SGD 6 billion in constant-currency terms to SGD 422 billion. The consolidation of Citi Consumer Taiwan added SGD 10 billion to loans, more than offsetting a SGD 3 billion decline in trade loans resulting from lower activity and unattractive pricing. Non-trade corporate loans were stable. Despite a healthy loan pipeline, rising interest rates led to higher repayments. Additionally, there was a shift in China corporate borrowing to cheaper options onshore in the first half. Housing loans were little changed, with a SGD 1 billion growth in the fourth quarter offsetting a decline in the first nine months. Other consumer loans fell SGD 1 billion as wealth management customers repaid loans in a high interest rate environment.\n\nDeposits rose 3% or SGD 13 billion in constant-currency terms to SGD 535 billion. Citi Consumer Taiwan contributed SGD 12 billion, while underlying deposits were stable. Casa outflows decelerated compared to the previous year and were replaced by fixed deposits.\n\n## (D)  Non-interest income\n\nNet fee income rose 9% to SGD 3.38 billion. Card fees grew 22% to a new high of SGD 1.04 billion from higher spending and the consolidation of Citi Consumer Taiwan.\n\nWealth management fees rose 13% to SGD 1.51 billion, reflecting strong net new money inflows, a shift from deposits to investments and bancassurance, and contributions from Citi Consumer Taiwan.\n\n- (1) Includes trade & remittances, guarantees and deposit-related fees\n\nNet of interchange fees paid\n\n## Net interest margin (%)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Gross loans (SGD billion)\n\nConstant-currency change\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDeposits (SGD billion)\n\n## Constant-currency change\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n+13\n\n+12\n\n+37\n\n-35\n\n|                      | 2022   | 2023   |\n|----------------------|--------|--------|\n| Ratios (%)           |        |        |\n| Casa/ total deposits | 60     | 53     |\n| LDR                  | 79     | 78     |\n| LCR                  | 140    | 144    |\n| NSFR                 | 117    | 118    |\n\n## Fee income\n\n| (SGD million)                       | 2022   | 2023   | YoY%   |\n|-------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Investment banking                  | 121    | 125    | 3      |\n| Transaction services (1)            | 929    | 896    | (4)    |\n| Loan-related                        | 459    | 554    | 21     |\n| Cards (2)                           | 858    | 1,044  | 22     |\n| Wealth management                   | 1,330  | 1,505  | 13     |\n| Fee and commission income           | 3,697  | 4,124  | 12     |\n| Less: Fee and commission expense    | 606    | 740    | 22     |\n| Total net fee and commission income | 3,091  | 3,384  | 9      |\n\nFee income from other activities rose 4% as higher loan-related fees were partially offset by weaker transaction service fees as trade finance slowed.\n\nOther non-interest income rose 28% to SGD 3.15 billion. Treasury customer sales reached a record while Treasury Markets non-interest income was also higher.\n\n## (E)  Expenses\n\nExpenses rose 14% to SGD 8.06 billion led by a 15% increase in staff costs to SGD 5.04 billion. Excluding Citi Consumer Taiwan and non-recurring technology and other costs, expenses rose 10% and the underlying cost-income ratio was 39%.\n\n## (F)  Asset quality\n\nNon-performing assets were little changed at SGD 5.06 billion and the NPL ratio was unchanged at 1.1%. New non-performing asset formation remained low and was more than offset by repayments and write-offs.\n\nSpecific allowances amounted to SGD 512 million or 11 basis points of loans, slightly above the eight basis points a year ago and remaining below the cycle average. General allowances of SGD 78 million were taken compared to a SGD 98 million write-back a year ago.\n\nTotal allowance reserves amounted to SGD 6.48 billion. General allowance reserves stood at SGD 3.90 billion, which included SGD 2.20 billion of general allowance overlays. Specific allowance reserves amounted to SGD 2.58 billion. Allowance coverage of non-performing assets was at 128% and at 226% after considering collateral.\n\n## Other non-interest income\n\n| (SGD million)                                           | 2022   | 2023   |   YoY% |\n|---------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Net trading income                                      | 2,313  | 2,866  |     24 |\n| Net income from investment securities                   | 115    | 217    |     89 |\n| Others (include rental income and gain on fixed assets) | 42     | 71     |     69 |\n| Total                                                   | 2,470  | 3,154  |     28 |\n| Commercial book                                         | 1,518  | 1,785  |     18 |\n| Treasury Markets                                        | 952    | 1,369  |     44 |\n| Total                                                   | 2,470  | 3,154  |     28 |\n\n## Expenses (SGD million) (1)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| (SGD million)                                        | 2022    | 2023   |\n|------------------------------------------------------|---------|--------|\n| NPAs at start of period                              | 5,849   | 5,125  |\n| IBG and others                                       | (464)   | (311)  |\n| New NPAs                                             | 1,157   | 675    |\n| Upgrades, settlements and recoveries                 | (1,002) | (683)  |\n| Write-offs                                           | (619)   | (303)  |\n| CBG/ WM                                              | (112)   | (1)    |\n| Translation                                          | (148)   | (83)   |\n| NPAs at end of period                                | 5,125   | 4,730  |\n| Citi Consumer Taiwan                                 | -       | 326    |\n| NPAs at end of period including Citi Consumer Taiwan | 5,125   | 5,056  |\n| NPL ratio (%)                                        | 1.1     | 1.1    |\n| SP/ loans (bp)                                       | 8       | 11     |\n| Cumulative general and specific allowances as % of:  |         |        |\n| NPA                                                  | 122     | 128    |\n| Unsecured NPA                                        | 215     | 226    |",

        "page_content": "## CRO statement\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAsset quality remained healthy. With an evolving environment due to geopolitical tensions, we stayed vigilant to the potential impact on our portfolio. We continued to focus on delivering on our Technology Risk Management Uplift Programme to strengthen technology resiliency.\n\n## In \u0235 ation, rate hikes and recession risks\n\nIn 2023, most central banks continued to keep interest rates elevated as inflationary pressures persisted, raising risks of recession, refinancing challenges, and real estate price correction. Continued rate hikes and potential impasses in the United States debt ceiling exacerbated already volatile markets.\n\nNotwithstanding these headwinds, DBS' overall credit quality remained benign, with low non-performing loans rate at 1.1% and specific allowances at SGD 512 million. We stayed vigilant with portfolio reviews and stress tests on both the loan book and traded portfolio. Large corporates were assessed to be generally resilient due to their strong financial position and ability to pass on higher costs. While the SME corporates were assessed to be the most vulnerable, our SME portfolio had been stress-tested comprehensively in previous years and was mostly on a secured basis with acceptable financing quantum.\n\nUnsecured consumer credit loans which comprised less than 2% of our portfolio, saw an uptick in delinquency, which we mitigated by proactively intensifying collection actions. Residential mortgages, which were primarily in Singapore and Hong Kong, were mainly for owner-occupation and well-secured with low loan-to-value ratios. Regular and ad-hoc stress tests were also conducted during the year to evaluate the potential impact of adverse market prices on our traded portfolios.\n\nOverall, our portfolios were assessed to be resilient with the relevant risk mitigation strategies in place. DBS will continue to monitor the potential downstream effects.\n\n## Financial stability risks in western banks\n\nWith the failure of several US regional banks and Credit Suisse in early 2023, the year also saw one of the most significant system-wide banking stress periods since the 2008 global financial crisis. These stresses underscored the speed and scale of outflows through digital channels and how these could significantly contribute to liquidity stress.\n\nWhilst our liquidity profile remained healthy and well-diversified, we took the learnings from these events to heart, and critically evaluated our access to funding during periods of stress. Various initiatives were undertaken to strengthen our liquidity channels to ensure swift access to alternative liquidity sources when warranted. We also continued to engage our customers and deployed strategies to maintain our deposit base in a high interest rate environment.\n\nFurthermore, we reviewed our credit exposure to banks for potential similar balance sheet and liquidity issues, and our portfolio was generally assessed to be stable as our exposure was primarily to strong global systemically important banks.\n\n## Macroeconomic and geopolitical risks in North Asia\n\n2023 saw elevated macroeconomic and geopolitical risks in the region, underscored by uncertainties over China's economic recovery, risks to its real estate sector and escalating US-China tensions.\n\nDespite the challenges posed by China's weak consumer confidence and spending, and export weakness on the back of soft global demand, our portfolio remained resilient as our corporate exposure was mainly to top industry players, and consumer exposure was limited. While the real estate sector continued to face headwinds, our Chinese real estate exposures were mainly to larger and investment-grade names, with the remaining exposure generally well-secured. As contagion risks from the real estate market stayed elevated, we remained cautious and closely monitored our exposures.\n\nWe observed the imposition of restrictions by US and its allies which tightened China's access to advanced semiconductors and chipmaking gear. While there was no immediate impact to our portfolio, we continued to closely monitor the situation as it evolved.\n\nAs we continued to expand our presence in North Asia, our risk strategies were multipronged, including assessing our readiness in the event of tail risk scenarios such as business restrictions due to potential sanctions. Notwithstanding these, our focus continued to be on the longerterm opportunities in China, including risk strategies to support companies looking to diversify their supply chains and operations with a 'China plus one' strategy.\n\n## Fortifying customer trust with enhanced technology resilience\n\nAfter the digital disruption in March, the Board convened a Special Board Committee (SBC) to oversee a full review of the disruption and engaged two independent experts to support them. It also appointed an independent third party, Accenture, to carry out a root cause investigation of this incident and a subsequent one in May. The appointed party conducted a comprehensive review of the bank's digital banking services, including our control processes and technology stack. The findings of the review - completed in August - were also corroborated against subsequent disruptions.\n\nThrough the enhanced oversight, we believe that we have identified the key gaps and deficiencies, which are mainly in the areas of technology risk governance and oversight, incident management, system resilience and change management. To address these gaps and deficiencies, a comprehensive technology roadmap led by the CEO has been put in place to improve resiliency.\n\nThe Board Risk Management Committee (BRMC) established the BRMC Technology Risk Committee (BTRC) for dedicated oversight of technology risk. The BTRC oversees the implementation of the remedial measures that would be carried out to address the findings of the Accenture review and the completion of the technology roadmap.\n\nTo enhance independent checks and balances, we transferred the Technology Risk Management team to the Risk Management Group. Since then, a new Group Head of Technology Risk was onboarded and the team's bench strength expanded with specialised expertise. We strengthened our Site Reliability Engineering with new leadership and also created a new Quality Assurance function to provide an additional independent layer of verification, controls and checks over the bank's change management process. A new Group Technology Risk Committee (GTRC) was constituted to enhance the oversight and management of technology risk by senior management.\n\nRelating to incident management, we established clearer ownership and management of incidents within the bank, as well as between the bank and its service providers and vendors. We also embarked on proactive problem management through the active review of early warning indicators, identification of other possibly affected areas, and taking preventive actions.\n\nTo this end, a six-month pause on nonessential IT activities was instituted at DBS to focus on improving technology resiliency.\n\nRead more about 'Driving the resiliency and reliability of our technology' in the CIO statement.\n\n## Safe-guarding against evolving \u0234 nancial crime\n\nThe money laundering and sanctions threat landscape continued to evolve. Our investments in developing, deploying and operationalising new tools based on data analytics and artificial intelligence/ machine learning (AI/ ML) proved to be effective. In many cases, the tools demonstrated two to four times better detection than historical controls with greater efficiency of 10-30%. These capabilities were particularly effective at detecting and interdicting money laundering and sanctions evasion networks of shell companies. Notwithstanding this, criminals would likely alter their methods and we would need to devote efforts to preventing exploitation of citizenships in the consumer bank, as well as new techniques to increase customer protection against scams and the laundering of proceeds from scams.\n\nWe also actively participated in and contributed to many initiatives, both domestic and international.\n\nTo combat digital payment scams, we implemented new surveillance measures to detect malware and used AI to detect anomalies in customer account behaviour which could indicate a scam victim or a mule. We also introduced new self-managed security features like a Security Checkup Dashboard and DigiVault. DigiVault enables our customers to safekeep their money digitally, which was akin to a virtual safe deposit box. These measures added friction to the customer journey but were necessary to help our customers bank with us with peace of mind. We also regularly collaborated with law enforcement agencies in their operations. For example, a onemonth joint operation with the Singapore Police Force in mid-2023 mitigated over SGD 21 million in potential scam losses.\n\nRead more about 'Preventing Financial Crime' in the Sustainability Report.\n\n## Risks from climate change\n\nClimate change posed long-term change to risks on our portfolio, and banks had a crucial role to play in moderating how we lend to highrisk sectors. In 2023, we focused on enhancing environment, social and governance (ESG) risk capabilities including integrating ESG risk assessments into credit risk underwriting, establishing a centralised data repository to support climate risk with business intelligence, and enhancing scenario analysis models for transition risk assessment.\n\nAlongside such developments, we also invested widely in our people, with over 1,800 relationship and credit managers completing comprehensive climate activation training programmes in 2023.\n\nRead more about 'Responsible Financing' in the Sustainability Report.\n\n## Transforming risk management through digitalisation and AI\n\nBuilding on our long-standing track record of leveraging digitalisation, this year's initiatives spanned various risk types, including improvements in our risk management capabilities and workflows in collateral management, credit control and liquidity risk management.\n\nWe continued maturing the use of AI/ ML for credit underwriting and early warning for the consumer and SME banking businesses. These enhancements enabled scale and speed with efficiency to drive greater business success, improve customer experiences, and strengthen risk management.\n\nSince 2019, our efforts in this area have yielded numerous benefits, such as generating deeper risk insights into our portfolios and improving fraud detection. By leveraging non-traditional data, we were also able to expand our addressable market\n\nin the consumer and SME space, with multifold increases in new loan applications and book size in ecosystem lending.\n\nAs we expanded the use of data and analytics in DBS, we remained focused on ensuring our data governance capabilities are fit for purpose. Our data governance framework was developed along three prisms: (a) a baseline prism (data security, data quality, and legal and regulatory compliance), (b) an ethical prism - PURE (Purposeful, Unsurprising, Respectful and Explainable) for the responsible use of data, and (c) an AI governance prism (AI/ ML based systems and models), including the new and amplified risks associated with Gen AI.\n\n## Navigating new business risks\n\nWhile we have a larger footprint in India post full integration of Lakshmi Vilas Bank at the end of the last year, the portfolio, primarily consisting of lending to large corporates with a growing SME and consumer book, remained resilient and stable.\n\nThe integration of Citigroup Inc.'s consumer banking business in Taiwan was completed in August 2023. To effectively manage the risks associated with a larger franchise, we have deepened the expertise of our risk management team and strengthened processes.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSoh Kian Tiong Chief Risk Officer DBS Group Holdings\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u00b7 Strengthen technology resilience through governance, people/ leadership, systems and processes\n- \u00b7 Proactively monitor emerging economic challenges and geopolitical developments and implications for our portfolios\n- \u00b7 Continue to strengthen risk management capabilities and streamline end-to-end processes and controls across all markets\n- \u00b7 Enhance climate risk management and stress testing capabilities\n- \u00b7 Continue to mitigate financial crime and cyber threats through controls, systems, analytics and effective communication",

We are making good progress in delivering on our technology resiliency roadmap, which will improve our digital service availability and reliability. We continue to invest in our people and technology to ensure a di \u038d erentiated customer experience.\n\n## 2023 overview\n\n2023 was an eventful year for Technology and Operations, with the digital disruptions underscoring the need for technological enhancements, particularly in areas such as improving digital service availability and recovery. The shift from a monolithic mainframe to a cloud-native, microservicesbased approach in our digital transformation journey enabled us to be more nimble and increased the speed of execution. However, this created a more complex infrastructure requiring additional operational rigour and oversight. The six-month pause on non-essential IT activities imposed by the regulator is an opportune period for us to redirect our resources towards improving and tightening our processes in change management, system resilience, incident management, and technology risk governance.\n\nDespite the digital disruptions, there were significant achievements, including the successful integration of Citigroup Inc.'s consumer banking business in Taiwan (Citi Consumer Taiwan) and the launch of new products in DBS Bank India. We also adopted new ways of working in a horizontal organisation by Managing through Journeys (MtJs) and incorporating Gen AI to improve our services.\n\n## Driving the resiliency and reliability of our technology\n\nTo effectively manage the complex tapestry\n\nof technology risks and strengthen the bank's capabilities, we are implementing a comprehensive roadmap through the Technology Risk Management Uplift programme (T-Up), which is chaired by the CEO. Through the T-Up programme, we are putting in place a more stringent process for change management. We are also establishing clear ownership and management of digital disruptions within the bank and with our service providers. We have reinforced governance by dedicating resources to technology risk oversight and monitoring the implementation of remedial measures. This roadmap will culminate in improved service availability and reliability.\n\n## Change management\n\nDBS has a microservices architecture, which is supported via a number of thirdparty systems. While this is the preferred architecture for most modern technology companies, the one challenge it poses is that a bug in one part of the ecosystem could result in previously unknown problems elsewhere. This underscores the importance of doing more rigorous and comprehensive testing before we put any software into production. We have since tightened our change management controls and created a near-production test environment to allow for more robust testing of key services before going live with new changes or releases.\n\n## System resilience\n\nWe recognise that customers expect to have access to key services such as\n\nbalance enquiry and digital payments in an uninterrupted manner. To ensure that these services have minimal downtime, for critical applications, we have now added hot standby capabilities to supplement existing active-active configurations. Additionally, today, some of our services are delivered through common/ shared systems, which can potentially result in single points of failure. To prevent this, we are decoupling these shared systems at both the front and back ends so that key services are always available on at least one channel. This will be completed by 1Q 2024. these critica stand active today throu can p failur these back availa comp\n\nTo complement our engagement with vendors, we have established 10 Centres of Excellence (COEs) that house expertise across different domains. The COEs will drive standardisation of architecture and reuse of assets, uphold quality service delivery, and develop competency for shared application software and services. To co vendo of Exc acros stand asset devel ft\n\nOur mobile applications have been enhanced to detect and remove the presence of malware. Our cybersecurity control environment is regularly tested and attained the highest tier of preparedness for the Cyber Trust mark.\n\n## Incident management\n\nWhen incidents arise, we have to recover services more quickly. Having early warning indicators, and a process to review internal alerts proactively, enable us to take preventive actions in a timely manner. In the last year, having built comprehensive diagnostic capabilities, real-time monitoring data and alerts are now being leveraged as part of our incident management process. This encompasses a comprehensive view starting with the end-to-end customer journey through the applications and infrastructure levels to detect and drill down issues in real time and identify solutions swiftly.\n\nWe have centralised our command centre to enable faster identification, triaging and initiation of recovery protocols. Playbooks for technology operations teams and Crisis Situation Managers have been updated with a sharper focus on rapid restoration of alternate systems to minimise interruption of our digital services. These capabilities are available in Singapore and will be rolled out across all our markets in 2024.\n\n## Technology risk governance and oversight\n\nTo strengthen technology risk governance and oversight, the bank formed a new subcommittee of the Board Risk Management Committee (BRMC) called the BRMC Technology Risk Committee. The bank also transferred the Technology Risk Management team to the Risk Management Group, reporting to the Chief Risk Officer, to enhance independent checks and balances. In addition, we bolstered our Site Reliability Engineering team with new leadership and established a\n\ndedicated Quality Assurance (QA) function. The QA function serves as an independent layer of checks on change management within Group Technology. In addition, we are reinforcing a strong technology risk and control mindset among our technology teams, ensuring an equal emphasis across delivery, innovation and resilience.\n\n## Executing integrations for continued business growth\n\nThe integration of Citi Consumer Taiwan with DBS Bank Taiwan has solidified our position as the largest foreign bank in the market. This complex exercise encompassed enhancements to local systems, testing operational readiness, ensuring smooth network performance, and facilitating transactions like cheque handling. As a result of this integration, we welcomed 3,000 new employees into DBS. We will optimise the post-integration processes and deliver integrated solutions across a comprehensive range of services, from credit card onboarding to remittance.\n\nTo build a competitive position in the rapidly growing Indian market, through the integration of Lakshmi Vilas Bank, we expanded our product suite to include gold loans and retail depository accounts, and introduced new products such as proprietary credit cards and affordable housing loans. The India team also executed a data onshoring project to meet regulatory requirements. The integration expanded our network to over 520 branches and 900 ATMs, further growing our physical presence in India.\n\n## Generating value from technology\n\n## Digitalising operations\n\nOur Operations Processes and Platform Re-engineering programme has improved employee productivity by over a million hours since 2021. The digitalisation of operations has contributed to a 54% reduction in risk incidents despite a doubling in transaction volumes.\n\nOur workflow system, called Intelligent Business Process Management, reduces manual hand-offs and digitalises our processes. Over 1,100 processes have been standardised and digitalised, reducing risk and manual effort. For instance, Treasury Market Operations have achieved a digitalisation rate of 85%, Institutional Banking Group Operations 80%, and Consumer Banking Group Operations 67%. We will see further improvement in our digitalisation rates as we roll out these processes in different markets. We are confident that Gen AI capabilities will further streamline and automate our processes, providing smoother customer journeys and reducing employee toil.\n\n## AI and Gen AI\n\nOur investments in building AI capabilities enable the pervasive use of AI throughout the bank. Today, we have over 800 models and 350 use cases delivering SGD 370 million in economic benefit, more than twice the value in 2022. In particular, our AI-driven real-time digital fraud prevention solution flags potentially fraudulent transactions in under 10 milliseconds.\n\nIn 2023, DBS experimented with Gen AI to drive innovation and enhance operational efficiency. An enterprise Gen AI platform equipped with robust safeguards enabled employees to develop use cases and assess the efficacy of prototypes developed. All Gen AI pilots undergo risk assessments and added human oversight.\n\nOur experiments in areas such as summarisation, generative communications, personalised wealth advisory, contact centre, coding and development show promising outcomes. For instance, integrating Gen AI to assist our Customer Service Officers with real-time transcription and call summarisation will reduce the average call handling time by up to 20%.\n\nIn addition to our principles for responsible use of data, we continue enhancing our artificial intelligence and machine learning model governance with the implementation of the Fairness, Ethics, Accountability and Transparency principles from the Monetary Authority of Singapore.\n\n## Nurturing our next generation of talents\n\nWe are committed to cultivating a diverse, future-ready workforce by fostering a culture of innovation, growth and customer centricity in our employees. The DBS Future Tech Academy, designed to build deep technical expertise and thought leadership, has registered over 200,000 module completions. We have strengthened manpower resources by bolstering our bench strength, accelerating onboarding, and providing upskilling opportunities for future roles.\n\nThese efforts have yielded positive results, with our regional Technology and Operations engagement score increasing by three percentage points to a record 91%. This is higher than the APAC Best Employer benchmark by six percentage points, and the APAC Financial Services Institution benchmark by 18 percentage points. The uplift was driven by improved survey followups, enhanced rewards and recognition, as well as learning and growth opportunities through internal mobility.\n\n## Upskilling for emerging roles\n\nIt is essential to enable our employees to\n\nfully leverage AI. Our Data Chapter team develops learning pathways that equip employees to be AI-ready with relevant skills and tools, and enables them to incorporate AI and Gen AI techniques into our bank-wide processes. More than 2,900 employees benefitted from upskilling across four future operations roles. Additionally, 90% of our Operations employees have completed more than 75% of their two-year role-based Structured Learning Roadmaps curriculum.\n\n## Women in Tech\n\nAs we advance our Women in Tech agenda, we are heartened that two of our technologists were recognised in the SG100WIT hall of fame last year. We also partnered with United Women Singapore to pilot a series of workshops for female students in secondary schools, covering topics like blockchain, smart contracts and cryptocurrency.\n\n## Committing to joyful banking and seamless customer journeys\n\nOur commitment to making banking joyful and seamless remains unwavering. We are making good progress in delivering on our technology resiliency roadmap, which will improve our digital service availability and reliability. We continue to invest in our people and technology to ensure a differentiated customer experience.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nHan Kwee Juan Acting Chief Information Officer & Singapore Country Head DBS Group Holdings\n\nKey priorities for 2024\n\n- \u00b7 Fortify technology capabilities and resiliency to better manage risks and strengthen service recovery\n- \u00b7 Continue to re-platform legacy systems\n- \u00b7 Leverage the power of AI to improve our processes and ensure a differentiated customer experience\n- \u00b7 Build and cultivate a futureready Operations workforce, equipped for redesigned roles in tomorrow's world",

Deepening customer relationships continued to be a key priority as we sought to help clients achieve business goals and navigate sustainability challenges.\n\n## 2023 overview\n\nAgainst a backdrop of economic uncertainty and subdued trade flows, the Institutional Banking Group (IBG) business demonstrated resilience.\n\nRecord financials, boosted by higher net interest margins, reflected the strength of our diversified franchise and quality of execution to strategy. Our extensive Asia network and connectivity enabled us to capture opportunities arising from outbound investments from China and elsewhere, as companies looked towards alternative supply sources and production bases in South and Southeast Asia. Deepening client relationships continued to be a key priority underpinned by our industry expertise, digital capabilities and sustainability leadership. At the same time, demand for sustainable and transition financing accelerated in line with the urgent need for climate action.\n\n## Robust \u0234 nancials despite macro challenges\n\nIBG's total income rose 22% to a record SGD 9.36 billion in 2023. Net interest income grew 28% from net interest margin expansion, prudent and nimble deposit pricing, as well as sustained volumes.\n\nNon-interest income grew 4% to a record SGD 2.20 billion, underpinned by healthy\n\ngrowth in loan and cash management fees from deepening customer relationships. Our focus on growing real-time payments and improving client journeys also contributed to the strong cash management performance. Trade fees fell from the previous year, impacted by a subdued market.\n\nAllowances stayed low as asset quality remained healthy. Profit before tax grew 20% to SGD 6.79 billion, driven by a higher interest rate environment, robust noninterest income and a lower cost-income ratio of 27%, compared to 29% in FY2022.\n\n## Strengthening our franchise across industries and markets\n\nThere was broad-based growth across our industry segments especially in Real Estate (RE), Energy, Renewables and Infrastructure (ERI), Telecoms, Media and Technology (TMT) and Financial Institutions (FI).\n\nThe RE industry group benefitted from growing demand across a wider cross-section of clients looking to invest in prime assets in gateway cities across the region. The ERI industry group continued to see good momentum in the financing of renewables and capital recycling, driven by Asia's accelerating energy transition. Supply chain diversification contributed to increased regional activity in the TMT sector as clients sought to expand operations beyond China.\n\nRevenue from the FI group reached new highs, crossing the billion-dollar mark for the first time as we successfully captured private capital flows to Asia, supported by healthy non-interest income. By leveraging our digital capabilities, we strengthened our value proposition and expanded coverage in geographies including the Middle East, United Kingdom and Australia. g g the first time a private capital healthy non-in our digital cap value proposit in geographies United Kingdo\n\nWork to deepen our franchise across our core markets continued at pace. Our ongoing efforts to dial up customer centricity contributed to increased market penetration among large corporates across our six core markets - moving us from second to first place on the Coalition Greenwich survey index. Work to deepe our core mark Our ongoing e centricity cont penetration am across our six from second t Greenwich sur\n\nIn China, we had to be agile to leverage opportunities amid the challenges posed by a soft reopening and structural headwinds. Our extensive network and capabilities in Asia's key axes of growth put us in good stead to support companies looking to diversify their supply chains abroad. We also launched a foreign direct investment advisory desk in Singapore to capture business opportunities emanating from Asia's largest economy. In China, we ha opportunities a soft reopenin Our extensive\n\nIndonesia and India delivered solid performance as we expanded our client footprint amid robust growth driven by domestic demand.\n\n## Scaling Global Transaction Services with digital connectivity and trade propositions\n\nOur Global Transaction Services business continued to be a strategic priority, delivering over 50% of institutional banking revenue.\n\nDigital capabilities enabled us to deliver more meaningful cash management solutions to customers in Singapore and across the region. Real-time payment volume grew by more than 50%, which when combined with an increased market share for cross-border payments, led to higher fees. This was driven by active commercialisation and regionalisation of our digital products and services, as well as the implementation of over 1,000 new cash management mandates across the region. Nimble pricing strategies for deposits, underpinned by artificial intelligence/ machine learning (AI/ ML) tools, meant that we could respond more quickly to volatile market conditions.\n\nIn addition, we were able to help regional customers deposit their monies with us more seamlessly with the launch of new online fixed deposit services across all our core locations. The market response was resounding - in Singapore, we garnered SGD 6.5 billion in online fixed deposits as at\n\nend December 2023. This contributed to an increase of over 20% in the fixed deposit book.\n\nIn trade, our AI/ ML capabilities and use of data-driven tools for underwriting powered sustained growth in supply chain financing. Documentary trade loans fell due to unattractive pricing and a slowdown in trade volume.\n\nNotwithstanding this, we continued leveraging opportunities in the creation of digital trade corridors across the region. In August, we successfully completed the first interoperable electronic bills of lading transaction between Singapore and India. The transaction was implemented under the TradeTrust framework, an initiative by the Infocomm Media Development Authority and supported by Enterprise Singapore.\n\n## Leveraging digital capabilities to enhance client engagement\n\nData and digitalisation continued to underpin our efforts to deliver stickier and deeper customer relationships as we integrated our solutions into customer and industry ecosystems. API calls grew 61% as more customers embedded our digital solutions into their businesses.\n\nOur digital proposition was especially key to our SME franchise. By leveraging AI/ ML, we enhanced our digital servicing capabilities and client engagement to deliver a more tailored customer experience.\n\n## Enabling the path to net zero with meaningful partnerships and innovative solutions\n\nAs the first bank in Southeast Asia to set decarbonisation targets, our priority has been to provide practical solutions to enable our clients - from large corporates to SMEs to execute their sustainability agendas. With increasing momentum around the need to create environmental and social impact, our sustainable financing commitments, net of repayments, was around SGD 70 billion as at end December 2023.\n\nIn 2023, we pioneered several innovative solutions to grow our ESG portfolio. For example, DBS partnered apparel giant, H&M Group, to develop a first-of-its-kind collaborative finance tool to accelerate supply chain decarbonisation in the apparel sector. We completed the first successful transaction with a textile supplier in India, to fund the installation of low-carbon technologies in their factory. This in turn contributes towards H&M Group's supply chain emissions targets. DBS also became the first bank in Hong Kong to combine energy saving loans and deposits together with subsidies to SMEs for the\n\n| SGD million              | 2023   | 2022   | YoY%   |\n|--------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Total income             | 9,357  | 7,688  | 22     |\n| Expenses                 | 2,489  | 2,254  | 10     |\n| Profit before allowances | 6,868  | 5,434  | 26     |\n| Allowances               | 88     | (204)  | NM     |\n| Profit before tax        | 6,787  | 5,638  | 20     |\n\npurchase of renewable energy certificates from local energy provider, CLP Power.\n\nIn addition to financing solutions, we also expanded our ecosystem partnerships and advisory services to SMEs. As at end 2023, we formalised collaborations with several industry-leading solution providers including Keppel Corp, Schneider Electric and Univers. We engaged over 1,000 companies through various sustainability training courses and programmes to develop their capability and capacity in the field. We also strengthened our in-house capability, by providing sustainability training to over 1,800 relationship and credit risk managers.\n\nAdditionally, DBS played an active role in various industry and policy workgroups to help advance the region's transition finance agenda. For example, as a member of the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero, we co-chaired the workgroup to develop a proposal for the managed phaseout of thermal coal in Asia Pacific. DBS is also a key participant and enabler in the ChinaSingapore Green Finance Taskforce that was set up in 2023.\n\n## Leading in Asian bond markets\n\nCapital markets activity was muted in 2023. Despite this, DBS continued to maintain pole position in the SGD bond markets, while also gaining market share across regional bond markets.\n\n## Scaling and maturing a new way of working\n\nIn 2023, we continued to scale our Managing through Journeys (MtJs) approach. To deliver better customer experiences, we expanded MtJs into two new areas - corporate documentary trade, as well as domestic payments, collections, and merchant solutions.\n\nBy breaking down internal silos and redesigning our processes to be more customer-centric, we have been able to shorten processing times and facilitate a more joyful banking experience. In just six months, we embedded a horizontal framework to streamline corporate documentary trade processes across our six core markets, enabling more seamless transactions via digital solutions. Similarly, more efficient\n\nprocesses reduced the turnaround time needed for corporates to implement our digital payments and collections solutions in Singapore, Hong Kong and India.\n\n## Looking ahead\n\nWe expect a softening of net interest margins as tailwinds from a high-rate environment ease in 2024. Geopolitical uncertainty, market volatility and climate risk will continue to shape the landscape.\n\nTo help clients successfully navigate these challenges, we will need to leverage our strength as an Asia-centric bank to deliver value, at scale. Our deep local knowledge and extensive regional footprint, enabled by digital capabilities, put us in a strong position to capitalise on regional investment and trade flows as supply chains continue to diversify.\n\nAt the same time, sustainability will continue to be high on national and corporate agendas, as a growing urgency for climate action raises the stakes for a just energy transition. We aim to build on our leadership in sustainability to channel capital towards green and transition activities to help create a more sustainable future.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTan Su Shan Institutional Banking DBS Group Holdings\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 2024 Focus Areas\n\n- \u00b7 Strengthen technology resilience\n- \u00b7 Enhance credit vigilance, knowyour-customer and anti-money laundering and credit processes\n- \u00b7 Amplify connectivity strategy to capture foreign direct investment and trade flows\n- \u00b7 Dial up solutions and partnerships to enable a just transition",

The success of our franchise is tied to how best we can tap our technology, assets and people to create innovative solutions and opportunities for all, including those with the fewest resources, to help them achieve their aspirations.\n\n## 2023 overview\n\nDespite the rapidly evolving macroeconomic environment, Consumer Banking/ Wealth Management delivered strong results and maintained a healthy balance sheet. We benefitted from the tailwinds that came through higher interest rates, although growth was partially offset by softening demand for loans. Business momentum was sustained by net new money flows into the region, and higher fee income generated through increased productivity and greater use of artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ ML). We concluded the integration of Citigroup Inc.'s consumer banking business in Taiwan (Citi Consumer Taiwan), making DBS the biggest foreign bank by assets in Taiwan. We will continue to build out our business footprint, providing more value for our customers by helping them to navigate any financial uncertainty and grow their wealth.\n\n## Strong broad-based interest and fee income growth\n\nWe delivered record earnings, propelled by broad-based interest and fee income growth. Our total income rose 35% to SGD 8.96 billion, due to substantial net interest income margin expansion and growth in wealth management fees. All six core markets delivered high double-digit income\n\ngrowth. With an improved cost-income ratio, net profit before tax grew 59% to SGD 4.28 billion.\n\nNet interest income rose 45% to SGD 6.2 billion, driven by higher Fed rates and stronger deposit earnings in most of our markets. The growth was however moderated by margin compression in our asset portfolio. Overall, we still saw resilient growth in balances.\n\nNon-interest income grew to SGD 2.76 billion due to higher investments and bancassurance product sales, cards and unsecured loan-related fees. Card fees rose 22% to SGD 1.04 billion, as travel spending surpassed pre-pandemic levels in all markets.\n\nDespite intensifying competition, we upheld our market share lead in savings deposits, cards and the mortgage loan space in Singapore. The bancassurance business maintained its lead in Singapore for new business market share and we also became the market leader in digital bancassurance offerings.\n\n## Wealth Management: Sustained growth buoyed by rising wealth fees and robust family o \u025d ce practice\n\nOur wealth franchise continued to build on last year's record outperformance, with total wealth management income climbing 35% to SGD 4.43 billion.\n\nWe gained market share in our Family Office business - DBS Private Bank onboarded more than a third of the 1,100 Single Family Offices set up in Singapore. As the first private bank in the world to launch a Multi Family Office proposition leveraging Singapore's Variable Capital Company (VCC) regime, we have attracted keen interest from ultra-high-networth clients looking to consolidate their wealth in Singapore. Our Family Office AUM continued its growth trajectory and grew 21% in 2023.\n\nOur clients have also gone beyond conventional norms of passive charitable giving towards impact investing, partnering the DBS Foundation to provide support to businesses for impact in the region. In March 2023, we announced the first close of the Asia Impact First Fund, which we launched together with Heritas Capital to help innovative and high-growth social enterprises across Asia to scale and create greater social and environmental impact. We committed 50% of the over USD 20 million that was raised.\n\nWe continued to help more clients do well by doing good, further raising the bar on ESG investing. Currently, more than 50% of our clients' investment assets are made up of 'sustainable investments' (MSCI BBB-rating). We enabled this by driving client advocacy, proactively conducting portfolio reviews, and making it easier for our clients to understand the ESG ratings of their portfolios.\n\nTestament to the strides we have made, our wealth management business continued to be recognised globally. We were named 'Asia's Best Bank for Wealth Management' by Euromoney for the second year running and clinched 'Best Private Bank in Asia Pacific' from Global Finance for the fifth year running. One of the first-time wins included 'Best Private Bank - Asia' from The Asset.\n\n## Consumer Banking: Driving \u0234 nancial inclusivity through 'phygital' engagement and ecosystem partnerships\n\nOne of our key differentiators is our phygital approach, which combines our digital capabilities with the expertise of frontline branch staff and wealth managers to serve the needs of clients and customers worldwide.\n\nData analytics and AI/ML have been critical enablers to deepening customer\n\nengagement.

Under the twoyear support initiative, we contributed SGD 1 million, which includes the government's dollar-for-dollar matching, to the Digital for Life movement and stepped up our volunteer participation to jointly launch community programmes and organise workshops to raise digital and financial literacy.\n- \u00b7 Through our People of Purpose movement, our employee volunteers have been running workshops that will reach 100,000 Singaporeans and residents across various community segments, such as youths, persons with disabilities, seniors and hawkers over the next two years.\n- \u00b7 In 2023, we reached out to 59,000 participants via some 400 digital and financial literacy workshops or initiatives.\n\n## Neighbours \u0234 rst, bankers second\n\nSince our founding in 1877, we have stayed true to our mission of being the 'People's Bank'. We take pride in serving generations of Singaporeans, from creating a nationwide savings movement, to playing a key role in the development of Singapore, and in recent years, driving digital literacy in the community. Till today, our aim as Singapore's oldest and most loved bank is to always be at the forefront of providing pioneering \u0234 nancial solutions that cater to the evolving needs of Singaporeans. They include children, young adults, families, seniors and the community at large. We remain committed to giving back to the community and standing alongside Singaporeans, as we widen our reach to more vulnerable segments through various initiatives.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## For children and families\n\n## POSB Smart Buddy Programme\n\n- \u00b7 We made good progress in extending the world's first integrated in-school savings and payments programme to more schools. The POSB Smart Buddy programme, which was launched in 2017, creates a contactless payments ecosystem within the school environment to help cultivate sensible savings and spending habits among young students in an interactive, engaging manner. These students are then better equipped to achieve financial wellness when they transition to the next stage of their lives. grated ools. in 2017, ool g habits r. ncial ves.\n- \u00b7 We signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Ministry of Education (MOE) to install a digital payment infrastructure in more than 330 primary and secondary schools, junior colleges/ Millennia Institute, and special education (SPED) schools by 2025. Under the partnership, we will also provide up to 400,000 students with smartwatches and cards for payments.\n- \u00b7 Today, some 160,000 students in 170 schools are using Smart Buddy smartwatches and/ or smart cards for digital payments, up from the 70,000 students across 100 schools in 2022. The programme also supports needy students under the MOE Financial Assistance Scheme. To date, the number of students who are receiving meal subsidies via POSB Smart Buddy has nearly tripled to 17,000 students.\n- \u00b7 To spark children's interest in financial literacy, we partnered visual education specialist Eyeyah! to curate an exhibition using animation and life-sized ATMs to bring to life concepts of saving and thrifting. The exhibition drew more than 770,000 visitors across schools, libraries and public fairs.\n- \u00b7 As part of the bank's support measures to help ease cost-of-living pressures, we also provided school allowance subsidies of up to SGD 2 a week to 21,000 eligible students in 2023.\n\n## POSB PAssion Run for Kids\n\n- \u00b7 Singapore's longest-running race of its kind returned in full force in 2023 with over 9,000 participants. Jointly organised by POSB and the People's Association (PA), the event is the largest charity kids run in Singapore.\n- \u00b7 The event raised a record SGD 1.24 million for the POSB PAssion Kids Fund this year. In all, we have raised close to SGD 13 million , with more than 869,000 children benefitting from 229 programmes .\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## For seniors\n\n- \u00b7 We stepped up our digital literacy programmes for seniors in the community. We extended these programmes to hawker centres and also created a new anti-scam and cybersecurity quiz that was codeveloped with the Cyber Security Agency of Singapore and IMDA.\n- \u00b7 In partnership with DBS Foundation and IMDA, we pioneered a new series of edutainment roadshows which incorporated digital literacy workshops with Getai entertainment to better reach out to the seniors and enhance their learning.\n- \u00b7 Besides deepening collaborations with agencies such as IMDA, RSVP SG, the Council for Third Age and PA, we worked with new partners such as TOUCH Community Services to empower more seniors. We were a key partner of IMDA's Digital for Life Festival, which involved more than 30,000 participants and visitors.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## For the students, working adults and migrant workers\n\n- \u00b7 We partnered community partners, SPED schools and social service agencies to organise regular financial literacy workshops for kids and those with special needs. These sessions included bank branch visits to familiarise participants with banking services.\n- \u00b7 In line with our priority to help customers achieve financial wellness, we also partnered several organisations such as Central Provident Fund (CPF) Board, National Trades Union Congress (NTUC), the Institute of Technical Education (ITE) to organise physical and virtual workshops/ seminars where students and working adults, including gig workers, learn how to better save, invest and plan for their retirement. In 2023, more than 28,000 ITE students took part in the financial literacy classes.\n- \u00b7 POSB remains the only bank to work with the Migrant Workers' Centre and Centre for Domestic Employees to set up banking accounts for more than 900,000 migrant workers and foreign domestic workers. To deepen our engagement with them, we also organised digital literacy workshops for more than 5,000 migrant workers.

During the annual Board strategy o \u038a site (which was held in September 2023), the Board actively deliberated on, inter alia :\n\n- (i) the digital wave in AI and generative AI (Gen AI);\n- (ii) revalidating DBS' Asia strategy for sustained growth; and\n- (iii) building our North Asia resilience.\n\n## Technology Matters\n\nThe Board had in-depth discussions and reviews on the initiatives to strengthen our technology architecture and resiliency, in light of the digital disruptions during the course of 2023.\n\nIn March 2023, the Board established a Special Board Committee (SBC), chaired by the Lead Independent Director, comprising certain members of the Board and supported by external subject matter experts. This committee, with support from Accenture, oversaw the development of a comprehensive technology resiliency roadmap. The BTRC was set up in September 2023 and has assumed the responsibilities previously held by the SBC. It will continue to closely monitor the progress of our remedial activities, and ensure ongoing diligence and oversight in addressing technology-related challenges. In conjunction with these e \u038a orts, a Technology Risk Management Uplift (T-Up) Programme, chaired by the CEO was also established.\n\nPlease refer to sections \"Letter from Chairman & CEO\", \"CRO statement\" and \"CIO statement\" in the Annual Report for a more in-depth description on our response to the digital disruptions, the technology resiliency roadmap and the T-Up Programme.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Sustainability and ESG\n\nThe Board remained committed to sustainability and environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues.\n\nDBS continued to embed ESG considerations into our business strategy, re \u038c ecting our dedication to responsible banking, responsible business practices and creating impact beyond banking. The Board rea \u038d rmed and endorsed our overall sustainability strategy to be 'Best Bank for a Better World' by creating business opportunities while solving the critical challenges facing society, such as climate change, aging population and income equality, among others. The Board also actively supported sustainable \u038b nance initiatives, funding projects and businesses that have a positive impact on society and the environment. To that end, in 2023, DBS announced a commitment of up to SGD 1 billion, over the next 10 years, to improve the lives and livelihoods of the low-income and underprivileged and foster a more inclusive society.\n\n## People and Culture\n\nPeople and culture were another area of focus for the Board in 2023. The CEO updated the Board on the 2023 employee survey \"MyVoice\", and noted that (i) overall MyVoice engagement had been on an upward trend since 2015; (ii) all key indices in MyVoice had witnessed an improvement; (iii) most core markets have increased\n\nin engagement and outperformed the respective country \u038b nancial services industry scores; and (iv) increase in MyVoice scores across most units within the Bank.\n\nThe Board discussed people and leadership matters, including the need to focus on employees and to provide clear career paths for employees and to drive gender, intergenerational and foreign talent diversity and inclusion. The Board was also updated on (i) e \u038a orts relating to culture and employee experience and integration of the workforce of Citigroup Inc.'s consumer banking business in Taiwan (Citi Consumer Taiwan), and (ii) the Group's focus on continuously refreshing leaders, and promoting internal successors with strong innovative, collaborative and growth mindsets.\n\n## Pursuing Inorganic Acquisitions and New Business Initiatives\n\nThe Board reviewed and deliberated on several inorganic acquisitions and new business initiatives. These transactions included the (i) completion of the acquisition of Citi Consumer Taiwan; and (ii) acquisition of an additional stake in Shenzhen Rural Commercial Bank, increasing our shareholding from 13% to 16.69%. The Board also deliberated on the risks arising from new business initiatives and ensured that appropriate risk management and governance policies and procedures were put in place to manage these.\n\n## Board Renewal Board Renewal\n\nBoard renewal is a key focus for the Board. The NC conducts an annual review of each Director, and the composition of the Board and Board Committees. New Directors will be introduced gradually so that the Board and Board committees have a smooth transition period. Board renewal is a key focus for the Board.

Other key considerations include (i) whether the candidate would \u038b t in with our Board's culture and diversity; (ii) the independence status of the candidate; and (iii) whether the candidate would be able to commit su \u038d cient time to ful \u038b l the duties of a Director.

        "page_content": "## Induction and Training for Directors\n\nThe NC oversees the onboarding of new Directors. All new Directors go through our induction programme, which covers the duties and obligations of a Director and the responsibilities of, and work carried out by the Board committees. We provide a Director's pack, which acts as an aide memoire for the information covered by the induction programme. We have brie \u038b ng sessions for Directors given by members of senior management on the various businesses of DBS and its supporting functions. The NC is also responsible for ensuring that new Directors with no prior experience as a director of a listed company in Singapore undergo training in the roles and responsibilities of a director of a listed company. As DBS is the \u038b rst Singapore listed company directorship for our new Director, Mr David Ho, he attended training sessions conducted by the Singapore Institute of Directors (SID) on the roles and responsibilities of a listed company director. As part of the SGX-mandated sustainability training, he also attended the sustainability course, 'Environment, Social and Governance Essentials'.\n\nIn addition, Mr David Ho attended our induction programme over four days after he was appointed as a Director. As part of the induction programme, he had one-on-one meetings with members of the GMC.\n\n## Annual review of Directors' independence\n\nThe NC reviews and determines annually whether each Director is independent in accordance with the stringent standards required of \u038b nancial institutions prescribed under the Regulations. Under the Regulations, an \"independent director\" is de \u038b ned to mean a Director who is:\n\n- \u00b7 independent from any management and business relationship with DBS;\n- \u00b7 independent from any substantial shareholder of DBS; and\n- \u00b7 has not served on the Board of DBS for a continuous period of nine years or longer.\n\nThe NC assessed and concluded that (i) all Directors are considered to be independent from business relationships with DBS; (ii) with the exception of Mr Piyush Gupta, all Directors are considered to be independent from management relationships with DBS; (iii) with the exception of Mr Chng Kai Fong, all Directors are considered to be independent from DBSH's substantial shareholder, Temasek Holdings (Private) Limited (Temasek). Mr Chng, who is the Permanent Secretary (Information and Development)\n\nfor the Ministry of Communications and Information, and concurrently the Permanent Secretary (Development) (Cybersecurity) in the Prime Minister's O \u038d ce, Singapore, is considered not independent of Temasek as the Singapore government is its ultimate owner; and (iv) Mr Peter Seah is a NonIndependent Director as he has served on the Board for more than nine years. Based on the NC's assessment, the Independent Directors are Dr Bonghan Cho, Mr David Ho, Ms Punita Lal, Ms Judy Lee, Mr Olivier Lim, Mr Anthony Lim and Mr Tham Sai Choy.\n\nAlthough Mr Piyush Gupta, Mr David Ho, Ms Judy Lee, Mr Olivier Lim, Mr Anthony Lim, Mr Peter Seah and Mr Tham Sai Choy are on the boards of companies that have business relationships with DBS, and/ or are also directors of companies in which Temasek has investments (Temasek portfolio companies), the NC considers these Directors (i) independent of business relationships as the revenues arising from such relationships are not material; and (ii) independent of Temasek as their appointments on the boards of Temasek portfolio companies are nonexecutive in nature and they are not involved in the day-to-day conduct of the businesses of the Temasek portfolio companies. In addition, none of these Directors sit on any of the boards of the Temasek portfolio companies as a representative of Temasek and they do not take instructions from Temasek in acting as Directors.\n\n## Board performance and evaluation\n\nThe NC makes an assessment at least once a year to determine whether the Board and Board committees are performing e \u038a ectively and identi \u038b es steps for improvement. The NC believes that it is important to obtain an independent perspective on the Board's performance periodically, and to gain insights on the Board's performance against peer boards and best practices. An external evaluator was last engaged to conduct the Board performance evaluation for the \u038b nancial year ended 2021.\n\nIn 2023, the NC engaged Russell Reynolds Associates (RRA), an independent external evaluator, to conduct the Board Evaluation for FY2023. RRA is not connected with DBS or any of the Directors. As part of the evaluation process, RRA conducted one-on-one interviews with each Director and selected members of senior management to obtain more in-depth feedback and perspectives on the performance of the Board. Thereafter, the Board evaluation questionnaire (which included questions on, inter alia , alignment of the Board on key issues and strategy, culture, diversity, overall Board dynamics, Board performance, and Board e \u038a ectiveness)\n\nwas augmented and circulated to each Director for their completion. The NC and Board analysed the report prepared by RRA and engaged in discussions regarding the \u038b ndings and recommendations. The results of the Board evaluation exercise a \u038d rmed that the Board continues to be well-managed and e \u038a ective in ful \u038b lling its duties and responsibilities.\n\nIn addition to the annual Board evaluation exercise, the NC also conducts an annual review of each Director to determine whether each Director remains quali \u038b ed for o \u038d ce. In making its determination, the NC will take into account (i) the Director's age, track record, experience, skills and capabilities; (ii) whether each Director is able to and has been adequately carrying out his/ her duties as a Director, including the contributions and performance of each Director; and (iii) whether each Director has committed su \u038d cient time to his/ her duties as a director of DBS. The Board is satis \u038b ed that each Director has diligently discharged his or her duties as a Director of DBS and has contributed meaningfully to DBS.\n\n## Directors' time commitment\n\nThe meeting attendance records of all Directors as well as a list of their directorships of listed companies and their principal commitments are fully disclosed in the Annual Report. The NC assesses each Director's ability to commit time to DBS' a \u038a airs in accordance with internal guidelines which take into account the number of other board and committee memberships a Director holds, as well as the size and complexity of the companies in which he/ she is a board member. Additionally, each Director is required to complete an annual self-assessment of his/ her time commitments.\n\nWhile the Board has not set a maximum number of listed company board representations a Director may hold, all Directors appreciate the high level of commitment required of them. All Directors have met the requirements under the NC's guidelines. Based on the recent individual Director self-assessment for FY2023, and the attendance record of Board and Board Committee meetings during the year, the NC was satis \u038b ed that where a Director had other listed company board representations, and/ or other principal commitments, the Director was able and had been adequately carrying out his/ her duties as a director of DBS.\n\n## Directors' tenure\n\nThe NC members believe that it is in the interest of DBS for the Board to comprise both Directors with long tenure who have a deep understanding of the banking industry, as well as those with shorter tenures who can bring fresh ideas and perspectives. There are currently two Directors who have served for more than 11 years, and this is balanced by the progressive refreshing of the Board where seven long-serving Directors have stepped down and eight new Directors have been appointed since November 2017 (when we commenced the refreshing process).\n\nThe NC speci \u038b cally considered the skillsets and contributions of two long-serving Directors who will be remaining on the Board (being Mr Peter Seah and Mr Piyush Gupta). The NC deliberated and agreed that it is in DBS' interests for these Directors to continue serving on the Board of DBS for the following reasons:\n\n- (i) it is important that Mr Seah remains as the Board Chairman to provide leadership and continuity. Mr Seah is a veteran former banker with wide industry experience, and he has been instrumental in the growth and transformation of DBS over the past 14 years. His guidance will be particularly valuable as DBS navigates the current macro-economic and geopolitical challenges, executes its digital transformation, growth and sustainability strategies and strengthens its franchise in the Greater Bay Area, China, Taiwan, India and Indonesia; and\n- (ii) as CEO, Mr Gupta should remain as a Director to provide the Board with insights into the business.\n\n## Re-election of Directors\n\nUnder the Constitution of DBSH, onethird of Directors who are longest-serving since their last re-election are required to retire from o \u038d ce and, if eligible, stand for re-election at each AGM. Based on this rotation process, each Director is required to submit himself or herself for re-election by shareholders at least once every three years. In addition, new Directors (who are appointed in between AGMs) are required under DBSH's Constitution to stand for re-election at the \u038b rst AGM after their appointment. The NC reviews and recommends to the Board the rotation and re  election of Directors at the AGM.\n\nPrior to each AGM, Group Secretariat informs the NC which Directors are required to retire at that AGM. The NC will then review the composition of the Board and decide whether to recommend to the Board the\n\nre-election of these Directors, after taking into account factors such as their attendance, participation, contribution, expertise and competing time commitments.\n\nAt the 2024 AGM, Mr Piyush Gupta, Mr Chng Kai Fong and Ms Judy Lee will be retiring by rotation, while Mr David Ho is required to stand for re-election as this is the \u038b rst AGM after his appointment. At the recommendation of the NC and as approved by the Board, all four Directors will be standing for re-election at the 2024 AGM.\n\n## Review of composition of Board Committees\n\nThe NC regularly reviewed the size and composition of the Board committees in 2023 to ensure that all independence requirements continue to be met, and that the Board committees are of an appropriate size and comprise the appropriate balance of skills, knowledge and experience, as well as diversity of nationality, age and gender.\n\nIn 2023, the NC recommended, and the Board approved the following changes to the composition of the Board committees with e \u038a ect from 1 November:\n\n- \u00b7 Dr Bonghan Cho, who had previously served as a member of the SBC, was appointed as a member of the BRMC. This will allow the BRMC and BTRC to tap on Dr Bonghan Cho's skills and experience in the technology area more e \u038a ectively. Concurrently, he stepped down as a member of the AC.\n- \u00b7 Mr David Ho stepped down as a member of the BRMC, and was appointed as a member of the AC, leveraging his expertise and experience with regulated \u038b nancial institutions in Hong Kong and Canada. This ensures that the AC continues to be appropriately constituted with members equipped with the relevant skill sets.\n\n## Continuous development programme for all Directors\n\nThe NC monitors the frequency and quality of the Board training sessions, which are conducted either by external professionals or by management. The NC selects topics which are relevant to the Group's activities. Board members also contribute by highlighting areas of interests and possible topics.\n\nThe topics presented to the Board in 2023 as part of the continuous development programme included a training session on the state of generative arti \u038b cial intelligence and data governance.\n\n## Board diversity\n\nWe recognise that diversity is not merely limited to gender or any other personal attributes. We adopted a Board Diversity Policy which recognises the importance of having an e \u038a ective and diverse Board, and states that the NC is responsible for setting the relevant objectives that promote and achieve diversity on the Board. In discharging its duties, the NC shall give due regard to the bene \u038b ts of all aspects of diversity and strive to ensure that the Board is appropriately balanced to support the long-term success of DBS.\n\nThe main objective of the Board Diversity Policy is to continue to maintain the appropriate balance of perspectives, skills and experience on the Board to support the long-term success of DBS. The Board Diversity Policy provides that the NC shall endeavour to ensure that female candidates are included for consideration when identifying candidates to be appointed as new directors, with the aim of having not less than two female directors on the Board, and will target to achieve 30% female Board representation by 2030. Currently, two out of 10 directors on the Board (20% of the Board) are female.\n\nThe NC is responsible for developing a framework to identify the skills that the Board collectively needs in order to discharge the Board's responsibilities e \u038a ectively, taking into account the complexity of DBS' existing risk pro \u038b le, business operations and future business strategy. The NC has put in place a skills matrix which classi \u038b es skills, experience and knowledge of Directors into the following broad categories (i) Industry knowledge and experience; (ii) Financial and commercial acumen; (iii) Governance; (iv) Leadership; (v) Digital Transformation; and (vi) Sustainability.\n\nThe NC believes that there is an appropriate balance of industry knowledge, skills, background, experience, professional quali \u038b cations, age and gender on the Board, and is satis \u038b ed that the objectives of the Board Diversity Policy continue to be met.",

The CMDC provided oversight of the remuneration principles of the CEO, senior executives and control functions to ensure that they remained in line with the Financial Stability Board's guidelines. As part of the review process, the CMDC appraised DBS' performance against the balanced scorecard for the year, and also took into account market trends to ensure that the Group's remuneration remained competitive to the market.\n\nDBS has a robust disciplinary framework linked to individual compensation. The CMDC was apprised of the impact of disciplinary actions on individuals' compensation when approving the annual variable compensation pool and noted that (i) the Group's overall risk management are adequate and e \u038a ective, and (ii) the 2023 Risk & Culture score from the Kincentric MyVoice survey increased to 93%.

Unless otherwise determined by the Board, non-executive Directors receive 70% of their fees in cash and the remaining 30% in share awards.\n\nThe share awards are not subject to a vesting period, but are subject to a selling moratorium whereby each non-executive Director is required to hold the equivalent of one year's basic retainer fees for his or her tenure as a Director and for one year after the date he or she steps down. The fair value of share grants to the non-executive Directors are based on the volume-weighted average price of the ordinary shares of DBSH over the 10 trading days immediately prior to (and excluding)\n\nthe date of the AGM. The actual number of ordinary shares to be awarded is rounded down to the nearest share, and any residual balance is paid in cash. Other than these share awards, the non-executive Directors do not receive any other share incentives or securities under the DBSH Share Plan.\n\nIn 2023, the CMDC appointed Willis Tower Watsons (WTW), an independent external remuneration consultant, not connected with DBS or any of the Directors, to conduct a benchmarking of the Directors' remuneration against comparable local and foreign banks and companies. The benchmarking exercise concluded that the existing remuneration structure remains competitive and that no change is necessary. The CMDC had endorsed, and the Board had approved WTW's recommendations.\n\nThe table on page 58 sets out the annual fee structure for the non-executive Directors for FY2023. There is no change to the annual fee structure from FY2022. Non-executive Directors are also paid attendance fees\n\nfor attending Board and Board committee meetings.

The higher remuneration for FY2023 is mainly attributable to the following: (i) increase in BSC meetings (4 meetings compared to 2 in 2022), and (ii) transition between Mr Ho Tian Yee and Mr David Ho on the board of Directors, with Mr David Ho serving on more Board committees.

DBS adopts the Three Lines Model for risk management, where each line has clear roles and responsibilities.

In this way, appropriate levels of management are made aware of such incidents and can take action accordingly. There are also well-de \u038b ned procedures for the escalation, investigation and follow up of any reported wrong-doing by a DBS employee, customer, vendor or third party.\n\n## Second line\n\nOur second line including Risk Management Group and Group Legal and Compliance provide independent risk oversight, monitoring and reporting. They are responsible for the development and maintenance of risk management policies and processes, and they provide objective review and challenge on the activities undertaken by business and support units.\n\n## Third line\n\nGroup Audit forms the third line. It provides an independent assessment and assurance on the reliability, adequacy and e \u038a ectiveness of our system of internal controls, risk management, governance framework and processes.\n\nIn 2023, we implemented several changes to our Three Lines Model to strengthen technology risk governance:\n\n- (i) To bolster our \u038b rst line's ability to identify and manage risk, we established a new Quality Assurance Function within Enterprise Architecture Site Reliability Engineering. This function adds an additional layer of independent veri \u038b cation, controls, and checks over the Bank's change management process;\n- (ii) For more objective review and e \u038a ective challenge, we moved a dedicated Technology Risk Management team, with new leadership and expanded expertise, into the second line (within the Risk Management Group); and\n- (iii) In order to ensure a robust third line, we increased the resources allocated to the audit of information technology. This allows our third line to continue to provide an independent assessment and assurance on the reliability, adequacy, and e \u038a ectiveness of  technology risk management governance, controls and processes.\n\n| Board, CEO and    | Provides oversight of the three lines model                 | Provides oversight of the three lines model                   | Provides oversight of the three lines model   |\n|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|\n| Senior Management | First line                                                  | Second line                                                   | Third line                                    |\n| Role              | Own and manage risks in respective  areas of responsibility | Provide independent risk oversight,  monitoring and reporting | Provide independent assurance                 |\n| Unit              | Business and support units                                  | Risk Management Group, Group  Legal and Compliance            | Group Audit                                   |\n\n## Group Audit\n\n## Key responsibilities and processes\n\nGroup Audit is independent of the activities it audits. Its objectives, scope of authority and responsibilities are de \u038b ned in the Audit Charter, which is approved by the AC. Group Audit reports functionally to the Chairperson of the AC and administratively to the CEO. Group Audit's responsibilities include:\n\n- \u00b7 evaluating the reliability, adequacy and e \u038a ectiveness of the Group's system of internal controls, risk management, governance framework and processes;\n- \u00b7 providing an objective and independent assessment of the Group's credit portfolio quality, the execution of approved credit portfolio strategies and control standards relating to credit management processes;\n- \u00b7 reviewing whether DBS complies with laws and regulations and adheres to established policies; and\n- \u00b7 reviewing whether management is taking appropriate steps to address control de \u038b ciencies.\n\nGroup Audit adheres to the DBS Code of Conduct and is guided by the Mission Statement in the Audit Charter. It adopted the Code of Ethics and aligned its practices with the International Professional Practices Framework established by the Institute of Internal Auditors (IIA). In addition, it has embedded IIA's 10 Core Principles for the Professional Practice of Internal Auditing into its activities.\n\nGroup Audit has unfettered access to the AC, the Board and management, as well as the right to seek information and explanation. The Head of Group Audit has a seat in the GMC and attends all the business reviews and strategic planning forums. The respective heads of audit in each of the \u038b ve key locations outside Singapore are part of that location's management team.\n\nGroup Audit adopts a risk-based approach in its auditing activities. An annual audit plan is developed using a structured risk and control assessment framework through which the inherent risk and control e \u038a ectiveness of each auditable entity in the Group is assessed. This risk assessment methodology and approach are aligned with that of the Group, including the risk taxonomy.\n\nThe assessment also covers risks arising from new lines of business, new products and emerging risks from DBS' operating environment. Audit projects are planned based on the results of the assessment, with priority given to auditing higher risk areas and as required by regulators.\n\nAudit reports containing identi \u038b ed issues and corrective action plans are reported to the AC and senior management. Progress of the corrective action plans is monitored, and past due action plans are included in regular reports to the senior management and the AC. In all routine audits, Group Audit evaluates the control environment and management's control\n\nawareness which incorporates risk culture as guided by the Financial Stability Board's Guidance on Sound Risk Culture.\n\nGroup Audit apprises regulators and external auditors of all relevant audit matters. It works closely with external auditors to coordinate audit e \u038a orts.\n\n## Quality assurance and key developments\n\nIn line with leading practices, Group Audit has a quality assurance and improvement programme (QAIP) that covers its audit activity and conforms to the International Standards for the Professional Practice of Internal Auditing. As part of the QAIP, internal quality assurance reviews (QAR) are conducted quarterly, and external QAR are carried out at least once every \u038b ve years by quali \u038b ed professionals from an external organisation. In 2023, Ernst and Young (EY) was appointed to conduct the external QAR. Based on EY's assessment, Group Audit leads the industry in the use of data analytics and digital tools in its audit activities such as risk assessment, \u038b eldwork and reporting. In EY's maturity model assessment, Group Audit was also rated the highest level for Purpose, People, Risk assessment and Planning; Reporting, Enablement and Innovation; and Impact, In \u038c uence and Involvement.\n\nIn 2023, Group Audit advanced the digitalisation of its documentation process using its workbench. The new process was piloted regionally and with some enhancements, a full roll out will be implemented in due course. b In 2023, Group Audit also took on the additional task as Secretariat to the Special Board Committee (SBC), and supported the evaluation and appointment of an independent reviewer as well as its regular meetings to oversee the implementation of recti \u038b cation measures pursuant to MAS directives on the digital disruptions. b\n\nTo strengthen and uplift industry-wide auditing (internal & external) of AML/ CFT Risk, the AML Audit Peer Group (AAPG), co-chaired by DBS/ OCBC was formed and made good progress under the guidance of MAS, to gather insights from Internal and External Audit \u038b rms with the objective of setting a set of baseline standards and best practices for adoption.\n\n## Rule 720(1) Undertaking\n\nIn compliance with Rule 720(1) of the Listing Manual, we have procured undertakings from all of our Directors and executive o \u038d cers to use their best endeavours to (a) comply with the relevant provisions of the Listing Manual; and (b) procure that DBS complies with the relevant provisions of the Listing Manual.\n\n## Dealings in securities\n\nAlthough the Group has transitioned to a semi-annual reporting regime, the trading updates that are provided for the \u038b rst and third quarters of each \u038b nancial year are, for the purpose of the 'black-out' policies prescribed under Rule 1207(19) of the SGX Listing Rules, deemed to constitute ' \u038b nancial statements'. Accordingly, Directors and employees are prohibited from trading in DBS' securities (i) one month before the release of the full-year \u038b nancial statements; and (ii) two weeks before the release of its quarterly \u038b nancial statements for the \u038b rst, second and third quarters of each \u038b nancial year.\n\nIn addition, business units and subsidiaries engaging in proprietary trading are restricted from trading in DBS' securities during the black-out period. Group Secretariat informs all Directors and employees of each black-out period ahead of time. Directors and employees are prohibited at all times from trading in DBS' securities if they are in possession of material non-public information.\n\nGMC members are only allowed to trade in DBS' securities within speci \u038b c window periods (15 market days immediately following the expiry of each black-out period) subject to pre -clearance. GMC members are also required to obtain pre-approval from the CEO\n\nbefore any sale of DBS' securities. Similarly, the CEO is required to seek pre-approval from the Chairman before any sale of DBS' securities. As part of our commitment to good governance and the principles of share ownership by senior management, the CEO is expected to build up and hold at least the equivalent of three times his annual base salary as DBSH shares over time.\n\nDBS has put in place a personal investment policy which prohibits employees from trading in securities in which they possess pricesensitive information in the course of their duties. Such employees are also required to seek pre clearance before making any personal trades in securities, and may only trade through the Group's stockbroking subsidiaries and bank channels for securities listed in Singapore and Hong Kong. The personal investment policy discourages employees from engaging in short-term speculative trading.\n\n## Related Party Transactions and Interested Person Transactions\n\nDBS has embedded procedures to comply with regulations governing related party transactions and interested party transactions.\n\nFor related party transactions, we are required to comply with regulations prescribed by the MAS which set out the de \u038b nition, scope and general principles governing such transactions, along with the responsibilities of banks to maintain oversight and control so as to mitigate the risk of abuse arising from con \u038c icts of interest.\n\nWe have established a Board-approved framework to give e \u038a ect to these regulatory requirements. This, along with material related party transactions, is reviewed by the Board regularly.\n\nAll new Directors are briefed on relevant provisions that a \u038a ect them. If necessary, existing credit facilities to related parties are adjusted prior to a Director's appointment, and all credit facilities to related parties are continually monitored.\n\nWith respect to interested party transactions, we have established processes to comply with the requirements outlined in Chapter 9 of the SGXST Listing Manual. The aggregate contract values of DBS' interested person transactions entered into in 2023 are set out in the table on page 62.\n\nDBS enters into various interested person transactions with Temasek and its associates on arm's length commercial terms and for the purpose of carrying out day-to-day operations (such as leasing of premises, telecommunication/ data services, IT systems\n\nand related services, redemption of air miles by DBS/ POSB credit card holders, logistics and security services).\n\nIn FY2023, our contracts with Temasek Holdings (Private) Limited Group amounted to an aggregated SGD 27.4 million. This accounted for less than 0.05% of DBS' audited net tangible assets.\n\n## Material contracts\n\nSave for the transactions disclosed in the table on page 62 and via SGXNET, there were no material contracts involving the interest of any Director or controlling shareholder of DBS entered into by DBS or any of its subsidiary companies, which are either still subsisting at the end of the \u038b nancial year, or if not then subsisting, entered into since the end of the previous \u038b nancial year.\n\n## Assessing the e \u038a ectiveness of internal controls\n\nDBS has a risk management process that requires all units to perform a half-yearly risk and control self-assessment (RCSA) to assess the e \u038a ectiveness of their internal controls. In addition, all units of the Group are required to submit quarterly attestations on their controls relating to the \u038b nancial reporting process, and annual attestations on their compliance with the overall internal controls framework. Based on the RCSA and the quarterly and annual attestations, the CEO and the key management personnel responsible for risk management and internal control systems provide an annual attestation to the AC relating to the adequacy and e \u038a ectiveness of DBS' risk management and internal control systems.\n\nGroup Audit performs regular independent reviews to provide assurance on the adequacy and e \u038a ectiveness of DBS' internal controls on risk management, control and governance processes. The overall adequacy and e \u038a ectiveness of DBS' internal controls framework is reviewed by the AC and BRMC.",

However, but without limiting the foregoing, management has highlighted that, arising from the review of the digital disruptions in 2023, four main areas with respect to information technology risk management and controls, namely, change management, system resiliency, incident management, and technology governance and oversight, will have to be further strengthened.\n\nIn this regard, the Board noted that management had drawn up a comprehensive technology resiliency roadmap to address the gaps that had been identi \u038b ed. In particular:\n\n- (i) Change management: Change management controls are being tightened and a near-production environment will be created to allow for more robust testing before going live with new changes or release.\n- (ii) Enhancing system resiliency: To ensure that key services have minimal downtime, potential failure scenarios and possible remediation actions are identi \u038b ed. Some of these actions, such as having a warm standby or increased redundancy, have been implemented. Other system changes, which are more structural in nature, are work-in-progress.\n- (iii) Incident management: In the last year, having built comprehensive diagnostic capabilities, real-time monitoring data and alerts are now being leveraged as part of the incident management process.\n- (iv) Technology risk governance: To strengthen technology risk governance and oversight, a new sub-committee of the Board Risk Management Committee called the BRMC Technology Risk Committee has been established. To enhance independent checks and balances, the Technology Risk Management team was transferred to the Risk Management Group.\n\nFor further details on the various technology resiliency improvements (including those being progressively implemented), please refer to the Letter from the Chairman and CEO under 'Enhancing our technology resilience' on page 10, the CIO Statement under 'Driving the resiliency and reliability of our technology' on pages 34 and 35 and the CRO Statement under 'Rebuilding Customer Trust with Enhanced Technology Resilience' on pages 32 to 33.\n\nBased on the internal controls established and maintained by the Group, work performed by internal and external auditors, reviews performed by management and\n\nvarious Board committees, as well as assurances received from and mitigation and remedial actions undertaken by management in relation to the identi \u038b ed gaps, the Board, with the concurrence of the AC, is of the opinion that the Group's internal controls and risk management systems were adequate and e \u038a ective as at 31 December 2023 to address \u038b nancial, operational, compliance and information technology risks which the Group considers relevant and material to its operations.\n\nThe Board notes that the internal controls and risk management systems provide reasonable, but not absolute, assurance that the Group will not be a \u038a ected by any event that could be reasonably foreseen as it strives to achieve its business objectives. In this regard, the Board also notes that no system can provide absolute assurance against the occurrence of material errors, poor judgement in decision-making, human error, fraud or other irregularities.\n\n## Strong culture\n\n## E \u038a ective safeguards\n\nWe believe that e \u038a ective safeguards against undesired business conduct have to go beyond a \"tick-the-box\" mentality. In DBS, other than relying on published codes of conduct, we also advocate the following organisational safeguards to maintain a strong risk and governance culture.\n\n- \u00b7 Tone from the top: The tone set by the Board and senior management is vital; it is equivalent to the moral compass of the organisation. In addition to having in place comprehensive policies, we conduct a robust self-assessment on the Group's risk culture. Please refer to the risk culture section on this page for more information.\n- \u00b7 Aligning strategies and incentives via the balanced scorecard: Please refer to the section on \"Our 2023 priorities\" on pages 26 to 31 for more information.\n- \u00b7 Respecting the voice of control functions: We believe that respect for the voice of control functions is a key safeguard. We ensure that control functions are well integrated into our organisational structure so that they can properly discharge their responsibilities.\n- \u00b7 Risk ownership: Please refer to page 59 to 60 for details on our Three Lines Model.\n- \u00b7 Established escalation protocols: We established a noti \u038b cation protocol that makes it mandatory for sta \u038a to report signi \u038b cant incidents, demonstrating our organisational readiness to receive unfavourable information, and undertake prompt remedial actions without any adverse consequences for those reporting the incidents.\n- \u00b7 Encouraging constructive challenges at all levels: Fundamentally, we inculcate a culture that encourages constructive challenges and debate, where all views are evaluated for decision-making. We also operate a culture where we actively engage the Board for their views early.\n- \u00b7 Reinforcing cultural alignment: Finally, we conscientiously reinforce our cultural norms by rewarding right behaviours and censuring wrong ones.\n\n## Risk Culture\n\nRisk culture is closely intertwined with our corporate values, and it encompasses the general awareness, attitudes and behaviour of our employees towards risks. The results of our Risk Culture and Conduct Survey conducted in 2023 indicated a satisfactory risk culture bank-wide.\n\nIn 2023, we continued to monitor our risk culture pulse with a risk culture and conduct dashboard, comprising multi-faceted indicators. Creating awareness remained a key focus as we continue to reinforce a strong culture of risk and control across all levels within the organisation. We leveraged digital communication channels to share culture related content and conducted training with case studies to aid managers in strengthening the \"Tone from the Middle\" and to enhance employee risk sensing and judgement. We continue to place emphasis on conduct as part of our compensation evaluation process.\n\n## The DBS Code of Conduct (Code of Conduct)\n\nThe Code of Conduct sets out the principles and standards of behaviour that are expected of employees of the Group (including part-time and temporary employees) when dealing with customers, business associates, regulators and colleagues. The principles covered in the Code of Conduct include professional integrity, con \u038b dentiality, con \u038c icts of interests, fair dealings with customers and whistle-blowing. It also de \u038b nes the procedures for employees of DBS to report incidents and provides protection for those sta \u038a for these disclosures.\n\nAll employees of DBS are required to read and acknowledge the Code of Conduct on an annual basis. Members of the public may access the Code of Conduct on DBS' website at the following URL: https:// go.dbs.com/CodeOfConduct. The Code of Conduct encourages employees of DBS to report their concerns to DBS' dedicated, independent investigation team within Group Compliance which handles whistle-blowing cases according to a well-de \u038b ned protocol. Alternatively, in case of actual or potential con \u038c ict of interest or fear of retribution, employees of DBS may write in con \u038b dence to Human Resources, Group Audit, or even the\n\nCEO or the Chairman. In addition, employees of DBS have the option of using the DBS Speak Up service.\n\n## Whistle-blowing policy\n\nDBS Speak Up is a hotline service run by an independent external party that gives employees of the Group the opportunity to speak up on misconduct and/ or wrong-doing by a DBS employee, customer, vendor or third party.\n\nDBS Speak Up service includes:\n\n- \u00b7 a dedicated hotline number, website, email address, fax number and postal address for reporting of suspected incidents of misconduct and wrongdoing;\n- \u00b7 specialist call centre operators with knowledge of individual organisations;\n- \u00b7 expert forensic investigators to analyse reports;\n- \u00b7 timely reporting of incidents to dedicated representatives within an organisation; and\n- \u00b7 recommendations on corrective action.\n\n## Accountability to our shareholders\n\n## Shareholder rights\n\nDBS promotes fair and equitable treatment of all shareholders. All shareholders enjoy speci \u038b c rights under the Singapore Companies Act and DBSH's Constitution. These rights include, among others, the right to participate in pro \u038b t distributions and the right to attend and vote at general meetings. Ordinary shareholders are entitled to attend and vote at general meetings in person or by proxy. Indirect investors who hold DBSH shares through a nominee company or custodian bank or through a CPF agent bank (\"Relevant Intermediaries\") may attend and vote at general meetings by requesting their Relevant Intermediaries to appoint them as proxies.\n\nDBS respects the equal information rights of all shareholders and is committed to the practice of fair, transparent and timely disclosure. All price-sensitive information is publicly released prior to any sessions with individual investors or analysts.\n\nThe Board provides shareholders with regular \u038b nancial reports, which aim to give shareholders a balanced assessment of the Group's \u038b nancial performance and position. The Board also ensures timely and full disclosure of material corporate developments to shareholders.",

Our remuneration framework is designed to be consistent with market best practices, drive business strategy and create long-term shareholder value. Remuneration policies and practices as set out in the following report are governed by a set of sound principles which are in compliance with various regulatory requirements.\n\n## 1 Objectives of DBS remuneration strategy\n\nDBS' remuneration policy, which is applicable to DBS Bank and all our subsidiaries and overseas of \u038b ces, seeks to ensure that we are able to attract, motivate and retain employees to deliver long-term shareholder returns, taking into consideration risk management principles and standards set out by the Financial Stability Board (FSB) and the Code of Corporate Governance.\n\nAt DBS, remuneration is determined based on the Group's performance, which is evaluated against a balanced scorecard. The scorecard is detailed and comprises speci \u038b c key performance indicators (KPIs), including how we fare against shareholder, customer and employee indicators; as well as a range of focus areas such as progress in transforming the bank, scaling growth across our markets, managing risks etc. DBS PRIDE!* values are also taken into account in order to drive desired behaviours.\n\nThe following shows the three main thrusts of our remuneration strategy and how they are implemented within DBS:\n\n| Main thrusts                                                | Details                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Pay for performance as measured  against balanced scorecard | \u00b7  Instill and drive a pay-for-performance culture \u00b7  Ensure close linkage between total compensation and our annual and long-term  business objectives as measured by our balanced scorecard \u00b7  Calibrate mix of  \u038b xed and variable pay to drive sustainable performance that is aligned to |\n| Provide market competitive pay                              | \u00b7  Benchmark our total compensation against other organisations of similar size and  standing in the markets we operate in                                                                                                                                                                    |\n| Guard against excessive risk-taking                         | \u00b7  Focus on achieving risk-adjusted returns that are consistent with prudent risk and  capital management, as well as emphasise long-term sustainable outcomes                                                                                                                                |\n|                                                             | \u00b7  Design payout structure to align incentive payments with the long-term performance of  the Group through deferral and clawback arrangements                                                                                                                                                |\n\nRead more about the balanced scorecard in Our 2023 priorities on page 26.\n\n* Read more on our PRIDE! values on page 71.",

The variable pay pool is derived from a combination of a bottom-up and top-down approach. Annually, Management does a self-evaluation on the Group's performance against the balanced scorecard.  This is presented to the Compensation and Management Development Committee (CMDC) who assesses the performance, based on which it approves the variable pay pool, which is subsequently endorsed by the Board of Directors (Board).\n\n| Process                             | Details                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Determining total variable pay pool | \u00b7  A function of our overall performance against the balanced scorecard and benchmarked  against market. The scorecard includes substantial risk and control metrics designed and  evaluated by the control functions such as Audit, Compliance and Risk. Control functions  therefore have a direct role in determining the size of the variable pay pool. The variable pay pool is further calibrated against the following prisms: |\n| Allocating pool to business units   | \u00b7  Pool allocation takes into account the relative performance of each unit against their  balanced scorecard as evaluated by the CEO \u00b7  Inputs from control functions are sought                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n| Determining individual award        | \u00b7  Unit heads cascade their allocated pool to their teams and individuals \u00b7  Individual variable pay determined based on performance against goals and DBS PRIDE!

The remuneration of the Chief Risk Of \u038b cer (CRO) and Group Head of Audit are endorsed by the Chairman of Board Risk Management Committee and Audit Committee respectively and subsequently approved by the Board.\n\nSales employees are incentivised to promote the development of mutually bene \u038b cial long-term relationships with their customers, rather than a sole focus on short-term gains.

Their variable remuneration is subject to deferral, thus ensuring alignment to the time horizon of risks.\n\nThe following charts show the mix of \u038b xed and variable pay for both groups for performance year 2023:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Fixed pay\n- Variable pay-cash and/ or shares\n- Variable pay-deferred shares and/ or deferred cash (including retention awards)\n\n## Note:\n\nWe do not provide any other forms of \u0234 xed and variable remuneration aside from those disclosed in this section\n\nOur Senior Management's aggregate total compensation (salary, cash bonus and deferred awards), excluding that of the CEO which is separately disclosed, amounted to SGD 63.5 million in 2023, a reduction from SGD 73.8 million in 2022. The total variable pay for Senior Management including CEO was reduced by 21% re \u038c ecting Senior Management's accountability for the digital disruptions.\n\nWhile corporate governance guidelines recommend that at least the top \u038b ve key executives' remuneration be disclosed, the Board believes that it would be disadvantageous for us to do so because of the constant battle for talent in a highly competitive industry. This is consistent with banking industry practice in the local market. However, we do provide additional information on the total compensation of our Senior Management in the year as detailed above.",

Net pro \u038b t of SGD 10.3 billion and return on equity of 18.0% were at new highs. The bank's solid \u038b nancial performance was not just a re \u038c ection of the macroeconomic environment, but also a result of the structural shifts made in the last decade to digitalise the bank and grow new lines of business.\n\nDBS continued to cement its presence in Asia. Following the integration of Lakshmi Vilas Bank, the bank's India platform is now the most complete outside of Singapore. In Taiwan, the bank successfully integrated Citigroup Inc.'s consumer banking business in August 2023, and is now the largest foreign bank by assets.\n\nDBS' focus on Managing through Journeys matured during the year. The use of arti \u038b cial intelligence/ machine learning (AI/ ML) also continued to gain traction. The bank has deployed over 350 use cases, and more than doubled the economic value from AI/ ML to SGD 370 million.\n\nEmployee engagement as measured by Kincentric's MyVoice scores reached a record 90%.\n\nOn the sustainability front, DBS accelerated its climate agenda through enhanced client engagement on transition planning, \u038b nancing and ecosystem partnerships. To improve the lives of the underprivileged, the bank pledged to give up to SGD 1 billion over the next 10 years to suitable causes.\n\nIn 2023, DBS was recognised by Global Finance as one of the top \u038b ve World's Most Innovative Banks. Euromoney named DBS the World's Best Bank for Corporate Responsibility. DBS was also named as Safest Bank in Asia by Global Finance for the 15th consecutive year.\n\nWhile the bank fared well against most priorities on its balanced scorecard, it fell short in technology resiliency. This, and the resultant impact on customers and the franchise, were taken into account when determining the scorecard performance of both the Group and the CEO. Despite record 2023 pro \u038b ts and outperformance in many areas, the gaps in technology resiliency resulted in a lower scorecard appraisal by the Board compared to the previous year.\n\nGiven the scorecard performance, as well as the Board's determination that the CEO and other Group Management Committee members' variable pay should be cut to hold them accountable for the digital disruptions, Mr Gupta's present-year remuneration is as outlined below:\n\n## Breakdown of remuneration for performance year 2023 (1 January - 31 December)\n\n|                 | Salary SGD   | Cash bonus (1)  SGD   | Deferred Award (2) SGD   | Others (3) SGD   | Total (4) SGD   |\n|-----------------|--------------|-----------------------|--------------------------|------------------|-----------------|\n| Mr Piyush Gupta | 1,500,000    | 4,109,000             | 5,551,000                | 72,992           | 11,232,992      |\n\n- (1) The amount has been accrued in 2023 \u0234 nancial statements\n- (2) Of the deferred award, about 17.4% will be in cash, while the remaining will be in the form of shares.\n\n- (3) Represents non-cash component and comprises club, car and driver\n- (4) Refers to performance remuneration for 2023 - includes \u0234 xed pay in 2023, cash bonus received in 2024 and DBSH ordinary shares granted in 2024",

Almost onequarter of the total weighting is focused on control and compliance metrics. We have key performance indicators (KPIs) to track progress made on our transformation agenda and our shift toward managing through journeys.\n- \u00b7 Across multiple stakeholders\n- \u00b7 Between current year targets and long-term strategic outcomes\n\nThe scorecard is updated yearly and approved by the Board before being cascaded throughout the organisation, ensuring that the goals of every business, country and support function are aligned to those of the Group.\n\nPerformance is assessed against the scorecard to determine remuneration, providing a clear line of sight between employee goals and organisational imperatives.

This in \u038c uences our ability to establish new relationships or services, service existing relationships and have continued access to sources of funding. Reputational risk usually occurs when the other risks are poorly managed.\n\nRead more about this on page 96.\n\n## 3 Risk governance\n\nThe Board oversees DBS' a \u038a airs and provides sound leadership for the CEO and management. Authorised by the Board, various Board committees oversee speci \u038b c responsibilities based on clearly de \u038b ned terms of reference.\n\nUnder our risk management approach, the Board, through the Board Risk Management Committee (BRMC), sets our Risk Appetite, oversees the establishment of enterprise-wide risk management policies and processes, and establishes risk appetite limits to guide DBS' risk-taking.\n\nThe BRMC also oversees the identi \u038b cation, monitoring, management and reporting of credit, market, liquidity, operational, technology and reputational risks. In addition, the BRMC Technology Risk Committee (BTRC), a sub-committee to the BRMC, has been set up to assist the BRMC in overseeing the management of technology risk across the Group. This includes providing guidance on the implementation of the plans to uplift DBS Bank's technology resilience and the business continuity management.\n\nTo facilitate the BRMC's risk oversight, the following risk management committees have been established.\n\n## Risk management committees\n\nRisk Executive Committee (Risk EXCO)\n\nAs the overall executive body regarding risk matters, the Risk EXCO oversees DBS' risk management.\n\nGroup Credit Risk Committee (GCRC)\n\nGroup Credit Risk Models Committee (GCRMC)\n\nGroup Market and Liquidity Risk Committee (GMLRC)\n\nGroup Operational Risk Committee (GORC)\n\nGroup Technology Risk Committee (GTRC)\n\nGroup Scenario and Stress Testing Committee (GSSTC)\n\nEach of the committees reports to the Risk EXCO, and serves as an executive forum to discuss and implement DBS' risk management. Key responsibilities:\n\n- \u2022 Assess and approve risk-taking activities\n- \u2022 Oversee DBS' risk management infrastructure, which includes frameworks, decision criteria, authorities, people, policies, standards, processes, information and systems\n- \u2022 Approve risk policies such as model governance standards, stress testing scenarios, and the evaluation and endorsement of risk models\n- \u2022 Assess and monitor speci \u038b c credit concentration\n- \u2022 Recommend stress-testing scenarios (including macroeconomic variable projections) and review the results\n\nThe members in these committees comprise representatives from the Risk Management Group (RMG) as well as key business and support units.\n\nProduct Approval Committee (PAC)\n\nThe PAC provides group-wide oversight and direction for the approval of new product/ service and outsourcing initiatives. It evaluates new product/ service and outsourcing initiatives to ensure that they are in line with DBS' strategy and risk appetite.\n\nMost of the above committees are supported by local risk committees in all major locations, where appropriate. These local risk committees oversee the local risk positions for all businesses and support units, ensuring that they keep within limits set by the Group risk committees. They also approve location-speci \u038b c risk policies.\n\nThe Chief Risk O \u038d cer (CRO), who is a member of the Group Executive Committee and reports to the Chairman of the BRMC and the CEO, oversees the risk management function. The CRO is independent of business lines and is actively involved in key decision-making processes. He often engages with regulators to discuss risk matters, enabling a more holistic risk management perspective.\n\nWorking closely with the risk and business committees, the CRO is responsible for the following:\n\n- \u00b7 Management of DBS' risks, including systems and processes to identify, approve, measure, monitor, control and report risks\n- \u00b7 Engagement with senior management about material matters regarding all risk types\n- \u00b7 Development of risk controls and mitigation processes\n- \u00b7 Ensuring DBS' risk management is e \u038a ective, and the Risk Appetite established by the Board is adhered to\n\n## 4 Risk appetite\n\nDBS' Risk Appetite is set by the Board and governed by the Risk Appetite Policy, which articulates the risks that we are willing to accept. It also serves to reinforce our risk culture by setting a clear message from the 'tone from the top'. A strong organisational risk culture, complemented with a balanced incentive framework (refer to 'Remuneration Report' section on page 65), helps to further embed our Risk Appetite.\n\n## 4.1 Risk thresholds and economic capital usage\n\nOur Risk Appetite takes into account a spectrum of risk types and is implemented using thresholds, policies, processes and controls.\n\nSetting thresholds is essential in making DBS' Risk Appetite an intrinsic part of our businesses as they help to keep all our risks within acceptable levels. Portfolio risk limits for the quanti \u038b able risk types are established top down, and these are implemented using frameworks. As for the nonquanti \u038b able risk types, these are managed using qualitative principles.",

        "page_content": "To ensure that the thresholds pertaining to our Risk Appetite are completely risk sensitive, we adopted both economic capital (EC) and regulatory capital (RC) as our risk metrics. Additionally, both EC and RC are assessed as part of our Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP).\n\nOur capital allocation structure monitors credit, market and operational risks (including technology risk), by assessing regulatory capital utilisation at the business unit level. The diagram below shows how they are managed along the various dimensions. A bu \u038a er is also maintained for other risks, such as country, reputational, model risks, etc.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOther quantitative or qualitative controls are used to manage the other risks at granular levels. The following chart provides a broad overview of how our Risk Appetite permeates throughout DBS.\n\nRefer to Sections 5 through 9 for more information about each risk type.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 4.2 Stress testing\n\nStress testing is an integral part of our risk management process. It includes both sensitivity and scenario analyses, and is conducted regularly. In particular, the ICAAP (a group-wide exercise spanning di \u038a erent risk types) is performed annually. In addition, stress tests are carried out in response to microeconomic and macroeconomic conditions, or portfolio developments. Every stress test is documented and the results are reviewed by senior management and/ or the BRMC.\n\nStress testing alerts senior management to our potential vulnerability to exceptional\n\nbut plausible adverse events. As such, stress testing enables us to assess capital adequacy and identify potentially risky portfolio segments as well as inherent systematic risks. This then allows us to develop the right contingency plans, exit strategies and mitigating actions beforehand.\n\nThe ICAAP ensures our business plans are consistent with our Risk Appetite. This is done by comparing the projected demand for capital to the projected supply of capital under various scenarios, including severe macroeconomic stress.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 5 Credit risk\n\nThe most signi \u038b cant measurable risk DBS faces - credit risk - arises from our daily activities in our various businesses. These activities include lending to retail, corporate and institutional customers. It includes the risk of lending, as well as the pre-settlement and settlement risk of foreign exchange, derivatives and securities.\n\nRefer to Note 42.1 to the \u0234 nancial statements on page 169 for details on DBS' maximum exposure to credit risk.\n\n## 5.1 Credit risk management at DBS\n\nDBS' approach to credit risk management comprises the following building blocks:\n\n## Policies\n\n## Risk methodologies\n\nProcesses, systems and reports\n\n## Policies\n\nThe dimensions of credit risk and the scope of its application are de \u038b ned in the Group Credit Risk Management Policy. Senior management sets the overall direction and policy for managing credit risk at the enterprise level.\n\nThe Group Core Credit Risk Policies (CCRPs) established for Consumer Banking/ Wealth Management and Institutional Banking set forth the principles by which DBS conducts its credit risk management and control activities. These policies, supplemented by a number of operational standards and guides, ensure consistency in identifying, assessing, underwriting, measuring, reporting and controlling credit risk across DBS, and provide guidance in the formulation of businessspeci \u038b c and/ or location-speci \u038b c credit risk policies and standards.\n\nThe operational standards and guides are established to provide greater details on the implementation of the credit principles within the Group CCRPs and are adapted to re \u038c ect di \u038a erent credit environments and portfolio risk pro \u038b les. The CCRPs are approved by the Group Chief Credit O \u038d cer.\n\n## Risk methodologies\n\nCredit risk is managed by thoroughly understanding our wholesale customers the businesses they are in, as well as the economies in which they operate. It is also managed through statistical models and data analytics for retail customers.\n\nThe assignment of credit risk ratings and setting of lending limits are integral parts of DBS' credit risk management process, and we use an array of rating models for our wholesale and retail portfolios. Most of these models are built internally using DBS' loss data, and the limits are driven by DBS' Risk Appetite Statement and the Target Market and Risk Acceptance Criteria (TM-RAC).\n\nWholesale borrowers are assessed individually, and further reviewed and evaluated by experienced credit risk managers who consider relevant credit risk factors in the \u038b nal determination of the borrower's risk. For some portfolios within the SME segment, DBS also\n\nuses a programme-based approach to achieve a balanced management of risks and rewards. Retail exposures are assessed using credit score models, credit bureau records as well as internally and externally available customer behaviour records supplemented by our Risk Acceptance Criteria (RAC). Credit applications are proposed by the business units, and applications outside the RAC are independently assessed by the credit risk managers.\n\n## Refer to Section 5.3 on page 86 to read more about our internal credit risk models.\n\nPre-settlement credit risk for traded products arising from a counterparty potentially defaulting on its obligations is quanti \u038b ed by evaluation of the mark-to-market value, plus potential future exposure. This is included within DBS' overall credit limits to counterparties for internal risk management.\n\nWe actively monitor and manage our exposure to counterparties for over-thecounter (OTC) derivative trades to protect our balance sheet in the event of a counterparty default. Counterparty risk exposures that may be adversely a \u038a ected by market risk events are identi \u038b ed, reviewed and acted upon by management, and highlighted to the appropriate risk committees. Speci \u038b c wrong-way risk arises when the credit exposure of a counterparty (from the traded product transaction) directly correlates with the probability of default of the counterparty. DBS has processes in place to guide the handling of speci \u038b c wrong-way risk transactions, and its risk measurement metric takes into account the higher risks associated with such transactions.\n\nIssuer default risk that may also arise from derivatives, notes and securities is generally measured based on jump-to-default computations.\n\n## Concentration risk management\n\nFor credit risk concentration, we use EC as our measurement tool as it combines the individual risk factors such as the probability of default (PD), loss given default (LGD) and exposure at default (EAD), in addition to industry correlation and portfolio concentration. EC thresholds are set to ensure that the allocated EC stays within our Risk Appetite. Concentration risk for retail is managed at two levels - product level where exposure limits are set up, and segment level to manage the growth of high-risk segments. Governance processes are in place to ensure that these thresholds are monitored regularly, and appropriate actions are taken when the thresholds are breached.\n\nDBS continually examines and reviews how we can enhance the scope of our thresholds and approaches to manage concentration risk.\n\n## Environmental, social and governance risks\n\nDBS considers ESG risk management as critical to ensure a sustainable lending and investment portfolio. Following the establishment of the Board Sustainability Committee and incorporation of environmental risk considerations into our Risk Appetite statement in 2022, we further enhanced our Group Responsible Financing Standard which provides our overarching approach to responsible \u038b nancing and enhanced assessment required when \u038b nancing transactions with elevated ESG risks. The requirements of this document represent the minimum standards for DBS, and we have also sought alignment, where possible, with international standards and best practices. Where signi \u038b cant ESG issues are identi \u038b ed, escalation is required to IBG Sustainability and Risk Management ESG teams for further guidance prior to approval by the Credit Approving Authority.\n\nRead more about 'Responsible Financing' in the Sustainability Report.\n\n## Country risk\n\nCountry risk refers to the risk of loss due to events in a speci \u038b c country (or a group of countries). This includes political, exchange rate, economic, sovereign and transfer risks.\n\nDBS manages country risk through the requirements of the Group CCRP and the said risk is part of our concentration risk management. The way we manage transfer risk at DBS is set out in our Country Risk Management Standard. This includes an internal transfer risk and sovereign risk rating system, where assessments are made independently of business decisions. Our transfer risk limits are set in accordance with the Group Risk Appetite Policy.\n\nTransfer risk limits for individually reviewed countries are set based on country-speci \u038b c strategic business considerations as well as the acceptable potential loss according to our Risk Appetite. Management actively evaluates and determines the appropriate level of transfer risk exposures for these countries taking into account the risks and rewards and whether they are in line with our strategic intent. Limits for all other countries are set using a model-based approach.\n\nRisk Appetite for each country is approved by the BRMC, while transfer risk limits are approved by the Board EXCO and senior management.",

        "page_content": "## Credit stress testing\n\nDBS engages in various types of credit stress testing, and these are driven either by regulators or internal requirements and management. Our credit stress tests are performed at the total portfolio or\n\nPillar 1 cyclicality stress testing\n\nPillar 2 credit stress testing\n\nIndustry-wide stress testing\n\nSensitivity and scenario analyses\n\n## Processes, systems and reports\n\nDBS constantly invests in systems to support risk monitoring and reporting for our Institutional Banking and Consumer Banking/ Wealth Management businesses.\n\nThe end-to-end credit process is continually being reviewed and improved through various front-to-back initiatives involving business, operations, risk management and other key stakeholders. Day-to-day monitoring of credit exposures, portfolio performance and external environmental factors potentially a \u038a ecting credit risk pro \u038b les is key to our philosophy of e \u038a ective credit risk management.\n\nIn addition, credit trends, which may include industry analysis, early warning alerts and signi \u038b cant weak credits, are submitted to\n\nsub-portfolio level, and are generally conducted to assess the impact of changing economic conditions on asset quality, earnings performance, capital adequacy and liquidity. DBS' stress testing programme is\n\ncomprehensive and covers a range of risks and business areas.\n\nDBS typically performs the following types of credit stress testing at a minimum and others as necessary:\n\nDBS conducts Pillar 1 cyclicality stress testing regularly as required by regulators. Under Pillar 1 cyclicality stress testing, DBS assesses the impact of a mild stress scenario (at least two consecutive quarters of zero growth) on Internal Ratings-Based (IRB) estimates (i.e. PD, LGD and EAD) and the impact on regulatory capital. The purpose of the Pillar 1 cyclicality stress test is to assess the robustness of internal credit risk models and the cushion above minimum regulatory capital.\n\nDBS conducts Pillar 2 credit stress testing once a year as part of the ICAAP. Under Pillar 2 credit stress testing, DBS assesses the impact of stress scenarios, with di \u038a erent levels of severity, on asset quality, earnings performance as well as internal and regulatory capital. The results of the credit stress test form inputs to the capital planning process under ICAAP. The purpose of the Pillar 2 credit stress testing is to examine, in a rigorous and forward-looking manner, the possible events or changes in market conditions that could adversely impact DBS and to develop the appropriate action plan.\n\nDBS participates in the annual industry-wide stress test (IWST) conducted by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) to facilitate the ongoing assessment of Singapore's \u038b nancial stability. Under the IWST, DBS is required to assess the impact of adverse scenarios, as de \u038b ned by the regulator, on asset quality, earnings performance and capital adequacy, where applicable.\n\nDBS also conducts multiple independent sensitivity analyses and credit portfolio reviews based on various scenarios. The intent of these analyses and reviews is to identify vulnerabilities for the purpose of developing and executing mitigating actions. For example, climate transition and physical risk scenario analyses are conducted as part of the regulatory-driven pilot climate stress test exercises to assess the potential vulnerabilities of our portfolios to short and longterm climate transition and physical risks.\n\nthe various risk committees, allowing key strategies and action plans to be formulated and evaluated. Credit control functions also ensure that any credit risk taken complies with the credit risk policies and standards. These functions ensure that approved limits are activated, credit excesses and policy exceptions are appropriately endorsed, compliance with credit standards is carried out, and covenants established are monitored.\n\nIndependent risk management functions that report to the CRO are jointly responsible for developing and maintaining a robust credit stress testing programme. These units oversee the implementation of credit stress tests as well as the analysis of the results, of which management, various risk committees and regulators are informed.\n\n## Non-performing assets\n\nDBS' credit facilities are classi \u038b ed as 'Performing assets' or 'Non-performing assets' (NPA), in accordance with the MAS Notice to Banks No. 612 'Credit Files, Grading and Provisioning' (MAS Notice 612).\n\nCredit exposures are categorised into one of the following \u038b ve categories, according to our assessment of a borrower's ability to repay a credit facility from its normal sources of income and/ or the repayment behaviour of the borrower.\n\n| Classi \u038b  cation grade   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Performing assets        | Performing assets                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n| Pass                     | Indicates that the timely repayment of the outstanding credit facilities is not in doubt.                                                                                                                                                     |\n| Special mention          | Indicates that the borrower exhibits potential weaknesses that, if not corrected in a timely manner, may  adversely a \u038a  ect future repayments and warrant close attention by DBS.                                                            |\n| Classi \u038b   ed or NPA     | Classi \u038b   ed or NPA                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n| Substandard              | Indicates that the borrower exhibits de \u038b  nable weaknesses in its business, cash  \u038c  ow or  \u038b  nancial position  that may jeopardise repayment on existing terms.                                                                            |\n| Doubtful                 | Indicates that the borrower exhibits severe weaknesses such that the prospect of full recovery of the  outstanding credit facilities is questionable and the prospect of a loss is high, but the exact amount  remains undeterminable as yet. |\n| Loss                     | Indicates that the outstanding credit facility is not collectable, and little or nothing can be done to recover  the outstanding amount from any collateral or from the assets of the borrower generally.                                     |\n\nA default is considered to have occurred with regard to a particular borrower when either or both of the following events have taken place:\n\n- \u00b7 Subjective default: Borrower is considered to be unlikely to pay its credit obligations in full, without DBS taking action such as realising security (if held)\n- \u00b7 Technical default: Borrower is more than 90 days past due on any credit obligation to DBS\n\nFor retail borrowers, the categorisation into the respective MAS loan grades is at the facility level and consistent with MAS Notice 612.\n\nCredit facilities are classi \u038b ed as restructured assets when we grant non-commercial concessions to a borrower because its \u038b nancial position has deteriorated or is unable to meet the original repayment schedule. A restructured credit facility is classi \u038b ed into the appropriate non- performing grade based on the assessment of the borrower's \u038b nancial condition and its ability to repay according to the restructured terms.\n\nSuch credit facilities are not returned to the performing status until there are reasonable grounds to conclude that the borrower will be able to service all future principal and interest payments on the credit facility in accordance with the restructured terms and MAS Notice 612. Apart from what has been described, we do not grant concessions to borrowers in the normal course of business.\n\nIn addition, it is not within DBS' business model to acquire debts that have been restructured at inception (e.g. distressed debts).\n\nRefer to Note 2.11 to the \u0234 nancial statements on page 129 for our accounting policies regarding speci \u0234 c and general allowances for credit losses.\n\nIn general, speci \u038b c allowances are recognised for defaulting credit exposures rated substandard and below.\n\nThe breakdown of our NPA by loan grading and industry and the related amounts of speci \u0234 c allowances can be found in Note 42.2 to the \u0234 nancial statements on page 170. A breakdown of past due loans can also be found in the same note.\n\nWhen required, we will take possession of all collateral and dispose them as soon as practicable. Realised proceeds are used to reduce outstanding indebtedness.\n\nA breakdown of collateral held for NPA is shown in Note 42.2 to the \u0234 nancial statements on page 172.\n\nRepossessed collateral is classi \u038b ed in the balance sheet as Other assets. The amounts of such Other assets for 2022 and 2023 were not material.\n\n## 5.2 Credit risk mitigants\n\n## Collateral received\n\nWhere possible, DBS takes collateral as a secondary source of repayment. This includes, but is not limited to, cash, marketable securities, real estate, trade receivables, inventory, equipment, and other physical and/ or \u038b nancial collateral. We may also take \u038b xed and \u038c oating charges on the assets of borrowers.\n\nPolicies are in place to determine the eligibility of collateral for credit risk mitigation. Collateral is generally diversi \u038b ed and periodic valuations of collateral are required.\n\nReal estate constitutes the bulk of our collateral, with a signi \u038b cantly lower proportion in marketable securities and cash.\n\nFor derivatives, repurchase agreements (repo) and other repo-style transactions with \u038b nancial market counterparties, collateral arrangements are typically covered under market-standard documentation, such as International Swaps & Derivatives Association (ISDA) Agreements and Master Repurchase Agreements.\n\nThe collateral exchanged mitigates markedto-market changes at a re-margining frequency that DBS and the counterparties have mutually agreed upon. This is governed by internal guidelines with respect to collateral eligibility. In the event of a default, the credit risk exposure is reduced by masternetting arrangements where DBS is allowed to o \u038a set what is owed to a counterparty against what is due from that counterparty in a netting-eligible jurisdiction.\n\nRefer to Note 14 to the \u0234 nancial statements on page 141 for further information on \u0234 nancial assets and liabilities subject to netting agreement but not o \u038d set on the balance sheet.\n\nCollateral held against derivatives generally consists of cash in major currencies and highly rated government or quasigovernment bonds. Exceptions may arise in certain countries, where due to domestic capital markets and business conditions, the bank may be required to accept less highly rated or liquid government bonds and currencies. Reverse repo-transactions are generally traded with large institutions with reasonably good credit standing. DBS takes haircuts against the underlying collateral of these transactions that commensurate with collateral quality to ensure credit risks are adequately mitigated.\n\nIn times of di \u038d culty, we will review the customers' speci \u038b c situation and circumstances to assist them in restructuring their \u038b nancial obligations.\n\nHowever, should the need arise, disposal and recovery processes are in place to dispose the collateral held. DBS maintains a panel of agents and solicitors to assist in the disposal of non-liquid assets and specialised equipment quickly.",

        "page_content": "## Collateral posted\n\nDBS is required to post additional collateral in the event of a rating downgrade. As at 31 December 2023, for a three-notch downgrade of its Standard & Poor's Ratings Services and Moody's Investors Services ratings, DBS will have to post additional collateral amounting to SGD 26 million (2022: SGD 11 million).\n\n## Other credit risk mitigants\n\nDBS accepts guarantees as credit risk mitigants. Internal requirements for considering the eligibility of guarantors for credit risk mitigation are in place.\n\n## 5.3 Internal credit risk models\n\nDBS adopts rating systems for the di \u038a erent asset classes under the Internal Ratings Based Approach (IRBA).\n\nThere is a robust governance process for the development, independent validation and approval of any credit risk model.\n\nThe models go through a rigorous review process before they are endorsed by the GCRMC and Risk EXCO. They must also be approved by the BRMC before submission for regulatory approval. The key risk measures generated by the internal credit risk rating models to quantify regulatory capital include PD, LGD and EAD. For portfolios under the Foundation IRBA, internal estimates of PD are used while the supervisory LGD and EAD estimates are applied. For portfolios under the Advanced IRBA, internal estimates of PD, LGD and EAD are used. In addition, the ratings from the credit models act as the basis for underwriting credit risk, monitoring portfolio performance and determining business strategies. The performance of the rating systems is monitored regularly and reported to the GCRMC, Risk EXCO and BRMC to ensure their ongoing e \u038a ectiveness.\n\nAn independent risk unit conducts formal validations for the respective rating systems annually. The validation processes are also independently reviewed by Group Audit. These serve to highlight material deterioration in the rating systems for management attention.\n\n## 5.3.1 Retail exposure\n\nRetail exposures are categorised into the following asset classes under the Advanced IRBA: residential mortgages, qualifying revolving retail exposures, and other retail exposures.\n\nWithin each asset class, exposures are managed on a portfolio basis. Each customer or account is assigned to a risk\n\npool, considering factors such as borrower characteristics and collateral type. PD, EAD and LGD estimates are based on internal historical default, utilisation and realised losses within a de \u038b ned period.\n\nProduct-speci \u038b c credit risk elements such as underwriting criteria, scoring models, approving authorities, asset quality, and business strategy reviews, as well as systems, processes and techniques to monitor portfolio performance, are in place. Credit risk models for secured and unsecured portfolios are also used to update the risk level of each loan on a monthly basis, re \u038c ecting the broad usage of risk models in portfolio quality reviews.\n\n## 5.3.2 Wholesale exposure\n\nWholesale exposures are largely under the Foundation IRBA for capital computation. They include sovereign, bank and corporate. Specialised lending exposures are under IRBA using supervisory slotting criteria.\n\nSovereign exposures are risk-rated using internal risk-rating models. Factors related to country-speci \u038b c macroeconomic risk, political risk, social risk and liquidity risk are included in the sovereign rating models to assess the sovereign credit risk in an objective and systematic manner.\n\nBank exposures are assessed using the bank-rating model. The model considers both quantitative and qualitative factors such as capital levels and liquidity, asset quality and management strength.\n\nLarge corporate exposures are assessed using internal rating model. Factors considered in the risk assessment process include the counterparty's \u038b nancial strength and qualitative factors such as industry risk, access to funding, market standing and management strength.\n\nSME credit rating models consider risk factors such as those relating to the counterparty's \u038b nancial strength, qualitative factors, as well as account performance.\n\nCredit risk ratings under the IRBA portfolios are, at a minimum, reviewed by designated approvers on an annual basis unless credit conditions require more frequent assessment.\n\n## 5.3.3 Specialised lending exposures\n\nSpecialised lending IRBA portfolios include income-producing real estate, project \u038b nance, object \u038b nance, and commodities \u038b nance. These adopt the supervisory slotting criteria speci \u038b ed under Annex 7v of MAS Notice 637, which are used to determine the risk weights to calculate credit risk-weighted exposures.\n\n## 5.3.4 Securitisation exposures\n\nWe arrange securitisation transactions for our clients for fees. These transactions do not involve special-purpose entities that we control. For transactions that are not underwritten, no securitisation exposures are assumed as a direct consequence of arranging the transactions. Any decision to invest in any of such arranged transactions is subject to independent risk assessment.\n\nWhere DBS provides an underwriting commitment, any securitisation exposure that arises will be held in the trading book to be traded or sold down in accordance with our internal policy and risk limits. In addition, DBS does not provide implicit support for any transactions we structure or have invested in.\n\nWe invest in our clients' securitisation transactions from time to time. These may include securitisation transactions arranged by us or with other parties.\n\nWe may also act as a liquidity facility provider, working capital facility provider or swap counterparty. Such securitisation exposures require the approval of the independent risk function and are subject to regular risk reviews. We also have processes in place to monitor the credit risk of our securitisation exposures.\n\n## 5.3.5 Credit exposures falling outside internal credit risk models\n\nDBS applies the Standardised Approach (SA) for portfolios that are expected to transit to IRBA or for portfolios that are immaterial in terms of size and risk pro \u038b le. These portfolios include:\n\n- \u00b7 IRBA-transitioning retail and wholesale exposures\n- \u00b7 IRBA-exempt retail exposures\n- \u00b7 IRBA-exempt wholesale exposures\n\nAny identi \u038b ed transitioning retail and/ or wholesale exposures are expected to adopt Advanced or Foundation IRBA, subject to approval by regulators. Prior to regulatory approval, these portfolios are under SA.\n\nThe portfolios under the SA are subject to our overall governance framework and credit risk management practices. DBS continues to monitor the size and risk pro \u038b le of these portfolios and will enhance the relevant risk measurement processes if these risk exposures become material.\n\nDBS uses external ratings for credit exposures under the SA where relevant, and we only accept ratings from Standard & Poor's, Moody's and Fitch in such cases. DBS follows the process prescribed in MAS Notice 637 to map the ratings to the relevant risk weights.\n\n## 5.4 Credit risk in 2023\n\n## Concentration risk\n\nDBS' concentration risk remained well managed across geographies and industry/ business segments.\n\nOur geographic distribution of customer loans remained stable.\n\nSingapore, our home market, continued to account for the largest share of our gross loans and advances to customers, contributing to 46% of our total portfolio.\n\nOur portfolio is well diversi \u038b ed across industry and business segments. Building and Construction, General Commerce and Manufacturing remained the largest contributors in the wholesale portfolio, accounting for 46% of the total portfolio.\n\n## Non-performing assets\n\nNew non-performing asset (NPA) formation was o \u038a set by recoveries and write-o \u038a s. In absolute terms, our total NPA decreased by 1% from the previous year to SGD 5.06 billion and non-performing loans (NPL) ratio remained constant at 1.1% in 2023.\n\nRefer to 'CFO Statement' on page 20.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAbove refers to gross loans and advances to customers based on country of incorporation\n\nAbove refers to gross loans and advances to customers based on MAS Industry Code\n\nRefer to Note 42.4 to the \u0234 nancial statements on page 173 for DBS' breakdown of credit risk concentration.\n\n## Collateral received\n\nThe tables below provide breakdowns by loan-to-value (LTV) bands for the borrowings secured by real estate and other collateral from the various market segments.\n\n## Residential mortgage loans\n\nThe LTV ratio is calculated using mortgage loans including undrawn commitments\n\ndivided by the collateral value. Property valuations are determined using a combination of professional appraisals and housing price indices.\n\nFor Singapore mortgage loans, the increases in property price index for HDB and private residential properties resulted in a 5.4%\n\nincrease in the proportion of mortgage exposure in the Up to 50% LTV band.\n\nFor Hong Kong mortgage loans, the decrease in property price index resulted in a 6.6% increase in the proportion of mortgage exposure in the 51% to 80% LTV band.",

More than 90% of such loans were fully collateralised and majority of these loans had LTV < 80%. Our property loans were mainly concentrated in Singapore and Hong Kong, which together accounted for about 80% of the total property loans.\n\nThe LTV ratio is calculated as loans and advances divided by the value of collaterals that secure the same facility. Real estate forms a substantial portion of the collaterals; other collaterals such as cash, marketable securities, and bank guarantees are also included.\n\n## Percentage of loans and advances to corporates secured by real estate (breakdown by LTV band and geography)\n\n## As at 31 December 2023\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Loans and advances to banks\n\nIn line with market convention, loans and advances to banks are typically unsecured.

This policy is supplemented with standards and guides, which facilitate the identi \u038b cation, measurement, control, monitoring and reporting of market risk in a consistent manner. They also set out the overall approach, requirements and controls governing market risk stress testing across DBS.\n\nThe criteria for determining the positions to be included in the trading book are stipulated in the Trading Book Policy Statement.\n\n## Risk methodologies\n\nDBS utilises Value-at-Risk (VaR), a statistical risk measure, to estimate the potential loss from market movements. This measure uses historical simulation based on data for the previous 12 months. It assumes that historical changes in market values re \u038c ect the distribution of potential outcomes in the immediate future.\n\nDBS limits and monitors market risk exposures using Expected Shortfall (ES). ES is estimated by averaging the portfolio's potential losses beyond the 97.5% con \u038b dence interval, under normal market conditions and over a one-day holding period.\n\nES is supplemented with other risk control metrics such as sensitivities to risk factors and loss triggers for management action.\n\nDBS conducts backtesting to verify the predictiveness of the VaR model. Backtesting compares VaR calculated for positions at the close of each business day with the pro \u038b t and loss (P&L) that arises from those positions on the following business day. The backtesting P&L excludes fees and commissions, revenues from intra-day trading, non-daily valuation adjustments and time e \u038a ects.\n\nFor backtesting, VaR at the 99% con \u038b dence interval and over a one-day holding period is used. We adopt the standardised approach to compute market risk regulatory capital under MAS Notice 637 and MAS Notice FHC-N637 for the trading book positions. As such, VaR backtesting does not impact our regulatory capital for market risk.\n\nThere are limitations to VaR models; for example, past changes in market risk factors may not provide accurate predictions of future market movements, and the risk arising from adverse market events may not be considered.\n\nTo monitor DBS' vulnerability to unexpected but plausible extreme market risk-related events, we conduct multiple market risk stress tests regularly. These cover trading and nontrading portfolios and follow a combination of historical and hypothetical scenarios depicting risk-factor movement.\n\nInterest Rate Risk in the Banking Book (IRRBB) arises from mismatches in the interest rate pro \u038b les of assets, liabilities and capital instruments. DBS identi \u038b es, measures and manages IRRBB from both economic value and earning perspectives using Economic Value of Equity ('EVE') and Net Interest Income ('NII') variability as the respective key risk metrics. Estimating IRRBB requires the use of behavioural models and assumptions on certain parameters such as loan prepayment, \u038b xed deposits early redemption and the duration of non-maturity deposits. DBS measures IRRBB on a monthly basis.\n\n## Processes, systems and reports\n\nRobust internal control processes and systems have been designed and implemented to support our market risk management approach. DBS reviews these control processes and systems regularly, and these reviews allow senior management to assess their e \u038a ectiveness.\n\nThe RMG Market and Liquidity Risk unit an independent market risk management function reporting to the CRO - monitors, controls and analyses DBS' market risk daily. The unit comprises risk control, risk analytics, production and reporting teams.",

Interest Rate Risk in the Banking Book (IRRBB) is measured by the change in Economic Value of Equity (EVE) and Net Interest Income (NII). The rate shock scenarios follow MAS Notice 637 Annex 10C where interest rate shocks are prescribed for each currency. For example, the parallel scenario simulations for our material currencies use a rate shock of 150 basis points for Singapore Dollar and a rate shock of 200 basis points for US Dollar and Hong Kong Dollar. Under the parallel up and down scenarios, all-currency NII is estimated to increase by SGD 1,524 million and decrease by SGD 1,747 million respectively.

We seek to manage our liquidity to ensure that our liquidity obligations will continue to be honoured under normal as well as adverse circumstances.\n\n## 7.1 Liquidity risk management at DBS\n\n## Approach to liquidity risk management\n\nDBS' approach to liquidity risk management comprises the following building blocks:\n\n## Policies\n\n## Risk methodologies\n\n## Processes, systems and reports\n\n## Policies\n\nThe Group Liquidity Risk Management Policy sets our overall approach towards liquidity risk management and describes the range of strategies we employ to manage our liquidity.\n\nThese strategies include maintaining an adequate counterbalancing capacity to address potential cash \u038c ow shortfalls and having diversi \u038b ed sources of liquidity.\n\nDBS' counterbalancing capacity includes liquid assets, the capacity to borrow from the money markets (including the issuance of commercial papers and covered bonds), and forms of managerial interventions that improve liquidity. In the event of a potential or actual crisis, we have in place a set of liquidity contingency and recovery plans to ensure that we maintain adequate liquidity.\n\n## Funding sources (SGD billion)\n\n## Wholesale Funding Breakdown (SGD billion)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWholesale funding was largely realigned to longer-tenor funding to meet local regulatory requirements for selected overseas markets.\n\nDBS aims to maintain continuous access to the investor base for capital, covered bonds and senior wholesale funding to support our commercial banking activities. We seek cost e \u038d ciencies and broaden our investor base with proactive engagement via regular issuances. Capital instruments are primarily issued from DBS Group Holdings Ltd (DBSH) while covered bonds are primarily issued from DBS Bank Ltd. Senior notes are issued from both DBSH and the Bank as required.\n\nThe Group Liquidity Risk Management Policy is supported by standards that establish the detailed requirements for liquidity risk identi \u038b cation, measurement, reporting and control within DBS. The set of policies, standards and supporting guides communicate these baseline requirements to ensure a consistent application throughout DBS.\n\n## Risk methodologies\n\nThe primary measure used to manage liquidity within the tolerance de \u038b ned by the Board is cash \u038c ow maturity mismatch analysis.\n\nThis form of analysis is performed on a regular basis under normal and adverse scenarios. It assesses the adequacy of our counterbalancing capacity to fund or mitigate any cash \u038c ow shortfalls that may occur as forecasted in the cash \u038c ow movements across successive time bands. To ensure that liquidity is managed in line with our Risk Appetite, core parameters such as the types of scenarios, the survival period and the minimum level of liquid assets, are pre-speci \u038b ed for monitoring and control on a group-wide basis. Any occurrences of forecasted shortfalls that cannot be covered by our counterbalancing capacity will be escalated to the relevant committees for evaluation and action.\n\nLiquidity risk stress testing is performed regularly using cash \u038c ow maturity mismatch analysis, and covers adverse scenarios including general market and idiosyncratic stress scenarios. Stress tests assess our vulnerability when liability run-o \u038a s increase, asset rollovers increase and/ or liquid asset bu \u038a ers decrease. In addition, ad hoc stress tests are performed as part of our recovery planning and ICAAP exercises.\n\nLiquidity risk control measures such as liquidity-related ratios and balance sheet analysis are complementary tools for cash \u038c ow maturity mismatch analysis, and they are performed regularly to obtain deeper insights and \u038b ner control over our liquidity pro \u038b le across di \u038a erent locations.\n\nThe liquidity risk control measures also include concentration measures regarding top depositors, wholesale borrowing and swapped funds ratios.\n\n## Processes, systems and reports\n\nRobust internal control processes and systems support our overall approach in identifying, measuring, aggregating, controlling and monitoring liquidity risk across DBS. Continuous improvement in data and reporting platforms has allowed most elements of internal liquidity risk reporting to be centralised.\n\nThe RMG Market and Liquidity Risk unit manages the day-to-day liquidity risk monitoring, control reporting and analysis.\n\n## Liquidity management and funding strategy\n\nDBS strives to develop a diversi \u038b ed funding base with access to funding sources across retail and wholesale channels in both Singapore dollar and foreign currencies. Our funding strategy is anchored on the strength of our core deposit franchise and is augmented by our established long-term funding capabilities.\n\nThe diagrams below show our funding structure as at 31 December 2023. Loan-deposit ratio remains healthy at 77.8%.\n\nRefer to Note 30 to the \u0234 nancial statements on page 151 for more details of our wholesale funding sources and Note 43.1 on page 175 for the contractual maturity pro \u0234 le of our assets and liabilities.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGrowth in the regional franchise generates price, volume, currency and tenor mismatches between our assets and liabilities. To this end, where practicable and transferable without loss in value, we make appropriate use of swap markets for relevant currencies, commensurate with the liquidity of each, in the conversion and deployment of surplus funds across locations.\n\nAs these swaps typically mature earlier than loans, we are exposed to potential cash \u038c ow mismatches arising from the risk that counterparties may not roll over maturing swaps to support our ongoing funding needs.\n\nThis risk is mitigated by triggers set on the number of swaps transacted with the market and by conservative assumptions on the cash \u038c ow behaviour of swaps under our cash \u038c ow maturity gap analysis (refer to Section 7.2 on page 93).\n\nIn general, the term borrowing needs are managed centrally by the head o \u038d ce in consultation with our overseas locations, subject to relevant regulatory restrictions and to an appropriate level of presence and participation required by the respective local funding markets.\n\nThe Group Asset and Liability Committee and respective Location Asset and Liability Committees regularly review the composition and growth trajectories of the relevant balance sheets and re \u038b ne our funding strategy according to business momentum, competitive factors and prevailing market conditions.\n\n## 7.2 Liquidity risk in 2023\n\nDBS actively monitors and manages our liquidity pro \u038b le through cash \u038c ow maturity mismatch analysis.\n\nIn forecasting cash \u038c ow under the analysis, behavioural pro \u038b ling is necessary in cases\n\nwhere a product has indeterminate maturity or the contractual maturity does not realistically re \u038c ect the expected cash \u038c ow.\n\nTwo examples are maturity-indeterminate savings and current account deposits, which are generally viewed as sources of stable funding for commercial banks. A conservative view is adopted in the behavioural pro \u038b ling of assets, liabilities and o \u038a -balance sheet commitments that have exhibited cash \u038c ow patterns that di \u038a er signi \u038b cantly from the contractual maturity pro \u038b le shown under Note 43.1 of our \u038b nancial statements on page 175.\n\nThe table below shows our behavioural net and cumulative maturity mismatch between assets and liabilities over a one-year period, in a normal scenario without incorporating growth projections.

        "page_content": "## 7.3 Liquid assets\n\nLiquid assets are assets that are readily available and can be easily monetised to meet obligations and expenses under times of stress.\n\nSuch assets are internally de \u038b ned under the governance of the relevant oversight committees, taking into account the asset class, issuer type and credit rating, among other criteria, before they are re \u038c ected as available funds through cash \u038c ow maturity mismatch analysis. DBS' Treasury function expects to be able to operationally monetise our pool of liquid assets to meet liquidity shortfalls when the need arises. These liquid assets must be unencumbered and free of any legal, regulatory, contractual or other restrictions.\n\nIn practice, liquid assets are maintained in key locations and currencies to ensure that operating entities in such locations possess a degree of self-su \u038d ciency to support business needs and guard against contingencies. The main portion of our liquid assets is centrally maintained in Singapore to support liquidity needs in smaller overseas subsidiaries and branches. Internally, DBS sets a requirement to maintain its pool of liquid assets above a minimum level as a source of contingent funds, taking into account regulatory recommended liquid asset levels as well as internally projected stress shortfalls under the cash \u038c ow maturity mismatch analysis.\n\nThe table below shows DBS' encumbered and unencumbered liquid assets by instrument and counterparty against other assets in the same category under the balance sheet.

Group LCR has been maintained well above the minimum LCR requirements of 100% for both all-currency and SGD.\n\nDBS' LCR is sensitive to balance sheet movements resulting from commercial loan/ deposit activities, wholesale inter-bank lending/ borrowing, and to the maturity tenor changes of these positions as they fall into or out of the LCR 30-day tenor. In order to meet the LCR requirements, DBS holds a pool of unencumbered High Quality Liquid Assets (HQLA) comprising predominantly cash, balances with central banks and highly rated bonds issued by governments or supranational entities.\n\n## 7.5 Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR)\n\nDBS is subject to the Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) under MAS Notice to Banks No. 652 'Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR)' (MAS Notice 652). Group NSFR has been maintained consistently above the minimum regulatory requirement of 100%.\n\nNSFR aims to improve the resiliency of banks by promoting long term funding stability. We manage our NSFR by maintaining a stable balance sheet supported by a diversi \u038b ed funding base with access to funding sources across retail and wholesale channels.\n\n## 8 Operational and Technology Risk\n\nOperational risk is inherent in our business activities and may arise from inadequate or failed internal processes, people, systems, or from external events. DBS' objective is to keep operational risk at appropriate levels, taking into account the markets we operate in, the characteristics of the businesses as well as our economic and regulatory environment.\n\n## 8.1 Operational risk management at DBS\n\nDBS' approach to operational risk management comprises the following building blocks:\n\n## Policies\n\nRisk methodologies\n\nProcesses, systems and reports\n\n## Policies\n\nThe Group Operational Risk Management (ORM) Policy sets our overall approach for managing operational risk in a structured, systematic and consistent manner.\n\nThere are policies, standards, tools and programmes in place to govern ORM practices across DBS. These include corporate operational risk policies and standards that are owned by the respective corporate oversight and control functions. The key policies address risk areas relating to technology, compliance, fraud, money laundering, \u038b nancing of terrorism and sanctions, new product, outsourcing and ecosystem partnership.\n\n## Risk methodologies\n\nDBS adopts the standardised approach to compute operational risk regulatory capital.\n\nTo manage and control operational risk, we use various tools, including risk and control self-assessment (RCSA), operational risk event management and key risk indicator monitoring.\n\nDBS' Three Lines Model adopts one common risk taxonomy, and a consistent risk assessment approach to managing operational risk. RCSA is conducted by each\n\nbusiness or support unit to identify key operational risk and assess the e \u038a ectiveness of internal controls. When control issues are identi \u038b ed, the units develop action plans and track the resolution of the issues.\n\nOperational risk events are classi \u038b ed in accordance with Basel standards. Such events, including any signi \u038b cant incidents that may impact DBS' reputation, must be reported based on certain established thresholds. Key risk indicators with pre-de \u038b ned escalation triggers are employed to facilitate risk monitoring in a forward-looking manner.\n\nAdditional methodologies are in place to address subject-speci \u038b c risks, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\n## Compliance risk\n\nCompliance risk refers to the risk of DBS not being able to successfully conduct our business because of any failure to comply with laws, regulatory requirements, industry codes or standards of business and professional conduct applicable to the \u038b nancial sector.\n\nThis includes, in particular, laws and regulations applicable to the licensing and conducting of banking or other \u038b nancial businesses, \u038b nancial crime such as antimoney laundering and countering the \u038b nancing of terrorism, fraud and bribery/ corruption. We maintain a compliance programme designed to identify, assess, measure, mitigate and report on such risks through a combination of policy and relevant systems and controls.\n\nTo counter \u038b nancial crime and sanctions risks, DBS established minimum standards for our business and support units to manage our actual and/ or potential risk exposures. In addition, standards aimed to provide the end-to-end management for fraud and related issues at the unit and geographical levels, are implemented through the Fraud Management Programme. We implement surveillance and compliance testing controls where necessary to obtain assurance that the control framework is operating e \u038a ectively.\n\nDBS also provides relevant training and implements assurance processes. We strongly believe in the need to promote a strong compliance culture as well, and this is developed through the leadership of our Board and senior management.\n\n## New product, outsourcing and ecosystem partnership risks\n\nEach new product, service, outsourcing arrangement or ecosystem partnership is subject to a risk review and sign-o \u038a process, where relevant risks are identi \u038b ed and assessed. Variations of existing products or services and existing outsourcing arrangements and ecosystem partnerships are also subject to a similar process.\n\n## Other mitigation programmes\n\nA robust business continuity management programme is in place to ensure that essential\n\nbanking services can continue in the event of unforeseen events or business disruptions. This includes a crisis management plan to enable quick response to manage incidents. Exercises are conducted annually, simulating di \u038a erent scenarios to test business continuity plans and crisis management protocol. The e \u038a ectiveness of these exercises as well as DBS' business continuity readiness and our alignment to regulatory guidelines are communicated and attested by senior management to the BRMC annually.\n\nTo mitigate losses from speci \u038b c risk events which are unexpected and signi \u038b cant, DBS e \u038a ects group-wide insurance coverage under the Group Insurance Programme. These insurance policies relate to crime and professional indemnity, directors and o \u038d cers liability, cybersecurity risk, property damage and business interruption, general liability and terrorism.\n\n## Processes, systems and reports\n\nRobust internal control processes and systems are integral to identifying, assessing, monitoring, managing and reporting operational risk.\n\nAll units are responsible for the day-to-day management of operational risk in their products, processes, systems and activities, in accordance with the various frameworks and policies. The RMG Operational Risk unit and other corporate oversight and control functions:\n\n- \u00b7 Oversee and monitor the e \u038a ectiveness of operational risk management\n- \u00b7 Assess key operational risk issues with the units\n- \u00b7 Report and/ or escalate key operational risks to risk committees with recommendations on appropriate risk mitigation strategies\n\nDBS has in place an integrated governance, risk and compliance system with aligned risk assessment methodology, common taxonomy, and uni \u038b ed processes for the Three Lines Model. We have in place an operational risk landscape pro \u038b le which provides the Board and senior management with an integrated view of DBS' operational risk pro \u038b le periodically, across key operational risk areas and business lines.\n\n## 8.2 Technology risk management in 2023\n\n## Technology risk\n\nInformation Technology (IT) risk is managed through an enterprise technology risk management approach. This covers risk identi \u038b cation, assessment, mitigation, monitoring and reporting. In addition, the appropriate governance, IT policies and standards, control processes and risk mitigation programmes are in place to support the risk management approach.\n\nArising from multiple digital disruptions in 2023, a comprehensive technology risk management\n\nroadmap has been put in place to address gaps in technology risk governance and oversight, incident management, system resilience and change management.\n\nThe bank has established a new subcommittee of the Board Risk Management Committee (BRMC) called the BRMC Technology Risk Committee (BTRC) for dedicated oversight of technology risk.\n\nTo enhance independent checks and balances, we transferred the Technology Risk Management team to the Risk Management Group with new leadership and expanded bench strength. We strengthened our site reliability engineering with new leadership and also created a new Quality Assurance function to provide an additional independent layer of veri \u038b cation, controls and checks over the bank's change management process. A new Group Technology Risk Committee (GTRC) was constituted to enhance the oversight and management of technology risk by senior management.\n\nRelating to incident management, we have established clearer ownership and management of incidents within the bank, as well as between the bank and its service providers and vendors. We also embarked on proactive problem management through the active review of early warning indicators, identi \u038b cation of other possibly a \u038a ected areas, and taking preventive actions.\n\n## Cybersecurity risk\n\nCybersecurity risk remains a top priority for our bank. Our Chief Information Security O \u038d cer (CISO) is responsible for overseeing the cybersecurity function, serving as the central authority for all cybersecurity matters in relation to technology and operational cyber risks, data protection, and compliance with cybersecurity regulations. At DBS, we place a strong emphasis on safeguarding our people, information, network, equipment, and applications in alignment with the bank's risk tolerance.\n\nTo ensure we are proactive in addressing cyber threats, DBS allocates signi \u038b cant resources towards enhancing our cyber hygiene and control environment. We are committed to staying in tandem with the ever-evolving cyber threat landscape. As the second line, the CISO o \u038d ce conducts regular assessments to validate the e \u038a ectiveness of our controls and to obtain assurance that our control framework remains resilient in the face of emerging and evolving threats.\n\nFurthermore, at DBS, we are dedicated to promoting a culture of cybersecurity risk awareness. We believe that a strong security culture starts with our employees. As such, we provide relevant training and educational resources to empower our sta \u038a to recognise and respond to cybersecurity risks e \u038a ectively. By fostering this culture of awareness, we not only enhance our defence against cyber threats but also ensure that cybersecurity is a shared responsibility across our organisation.",

        "page_content": "## 8.3 Operational risk in 2023\n\nThe total operational risk losses in 2023 were SGD 10 million (0.05%) of DBS' total operating income), compared with SGD 13 million (0.08%) in 2022. The losses may be categorised into the following seven Basel risk event types:\n\n| Basel risk event types                     | 2023        | 2023   | 2022        | 2022   |\n|--------------------------------------------|-------------|--------|-------------|--------|\n|                                            | SGD million | %      | SGD million | %      |\n| Business disruption and system failures    | 2.79        | 28%    | 1.13        | 9%     |\n| Clients, products and business practices   | 2.56        | 26%    | 0.82        | 7%     |\n| Damage to physical asset                   | 0.02        | 0%     | 0.01        | 0%     |\n| Employment practices and workplace safety  | 0           | 0%     | 0.04        | 0%     |\n| Execution, delivery and process management | 2.43        | 24%    | 10.13       | 78%    |\n| External fraud                             | 1.88        | 19%    | 0.8         | 6%     |\n| Internal fraud                             | 0.34        | 3%     | 0.06        | 0%     |\n| Total (a)                                  | 10.02       | 100%   | 12.99       | 100%   |\n\nNotes\n\n(a) Reportable operational risk events are those with net loss greater than SGD 10,000 and are reported based on the date of detection\n\n'Business Disruption and System Failures' and 'Clients, Products and Business Practices' accounted for the highest share of our total losses in 2023 and the increases were largely attributable to one risk incident under each risk event type.\n\n## 9 Reputational Risk\n\nDBS views reputational risk typically as an outcome of any failure to manage risks in our day-to-day activities/ decisions, and from changes in the operating environment. These risks include:\n\n- \u00b7 Financial risk (credit, market and liquidity risks)\n- \u00b7 Inherent risk (operational and business/ strategic risks)\n\n## 9.1 Reputational risk management at DBS\n\nDBS' approach to reputational risk management comprises the following building blocks:\n\n## Policies\n\nRisk methodologies\n\nProcesses, systems and reports\n\n## Policies\n\nDBS adopts a four-step approach for reputational risk management, which is to prevent, detect, escalate and respond to reputational risk events.\n\nAs reputational risk is typically a consequence of the failure to manage other risk types, the de \u038b nitions and principles for managing such risks are articulated in the respective risk policies. These are reinforced by sound corporate values that re \u038c ect ethical behaviours and practices throughout DBS.\n\nAt DBS, we have policies in place to protect the consistency of our brand and to safeguard our corporate identity and reputation.\n\n## Risk methodologies\n\nUnder the various risk policies, we have established a number of mechanisms for ongoing risk monitoring.\n\nThese mechanisms take the form of risk limits, key risk indicators, conduct/ culture and other operating metrics, and include the periodic risk and control self-assessment process. Apart from observations from internal sources, alerts from external parties/ stakeholders also serve as an important source to detect potential reputational risk events. In addition, there are policies relating to media communications, social media and corporate social responsibility to protect DBS' reputation. There are also escalation and response mechanisms in place for managing reputational risk.\n\nWhile the respective risk policies address the individual risk types, the Reputational Risk Policy focuses speci \u038b cally on our stakeholders' perception of how well DBS manages its reputational risks. Stakeholders include customers, government agencies and regulators, investors, rating agencies, business alliances, vendors, trade unions, the media, the general public, the Board and senior management, and DBS' employees.\n\nWe recognise that creating a sense of shared value through engagement with key stakeholder groups is imperative for our brand and reputation.\n\nRead more about our stakeholder engagement on page 78.\n\n## Processes, systems and reports\n\nOur units are responsible for the day-to-day management of reputational risk, and ensure that processes and procedures are in place to identify, assess and respond to this risk. This includes social media monitoring to pick up adverse comments on DBS. Events a \u038a ecting DBS' reputational risk are also included in our reporting of risk pro \u038b les to senior management and Boardlevel committees.\n\n## 9.2 Reputational risk in 2023\n\nDBS' priority is to prevent the occurrence of a reputational risk event by adopting good risk attitudes and behaviours, instead of taking mitigating action when it occurs. DBS' reputation was impacted by the series of digital disruptions to DBS' banking services this year. A six-month pause on non-essential IT activities was instituted at DBS to focus on improving technology resiliency. The bank is addressing the issues at hand with utmost priority. This includes the rollout of a comprehensive roadmap to improve technology resiliency, encompassing both immediate and longer-term measures to strengthen technology governance, people/ leadership, systems and processes.\n\n## Capital management and planning\n\n## Objective\n\nThe Board of Directors (Board) is responsible for setting our capital management objective, which is to maintain a strong capital position consistent with regulatory requirements under the 'Notice on Risk Based Capital Adequacy Requirements for Banks Incorporated in Singapore' (MAS Notice 637) and 'Notice to Designated Financial Holding Companies FHC-N637 on Risk Based Capital Adequacy Requirements' (MAS Notice FHC-N637), and the expectations of various stakeholders including customers, investors and rating agencies. The Board articulates this objective in the form of capital targets, which are reviewed annually. This objective is pursued while delivering returns to shareholders and ensuring that adequate capital resources are available for business growth and investment opportunities as well as adverse situations, taking into consideration our strategic plans and risk appetite.\n\nOur dividend policy is to pay sustainable dividends that grow progressively with earnings. In line with this, the Board proposed a \u038b nal dividend of 54 cents per share, an increase of six cents from the previous payout. This brings the ordinary dividend for the \u038b nancial year to SGD 1.92 per share, an increase of 42 cents or 28% from the previous full year. The Scrip Dividend Scheme will not be applied to the \u038b nal dividend. In addition, the Board proposed a bonus issue on the basis of one bonus share for every existing 10 ordinary shares held. The bonus shares will qualify for dividend payments starting with the \u038b rst-quarter 2024 interim dividend, increasing the pace of capital returns to shareholders. Barring unforeseen circumstances, the annualised ordinary\n\ndividend going forward will be SGD 2.16 per share over the enlarged share base, which is an increase of 24% from 2023.\n\n## Process\n\nOur capital management objective is implemented via a capital management and planning process that is overseen by the Capital Committee. The Chief Financial O \u038d cer chairs the Capital Committee. The Capital Committee receives regular updates on our current and projected capital position. A key tool for capital planning is the annual Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP) through which we assess our projected capital supply and demand relative to regulatory requirements and capital targets. The ICAAP generally has a three-year horizon and covers various scenarios, including stress scenarios of di \u038a ering scope and severity.\n\nCapital capacity is allocated on two dimensions: by business line and by entity. Capital allocations by business line are set as part of the budget process and monitored during the year. Return on regulatory capital is one of several metrics used to measure business performance. Capital allocations by entity seek to optimise the distribution of capital resources across entities, taking into account the capital adequacy requirements imposed on each subsidiary in its respective jurisdiction. Capital is allocated to ensure that each subsidiary is able to comply with regulatory requirements as it executes its business strategy in line with our strategy.\n\nDuring the course of the year, these subsidiaries did not experience any impediments to the distribution of dividends.\n\n## Capital structure\n\nWe manage our capital structure in line with our capital management objective and seek to optimise the cost and \u038c exibility o \u038a ered by various capital resources. In order to achieve this, we assess the need and the opportunity to raise or retire capital. The following capital transactions were undertaken during the year.\n\n- \u00b7 DBS Group Holdings Ltd, on 20 January 2023, redeemed SGD 250 million 3.80% Subordinated Notes.\n- \u00b7 DBS Group Holdings Ltd, on 16 March 2023, redeemed AUD 750 million Floating Rate Subordinated Notes.\n- \u00b7 DBS Group Holdings Ltd, on 11 April 2023, redeemed EUR 600 million 1.50% Subordinated Notes.\n- \u00b7 DBS Group Holdings Ltd, on 15 May 2023, redeemed CNY 950 million 5.25% Subordinated Notes.\n- \u00b7 DBS Group Holdings Ltd, on 25 June 2023, redeemed JPY 7,300 million 0.85% Subordinated Notes.\n- \u00b7 DBS Group Holdings Ltd, on 11 December 2023, redeemed USD 750 million 4.52% Subordinated Notes.\n\nRefer to Note 32 to the \u0234 nancial statements for details on the movement of share capital during the year.\n\nRefer to Notes 31 and 33 to the \u0234 nancial statements as well as the Main Features of Capital Instruments document (https://www.dbs.com/investors/ \u0234 xedincome/capital-instruments) for the terms of the capital instruments that are included in Eligible Total Capital.",

Our CET1 CAR, as well as Tier 1 and Total CARs, comfortably exceeded the minimum CAR requirements under MAS Notice 637 and MAS Notice FHC-N637 of 9.0%, 10.5% and 12.5% respectively (this includes the capital conservation bu \u038a er but excludes the countercyclical capital bu \u038a er). The Group CARs had included the additional capital requirement imposed by the MAS on DBS Bank following disruptions to DBS Bank's digital banking services on 29 March 2023, and its digital banking and ATM services on 5 May 2023. The additional capital requirement on DBS Bank is now a multiplier of 1.8 times to its risk weighted assets for operational risk, an increase from the multiplier of 1.5 times that the MAS \u038b rst imposed on 7 February 2022 for disruptions which occurred during 23 to 25 November 2021. Notwithstanding the higher multiplier, the Group's capital ratios remained robust.\n\nAs at 31 December 2023, our consolidated leverage ratio stood at 6.6%, well above the 3.0% minimum ratio set by the MAS.\n\nRefer to 'Five-Year Summary' on page 187 for the historical trend of CET1, Tier 1 and Total CARs.

The applicable magnitude will be a weighted average of the jurisdiction-speci \u0234 c countercyclical bu \u038d er requirements that are required by national authorities in jurisdictions to which a bank has private sector credit exposures. The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision ('Basel Committee') expects jurisdictions to implement the countercyclical bu \u038d er during periods of excessive credit growth. Of the jurisdictions where we have material private sector credit exposures, Hong Kong has applied a countercyclical bu \u038d er of 2.5% from 1 January 2019, reducing to 2.0% from 14 October 2019 and 1.0% from 16 March 2020, and remained unchanged thereafter.\n\nThe MAS has designated DBS Bank as a domestic systemically important bank ('D-SIB'). Under the MAS' framework for identifying and supervising D-SIBs, the higher loss absorbency requirement for locally incorporated D-SIBs is met by the foregoing minimum ratios being two percentage points higher than those established by the Basel Committee. The Basel Committee has developed an indicator-based methodology for identifying global systemically important banks ('G-SIBs') on which higher loss absorbency requirements will be imposed. While we are not a G-SIB, we are required to disclose the 12 indicators which are included in the DBS Group's Pillar 3 disclosures published on DBS website (https://www.dbs.com/investors/default.page).\n\nOn 20 September 2023, the MAS published the revised MAS Notice 637 to implement the \u038b nal Basel III reforms. Most of the \u038b nal Basel III reforms in Singapore will come into e \u038a ect from 1 July 2024. Speci \u038b cally, the requirements in the revised MAS Notice 637 will take e \u038a ect as follows: (a) all standards other than the revised market risk and credit valuation adjustment ('CVA') standards will take e \u038a ect from 1 July 2024; (b) the revised market risk and CVA standards will take e \u038a ect from 1 July 2024 for compliance with supervisory reporting requirements, and with e \u038a ect from 1 July 2025 for compliance with capital adequacy and disclosure requirements; and (c) the output \u038c oor transitional arrangement will commence at 50% from 1 July 2024 and reach full phase-in at 72.5% from 1 January 2029.",

2030 targets and net zero 2050 targets for each of our priority sectors (1) . We have observed good emissions reduction progress, with \u038b ve out of seven sectors on track against the reference scenarios set. However, we recognise that in very hard-to-abate sectors, such as Steel (almost on track) and Shipping (not on track), there are dependencies and structural challenges that require long-term changes. Addressing these will often need broader ecosystem partnerships across the public and private sectors. We remain committed to working with our clients and fostering partnerships to enable an economy-wide transition to net zero that is orderly and just.

Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report.\n\nWe believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is su \u025d cient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\n## Independence\n\nWe are independent of the Group in accordance with the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority Code of Professional Conduct and Ethics for Public Accountants and Accounting Entities ('ACRA Code') together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the \u0234 nancial statements in Singapore, and we have ful \u0234 lled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the ACRA Code.\n\n## Our audit approach\n\n## Overview\n\n## Materiality\n\n- \u00b7 We determined the overall Group materiality based on 5% of the Group's pro \u0234 t before tax.\n\n## Group scoping\n\n- \u00b7 Full scope audit procedures were performed over the Singapore Operations of DBS Bank Ltd. and DBS Bank (Hong Kong) Limited ('signi \u0234 cant components').\n- \u00b7 We identi \u0234 ed as component entities ('other components') the branches of DBS Bank Ltd. Hong Kong, Taipei and London, as well as the subsidiaries DBS Bank (China) Limited, PT Bank DBS Indonesia, DBS Bank (Taiwan) Ltd and DBS Bank India Limited. This is where certain account balances were considered to be signi \u0234 cant in size in relation to the Group. Consequently, audit speci \u0234 ed procedures for the signi \u0234 cant account balances of these components were performed to obtain su \u025d cient and appropriate audit evidence.\n\n## Key audit matters\n\n- \u00b7 Speci \u0234 c allowances for loans and advances to customers\n- \u00b7 General allowances for credit losses (Stage 1 and 2 Expected Credit Loss)\n- \u00b7 Goodwill\n- \u00b7 Valuation of \u0234 nancial instruments held at fair value\n\nAs part of designing our audit, we determined materiality and assessed the risks of material misstatement in the accompanying \u0234 nancial statements. In particular, we considered where management made subjective judgements; for example, in respect of signi \u0234 cant accounting estimates that involved making assumptions and considering future events that are inherently uncertain. As in all of our audits, we also addressed the risk of management override of internal controls, including, among other matters, consideration of whether there was evidence of bias that represented a risk of material misstatement due to fraud.\n\n## Materiality\n\nThe scope of our audit was in \u0235 uenced by our application of materiality. An audit is designed to obtain reasonable assurance as to whether the consolidated \u0234 nancial statements are free from material misstatement. Misstatements may arise due to fraud or error. They are considered material if, individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to in \u0235 uence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the consolidated \u0234 nancial statements.\n\nBased on our professional judgement, we determined certain quantitative thresholds for materiality, including the overall group materiality for the consolidated \u0234 nancial statements as a whole, as set out in the table below. These, together with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures and to evaluate the e \u038d ect of misstatements, both individually and on the \u0234 nancial statements as a whole.\n\n| How we determined overall Group materiality   | 5% of the Group's pro \u0234  t before tax                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n|-----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Rationale for benchmark applied               | \u00b7  We chose 'pro \u0234  t before tax' as, in our view, it is the benchmark against  which performance of the Group is most commonly measured.  \u00b7  We selected 5% based on our professional judgement, noting that it is  also within the range of commonly accepted pro \u0234  t-related thresholds. |\n\nIn performing our audit, we allocated materiality levels to the signi \u0234 cant components and other components of the Group. These are less than the overall Group materiality.",

The Group's \u0234 nancial reporting process is dependent on its Information Technology ('IT') systems. Our audit scope included testing the operating e \u038d ectiveness of the controls over the integrity of key \u0234 nancial data processed through the IT systems that are relevant to \u0234 nancial reporting.\n\nIn establishing the overall Group audit approach, we determined the extent of audit procedures that were needed to be performed across the Group by us or by other PwC network \u0234 rms, operating under our instruction, who are familiar with the local laws and regulations in each respective territory, (the 'component auditors'). Where the work was performed by component auditors, we determined the level of involvement we needed to have in the procedures to be able to conclude whether su \u025d cient and appropriate audit evidence had been obtained as a basis for our opinion on the \u0234 nancial statements as a whole.\n\n## Key audit matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most signi \u0234 cance in our audit of the \u0234 nancial statements for the \u0234 nancial year ended 31 December 2023.

        "page_content": "## Key audit matter\n\n## How our audit addressed the key audit matter\n\n## Valuation of \u0234 nancial instruments held at fair value\n\nFinancial instruments held by the Group at fair value include derivative assets and liabilities, trading securities, certain debt instruments and other assets and liabilities designated at fair value.\n\nThe Group's \u0234 nancial instruments are predominantly valued using quoted market prices ('Level 1') or market observable prices ('Level 2'). The valuations of 'Level 3' instruments rely on signi \u0234 cant unobservable inputs.\n\nWe considered the overall valuation of \u0234 nancial instruments (Level 1, 2 and 3) to be a key audit matter given the \u0234 nancial signi \u0234 cance to the Group, the nature of the underlying products and the estimation involved to determine fair value.\n\nIn determining fair value, management also make adjustments to recognise credit risk, funding costs, bid-o \u038d er spreads and, in some cases, parameter and model risk limitations. This is broadly consistent with the banking industry, albeit the methodology to calculate some of these adjustments is continuing to evolve.\n\n(Refer also to Notes 3 and 41 to the \u0234 nancial statements.)\n\nWe assessed the design and tested the operating e \u038d ectiveness of the controls over the Group's \u0234 nancial instruments valuation processes. These b included the controls over:\n\n- \u00b7 management's testing and approval of new models and revalidation of existing models;\n- \u00b7 the completeness and accuracy of pricing data inputs into valuation models;\n- \u00b7 monitoring of collateral disputes; and\n- \u00b7 governance mechanisms and monitoring over the valuation processes (including derivative valuation adjustments) by the Group Market and Liquidity Risk Committee and the Group Valuation Committee.\n\nWe determined that we could rely on the controls for the purposes of our b audit.\n\nIn addition, we:\n\n- \u00b7 engaged our own specialists to use their models and input sources to determine an independent estimate of fair value for a sample of the Group's Level 1 and Level 2 \u0234 nancial instruments. We compared these to the Group's calculations of fair value to assess individual material valuation di \u038d erences or systemic bias;\n- \u00b7 assessed the reasonableness of methodologies used and assumptions made for a sample of \u0234 nancial instrument valuations with signi \u0234 cant unobservable valuation inputs (Level 3 instruments);\n- \u00b7 performed procedures on collateral disputes to identify possible indicators of inappropriate valuations;\n- \u00b7 performed tests of inputs and assessed the methodology over fair value adjustments, in light of available market data and industry trends; and\n- \u00b7 considered the implications of global reforms to Interest Reference Rates in our assessment of fair value.\n\nOverall, we considered that the valuation of \u0234 nancial instruments held at fair value was within a reasonable range of outcomes.\n\n## Other Information\n\nManagement is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the Directors' Statement (but does not include the \u0234 nancial statements and our auditor's report thereon), which we obtained prior to the date of this auditor's report, and the other sections of b the annual report ('the Other Sections') which are expected to be made available to us after that date.\n\nOur opinion on the \u0234 nancial statements does not cover the other information and we do not and will not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nIn connection with our audit of the \u0234 nancial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information identi \u0234 ed above and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the \u0234 nancial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.\n\nIf, based on the work we have performed on the other information that we obtained prior to the date of this auditor's report, we conclude that b there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.\n\nWhen we read the Other Sections, if we conclude that there is a material misstatement therein, we are required to communicate the matter to b those charged with governance and take appropriate actions in accordance with SSAs.\n\n## Responsibilities of Management and Directors for the Financial Statements\n\nManagement is responsible for the preparation of \u0234 nancial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with the provisions of the Act and SFRS(I)s, and for devising and maintaining a system of internal accounting controls su \u025d cient to provide a reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded against loss from unauthorised use or disposition; and transactions are properly authorised and that they are recorded as necessary to permit the preparation of true and fair \u0234 nancial statements and to maintain accountability of assets.\n\nIn preparing the \u0234 nancial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Group's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\nThe directors' responsibilities include overseeing the Group's \u0234 nancial reporting process.\n\n## Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the \u0234 nancial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but b is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SSAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to in \u0235 uence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these \u0234 nancial statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with SSAs, we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We b also:\n\n- \u00b7 Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the \u0234 nancial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is su \u025d cient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- \u00b7 Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the e \u038d ectiveness of the Group's internal control.\n- \u00b7 Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by b management.\n- \u00b7 Conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast signi \u0234 cant doubt on the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the \u0234 nancial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.\n- \u00b7 Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the \u0234 nancial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the \u0234 nancial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n- \u00b7 Obtain su \u025d cient appropriate audit evidence regarding the \u0234 nancial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated \u0234 nancial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.\n\nWe communicate with the directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and signi \u0234 cant audit \u0234 ndings, including any signi \u0234 cant de \u0234 ciencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.\n\nWe also provide the directors with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with the directors, we determine those matters that were of most signi \u0234 cance in the audit of the \u0234 nancial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest bene \u0234 ts of such communication.\n\n## Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements\n\nIn our opinion, the accounting and other records required by the Act to be kept by the Company and by those subsidiary corporations incorporated in Singapore of which we are the auditors have been properly kept in accordance with the provisions of the Act.\n\nThe engagement partner on the audit resulting in this independent auditor's report is Yura Mahindroo.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\n\nPublic Accountants and Chartered Accountants\n\nSingapore, 6 February 2024",

Domicile and Activities\n\nThe Company, DBS Group Holdings Ltd, is incorporated and domiciled in the Republic of Singapore and has its registered o \u025d ce at 12 Marina Boulevard, Marina Bay Financial Centre Tower Three, Singapore 018982.\n\nThe Company is listed on the Singapore Exchange.\n\nThe Company is an investment holding, treasury and funding vehicle for the group. Its main subsidiary is DBS Bank Ltd. (the Bank), which is wholly owned and engaged in a range of commercial banking and \u0234 nancial services, principally in Asia.\n\nThe \u0234 nancial statements relate to the Company and its subsidiaries (the Group) and the Group's interests in associates and joint ventures.\n\n## 2. Summary of Material Accounting Policies\n\n## 2.1 Basis of preparation\n\n## Compliance with Singapore Financial Reporting Standards (International) (SFRS(I))\n\nThe \u0234 nancial statements of the Company and the consolidated \u0234 nancial statements of the Group are prepared in accordance with Singapore Financial Reporting Standards (International) (SFRS(I)). As permitted by Section 201(10)(b) of the Companies Act 1967 (the Act), the Company's income statement has not been included in these \u0234 nancial statements.\n\nThe \u0234 nancial statements are presented in Singapore dollars and rounded to the nearest million, unless otherwise stated.\n\n## 2.2 Signi \u0234 cant estimates and judgement\n\nThe preparation of \u0234 nancial statements requires management to exercise judgement, use estimates and make assumptions in the application of policies and in reporting the amounts in the \u0234 nancial statements. Although these estimates are based on management's best knowledge of current events and actions, actual results may di \u038d er from these estimates. Critical accounting estimates and assumptions used that are signi \u0234 cant to the \u0234 nancial statements, and areas involving a higher degree of judgement and complexity, are b disclosed in Note 3.\n\n## 2.3 New or amended SFRS(I) e \u038d ective for 2023 year-end\n\nThe Group has adopted International Tax Reform - Pillar Two Model Rules (Amendments to SFRS(I) 1-12) upon its issuance in May 2023. The amendments provide a temporary mandatory exception from deferred tax accounting arising from the implementation of Pillar Two model rules which is e \u038d ective immediately, and also require new b disclosures on the Pillar Two exposure.\n\nThe other amendments to SFRS(I) that were e \u038d ective from 1 January 2023 did not have a signi \u0234 cant impact on the Group's \u0234 nancial statements.\n\n## 2.4 New SFRS(I) and Interpretations e \u038d ective for future periods\n\nThe amendments and interpretations e \u038d ective for future periods do b not have a signi \u0234 cant impact on the Group's \u0234 nancial statements.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nA)\n\n## General Accounting Policies\n\nA summary of the Group's material accounting policies is described further below starting with those relating to the entire \u0234 nancial statements, followed by those relating to the income statement, the b balance sheet and other speci \u0234 c topics. This does not re \u0235 ect the b relative importance of these policies to the Group.\n\n## 2.5 Group Accounting\n\n## Subsidiaries\n\nSubsidiaries are entities (including structured entities) over which the b Group has control. The Group controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to a \u038d ect those returns through its power over the entity.\n\nSubsidiaries are consolidated from the date control is transferred to b the Group to the date control ceases.\n\nThe acquisition method is used to account for business combinations. Please refer to Note 2.13 for the Group's accounting policy on goodwill.\n\nAll intra-group transactions and balances are eliminated on consolidation.\n\n## Associates and Joint Ventures\n\nAssociates are entities over which the Group has signi \u0234 cant in \u0235 uence but no control, where the Group generally holds a shareholding of between and including 20% and 50% of the voting rights.\n\nJoint ventures are entities which the Group has joint control and rights to the net assets of the entity.\n\nInvestments in associates and joint ventures are initially recognised at cost. In addition, when the Group's share of the fair value of the identi \u0234 able net assets of the investment exceeds the cost of acquisition paid by the Group, the excess is recognised in pro \u0234 t and loss as part of the share of pro \u0234 t from associates and joint ventures.\n\nInvestments in associates and joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method. Under the equity method of accounting, these investments are initially recognised at cost and adjusted thereafter to recognise the Group's share of post-acquisition pro \u0234 ts or losses and the Group's share of other comprehensive income. Dividends received or receivable from the associates and joint ventures are recognised as a reduction of the carrying amount of the investments.\n\n## 2.6 Foreign currency treatment\n\n## Functional and presentation currency\n\nItems in the \u0234 nancial statements are measured using the functional currency of each entity in the Group, this being the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates. The Group's \u0234 nancial statements are presented in Singapore dollars, which is the functional currency of the Company.\n\n## Foreign currency transactions and balances\n\nTransactions in foreign currencies are measured using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.\n\nMonetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency of the entity undertaking the transaction at the exchange rates at the balance sheet date. Foreign exchange di \u038d erences arising from this translation are recognised in the income statement within 'Net trading income'.\n\nNon-monetary assets and liabilities measured at cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the date of the transaction.\n\nNon-monetary assets and liabilities measured at fair values in foreign currencies are translated using the exchange rates at the date when the fair values are determined, which is generally the balance sheet date.\n\nUnrealised foreign exchange di \u038d erences arising from non-monetary \u0234 nancial assets and liabilities classi \u0234 ed as fair value through pro \u0234 t or loss (FVPL) are recognised in the income statement as trading income.\n\nNon-monetary \u0234 nancial assets that are classi \u0234 ed at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) relates mainly to FVOCI equities. Please refer to Note 2.9 for the accounting treatment of FVOCI equities.\n\n## Foreign operations\n\nThe results and \u0234 nancial position of subsidiaries, associates, joint ventures and branches or units whose functional currency is not Singapore dollars ('foreign operations') are translated into Singapore dollars in the following manner:\n\n- \u00b7 Assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rates at the balance sheet date;\n- \u00b7 Income and expenses in the income statement are translated at exchange rates prevailing at each month-end, approximating the exchange rates at the dates of the transactions; and\n- \u00b7 All resulting exchange di \u038d erences are recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated under foreign currency translation reserves in equity. When a foreign operation is partially or fully disposed of, or when it is liquidated, such exchange di \u038d erences are recognised in the income statement as part of the gain or loss.\n\nFor acquisitions prior to 1 January 2005, the foreign exchange rates at the respective dates of acquisition were used. Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign operation on or after 1 January 2005 are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign operation and translated at the closing rate. Please refer to Note 27 for an overview of goodwill recorded.\n\n## 2.7 Segment reporting\n\nOperating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to management.\n\nIn preparing the segment information, amounts for each business segment are shown after the allocation of certain centralised costs, funding income and the application of transfer pricing, where appropriate. Transactions between segments are recorded within the segment as if they are third party transactions and are eliminated on consolidation.\n\nPlease refer to Note 45 for further details on business and geographical segment reporting.",

The calculation includes signi \u0234 cant fees and transaction costs that are integral to the e \u038d ective interest rate, as well as premiums or discounts.\n\nNet interest income also includes the interest element of derivative instruments that are (i) designated in hedge accounting relationships (Note 2.19) or (ii) used in funding or other hedging arrangements where this treatment would reduce an accounting mismatch.\n\n## Fee and commission income\n\nThe Group earns fee and commission income from a diverse range of products and services provided to its customers. Fee and commission income are recognised when the Group has satis \u0234 ed its performance obligation in providing the promised products and services to the customer, and are recognised based on contractual rates agreed with customers, net of expected waivers based on historical experience, and net of expenses directly related to it. The Group generally satis \u0234 es its performance obligation and recognises the fee and commission income on the following basis:\n\n- \u00b7 Transaction-based fee and commission income is recognised on the completion of the transaction. Such fees include underwriting fees, brokerage fees, bancassurance sales commission and variable service fees, and fees related to the completion of corporate \u0234 nance transactions.\n- \u00b7 For a service that is provided over a period of time, fee and commission income is generally recognised on equal proportion basis over the period during which the related service is provided or credit risk is undertaken. This basis of recognition most appropriately re \u0235 ects the nature and pattern of provision of these services to the customers over time. Fees for these services can be billed to customers in advance or periodically over time. Such fees include the income from issuance of \u0234 nancial guarantees and b bancassurance \u0234 xed service fees.\n\nThe Group does not provide any signi \u0234 cant credit terms to customers for the above products and services. Directly related expenses typically include brokerage fees paid, card-related expenses and sales commissions, but do not include expenses for services delivered over a period (such as service contracts) and other expenses that are not speci \u0234 cally related to fee b and commission income transactions.\n\n## Dividend income\n\nDividend income is recognised when the right to receive payment is established. Dividend income arising from \u0234 nancial assets classi \u0234 ed as b FVPL is recognised in 'Net trading income', while those arising from FVOCI \u0234 nancial assets is recognised in 'Net b income from investment securities'.\n\n## Allowances for credit and other losses\n\nPlease refer to Note 2.11 for the accounting policy on impairment of b \u0234 nancial assets.\n\nC)\n\n## Balance Sheet\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 2.9 Financial assets\n\n## Initial recognition\n\nPurchases and sales of all \u0234 nancial assets are recognised on the date that the Group enters into the contractual arrangements with counterparties. When the Group acts as a trustee or in a \u0234 duciary capacity for assets it does not directly control or bene \u0234 t from, the assets and the corresponding income belonging to a customer are excluded from the \u0234 nancial statements.\n\nFinancial assets are initially recognised at fair value, which is generally the transaction price.\n\n## Classi \u0234 cation and subsequent measurement\n\nSFRS(I) 9 categorises debt-like \u0234 nancial assets based on the business model within which the assets are managed, and whether the assets constitute a 'basic lending arrangement' where their contractual cash \u0235 ows represent solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI). Interest is de \u0234 ned as consideration for the time value of money, credit risk, other basic lending risks and may include a pro \u0234 t margin.\n\nThe classi \u0234 cation of the \u0234 nancial assets and the associated accounting treatment are as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Debt instruments are measured at amortised cost when they are in a 'hold to collect' (HTC) business model and have contractual cash \u0235 ows that are SPPI in nature. The objective of a HTC business model is to collect contractual principal and interest cash \u0235 ows. Sales are incidental to the objective and expected to be either insigni \u0234 cant or infrequent. These assets consist primarily of loans in the 'Consumer Banking/ Wealth Management' and 'Institutional Banking' segments as well as debt securities from the 'Others' segment.\n- \u00b7 Debt instruments are measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) when they are in a 'hold to collect & sell' (HTC & S) business model and have cash \u0235 ows that are SPPI in nature. Both the collection of contractual cash \u0235 ows and sales are integral to achieving the objective of the HTC & S business model. Assets measured at FVOCI comprise mainly of debt securities from 'Treasury Markets' and the 'Others' segment.\n\nUnrealised gains or losses on FVOCI debt instruments are recorded in other comprehensive income and accumulated in FVOCI revaluation reserves. When they are sold, the accumulated fair value adjustments in FVOCI revaluation reserves are reclassi \u0234 ed to the income statement as 'Net income from investment securities'.\n\n- \u00b7 Debt instruments are measured at fair value through pro \u0234 t or b loss (FVPL) when:\n- i) the assets are not SPPI in nature;\n- ii)  the assets are not part of a 'HTC' or 'HTC & S' business model; or\n- iii)  the assets are designated at FVPL to eliminate or signi \u0234 cantly reduce the measurement or recognition inconsistencies that would otherwise arise from measuring assets or liabilities on di \u038d erent bases.\n\nAssets measured at FVPL are mainly recorded in the 'Treasury Markets' segment. Realised and unrealised gains or losses on FVPL \u0234 nancial assets are taken to the income statement in the period they arise.\n\n- \u00b7 Subsequent changes in fair value of non-trading equity instruments can be taken through pro \u0234 t or loss or comprehensive income, as elected. The Group generally elects its non-trading equity instruments to be classi \u0234 ed as FVOCI. Other than dividend income, gains and losses on FVOCI equity instruments are recorded in other comprehensive income and accumulated in FVOCI revaluation reserves, and not reclassi \u0234 ed to pro \u0234 t or loss upon derecognition.\n- \u00b7 Derivatives (including derivatives embedded in \u0234 nancial liabilities but separated for accounting purposes) are classi \u0234 ed as held for trading unless they are designated in hedge accounting relationships (Note 2.19). Derivatives are classi \u0234 ed as assets when the fair value is positive and as liabilities when the fair value is negative. Changes in the fair value of derivatives other than those designated as hedging instruments in cash \u0235 ow or net investment hedges are included in 'Net trading income'. Also refer to Note 2.8 on the accounting for the b interest element of derivative instruments.\n\n## Reclassi \u0234 cation\n\nReclassi \u0234 cation of \u0234 nancial assets are prohibited unless the Group changes its business model for managing \u0234 nancial assets. In practice, this is expected to be infrequent.\n\n## Determination of fair value\n\nThe fair value of \u0234 nancial assets is the price that would be received if the asset is sold in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Fair value is generally estimated by using prices in active markets or by using valuation techniques that use observable market parameters as inputs.\n\nWhere applicable, a valuation reserve or pricing adjustment is applied to arrive at the fair value. Signi \u0234 cant judgement is required in b estimating fair value. Refer to Note 41 for further details.\n\n## O \u038d setting\n\nFinancial assets and liabilities are presented net when there is a legally enforceable right to o \u038d set the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle them on a net basis, or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.\n\n## Derecognition\n\nFinancial assets are derecognised when the rights to receive cash \u0235 ows from the \u0234 nancial assets have expired or when they have been transferred together with substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership.\n\nThe Group enters into certain transactions where it transfers \u0234 nancial assets recognised on its balance sheet but retains either all or a portion of the risks and rewards of the transferred \u0234 nancial assets. In such cases, the transferred \u0234 nancial assets are not derecognised from the balance sheet. Such transactions include repurchase agreements described in Note 2.12. They also include transactions where control over the \u0234 nancial asset is retained, for example, by a simultaneous transaction (such as options) with the same counterparty to which the asset is transferred. These are mainly transacted in the 'Treasury Markets' segment. In such cases, the Group continues to recognise the asset to the extent of its continuing involvement which is the extent to which it is exposed to b changes in the value of the transferred asset.\n\nPlease refer to Note 19 for disclosures on transferred \u0234 nancial assets.\n\n## 2.10 Cash and cash equivalents\n\nFor the purposes of the cash \u0235 ow statement, cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and non-restricted balances with b central banks which are readily convertible into cash.\n\n## 2.11 Impairment of \u0234 nancial assets at amortised cost and FVOCI\n\n## Expected Credit Losses (ECL)\n\nECL are recognised for all \u0234 nancial assets held at amortised cost, debt instruments measured at FVOCI, guarantees and undrawn credit commitments. It represents the present value of expected cash shortfalls over the residual term of a \u0234 nancial asset, guarantee or undrawn commitment.\n\nAt initial recognition, allowance is required for ECL resulting from possible default events that may occur within the next 12 months ('12-month ECL'). In the event of a signi \u0234 cant increase in credit risk, allowance is required for ECL resulting from possible default events over the expected life of the instrument ('lifetime ECL').\n\nThe ECL recognised follows the three-stage model: \u0234 nancial instruments where 12-month ECL is recognised are considered Stage 1; \u0234 nancial instruments which experience a signi \u0234 cant increase in credit risk (SICR) are in Stage 2; and \u0234 nancial instruments with objective evidence of default or are credit-impaired are in Stage 3.\n\n- \u00b7 Stage 1 - Financial instruments are classi \u0234 ed as Stage 1 at initial recognition and will remain under Stage 1 unless they experience a SICR or become credit-impaired. 12-month ECL is recognised for these instruments.\n- \u00b7 Stage 2 - Financial instruments which experience a SICR subsequent to initial recognition, but are not yet credit-impaired, will migrate from Stage 1 to Stage 2. Lifetime ECL is recognised for these instruments.\n- SICR: SICR is assessed by comparing the risk of default at reporting date to the risk of default at origination using a range of qualitative and quantitative factors.\n\nFor wholesale exposures, a \u0234 nancial instrument is deemed to have experienced a signi \u0234 cant increase in credit risk when:\n\n- \u00b7 the observed change in its probability of default (PD), as observed by downgrades in the Group's internal credit risk rating for this instrument between origination and reporting dates, is more than pre-speci \u0234 ed thresholds; or\n- \u00b7 it is placed on certain internal credit watchlists categories for closer scrutiny of developing credit issues.\n\nFor retail exposures, days past due is the main driver, supplemented with a PD-based criterion. In any event, all retail and wholesale exposures that are more than 30 days past due are presumed to have experienced a signi \u0234 cant increase in credit risk, unless assessed otherwise, and are classi \u0234 ed as Stage 2. b\n\nInstruments in Stage 2 that no longer exhibit a signi \u0234 cant increase in credit risk will be transferred back to Stage 1.",

        "page_content": "- \u00b7 Stage 3 - Financial instruments that become credit-impaired with evidence of default, i.e. non-performing assets, are transferred to Stage 3. Please refer to Risk Management section for the de \u0234 nition of non-performing assets.\n\nLifetime ECL is recognised for these assets. ECL for Stage 3 assets are also known as speci \u0234 c allowances.\n\nA Stage 3 exposure that is restructured can be upgraded to Stage 2 if there are reasonable grounds to conclude that the obligor is able to service future principal and interest payments in accordance with the restructured terms. Stage 3 \u0234 nancial assets are written-o \u038d , in whole or in part, when the Group has exhausted all practical recovery e \u038d orts and has concluded that there is no reasonable expectation of future recoveries.\n\n## Measurement of ECL\n\nECL are unbiased and probability-weighted estimates of credit losses determined by evaluating a range of possible outcomes, considering past events, current conditions and assessments of future economic conditions at the reporting date. The ECL associated with a \u0234 nancial instrument is typically a product of its probability of default (PD), loss given default (LGD) and exposure at default (EAD) discounted using the original e \u038d ective interest rate to the reporting date.\n\n| Component   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n|-------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| PD          | Point-in-time (based on current conditions, adjusted to  take into account estimates of future conditions that will  impact PD) estimate of the likelihood of default.                                                               |\n| LGD         | Estimate of the loss arising on default. It is based on the  di \u038d  erence between the contractual cash  \u0235  ows due and  those that the Group would expect to receive, including  recoveries from collaterals.                        |\n| EAD         | Estimate of the expected credit exposure at time of  default, taking into account repayments of principal  and interest as well as expected drawdowns on  undrawn credit commitments and potential pay-outs  on b guarantees issued. |\n\nThe 12-month ECL is calculated by multiplying the 12-month PD, LGD and EAD. Lifetime ECL is calculated by multiplying the lifetime PD, LGD and EAD. The 12-month and lifetime PDs represent the probability of default occurring over the next 12 months and the remaining maturity of the instrument respectively.\n\nIn most instances, expected remaining maturity is the same as the remaining contractual life which represents the maximum contractual period over which the Group is exposed to the credit risk of the borrower. However, for some revolving products (e.g. credit cards), the expected remaining maturity may exceed the contractual maturity. In b such instances, behavioural expected remaining life will be used.\n\n## ECL Modelling - Point-in-Time and Forward-Looking Adjustments\n\nThe Group leverages the models and parameters implemented under the Basel II Internal Ratings-Based (IRB) framework where possible, with appropriate modi \u0234 cations to meet SFRS(I) 9 requirements.\n\nOther relevant historical information, loss experience or proxies will be utilised for portfolios without appropriate Basel models and parameters, with a view to maximise the use of available information that is reliable and supportable.\n\nFor the wholesale portfolios, credit cycle indices (CCIs) have been developed for the key industries and geographies. CCIs are summary measures that depict broad-based, sector-wide changes in credit risk, which are constructed by comparing the median expected default frequency of \u0234 rms within each segment against a long-run average. Expected default frequency is in turn a market-based point-in-time default risk measure driven by the market value of \u0234 rms' assets, asset volatility and leverage. CCIs are then used as inputs to convert the generally more through-the-cycle PDs derived from Basel models/ parameters into the point-in-time equivalents by adding the unaccounted portion of cyclical variations, as well as to incorporate forward-looking information. LGDs are determined using historical loss data, which are adjusted for both the latest and forecasted recovery experience.\n\nThe Group relies on a Monte Carlo simulation approach to consider over 100 probability-weighted forward-looking scenarios in estimating ECL. This involves simulations of many alternative CCI scenarios to arrive at an unbiased ECL estimate that are meant to cover all possible good and bad scenarios based on known estimates.\n\nFor material unsecured retail portfolios under the Advanced Internal Ratings-Based Approach (Advanced IRBA), the Group has rolled out a SFRS(I) 9 adjusted PD, LGD and EAD-based approach during the year. For other retail portfolios, historical loss experience is used in conjunction with the forecast loss rates which take into account relevant macroeconomic variables, such as property prices and unemployment rates.\n\n## Expert credit judgement and post model adjustments\n\nThe measurement of ECL requires the application of expert credit judgement and post model adjustments. These include:\n\n- \u00b7 assignment of credit risk ratings and determination of whether exposures should be placed on credit watchlists;\n- \u00b7 assessment of whether a signi \u0234 cant increase in credit risk has occurred;\n- \u00b7 selecting and calibrating the ECL models such as CCIs;\n- \u00b7 determining the expected remaining maturity of revolving products (e.g. overdrafts and credit cards);\n- \u00b7 determination of the forecast loss rates; and\n- \u00b7 application of thematic overlays based on emerging risk themes where potential risks may not be fully captured in the underlying modelled ECL. Such top-down additional modelled ECL was quanti \u0234 ed by means of applying conditional probabilities on more severe scenarios materialising from emerging risk themes.\n\nThe Group has the following thematic overlays as at 31 December 2023.\n\nIn addition to the base scenarios generated by the model, the Group has incorporated stress scenarios and assigned probabilities to the scenarios, in line with management's judgement of the likelihood of each scenario. The stress scenarios factor in heightened geopolitical and macro-economic risk, potential vulnerabilities in the US and EU corporates, as well as stress in the China commercial real estate sector.\n\nThere is also a thematic overlay to address pricing pressures and risks of asset stranding that the conventional energy sector could face as a result of a transition to a low-carbon economy. Probabilities were assigned to the scenarios in-line with management's judgement of the likelihood of each scenario.\n\n## Governance framework\n\nThe measurement of ECL is subject to a robust governance framework as described below.\n\n- \u00b7 The Group ECL Review Committee (Review Committee) is the overarching committee for ECL related matters and comprises senior management and representatives from functions across the Group. Signi \u0234 cant changes to ECL models and methodologies and the application of thematic overlays are subject to the oversight and approval of the Review Committee.\n- \u00b7 The Review Committee is supported by the Group ECL Operating Committee (Operating Committee) which comprises cross functional representatives and subject matter experts. The Operating Committee recommends changes to ECL models, methodologies and thematic overlays to the Review Committee; provides oversight over system design, infrastructure and development; and establishes principles and signi \u0234 cant policies pertaining to ECL. Group Credit Risk Models Committee oversees ECL models and credit risk models used by the Group.\n- \u00b7 Location ECL committees are established for key overseas subsidiaries to govern and manage location-speci \u0234 c ECL reporting.\n- \u00b7 ECL models are subject to independent validation by the Risk Management Group (RMG) Model Validation team, as well as independent reviews by internal and external auditors. The validation and assurance processes cover the review of the underlying ECL methodology including its logic and conceptual b soundness.\n\n## Minimum Regulatory Loss Allowance\n\nSingapore banks are required to maintain the Minimum Regulatory Loss Allowances (MRLA) of at least 1% of the gross carrying amount of selected credit exposures net of collaterals per MAS Notice 612. For periods when Stage 1 and 2 ECL fall below MRLA, the shortfall is appropriated from retained earnings in the shareholders' funds into a non-distributable Regulatory Loss Allowance Reserve (RLAR) account.\n\n## 2.12 Repurchase agreements\n\nRepurchase agreements (Repos) are arrangements where the Group sold the securities but are subject to a commitment to repurchase or redeem the securities at a pre-determined price. The securities are retained on the balance sheet as the Group retains substantially all the risk and rewards of ownership and these securities are disclosed within 'Financial assets pledged or transferred' (Note 19). The consideration received is recorded as \u0234 nancial liabilities in either 'Due to banks' or 'Deposits and balances from customers'. Short-dated repos transacted as part of Treasury Markets activities are measured at FVPL. b\n\n## Reverse repurchase agreements (Reverse repos) are\n\narrangements where the Group purchased the securities but are subject to a commitment to resell or return the securities at a predetermined price. b The risk and rewards of ownership of the collateral are not acquired by the Group and are re \u0235 ected as collateral received and recorded o \u038d -balance sheet. The consideration paid is recorded as \u0234 nancial assets as 'Cash and balances with central banks', 'Due from banks' or 'Loans and advances to customers'. Short-dated reverse repos transacted as part of Treasury Markets activities are measured at FVPL.\n\n## 2.13 Goodwill and intangible assets arising from business combinations\n\n## Goodwill\n\nGoodwill arising from business combinations generally represents the excess of the acquisition cost over the fair value of identi \u0234 able assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed on the acquisition date. Goodwill is stated at cost less impairment losses and is tested at least annually for impairment.\n\nAt the acquisition date, any goodwill acquired is allocated to each of the cash-generating units (CGU) or group of CGUs expected to bene \u0234 t from the combination's synergies.\n\nAn impairment loss is recognised on goodwill when the carrying amount of a CGU, or group of CGUs, including the goodwill, exceeds the applicable recoverable amount. The recoverable amount of a CGU or CGU group is the higher of the CGU's or CGU group's fair value less cost to sell and its value-in-use. An impairment loss on goodwill is recognised in the income statement and cannot be reversed in subsequent periods.\n\n## Other intangible assets\n\nIntangible assets acquired in a business combination are recognised at fair value at the acquisition date and they relate mainly to customer relationships and core customer deposits. They have a \u0234 nite useful life and are subsequently measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. b Intangible assets are amortised using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives of 10 years.\n\n## 2.14 Properties and other \u0234 xed assets\n\n## Owned properties and other \u0234 xed assets\n\nProperties (including investment properties) and other \u0234 xed assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.\n\nDepreciation is calculated using the straight-line method to write down the costs of the assets to their residual values over the estimated useful lives of the assets. The useful life refers to the period which the Group expects to use or hold the asset.\n\nThe residual value of an asset is its estimated selling price (after deducting related costs), assuming that it is already at the age and in the condition expected at the end of its useful life. No depreciation is recognised when the residual value is higher than the carrying amount.\n\nFreehold and leasehold land with unexpired lease terms of more than 100 years are not depreciated. The depreciation periods of the other assets are as follows:\n\n| Leasehold land with  unexpired lease terms                         | The shorter of the remaining lease term or useful life            |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| below 100 years                                                    |                                                                   |\n| Buildings                                                          | The shorter of 50 years, the remaining  lease term or useful life |\n| Computer software                                                  | 3 to 5 years                                                      |\n| Computer hardware,   o \u025d   ce equipment,  furniture and  \u0234  ttings | 3 to 10 years                                                     |\n\nLeasehold improvements\n\nUp to 20 years\n\n## Leased properties and other \u0234 xed assets\n\nLease liabilities are initially measured at the present value of lease payments to be made over the lease term at the lease commencement date. The measurement of the associated right-ofuse assets generally approximates the lease liability.\n\nLease liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the e \u038d ective interest method. The right-of-use assets are depreciated over the lease term on a straight-line basis.\n\nExtension options and termination options are included in the assessment of the lease term if the options are reasonably certain to b be exercised or not exercised accordingly. If the Group changes its b initial assessment, adjustments are made to the carrying amounts of the lease liabilities and right-of-use assets prospectively.\n\nThe recognition exceptions for short-term leases and leases of lowvalue assets are applied.",

The Group generally classi \u0234 es and measures its \u0234 nancial liabilities in accordance with the purpose for which the \u0234 nancial liabilities are incurred and managed. Accordingly:\n\n- \u00b7 Financial liabilities are classi \u0234 ed as \u0234 nancial liabilities at fair value through pro \u0234 t or loss if they are incurred for the purpose of repurchasing in the near term ( 'held for trading' ), and this may include debt securities issued and short positions in securities for the purpose of ongoing market-making or trading. Financial liabilities at fair value through pro \u0234 t or loss can also be designated by management on initial recognition ( 'designated at fair value through pro \u0234 t or loss' ) if doing so eliminates or signi \u0234 cantly reduces measurement or recognition inconsistencies that would otherwise arise, or if the \u0234 nancial liability contains an embedded derivative that would otherwise need to be separately recorded, or if a group of \u0234 nancial liabilities or \u0234 nancial assets and \u0234 nancial liabilities is managed and its performance is evaluated on a fair value basis. Financial liabilities in this classi \u0234 cation are usually within the 'Treasury Markets' segment.\n\nRealised or unrealised gains or losses on \u0234 nancial liabilities held for trading and \u0234 nancial liabilities designated under the fair value option, except interest expense, are taken to 'Net trading income' in the income statement in the period they arise.\n\nThe changes to the fair value of \u0234 nancial liabilities designated under the fair value option that are attributable to the Group's own credit risk are taken to revenue reserves through other comprehensive income. These amounts are not transferred to the b income statement even when realised.\n\n- \u00b7 Derivative liabilities are treated consistently with derivative assets. Please refer to Note 2.9 for the accounting policy on derivatives.\n- \u00b7 Other \u0234 nancial liabilities are carried at amortised cost using the e \u038d ective interest method. These comprise predominantly the Group's 'Deposits and balances from customers', 'Due to banks' and 'Other debt securities'.\n\nPlease refer to Note 14 for further details on the types of \u0234 nancial liabilities classi \u0234 ed and measured as above.\n\n## Determination of fair value\n\nThe fair value of \u0234 nancial liabilities is the price that would be paid to transfer the liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.\n\nPlease refer to Note 41 for further fair value disclosures.\n\n## Derecognition\n\nA \u0234 nancial liability is derecognised from the balance sheet when the obligation speci \u0234 ed in the contract is discharged, cancelled or b expired.\n\n## 2.16 Loan commitments, letters of credit and \u0234 nancial b guarantees\n\n## Loan commitments\n\nLoan commitments are not recognised on the balance sheet and are disclosed in Note 35. Upon a loan draw-down, the amount of the loan is generally recognised as 'Loans and advances to customers' on the Group's balance sheet.\n\n## Letters of credit\n\nLetters of credit are recorded o \u038d -balance sheet as contingent liabilities upon issuance, and the corresponding payables to the bene \u0234 ciaries and receivables from the applicants are recognised on the balance sheet upon acceptance of the underlying documents.\n\n## Financial guarantees\n\nFinancial guarantees are initially recognised in the \u0234 nancial statements at fair value on the date the guarantees are given.\n\nFinancial guarantees are subsequently measured at the higher of:\n\n- \u00b7 the amount of the ECL (Note 2.11); and\n- \u00b7 the unamortised portion of the fees that were received on initial b recognition.\n\nPlease refer to Note 2.8 for the principles for recognising the fees.\n\nO \u038d -balance sheet credit exposures are managed for credit risk in the b same manner as \u0234 nancial assets.\n\nPlease refer to Note 2.11 on the Group's accounting policies on allowances for credit losses.\n\n## 2.17 Provisions\n\nProvisions are liabilities of uncertain timing or amounts and are recognised when:\n\n- \u00b7 the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events;\n- \u00b7 it is probable that an out \u0235 ow of resources embodying economic bene \u0234 ts will be required to settle the obligation; and\n- \u00b7 a reliable estimate of the amount of the obligation can be made.\n\nThe amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation at the balance sheet date.\n\n## 2.18 Share capital and other instruments classi \u0234 ed as b equity\n\nOrdinary shares, preference shares and other instruments which do not result in the Group having a contractual obligation to deliver cash or another \u0234 nancial asset, or to exchange \u0234 nancial assets or \u0234 nancial liabilities with the holder under conditions that are potentially unfavourable to the Group, are classi \u0234 ed as equity. b Distributions arising from such instruments are recognised in equity as there is no contractual obligation to pay distributions on these instruments. Incremental external costs directly attributable to the issuance of such instruments are accounted for as a deduction from equity.\n\nWhen any entity within the Group purchases the Company's ordinary shares ('treasury shares'), the consideration paid, including any directly attributable incremental cost is presented as a component within equity, until they are cancelled, sold or reissued.\n\nWhen treasury shares are subsequently cancelled, the cost of the treasury shares is deducted against either the share capital account or retained earnings. When treasury shares are subsequently sold or reissued, any realised gain or loss on sale or reissue, net of any directly attributable incremental transaction costs and related income tax, is recognised in other reserves.\n\nFor ordinary and preference shares, interim dividends are recorded during the \u0234 nancial year in which they are declared payable. Final dividends are recorded during the \u0234 nancial year in which the dividends are approved by the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## D) Other Speci \u0234 c Topics\n\n## 2.19 Hedge accounting\n\nAs part of the overall risk management of the Group, derivatives and other instruments are used to manage exposures to interest rate and foreign currency risks, including exposures arising from forecast transactions. Where all relevant criteria are met, the Group can elect to apply hedge accounting to reduce the accounting mismatch between hedging instrument and the hedged item.\n\nTo qualify for hedge accounting, at the inception of each hedging relationship, the Group designates and documents the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item; the risk management objective for undertaking the hedge transaction; and the methods used to assess the e \u038d ectiveness of the hedge. At b inception and on an on-going basis, the Group also assesses and measures the e \u038d ectiveness of the hedging relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item.\n\nThe Group designates certain derivatives as hedging instruments in respect of foreign currency risk and interest rate risk in fair value hedges, cash \u0235 ow hedges, or hedges of net investments in foreign operations as described below.\n\n## \u00b7 Fair value hedge\n\nFor a qualifying fair value hedge, the changes in the fair value of the hedging instruments are recorded in the income statement, together with any changes in the fair value of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk. If the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, the adjustment on the hedged item is amortised using the e \u038d ective interest method to the income statement over its remaining maturity.\n\nHowever, where the hedged item is an equity instrument classi \u0234 ed as FVOCI, changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument and the hedged item are both recorded in other comprehensive income and accumulated in FVOCI revaluation reserves. The amounts recorded in FVOCI revaluation reserves are not subsequently reclassi \u0234 ed to the income statement.\n\n## \u00b7 Cash \u0235 ow hedge\n\nFor qualifying cash \u0235 ow hedges, the e \u038d ective portion of changes in b the fair value of derivatives is recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated under the cash \u0235 ow hedge reserves in equity. This amount is reclassi \u0234 ed to the income statement in the periods when the hedged forecast cash \u0235 ows a \u038d ect the income statement. The ine \u038d ective portion of the gain or loss is recognised immediately in the income statement under 'Net trading income'.\n\nWhen a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss existing in the cash \u0235 ow hedge reserves remains until the forecast transaction is recognised in the income statement. When a b forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss in the cash \u0235 ow hedge reserves is immediately reclassi \u0234 ed from equity to the income statement.\n\n## \u00b7 Net investment hedge\n\nHedges of net investments in the Group's foreign operations are accounted for in a manner similar to cash \u0235 ow hedges.\n\nOn b disposal of the foreign operations, the cumulative gain or loss in the foreign currency translation reserves is reclassi \u0234 ed to the income statement as part of the gain or loss on disposal.\n\nWhen designating the hedging instrument, the Group may elect to exclude the valuation components of currency basis spreads and forward points from the hedge relationship on a hedge-by-hedge basis.\n\nThe forward points and currency basis spreads which are excluded and recorded in other comprehensive income are:\n\n- \u00b7 reclassi \u0234 ed to the income statement when the forecast transaction occurs; or\n- \u00b7 amortised to the income statement over the hedging tenor for time-period hedges. The amounts recorded in other comprehensive income are not subsequently reclassi \u0234 ed to the b income statement for hedges of FVOCI equities.\n\nThe Group has elected to apply the SFRS(I) 9 hedge accounting rules b in full.\n\nPlease refer to Note 38 for further details relating to hedge accounting, including fair value, cash \u0235 ow and net investment hedges.\n\n## 2.20 Employee bene \u0234 ts\n\nEmployee bene \u0234 ts, which include base pay, cash bonuses, sharebased compensation, contribution to de \u0234 ned contribution plans such as the Central Provident Fund and other sta \u038d -related allowances, are recognised in the income statement when incurred.\n\nFor de \u0234 ned contribution plans, contributions are made to publicly or privately administered funds on a mandatory, contractual or voluntary basis. Once the contributions have been paid, the Group has no further payment obligations.\n\nEmployee entitlement to annual leave is recognised when they accrue to employees. A provision is made for the estimated liability for annual unutilised leave as a result of services rendered by employees up to the balance sheet date.\n\n## 2.21 Share-based compensation\n\nEmployee bene \u0234 ts also include share-based compensation, namely the DBSH Share Plan, the DBSH Employee Share Plan and the DBSH Employee Share Purchase Plan (the Plans). The details of the Plans are described in Note 39.\n\nEquity instruments granted and ultimately vested under the Plans are recognised in the income statement based on the fair value of the equity instruments at the date of grant. The expense is amortised over the vesting period of each award, with a corresponding adjustment to the share plan reserves.\n\nA trust has been set up for the DBSH Employee Share Purchase Plan. The employer's share of the trust fund is consolidated. The unvested DBSH shares held by the trust funds are accounted for as treasury shares, which is presented as a deduction within equity.",

        "page_content": "## 2.22 Current and deferred taxes\n\nCurrent income tax for current and prior periods is recognised as the amount expected to be paid or recovered from the tax authorities, using the tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. The Group considers uncertain tax positions generally at the level of the total tax liability to each tax authority for each period. The liability is determined based on the total amount of current tax expected to be paid, taking into account all tax uncertainties, using either an expected value approach or a single best estimate of the most likely outcome.\n\nTax assets and liabilities of the same type (current or deferred) are o \u038d set when a legal right of o \u038d set exists and settlement in this manner is intended. This applies generally when they arise from the same tax reporting group and relate to the same tax authority.\n\nDeferred income tax is provided on temporary di \u038d erences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the \u0234 nancial statements. However, deferred tax liabilities are not recognised if they arise from the initial recognition of goodwill. Deferred income tax is also not accounted for if it arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that, at the time of the transaction, a \u038d ects neither accounting nor taxable pro \u0234 t or loss and does not give rise to equal taxable and deductible temporary di \u038d erences. The b amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.\n\nThe amount of deferred tax assets recognised takes into account the b likelihood the amount that can be used to o \u038d set payable taxes on future pro \u0234 ts.\n\nDeferred tax related to fair value re-measurement of FVOCI investments is recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the FVOCI revaluation reserves.\n\n## 3. Critical Accounting Estimates\n\nThe Group's accounting policies and use of estimates are integral to the reported amounts in the \u0234 nancial statements. Certain accounting estimates require management's judgement in determining the appropriate methodology for valuation of assets and liabilities. Procedures are in place to ensure that methodologies are reviewed and revised as appropriate. The Group believes its estimates for determining the valuation of its assets and liabilities are appropriate.\n\nThe following is a brief description of the Group's critical accounting estimates that involve management's valuation judgement.\n\n## 3.1 Impairment of \u0234 nancial assets\n\nIt is the Group's policy to recognise, through charges against pro \u0234 t, allowances in respect of estimated and inherent credit losses in its portfolio as described in Note 2.11.\n\nECLs are unbiased and probability-weighted estimates of credit losses determined by evaluating a range of possible outcomes, considering past events, current conditions and assessments of future economic conditions at the reporting date. This will necessarily involve the use of judgement.\n\nPlease refer to Risk Management section for a further description of the Group's credit risk management framework, policies and procedures.\n\n## 3.2 Fair value of \u0234 nancial instruments\n\nThe majority of the Group's \u0234 nancial instruments reported at fair value are based on quoted and observable market prices or on internally developed models that are based on independently sourced or veri \u0234 ed market parameters.\n\nThe fair value of \u0234 nancial instruments without an observable market price in an active market may be determined using valuation models. The choice of model requires signi \u0234 cant judgement for complex products especially those in the 'Treasury Markets' segment.\n\nPolicies and procedures have been established to facilitate the exercise of judgement in determining the risk characteristics of various \u0234 nancial instruments, discount rates, estimates of future cash \u0235 ows and other factors used in the valuation process.\n\nPlease refer to Note 41 for further details on fair valuation and fair value hierarchy of the Group's \u0234 nancial instruments measured at fair value.\n\n## 3.3 Goodwill impairment\n\nThe Group performs an impairment review to ensure that the carrying amount of a CGU to which goodwill is allocated does not exceed the recoverable amount of the CGU. Note 27 provides details of goodwill at b the reporting date.\n\nThe recoverable amount represents the present value of the estimated future cash \u0235 ows expected to arise from continuing operations. Therefore, in arriving at the recoverable amount, management exercises judgement in estimating the future cash \u0235 ows, growth rate and discount rate.\n\n## 3.4 Income taxes\n\nThe Group has exposure to income taxes in several jurisdictions. The Group recognises liabilities for expected tax issues based on reasonable estimate of whether additional tax will be due. Where uncertainty exists around the Group's tax position, appropriate provisions are provided based on the technical assessment of the cases. Where the \u0234 nal tax outcome of these positions is di \u038d erent from the provision provided, the di \u038d erences will impact the income tax and deferred tax balances in the period in which the \u0234 nal tax is determined.

Stage 2 ECLs are also measured on lifetime basis\n\n## Sensitivity of ECL\n\nThe Group assessed ECL sensitivity for the wholesale and retail portfolios to changes in the allocation of exposures between Stages 1 and 2. ECL is estimated to reduce by $663 million (2022: $804 million) should all the exposures in Stage 2 return to Stage 1 and were assigned a lower 12-month ECL instead of lifetime ECL. b The impact also re \u0235 ects the higher PDs ascribed to Stage 2 exposures in addition to the recognition of lifetime b instead of 12-month ECL.\n\nAs ECL estimation relies on multiple variables, no single analysis can fully demonstrate the sensitivity of the ECL to changes in macroeconomic variables.",

As the Group has a legally enforceable right to set o \u038d directly cleared assets and liabilities under all circumstances (including default/ insolvency of the Group and the clearing house) and intends to settle net cash \u0235 ows including variation margins with the clearing house, $15,897 million (2022: Nil) of derivative assets were o \u038d set against $15,526 million (2022: Nil) of derivative liabilities and $371 million (2022: Nil) of cash collateral recorded in other assets/ liabilities.\n\n## Financial assets and liabilities subject to netting agreements but not o \u038d set on the balance sheet\n\nThe Group enters into master netting arrangements with counterparties where it is appropriate and feasible to do so to mitigate counterparty risk. The credit risk associated with favourable contracts is reduced by a master netting arrangement to the extent that if an event of default occurs, all amounts with the counterparty are settled on a net basis. Master netting arrangements do not result in an o \u038d set of \u0234 nancial assets and liabilities on the balance sheet, as the legal right to o \u038d set the transactions is conditional upon default.\n\nThese agreements include derivative master agreements (including the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) Master Agreement), global master repurchase agreements and global securities lending agreements. The collaterals received and pledged under these agreements are generally conducted under terms that are in accordance with normal market practice. The agreements may allow rehypothecation of collateral received and there may be ongoing margin requirements to mitigate counterparty risk.\n\nThe disclosures set out in the tables below pertain to \u0234 nancial assets and liabilities that are not o \u038d set in the Group's balance sheet but are subject to master netting arrangements or similar agreements that cover similar \u0234 nancial instruments. The disclosures enable the understanding of both the gross and net amounts, as well as provide additional information on how such credit risk is mitigated.\n\n|                               | The Group                    | The Group                   | The Group    | The Group                                        | The Group                                        | The Group    |\n|-------------------------------|------------------------------|-----------------------------|--------------|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|--------------|\n|                               | Carrying                     | Not subject to  enforceable |              | Related amounts not o \u038d  set b on  balance sheet | Related amounts not o \u038d  set b on  balance sheet |              |\n| In $ millions                 | amounts  on b balance  sheet | netting  agreement          | Net  amounts | Financial  instruments                           | Financial collateral  received/ pledged          | Net  amounts |\n| 2023                          |                              |                             |              |                                                  |                                                  |              |\n| Financial Assets              |                              |                             |              |                                                  |                                                  |              |\n| Derivatives                   | 22,700                       | 5,781 (a)                   | 16,919       | 12,678 (a)                                       | 1,416                                            | 2,825        |\n| Reverse repurchase agreements | 40,365 (b)                   | -

Financial Assets Pledged or Transferred\n\nThe Group pledges or transfers \u0234 nancial assets to third parties in the ordinary course of business. Transferred assets continue to be recognised in the Group's \u0234 nancial statements when the Group retains substantially all their risks and rewards.\n\nThe \u0234 nancial assets pledged as collateral are mainly for repurchase, securities lending and collateral swap agreements, derivative transactions under credit support agreements and in connection with the Group's covered bond program and secured note issuances.\n\n## Repurchase, securities lending and collateral swap agreement\n\nSecurities transferred under repurchase, securities lending and collateral swap arrangements are generally conducted under terms in line with normal market practice. The counterparty is typically allowed to sell or re-pledge the securities but has an obligation to return them at maturity. If the securities decrease in value, the Group may, in certain circumstances, be required to place additional collateral.\n\nFor repurchase agreements, the securities pledged or transferred continue to be recorded on the balance sheet while cash received in exchange is recorded as a \u0234 nancial liability. The Group also pledges assets to secure its short position in securities and to facilitate settlement operations. The fair value of the associated liabilities approximates their carrying amount of $9,321 million (2022: $9,020 million), which are recorded under 'Due to banks', 'Deposits and balances from customers' and 'Other liabilities' on the balance sheet.\n\nFor securities lending and collateral swap transactions, the securities lent continue to be recorded on the balance sheet. As the Group mainly receives other \u0234 nancial assets in exchange, the associated liabilities are not recorded on the balance sheet.\n\n## Derivatives\n\nIn addition, the Group pledges securities for derivative transactions under credit support agreements. These assets continue to be recorded on the balance sheet. As the related derivative assets and liabilities are managed on a portfolio basis, there is no direct relationship between the securities pledged and the associated liabilities. As such, the associated liabilities are not disclosed.\n\n## Covered bonds and secured notes\n\nPursuant to the Bank's Global Covered Bond Programme, selected pools of residential mortgages originated by the Bank have been assigned to a bankruptcy-remote structured entity, Bayfront Covered Bonds Pte. Ltd. (see Notes 22.2 and 30.4). b These residential mortgages continue to be recognised on the Bank's balance sheet as the Bank remains exposed to the risks and rewards associated with them.\n\nPursuant to secured notes issued by the Bank, selected loan assets have been assigned as security (see Note 30.4). The Group remains the legal and bene \u0234 cial owner of the loan assets and the loan assets continue to be recognised on the Group's balance sheet.\n\nAs at 31 December 2023, the carrying value of the covered bonds and secured notes in issue was $13,166 million (2022: $7,575 million), while the carrying value of assets assigned was $25,560 million (2022: $16,740 million). b The di \u038d erence in values is attributable to an intended overcollateralisation required to maintain the credit ratings of the covered bonds in issue, and additional assets assigned to facilitate future issuances.\n\nThe table below presents the assets pledged as collateral under the aforementioned transactions.\n\n| In $ millions                                      | 2023   | 2022   |\n|----------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Singapore government securities and treasury bills | 2,147  | 2,773  |\n| Other government securities and treasury bills     | 6,179  | 7,339  |\n| Bank and corporate debt securities                 | 3,767  | 2,641  |\n| Equity securities                                  | 1,135  | 1,232  |\n| Certi \u0234  cates of deposit                          | 507    | 504    |\n| Cash collateral pledged (Note 20)                  | 5,208  | 6,201  |\n| Loans and advances to customers (a)                | 25,560 | 16,740 |\n| Total                                              | 44,503 | 37,430 |\n\n## (a) Refers to the loans pledged under covered bond program and secured notes issuances and re \u0235 ect the intended over-collateralisation\n\nThere were no derecognised assets that were subject to the Group's partial continuing involvement as at 31 December 2023 and 31 b December 2022.\n\n## 20.

In the Singapore 2023 Budget Statement, the Singapore government announced plans to implement the GloBE rules as well as a domestic top-up tax (DTT) beginning on or after 1 January 2025. Since the Pillar Two legislation has not been enacted in Singapore, the jurisdiction in which DBS Group Holdings Ltd is incorporated, and is thus not e \u038d ective at the reporting date, the Group has no related current tax exposure. The Group has applied the exception to recognising and disclosing information about deferred tax assets and liabilities related to Pillar Two income taxes, as provided in the amendments to SFRS(I) 1-12 International Tax Reform-Pillar Two Model Rules issued in May 2023.\n\nUnder the GloBE model rules, the GloBE e \u038d ective tax rate (ETR) is assessed on a jurisdictional basis and top up tax is payable if the jurisdictional ETR is below 15%. The GloBE ETR is not exactly the same as accounting ETR. However, if the accounting ETR were to be used to assess the potential GloBE implications, DBS entities in most jurisdictions are operating with an average accounting ETR that exceeds 15%, except for Singapore, Macau, Malaysia and United Arab Emirates (UAE). Please refer to the geographical segment information in Note 45.2 for details on Singapore's accounting pro \u0234 ts and tax expenses. As of the issuance date of these \u0234 nancial statements, Singapore has not announced when and how the GloBE rules will be enacted. Consequently, it is not presently feasible to reasonably estimate the quantitative impact of this legislation. The Group is actively engaged in evaluating its potential exposure to these forthcoming regulations. The impact of Pillar Two for Macau, Malaysia and b UAE is expected to be immaterial.\n\nJapan, South Korea, United Kingdom and Vietnam have respectively either announced draft legislations or enacted legislations to implement Pillar Two in 2024. The average accounting ETRs of the DBS entities operating in these jurisdictions are above 15%, without considering the various elections available and adjustments required under the GloBE model rules. While the exact quantitative impact cannot be reasonably estimated as yet due to the complexities in applying the legislations, the impact of Pillar Two is expected to be immaterial.\n\nerences\n\n204\n\n137\n\nset against deferred tax assets\n\n(263)\n\n(257)\n\n## 22.

Unconsolidated Structured Entities\n\n'Unconsolidated structured entities' are structured entities, as de \u0234 ned by SFRS(I) 12, that are not controlled by the Group. In the normal course of business, the Group enters into transactions with these structured entities to facilitate customer transactions and for speci \u0234 c investment opportunities.\n\nWhile the economic exposures may be the same as those to other types of entities, SFRS(I) 12 speci \u0234 cally requires companies to disclose such exposures arising from transactions with unconsolidated structured entities. The table below re \u0235 ects exposures to third party securitisation structures where the Group holds an interest in the normal course of business.\n\nAs is the case with other types of counterparties, the carrying amount from transactions with unconsolidated structured entities have been included in the Group's \u0234 nancial statements.\n\nThe risks arising from such transactions are subject to the Group's risk management practices.\n\nThe table below represents the Group's maximum exposure to loss which for on-balance sheet assets and liabilities is represented by the carrying amount, and does not re \u0235 ect mitigating e \u038d ects from the availability of netting arrangements and \u0234 nancial instruments that the Group may utilise to manage the risks inherent in third party structured entities, or risk-reducing e \u038d ects of collateral or other credit enhancements.\n\n|                          | The Group   | The Group   |\n|--------------------------|-------------|-------------|\n| In $ millions            | 2023        | 2022        |\n| Derivatives              | 84          | 25          |\n| Corporate securities     | 5,204       | 4,017       |\n| Other assets             | 7           | 3           |\n| Total assets             | 5,295       | 4,045       |\n| Commitments              | 617         | 799         |\n| Maximum exposure to loss | 5,912       | 4,844       |\n| Derivatives              | 154         | 244         |\n| Total liabilities        | 154         | 244         |\n\nSFRS(I) 12 also requires additional disclosures where the Group acts as a sponsor to unconsolidated structured entities. The Group is deemed a sponsor of a structured entity if it plays a key role in establishing the entity, and has an on-going involvement with the structured entity or if the Group's name appears in the structured entity's name.\n\nThere are certain investment funds where the Group is the fund manager and the investors have no or limited removal rights over the fund manager. These funds are primarily subscribed by the investors. As of 31 December 2023, the Group did not hold any investment in these investment funds. The table below summarises the Group's involvement in the funds.\n\n|                                                          |   The Group |   The Group |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|\n| In $ millions                                            |        2023 |        2022 |\n| Total assets of the sponsored structured entities        |         613 |         476 |\n| Fee income earned from the sponsored structured entities |           6 |           8 |\n\n## 25. Acquisition\n\n## Consumer banking business of Citigroup Inc in Taiwan ('Citi Taiwan')\n\nIn August 2023, the Group completed the acquisition of the consumer banking business of Citigroup Inc in Taiwan ('Citi Taiwan') via a transfer of assets and liabilities. With the acquisition of Citi Taiwan, DBS Taiwan has become Taiwan's largest foreign bank by assets and will have clear market leadership in loans, deposits, cards and investments among foreign players in the market. The acquisition is in line with the Group's strategy to scale up its investment and accelerates its expansion in Taiwan.\n\nThe Group has paid a cash consideration of $936 million for the assets acquired (comprising mainly foreign currency cash accounts and loans and advances) of $12.6 billion and the liabilities assumed (comprising mainly deposits and balances with customers and pension liabilities) of $12.4 billion.\n\nThe provisional goodwill and intangible assets arising from the acquisition were $763 million (TWD 17.8 billion) and $232 million respectively as b of 31 December 2023. Intangible assets mainly relate to customer relationships and core deposits.\n\nThe contribution to the Group's net pro \u0234 t from the consolidation of the acquired Citi Taiwan from 12 August 2023 to 31 December 2023 was not material.\n\nIntegration costs of $135 million were included in the Group's expenses for the year ended 31 December 2023 in the audited consolidated income statement.",

Goodwill and Intangible Assets\n\nThe carrying amounts of the Group's goodwill and intangible assets arising from business acquisitions are as follows:\n\n|                                              | The Group   | The Group   |\n|----------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|\n| In $ millions                                | 2023        | 2022        |\n| Goodwill                                     |             |             |\n| DBS Bank (Hong Kong) Limited                 | 4,631       | 4,631       |\n| DBS Taiwan consumer banking business (a)     | 763         | -           |\n| Others                                       | 687         | 709         |\n| Sub-total                                    | 6,081       | 5,340       |\n| Intangible assets                            |             |             |\n| Customer relationships and core deposits (b) | 232         | -           |\n| Total Goodwill and intangible assets         | 6,313       | 5,340       |\n\nGoodwill is reviewed on an annual basis or when indicators of impairment exist.\n\nThe more material goodwill at the Group relates to DBS Bank (Hong Kong) Limited's franchise and DBS Taiwan Consumer Banking Business. The b recoverable value of the franchise is determined based on a value-in-use calculation. The CGU's \u0234 ve-year projected free cash \u0235 ows, after taking into account the maintenance of capital adequacy requirements at target levels, are discounted by its cost of capital to derive its b present value. To derive the value beyond the \u0234 fth year, a long-term growth rate is imputed to the \u0234 fth-year cash \u0235 ow and then discounted by b the cost of capital to derive the terminal value. The long-term growth rate used does not exceed the historical long-term growth rate of the b market the CGU operates in. The recoverable value is the sum of the present value of the \u0234 ve-year cash \u0235 ows and the terminal value.\n\nA growth rate of 3.5% (2022: 3.5%) and discount rate of 9.0% (2022: 9.0%) were assumed in the value-in-use calculation for DBS Bank (Hong b Kong) Limited's franchise.\n\nThe process of evaluating goodwill impairment involves management judgement and prudent estimates of various factors including future cash \u0235 ows as well as the cost of capital and long-term growth rates. The results can be highly sensitive to the assumptions used. Key assumptions used to determine the recoverable amounts of the CGU, including growth rate and discount rate, are tested for sensitivity by applying a reasonably possible change to those assumptions. The reasonably possible changes in key assumptions did not result in an impairment of goodwill as at 31 December 2023.\n\n## 28.

Financial Derivatives\n\n## 36.1 Trading derivatives\n\nMost of the Group's derivatives relate to sales and trading activities. Sales activities include the structuring and marketing of derivatives to customers to enable them to take, transfer, modify or reduce current or expected risks. Trading activities are entered into principally for dealer's margin or for the purpose of generating a pro \u0234 t from short-term \u0235 uctuations in price.\n\nTrading includes mainly market-making and warehousing to facilitate customer orders. Market-making involves quoting bid and o \u038d er prices to other market participants with the intention of generating revenues based on spread and volume. Warehousing involves holding on to positions in order to liquidate in an orderly fashion with timing of unwinding determined by market conditions and traders' views of markets as they evolve.\n\n## 36.2 Hedging derivatives\n\nApart from derivatives which are designated in hedge accounting relationships (Note 38), all other derivatives including those used for risk management purposes are treated in the same way as trading derivatives.\n\nThe following table summarises the contractual or underlying principal amounts of derivative \u0234 nancial instruments held or issued for trading and hedging purposes outstanding at balance sheet date.

        "page_content": "## 37. Interest Rate Benchmark Reform\n\nIn 2023, the Group has transitioned most of its Interbank O \u038d ered Rates (IBOR) contracts that are subject to cessation.\n\nThe remaining contracts that require transition relate mainly to Fallback Rate (SOR) and SIBOR (Singapore Interbank O \u038d ered Rate). For these rates, the industry has agreed with MAS on the transition approach to SORA (Singapore Overnight Rate Average), including timing and Adjustment Spread. The Group is also engaging its customers to transition out of the contracts referencing Synthetic USD LIBOR (London Interbank O \u038d ered Rate).\n\n## 38. Hedge Accounting\n\nThe Group enters into hedging transactions to manage exposures to interest rate and foreign currency risks. Hedge accounting is applied to minimise volatility in earnings arising from changes in interest rate and foreign exchange rates.\n\nPlease refer to Risk Management section for more information on market risk and the Group's risk management practices and Note 2.19 for the Group's accounting policy for hedge accounting.\n\n## 38.1 Fair value hedge\n\nIn accordance with the risk management strategy in place, the Group enters into interest rate swaps to mitigate the risk of changes in interest rates on the fair value of the following:\n\n- \u00b7 issued \u0234 xed rate debt;\n- \u00b7 \u0234 xed rate bonds;\n- \u00b7 \u0234 xed rate loans;\n- \u00b7 account receivable purchase;\n- \u00b7 bond repos; and\n- \u00b7 deposits and borrowings.\n\nIn such instances, the Group hedges the benchmark interest rate risk component which is an observable and reliably measurable component of interest rate risk. Speci \u0234 cally, the Group has designated fair value hedge relationships, on a hedge-by-hedge basis, to hedge against movements in the benchmark interest rate. This e \u038d ectively results in the recognition of interest expense (for \u0234 xed rate liabilities), or interest income (for \u0234 xed rate assets) at \u0235 oating rates. The Group also uses cross currency swaps when there is a need to hedge both interest rate and foreign exchange risks.\n\nFor risks not covered by hedge accounting, the Group manages these in accordance with its risk management strategy.\n\nThe Group assesses prospective hedge e \u038d ectiveness by comparing the changes in fair value of the hedged item resulting from movements in the benchmark interest rate with the changes in fair value of the interest rate swaps used to hedge the exposure. The Group determines the hedge ratio by comparing the notional of the derivative with the principal of the debt issued or the bond asset purchased, or the loan granted.\n\nThe Group has identi \u0234 ed the following possible sources of ine \u038d ectiveness:\n\n- \u00b7 the use of derivatives as a protection against interest rate risk creates an exposure to the derivative counterparty's credit risk which is not b o \u038d set by the hedged item. This risk is minimised by entering into derivatives with high credit quality counterparties;\n- \u00b7 the use of di \u038d erent discounting curves when measuring the fair value of the hedged items and hedging instruments. For derivatives, the b discounting curve used depends on collateralisation and the type of collateral used;\n- \u00b7 di \u038d erence in tenor of hedged items and hedging instruments;\n- \u00b7 di \u038d erence in the timing of settlement of hedging instruments and hedged items.\n- \u00b7 \u0234 xing risk or di \u038d erence in \u0234 xing rate of hedging instruments and implied forward rate on hedged items; and\n- \u00b7 di \u038d erence in hedged rate between hedged item and hedging instrument.\n\nThe Group also uses foreign currency denominated borrowings/ deposits to fund its investments in non-SGD denominated FVOCI equity instruments. To reduce the accounting mismatch on the borrowings/ deposits and FVOCI equity instruments because of foreign exchange rate movements, the Group designates the borrowings/ deposits as the hedging instruments in fair value hedges of the FVOCI equity instruments. The hedge ratio is determined by comparing the principal of the borrowings/ deposits with the investment costs of the FVOCI equity instruments. A potential source of ine \u038d ectiveness is a decrease in the fair value of the equity instruments below their investment costs.\n\nThe following table sets out the maturity pro \u0234 le of the hedging instruments used in fair value hedges. The amounts shown in the table re \u0235 ect the notional amounts of derivatives and the carrying amounts of borrowings and deposits. Please refer to Note 36 for the carrying values of the derivatives.\n\n|                                                              |                                  | The Group         | The Group     | The Group          | The Group   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|-------------------|---------------|--------------------|-------------|\n| In $ millions                                                | Type of risk hedged              | Less than  1 year | 1 to 5  years | More than  5 years | Total       |\n| 2023                                                         |                                  |                   |               |                    |             |\n| Derivatives (notional)                                       |                                  |                   |               |                    |             |\n| Interest rate swaps                                          | Interest rate                    | 5,785             | 10,556        | 2,600              | 18,941      |\n| Currency swaps                                               | Interest rate & Foreign exchange | -

These are applied on a hedge-by-hedge basis or portfolio basis, for example:\n\n- \u00b7 For cash \u0235 ows from assets subject to repricing or reinvestment risk, a portfolio cash \u0235 ow hedge relationship is designated using interest rate swaps. A dynamic process is applied for this hedge as the portfolio composition can change e.g. due to maturities and new originations. The portfolio cash \u0235 ow hedge relationship e \u038d ectively extends the duration of the assets, such that the interest cash \u0235 ows are transformed from a \u0235 oating rate basis to a \u0234 xed rate basis.\n- \u00b7 Foreign currency forwards and swaps are used to hedge against variability in future cash \u0235 ows arising from USD-denominated interest income, and to hedge against foreign exchange movements arising from a portfolio of foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities.\n- \u00b7 Cross currency swaps are used to mitigate the risk of \u0235 uctuation of coupon and principal cash \u0235 ows due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates of issued foreign currency debt and foreign currency bonds.\n- \u00b7 Bond forwards are used to reduce exposures to foreign currency bonds.\n\nFor risks not covered by hedge accounting, the Group manages these in accordance with its risk management strategy.\n\nThe Group assesses hedge e \u038d ectiveness by comparing the changes in fair value of a hypothetical derivative re \u0235 ecting the terms of the hedged item due to movements in the hedged risk with the changes in fair value of the derivatives used to hedge the exposure.\n\nThe Group determines the hedge ratio by comparing the notional of the derivatives with the assets subject to repricing/ reinvestment/ re \u0234 nancing risk or amount of forecast earnings denominated in foreign currency or the principal of the debt securities issued or purchased foreign currency bonds.\n\nThe Group has identi \u0234 ed the following possible sources of ine \u038d ectiveness in its cash \u0235 ow hedge relationships:\n\n- \u00b7 the use of derivatives as a protection against currency and interest rate risk creates an exposure to the derivative counterparty's credit risk which is not o \u038d set by the hedged item. This risk is minimised by entering into derivatives with high credit quality counterparties;\n- \u00b7 di \u038d erence in tenor of hedged items and hedging instruments;\n- \u00b7 di \u038d erence in timing of settlement of the hedging instrument and hedged item; and\n- \u00b7 designation of o \u038d -market hedging instruments.\n\nThe following table sets out the maturity pro \u0234 le of the hedging instruments used in cash \u0235 ow hedges. The amounts shown in the table re \u0235 ect the notional amounts of derivatives.

Share-based Compensation Plans\n\nAs part of the Group's remuneration policy, the Group provides various share-based compensation plans to foster a culture that aligns employees' interests with shareholders', enable employees to share in the Group's performance and enhance talent retention.\n\n| Main Scheme/ Plan            | Note   |\n|------------------------------|--------|\n| DBSH Share Plan (Share Plan) |        |\n\n- \u00b7 The Share Plan is granted to Group executives as determined by the Compensation and Management Development Committee ('Committee') which has been appointed to administer the Share Plan from time to time.\n- \u00b7 Participants are awarded shares of the Company or, at the Committee's discretion, their equivalent cash value or a combination.\n- \u00b7 The share awards consist of a main award and a retention award for employees on bonus/ sales incentive plans. Dividends on unvested shares do not accrue to employees.\n- \u00b7 The Directors reviewed and approved the proposed changes to the vesting schedule and retention awards on 5 b December 2022. These would apply to shares granted from 2023, and there are no changes to the vesting schedule and b retention awards for shares that had been granted in earlier periods:\n\n## Vesting schedule\n\n- \u00b7 For employees on bonus plan (including key employees who are also awarded shares as part of talent retention):\n- -The main award granted prior to February 2023 will vest 2 to 4 years after grant i.e. 33% will vest 2 years after grant; another 33% will vest on the third year and the remaining 34% plus the retention award will vest 4 years after grant.\n- -The main award granted from February 2023 will vest 1 to 4 years after grant i.e. 25% will vest each year. The b retention award will vest 4 years after grant.\n- \u00b7 Special Awards are granted as part of talent retention for selected individuals.\n- -Special Awards granted prior to February 2023 will vest 2 to 4 years after grant i.e. 33% will vest 2 years after grant; another 33% will vest on the third year and the remaining 34% will vest 4 years after grant.\n- -Special Awards granted from February 2023 will vest 1 to 3 years after grant; i.e. 33% will vest 1 year after grant, another 33% will vest on the second year and the remaining 34% will vest 3 years after grant.\n\n## Retention award\n\n- \u00b7 For share awards granted from 2023, the retention award for employees on bonus plan was reduced from 20% to 15% following the change in the vesting schedule.\n- \u00b7 There is no retention award for Special Awards.\n- \u00b7 For employees on sales incentive plan, the main award will vest 1 to 3 years after grant; i.e. 33% will vest 1 year after grant, another 33% will vest on the second year and the remaining 34% plus the retention award will vest 3 years after grant. The retention award remains unchanged at 15%.\n- \u00b7 All the DBSH Share Plan awards will lapse immediately upon termination of employment, except in the event of ill health, injury, disability, redundancy, retirement or death.\n- \u00b7 The market price of shares on the grant date is used to estimate the fair value of the shares awarded. The fair value of the shares granted includes an adjustment to exclude the present value of future expected dividends to be paid during the vesting period.\n- \u00b7 Vested and unvested shares are subject to clawback/ malus. Conditions that trigger such clawback/ malus are in the Remuneration Report section of the Annual Report.\n- \u00b7 Shares are awarded to non-executive Directors as part of director's remuneration. Details of these awards are disclosed in the Corporate Governance section of the Annual Report.\n\n## DBSH Employee Share Plan (ESP)\n\n- \u00b7 The Committee has ceased granting shares under the ESP e \u038d ective from \u0234 nancial year 2018 remuneration. All b outstanding ESP share grants have fully vested in 2022.\n\n## DBSH Employee Share Purchase Plan (ESPP)\n\n- \u00b7 The ESPP was implemented in 2019 in selective markets across the Group. All permanent employees who hold the rank of Vice President and below are eligible to participate in the scheme.\n- \u00b7 The ESPP is a share ownership plan for eligible employees to own DBSH shares through monthly contributions via deductions from payroll or designated bank accounts.\n- \u00b7 Participants contribute up to 10% of month salary (minimum S$50, capped at S$1,000) and the Group will match 25% of b the participant's contributions to buy DBSH ordinary shares for a period of 12 months during each plan year.\n- \u00b7 The matching shares bought from the Group's contribution will vest 24 months after the last contribution month for each plan year.\n- \u00b7 The matching shares will lapse immediately upon termination of employment, except in the event of ill health, injury, disability, redundancy, retirement or death.\n\n39.1\n\n39.2\n\n## 39.1 DBSH Share Plan and DBSH Employee Share Plan\n\nThe following table sets out the movements of the awards during the year.\n\n|                                                                   | The Group   | The Group   | The Group   | The Group   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|\n|                                                                   | 2023        | 2023        | 2022        | 2022        |\n| Number of shares                                                  | Share Plan  | ESP         | Share Plan  | ESP         |\n| Balance at 1 January                                              | 16,138,420  | -           | 17,105,292  | 145,804     |\n| Granted (a)                                                       | 5,778,718   | -           | 5,068,826   | -           |\n| Vested                                                            | (5,584,985) | -           | (5,205,424) | (145,138)   |\n| Forfeited/ others                                                 | (357,378)   | -           | (830,274)   | (666)       |\n| Balance at 31 December                                            | 15,974,775  | -           | 16,138,420  | -           |\n| Weighted average fair value of the shares granted during the year | $29.75      |             | $32.35      |             |\n\n- (a) 2023 includes adjustments (229,765 shares) made to all unvested share awards following the shareholders' approval for the special dividend of $0.50 per ordinary share at DBSH's Annual General Meeting held on 31 March 2023 in accordance with terms of the Share Plan\n\n## 39.2 DBSH Employee Share Purchase Plan\n\nThe following table sets out the movements of the shares during the year.\n\n|                                                                   | The Group   | The Group   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|\n| Number of shares                                                  | 2023        | 2022        |\n| Balance at 1 January                                              | 1,320,131   | 1,403,440   |\n| Granted                                                           | 629,333     | 503,737     |\n| Vested (b)                                                        | (523,660)   | (446,839)   |\n| Forfeited                                                         | (73,932)    | (140,207)   |\n| Balance at 31 December                                            | 1,351,872   | 1,320,131   |\n| Weighted average fair value of the shares granted during the year | $28.05      | $29.39      |\n\n## 40.

        "page_content": "## 41. Fair Value of Financial Instruments\n\n## 41.1 Valuation Process\n\nThe valuation processes within the Group are governed by the Valuation Policy, which is approved by the Board Audit Committee.\n\nThe Valuation Policy applies to all \u0234 nancial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value, covering both market prices as well as model inputs. Financial assets and liabilities are marked directly using reliable and independent quoted market prices where available or by using reliable and independent market parameters (as model inputs) in conjunction with a valuation model.\n\nValuation models go through an assurance process carried out by the Risk Management Group (RMG), independent of the model developers. b This assurance process covers the review of the underlying methodology including its logic and conceptual soundness together with the model inputs and outputs. Model assurances are conducted prior to implementation and subject to regular review or when there are signi \u0234 cant changes arising from market or portfolio changes. b Where necessary, the Group also imposes model reserves and other adjustments in determining fair value. b Models are approved by the Group Market and Liquidity Risk Committee (GMLRC).\n\nA process of independent price veri \u0234 cation (IPV) is in place to establish the accuracy of the market parameters used when the marking is performed by the Front O \u025d ce. The IPV process entails independent checks to compare traders' marks to independent sources such as broker/ dealer quotes or market consensus providers.\n\nWhere market parameters are sourced independently for the marking of \u0234 nancial assets and liabilities, or used as inputs into a valuation model, these are checked for reliability and accuracy, for example by reviewing large daily movements or by referencing other similar sources, or transactions.\n\nValuation adjustments and reserves are taken to account for closeout costs, model and market parameter uncertainty, and any other factor that may a \u038d ect valuations. Valuation adjustment and reserve methodologies are approved by the GMLRC and governed by the Valuation Policy.\n\nThe valuation adjustments and reserves include but are not limited to:\n\n## Model and Parameter Uncertainty Adjustments\n\nValuation uncertainties may occur during fair value measurement either due to uncertainties in the required input parameters or uncertainties in the modelling methods used in the valuation process. In such situations, adjustments may be necessary to take these factors into account.\n\nFor example, where market data such as prices or rates for an instrument are no longer observable after an extended period of time, these inputs used to value the \u0234 nancial instruments may no longer be relevant in the current market conditions. In such situations, adjustments may be necessary to address the pricing uncertainty arising from the use of stale market data inputs.\n\n## Credit Valuation Adjustments\n\nCredit valuation adjustments are taken to re \u0235 ect the impact on fair value of counterparty credit risk. Credit valuation adjustments are based upon the creditworthiness of the counterparties, magnitude of the current or potential exposure on the underlying transactions, netting and collateral arrangements, and the maturity of the underlying transactions.\n\n## Funding Valuation Adjustments\n\nFunding valuation adjustments represent an estimate of the adjustment to fair value that a market participant would make in incorporating funding costs and bene \u0234 ts that arise in relation to uncollateralised derivatives positions.\n\n## Day 1 Pro \u0234 t or Loss (P&L) Reserve\n\nIn situations where the market for an instrument is not active and its fair value is established using a valuation model based on signi \u0234 cant unobservable market parameters, the Day 1 P&L arising from the di \u038d erence in transacted price and end-of-day model valuation is set aside as reserves. A market parameter is de \u0234 ned as being signi \u0234 cant when its impact on the Day 1 P&L is greater than an internally determined threshold. The Day 1 P&L reserve is released to the income statement when the parameters become observable or when the transaction is closed out or amortised over the duration of the transaction. At year end, the unamortised Day 1 P&L was not material.\n\n## Bid-O \u038d er Adjustments\n\nThe Group often holds, at varying points in time, both long or short b positions in \u0234 nancial instruments which are valued using midmarket levels. Bid-o \u038d er adjustments are then made to account for close-out costs.\n\n## 41.2 Fair Value Hierarchy\n\nThe fair value hierarchy accords the highest level to observable inputs such as unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest level to unobservable inputs. The fair value measurement of each \u0234 nancial instrument is categorised in accordance with the same level of the fair value hierarchy as the input with the lowest level that is signi \u0234 cant to the entire measurement. If unobservable inputs are deemed signi \u0234 cant, the \u0234 nancial instrument will be categorised as Level 3.\n\nFinancial instruments that are valued using quoted prices in active markets are classi \u0234 ed as Level 1 within the fair value hierarchy. These would include government and sovereign securities, listed equities and corporate debt securities which are actively traded. Derivatives contracts which are traded in an active exchange market are also classi \u0234 ed as Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy.\n\nWhere fair value is determined using quoted market prices in less active markets or quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities, such instruments are generally classi \u0234 ed as Level 2. In cases where quoted prices are generally not available, the Group will determine the fair value based on valuation techniques that use market parameters as inputs including but not limited to yield curves, volatilities and foreign exchange rates. The majority of valuation techniques employ only observable market data so that reliability of the fair value measurement is high. These would include corporate debt securities, repurchase, reverse repurchase agreements and most of the Group's over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives.\n\nThe Group classi \u0234 es \u0234 nancial instruments as Level 3 when there is reliance on unobservable market parameters whether used directly to value a \u0234 nancial asset or liability, or used as inputs to a valuation model, attributing to a signi \u0234 cant contribution to the instrument value. These would include all input parameters which are derived from historical data, for example, asset correlations or certain volatilities. Level 3 instruments also include unquoted equity securities which are measured based on the net asset value of the investments. In addition, Level 3 inputs include all stale quoted security prices and other approximations (e.g. bonds valued using credit default swap spreads).\n\nThe following tables present assets and liabilities measured at fair value, classi \u0234 ed by level within the fair value hierarchy.\n\n|                                            | The Group   | The Group   | The Group   | The Group   |\n|--------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|\n| In $ millions                              | Level 1     | Level 2     | Level 3     | Total       |\n| 2023                                       |             |             |             |             |\n| Assets                                     |             |             |             |             |\n| Financial assets at FVPL                   |             |             |             |             |\n| - Government securities and treasury bills | 13,130      | 3,147       | -           | 16,277      |\n| - Bank and corporate securities            | 16,947      | 4,782       | 108 (a)     | 21,837      |\n| - Other  \u0234  nancial assets                 | 368         | 28,955      | -           | 29,323      |\n| FVOCI  \u0234  nancial assets                   |             |             |             |             |\n| - Government securities and treasury bills | 27,340      | 2,492       | -           | 29,832      |\n| - Bank and corporate securities            | 17,694      | 5,248       | 632         | 23,574      |\n| - Other  \u0234  nancial assets                 | -           | 5,052       | -           | 5,052       |\n| Derivatives                                | 35          | 22,543      | 122         | 22,700      |\n| Liabilities                                |             |             |             |             |\n| Financial liabilities at FVPL              |             |             |             |             |\n| - Other debt securities                    | -           | 15,880      | -           | 15,880      |\n| - Other  \u0234  nancial liabilities            | 3,040       | 25,710      | -           | 28,750      |\n| Derivatives                                | 57          | 23,399      | 1           | 23,457      |\n| 2022                                       |             |             |             |             |\n| Assets                                     |             |             |             |             |\n| Financial assets at FVPL                   |             |             |             |             |\n| - Government securities and treasury bills | 9,936       | 3,309       | 1           | 13,246      |\n| - Bank and corporate securities            | 16,843      | 4,516       | 170         | 21,529      |\n| - Other  \u0234  nancial assets                 | 98          | 24,702      | -           | 24,800      |\n| FVOCI  \u0234  nancial assets                   |             |             |             |             |\n| - Government securities and treasury bills | 25,781      | 2,377       | -           | 28,158      |\n| - Bank and corporate securities            | 18,202      | 3,538       | 607         | 22,347      |\n| - Other  \u0234  nancial assets                 | -           | 5,623       | -           | 5,623       |\n| Derivatives                                | 70          | 44,714      | 151         | 44,935      |\n| Liabilities                                |             |             |             |             |\n| Financial liabilities at FVPL              |             |             |             |             |\n| - Other debt securities                    | -           | 8,143       | -           | 8,143       |\n| - Other  \u0234  nancial liabilities            | 2,300       | 17,681      | 1           | 19,982      |\n| Derivatives                                | 19          | 45,245      | 1           | 45,265      |\n\n## (a) Decrease in Level 3 balance was mainly due to updated pricing of less liquid bonds\n\nThe bank and corporate securities classi \u0234 ed as Level 3 at 31 December 2023 comprised mainly securities which were marked using approximations, less liquid bonds and unquoted equity securities valued based on net asset value of the investments. b",

As the Group does not hedge changes in own credit risk arising from \u0234 nancial liabilities, presenting the own credit movements within other comprehensive income does not create or increase an accounting mismatch in the income statement.\n\nThe change in fair value attributable to changes in own credit risk has been determined as the amount of change in fair value that is attributable to changes in funding spreads above benchmark interest rates. Fair value changes arising from factors other than the Group's own b credit risk are insigni \u0234 cant.\n\nThe cumulative amounts attributable to changes in own credit risk for these \u0234 nancial liabilities as at 31 December 2023 was a loss of $42 b million (2022: gain of $66 million).\n\nRealised losses attributable to changes in own credit risk as at 31 December 2023 was $22 million (2022: loss of $22 million).\n\n## 41.4 Financial assets & liabilities not carried at fair value\n\nFor \u0234 nancial assets and liabilities not carried at fair value in the \u0234 nancial statements, the Group has ascertained that their fair values were not b materially di \u038d erent from their carrying amounts at year end.\n\nFor cash and balances with central banks, due from banks, loans and advances to customers, as well as due to banks and deposits and balances from customers, the basis of arriving at fair values is by discounting cash \u0235 ows using the relevant market interest rates for the respective currencies.\n\nFor investment debt securities, subordinated term debts and other debts issued, fair values are determined based on independent market quotes, where available. Where market prices are not available, fair values are estimated using discounted cash \u0235 ow method.\n\nThe fair value of variable interest-bearing as well as short-term \u0234 nancial instruments accounted for at amortised cost is assumed to be approximated by their carrying amounts.\n\n## 42. Credit Risk\n\n## 42.1 Maximum exposure to credit risk\n\nThe following table shows the exposure to credit risk of on-balance sheet and o \u038d -balance sheet \u0234 nancial instruments, before taking into account any collateral held, other credit enhancements and netting arrangements. For on-balance sheet \u0234 nancial assets, the maximum credit exposure is the carrying amounts. For contingent liabilities, the maximum exposure to credit risk is the amount the Group would have to pay if the instrument is called upon. For undrawn facilities, the maximum exposure to credit risk is the full amount of the undrawn credit facilities granted to customers.\n\n|                                                               | The Group   | The Group   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|\n| In $ millions                                                 | 2023        | 2022        |\n| On-balance sheet                                              |             |             |\n| Cash and balances with central banks (excluding cash on hand) | 47,786      | 51,650      |\n| Government securities and treasury bills                      | 70,565      | 64,995      |\n| Due from banks                                                | 67,461      | 60,131      |\n| Derivatives                                                   | 22,700      | 44,935      |\n| Bank and corporate debt securities                            | 69,335      | 62,667      |\n| Loans and advances to customers                               | 416,163     | 414,519     |\n| Other assets (excluding deferred tax assets)                  | 17,205      | 17,416      |\n|                                                               | 711,215     | 716,313     |\n\n## O \u038d -balance sheet\n\n| Contingent liabilities and commitments (excluding capital commitments)   | 463,546   | 403,937   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Total                                                                    | 1,174,761 | 1,120,250 |\n\nThe Group's exposures to credit risk, measured using the expected gross credit exposures that will arise upon a default of the end obligor are as shown in the Group's Pillar 3 Disclosures (unaudited). These exposures, which include both on-balance sheet and o \u038d -balance sheet \u0234 nancial instruments, are shown without taking into account any collateral held or netting arrangements.\n\n## Analysis of Collateral\n\nWhilst the Group's maximum exposure to credit risk is the carrying amount of the assets or, in the case of o \u038d -balance sheet instruments, the b amount guaranteed, committed, accepted or endorsed, the likely exposure may be lower due to o \u038d setting collateral, credit guarantees and other actions taken to mitigate the Group's exposure.\n\nThe description of collateral for each class of \u0234 nancial asset is set out below.\n\n## Balances with central banks, Government securities and treasury bills, Due from banks and Bank and corporate debt securities Collateral is generally not sought for these assets.\n\n## Derivatives\n\nThe Group maintains collateral agreements and enters into master netting agreements with most of the counterparties for derivative transactions. Please refer to Note 36 for the impact of netting arrangements recognised for the computation of Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR).\n\n## Loans and advances to customers, Contingent liabilities and commitments\n\nCertain loans and advances to customers, contingent liabilities and commitments are typically collateralised to a substantial extent. In b particular, residential mortgage exposures are generally fully secured by residential properties. Income-producing real estate, which is a b sub-set of the Specialised Lending exposure, is fully secured by the underlying assets \u0234 nanced.\n\nThe extent to which credit exposures are covered by Basel eligible collateral, besides real estate, after the application of the requisite regulatory haircuts, is shown in the Group's Pillar 3 Disclosures (unaudited). The amounts are a sub-set of the actual collateral arrangements entered by the Group as Basel imposes strict legal and operational standards before collateral can be admitted as credit risk mitigants. As a result, certain collateral arrangements which do not meet its criteria will not be included. Certain collateral types which are not permitted as credit risk mitigants for credit exposures under the Standardised Approach are also excluded.",

Capital Management\n\nThe Board is responsible for setting the Group's capital management objective, which is to maintain a strong capital position consistent with regulatory requirements under the MAS Notice 637 and MAS Notice FHC-N637, and the expectations of various stakeholders, including customers, investors and rating agencies. The Board articulates this objective in the form of capital targets. This objective is pursued while delivering returns to shareholders and ensuring that adequate capital resources are available for business growth and investment opportunities as well as adverse situations, taking into consideration the Group's strategic plans and risk appetite.\n\nThe Group's capital management objective is implemented via a capital management and planning process that is overseen by the Capital Committee. The Chief Financial O \u025d cer chairs the Capital Committee. The Capital Committee receives regular updates on the Group's current and projected capital positions. A key tool for capital planning is the annual Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP) through which the Group assesses its projected capital supply and demand relative to regulatory requirements and capital targets. The ICAAP generally has a three-year horizon and covers various scenarios, including stress scenarios of di \u038d ering scope and severity.\n\nThe Group is subject to and has complied with the capital adequacy requirements set out in the MAS Notice FHC-N637, which e \u038d ects the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision's capital adequacy framework in Singapore, throughout the year. The Group's capital adequacy ratios as at 31 December 2023 and 2022 have been subject to an external limited assurance review, pursuant to the MAS Notice FHC-N609 'Auditors' Report and Additional Information to be submitted with Annual Accounts'.\n\nFor more information, please refer to the Group's Pillar 3 disclosures (unaudited) published on DBS website (https://www.dbs.com/investors/default.page).\n\n## 45. Segment Reporting\n\n## 45.1 Business segment reporting\n\nThe business segment results are prepared based on the Group's internal management reporting which re \u0235 ects the organisation's management structure. As the activities of the Group are highly integrated, internal allocation has been made in preparing the segment information. Amounts for each business segment are shown after the allocation of certain centralised costs, funding income and the application of transfer pricing, where appropriate. Transactions between segments are recorded within the segment as if they are third party b transactions and are eliminated on consolidation.\n\nThe Group's various business segments are described below.\n\n## Consumer Banking/ Wealth Management\n\nConsumer Banking/ Wealth Management provides individual customers with a diverse range of banking and related \u0234 nancial services. The b products and services available to customers include current and savings accounts, \u0234 xed deposits, loans and home \u0234 nance, cards, payments, investment and insurance products.\n\n## Institutional Banking\n\nInstitutional Banking provides \u0234 nancial services and products to institutional clients including bank and non-bank \u0234 nancial institutions, government-linked companies, large corporates and small and medium-sized businesses. The business focuses on broadening and deepening customer relationships. b Products and services comprise the full range of credit facilities from short-term working capital \u0234 nancing to specialised lending. It also provides global transactional services such as cash management, trade \u0234 nance and securities and \u0234 duciary services, treasury and markets products, corporate \u0234 nance and advisory banking as well as capital markets solutions.\n\n## Treasury Markets\n\nTreasury Markets' activities primarily include structuring, market-making and trading across a broad range of treasury products.\n\nIncome from sale of treasury products o \u038d ered to customers of Consumer Banking/ Wealth Management and Institutional Banking is not re \u0235 ected in the Treasury Markets segment, but in the respective customer segments.\n\n## Others\n\nThe Others segment encompasses the results of corporate decisions that are not attributed to business segments. It includes earnings on capital deployed into high quality assets, earnings from non-core asset sales and certain other head o \u025d ce items such as centrally-managed credit allowances. DBS Vickers Securities is also included in this segment.",

Please refer to page 97 of the Capital Management and Planning section in the 2023 Annual Report for an explanation of DBSH's dividend policy.\n\n## Ordinary Resolution 3:\n\n## Non-executive Directors' remuneration for 2023\n\nResolution 3 is to approve the payment of an aggregate amount of SGD 4,790,622 as remuneration for the non-executive Directors of the Company for the year ended 31 December 2023 ('FY2023'). If approved, each of the non-executive Directors (with the exception of Mr Ho Tian Yee and Mr Chng Kai Fong) will receive 70% of his or her Directors' fees in cash and 30% of his or her Directors' fees in the form of share awards granted pursuant to the DBSH Share Plan.

The actual number of shares to be awarded will be determined by reference to the volumeweighted average price of a share on the SGX-ST over the 10 trading days immediately prior to (and excluding) the date of the forthcoming AGM, rounded down to the nearest share, and any residual balance will be paid in cash. The Director's fees for Mr Ho Tian Yee, who retired from office by rotation at the 24 th Annual General Meeting held on 31 March 2023 and did not offer himself for re-election, will be paid to him in cash. The Director's fees for Mr Chng Kai Fong will be paid in cash to a government agency, the Directorship & Consultancy Appointments Council.\n\nPlease refer to pages 43, 44, 58 and 59 of the Corporate Governance Report in the 2023 Annual Report for more details on the nonexecutive Directors' remuneration for FY2023.\n\n## Ordinary Resolutions 5, 6 and 7: Re-election of Directors retiring under Article 99\n\n(a) Mr Piyush Gupta, upon re-election as a Director of the Company, will remain as an executive Director of the Company.\n\n- (b) Mr Chng Kai Fong, upon re-election as a Director of the Company, will remain as a member of each of the Audit Committee, Nominating Committee and Board Sustainability Committee. Mr Chng is considered non-independent of the substantial shareholder as he is a senior civil servant. Mr Chng is a non-executive Director and has no management or business relationships with the Company.\n- (c) Ms Judy Lee, upon re-election as a Director of the Company, will remain as a member of each of the Audit Committee, Board Risk Management Committee/ BRMC Technology Risk Committee, Compensation and Management Development Committee and Board Sustainability Committee, and will be considered independent.\n\n## Ordinary Resolution 8: Re-election of Director retiring under Article 105\n\nMr David Ho Hing-Yuen, upon re-election as a Director of the Company, will remain as a member of each of the Audit Committee, Compensation and Management Development Committee and Board Sustainability Committee, and will be considered independent.\n\n## Special Business\n\n## Ordinary Resolution 9: Share Issue Mandate\n\nResolution 9 is to empower the Directors to issue shares of the Company and to make or grant instruments (such as warrants or debentures) convertible into shares, and to issue shares in pursuance of such instruments, up to a number not exceeding in total 50% of the total number of issued shares (excluding treasury shares and subsidiary holdings) of the Company, of which the number of shares that may be issued other than on a pro rata basis to shareholders must not exceed 10% of the total number of issued shares (excluding treasury shares and subsidiary holdings).\n\nFor the purpose of determining the aggregate number of shares that may be issued, the percentage of issued shares shall be based on the total number of issued shares (excluding treasury shares and subsidiary holdings) of the Company at the time that Resolution 9 is passed, after adjusting for (a) new shares arising from the conversion or exercise of any convertible securities or share options or vesting of share awards which were issued and are outstanding or subsisting at the time that Resolution 9 is passed; and (b) any subsequent bonus issue, consolidation or subdivision of shares. As at 7 February 2024 (the 'Latest Practicable Date'), the Company had 8,475,490 treasury shares and no subsidiary holdings.\n\n## Ordinary Resolution 10: DBSH Scrip Dividend Scheme\n\nResolution 10 is to empower the Directors, should they choose to apply the DBSH Scrip Dividend Scheme (the 'Scheme') to a qualifying dividend, to issue such number of new ordinary shares of the Company as may be required to be issued pursuant to the Scheme to members who, in respect of a qualifying dividend, have elected to receive scrip in lieu of the cash amount of that qualifying dividend. If the Directors should decide to apply the Scheme to a qualifying dividend, the current intention is that no discount will be given for the scrip shares.\n\n## Ordinary Resolution 11:\n\n## Renewal of the Share Purchase Mandate\n\nResolution 11 is to renew the mandate to allow the Company to purchase or otherwise acquire its issued ordinary shares, on the terms and subject to the conditions set out in the Resolution.\n\nThe Company may use its internal or external sources of funds or a combination of both to finance its purchase or acquisition of the ordinary shares of the Company ('Ordinary Shares'). The amount of financing required for the Company to purchase or acquire its Ordinary Shares, and the impact on the Company's financial position, cannot be ascertained as at the date of this Notice as these will depend on, inter alia , the number of Ordinary Shares purchased or acquired and the price at which such Ordinary Shares were purchased or acquired.\n\nBased on the existing issued and paid-up Ordinary Shares as at the Latest Practicable Date and excluding any Ordinary Shares held in treasury, the purchase by the Company of 2% of its issued Ordinary Shares will result in the purchase or acquisition of 51,582,842 Ordinary Shares.\n\nAssuming that the Company purchases or acquires 51,582,842 Ordinary Shares at the Maximum Price, in the case of both market and off-market purchases, of SGD 33.48 for one Ordinary Share (being the price equivalent to 5% above the average closing prices of the Ordinary Shares traded on the SGX-ST over the last five market days on which transactions were recorded immediately preceding the Latest Practicable Date), the maximum amount of funds required is approximately SGD 1.7 billion.\n\nThe financial effects of the purchase or acquisition of such Ordinary Shares by the Company pursuant to the proposed Share Purchase Mandate on the financial statements of the Group and the Company for the financial year ended 31 December 2023 based on these and other assumptions are set out in paragraph 2.7 of the Letter to Shareholders dated 6 March 2024 (the 'Letter').\n\nPlease refer to the Letter for further details.",
