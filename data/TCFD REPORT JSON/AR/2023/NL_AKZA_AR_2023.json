        "page_content": "## CEO STATEMENT\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2023 was a year in which AkzoNobel delivered a clear rebound in performance after a disappointing 2022. Our volumes stabilized -despite continuing volatility in some of our markets -our profits rebounded on resilient pricing and the first effects of raw material deflation, while our efforts to transform our company gathered pace. This allowed us to absorb persistent global inflation and unfavorable currency effects to beat the targets we'd set ourselves at the beginning of the year.\n\nMost of our end markets seemed to bottom out in the second half of 2023, and some areas actually showed robust growth trends. This was true for our Powder Coatings business, which recovered well in the second half of the year from a construction-driven downturn. Results for Decorative Paints in EMEA (Europe, Middle East and Africa) reflected a stabilization in volumes and continuing pricing power, while Deco in China grew volumes in a more challenging pricing environment. Our Coatings businesses in China performed well throughout.\n\nFor our Industrial Coatings business, metal coatings markets (coil, packaging) stabilized globally after a tough start to the year, which left wood coatings as the main segment under continuing volume pressure. Finally, stalwarts such as Aerospace Coatings, Marine and Protective Coatings and Vehicle Refinishes - which benefit from strong macro trends - continued to perform well.\n\nProgress on margin management was a key contributor to our performance, as we demonstrated discipline and\n\nstickiness with our pricing. Raw materials were a headwind in the first half of the year as we traded out expensive inventory, but this trend reversed in the second half and we expect it to continue until at least the first half of 2024. With regard to operating expenses, driving down costs in response to inflation was a key priority on which we delivered, in line with our target set at the beginning of 2023. This helped us absorb persistent global inflation and finished goods write-offs as we cleaned up our inventories, while delivering almost \u20ac300 million (+24%) more adjusted EBITDA than in 2022, despite close to \u20ac100 million of adverse currency effect.\n\nWe also demonstrated cash discipline, with strong collection and a firmer grip on our inventories as we continue to drive working capital back down towards normative levels of around 13% of revenue. The combination of higher profits, working capital management and the decision to not proceed with the Kansai Paints Africa transaction allowed us to be significantly ahead of our deleveraging targets by the end of 2023, at 2.7x net debt to EBITDA - well on our way to our normative level of around 2x which we intend to retain in the mid-term.\n\nWe also took decisive action to unlock the significant value we can gain by improving our industrial operations. An industrial excellence plan is underway, focused on reducing complexity, improving capacity utilization and investing in the modernization of our sites. We believe there's significant value to be gained, as indicated by our \u20ac250 million incremental profit ambition, and this plan is a key long-term strategic priority for us. You can read more about it in the Strategy pages.\n\nIn August, we completed the acquisition of the Huarun business in China. The renowned decorative paints brand has a long history and is well recognized. The transaction will further boost our position in the region, enable further market segmentation and reinforce our position outside of the premium segment.",

        "page_content": "Meanwhile, the integration of the Grupo Orbis activities we acquired last year continued to gather pace, with 2023 being the first year that the Colombia-based organization fully contributed to the results of our business in Latin America. As noted earlier, we opted not to proceed with the Kansai Paints Africa transaction, directing our efforts towards the integration of recent acquisitions and enhancing our balance sheet to regain capital allocation flexibility.\n\nSustainability and innovation remained high on the agenda, highlighted by the launch of several pioneering products designed to help our customers become more efficient and reduce their carbon emissions. These included Interpon D1036 Low-E - a low-energy architectural powder coating - and a new generation of fast-drying fillers for vehicle bodyshops introduced by our Sikkens and Lesonal brands.\n\nWe also showcased our digital capability, as illustrated by the Aerofleet Coatings Management system, which uses drones to help airlines and operators optimize their maintenance schedules. And we continued to invest to\n\nensure we remain a paints and coatings industry sustainability leader. This was highlighted by the groundbreaking at our Vilafranca site in Spain, where we're building a new plant to produce coatings for the metal packaging industry that are free of intentionally added bisphenols.\n\n2023 was a year in which companies who don't invest in their people suffered, as job markets around the world tightened, creating a real battle for talent. At AkzoNobel, we continued our efforts to be an employer of choice through the launch of our new employee engagement platform, Voices. Upon its introduction, Voices achieved a global participation rate of 89% and a level of engagement that far surpassed the industry norms. We're processing the flow of insights we gained to help us identify areas for improvement and empower employees and managers to create an even better work environment where everyone can thrive.\n\nLooking ahead to 2024, we'll still be living in an inflationary world with some macro-economic uncertainty. However, we have good momentum and\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDuring a visit to the US in 2023, our CEO met Keddra Doss, a production operator at our manufacturing plant in Pontiac, Michigan. It was one of several site visits that were made during the year to meet colleagues and become more familiar with activities at our locations around the world.\n\nwe expect to resume growing volumes while delivering further margin - and profit - expansion. We don't expect our industrial excellence plan to contribute significantly to this in 2024, as these structural actions involve a lot of up-front work, but it will boost our performance beyond 2024.\n\nOn behalf of the entire Executive Committee, I want to thank you, our shareholders, customers, partners and other stakeholders for your support throughout 2023. In particular, I want to thank the company's teams around the world for all their efforts. Our people continued to demonstrate their passion and commitment and I'm proud to work with them hand-in-hand as we take AkzoNobel to the next level.",

        "page_content": "HOW WE CREATED VALUE\n\n## Financial overview\n\nRevenue was 5% higher in constant currencies (reported revenue -2%). Revenue growth in constant currencies was mainly due to pricing, with volumes flat for the year. Acquisitions added 2%, primarily related to Grupo Orbis. Other, which mainly relates to hyperinflation accounting, reduced revenue by 1%.\n\nOperating income increased 45% to \u20ac1,029 million (2022: \u20ac708 million), with a rebound in gross margins more than offsetting operating cost inflation. Currency effects from translation were negative \u20ac77 million, mainly driven by the Argentinian peso and Turkish lira.\n\nOperating income includes identified items of negative \u20ac45 million (2022: negative \u20ac81 million), mainly related to restructuring and acquisition-related costs, partially offset by gains on property divestments.\n\nAdjusted operating income increased 36% to \u20ac1,074 million (2022: \u20ac789 million). ROS improved to 10.1% (2022: 7.3%).\n\nFor business results, refer to Strategy and operations.\n\n## Sustainability progress\n\nWe're focused on ensuring that the pioneering paints and coatings we supply today can help safeguard our world far beyond tomorrow. We innovate with and for customers and play a progressive and collaborative role in energizing entire industries to advance towards a more sustainable future.\n\nDuring 2023, we made further progress towards our 2030 key sustainability ambitions. This progress is highlighted in charts throughout this section and further detailed in the Sustainability statements.\n\n## Financing income and expenses\n\nFinancing income and expenses amounted to negative \u20ac272 million (2022: negative \u20ac124 million). The \u20ac148 million increase in net expenses largely results from an increase of net interest on net debt of \u20ac36 million, \u20ac36 million negative result on hedging contracts - related to the previously anticipated acquisition of Kansai Paints Africa, for which cash flow hedge accounting was applied before - and an increase of \u20ac49 million due to the combined impact of exchange rate differences and hyperinflation accounting.\n\n## Income tax\n\nThe effective tax rate was 37.8% (2022: 35.5%). The high effective tax rate in 2023 is mainly the result of the items below, which together increased the tax rate by 8.7%:\n\n- \u00b7 The derecognition of deferred tax assets due to the reassessment of technical tax limitations to deduct interest (increase of the effective tax rate by 5.5%)\n- \u00b7 Hyperinflation accounting (increased the effective tax rate by 3.2%)\n\n## Shareholders' equity\n\nShareholders' equity amounted to \u20ac4.3 billion at December 31, 2023, compared with \u20ac4.3 billion at yearend 2022. Main movements relate to profit for the period of \u20ac442 million, dividend of \u20ac338 million and actuarial losses of \u20ac111 million (net of taxes).\n\n## ENVIRONMENTAL\n\n38%\n\n2023\n\nCarbon emission reduction\n\nOwn operations (baseline 2018, absolute)\n\n9%\n\n2023\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Carbon emission reduction value chain\n\nScope 3 emissions, selected Scope 3 upstream and downstream (baseline 2018, absolute)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n62%\n\n2023\n\n## Renewable electricity\n\nOf total electricity used in own operations\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n7%\n\n30 %\n\n2023\n\n2030 ambition\n\n## Energy reduction\n\nBaseline 2018 (of total energy used in own operations, relative)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n55%\n\n2023\n\n2030 ambition\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Circular use of materials\n\nThe amount of materials (in own operations) reused by AkzoNobel and third parties\n\n<!-- image -->",

The weighted average number of shares for 2023 was 170.6 million shares.\n\nThe weighted average number of shares excludes shares bought back in 2022, for as long as they were not cancelled, which was realized by the end of the first quarter. The weighted average number of shares is the basis for the calculation of earnings per share.\n\n## Cash flow and net debt\n\nNet cash from operating activities was an inflow of \u20ac1,126 million (2022: inflow of \u20ac263 million). The increased cash flow was mainly driven by a decrease in working capital and increased operating income.\n\nNet cash from investing activities was an outflow of \u20ac144 million (2022: outflow of \u20ac1,095 million); the 2022 outflow included an increase in short-term investments and the payment for the acquisition of Grupo Orbis.\n\nNet cash from financing activities was an outflow of \u20ac827 million (2022: inflow of \u20ac309 million). The increase in outflow is mainly related to a higher outflow from changes from borrowings. In addition, 2022 included the impact from the share buyback.\n\nAt December 31, 2023, net debt was \u20ac3,785 million versus \u20ac4,089 million at year-end 2022, mainly due to net cash generated from operating activities (\u20ac1,126 million), offset by dividends paid (\u20ac368 million) and capital expenditures (\u20ac286 million). The net debt/EBITDA leverage ratio at December 31, 2023, was 2.7 (December 31, 2022: 3.8).\n\n## Dividend\n\nThe dividend policy remains unchanged and is to pay a stable to rising dividend. The final 2022 dividend of \u20ac1.54 per common share was approved at the AGM on April 21, 2023, which resulted in a total 2022 dividend of \u20ac1.98 per share (2021: \u20ac1.98).\n\nIn 2023, an interim dividend of \u20ac0.44 was paid (2022: \u20ac0.44). A final 2023 dividend of \u20ac1.54 (2022: \u20ac1.54) per common share is proposed.\n\n## Invested capital\n\nInvested capital at year-end totaled \u20ac7.8 billion, down \u20ac0.3 billion from year-end 2022. This decrease was mainly caused by lower inventories, due to the combined impact of lower raw material prices, currency impact and lower volumes.\n\n## Operating working capital\n\nOperating working capital (trade) was \u20ac1.5 billion at December 31, 2023 (December 31, 2022: \u20ac1.8 billion). Operating working capital (trade) as a percentage of revenue was 15.1% at year-end 2023, compared with 16.9% at year-end 2022, mainly due to lower inventories.\n\n## Pensions\n\nThe net balance sheet position (according to IAS19) of the pension plans at year-end 2023 was a surplus of \u20ac0.7 billion (year-end 2022: surplus of \u20ac0.7 billion). The development during 2023 was mainly the result of the net effect of lower discount rates in key countries, offset by demographic assumption gains in the UK.",

        "page_content": "## DECORATIVE PAINTS\n\n## 2023 OVERVIEW\n\nOur much-improved results reflected a stabilization in volumes following the turbulent macro-economic climate. Despite some demand headwinds, overall performance was better than we'd anticipated entering the year - a testament to the strength of our brands and market positioning. Across our three geographical regions, volumes in Asia began to rebound as painting activity in China increasingly benefited from the shift towards renovation - and away from new-build - changing the market mix to our advantage.\n\nDecorative Paints revenue in constant currencies was up 6% on 2022, mainly due to pricing initiatives in response to continued inflation. Volumes were flat on the previous year. The acquisition of the Huarun business in China, completed in August 2023, contributed 2%. Unfavorable exchange rates were a considerable headwind, reducing revenue by 7%. Including the impact of currency effects,\n\nreported revenue was 1% lower.\n\nAdjusted operating income of \u20ac500 million represented an increase of 27% on the previous year. Return on sales expanded by 260 basis points to 11.6%. Inflationarydriven pricing benefited profitability, while the procurement of lower priced raw materials began to benefit our Decorative Paints business in the second half of the year. The rebound in gross margin was partially offset by inflationary pressure on operating expenses. Operating income of \u20ac500 million was 29% higher than 2022.\n\nDecorative Paints is comprised of businesses that focus on a full range of interior and exterior decoration and protection products for both the professional and do-it-yourself channels. These include paints, lacquers and varnishes, as well as products for surface preparation. We also offer services such as mixing machines, color concepts and advice, along with training courses for applicators. AkzoNobel operates its own sales distribution network in addition to selling through agents and distributors.\n\n## Revenue in \u20ac millions\n\n|                                  | 2022 1   | 2023   | \u2206%   | \u2206% CC 2   |\n|----------------------------------|----------|--------|------|-----------|\n| Decorative Paints EMEA           | 2,405    | 2,413  | -%   | 4%        |\n| Decorative Paints Latin  America | 767      | 780    | 2%   | 19%       |\n| Decorative Paints Asia           | 1,172    | 1,107  | (6%) | 2%        |\n| Total                            | 4,344    | 4,300  | (1%) | 6%        |\n\n- 1 Revenues for 2022 have been updated to reflect changes in the financial reporting structure.\n- 2 Change excluding currency impact.\n\n## Key financial figures\n\n| in \u20ac millions/%               | 2022   | 2023   | \u2206%   |\n|-------------------------------|--------|--------|------|\n| Adjusted EBITDA 3,4           | 548    | 645    | 18%  |\n| Operating income 3            | 388    | 500    | 29%  |\n| Adjusted operating income 3,4 | 393    | 500    | 27%  |\n| OPI margin (%) 3,4            | 8.9%   | 11.6%  |      |\n| ROS (%) 3,4                   | 9.0%   | 11.6%  |      |\n| Average invested capital 4    | 3,677  | 3,755  | 2%   |\n| ROI (%) 3,4                   | 10.7%  | 13.3%  |      |\n\n- 3 Operating income and adjusted operating income (and related measures) for 2022 have been updated to reflect changes in the financial reporting structure.

        "page_content": "EMEA: An incremental recovery in consumer confidence helped market demand for our products stabilize during 2023, despite uncharacteristically wet weather in Western Europe during the first half. Volumes were slightly lower versus the previous year, although we expect a progressive rebound in market demand in Europe toward 2019 levels over the coming years. Overall, channel inventories in our key markets have normalized.\n\nLatin America: Market challenges, including the impact of high inflation and exchange rate volatility, persisted into 2023. Demand patterns between quarters were driven by pricing distortions, while overall volumes were soft. This was the first year that Grupo Orbis fully contributed to our results, following completion of the acquisition part-way through 2022. During the course of the year, the Decorative Paints brands of Grupo Orbis adopted our distinctive Flourish identity, with the new brand image preserving the traditional names of Pintuco and Protecto, which have been established for more than 70 years.\n\nAsia: We achieved mid-single digit volume growth following a rebound in our China activities. Demand trends in China were mixed, with strong sales at the beginning of the year tapering out as market demand softened. Dulux continued to expand its geographical presence, and the acquisition of the Huarun business in China is expected to provide further access to distribution channels in the country's tier three to tier five geographical areas. The Huarun brand has a long history, is well recognized in China and will reinforce our position outside of the premium segment, bringing further market segmentation to our portfolio. Trends in South East and South Asia were broadly positive, albeit with differences across countries, in line with broader macro-economic trends. Demand in India remained robust, while Vietnam experienced softer market conditions because of a financing and real-estate market contraction.\n\nWe launched a new project in EMEA designed to help us double the size of our eCommerce and digital business over the next three years. Focused on enabling eFulfilment capability, the project involves sending individual packages direct to the door of end-consumers. Many of our key retail customers have started operating these dropship models to enable them to sell a larger range - it's a way of selling products online without the need to keep them in stock. This is a key benefit for the retailer and enables AkzoNobel to sell wider ranges online, driving incremental sales revenue. The markets launched to date include the UK, France, Spain and Germany. The Benelux - which currently uses a local system - will be added to the scalable EMEA solution in 2024.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur Dulux Professional Weathershield Express two-coat system for exteriors was specified for use on all new Housing and Development Board apartments built in Singapore. The product has been proven to increase productivity by up to 30% (compared with three-coat systems), resulting in time savings of up to 20% and material consumption reductions of up to 15%. An estimated 50,000 apartments will be created across 2024 and 2025.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## PERFORMANCE COATINGS\n\n## 2023 OVERVIEW\n\nOur Performance Coatings activities benefited from a gradual recovery in many segments during 2023, leading to much improved financial performance. Volumes were flat on the previous year, with growth in a number of our lower volume end markets offset by continued weakness in some of our higher volume end markets. Overall, volumes remained below 2019 levels.\n\nRevenue in constant currencies was up 4% on 2022, with a strong contribution from pricing discipline. We also benefited from an improving mix, with a return to growth in our aerospace, automotive and marine and protective end markets, while demand in our high-volume Industrial Coatings businesses remained soft. Unfavorable exchange rates were a considerable headwind, reducing revenue by 6%. Including the impact of currency effects from translation, reported revenue was 2% lower.\n\nPowder Coatings started its rebound in the second half of the year, while Marine and Protective Coatings continued to benefit from strong customer order books. In Industrial Coatings, coil and packaging improved after a tough first half, while wood remained depressed.\n\nAdjusted operating income of \u20ac685 million represented an increase of 38% on 2022. Return on sales expanded by 320 basis points to 10.8%. Profitability was driven by a combination of the purchase of lower priced raw materials - which began to generate benefits in Q2 - and pricing. The rebound in gross margin was partially offset by inflationary pressure on operating expenses. Operating income of \u20ac698 million was 56% higher than 2022.\n\nAkzoNobel is one of the world's leading manufacturers and suppliers of performance coatings. Our products are engineered to achieve functional properties such as corrosion control, fouling control, anti-scratch and passive fire protection, while delivering step changes in sustainability. Our Performance Coatings activities are organized into four main businesses: Automotive and Specialty; Industrial; Marine and Protective; and Powder Coatings. Key end markets include general industrials (agricultural and construction equipment, construction-related steel and metal fabrication, pipes, appliances and transportation), energy, packaging, infrastructure and shipbuilding and maintenance.\n\n## Revenue in \u20ac millions\n\n|                                    | 2022 1   | 2023   | \u2206%    | \u2206% CC 2   |\n|------------------------------------|----------|--------|-------|-----------|\n| Powder Coatings                    | 1,385    | 1,377  | (1%)  | 6%        |\n| Marine and Protective  Coatings    | 1,389    | 1,482  | 7%    | 13%       |\n| Automotive and Specialty  Coatings | 1,407    | 1,422  | 1%    | 6%        |\n| Industrial Coatings                | 2,318    | 2,087  | (10%) | (3%)      |\n| Total                              | 6,499    | 6,368  | (2%)  | 4%        |\n\n- 1 Revenues for 2022 have been updated to reflect changes in the financial reporting structure.\n- 2 Change excluding currency impact.\n\n## Key financial figures\n\n| in \u20ac millions/%                | 2022   | 2023   | \u2206%   |\n|--------------------------------|--------|--------|------|\n| Adjusted EBITDA 3,4            | 668    | 854    | 28%  |\n| Operating income 3             | 448    | 698    | 56%  |\n| Adjusting operating income 3,4 | 497    | 685    | 38%  |\n| OPI margin (%) 3,4             | 6.9%   | 11.0%  |      |\n| ROS (%) 3,4                    | 7.6%   | 10.8%  |      |\n| Average invested capital 4     | 3,895  | 3,725  | (4%) |\n| ROI (%) 3,4                    | 12.8%  | 18.4%  |      |\n\n- 3 Operating income and adjusted operating income (and related measures) for 2022 have been updated to reflect changes in the financial reporting structure.

        "page_content": "## PERFORMANCE COATINGS\n\nPowder Coatings: Having been impacted by industrywide challenges during 2022, the first half of the year saw a continuation of challenging conditions. Architectural end markets showed signs of a recovery in the second half of the year. Performance in our automotive end markets and electric vehicle-related applications were solid. Driven by its strong sustainability characteristics, liquid-to-powder conversion continued to gather pace across many end markets, with our technology leadership in lower temperature curing positioning us well for future growth. The December 2022 acquisition of the wheel liquid coatings business of Lankwitzer Lanckfabrick GmbH also delivered synergies.\n\nMarine and Protective Coatings: In our Performance Coatings portfolio, Marine and Protective Coatings achieved the strongest growth, fueled by a multi-year recovery in markets driven by sustainability. The improvement was most prominent within our Protective Coatings activities. The continued rebound of our Marine Coatings business was also notable on the back of a strong brand proposition, technical expertise and a focus on sustainability. Meanwhile, we re-established our presence in the new-build marine market in Asia, focusing on technical ships, where our high-performance Intersleek systems provide true differentiation. Intersleek is a biocidefree foul release solution which delivers fuel and emissions savings for owners and operators and helps to support the industry's decarbonization ambitions. In Yacht, volumes normalized following a number of buoyant years of customer demand in the recreational boating segment.\n\nAutomotive and Specialty Coatings: We achieved good volume performance in our aerospace and automotive end markets as customers continued to work through elevated backlogs. Consumer electronics end markets, on the other hand, experienced continued weakness, although volumes sequentially improved throughout the year. Volume performance in our Vehicle Refinishes business was mixed between regions, with North America comparatively stronger than Europe. Overall, the Vehicle Refinishes business continued its revenue growth path, driven by pricing efforts and multiple wins at bodyshop level.\n\nIndustrial Coatings: Volumes declined during the year, with the Wood Coatings business in particular being impacted by lower activity in residential housing in North America and Europe. Coil Coatings rebounded in Europe after energy prices stabilized, while China returned to growth, driven by market activity and market share gains. In Packaging Coatings, the impact of destocking was largely contained to the first half of the year, with sequentially improving volumes during the full year indicating a normalization in customer inventories. During 2023, we launched Accelshield 700, our internal coating for beverage can ends that is free of intentionally added bisphenols. This product completes our full-can offering and will help customers meet the surge in demand for safer and more sustainable coatings, supporting our leading market position. The new product also integrates easily into customers' existing manufacturing processes, with limited disruption.\n\nThe eye-catching Tech Eagle livery on this Embraer E195-E2 jet was brought to life by MAAS Aviation. They used more than 14 different colors supplied by our Aerospace Coatings business. It's the sixth time we've worked on animal-themed livery with Embraer, having previously provided coatings for equally impressive eagle, tiger, shark, snow leopard and tech shark designs.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe supplied KIA Motors with its first ever bio-based interior coating, which is being used on its new EV9 electric SUV. Developed by our Automotive and Specialty Coatings business, it features two kinds of bio-rosin.\n\n<!-- image -->",

We're driven to find innovative, more sustainable solutions for our customers, communities and the planet. We innovate to help make the world better, safer, more sustainable - and more colorful. From saving energy, absorbing heat and protecting and beautifying assets, to making ships go faster, lighting brighter and air cleaner, our world class reputation for pushing boundaries can be found in every layer of paint.\n\n## Transforming our generation\n\nThe paints and coatings industry can play an important role in decarbonizing industries globally. As an innovation leader, we're working on a 50% reduction in carbon emissions by 2030 for the whole value chain (baseline 2018, absolute) - a commitment that's been validated by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi). In 2023, our Scope 3 emissions reduced by 9% (baseline 2018).\n\nThe size and scale of this challenge requires the transformation of our generation. What's required in particular is a more collaborative approach, based on the realization that each contributor will need to innovate changes which will lead to carbon reduction at various points in the chain. A key enabler of transformation is our Paint the Future program, the largest collaborative innovation ecosystem in the industry. It's a bold initiative to accelerate, test, launch and scale ideas and sustainable solutions for the paints and coatings industry.\n\nIn addition to our ambitious carbon reduction targets, we support a circular economy and aim to provide our customers with competitive, sustainable solutions that are free from harmful substances. Our areas of innovation include the use of bio-based materials, water-based paints and the phasing out of hazardous materials (see Sustainable solutions in the Sustainability statements).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n'In this era of rapid change in our industry, decarbonization is the core challenge. Collaboration is our strongest ally in creating a sustainable future.'\n\nRoger Jakeman Chief Technology Officer\n\nDuring 2023, we continued to deliver on our innovation priorities. Our collaborative innovation network is underpinned by a number of initiatives and actions:\n\n- \u00b7 The Advanced Research Center Chemical Building Blocks Consortium (ARC CBBC) envisions a greener, more sustainable chemical industry. We're proud to collaborate with industry, academia and government stakeholders to advance this mission\n- \u00b7 We've partnered with the Universities of Manchester and Sheffield in the UK for a project that will fundamentally examine 'how paint works'. Sustainable Coatings by Rational Design (SusCoRD) will give us a clear understanding of how the performance of protective organic coatings arises\n- \u00b7 The EU-funded VIPCOAT program is an open innovation platform which aims to help engineers develop coatings. We're among 12 partners from seven countries who have joined forces to make developing and producing corrosion protection technologies faster, increasingly sustainable and more economical\n- \u00b7 Our latest Paint the Future Collaborative Sustainability Challenge was launched. It involves partners from across the vehicle repair value chain developing a shared approach to tackle carbon reduction\n\nOptimal management of coatings systems can also help to achieve cost and energy savings, which is why we're supporting our customers with digital and sustainable solutions:\n\n- \u00b7 Our Aerospace Coatings business developed a new digital system - Aerofleet Coatings Management. It enables airlines and operators to optimize the paint maintenance schedules for their entire fleets\n- \u00b7 Bodyshops can now take advantage of a new generation of fillers from our Sikkens and Lesonal vehicle refinishes brands, which help to significantly improve productivity while lowering energy costs\n- \u00b7 Launched an openly accessible online energy savings calculator for all powder coatings users\n\nIn this fast-paced era of the paints and coatings industry, the central challenge is decarbonization. To tackle this, collaboration is our best ally. We're joining forces by combining our expertise and innovative know-how to create a more sustainable future for the industry.\n\n## Innovation in numbers\n\n<!-- image -->",

It's about pushing boundaries and finding inventive ways to collectively make a positive contribution to our ever-changing world.\n\nThis will be vital if we're to realize our science-based target of halving carbon emissions in our value chain by 2030. It's one of several ambitions we have for 2030 (shown below), which stem from our three main areas of focus climate change, circularity, and health and well-being:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nless carbon emissions in our own operations and across the value chain (baseline 2018)\n\ncircular use of materials in own operations driven by reduce, reuse, recycle\n\nof revenue from sustainable solutions\n\nmembers of local communities empowered with new skills\n\nOur Director of Sustainability, Wijnand Bruinsma, gave presentations in several countries during the year, when he outlined our approach and how we're working across the value chain to achieve our ambitions.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe put particular emphasis and investment into our sustainable solutions, so our game-changing portfolio of innovative products and technologies is always expanding. This is guided by five key drivers: reduced energy and carbon; less waste; reduce, reuse and renew; health and well-being; longer lasting.\n\n- By looking beyond the surface and radically rethinking paints and coatings, we can color people's lives and protect what matters for generations to come.\n\n## ESG ratings and benchmarks\n\nWe constantly monitor our progress to ensure we remain on the right track and work hard to maintain our high standards with leading rating agencies, such as Sustainalytics, EcoVadis and MSCI. This independent acknowledgement recognizes our ambitious targets and programs and our sustainability leadership in our industry. We annually review the benchmarks we actively participate\n\nin, taking into account stakeholder preference, such as investors, suppliers and customers. We prioritize active participation in those benchmarks that help drive continuous improvement and rely mostly on publicly available information. We're proud that we remained a frontrunner in the paints and coatings industry throughout 2023, based on the following ESG rating agencies and benchmarks.\n\n| ESG rating  agency   | Key achievements                                                                                                                                                       |\n|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| EcoVadis             | Our commitment has earned us our highest ever  rating from EcoVadis - 82/100 - placing us in the  top 1% of companies assessed across all industries  around the world |\n| MSCI                 | Maintained highest possible rating (AAA) for eight  consecutive years                                                                                                  |\n| Sustainalytics       | Maintained ESG top-rated assessment                                                                                                                                    |\n| FTSE4Good            | We featured in the FTSE4Good Index Series for the  18th year running.

This Report 2023 has also been prepared to align with the format and requirements of the upcoming CSRD. However, it's not yet fully compliant with the CSRD.\n\nThe Sustainability statements of Akzo Nobel N.V. are prepared on a consolidated basis. The scope of the consolidation is equal to the scope of consolidation for the Financial statements, with the exception of associates and recent acquisitions, as explained below.\n\nIn general, our aim is to report acquisitions and (de)mergers or other similar transactions from the date of transaction. However, as onboarding and training takes time, there is often a delay between closing of a transaction and integration into sustainability reporting. For 2023, the data related to the recent acquisition of the Huarun business in China, as well as the Lankwitzer business, is not included. The 2023 data includes the acquisition of Grupo Orbis, except for the KPI of Suppliers in sustainability program and SpeakUp! data. For the KPI Sustainable solutions, we extrapolated for the impact of Grupo Orbis, as well as the acquisition of the Huarun business in China. For more information, see Sustainable solutions.\n\nThe material impacts, risks and opportunities connected to our value chain have been assessed as part of our double materiality assessment (see Impact, risk and opportunity management). For KPIs added in anticipation of CSRD, see Changes in preparation or presentation versus prior periods. A description of the double materiality process is included in Impact, risk and opportunity management.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe indicators that fall within the scope of limited assurance of the external auditor for 2023 are marked with u The Limited assurance report of the independent\n\nauditor, which includes details on scoping and outcomes, is available on page 184. In light of our preparation towards CSRD, we've added several disclosures for 2023 versus the previous year, which are not yet in scope of the assurance engagement.\n\nDue to our alignment with the upcoming CSRD, we no longer claim GRI compliance for 2023 and aim to embed the TCFD framework in our climate change disclosure. For a detailed description of the reported KPIs, we refer to the Reporting Principles Sustainability statements 2023.\n\n## Preparation of CSRD implementation\n\nAs we're preparing for implementation of the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD), this year's Sustainability statements have been structured in the following order:\n\n- \u00b7 General disclosures, including basis of preparation, governance, strategy and our approach to double materiality\n- \u00b7 Environmental disclosures, including our approach to climate change, waste and water management and our sustainable product portfolio\n- \u00b7 Social disclosures, including those related to the health and well-being of our own people, such as diversity and safety, as well as workers in our value chain\n- \u00b7 Governance disclosures\n\n## Time horizons\n\nThe reporting period that is applicable to the Sustainability statements is equal to the reporting period for the financial statements, except for Scope 3 emissions for 2023. This reported KPI relates to the period from October 1, 2022, until September 30, 2023.\n\n## Sources of estimation and outcome uncertainty\n\nThe preparation of the Sustainability statements requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported. The estimates\n\nand assumptions are based on experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. The KPIs Sustainable solutions and Scope 3 carbon footprint have a higher degree of judgement and complexity for which changes in the assumptions and estimates could result in different results than those recorded in the Sustainability statements in this Report 2023.\n\n## Value chain estimation\n\nFor the calculations of our Scope 3 emissions, we make use of estimations by means of industry averages. The database used to retrieve the industry averages are the CEPE (the European Council of the Paint, Printing Ink and Artist's Colours Industry) and Ecoinvent databases (see Climate change for more details). Replacing industry average data to calculate the Scope 3 emissions attributed to our suppliers with supplier specific carbon footprint data is a key driver to improve our data quality. For 2023, 5.5% of our total Scope 3 carbon footprint (which equates to 11.8% of our total upstream emissions) was calculated using supplier specific data.\n\n## Changes in preparation or presentation versus prior periods\n\nFor 2023, there were changes to the preparation and presentation compared with previous periods, as we changed the format of the Sustainability statements to align with the upcoming CSRD requirements. As a result, the Sustainability statements are aligned with the Environmental, Social and Governance presentation requirements of the CSRD. The content is matched to the CSRD standards to allow for a reporting foundation for preparation towards 2024 disclosures, as the first mandatory reporting year. Several metrics have been added versus the previous year to already disclose available metrics and targets required under CSRD.",

        "page_content": "|\n\n|\n\nSeveral metrics have been materially changed or eliminated compared with 2022:\n\n- \u00b7 Organizational Health Index (OHI): During 2023, we implemented a new employee engagement tool, called Voices, which helps us better respond to the demands of the organization. This means OHI is no longer measured and reported\n- \u00b7 Greenhouse gas emissions Scope 2: Definition and measurement changed to allow for market and location based reporting in preparation for CSRD (see Climate change)\n- \u00b7 For Sustainable solutions, the 2022 percentage has been restated from 40% to 39% to change the reporting period from November 2021 - October 2022 to January 2022 to December 2022\n\n## Reporting adjustments related to prior periods\n\nReporting errors in prior periods, the methodology changes eligible for restatement and, where applicable, other changes, are restated in the current reporting period. Where this is the case, we indicate this through an explanatory footnote. For 2023, this was the case for the following KPIs:\n\n- \u00b7 A notification of a fine imposed by the UK authorities in December 2022, in response to a process safety incident in 2020 at our Felling site, came in too late to include in the annual report for 2022. As a result, the RA4 number for 2022 is adjusted from 0 to 1\n- \u00b7 We found waste reporting irregularities for 2022 at two of our manufacturing sites because of misinterpretations of waste stream definitions, leading to restatements for non-reusable waste (30 to 32 kilotons) and non-reusable waste per ton of production (9.68 to 10.25 kg/t) and hazardous waste non-reusable (17 to 18 kilotons) and hazardous waste non-reusable per ton of production (5.36 to 5.82 kg/t). The irregularities also impacted the following other waste KPIs: percentage circular use of materials; total waste; reusable waste; hazardous waste; nonhazardous waste; and their relative per ton of\n\n- production figures. These impacts are also restated for 2022\n- \u00b7 A baseline adjustment was made for the KPI Scope 3 carbon footprint. The inclusion of Grupo Orbis had a significant impact on our Scope 3 carbon footprint, for which we adjusted the baseline and the previous year. In addition to adjusting our Scope 3 carbon footprint for the Grupo Orbis acquisition, we also developed new key value chain models for Powder Coatings, as well as raw material model revisions. The new Powder Coatings model was developed with an external consultant and allowed us to future proof our customer use phase model to also cover our newly developed low-E product line. The 2018 and 2022 numbers have also been adjusted, since the new model uses a different approach compared with the previous model. For our raw material modeling, we've carefully assessed the assumptions used in our modeling of the materials we purchase, leading us to note that for some materials, more accurate matches could be found within the current models. We were able to trace these model changes back to 2018, allowing us to adjust the baseline for all years since. The model changes were thorough, giving us confidence that future model changes will not be material. The total effects of the Grupo Orbis acquisition, the Powder Coatings model revisions and the raw material model revisions on our 2018 baseline and 2022 comparative figures are included in the table below\n\n## Incorporation by reference\n\nSome disclosures are incorporated by reference, for example for diversity in the Supervisory Board, the description of business and markets served and ESG in remuneration. Wherever we incorporate information by reference (to other parts of the management report), this is clearly indicated.\n\nOur architectural powder coatings customers can now benefit from an industry-first product which cures at temperatures as low as 150 \u00b7 C. Interpon D1036 Low-E can also cure up to 25% faster than conventional powders, which cure at 180 \u00b7 C. Whatever option customers prefer, they can both cut energy consumption by as much as 20%.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Adjustments Scope 3 carbon emission reporting in million tons CO2(e)\n\n|                 |   Reported  historically |   Grupo Orbis adjustment |   Powder Coatings  model revisions |   Raw material model revisions |   Restated in 2023 |\n|-----------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|------------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------|\n| 2022            |                     13.2 |                      0.5 |                               -0.3 |                            0.1 |               13.5 |\n| 2018 (baseline) |                     14   |                      0.5 |                               -0.2 |                            0.2 |               14.5 |",

In addition, the oversight of impacts, risks and opportunities by the management and supervisory bodies is also included in that section.\n\nThe Executive Committee is responsible for incorporating our sustainability agenda into the company strategy and monitoring the performance of each business through the Operational Control Cycle, as described in the Corporate governance statement. Given our focus on sustainability, overall ownership of sustainability is with the CEO. Sustainability is on the agenda for the Supervisory Board on a quarterly basis. Separately, the Audit Committee is kept up to date with sustainability reporting developments. More information, including on the topics discussed, can be found in the Report of the Supervisory Board and the Corporate governance statement.\n\n## Integration of sustainability-related performance in incentive schemes\n\nGoals related to ESG aspects are included in the longterm incentive (LTI) performance targets for the Board of Management. A detailed breakdown of the targets, including the 2023 performance, is also included in the Remuneration report.\n\n## Statement on due diligence\n\nWe perform due diligence for sites that we acquire or divest. The outcomes of our due diligence processes with regard to sustainability matters inform us of our material impacts, risks and opportunities. The identification, prevention, mitigation and reporting of these actual and potential impacts is embedded in the way we conduct business.\n\nIncluded below is a description of the specific due diligence processes in relation to human rights and environmental due diligence. For the due diligence process performed to determine our material impacts, risks and opportunities, see Impact, risk and opportunity management.\n\n## Human rights due diligence\n\nAs part of our core principles, we're committed to respecting internationally recognized human rights in all our operations and throughout our value chain. This commitment is in line with the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGPs) and the International Labor Organization (ILO) Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work. Embedding a continuous human rights due diligence process to determine a company's salient human rights issues is at the core of the UNGPs. In 2021, we finalized our second in-depth global salient human rights issues assessment\n\n(see results in table below). While we respect all human rights equally, we prioritized certain issues based on severity and likelihood. This has resulted in the previously mentioned salient human rights issues for us to focus on and conduct further due diligence, in line with our considerations as shared in our Report 2021. Results of our ongoing due diligence are used to update our global salient human rights issues assessment every year. Some of these issues - after those due diligence results - have also been identified as a material topic under the CSRD's double materiality assessment. For other topics, further due diligence in the future will determine their materiality.\n\nIn addition, we operate continuous topic-specific due diligence processes that help us identify (potential) human rights impacts, on which we both engage and communicate. For example, our Health, Safety, Environment and Security (HSE&S) audits assess the health and safety conditions at our manufacturing sites. Another example is our Supplier Sustainability Framework, which includes assessments, surveys and audits of our high-risk suppliers, and is designed to identify and assess sustainability practices, including human rights, in our supply chain.\n\nFurther information on our salient human rights issues, our related due diligence activities and mitigating and remediating measures (for example, related to conflict minerals) can be found in the relevant sections in the Social disclosures in the Sustainability statements.\n\n## Salient human rights assessment\n\n|                                      | Upstream supply  chain   | Own operations   | Logistics   | Downstream  (customers, end-users)   |\n|--------------------------------------|--------------------------|------------------|-------------|--------------------------------------|\n| Health and safety                    | \u00b7                        | \u00b7                | \u00b7           | \u00b7                                    |\n| Working conditions                   | \u00b7                        | \u00b7                | \u00b7           | \u00b7                                    |\n| Discrimination and harassment        |                          | \u00b7                |             |                                      |\n| Negative impact on local communities | \u00b7                        | \u00b7                |             |                                      |\n| Modern slavery                       | \u00b7                        |                  | \u00b7           |                                      |",

We have environmental due diligence processes in place for both acquisitions and divestments.\n\nThese processes are usually carried out in collaboration with a third-party specialist in the form of:\n\n- \u00b7 HSE&S due diligence for overarching Health, Safety, Environment and Security-related topics\n- \u00b7 Phase 1 and 2 environmental site assessments for soil and groundwater-related topics. This process is generally carried out against (inter)national standards in place\n\n## Risk management and internal controls over sustainability reporting\n\nFor a general description of our risk and internal control processes, refer to the Risk management section.\n\nInternal controls related to sustainability reporting are dependent on the area of reporting, as multiple internal functions contribute to our sustainability reporting, depending on the topic. The majority of reported KPIs are prepared by our HSE&S and HR functions. At consolidated level, control measures are in place to ensure accurate and complete reporting on ESG-related metrics as part of our annual report.\n\nIn 2023, we started to prepare a roadmap for the pathway towards reasonable assurance readiness for our sustainability KPIs, which includes the development of a CSRD compliant control framework as from 2024.\n\nAn industry-first online energy savings calculator was launched by our Powder Coatings business in Europe.

This is a subset of C20 - Manufacture of chemicals and chemical products. AkzoNobel's operations are grouped into two main businesses: Paints and Coatings. For a description of our business model, strategy and key markets served, see Strategy and operations.\n\nFor a breakdown of headcount by geographical area, as well as revenue by destination, please refer to the Regional statistics in the Financial summary.\n\n## Interaction with strategy and goals related to product groups\n\nThe key elements of our strategy that relate to sustainability are: moving to 50% of revenue from sustainable solutions by 2030, and halving carbon emissions across our value chain by 2030 (baseline 2018). Both targets relate to how we formulate, market and sell our products and will impact the way we interact with our suppliers and customers over the coming years. As the majority of our emissions take place outside of our own operations, collaborating with our suppliers and customers is key to achieving our ambitions. More details can be found in Climate change and Sustainable solutions.\n\n## Interests and views of stakeholders\n\nIn line with the Dutch Corporate Governance Code 2022, we've published a Stakeholder Engagement Policy, which is available on our website. As detailed in the policy, our key stakeholders are customers, employees, governments and policy makers, industry associations and other partners, investors, suppliers and wider society.\n\nThe views of these stakeholders shape our strategic decision-making process. As part of our double materiality assessment, we also consulted with representatives from these key stakeholder groups on sustainability-related impacts, risks and opportunities.\n\n## IMPACT, RISK AND OPPORTUNITY MANAGEMENT\n\n## Material impacts, risks and opportunities and their interaction with strategy and business model\n\nWe assessed the impacts, risks and opportunities on environmental, social and governance matters and how these interact with our strategy and business model. This assessment is based on internal and external stakeholder engagement for both impact and financial materiality. It results in an overview of our material impacts, risks and opportunities throughout our value chain.\n\nFor details on the material risks, impacts and opportunities, we refer to the separate disclosures as included in the Environmental, Social and Governance chapters. Details on the process steps taken in the double materiality assessment are included in the next paragraph. A mapping from the material risks, impacts and opportunities to the associated European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRSs) disclosure requirements will be included in our Report 2024.\n\n## Description of the process to identify and assess material impacts, risks and opportunities\n\nOur risk assessment process to identify and assess material impacts, risks and opportunities for ESG-related topics is structured in line with the requirements of CSRD.\n\nIn 2023, we performed a baseline of our assessment in preparation for CSRD. The outcomes serve as a basis for an updated double materiality assessment which is to be performed in 2024. Below we provide a description of the process steps taken to prepare the assessment.\n\nIn the first step of the double materiality assessment, we gathered and analyzed background research on potentially material topics to AkzoNobel. For this, we reviewed different sources:\n\n- \u00b7 ESG raters, including their view on material topics for our broader sector and our specific sector, as well as our suppliers and their respective industries\n- \u00b7 Sustainability reports of peers, as well as value chain partners, such as suppliers and customers\n- \u00b7 The outcomes of our salient human rights issues due diligence process\n- \u00b7 Previous years' impact materiality assessments\n\nThis input shaped our view on the landscape of potentially material environmental, social and governance impacts, risks and opportunities for AkzoNobel.\n\nDuring the second phase, we organized several workshops with internal subject matter experts, with the aim of rating and calibrating the potential and actual impacts, risks and opportunities (IROs) for all topics included in the CSRD 1 .\n\nIn the workshops, we rated the IROs on severity (scale, scope and irremediability) and likelihood. This assessment was split per value chain area (upstream, own operations",

We validated the assessment with internal stakeholders (management teams of subject matter experts involved) and the CSRD Steering Committee. The Executive Committee validated our double materiality assessment during 2023 and the Audit Committee and Supervisory Board were informed about the process and outcome.\n\nSubsequently, the shortlist of topics has been validated with our external stakeholders, both potentially impacted stakeholders, as well as users of the information.\n\nWe will annually review the double materiality assessment and update our material impacts, risks and opportunities based on the outcomes of this review. Every three years, we aim to perform a thorough double materiality assessment, unless an event triggers an early reassessment, for example larger acquisitions or divestments.\n\nThe resulting material topics and the reference to the relevant section in the Sustainability statements are included in the table on the next page.\n\nIn addition to the material topics mentioned above, we've identified a number of topics related to either legal requirements or other relevant matters. The topics related to legal requirements mainly consist of reporting requirements on human rights due diligence and diversity and inclusion. Other relevant matters are those which we deem necessary to understand the organizational context AkzoNobel is operating in, and which we consider to be elementary for organizations with our size and impact.\n\nBecause these topics are not considered material as a result of the initial double materiality assessment for CSRD, the related disclosures will not necessarily comply with the related CSRD requirements when implementing CSRD. The related disclosures will primarily consist of our policies and procedures in place.\n\n## Double materiality assessment outcome 2023\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Other relevant topics\n\n<!-- image -->",

Our assessment showed both Climate change mitigation, as well as adaptation, to be assessed as material topics for AkzoNobel - the former for our full value chain and the latter for our own operations.\n\n## Governance\n\nOur carbon emission reduction ambition has been approved by our Board of Management and reviewed by our Supervisory Board. AkzoNobel is not excluded from the EU Paris-aligned Benchmarks.\n\n## Our approach to climate change mitigation\n\nWe've established that climate change could affect our supply chain, our customers and our operations. In 2021, we announced an ambition to reduce carbon emissions across our full value chain by 50% by 2030, taking 2018 as our baseline.\n\nOur ambitions are aligned with the Paris Agreement, which aims to limit climate change and ensure the global temperature doesn't rise more than 1.5\u02daC above preindustrial levels. Approved by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi), our ambitions will help to drive our innovation and collaboration with our value chain partners, including customers and suppliers.\n\nOur commitment includes our own operations (Scope 1 and 2), as well as Scope 3 upstream and downstream. Scope 3 covers purchased goods and services (category\n\n## Carbon emissions reduction Scope 1 and 2\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1 in the GHG protocol), application and use of our products (categories 10 and 11, including VOC emissions), and end-of-life (category 12). Our Scope 3 ambition covers around 95% of our total Scope 3 emissions.\n\n## Climate change mitigation in own operations\n\nTo achieve our ambition of reducing our carbon footprint in our own operations by 50% by 2030 (Scope 1 and 2, baseline 2018), we have a clear decarbonization strategy (see waterfall chart above). This strategy will be further developed in 2024.\n\n## First key lever Scope 1 and 2 emission reduction: Energy efficiency\n\nThe first key decarbonization lever for our Scope 1 and 2 emissions is reducing the amount of energy we consume. We're aiming to reduce our relative energy consumption by 30% by 2030 (baseline 2018) and plan to do so through an ambitious 5% year-on-year reduction objective.\n\nWe've identified several programs to help us achieve this:\n\n- \u00b7 Operational excellence that will apply energy management to our daily operations and reduce our energy use in production, warehouses and offices\n- \u00b7 Upgrading inefficient assets such as chillers, air compressors and furnaces to best-in-class and improve HVAC systems for our buildings and warehouses",

We also have a renewable electricity target of 50% for 2025 and 100% for 2030. We purchase Renewable Electricity Certificates or Guarantees of Origin and actively look for off-site power purchasing agreements (PPAs) where possible.\n\nLooking ahead to 2050, we'll start working on new reduction levers that will help us towards our carbon neutral targets. For example, by decarbonizing our fuels through electrification of thermal processes and by using biofuels in our boilers and furnaces.\n\nThe company's first solar energy plant in Brazil was inaugurated at our Recife plant. A total of 1,580 panels have been installed, which will supply nearly 30% of the location's electricity requirements. It marked another important step towards achieving our ambition of reducing carbon emissions in our own operations by 50% by 2030.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe carbon footprint in our value chain in % of contribution to overall carbon footprint\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Upstream and downstream operations: Scope 3 emissions\n\nFor Scope 3, we're taking action by increasing our sustainable product offering, by innovating for the development of new sustainable solutions and by engaging with our suppliers and customers around the world to collectively find solutions towards our target of halving carbon emissions in our value chain by 2030. Collaboration with our value chain partners is key to collectively decarbonize.\n\nDuring 2023, we continued to integrate sustainability and innovation into our daily business to work towards our ambitions.\n\n## Four key levers for Scope 3 reduction\n\nWhen it comes to reducing carbon emissions across our value chain, we've identified four key levers that should help us achieve the 50% reduction. These levers are: Energy transition; Process efficiency; Reduced solvent emissions; and Circular solutions. Projects related to our Scope 3 reduction are grouped under these four key levers. Although we believe it's important to set strong Scope 3 ambitions, we've not yet disclosed detailed plans for 2030 to 2050. As we focus our efforts towards halving our emissions by 2030, the plans we've put in place to support our Scope 3 carbon emission reduction levers serve as a base for continued decarbonization post-2030.\n\n## Energy transition\n\nUnder this lever, we group all carbon reduction opportunities that result from energy transition in the paints and coatings value chain. Many of our suppliers and customers are setting targets for decarbonization themselves, moving to renewable electricity and cleaner sources of powering their processes. This is increasingly leading to growing availability of raw materials with a reduced carbon footprint. Through our projects and programs on energy transition, we aim to offer our customers lower carbon footprint solutions.",

        "page_content": "ENVIRONMENTAL\n\n## Process efficiency\n\nThis lever focuses on providing our customers with the most efficient solution in terms of carbon footprint. Many of our coatings customers use gas to cure our products. By collaborating on developing coatings that require less energy to cure, we can offer our customers products that can help lower their carbon footprint and save energy costs. In our Automotive and Specialty Coatings business, demand for ambient and UV curing coatings - which don't require gas to cure - is rising. We're looking to collaborate with customers and advise them on carbon reduction strategies for their coating processes, thereby becoming the partner of choice for carbon conscious customers.\n\n## Reduced solvent emissions\n\nRelease of solvents from our products is a key part of our Scope 3 emissions, which means reduction of solvent emissions represents a key reduction lever. Projects in this area are focused on reducing the carbon footprint of customers who apply our products that contain VOCs. This can be done by switching to water-based products, flat reduction of solvents in our formulations and by thinking along with customers to capture and oxidize the solvents we supply to them, which can be a key area for the application of renewable solvents.\n\n## Circular solutions\n\nThis lever focuses on reducing the end-of-life impact of the fossil-based materials in our products. This can mainly be achieved by increasing the amount of renewable materials in our formulations, which can be done through applying bio-based, biomass balanced and recycled materials, among others.\n\nWe're actively running carbon reduction projects throughout the company in these key focus areas, and have set up a governance structure to ensure they're embedded in future plans, such as our R&D pipeline and supplier engagements.\n\n## Supplier engagement\n\nWe actively engage with our suppliers to share our ambitions and encourage these key stakeholders to do the\n\nsame. Key impact areas for suppliers are: increasing process efficiency; moving to renewable energy; and reducing the use of fossil materials and fuels. We also see more intensive collaboration with suppliers on developing new innovative solutions as a key driver towards reducing our full value chain carbon footprint. We held in-depth discussions with more than ten key suppliers on how their plans can support our ambition and how we can collaborate to close any gaps. We're continuing to work together on joint programs with key suppliers to achieve further carbon reduction in our full value chain.\n\nIn 2023, Together for Sustainability (TfS) launched the Product Carbon Footprint (PCF) Guideline to ensure a consistent measure of carbon emissions along the value chain in the chemical industry and beyond. We fully support this new global guidance and encourage our suppliers to join us in using it as a way of identifying collaborative opportunities. To support the secure and trustworthy exchange of PCF data throughout the chemical supply chain, TfS is piloting a PCF data-sharing solution (using Siemens' 'Sigreen' software). The PCF data-sharing solution allows chemical companies to request PCF information from their suppliers on purchased materials. We were involved in piloting the solution during 2023. If successful, this solution will be used to collect PCF information from our suppliers in an efficient way, on a larger scale.\n\nDuring the year, we also increased the scope of suppliers participating in our Supplier Sustainability Balanced Scorecard (SSBS) program to almost 100 suppliers, representing 80% of our upstream carbon emissions. We request product carbon footprint, waste, energy and greenhouse gas emission information, to monitor progress versus our suppliers' sustainability goals. The SSBS helped us hold constructive meetings and discussions with our suppliers to better understand their plans and challenges. The results of these meetings serve as input for our strategy and decision-making processes. For more information on how we work with our suppliers, see Supplier management.\n\n## Progress year-end 2023: Scope 3\n\nOur 2023 Scope 3 carbon footprint was down 3% from 2022 (from a rounded 13.5 million tons in 2022 to a rounded 13.1 million tons in 2023). This was driven by lower purchased volumes and improvements in our portfolio, such as more water-based solutions, as well as more specific carbon footprint data from suppliers. As the development of new solutions, investments in the value chain and market acceptance takes time, we expect the majority of the reduction of our Scope 3 carbon footprint towards the latter part of the decade.\n\n## Climate change adaptation\n\nPotential climate change adaptation risks are included in our risk assessment processes, both in our own operations and in our value chain. During 2023, we performed a desktop study with the help of Zurich Insurance Group, assessing all our manufacturing sites (~130), as well as a selection of ~50 key supplier locations with regards to physical climate risks.\n\nTo determine criticality, the total insured value was used for own locations and total spend value for supplier locations. Our analysis focused on the high and very high hazard levels across our portfolio, under different climate scenarios and future time horizons. The climate scenarios used were SSP2-4.5 (middle road) and SSP5-8.5 (fossil fuel development) and the time horizons were 2030 (near term) and 2050 (mid-long term).\n\nLocations were analyzed for multiple natural hazards related to climate change, some of which have a higher inherent physical risk to our operations than others. In scope were: precipitation, thunderstorms, wind, heat, flood, drought, wildfire, cold waves and hail. A multi-peril ranking was produced to identify the locations with the highest exposure to climate change as a whole. The outcome of this assessment will be used as a basis for further analysis around climate risk management with internal and external stakeholders (e.g. for future resilience planning and climate-related reporting). This detailed analysis and potential mitigating actions will commence in 2024.",

For the last eight years, we've implemented an internal carbon price for these investment decisions, anticipating the impact of any future carbon pricing. Annually, we quantify the potential transitional risk impact of any global carbon taxation by multiplying our carbon footprint (Scopes 1 and 2) with the internal carbon price. To analyze different potential scenarios, we calculate the impact using a carbon price ranging from \u20ac50 to \u20ac150 (per ton), the latter being the suggested UN price on carbon. That range results in an impact well below 1% of 2023 revenues. Our suppliers and customers might be impacted by carbon pricing, which creates both risks and opportunities. For example, we can mitigate the carbon cost impact for our customers by offering sustainable solutions.\n\n## Transition risks: Long-term trends\n\nWe further analyzed potential transition risks during a longterm trends workshop held in 2023. As part of these longterm trends, environmental transition risks were considered, including, but not limited to, climate change.\n\nThe top five transition risks are included below:\n\n- \u00b7 The lack of availability of (precious) raw (e.g. biobased) materials slowing down the use of more sustainable raw materials and more sustainable products\n- \u00b7 Infrastructure limitations (e.g. electricity network capacity) hindering us from reaching our sustainability objectives\n- \u00b7 Changing legislation (sustainability-driven product or environmental legislation) impacting the company's ability to achieve strategic objectives and its ability to move production (different requirements in different countries/regions)\n- \u00b7 Divergence between societal scrutiny and legislation, leading to shifting customer and investor expectations\n\n- \u00b7 Risk of increased divergence in the trade-off between increased demand for recyclability and inherent longlasting aspects of our products\n\n## GHG emission reduction targets: Scope and methodology\n\nWe have a target of 50% carbon emission reduction for Scope 1 and Scope 2 by 2030 (baseline 2018, absolute) and a target of 50% carbon emission reduction for Scope 3 by 2030 (baseline 2018, absolute). This is validated by the Science Based Targets initiative and is in line with a 1.5\u02daC scenario.\n\n## Breakdown Scope 1 and 2\n\nOur GHG emissions under Scope 1 are spread over the fuels we use at our sites, with natural gas being the largest contributor. The material emissions from Scope 2 are almost all related to our non-renewable electricity, with only some sites purchasing steam and hot water from external suppliers.\n\n## 2023 Scope 1, 2 Energy and GHG footprint\n\n| Scope 1                    | Fuel equivalent (TJ)   | GHG (kTCO2eq/yr)   |\n|----------------------------|------------------------|--------------------|\n| Natural gas                | 887.5                  | 49.8               |\n| Fuel oil                   | 90.9                   | 6.7                |\n| LPG                        | 43.7                   | 2.7                |\n| Biomass                    | 4.1                    | 0.0                |\n| Total                      | 1026.2                 | 59.2               |\n| Scope 2                    | Fuel equivalent (TJ)   | GHG (kTCO2eq/yr)   |\n| Electricity  renewable     | 2,959.2                | 0.0                |\n| Electricity non- renewable | 1,845.7                | 116.3              |\n| Steam import               | 32.4                   | 1.8                |\n| Hot water import           | 54.7                   | 2.3                |\n| Total                      | 4,892.0                | 120.4              |\n\n## Breakdown Scope 3\n\nOur 50% (absolute) reduction ambition for 2030 encompasses the following categories, covering around 95% of our total Scope 3 emissions:\n\n- \u00b7 Upstream: Category 1 (purchased goods and services, including packaging)\n- \u00b7 Downstream: Category 10 and 11 (application and use of sold products), VOC emissions and Category 12 (end-of-life)\n\n## Energy consumption reduction and solar energy\n\nFor 2023, our absolute energy consumption (own operations) reduced 4% versus 2018 and our relative energy consumption reduced by 7% versus 2018. Compared with 2022, our absolute energy consumption remained stable (compensating for the Grupo Orbis acquisition), while our relative energy consumption was 6% down compared with 2022.\n\nMany energy efficiency measures were taken at our sites in 2023, and we're now seeing the results of those initiatives. Another contributing factor for our improved energy efficiency was increased production volumes at some of our sites. The relatively mild winter in some regions may also have influenced our energy use.\n\nThe graphs below and on the next page show our regional energy split and energy use, absolute and relative, in 1,000 TJ.\n\n## Regional split energy use in %\n\n<!-- image -->",

The renewable electricity certificates were purchased in the Americas and Europe and equaled our electricity consumption during the year; no balance nor remaining obligation to purchase remained at year-end. This resulted in a total renewable electricity percentage of 62% at the end of 2023 (2022: 50%), well on track towards our target of 100% by 2030 and already achieving our 2025 interim target of 50%. We also transitioned to 100% renewable electricity at all our manufacturing sites in North America at the start of 2023. Currently, 3% of our consumed electricity is produced at our sites. Generating renewable electricity on-site alleviates pressure on the electricity grid and further reduces our carbon footprint. In total, 82 of our locations now use 100% renewable electricity and 31 locations are using solar panels as a supplementary source of energy. We've currently installed about 30% of our solar on-site potential, and have a healthy pipeline of projects for the coming years.\n\n## Gross Scopes 1, 2, 3 and total GHG emissions\n\n## Scope 1 and 2 emissions\n\nOur combined Scope 1 and 2 emissions decreased by 38% versus our 2018 baseline (absolute). We've already achieved our 2025 interim ambition of reducing our carbon footprint for our own operations by 25% versus our 2018 baseline. Compared with 2022, we reduced carbon emissions by 13% in 2023 (absolute), mainly through purchasing renewable electricity for our North America and Latin America regions, and improved energy efficiency. The reported carbon emissions includes our acquisition of sites in Latin America in 2023 (as part of the Grupo Orbis acquisition). From a relative perspective, our Scope 1 has reduced 8% since 2018, while our Scope 2 carbon emissions reduced by 48%.\n\n## Direct CO2 (Scope 1) in kilotons\n\n|   2018 |   2019 |   2020 |   2021 |   2022 |   2023 |\n|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n|   62.9 |   58.3 |   57.2 |   64.5 |   60.1 |   59.2 |\n\nFor the reporting year 2023, we aligned our Scope 2 reporting with the CSRD reporting requirements and have started reporting location versus market-based.

Currently, we don't perform or purchase any offsetting activities for our GHG emissions and we don't make use of carbon removals or storage in our own operations.\n\n## Potential financial effects from material physical and transition risks and potential climate-related opportunities\n\nThe potential effects on the financial statements of climate change have been assessed. This includes the impact of physical risks, such as those associated with water scarcity, flooding and weather events, as well as transitional risks that can lead to changes in technology, market dynamics and regulations. A desktop study was performed relating to these physical climate risks. Also considered were AkzoNobel's commitments to reduce carbon emissions, as approved by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi), and related estimates as to investments and the timing thereof. The resulting impact on the financial statements, including in the areas of fixed assets depreciation and recoverability assessments, was not deemed material to the company's financial position and results of operations as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n\nFurther potential financial effects from material climaterelated risks are currently being assessed and, where applicable, will be included in our annual report going forward.",

No continuous emitting processes are operated and emissions that occur are mostly related to gas consumption emissions. The material topic of priority substances will be included in this section for 2024.\n\n## Pollution of air\n\nThe production and use of solvent-based paints and coatings causes emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). These emissions are included in our cradle-tograve carbon footprint. Compared with 2022, our relative\n\nWater flow in million m 3 (total for AkzoNobel)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nVOC emissions per ton of product remained stable for our own operations, and reduced by 45% versus the 2018 baseline.\n\nWe're reducing VOC emissions in a number of distinct ways. Firstly, we implement abatement technologies such as thermal oxidizers or activated carbon filters, for example at our Chilseo site in South Korea. Secondly, we reduce our footprint by concentrating solvent-based production in more efficient or automated factories, to reduce VOC emissions. For example, we transferred 800 tons of solvent-based paints out of our Montataire site in France, which now only produces water-based paint. In addition, we're actively working on transitioning from solvent-based to water-based solutions where possible.\n\n## WATER AND MARINE RESOURCES\n\n## Materiality\n\nOur approach to determining our material impacts, risks and opportunities is described in General disclosures. For water and marine resources, the material topics identified are Water consumption and Water withdrawals for our water intensive sites in water scarce areas. Both material topics only apply to our own operations.\n\n## Water use and consumption in own operations\n\nWe concentrate our water consumption reduction efforts at our water intensive sites in water scarce areas.\n\nThe bulk of our water use is for cooling (74% in 2023). Water is also used as a raw material in paints and coatings and for cleaning. We define a water intensive site as one that consumes more than 15,000m 3 per year. This excludes cooling water and includes water related to product. Water scarce areas are determined per the Aqueduct water risk atlas developed by the World Resources Institute, in line with previous years. Those sites that are located in water scarce areas and are water intensive are expected to meet our target of less than 250 liters of relative fresh water consumption per ton of product. As per our internal, best-in-class benchmark analysis, a site that consumes less than 250 liters per ton of product produced is considered to have water reuse measures in place.",

For Circular economy, we identified Resource inflows and outflows (circularity) as a material topic throughout the value chain, as well as Waste for our own operations.\n\n## Policies, actions and resources related to resource use and circular economy\n\n## Own operations\n\nWe're on a journey towards achieving 100% circular use of materials in our own operations by 2030. To get there, we're focused on reducing the amount of waste and increasing the circular use of materials. In line with our\n\nstrategy of reducing, reusing and recycling materials, our material optimization process focuses on diverting slowmoving and obsolete materials (SLOBs) from scrapping to internal reuse and third-party recyclers and outlets. We drive waste reduction through multi-disciplinary collaboration between our commercial teams, supply chain, manufacturing, HSE&S, our innovation teams and third parties.\n\n## Upstream\n\nOne of our goals in becoming more circular is to use at least 50% recycled content in the plastic packaging used by our Decorative Paints Europe business by 2025.\n\nBy collaborating with our packaging suppliers, we've been able to achieve up to 70% recycled content in our key packs, without increasing the packaging weight or reducing its performance. In 2022, we updated most packs in the UK - our largest European market - and have further worked towards the roll-out in mainland Europe. In 2023, 77% of the plastic packaging contained recycled content, which means we're on track to transform the remainder by our 2025 target.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Downstream\n\nMoving towards a circular economy means reducing waste and increasing circularity throughout our value chain. We're driven by reduce, reuse and renew, while our products seek to protect and make surfaces and materials last longer. In fact, three of the sustainability criteria used to assess our product portfolio are directly linked to circularity. See Sustainable solutions to learn more about our approach to building a sustainable product portfolio.\n\n## Key resource outflows\n\n## Waste management own operations\n\nWe continue to drive improvements in our own operations, with numerous waste reduction initiatives having been carried out in 2023. For example, we made further efforts to improve the efficiency, and increase the number of our solvent recovery units, which helps to increase the amount of recovered and reused solvents that would otherwise be disposed of as waste.\n\nIn addition, we further improved the management of SLOBs. This resulted in an increased amount of SLOBs sold to our preferred outlet partners, which otherwise would have been disposed of as waste.\n\nWe aim for 100% circular use of materials by 2030 for our manufacturing sites. In 2023, we achieved circular use of materials for 55% of our obsolete material and waste streams (2022: 54% 1 ). The limited increase is explained by a steeper reduction in our reusable waste in relation to our non-reusable waste.\n\nOur relative waste (kg per ton of material produced) reduced by 2% overall, not (yet) meeting our annual internal goal of 5%.\n\n1 Restated for 2022, refer to Basis of preparation for further details.",

Overall, we've reduced waste to landfill by 48% (absolute) versus the 2018 baseline.\n\n## ENTITY SPECIFIC DISCLOSURES\n\n## Sustainable solutions\n\nWe identified our sustainable product portfolio as a key opportunity for AkzoNobel.\n\nIn 2020, we set an ambition to increase revenue from sustainable solutions to more than 50% by 2030. We consider sustainable solutions to be those that bring tangible sustainability benefits to our customers, and market demand for them is growing. By identifying the sustainable solutions in our portfolio, we can engage in a more collaborative way with our customers - many of whom have set their own sustainability targets.\n\nBy focusing on the sustainability benefits we offer, we continue to influence the growing acceptance of more sustainable solutions in our markets. We work closely with our suppliers and customers to deliver these products and services, while ensuring economic value at every stage.\n\nWe use the Sustainable Product Portfolio Assessment (SPPA) framework to identify the sustainability value we bring to our customers. The SPPA framework is based on the World Business Council for Sustainable Development's (WBCSD) Portfolio Sustainability Assessment, which we co-developed with other chemical companies. It's now the leading sustainable portfolio framework tool in the chemical industry. The SPPA gives a holistic view of the sustainability characteristics of our product portfolio. Together with our customer-focused product stewardship process, it helps us tailor value-selling strategies to specific customer needs. By taking this harmonized approach to our portfolio management, we're able to create a unique baseline for future portfolio ambitions.\n\nOur products fall into one of three categories: Sustainable solutions, Performers or Transitioners. A sustainable solution is a product that brings one or more sustainability\n\nbenefits to our customers, as defined by the sustainability criteria illustrated below, without having an adverse effect on the other criteria. In 2023, 39% (2022: 39%) of our revenue came from sustainable solutions. For 2022, the percentage of revenue that came from sustainable solutions has been restated to reflect the period from January 1, 2022, until December 31, 2022, instead of November 1, 2021, until October 31, 2022, as reported in our Report 2022. During the year, we launched new products with clear sustainability benefits and further reduced the use of certain priority substances, in line with our strategy.\n\nIn 2023, more product management teams were trained on the use of the SPPA, resulting in an increased understanding of the methodology and awareness of the potential sustainability benefits of our product portfolio. The SPPA for Grupo Orbis hasn't yet been finalized. This is due to a lack of data availability and incompleteness, as it takes a significant amount of time to complete the full portfolio analysis. The coverage of the SPPA remained stable compared with the previous year (~80% of revenue), with the remainder, including Grupo Orbis, extrapolated based on the sustainable solutions' revenue percentage of the relevant business unit.

Contribute substantially to one or more of six environmental objectives, being:\n- -Climate change mitigation\n- -Climate change adaptation\n- -Sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources\n- -Transition to a circular economy\n- -Pollution prevention and control\n- -Protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems\n- 2. Do no significant harm to any of the other environmental objectives\n- 3. Be carried out in compliance with minimum (social) safeguards\n- 4. Comply with technical screening criteria\n\nThe technical screening criteria specify the performance requirements for any economic activity that determine under what conditions that activity makes a substantial contribution to a given environmental objective and does not significantly harm the other objectives. For the financial year 2023, all six objectives listed above have been further detailed out and are applicable for reporting. Companies are required to report on the proportion of turnover (revenues), capital expenditures (CapEx) and operating expenditures (OpEx) that's associated with environmentally sustainable economic activities, and to what extent these activities are aligned (i.e. contributing to one or more environmental objectives).\n\nThe key performance indicators relevant under EU taxonomy are turnover, CapEx and OpEx. For the purpose of the calculation of eligible activities, the following financial\n\ninformation has been derived from AkzoNobel's Consolidated financial statements:\n\n- \u00b7 Turnover under EU taxonomy is equal to consolidated external revenues as reported in our Consolidated statement of income, amounting to \u20ac10,668 million\n- \u00b7 CapEx under EU taxonomy is the sum of additions in property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and right-of-use assets from both investments and acquisitions resulting from business combinations, amounting to \u20ac488 million. CapEx as included in the Consolidated financial statements under the Consolidated cash flow statement amounting to \u20ac286 million excludes the impact from additions to right-ofuse assets of \u20ac109 million, as well as the impact from acquisitions resulting from business combinations of \u20ac93 million. Additions to right-of-use assets are included in the movement schedule on right-of-use assets, as included in Note 12 of the Consolidated financial statements. The impact from acquisitions is included in the movement schedules on Intangibles and Property, plant and equipment, as included in Note 10 and Note 11 respectively\n- \u00b7 OpEx is calculated in accordance with the EU taxonomy as direct non-capitalized costs incurred for the day-to-day servicing of assets, consisting of research and development costs, short-term leases, maintenance and repair costs and other similar costs, amounting to \u20ac395 million. This definition differs from OpEx as included in our Consolidated statement of income\n\nAkzoNobel's core activity, manufacturing paints and coatings (NACE Code C20.3), is currently not defined as an eligible activity for EU taxonomy, and hence no technical screening criteria have been developed to measure alignment to the environmental objectives. As a consequence, eligible activities were limited in 2023 and mainly related to supporting CapEx on sustainable solutions for production sites, consisting of investments in renewable electricity solutions, on-site waste water treatment systems and remediation of contaminated sites\n\nand areas. For the determination of eligible CapEx and OpEx, we've performed the following activities:\n\n- \u00b7 Reviewed AkzoNobel's activities and pre-identified potential eligible activities\n- \u00b7 Provided trainings to personnel involved in datagathering, explaining key characteristics of the EU taxonomy guidelines and potential eligible activities\n- \u00b7 Performed a detailed analysis of the individual taxonomy-eligible economic activities in cooperation with key Finance and Sustainability personnel\n- \u00b7 Set up a multi-disciplinary team in charge of supporting and answering questions from personnel involved in data-gathering, as well as reviewing the reported data at a central level\n- \u00b7 Consulted with external experts and peers to ensure a correct and consistent interpretation of the legal requirements\n\nThe outcomes of the EU taxonomy assessment for 2023 in relation to eligibility to the environmental objectives resulted in no eligible turnover and an insignificant amount for CapEx (and related OpEx) related to investments in waste water treatment systems, solar panels and remediation of contaminated sites and areas. The reported amount for CapEx related to investments in waste water treatment systems and solar panels is eligible in relation to the climate change mitigation objective. The reported amount for OpEx related to remediation of contaminated sites and areas is eligible in relation to the pollution prevention and control objective.\n\nAs the \"does not significantly harm\" and minimum safeguard requirements are not met for the eligible CapEx and OpEx - no aligned CapEx or Opex is reported. The template disclosure tables as per Annex II of the Environmental Delegated Act are included in the Appendix of this Report 2023. The non-eligibility of our activities is determined by the limited scope of the EU taxonomy for 2023. Despite this inherent non-eligibility, we continue to focus our efforts towards sustainable solutions and we've made progress towards our ambition of 50% carbon emission reduction by 2030.",

Our assessment showed two material topics: Working time and Health and safety. Both topics have been identified as material for our full value chain, including our own workforce.\n\nWe also provide additional disclosures on topics which are required by applicable laws or regulations, or whenever the disclosures serve the information requirement needs of our stakeholders. These topics are: gender equality and equal pay; discrimination and harassment (including violence); diversity; freedom of association and collective bargaining.\n\nFor 2023, no material people-related impacts from climate change transition plans have been identified.\n\nThe characteristics of our workforce can be found in the Summary table at the end of the Sustainability statements. For the headcount per country with more than 10% of our workforce, refer to the regional statistics in the Financial statements. 1\n\n## Policies related to own workforce\n\nFor topical disclosures, a summary of the relevant policy is included in the dedicated sections.\n\n## Human rights\n\nAs part of our core values of safety, integrity and sustainability, we're committed to respecting internationally recognized human rights in all our operations. This\n\n## Processes for engaging with own workers and workers' representatives about impacts and raising concerns\n\nOur approach to materiality, including the engagement on impacts, risks and opportunities, is described in Impact, risk and opportunity management.\n\nAs described in the Integrity and compliance management chapter, our SpeakUp! grievance mechanism offers employees a means to raise allegations regarding compliance with our Code of Conduct and violations of applicable laws and regulations. A dedicated investigation team follows an investigation protocol which adheres to strict principles of confidentiality, respect for anonymity, non-retaliation, objectivity and the right to be heard.\n\nFor other concerns that might fall outside the scope of our Code of Conduct, employees can use other formal and informal channels to raise their concerns. Examples of formal channels are the option to raise a formal complaint to works councils, trade unions, occupational health services or committees, trusted persons and harassment committees. The availability of these aforementioned channels can differ, depending on the region or country the employee works in. Examples of informal channels include raising concerns to the relevant line manager, HR or site manager, suggestion boxes at locations, or during town halls held at locations.\n\n## Diversity, equity and inclusion\n\nDuring 2023, we launched our new Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DE&I) strategy. It sets out our vision, principles and objectives for creating a respectful work environment where everyone can unleash their full potential.\n\ncommitment is in line with the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGPs) and the International Labor Organization (ILO) Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work. Further support is provided by our human rights framework, which includes policies, a governance structure, a focus on salient issues, due diligence processes to identify and mitigate risks, a grievance mechanism and reporting on risks and actions. Read more in our Human rights position paper.\n\n## Working time\n\nAs laid down in our Code of Conduct, our working hours and remuneration comply with laws and are fair and just. We introduced our own Global Working Hours standard in Europe, Middle East and Africa, Latin America and North Asia, and are continuing to roll them out in the remaining regions. By doing so, we can monitor that we're working a safe number of hours everywhere in the world, even if local laws allow people to work longer. We've conducted an impact analysis in all of our regions and started making region-specific implementation plans to make sure we don't unintentionally cause difficulties for our people and their livelihoods.\n\n## Discrimination and harassment\n\nAs laid down in our Code of Conduct, we treat people with dignity and respect, and we support diversity and inclusion. We don't harass or discriminate, whether through culture, nationality, race, religion, gender, disability, association, sexual orientation or age.",

Every member of our team should feel a strong sense of belonging and a genuine desire to be their true selves\n\nThe full DE&I position paper can be found on our website. We've set targets related to female executives and employee engagement, both are explained below.\n\n## Female executives\n\nOur target is to achieve at least 30% female representation at the executive level 2 by 2025. We're currently at 25%. We consider the promotion and mobilization of internal talent to be fundamental, which is why we've thoroughly assessed the pipeline leading to the executive level. Our next step is to provide growth opportunities to identified talents, alongside setting targets for the two levels below the executive level, for each of the business units and functions. Gender representation remains at the core of our diversity efforts and we're rigorously working towards increasing our representation through offering interesting and challenging prospects to our talent. During the year, 30% of newly hired executives were women and 27% of internal promotions to the executive level were women.\n\nWe also track female representation in our Supervisory Board, Board of Management and Executive Committee. Our plans for reaching our DE&I ambitions are further described in both the DE&I position paper and the DE&I Policy for the executive level, Board of Management and Supervisory Board, which are available on our website.\n\nFurther information on the targets applicable to the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board can be found in the Corporate governance statement.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPercentage of women at executive level.

Out of the 14 graduates from the first training program, 12 are now employed as professional painters.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## DE&I networks\n\nDuring 2023, we also continued to roll out our DE&I workshops, delivered by our growing pool of DE&I Agents, of which we currently have 77 (64 new agents since December 2022). Close to 500 employees participated in our DE&I workshop focused on LGBTI+ inclusion.\n\nOur DE&I networks organized internal events to cover relevant topics and increase awareness, such as events to address menopause, coming out as LGBTI+, disabilities in the workplace and intersectionality. Focus groups, coffee chats and networking sessions were also organized and successfully deployed.\n\n## Diversity and inclusion employee networks\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Building an inclusive workplace\n\nWe upgraded our Talent Acquisition guidelines, requiring among other things, a diverse interview panel to address and help mitigate unconscious bias.\n\nWe continue to focus on our manufacturing and supply chain sites to ensure that our production population experiences a healthy and inclusive environment. For example, during 2023, we invested in improving facilities, such as women's bathrooms, showers and changing rooms. Funds have also been allocated to improving or creating facilities for women during 2024.",

The turnover rate is declining, which is a general picture in the industry. Our overall voluntary turnover rate shows the same number as before the pandemic (below 8%).\n\n## Employee engagement\n\nIn 2023, we adopted a new employee engagement platform, called Voices, which allows us to listen more effectively to our employees, after the previous platform was phased out. The first new employee engagement survey was launched in October 2023 and was rolled out globally.\n\nVoices allows people managers to see their team's feedback in real time, easily share specific data with team members and discuss and identify follow-up actions together, to help them create a better work environment. It means people managers can focus on those areas that matter most to their team, helping to create a shift in our employee engagement.\n\nThe engagement tool empowers employees to speak their mind, not only by answering the questions, but also by leaving comments at any stage.\n\nThe new insights will influence our HR strategies, showing us where we have gaps and where we need to focus first. It requires good analysis and further exploration to identify relevant and appropriate follow-up actions.\n\nThe target for the first Voices survey was a 75% participation rate - recommended as a solid initial launch rate. The fact that we reached a participation rate of 89% was exceptional.\n\nWe also measured the overall engagement index (4.0 out of 5) and eNPS (employee net promoter score), a global standard for organizations to measure employee satisfaction. For eNPS, 0-20 is regarded as good, 20-50 very good, while higher than 50 is excellent. The eNPS benchmark for manufacturing companies is -2. Our results\n\nare shown in the graph below. The results for DE&I engagement specifically show a 4.1 out of 5, among the highest scores company-wide.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Training and skills development indicators\n\nTraining and skills development was not determined to be a material topic, following our double materiality assessment. However, as we consider it good practice to provide this information, we include this topic.\n\n## Talent development\n\nIn 2023, we launched our new talent management framework. We believe in an experience-based talent management approach. This means that employees' careers are shaped around accumulated experiences, and they're motivated by staying future fit. We believe in a culture that stimulates and facilitates talent sharing, where internal opportunities are offered to our employees. This year, the framework was rolled out across all senior managers. For 2024, the framework will be extended to all manager roles in the organization. More insights on our new talent development approach will be shared in our Report 2024.\n\n## Training hours\n\nWe designed our learning and development framework according to our learning formula of 70:20:10. The most effective way to learn and develop a new skill or behavior is to apply and practice on the job and in real life situations. When applying the formula, 70% relates to experience and on-the-job learning - such as job shadowing and stretch projects - 20% relates to exposure (e.g. through mentoring and masterclasses) and 10% to formal education. Our total training hours provided relate to the 10% formal education. This only includes training hours for registered learning efforts and excludes compliance-based mandatory trainings. In 2023, we provided a total of 98,603 training hours to employees, equipping them with the skills and knowledge necessary to excel in their roles and contribute to the success of our organization. We believe that investing in our employees is crucial to our continued growth and success, and we're proud to offer comprehensive training and development opportunities to our teams. The average number of training hours was 2.5 (for women it was four, and for men two).\n\n## Performance reviews\n\nThe overall percentage of employees who participated in our regular performance review was 95% (women: 97%; men: 94%).",

However, from a stakeholder information requirement perspective, we include this topic.\n\nIn 2022, we commissioned an external party specialized in data-driven analyses to explore the gender pay gap within AkzoNobel and evaluate our baseline on gender pay equality. The research found a 0.9% gap in favor of men, after correcting for background variables. For benchmark purposes, the gender pay gap in the EU shows an average pay difference in favor of men of 12.7% for 2021.\n\nDuring 2023, we worked on the findings to prevent the gap from growing by, for example, enabling channels for employees to address salary discrepancies and increasing pay transparency, including reporting to external institutions such as local governments. Another, more indepth, gender pay gap analysis by an external party will take place in the coming years to drive more insights. For further compensation indicators, such as pay ratios, please refer to the Remuneration report.\n\n## Incidents, complaints and severe human rights impacts\n\nDuring 2023, no severe human rights impacts and incidents were reported in our own operations. For an overview of cases registered through our SpeakUp! mechanism, please see the Integrity and compliance management chapter.\n\n## Health and safety\n\nSafety, as one of our core values, is embedded into everything we do. We care about the safety of our colleagues and everyone we work with.\n\n## Health and safety policy\n\nThrough our Health, Safety, Environment and Security (HSE&S) Policy, we acknowledge our responsibility for protecting the health and safety of our employees, contractors, customers and neighbors, while maintaining the security of our people and assets and protecting the environment. It's our vision to achieve zero injuries, waste and harm through operational excellence. The environmental aspects are covered in the Environmental section, while the health and safety elements are covered in this section.\n\nManagement programs in the areas of people safety and health, process safety and security help us live up to the highest standards in our activities and at our sites. Our commitment to running our operations safely is underpinned by our Life-Saving Rules and Golden Principle to stop work if conditions or behavior are unsafe.\n\n## Processes for engaging with workers\n\nOur workforce at all locations help to establish and implement annual HSE&S plans through workers' representative groups, such as works councils and labor organizations. This ensures that we conform to regulatory\n\nrequirements and/or the requirements from our ISO certified HSE&S management systems.\n\n## Targets related to health and safety\n\n- \u00b7 Fatalities (employees, temporary workers, independent contractors): Zero\n- \u00b7 Life-changing injuries: Zero\n- \u00b7 Regulatory actions level 4 (fines above \u20ac100,000): Zero\n\nFor benchmarking purposes, we continue to monitor the following KPI:\n\n- \u00b7 Total reportable injury rate for employees/temporary workers/contractors\n\n## Learning from high potential events\n\nIn addition to learning from actual injuries and incidents, we put special emphasis and processes in place to learn from high potential events (HPEs). A high potential event is an incident with a potential high impact, or a near miss (not causing loss or damage) that might have, under different circumstances, resulted in high, major or catastrophic impact.\n\n## People safety and health\n\nIn 2023, we continued our life-critical procedures and HSE&S roadmap program. We identified areas that need improvement in our own operations and put them on a roadmap with targeted plans and governance. We also continued to invest in functional excellence and the renewal of our HSE&S capability framework.\n\nIn 2023, we continued the implementation of our lift truck/ pedestrian segregation program and continued with Behaviour Based Safety (BBS), focusing on increased quality through more coached observations and strengthening the capability in this area.\n\nWe launched company-wide monthly Safety Moments for safety awareness, which are used by people managers in their team meetings to keep colleagues in all functions and",

To meet EU compliance requirements, we launched Diisocyanate training in all applicable European languages.\n\nDuring 2023, we included the Grupo Orbis acquisition in Latin America in our statistics, adding eight manufacturing locations and 7% to the hours worked. The total reportable rate (TRR) for employees and temporary workers increased to 0.31 (2022: 0.24). Although this is still at industry-leading levels, the main contributors of the increase were the Grupo Orbis sites, responsible for 19% of our reportable incidents. We're continuing to integrate these sites to AkzoNobel standards.\n\nIn total, 63% of our manufacturing sites have been reportable injury-free for over a year (2022: 66%).\n\nThe lost time injury rate (LTIR) for employees and temporary workers remained stable at 0.14 (2022: 0.13). The severity of injuries remained low. The most common causes of injuries were manual handling/lifting, slip/trip/falls and cuts. The most frequent injuries were cuts/lacerations, fractures and sprain/strains.\n\n- u Total reportable injury rate employees including temporary workers (per 200,000 hours)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe total reportable injury rate (TRR) is the number of injuries resulting in a medical treatment case, restricted work case and lost time case or fatality, per 200,000 hours worked.

For TRR contractors, please see our Summary table.\n\n- u Lost time injury rate employees including temporary workers (per 200,000 hours)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe lost time injury rate (LTlR) is the number of injuries resulting in a lost time injury per 200,000 hours worked. Temporary workers are reported together with employees, since day-to-day management is carried out by AkzoNobel. For lost time injury rate contractors, please see our Summary table.\n\nOne life-changing injury occurred in Jakarta, Indonesia - a partial finger amputation caused by the internals of a block valve. There were no further life-changing injuries or fatalities in 2023.\n\nDuring 2023, the number of contractor recordable injuries was 14 (2022: 10).\n\n## Safety Day 2023\n\nOur annual Safety Day is the moment for us to celebrate safety and reflect on how we're doing. This year's theme was 'Make safety a habit today'. The theme encouraged colleagues to reflect on their own behavior and become safety leaders by embedding good safety habits into their daily routines - both at work and during private time. This theme further built on our 'Be human, Be safe' program, which took a human performance principles approach.\n\n## Regulatory compliance\n\nDuring 2023, we received two fines in the category Regulatory Actions level 4 - fines above \u20ac100,000 (2022: one).\n\n- \u00b7 In January, we received a \u00a3650,000 fine related to the Newton Ferrers (UK) environmental incident in 2015\n- \u00b7 In April, our Birmingham site in the UK received a \u00a3600,000 fine as result of a forklift truck incident which occurred in 2018\n- \u00b7 As mentioned in Basis for preparation, a notification of a fine imposed by the UK authorities in December 2022, in response to a process safety incident in 2020 at our Felling site, came in too late to include in the annual report for 2022. As a result, the RA4 number for 2022 has been adjusted from 0 to 1\n\n## Process safety\n\nWe systematically assess, manage and communicate the operational risks of injuries or harm that may result from the work we do.\n\nIn 2023, we continued our dedicated Process Safety Management (PSM) improvement project, designed to strengthen our processes and achieve leading standards in process safety.\n\nTo ensure our people, sites and environments stay as safe as possible, we continued the deployment of our Process Safety Fundamentals for front-line workers, establishing operational practices that help prevent incidents.",

The standards define company expectations for these higher risk activities. Various engineering standards have been adopted: for grounding and bonding; flexible hose management; and maintenance of solvent storage tanks. Our locations continue to implement equipment modifications via a riskbased approach.\n\nIn 2023, we included the Grupo Orbis acquisition in Latin America in our statistics. In total, we recorded 87 losses of primary containment (LoPCs) in 2023 (2022: 53), of which 19 were contributed by the Grupo Orbis sites, which continue on an integration path to AkzoNobel standards.\n\nThe main causes identified were operational discipline (60%) and asset integrity (32%). In total, 70% of our manufacturing locations had zero LoPCs at the end of 2023, demonstrating our vision of zero spills is achievable. However, 11% of our locations caused 66% of the spills in 2023. We continue to focus on these locations, ensuring improvement plans to act on the underlying root causes.\n\n## Process safety events\n\n|                                        |   2022 |   2023 |\n|----------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| LoPC level 1 and 2                     |     53 |     87 |\n| LoPC level 1 and 2 (excl.

They're divided into categories, dependent on severity, from small, on-site spills up to level 1.\n\n## Security\n\nOur security program protects people, information, assets and critical business processes, both on and off-site. During 2023, one level 3 (most severe events) incident occurred (2022: zero), related to theft of raw materials. A deep-dive analysis was carried out to identify root causes and the corresponding action plans were put in place. Theft and vandalism at our stores continued to represent the highest incident sub-type, which is similar to wider society.\n\n## HSE&S management foundation\n\nOur company-wide HSE&S management system is globally certified against ISO 14001 and ISO 45001 standards. The management system consists of policies, procedures, templates and best practices to promote learning across the organization and covers the activities of all employees and temporary workers.\n\nHSE&S audits are performed in three-year (for high hazard sites) to five-year (other sites) cycles. During 2023, we conducted 33 audits in total. Compliance assurance is a key HSE&S priority because it ensures our license to operate and our business continuity in a fast-changing regulatory environment.\n\nOur company-wide HSE&S compliance assurance process is proactive and digitally supported by tools from a leading third-party supplier.\n\nOur annual Safety Day was celebrated in style by colleagues at the Songjiang Decorative Paints site in China. Various activities were held based on the theme of 'Make safety a habit today', including a town hall meeting, firefighting practice competition and safe driving contest. Employees from six departments also shared their safety habits.\n\n<!-- image -->",

For workers in our value chain, our assessment showed two material topics: Working time and Health and safety. We also provide additional disclosures on modern slavery, which serves an information requirement of our stakeholders. For 2023, downstream workers are not yet covered in our disclosures.\n\n## Policies related to value chain workers\n\n## Human rights\n\nAs part of our core values, we're committed to respecting internationally recognized human rights in all our operations and throughout our value chain. This commitment is in line with the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGPs) and the International Labor Organization (ILO) Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work. Read more in our Human rights position statement.\n\n## Business Partner CoC\n\nOur business partners are expected to follow our company's core values of safety, integrity and sustainability. These are set out in our Business Partner Code of Conduct (BP CoC). This code sets out the ethical behavior we expect from anyone we do business with, including our suppliers, distributors and agents. All new business partners are expected to apply the principles laid down in the BP CoC, or apply equivalent principles. These principles include, among other things, respect for human rights, people, process and product safety, fair and just working hours and remuneration, and grievance mechanisms for their employees and other interested\n\nparties. Non-compliance with the BP CoC may lead to measures being taken, including termination of the business relationship.\n\n## Modern slavery statement\n\nWe're aware that multiple risks come with a complex and long supply chain, including the risk that modern slavery may exist in these supply chains. Our Modern slavery statement sets out our commitment to do our utmost to prevent modern slavery in our business and supply chain.\n\n## Conflict minerals and mica minerals\n\nWe have separate position statements on conflict and mica minerals. In these statements, we describe our commitment to responsible sourcing, as an important part of AkzoNobel's supplier sustainability strategy. We do our best to ensure our suppliers' products and components do not contribute to adverse impacts on human rights. We do that by conducting due diligence together with our suppliers into the conflict minerals and mica minerals supply chains, and take appropriate action when necessary.\n\n## Processes for engaging with value chain workers about impacts\n\n## General\n\nWe perform third party, on-site sustainability audits on selected direct raw material suppliers in high-risk areas. We do this through our membership of Together for Sustainability (TfS). A full description of how we manage supplier relationships is included in Supplier management in the Governance section of these Sustainability statements. The Labor and human rights section of these audits include questions on child labor, forced and compulsory labor, working hours, minimum wages, freedom of association, discrimination and harassment, special work contracts and facilities and dormitories. The third-party auditors (approved by TfS) are requested to verify document reviews and conduct individual and group interviews. Candidates for these interviews are randomly\n\nselected by the auditor, without interference from management. In 2023, we identified two improvement opportunities on child or forced labor governance at suppliers in China that we're working on to address. The first requires the supplier to develop a child labor remediation plan in case of any sign of child labor. The second improvement opportunity is focused on ensuring that the supplier obtains timely signatures on labor contracts.\n\nFor suppliers who deliver raw materials that contain products as described in Taking action on material impacts, risks and opportunities - and who fall under our human rights due diligence program for materials which have high risks of negative impacts on human rights occurring in their supply chain - we provided a webinar for our suppliers to explain AkzoNobel's efforts in this area and what we expect from our suppliers. More than 100 individuals attended one of the two webinar sessions across the globe.\n\n## Mica minerals\n\nWe're a founding member of the Responsible Mica Initiative (RMI), whose mission it is to establish a fair, responsible and sustainable mica supply chain in India, that's free of child labor by 2030. Via this initiative, much engagement takes place with workers in the supply chain, for example through the Supply Chain Mapping and Workplace Standards program and the Community Empowerment program.\n\n## Processes to remediate negative impacts and channels for value chain workers to raise concerns\n\nAs described in the Integrity and compliance management chapter, our SpeakUp! grievance mechanism offers employees and third parties a means to raise allegations relating to compliance with our BP CoC and violations of applicable laws and regulations.

Our partners should provide their employees and other interested parties with a mechanism to raise concerns about violation or potential violation of laws and the values provided in this Code of Conduct. These concerns must be addressed in a fair and transparent way. Our business partners protect confidentiality and prohibit retaliation against those raising the concern.\n\nIn addition to the above, and as mentioned in Supplier management, we perform EcoVadis assessments as part of our TfS membership on high-risk and high-spend direct suppliers. In this assessment, we also ask whether these suppliers have implemented a formal grievance mechanism which encourages employees and external stakeholders to report potential violations of the partner's external stakeholder human rights policies.\n\nIn the Responsible Mica Initiative (as previously mentioned), a grievance mechanism was also launched this year with the aim of a fair, timely and objective resolution of grievances relating to the implementation of its mission and operations. The form to file a complaint is available in English, French, Hindi and Malagasy.\n\n## Taking action on material impacts, risks and opportunities\n\nWith regard to addressing potential modern slavery in our supply chain, we're focusing on both our direct and indirect suppliers. For our direct suppliers, we identify our high-risk suppliers in our Sustainability Supplier Framework and assess and audit them. More details about this program and our membership of TfS can be found in our Governance chapter. For our indirect suppliers - where we have to look further in the supply chain due to certain risks - we've conducted in-depth research into our raw materials portfolio and prioritized high-risk supply chains, based on publicly available information by NGOs and\n\ngovernment agencies. This resulted in a focus on our barytes, calcium carbonate, cobalt, copper, fluorspar, mica minerals, talcum and tin supply chains. In 2023, based on further investigations, we concluded that we couldn't indicate any modern slavery risks in our barytes supply chain and have therefore removed it from our highrisk supply chains list. Read more about the results of this due diligence in the last paragraph of this chapter.\n\nWe participated in the TfS program 'Jointly addressing child labor, forced labor and human trafficking' by requesting suppliers with room for improvement in that area (as per their EcoVadis scorecard) to utilize the human rights training courses on the TfS academy.\n\nIn addition, through our RMI membership, we delivered positive impact for workers in the mica value chain in India. The Community Empowerment program is transforming communities in the mica region with initiatives that provide long-term and self-sustainable remedies to the underlying causes of child labor and poor working conditions. Launched in 2018, more than 180 villages and 16,000 households are now benefiting from programs, including better schools and healthcare delivery, access to more diverse sources of livelihood and receipt of government services.\n\n## Targets related to managing material negative impacts, advancing positive impacts, and managing material risks and opportunities\n\n## EcoVadis assessments\n\nAs mentioned in Supplier management, we perform EcoVadis assessments as part of our TfS membership on high-risk and high-spend direct suppliers. In addition to the total assessment score, we also expect a minimum score of 50 in the labor and human rights section of these assessments. Through our Sustainability Supplier Program, we track how many suppliers meet this\n\nrequirement. For 2023, 63% of our suppliers met this requirement (2022: 52%).\n\nWhile we saw continuous improvement on this KPI versus 2022, we realize small and medium suppliers in risk regions have more difficulties reaching these minimum requirements. All suppliers have access to the TfS and EcoVadis academy with dedicated courses in multiple languages. For 2024, we plan to measure the number of suppliers who completed trainings in these two academies.\n\n## Together for Sustainability (TfS) audits\n\nFor TfS on-site audits, we measured completion of corrective actions on major and critical findings and achieved an improvement rate of 86%.\n\n## Human rights due diligence\n\nAs part of our due diligence program regarding materials with potential human rights impacts, we measure the percentage of responses received to our surveys. For tin and cobalt, we also measure the percentage of smelters that are either listed as active or conformant smelters in the Responsible Minerals Assurance Process.\n\nIn 2023, we sent out 356 surveys on the minerals mentioned in Taking action on material impacts, risks and opportunities, to which 80% responded (2022: 85%). The reason for the slightly lower response rate, compared with 2022, is that we increased new suppliers in the surveys by about 20%.\n\nOf the 115 suppliers who confirmed using tin and/or cobalt necessary for the functionality of the product, 79% disclosed their smelters. In total, 86% of these smelters were either listed as active or conformant smelters in the Responsible Minerals Assurance Process.\n\nFor mica, there are currently no conformant mica processors listed on the Responsible Mineral Initiative platform. However, through our RMI membership, we together with many stakeholders and peer companies commit to:",

We'll take action on these in 2024, such as asking our suppliers about the controls they have in place. If no controls exist, we'll request that these controls be put in place (e.g. by means of social audits or visits).\n\n## AFFECTED COMMUNITIES\n\n## Materiality\n\nOur approach to determining our material impacts, risks and opportunities is described in General disclosures. We did not identify any material impacts for affected communities. We did identify the social programs under the AkzoNobel Cares umbrella as an opportunity, which is included in this section. In addition, we detail the processes we have in place to remediate potential negative impacts and channels available to raise concerns.\n\n## Policies related to affected communities\n\nAs set out in our Code of Conduct, we fully understand our role and responsibilities when it comes to society and contributing to the communities we operate in. Whenever\n\npossible, we make a positive difference to the world around us, engaging with people and organizations to help bring the AkzoNobel brand to life, while supporting deserving and sustainable projects and causes, using our products when appropriate. We encourage all employees to get involved in community activities, as long as it doesn't lead to a conflict of interest.\n\nIn our Business Partner Code of Conduct, we state that our suppliers should care about the communities they operate in, and listen to their concerns.\n\n## Processes for engaging with affected communities about impacts\n\nAs part of our HSE&S processes (for more information, see the chapter on our Own workforce) we require every location to have a procedure in place that covers processes for stakeholder outreach and external complaints. Communities are included as important stakeholders of our locations - the aim is to engage, listen to any concerns and actively support community projects.\n\n## Processes to remediate negative impacts and channels for affected communities to raise concerns\n\nAs described in the Integrity and compliance management chapter, our SpeakUp! grievance mechanism offers third parties, including members of an affected community, a means to raise allegations regarding compliance with our Code of Conduct and violations of applicable laws and regulations. A dedicated investigation team follows an investigation protocol which adheres to strict principles of confidentiality, respect for anonymity, non-retaliation, objectivity and the right to be heard.\n\nMembers of an affected community can also file a complaint directly to the site manager of the relevant location.\n\n## Pursuing material opportunities related to affected communities\n\n## AkzoNobel Cares\n\nFor many years, our various social programs have been demonstrating to the world that AkzoNobel cares. People and communities all around the globe benefit from the initiatives and programs under our AkzoNobel Cares umbrella, including 'Let's Colour', the Pintuco Foundation, SOS Children's Villages and the Education Fund. Local volunteers from AkzoNobel work closely with partners to transform communities and make a positive impact. As part of our key sustainability ambitions, the aim is to empower more than 100,000 community members with new skills between 2020 and 2030, through more than 2,000 projects.\n\nOur main social programs focus on inspiring, uplifting and renovating communities through our global 'Let's Colour' initiative. We also educate, mentor and train future generations, unlocking possibilities for people who need them most. In 2023, we staged 311 projects and trained around 32,000 people in painting, entrepreneurship, professional skills and soft skills.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Our global 'Let's Colour' initiative is all about adding color to people's lives. With our passion for paint, we aim to provide opportunities for people who want to learn, grow and flourish. During 2023, we donated more than 212,000 liters of paint to renovate community living spaces in 37 countries, with 1,892 employees volunteering their time. A great example was the vibrant makeover of Suryatmajan in Yogyakarta, Indonesia. The village became a visual spectacle and gained recognition as a tourist destination (see image and caption on the right).\n\nOur Nordsj\u00f6 brand has been working with ARTSCAPE in Sweden since 2014. This year, nine walls were transformed as part of the 2023 Street Art Festival in V\u00e4nersborg, including this mural created by street artist Charlie Granberg.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## SOS Children's Villages\n\nIn 2023, we continued to be a strategic partner of SOS Children's Villages. As a member of the Global YouthCan! platform, we work together to support young people at risk on their journey to self-reliance. Through our painter academies and by offering soft skills training, entrepreneurship programs, mentoring and traineeships, we empowered 2,948 young people with new skills in 2023. We also used our paint to refresh living spaces for children growing up in family-like care. During 2023, Colombia joined the partnership, bringing the total to 25 countries involved so far.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Education Fund\n\nThrough our joint Education Fund, established in 1994, we continued to support Plan International. In 2022, Plan International started the Saksham Plus project in collaboration with the AkzoNobel Paint Academy in Delhi, India. This economic empowerment initiative targets marginalized young people, particularly women, addressing the gap between high market demand for skilled employees and the insufficient number of qualified individuals. So far, the project has equipped 29 vulnerable young people with market-driven skills, fostering sustained employment in the painting sector.\n\n## Local AkzoNobel Cares programs\n\nOur societal initiatives in India benefited more than 50,000 people in 2023. Parivartan, our flagship education project, helped more than 7,000 children gain better access to education, while vocational skills training empowered 3,500 underprivileged and disadvantaged youth. More than 25,000 teleconsultations were also provided under our community healthcare program in villages across the country. A key highlight was Project Indradhanush, which aims to improve the livelihoods of women in rural India. In\n\nOur Dulux brand turned Suryatmajan Village in Yogyakarta, Indonesia, into a visual spectacle as part of a 'Let's Colour' project. Beyond creating vibrant murals and colorful walls, it also helped to attract tourists to the area, symbolizing both economic growth and community empowerment.\n\n2023, the initiative raised awareness among more than 34,000 women about opportunities in the paint sector, providing paint application training and empowering women with the necessary skills to become independent paint retailers.\n\nThe Pintuco Foundation also contributes to AkzoNobel Cares. The Colombia-based non-profit entity, part of the Grupo Orbis acquisition, is similar to our existing 'Let's Colour' program. It transforms lives with color and offers social sustainability projects that also provide (skills) training opportunities for people in local communities. The social projects are developed through alliances with public and private organizations.",

        "page_content": "|\n\n## GOVERNANCE\n\n## BUSINESS CONDUCT\n\n## Corporate culture and business conduct policies\n\nWe're committed to leading with integrity in our industry. The Integrity and compliance management chapter sets out in more detail how we establish, develop and promote a corporate culture.\n\n## Our Code of Conduct\n\nOur core principles define the culture and behaviors that we're committed to embedding throughout AkzoNobel. We have three core principles - safety, integrity and sustainability. Our Code of Conduct, which is available in 32 languages, defines the way we live our core principles every day. It covers various topics, including anti-bribery and anti-corruption, honest business conduct, conflicts of interest, health and safety and human rights. We carry out Code of Conduct training for all our employees every other year (both online and face-to-face, and tailored to white and blue collar colleagues), as well as specific training on key risks to targeted audiences. Our completion rate for the Code of Conduct training for online employees is more than 90%. The progress on training is reported to our Executive Committee and Audit Committee on a quarterly basis. This is also supported by a communication program, which focuses on having a strong tone at the top, raising greater awareness and driving improvement.\n\n## Culture of integrity\n\nThe regional Integrity and Compliance Managers contribute to further strengthening the culture of integrity. This includes identifying and addressing local risks and cooperating with the business and functional teams to tailor the program to local risks and follow up on internal audit findings and SpeakUp! cases.\n\n## SpeakUp!\n\nOur SpeakUp! grievance mechanism offers employees and third parties a means to raise concerns relating to compliance with our Code of Conduct. Our dedicated investigation team follows an investigation protocol which adheres to strict principles of confidentiality, respect for anonymity, non-retaliation, objectivity and the right to be heard. Anyone who believes they've been retaliated against for making a good faith concern can also report such retaliation, which will be investigated as a potential Code of Conduct violation. As set out in the Integrity and compliance management chapter, our Integrity and Compliance SpeakUp! Committee reviews these investigations and also decides on discipline and control improvement actions, as well as monitoring and responding to any trends identified in investigations. The number of reports and the status are reported quarterly to the Executive Committee and Audit Committee.\n\n## Management of relationships with suppliers\n\nWe work with our suppliers to create value and continuously improve our sustainability and theirs. We have dedicated programs in place to engage with suppliers on the various subjects.\n\nWith regard to social and environmental risks, all direct suppliers with an annual spend of more than \u20ac1,000 are requested to sign our Business Partner Code of Conduct. This is a core part of our commercial agreement with our suppliers and enables us to do business based on our core values of safety, integrity and sustainability. Signatories cover 99% (2022: 99%) of the product related spend and 93% (2022: 93%, excluding logistics) of the non-product related spend, including logistics. In 2023, we implemented an IT solution to automate the collection and filing of the Code of Conduct signatories.\n\nFor direct suppliers with an annual spend of \u20ac250,000, we perform an annual risk analysis, reviewing the country and industry risks our suppliers are exposed to. The threshold has been set to ensure it also covers small and mediumsized companies. Any suppliers that are identified as highrisk through this annual approach are selected for the Together for Sustainability (TfS) Assessment and Audit program. In 2023, the total number of suppliers in scope amounted to 1,347 suppliers, covering 83% of our global spend and 93% of our upstream carbon emissions. TfS (of which we've been a member since 2013), is a procurement-driven initiative that improves the sustainability performance of chemical companies and their suppliers. The program is based on the UN Global Compact and Responsible Care \u00ae principles. The sustainability assessments are performed by EcoVadis, a partner of both TfS and AkzoNobel and covers topics in the areas of environment, labor and human rights, ethics and sustainable procurement, based on international standards.\n\n- u Suppliers in sustainability program bar size indicates total number of suppliers\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMeet expectations\n\nUnder development\n\nNot assessed/Lost validity\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2021\n\n2022\n\n2023",

        "page_content": "|\n\n|\n\nSuppliers in this sustainability program are requested to achieve a total score of 45 and a labor and human rights score of 50 through an annual assessment. Suppliers not yet meeting these thresholds are shown as 'under development' in the graph. Complementary to the assessment, we perform third-party TfS audits on selected supplier sites in risk regions. In 2023, a total of 22 TfS site audits were performed on our suppliers.\n\nThrough the EcoVadis and TfS academy, we provide trainings to our suppliers on sustainability topics. In addition, we perform annual onboarding webinars, which were attended by 95 supplier individuals in 2023.\n\nWe continued to reduce our supply base quite significantly during 2023. This helped us manage our sustainability program through consolidated suppliers with a good sustainability performance. This contributed to a reduced number of suppliers in the sustainability program (85 fewer versus 2022).\n\nLooking at carbon emission mitigation, because 46% of our carbon emissions come from our upstream activities, this is an area where we can make a big impact through collaboration and innovation with our suppliers. More details can be found under Climate change mitigation.\n\nFor indirect suppliers, the TfS program already addresses sustainable procurement activities at our suppliers (our Tier 2 suppliers). In addition, we have a human rights due diligence program to address potential impacts on human rights further up in our value chain. More information can be found in Workers in our value chain.\n\nAs part of our approach to managing our relationship with suppliers, we provide various sustainability trainings to our buyers. These trainings are available via our learning academy 'Success Factors'. We also offer live webinars. For 2023, our buyers' training focused on upcoming legislation requirements, particularly human rights due diligence. A total of 74 buyers attended these webinars. For more information about our approach to human rights in our upstream value chain, see Workers in our value chain.\n\n## Prevention and detection of corruption or bribery\n\nAt AkzoNobel, we're committed to conducting our business fairly, transparently and with integrity, while applying the highest ethical and legal standards. We don't make, offer or authorize bribes or conduct any other form of unethical business practice. We believe in competing on the merits of our products.\n\nOur rules and procedures related to anti-corruption or antibribery can be found on our Policy Portal, which is accessible to our employees. The regional Integrity and Compliance Managers provide support for identifying and addressing local risks, and cooperating with the business and functional teams to tailor the program to local risks and follow up on internal audit findings and SpeakUp! cases.\n\nMandatory training on anti-corruption/anti-bribery is delivered digitally to all new online colleagues. Classroom trainings are also given for specific teams and on specific risks that result from SpeakUp! cases, audit findings or general preventive measures. As covered in the Integrity and compliance management chapter, during 2023, we launched a new online gifts and hospitality training. To help our employees act in line with our anti-bribery and anticorruption rules and procedures, we launched new and improved gift and conflict of interest tools (including a preapproval workflow).\n\nIn 2023, we successfully launched a pilot program for Third-Party Risk Management, targeting sales-side highrisk third parties, screening them on corruption and bribery risks. With regard to our suppliers, our EcoVadis assessments also cover corruption and bribery.\n\nAny alleged violation of our anti-corruption or anti-bribery rules and procedures can be reported through our SpeakUp! process (as previously described) and is then investigated by an independent team.\n\n## Political influence and lobbying activities\n\nAs a leading paints and coatings company, we participate in the public debate about various topics within our industry. Collaborating with stakeholders is fundamental to what we want to achieve. Our lobbying activities, and broader stakeholder engagement, are guided by our company strategy and governance and are based on material impacts, including our approach to sustainability. AkzoNobel representatives engage directly and indirectly via trade and industry associations, as well as dedicated sustainability coalitions - with stakeholders globally.\n\nAkzoNobel has a global policy in place around Donations and Sponsorships Rules and Procedures. It states that we should not promise, offer, give or authorize anything of value, directly or through others, with the intent to improperly influence or reward a business decision. The policy adds that all employees have a responsibility to make decisions in the company's best interest and to ensure that our dealings with (business) partners are objective and not influenced by donations or sponsorships. We do not provide donations and/or",

Consequently, a broad range of processes and procedures has been implemented, designed to provide control by the Board of Management over the company's operations. These include measures regarding the general control environment, such as a Code of Conduct, policies and procedures and authority rules, as well as specific measures, such as a risk management system, a system of controls and a system of letters of financial representation by responsible management at various levels within our company.\n\nAll these processes and procedures are aimed at providing a reasonable level of assurance that we have identified and managed the significant risks of our company, and that we meet our operational and financial\n\nobjectives in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. For a detailed description of the company's internal risk management, please refer to the Risk management chapter.\n\nThe Integrity and Compliance function makes policies, rules and procedures available through the Policy Portal, manages the online and face-to-face compliance training program, provides legal expert support and manages investigations related to our SpeakUp! complaints procedure. For a more detailed description of the integrity and compliance framework, please refer to the Integrity and compliance management chapter.\n\nThe Internal Control function maintains AkzoNobel's Internal Control Framework, monitors the compliance and includes updates regarding the emergence of new risks. They support the annual review of the design and effectiveness of the system of governance, risk management and internal controls of the Board of Management. Internal Audit provides comfort to the Board of Management, as well as the Supervisory Board, that our system of risk management and internal controls - as designed and represented by management - is adequate and effective.\n\nWhile we routinely work towards continuous improvement of our processes and procedures regarding financial reporting, the Board of Management confirms that according to the current state of affairs, to the best of its knowledge:\n\n- \u00b7 The Report 2023 provides sufficient insights into any failings in the effectiveness of the internal risk management and control systems with regard to the risks associated with the strategy and activities of AkzoNobel and the undertakings included in the consolidation, including the strategic, operational, compliance and reporting risks\n- \u00b7 There have been no material failings in the effectiveness of internal risk management and control systems\n- \u00b7 These systems provide reasonable assurance that the financial reporting does not contain material inaccuracies\n- \u00b7 It is justified that the financial reporting is prepared on a going concern basis\n- \u00b7 There are no material risks associated with the strategy and activities of AkzoNobel and the undertakings included in the consolidation, including the strategic, operational, compliance and reporting risks, or uncertainties that could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the continuity of the company's operations for the 12month period after report preparation\n\nWe have discussed the above opinion and conclusions with the Audit Committee, the Supervisory Board and the external auditor.\n\nAmsterdam, February 26, 2024\n\n## The Board of Management\n\nGreg Poux-Guillaume, CEO and Chair of the Board of Management\n\nMaarten de Vries, CFO and member of the Board of Management",

Management deserves credit for acting decisively to implement its four strategic priorities - margin management, cost reduction, working capital normalization and deleveraging - which ensured that the company was able to deliver and make good progress on its strategic ambitions.\n\nAs we move into 2024, it's a question of staying financially disciplined - reducing both debt and leverage - while maintaining our strategic direction and further building on the power of our brands. Unlocking the significant value to be gained by improving operations has been identified as a major priority. As a Supervisory Board, we fully support the decision to implement a long-term industrial excellence plan, which is now underway. It's focused on reducing\n\ncomplexity, improving capacity utilization and investing in the modernization of the company's sites. There's significant value to be gained and the plan will be an important part of our strategy for the next few years.\n\nAlthough it was a relatively quiet year in terms of M&A, we did complete the acquisition of the Huarun business in China. It was a significant transaction, which will further boost our position in decorative paints in the region. It's also been encouraging to see the integration of the Grupo Orbis activities - acquired in 2022 - continue to go smoothly. Both of these investments highlight the company's commitment to strengthening its global activities and will make important contributions to AkzoNobel's long-term growth potential.\n\nThe company is determined to continue moving forward and the Supervisory Board was pleased to see management address several key improvement areas across the organization. The introduction of the new Voices employee engagement platform and survey was particularly notable. The level of engagement exceeded the industry average, which is an admirable achievement. It will be interesting to see the impact the platform has on helping to create a more stimulating and fulfilling work environment.\n\nThe company's Paint the Future collaborative innovation ecosystem also continued to gain momentum during the\n\nyear. The latest 24-hour challenge - staged in November 2023 - was focused on reducing the collective carbon footprint of the vehicle repair industry. Working with several partners, the aim is to develop a shared approach to tackling climate change. It's an excellent example of how the company is looking for meaningful and impactful ways to reduce carbon emissions across its own operations and the entire value chain.\n\nIt's clear from the ongoing implementation of strategic and operational initiatives that management is working hard to address today's challenges, while laying the necessary foundations for the company to thrive tomorrow - which will pave the way for a future to excite all our stakeholders. I'm very much looking forward to contributing to the next phase of AkzoNobel's transformation.\n\nOn behalf of the Supervisory Board, I would like to thank our shareholders and all other stakeholders for their continued trust in the company, as well as my Supervisory Board colleagues, the Board of Management and Executive Committee for all their efforts during 2023. I'd also like to express deep appreciation for the continued hard work and commitment of AkzoNobel's employees around the world, who helped to deliver a solid performance in a far from perfect business climate.\n\nAmsterdam, February 26, 2024\n\n## Ben Noteboom\n\nChair of the Supervisory Board",

This included taking the time to discuss its own composition and succession plans in order to ensure continued effectiveness.\n\nWith Nils Smedegaard Andersen stepping down after the 2023 AGM, the Supervisory Board nominated Ben Noteboom for appointment to the Supervisory Board. The Supervisory Board further nominated Jolanda Poots-Bijl and Dick Sluimers for reappointment to the Supervisory Board. Dick Sluimers was initially appointed to the Supervisory Board in 2015, and reappointed for a second four-year term in 2019. He has been Chair of the Remuneration Committee since June 2017 and member of the Nomination Committee since February 2020. Prior to this, he was an Audit Committee member. Given his extensive experience with AkzoNobel - and to ensure the\n\ncontinuity and effectiveness of the Supervisory Board and the Remuneration Committee while allowing for appropriate succession planning - the Supervisory Board nominated Dick Sluimers to be reappointed to the Supervisory Board for a third term of two years. Jolanda Poots-Bijl and Dick Sluimers did not take part in the deliberations and voting regarding their own reappointments. The appointment and reappointments were approved at the AGM held on April 21, 2023. Ben Noteboom was elected as Chair of the Supervisory Board. The Supervisory Board also discussed the succession of Jolanda Poots-Bijl, who stepped down as member of the Supervisory Board as of January 31, 2024.\n\nThe requirements of the Corporate Governance Code, the Supervisory Board's profile, skills matrix and its policy on diversity and inclusion were considered throughout these processes. Further information can be found in the report of the Nomination Committee.\n\nThe Supervisory Board further discussed and supported changes to the composition of the Executive Committee.

With Jo\u00eblle Boxus stepping down as Chief Human Resources Officer per March 31, 2023, her responsibilities were taken over on an ad-interim basis until the appointment of Armand Sohet as new Chief Human Resources Officer per July 1, 2023. Dr. Hilka Schneider stepped down as General Counsel as of October 15, 2023, with her responsibilities being taken over on an adinterim basis until the appointment of Charlotte van Meer as new General Counsel per January 1, 2024.\n\n## Independence of the Supervisory Board\n\nSupervisory Board members are required to act critically and independently of one another, the Board of Management, the Executive Committee and the company's stakeholders. Each Supervisory Board member meets the independence requirements of the Corporate Governance Code and completed the annual independence questionnaire addressing the relevant requirements for independence.\n\n## Supervisory Board evaluation\n\nTo assess its effectiveness, the Supervisory Board carried out an internal performance evaluation of itself, its individual members, its Audit, Remuneration and Nomination Committees, the Chair, as well as the relationship with the Board of Management and the Executive Committee. The process consisted of the Supervisory Board members completing a confidential questionnaire.\n\nIn a separate meeting without the Board of Management, the Supervisory Board discussed the results of the evaluation questionnaires and reflected on the improvement areas agreed during last year's evaluation. The Supervisory Board also discussed the functioning of the Board of Management and the performance of its individual members. Feedback was provided to, and\n\ndiscussed with, the members of the Board of Management.\n\nThe evaluation concluded that the Supervisory Board and its committees continue to operate proficiently. The Supervisory Board composition, and that of its committees, has the right blend of experience, knowledge, skills and diversity and there's a dynamic and open atmosphere between the Supervisory Board and the Board of Management, as well as the other members of the Executive Committee. Focus items going forward include continued attention for executive succession planning and talent management. Additional time will be spent on contributing to the development of the group strategy.\n\n## Financial statements and profit allocation\n\nThe Board of Management submitted the report and financial statements, including the report of the Board of Management, to the Supervisory Board for review and approval. The financial statements of Akzo Nobel N.V. for the financial year 2023 were audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers Accountants N.V. (PwC).\n\nThe financial statements and the report were extensively discussed by the Audit Committee with the external auditors, in the presence of the CFO, and by the full Supervisory Board with the Board of Management and the Executive Committee. Based on these discussions, the Supervisory Board is of the opinion that the 2023 financial statements of Akzo Nobel N.\\/. form an adequate basis to account for the supervision provided (see the Financial information). The Audit Committee monitors the follow-up by management on the recommendations made by the external auditors.\n\nThe Supervisory Board recommends that the AGM adopts the financial statements as presented in this Report 2023 and, as proposed by the Board of Management, the proposed total dividend for 2023 of \u20ac1.98 (2022: \u20ac1.98), including a final dividend of \u20ac1.54 per share. An interim dividend of \u20ac0.44 (2022: \u20ac0.44) per share was paid in November 2023. This reflects the continued commitment to providing a stable to rising dividend. The dividend will be paid in cash.\n\nIn addition, it is requested that the AGM discharges the Board of Management members from their responsibility for the conduct of business in 2023, and the Supervisory Board members for their supervision in 2023.\n\n## Committees of the Supervisory Board\n\n| Nils Smedegaard  Andersen (Chair 1 )   | Audit  Committee   | Remuneration  Committee Member 1   | Nomination  Committee Chair 1   |\n|----------------------------------------|--------------------|------------------------------------|---------------------------------|\n| Ben Noteboom  (Chair 2 )               |                    | Member 3                           | Chair 4                         |\n| (Deputy Chair) Ester Baiget            | Member             |                                    |                                 |\n| Jolanda Poots- Bijl 5                  |                    |                                    |                                 |\n| Hans Van Bylen                         | Member             | Member                             | Member                          |\n| Pamela Kirby                           |                    | Member                             | Member                          |\n| Dick Sluimers                          |                    | Chair                              | Member                          |\n| Patrick Thomas                         | Member             |                                    |                                 |\n\n4 Per May 19, 2023\n\n5 Until January 31, 2024\n\n## Audit Committee\n\nAll Audit Committee members have extensive accounting and financial management expertise.

The Audit Committee held independent meetings with the external auditor and critically reviewed and constructively challenged their audit approach, fees, risk assessment and audit plan. The Audit Committee performed an annual review of the services of the external auditor, and at each meeting considered and assessed the status of the auditor's independence.\n\nIn line with applicable regulations, the PwC lead partner in charge of the AkzoNobel account will change as of the audit of the 2024 financial statements. The new lead partner has been selected. The Audit Committee also started the preparations for mandatory auditor rotation. The external audit firm will be replaced as of the audit of the 2026 financial statements. The external auditor selection process has started and will largely take place during 2024, for submission and approval at the AGM in 2025. Further details on the external auditor can be found in the Corporate governance statement.\n\n## Risk management and internal control systems\n\nThe Audit Committee reviewed the company's overall approach to governance, risk management and internal controls, its processes, outcomes, financial and sustainability reporting and disclosures. It received regular updates from internal auditors and functions, and was provided with comprehensive risk and internal control reports during the year. In addition, the Audit Committee received periodic updates on the results of testing of internal control effectiveness, related remediation plans and assessments of overall control effectiveness. In its review, the Audit Committee considered the impact of\n\nchanges to systems, processes and organization, such as the integration of the Grupo Orbis processes. The Audit Committee also met regularly with senior executives.\n\nIn fulfilling its oversight responsibilities in relation to risk management and internal control systems, the Audit Committee also received updates from functions such as Finance, Treasury, Information Management and Tax throughout the year. In addition, the Audit Committee reviewed the proposed budget and operating plan. During 2023, the Audit Committee received several updates on the IT security framework, including the corporate security program and the security program for the manufacturing sites.\n\n## Integrity and compliance\n\nThe Executive Committee is responsible for maintaining a culture of integrity and ensuring an effective integrity and compliance program and control framework. Part of these responsibilities are delegated to specific committees and the Integrity and Compliance team. The Supervisory Board's Audit Committee oversees this responsibility and reviews the regular integrity and compliance reports.\n\n## Internal audit\n\nThe Internal Auditor presented all main audit findings to the Audit Committee and discussed the progress of the audit plan. During the year, the Audit Committee approved Internal Audit's plan and strategy, and also agreed on the budget and resource requirements for the function. The Audit Committee met separately with the Internal Auditor during the year to discuss the results of the audits performed and the status of the follow-up on action plans identified. In 2023, the Audit Committee was satisfied with the effectiveness of the Internal Audit function. With the former Head of Internal Audit leaving AkzoNobel, the Audit Committee supported the succession of the Head of Internal Audit per March 1, 2023, which was subsequently approved by the Supervisory Board.\n\n## Results and financial statements\n\nBefore each publication of the quarterly results and the financial statements, the Audit Committee reviewed the financial results. In addition, the Audit Committee reviewed and commented on the interim and final dividend proposals and on reports and press releases to be published. This was in addition to the work undertaken by the company's Disclosure Committee in reviewing the company's disclosure of potentially share price sensitive information. Based on these discussions, the Audit Committee advised the Supervisory Board on the publications and disclosures, as well as on proposals regarding the interim and final dividends. All quarterly and annual releases of financial results were approved by the full Supervisory Board prior to publication and release.\n\nTo ensure its effectiveness and expertise, the Audit Committee was provided with regular updates on IFRS developments and the anticipated impact of these developments on the financial statements. In addition, the Audit Committee reviewed and assessed management assertions made in regard to relevant accounting treatments. The external auditor, as required by auditing standards, also considers the risk of management override of controls. Nothing has come to the attention of the Audit Committee to suggest any material misstatement related to suspected or actual fraud involving management override of controls.\n\n## Sustainability reporting\n\nThe Audit Committee advised on the company's roadmap in anticipation of the upcoming sustainability reporting frameworks. It received bi-annual updates on the progress made in relation to CSRD compliant reporting and reviewed and discussed the process and outcome of the double materiality assessment in light of CSRD. For more information, see the Sustainability statements.",

The Remuneration Committee also reviewed various incentive plans, the economic circumstances and the relative performance compared with top peers.\n\n## Remuneration Policy review\n\nIn 2023, the Remuneration Committee and Supervisory Board reviewed the remuneration policies for the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board to assess whether these were still in line with the company's strategy and financial targets. Following such review, the Supervisory Board will propose amendment of the remuneration policies for the Board of Management and Supervisory Board for consideration by shareholders at the 2024 AGM. Further information can be found in the Remuneration report.\n\n## Management salary review\n\nThe Remuneration Committee reviewed the base salaries and established relevant forward-looking target ranges for variable remuneration of Board of Management members and other Executive Committee members. The base salaries will continue to be assessed in light of market conditions, the reward structures of peer group companies and performance. The Remuneration Committee considered the pay ratios within the company and how these compare with peer group companies. Forwardlooking target ranges for variable remuneration of the Board of Management were discussed. Further information can be found in the Remuneration report.\n\n| Remuneration Committee activities 2023 Q1                                       | Q2 and Q3                                                                                                                          | Q4                                                                                                                                               |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| \u00b7 Review of management performance 2022 shares under Long-term Incentive Plan   | \u00b7 Review Remuneration Policy for Board of Management and Supervisory  Board \u00b7 Target setting 2023 \u00b7 Supervisory Board remuneration | \u00b7 Preparation of 2023 Remuneration report \u00b7 Review of 2023 (preliminary) performance outlook Board \u00b7 Review of management base salaries for 2024 |\n| \u00b7 Approval of 2022 pay-out under Short-term Incentive Plan and vesting of       |                                                                                                                                    |                                                                                                                                                  |\n|                                                                                 |                                                                                                                                    | \u00b7 Review Remuneration Policy for Board of Management and Supervisory                                                                             |\n| \u00b7 Review of CFO remuneration                                                    |                                                                                                                                    |                                                                                                                                                  |\n| \u00b7 2022 Remuneration report \u00b7 Review Remuneration Policy for Board of Management |                                                                                                                                    |                                                                                                                                                  |\n| \u00b7 Target setting 2023                                                           |                                                                                                                                    |                                                                                                                                                  |\n| \u00b7 TSR peer group review                                                         |                                                                                                                                    |                                                                                                                                                  |",

        "page_content": "## CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT\n\nAkzoNobel aspires to the highest standards of corporate governance and seeks to consistently enhance and improve corporate governance performance, emphasizing transparency and a culture of sustainable long-term value creation.\n\nAkzo Nobel N.V. is a public limited liability company (naamloze vennootschap) established under the laws of the Netherlands, with common shares listed on Euronext Amsterdam. AkzoNobel has a sponsored level 1 American Depositary Receipt (ADR) program and ADRs can be traded on the international OTCQX platform in the US.\n\nThe company's management and supervision are organized under Dutch law in a so-called two-tier system, comprising a Board of Management (solely composed of executive directors) and a Supervisory Board (solely composed of non-executive directors). The Supervisory Board supervises and advises the Board of Management and ensures a strong external presence in the governance of the company. The two Boards are independent of each other and are accountable to the Annual General Meeting of shareholders (AGM) for the performance of their functions.\n\nOur corporate governance framework is based on the company's Articles of Association, the requirements of the Dutch Civil Code, the Dutch Corporate Governance Code 2022 (the 'Code') and all applicable laws and regulations, including securities laws. The Code contains principles and best practices for Dutch companies with listed shares. Deviations from the Code are explained in accordance with the Code's 'comply or explain' principle.\n\nWith the exception of those aspects of our governance which can only be amended with the approval of the AGM, the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board may make adjustments to the way the Code is applied, if this is\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nconsidered to be in the best interests of the company. Where changes are made, these will be reported and explained in the annual report for the relevant year and discussed at the subsequent AGM.\n\nIn 2022, a revised version of the Code was published by the Corporate Governance Code Monitoring Committee (www.mccg.nl). The revised Code was implemented with effect from January 1, 2023, and focuses on sustainable long-term value creation and related reporting, diversity and inclusion, and other relevant topics. A review of the company's corporate governance framework and systems in the context of compliance with the Code was performed and a gap analysis was carried out highlighting certain areas or practices that required amendment. The gap analysis was reviewed by the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board and relevant revisions to existing\n\npractices were implemented. In addition, the revised Code has been reflected in the Rules of Procedure of the Board of Management and the Rules of Procedure of the Supervisory Board, which are both available on our website.\n\nThe company also subscribes to, and applies, the principles of the VNO-NCW Tax Governance Code. Further information on this is available on our website: AkzoNobel's approach to tax. For the full version of the Tax Governance Code, visit www.vno-ncw.nl/ taxgovernancecode",

        "page_content": "|\n\n|\n\n## Board of Management and Executive Committee\n\nThe Board of Management is entrusted with the management of the company. When it comes to the management of our business, it operates in the context of an Executive Committee. The Executive Committee comprises the Board of Management and other key officers of the company, led by the CEO.\n\nThe composition of the Executive Committee ensures that functional, operational and commercial expertise is entrenched at the highest level of the organization. Among other responsibilities, the Board of Management defines the company's strategic direction. It establishes and maintains internal policies and procedures for effective risk management and control, manages the realization of the company's operational and financial targets, its sustainability performance and its pursuit of sustainable long-term value creation. In fulfilling their duties, Board of Management members are assisted by the Executive Committee and guided by the interests of the company and its affiliated enterprises, taking into consideration the relevant interests of the company's stakeholders.\n\nThe Board of Management takes precedence; all Executive Committee decisions require a majority of the Board of Management members. The Board of Management can decide to reserve decisions for itself. The Board of Management members remain accountable for all decisions made by the Executive Committee. The Board of Management is accountable for its performance to the Supervisory Board and is accountable to the shareholders of the company at the AGM. The Executive Committee members who are not also Board of Management members, and the CFO, report to the CEO.\n\nThe Supervisory Board has regular, direct interaction with Executive Committee members, and all Executive Committee members attend most Supervisory Board meetings.\n\nThe CEO leads the Executive Committee in its overall management of the company. He is the main point of liaison with the Supervisory Board. The CFO is responsible for overseeing AkzoNobel's finances, its corporate control, investor relations and information management.\n\nThe tasks, responsibilities and procedures of the Board of Management and Executive Committee are set out in their Rules of Procedure. These rules have been approved by the Supervisory Board and are available on our website. Authority to represent the company is vested in the two members of the Board of Management, acting jointly. The Board of Management has also delegated a level of authority to corporate agents, including members of the Executive Committee. The list of authorized signatories is available from the Dutch Chamber of Commerce.\n\nThe Directors of the company's business units and the Corporate Directors in charge of the different functions report to individual Executive Committee members with specific responsibility for their activities and performance.\n\n## Appointment\n\nBoard of Management members are appointed and removed from office by the AGM. The current Board of Management members were first appointed by Extraordinary General Meetings (EGMs) held in 2022 and 2017, with the CFO having been reappointed for another four-year term at the 2022 AGM. The other Executive Committee members are appointed by the CEO, after consultation with the Supervisory Board. Board of Management members are in principle appointed for a term not exceeding four years, with the possibility of reappointment.\n\nAs described later in this section, the Meeting of Holders of Priority Shares has the right to make binding nominations for the appointment of members of the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board. However, as the company subscribes to the principles of the Code in general, members of the Supervisory Board and the Board of Management are (with the exception of those\n\ncircumstances described later in this section) appointed on the basis of non-binding nominations by the Supervisory Board. In such cases, resolutions to appoint a member of the Supervisory Board or the Board of Management require a simple majority of the votes cast by shareholders.\n\nUnder certain conditions specified in the Articles of Association, shareholders may also be entitled to nominate Supervisory Board or Board of Management members for appointment. Such appointments require a two-thirds majority, representing at least 50% of the outstanding share capital, in order to be adopted at an AGM (or EGM).\n\n## Diversity and inclusion\n\nAkzoNobel believes in the strength of diversity and inclusion and, in accordance with the Code, a policy on diversity and inclusion has been adopted for the composition of the Board of Management and the Executive Committee.\n\nThe policy on diversity and inclusion for the composition of the Board of Management and Executive Committee is recognized and described in the Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Policy (DE&I Policy) for the executive level, Board of Management and Supervisory Board, as published on our website. The objective of this DE&I Policy is to enrich the Board of Management and Executive Committee's perspective, improve performance, increase member value and enhance the probability of achievement of the company's goals and objectives.\n\nA consistent and structured approach is applied to succession planning for the Board of Management and Executive Committee, taking into account the implementation of the relevant DE&I Policy.\n\nAkzoNobel currently diverges from the gender target of at least 30% female and at least 30% male Board of Management members. This is primarily due to the size of the Board of Management being only two members. This divergence is justified and has ensured the best",

        "page_content": "|\n\n|\n\ncandidates for the roles were nominated by the Supervisory Board and appointed by shareholders.\n\nAkzoNobel ended 2023 with a gender diversity of 11% female representatives at Executive Committee level. In February 2023, the composition of the Executive Committee changed after expanding it to include four existing business leaders. Although this impacted the gender diversity balance, it was deemed to be in the company's best interest to increase business representation at Executive Committee level. The percentage improved in January 2024 to 22%. This still diverges from the gender target of at least 30% female and at least 30% male Executive Committee members. Succession planning efforts are in place to ensure continued improvement of the gender balance in the future.\n\nDetailed information on DE&I, including targets and plans and initiatives to reach such targets, can be found in the Sustainability statements and on our website.\n\n## Outside directorships\n\nSpecific rules on outside board positions of the Executive Committee members - which are more stringent than the requirements of the Dutch Civil Code - can be found in the Rules of Procedure.\n\n## Conflicts of interest\n\nDuring 2023, no transactions were reported under which a member of the Board of Management or Executive Committee had a conflict of interest which was of material significance to the company and to the relevant member.\n\n## Remuneration\n\nThe current Remuneration Policy for the Board of Management was last amended in full following approval by the AGM in 2021, and last updated at the AGM in 2022. The details of this policy can be found in the Remuneration report. The service contracts of the Board of Management members contain change of control\n\nprovisions. Further details can be found in the Remuneration report and Note 25 of the Consolidated financial statements. The service contracts of the Board of Management are compliant with the Code. The main elements of these contracts are available on our website.\n\n## Operational Control Cycle\n\nThe Executive Committee holds regular meetings to discuss the implementation of the company's strategy and functional agendas. Additional meetings are held to discuss specific topics as required. The Board of Management and Executive Committee have delegated authorities to individual Executive Committee members and to certain committees and councils. To help plan for success and ensure alignment within the entire AkzoNobel organization on the strategic and operational plan, an Integrated Business Planning (IBP) process is in place across the company's global businesses and functions. IBP provides, on a monthly basis, visibility on the longterm integrated business and financial plan, which covers the product portfolio, demand and supply. It therefore ensures early attention and remedial actions, where appropriate, on any potential gaps. The monthly IBP cycle ends with a review by the Executive Committee, where it assesses the consolidated long-term company perspective, including risks and opportunities, decides on escalation and possible scenarios and supervises the key performance indicators with corrective actions, if applicable.\n\n## Culture\n\nThe Board of Management and Executive Committee promote openness and engagement through a SpeakUp! grievance mechanism and have established a Code of Conduct, policies, rules and procedures incorporated in the company's Policy framework, in order to drive a culture of good governance, consistency and functional excellence. The values of good governance, sustainability and teamwork adopted by the Board of Management are incorporated in these documents. The Board of Management believes these values contribute to a culture focused on sustainable long-term value creation and\n\nactively encourages these values through leading by example.\n\nA strong company culture fostering a solid and wellembedded balance between performance and organizational health is highly valued by the Board of Management and Supervisory Board, and is fundamental to AkzoNobel's strategic approach. Our company culture forms an important part of discussions involving internal organizational changes and Human Resources strategy updates, as well as any functional updates. Since 2018, surveys have been conducted involving all employees, covering a variety of focus areas, such as our wider organizational health (see Employee engagement in the Sustainability statements). The Executive Committee and Supervisory Board regularly discuss the results of such surveys, the targets and the actions taken to achieve those targets.\n\nWe were involved in the Who's That Girl research project, which has been investigating Vermeer's famous painting The Girl With the Pearl Earring. The Mauritshuis in the Netherlands has been using advanced techniques to discover what the artwork would have looked like when it was completed in 1665. Our paint experts were brought in to test how much the painting's color and gloss have faded over the centuries.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Given the focus on sustainability, overall ownership of sustainability is with the CEO.\n\nProgress regarding sustainability objectives, development, target setting and implementation is reviewed on a quarterly basis by the Executive Committee and the Supervisory Board. Regular deep dives on specific sustainability topics are carried out to ensure there's appropriate expertise in the Executive Committee and Supervisory Board to manage and oversee sustainabilityrelated matters, and to assess any associated material impacts, risks and opportunities. Several bodies report via the Director of Sustainability to the Executive Committee and Supervisory Board, including the Raw Material Sustainability Group (RMSG) and the CSRD Steering Committee. Further details are included in the Sustainability statements.\n\nThe latest exhibition from the AkzoNobel Art Foundation, entitled eARTh - A Collective Landscape, was opened at our head office in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. Featuring work from 41 established and up-and-coming artists, it offers an opportunity for visitors to emotionally engage with our natural surroundings to better understand the challenges we're all facing.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Audit Committee takes an active role in assessing the quality and reliability of sustainability reporting and receives bi-annual updates from the CSRD Steering Committee. External auditor PwC has been engaged to perform a limited assurance engagement on specific indicators included in the Sustainability statements. Their report can be found in the Financial information.\n\n## Committees\n\n## Integrity and Compliance governance committees\n\nThe Executive Committee is responsible for maintaining a culture of integrity and ensuring an effective Integrity and Compliance program and framework and has delegated part of the responsibilities to specific committees. The Supervisory Board's Audit Committee oversees this responsibility. More details on the Integrity and Compliance governance committees can be found on page 82.\n\n## Executive Pensions Committee\n\nThe Executive Pensions Committee oversees the general pension policies of AkzoNobel's various pension plans and their financial consequences for the company. The committee is chaired by the CFO and includes the Chief Human Resources Officer and senior executives with a background in corporate law, treasury, pensions and rewards.\n\n## Disclosure Committee\n\nThe Board of Management has established a Disclosure Committee, which consists of senior executives with a background in corporate law, finance and investor relations. The task of the Disclosure Committee is to establish and maintain disclosure controls and procedures, and to advise the CEO, CFO and General Counsel on the accurate and timely disclosure of material financial and non-financial information.\n\n## Supervisory Board\n\nThis section provides an overview of the responsibilities and governance of the Supervisory Board. For an understanding of the activities of the Supervisory Board over the past year, refer to the Statement of the Chair of the Supervisory Board and the Report of the Supervisory Board.\n\nThe responsibility of the Supervisory Board is to supervise the policies adopted by the Board of Management and the Executive Committee and to oversee the general conduct of the business of the company. In practice, this means supervising:\n\n- \u00b7 The corporate strategy\n- \u00b7 The achievement of the company's operational and financial objectives\n- \u00b7 The design and effectiveness of internal risk management and control systems\n- \u00b7 The main financial parameters, compliance with applicable laws and regulations and risk factors\n\nThe Supervisory Board advises the Board of Management and Executive Committee, while taking into account the interests of the company and its stakeholders. Major investments, acquisitions and functional initiatives are subject to Supervisory Board approval.\n\nThe Supervisory Board is governed by its Rules of Procedure (available on our website). The Rules of Procedure include the profile and charters of the Committees, which set out the tasks and responsibilities of the Supervisory Board, and its operational processes.\n\n## Composition\n\nIn compliance with the Dutch Civil Code, the Supervisory Board has a balanced composition reflecting the nature and variety of the company's businesses, their international spread and expertise in fields such as finance, economics, societal, environmental and legal aspects of business, government and public administration.",

The skills matrix can be found on page 70.\n\nIn addition, in accordance with the Code, a policy on diversity and inclusion has been adopted for the composition of the Supervisory Board in the DE&I Policy for the executive level, Board of Management and Supervisory Board. The objective of this policy is to ensure a balanced composition, taking account of nationality, age, gender, education and work background. For 2023, there are no divergences to report. With five male and three female members, the Supervisory Board complied with the requirements of the Dutch Gender Diversity Bill.\n\nSupervisory Board\n\n37.5%\n\n62.5%\n\nFemale\n\nMale\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWhen nominating and selecting new candidates for the Supervisory Board, we take into account the Supervisory Board profile and skills matrix, the requirements of the Act on Management and Supervision, the principles and provisions of the Code, as well as the DE&I Policy for the executive level, Board of Management and Supervisory Board.\n\n## Appointment\n\nSupervisory Board members are nominated, appointed and dismissed in accordance with procedures identical to those previously outlined for the Board of Management members. In accordance with the Code, Supervisory Board members are eligible for re-election once for a period not exceeding four years. Members may be reelected a second time for a period of two years. This period may be extended by two years at the most. In the event of a reappointment after an eight-year period, reasons must be given in the Report of the Supervisory Board. Terms of appointment are based on a reappointment scheme, available on our website. In 2023, one appointment and two reappointments to the Supervisory Board were proposed to, and approved by, the AGM held on April 21, 2023.\n\n## Induction and training\n\nFollowing appointment to the Supervisory Board, new members receive a comprehensive induction tailored to their individual needs. This includes extensive briefings about all major business and functional aspects of the company and its corporate governance and compliance requirements. The induction includes meetings with the CEO, CFO, all other Executive Committee members and relevant members of senior management, as well as site visits. This enables new Supervisory Board members to quickly build up an understanding of AkzoNobel's businesses and strategy, as well as the key risks and issues the company faces. In addition, the Chair ensures the Supervisory Board is provided with regular updates, attends business unit deep dives and ensures that the Supervisory Board undertakes training, for example in the area of compliance and ethics and sustainability\n\n(reporting). To the extent required, separate training sessions outside of regular Supervisory Board meetings can be arranged by the company.\n\n## Conflict of interest\n\nSupervisory Board members may not participate in the discussions and decision-making on a subject or transaction in relation to which they have a conflict of interest with the company. Decisions to enter into transactions under which Supervisory Board members have conflicts of interest that are of material significance to the company, and to the relevant Supervisory Board member, require the approval of the Supervisory Board. Any such decisions will be recorded in the annual report for the relevant year, with reference to the conflict of interest and a declaration that the relevant best practice provisions of the Code have been complied with. During 2023, no transactions were reported under which a Supervisory Board member had a conflict of interest which was of material significance to the company and to the relevant member.\n\n## Remuneration of the Supervisory Board\n\nSupervisory Board members receive a fixed annual remuneration and attendance fee, which is determined by the AGM. According to the Code, it is not possible for members to be remunerated in shares. The current Remuneration Policy for the Supervisory Board was last amended in full following approval by the AGM in 2021. More information on the remuneration of Supervisory Board members and the Remuneration Policy of the Supervisory Board can be found in the Remuneration report and Note 25 of the Consolidated financial statements.",

Information on the activities, composition and attendance of the Supervisory Board members at the meetings of the committees during the year is set out in the Report of the Supervisory Board. Each committee has a charter describing its role and responsibilities, as well as the manner in which it discharges its duties and reports to the full Supervisory Board. These charters are included in the Rules of Procedure of the Supervisory Board. The committees report on their deliberations and findings to the full Supervisory Board.\n\n## Shareholders and the Annual General Meeting\n\nThe AGM is an integral part of the governance of the company and its system of checks and balances. The AGM reviews the annual report and decides on the adoption of the financial statements and the dividend proposal, as well as the discharge and (re)appointment of members of the Supervisory Board and Board of Management. The AGM is convened by public notice and the agenda, notes to the agenda and the procedure for attendance and voting at the meeting are published in advance and posted on our website. Matters proposed for consideration, approval or adoption are tabled as separate agenda items and explained in writing in advance of the meeting.\n\nThese proposals include, where relevant:\n\n- \u00b7 Adoption of the financial statements\n- \u00b7 Dividend proposal\n- \u00b7 Discharge of members of the Supervisory Board and Board of Management\n- \u00b7 (Re-)election of members of the Board of Management and Supervisory Board\n\n- \u00b7 Advisory vote on Remuneration report\n- \u00b7 Other important matters, such as major acquisitions or the sale or demerger of a substantial part of the company, as required by law\n- \u00b7 Authorization of the Board of Management to issue new shares\n- \u00b7 Authorization of the Board of Management to repurchase shares\n- \u00b7 Remuneration of Supervisory Board members\n- \u00b7 Material changes to the Remuneration Policy of the Board of Management\n- \u00b7 Amendments to the Articles of Association (for more details, see art. 57 of the Articles of Association, available on our website)\n\nThe company provides remote voting possibilities to its shareholders. Holding shares in the company on the record date determines the right to exercise voting rights and other rights relating to the AGM. All resolutions are made on the basis of the 'one share, one vote' principle (assuming an equal par value for each class of shares). All resolutions are adopted by absolute majority, unless the law or the company's Articles of Association stipulate otherwise. Holders of common shares in aggregate representing at least 1% of the total issued capital, or, according to the Official List of Euronext Amsterdam N.V., representing a value of at least \u20ac50 million, may submit proposals for the AGM agenda. Such proposals must be adequately substantiated and submitted in writing, or electronically, to the company at least 60 calendar days in advance of the meeting. Draft minutes of the AGM are made available on our website within three months of the meeting date. The final minutes are made available online within six months of the meeting date.\n\n## Share classes\n\nAkzoNobel has three classes of shares: common shares, cumulative preferred shares and priority shares. Common shares are traded on the Euronext Amsterdam stock exchange. Common shares are also traded over-thecounter on OTCQX in the US in the form of American Depositary Receipts (each American Depositary Receipt\n\nrepresenting one-third of a common share). On December 31, 2023, a total of 170.6 million common shares and 48 priority shares had been issued. This includes shares held in treasury which cannot be voted on and which are not eligible for dividend. Shareholders owning 3% or more of the issued capital and/or voting rights must report this to the Dutch Authority for the Financial Markets (AFM) as soon as the threshold is reached or exceeded. Relevant reporting by shareholders can be found in the 'Register of substantial holdings and gross short positions' at www.afm.nl\n\nThe majority of shares in AkzoNobel N.V. are included in a global certificate and held through the system maintained by the Dutch Central Securities Depository (Euroclear Nederland). In the past, Akzo Nobel N.V. also issued (physical) bearer share certificates (Bearer Certificates). A limited number of Bearer Certificates have not yet been surrendered to Akzo Nobel N.V., although holders of Bearer Certificates are entitled to a corresponding number of shares in Akzo Nobel N.V. It is noted that, as a result of Dutch legislation which became effective as of July 2019, the relevant shares were registered in the name of Akzo Nobel N.V. by operation of law as per January 1, 2021. Pursuant to this legislation, owners of Bearer Certificates will continue to be entitled to a corresponding number of shares in Akzo Nobel N.V. until January 2, 2026. On that date, their entitlement will expire by operation of law.\n\n## Related information\n\nFor more details about AkzoNobel shares and Bearer Certificates, contact Investor Relations:\n\ninvestor.relations@akzonobel.com\n\nThe priority shares are held by the Foundation Akzo Nobel (Stichting Akzo Nobel). The priority shares are limited in transferability and profit entitlement (see Note F of the Company financial statements).

The Meeting of Holders of Priority Shares has the nomination right for the appointment of members of the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board, as well as the right to approve amendments to the Articles of Association of the company.\n\nNo cumulative preferred shares have been issued to date. Cumulative preferred shares merely have a financing function, which means if necessary, and possible, they will be issued at or near the prevailing quoted price for common shares.\n\nThe AGM held on April 21, 2023, authorized the Board of Management for a period of 18 months after that date or, if earlier, until the date on which the AGM again renews the authorization - subject to approval from the Supervisory Board - to issue shares in the capital of the company free from pre-emptive rights, up to a maximum of 10% of the issued share capital. The Board of Management was also given a mandate to acquire and to cancel held or acquired common shares in the company's share capital. The maximum number of shares that the company will hold in its own share capital at any time shall not exceed 10% of its issued share capital.\n\n## Anti-takeover provisions and control\n\nAccording to the Code, the company is required to provide an overview of its actual or potential anti-takeover measures, and to indicate in what circumstances it's expected they may be used. The priority shares may be considered to constitute a form of anti-takeover measure, in relation to the right of the Meeting of Holders of Priority Shares to make binding nominations for appointments to the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board. The Foundation Akzo Nobel has confirmed that it intends to make use of such rights in exceptional circumstances only. These circumstances include situations where, in the opinion of the Board of the Foundation, the continuity of the company's management and policies is at stake.\n\nThis may be the case if a public bid for the common shares of the company has been announced, or has been made, or the justified expectation exists that such a bid will be made, without any agreement having been reached in relation to such a bid with the company. The same shall apply if one shareholder, or more shareholders acting in a concerted way, hold a substantial percentage of the issued common shares of the company without making an offer. Or if, in the opinion of the Board of the Foundation Akzo Nobel, the exercise of the voting rights by one shareholder or more shareholders, acting in a concerted way, is materially in conflict with the interests of the company. In such cases, the Supervisory Board and the Board of Management, in accordance with their statutory responsibility, will evaluate all available options with a view to serving the best interests of the company, its shareholders and other stakeholders.\n\nThe Board of the Foundation Akzo Nobel has reserved the right to make use of its binding nomination rights for the appointment of members of the Supervisory Board and of the Board of Management in such circumstances. Although a deviation from provision 4.3.3 of the Code, the Supervisory Board and the Board of Management are of the opinion that these provisions will enhance the continuity of the company's management and policies. In the event of a hostile takeover bid, or other action which the Board of Management and Supervisory Board consider adverse to the company's interests, the two Boards reserve the right to use all available powers (including the right to invoke a response time in accordance with provisions 4.1.6 and 4.1.7 of the Code), while taking into account the relevant interests of the company and its affiliate enterprises and stakeholders.\n\n## Auditors\n\nThe external auditor is appointed by the AGM on proposal of the Supervisory Board. An annual evaluation of the external auditor is reviewed by the Audit Committee and reported on to the Supervisory Board. The external auditor attends all meetings of the Audit Committee, and the meeting of the Supervisory Board at which the financial statements are approved. During these meetings, the auditor discusses the outcome of the audit procedures and the reflections thereof in the auditors' report. In particular, the key audit matters are highlighted. The auditor receives the financial information and underlying reports of the quarterly figures and can comment on and respond to this information. The external auditor is present at the AGM and shareholders may ask questions with regard to the audit.\n\n## Auditor independence\n\nThe Audit Committee and Board of Management report their dealings with the external auditor to the Supervisory Board annually, and also discuss the external auditor's independence.\n\n## Other services\n\nOne area of particular focus in corporate governance is the independence of the auditors. The Audit Committee has been delegated direct responsibility for the compensation and monitoring of the auditors and the services they provide to the company. Pursuant to the Audit Profession Act, the auditors are prohibited from providing the company with services in the Netherlands other than 'audit services aimed at providing assurance concerning the information supplied by the audited client for the benefit of external users of this information and also for the benefit of the Supervisory Board as referred to in the reports mentioned'.\n\nThe company has taken the position that no additional services may be provided by the external auditor and its global network that do not meet these requirements,",

The aforementioned rules are available on our website.\n\n## Internal Audit\n\nThe Internal Audit function is mandated to provide the Board of Management, Executive Committee and Audit Committee with independent, objective assurance on the adequacy of the design and operating effectiveness of the Internal Control Framework described below. The Internal Auditor reports to the Board of Management and has direct access to the Audit Committee and its Chair. The function performs its mandate based on a risk-based audit plan, which is approved by the Board of Management and the Audit Committee. It reports the audit findings quarterly to the Board of Management, Executive Committee and the Audit Committee, which culminates in an annual assessment of the quality and effectiveness of the company's internal control systems.\n\n## Share dealing rules and rules on disclosure control\n\nIn accordance with Dutch Iaw and regulations (including the European Market Abuse Regulation), the company maintains insider lists and exercises controls around the dissemination and disclosure of potentially price sensitive information.\n\nAll employees and the members of the Board of Management, Executive Committee and Supervisory Board, are subject to the AkzoNobel Share Dealing Rules, which limit their opportunities to trade in AkzoNobel securities. Transactions in AkzoNobeI shares carried out by Board of Management, Executive Committee and Supervisory Board members (including their closely associated persons) are, as and when required, notified to\n\nthe Dutch Authority for the Financial Markets (AFM). The Board of Management, Executive Committee and Supervisory Board members require authorization from the General Counsel prior to carrying out any transactions in respect of AkzoNobeI securities, even in a so-called 'open period'. In relevant cases, the General Counsel can prohibit carrying out transactions in respect of other companies' securities. In addition, all employees are subject to the AkzoNobeI Rules on Disclosure Control.\n\n## Internal controls and risk management\n\n## Internal controls\n\nThe company has adequate processes and procedures for internal controls. The Board of Management and Executive Committee have established several Risk, Control and Compliance Committees, which are explained on page 82. In 2023, we continued to invest in enhancing our Internal Control Framework and processes, including further leveraging system embedded and system enabled controls, standard role design and segregation of duties monitoring, helping us to prevent fraud and reputational damage. An integrated Risk and Internal Control department supports all businesses and functions in their work.\n\n## Risk management\n\nOur risk management system is explained in more detail in the next chapter. Reference is made to the Statement of the Board of Management relating to internal risk management and control systems.\n\nOur Coral brand in Brazil partnered with Mattel to produce a real-life Barbie color range.

We strive to be a successful and respected company and seek to take a balanced risk approach. Risk management is an essential element of our corporate governance and strategy development. We continuously strive to foster a high awareness of business risks and internal control to provide transparency in our processes and operations. AkzoNobel complies with the risk management requirements of the Dutch Corporate Governance Code 2022. The Board of Management and Executive Committee are responsible for managing the risks associated with our strategic objectives and the establishment and adequate functioning of\n\nappropriate risk management and control systems (see Statement of the Board of Management).\n\n## Risk management framework\n\nOur risk management framework is in line with the Enterprise Risk Management - Integrated Framework of COSO and the Corporate Governance Code. It's an embedded, company-wide activity, focused on the areas of main risk exposure and provides reasonable assurance that our business objectives can be achieved and our obligations to customers, shareholders, employees and society can be met. The process consists of risk appetite setting by the Executive Committee to serve as input for our strategy and general risk management approach, followed by structured risk assessments applying a topdown and bottom-up approach, and the management and monitoring of identified risks. The risk management framework is discussed twice a year with the Supervisory Board. For more information on our risk management framework, visit the Risk management section on our website.\n\n## Risk management in 2023\n\nAkzoNobel's risk appetite differs depending on the type of risk. We believe we must operate within the dynamics of the paints and coatings industry and take the risks needed to ensure our relevance in the market. At the same time, topics related to our core values and company purpose require a different risk appetite.\n\nDuring 2023, we held a significant number of enterprise risk workshops across the organization, as well as project, transition and fraud risk workshops. Risks were identified by responsible management teams and functional experts, followed by the definition of adequate mitigating actions. We consider risk assessment and mitigation to be a continuous process, carried out against the background of\n\nan evolving risk landscape, which includes short, medium and longer term challenges.\n\nThe symbols alongside the risk descriptions that follow represent management's assessment of risk development, compared with 2022. During the assessment, both our internal and external environment were taken into account.

In 2023, we had committees in place in all eight business units, the Integrated Supply Chain organization and certain specific countries. The committees consist of business unit\n\nleadership and key corporate function leaders, including the Integrity and Compliance managers. The committees drive the operationalization of the Integrity and Compliance (I&C) program into the organization, with a strong focus on prevention. The committees discuss trends, identify, prioritize and address risks and share learnings from investigations to drive continuous improvement. In 2023, each business unit committee conducted an I&C risk assessment. For more information on the I&C risk assessment, see the following Risk management paragraph. The committees meet at least on a quarterly basis.\n\n## Integrity and Compliance SpeakUp! Committee\n\nThis committee reviews investigations into SpeakUp! reports involving alleged violations of our Code of Conduct and applicable laws. The committee also decides on discipline and control improvement actions, as well as monitoring and responding to any trends identified in investigations. Cases are generally decided by the SpeakUp! Committee, with certain limited exceptions for: (1) Certain regulatory matters where subject matter expertise is needed, which go to the General Counsel; (2) Certain lower risk cases, which may be decided by the leader of the business unit or function in whose organization the alleged violation occurred. The latter cases are reviewed by the SpeakUp! Committee. The centrally established Integrity and Compliance SpeakUp! Committee ensures transparency and consistency of disciplinary actions throughout the organization.\n\nIn 2023, there were no individual matters or disciplinary actions discussed with the committee that would warrant separate disclosure in the annual report. Should there be material compliance matters, or material internal control weaknesses or improvements in the future, these will be addressed through the Risk, Control and Compliance Committees (see next column) and discussed with the Audit Committee and external auditor, and where appropriate disclosed in accordance with the applicable legal requirements.\n\n## Risk, Control and Compliance Committees (RCC)\n\nThe RCCs are responsible for supervising the effectiveness of the control environment and reviewing weaknesses in this environment, enabling more robust prioritization and progress. There are eight business unit RCCs and seven functional RCCs, in addition to a Group RCC. They each met quarterly in 2023.\n\n## Privacy Committee\n\nResponsible for supervising the company's privacy framework and driving the further improvement of the Privacy program. For more information on our key privacy activities, see the following Privacy program paragraph.\n\n## Integrity and Compliance team\n\nThe day-to-day management of our Integrity and Compliance program is delegated to the Integrity and Compliance team - which is led by the Director of Integrity and Compliance, who reports to the General Counsel. The team includes experts in integrity and compliance program design, legal experts in the field of competition law, antibribery and anti-corruption and data privacy, as well as our Integrity and Compliance managers in all regions driving the implementation and further tailoring of the program to address local risks.\n\nTo ensure the company maintains and strengthens its culture of integrity, the Integrity and Compliance team together with various other functions and stakeholders across the organization - focuses its efforts on the following key areas:\n\n- \u00b7 Help leaders set a strong tone at the top and lead by example\n- \u00b7 Drive awareness and ownership of all employees through effective policy management, training and communication\n- \u00b7 Design and implement effective controls\n- \u00b7 Risk management",

        "page_content": "|\n\n|\n\n- \u00b7 Investigations of SpeakUp! matters with a focus on identifying control action items and sharing lessons learned\n- \u00b7 Driving continuous improvement\n\nThe regional Integrity and Compliance managers contribute to further strengthening the culture of integrity. This includes identifying and addressing local risks and cooperating with the business and functional teams to tailor the program to local risks and follow up on internal audit findings and SpeakUp! cases. In 2023, the heads of Integrity and Compliance, Internal Control and Internal Audit met at least quarterly to discuss findings and trends, and to align actions. The Director of Integrity and Compliance also met at least quarterly with the Human Rights team and Export Control and Sanctions team to discuss the priorities in these areas and the impact of geopolitical developments.\n\n## Risk management\n\nThe business unit Integrity and Compliance governance committees play a key role in the Integrity and Compliance risk assessments, which are led by the Integrity and Compliance team. A new Integrity and Compliance risk assessment process was rolled out in 2023, which involved asking the business unit Integrity and Compliance governance committees to identify and prioritize key risks and define action plans and owners to mitigate these risks. Each committee has approved its business unit specific risk remediation plan, and the outcome of all Integrity and Compliance risk assessments serves as the basis to identify the priorities for 2024 and onwards.\n\n## Policy management\n\nAll AkzoNobel policies, rules and procedures are available on the Policy Portal. In 2023, a backend tool was developed to automate and standardize document lifecycle management, including revisions to documents and archiving of previous versions of documents.\n\n## Communication\n\nWe have further strengthened our communication program by launching various new initiatives to reach more colleagues and raise greater awareness. Although no major risks or issues were identified in the SpeakUp! cases, to continuously ensure a strong tone from the top and drive improvement, we launched a series of SpeakUp! videos. They are short films in which senior leaders share lessons learned from SpeakUp! cases and offer guidance on how to prevent future misconduct. In addition, we continued sharing ethical dilemmas and SpeakUp! Insights, a quarterly case-sharing program through which we ask our leaders to discuss the learnings with their teams and encourage speaking up, along with various campaigns dedicated to particular topics. In 2023, we developed an interactive online game (the Integrity Fun Fair) for our Integrity Day campaign, to refresh people's memories about key integrity and compliance risks in the areas of competition law, data privacy, anti-bribery and anti-corruption.\n\n## Training and education\n\nIn addition to online training, targeted audience training on key integrity and compliance topics/risks continued to be delivered as part of the mandatory Integrity and Compliance training curriculum. Also in 2023, a new Code of Conduct training was launched with targeted versions for both online and offline workers.\n\n## Competition law program\n\nCompliance with competition law and competing fairly remains a top priority for our company. We have undertaken a series of initiatives aimed at fostering a culture of competition law compliance throughout the organization. A particular focus has been conducting training and creating materials relating to risks around information exchange and careful communications. Additionally, we've strengthened our dedicated competition law team responsible for providing support to the broader legal function and business. They're tasked with actively identifying potential risks and areas for improvement, and working on prevention and mitigation strategies. Furthermore, we've maintained an open channel for reporting and addressing potential concerns. We've conducted assessments of proposed strategic initiatives and commercial developments, with a particular emphasis on key markets, ensuring that they align with competition laws. The competition law aspects of M&A activity, and subsequent integrations, continue to be a focus area.\n\n## Privacy program\n\nIn 2023, we focused on further strengthening awareness on data privacy with those teams dealing with personal data on a regular basis. We also introduced two targeted privacy e-learnings: one for HR, focusing on employee personal data, and another for Sales and Marketing, emphasizing customer data handling. As part of the further standardization and automation of our data privacy program, we continued the global roll-out of our advanced and partly automated centralized process for managing customer data subject requests.",

        "page_content": "|\n\n|\n\n## Anti-bribery and anti-corruption program\n\nDuring the year, we launched a new gifts and hospitality e-learning, along with new gift and conflict of interest registration tools (including a pre-approval workflow). Going forward, we'll add more specific controls for other anti-bribery and anti-corruption areas, such as donations, sponsorships and hospitality. This will help us to strengthen our controls, monitor compliance with our policies, rules and procedures and enable data gathering, analysis and reporting.\n\n## Third-party risk management (TPRM) program\n\nFollowing the TPRM program re-design in 2022, we acquired a new TPRM platform, with integrated TPRM screening software and enhanced due diligence reporting capability. We focused on implementation activities in 2023, aiming for a global roll-out of the revamped TPRM program in 2024. We managed to create a highly automated and efficient risk-based end-to-end TPRM program, with critical interface to the CRM (Customer Relationship Management). At the end of 2023, we kicked off a pilot to test the program design, target operating model and monitor volumes. In addition, we applied an interim third-party screening process targeting the highest risk partners across the company. To increase awareness on the topic of TPRM, a chapter has also been included in our Code of Conduct training.\n\n## Monitoring\n\nWe have several processes to monitor compliance with our rules and procedures by employees and business partners. Employees are informed about this through the Employee Privacy Statement. Managers are also required to self-assess and confirm compliance with company key controls as part of the internal control self-assessment. From a competition law perspective, we also run amnesty programs for newly acquired businesses as part of the integration process into the wider group.\n\nThe Internal Audit function performs numerous audits on our operations. Their audit plan is risk-based and takes account of prior compliance and internal control findings. Internal audits were also held or covered specific risks - at the request of the Integrity and Compliance function - to validate compliance with our rules and procedures in certain units, or on certain risk areas.\n\n## Grievance and investigation\n\nOur SpeakUp! grievance mechanism offers employees and third parties a means to raise allegations relating to compliance with our Code of Conduct and violations of applicable laws and regulations.\n\nOur dedicated investigation team follows an investigation protocol which adheres to strict principles of confidentiality, respect for anonymity, non-retaliation, objectivity and the right to be heard. The investigation program has been updated to reflect the EU Whistleblower Directive, as transposed into national laws. In 2023, the\n\ntotal number of reports across all channels increased slightly. This was driven by several factors, including increased communication on the SpeakUp! process, increased management reporting of alleged violations and use of the system to report concerns or general enquiries unrelated to the Code of Conduct, which are referred to the appropriate subject matter expert. All reports and alerts led to 39 dismissals, along with various other disciplinary measures and control improvements, confirming the value of the company's grievance framework.\n\n## Reporting\n\nDuring 2023, the Director of Integrity and Compliance reported every four months to the Executive Committee and the Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board on material developments of the Integrity and Compliance program. Material investigation matters, if any, are discussed with our external auditor on a quarterly basis.\n\nThere were no individual matters or disciplinary actions discussed with the Integrity and Compliance SpeakUp! Committee that would warrant separate disclosure in the annual report. Should there be material compliance matters or material internal control weaknesses or improvements in the future, these will be addressed through the RCCs and discussed with the Audit Committee and external auditor and, where appropriate, disclosed in accordance with the applicable legal requirements.",

        "page_content": "## REMUNERATION REPORT\n\n## Letter from the Chair of the Remuneration Committee\n\n## Dear stakeholders\n\nOn behalf of the Remuneration Committee, I'm pleased to introduce AkzoNobel's 2023 Remuneration report. In this report, the company outlines the implementation of its remuneration policies in 2023. The 2023 Remuneration report will be subject to an advisory vote at our 2024 AGM.\n\n## Our business context in 2023\n\nIn response to the challenges posed by an unpredictable macro-economic landscape, AkzoNobel outlined a set of strategic priorities designed to guide with resilience and adaptability.\n\nOverall, the company did well in 2023 and is making good strides forward, with stabilizing volumes and profits rebounding positively. This was mainly driven by resilient pricing and the first effects of raw material deflation. These developments offset lower demand in some of our markets and adverse currency exchange effects.\n\nAn industrial excellence plan has been launched, which is aimed at reducing complexity, enhancing productivity and optimizing our network through the investment and modernization of our anchor sites. We recognize there's significant value to be gained through improving our industrial processes and this plan is a key long-term strategic priority for the company.\n\nIn order to better understand our opportunities, a review of AkzoNobel's portfolio was carried out. Following this review, the company moved decisively to strengthen the Decorative Paints business in China through the\n\nacquisition of the Huarun business. Although we mutually agreed with Kansai Paint not to proceed with our intended acquisition of its paints and coatings activities in Africa, AkzoNobel remains committed to its strong businesses and leading brands in Africa. This will also bring the company's debt reduction targets forward, which will help to resume a normative capital allocation.\n\nAkzoNobel also presented a comprehensive roadmap for its focus products, outlining strategic initiatives for each. These included acceleration plans for technology development and the launch of innovative and sustainable products, such as internal coatings for beverage cans that are free of intentionally added bisphenols, low-cure powder coatings and biocide-free antifoulings.\n\nIn the second half of the year, the company launched a new comprehensive employee engagement survey, underlining its commitment to understand and improve employee satisfaction and engagement. With a participation rate of 89% and a level of engagement well above the average of the companies in the benchmark, AkzoNobel put in place a basis to ensure continuous improvement for the business.\n\n## Our stakeholder engagement\n\nThe company is pleased that the 2022 Remuneration report received a positive advisory vote at the 2023 AGM, with a majority vote of 92.74%.\n\n## 2023 AGM stakeholder engagement\n\nAkzoNobel engaged with various stakeholders in preparation for the 2023 AGM. These conversations mainly focused on concerns raised by several shareholders concerning continuity of leadership and, in particular, with regard to the retention of the CFO. While the importance of continuity of leadership was recognized by our stakeholders, during these conversations it also\n\nbecame clear there was no strong support for introducing retention measures. The Remuneration Committee took that feedback under advisement and decided not to award retention-related compensation in 2023, nor do we intend to in 2024.\n\n## Remuneration report disclosure\n\nFollowing the ongoing stakeholder dialogs, we implemented several changes in our 2022 Remuneration report to improve disclosure on performance outcomes and Remuneration Committee decision-making.\n\nFurther changes have been introduced in this year's disclosures to improve the transparency and readability of the 2023 Remuneration report. These changes include using a new reporting format, providing additional context on Remuneration Committee decisions made, structuring the use of tabular and textual information and using more visuals. We've also have changed our long-term incentive (LTI) section in accordance with the vesting of the 2021-2023 LTI Plan. This is the first award for which the updated performance metrics derived from the company's strategic plan were in place.\n\n## Decisions made on remuneration\n\n## Board of Management\n\nThe 2023 remuneration outcomes for the CEO and CFO are determined in accordance with the Remuneration Policy for the Board of Management, which was last amended in full following approval by the AGM in 2021, and last updated at the AGM in 2022.\n\nIn 2023, the CEO, Greg Poux-Guillaume, earned a base salary of \u20ac1,225,000. As per January 1, 2023, the CFO, Maarten de Vries, received a base salary of \u20ac749,600. To ensure that the salaries of the members of the Board of Management were still at the market median level of our peer group, the Remuneration Committee performed a",

        "page_content": "|\n\n|\n\nbroader review of the base salaries. This review is carried out once every three years, the last time being in 2020. As per May 1, 2023, the CFO's base salary was increased to \u20ac830,000, to bring his compensation in line with the market. Following this increase, the CFO's salary is in line with the market median of our peer group and therefore in accordance with the principles of our Remuneration Policy for the Board of Management. The CEO's salary did not require an increase in 2023 as the review confirmed that it was in line with the market median of the peer group.\n\nIn 2023, the achievement on the short-term incentive metrics was above target for both financial objectives. The non-financial objectives for the members of the Board of Management were also evaluated above target on average, resulting in an overall above target pay-out of 126.48%. More details can be found in the section on short-term incentives.\n\nVesting under the 2021-2023 LTI Plan was limited to the performance on revenue growth and Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) metrics, with details provided in the section on long-term incentives.\n\n## Supervisory Board\n\nThe 2023 remuneration outcomes for Supervisory Board members are determined in accordance with the Remuneration Policy for the Supervisory Board, which was last amended in full following approval by the AGM in 2021. No adjustments were made during the year, hence the application was in line with previous years.\n\n## Implementation of our remuneration policies in 2024\n\nAkzoNobel will submit a proposal to change the LTI performance measures and their weighting for shareholders to approve at our 2024 AGM. Aligning with our recently announced mid-term ambitions, and in\n\naccordance with recent discussions with our shareholders, AkzoNobel intends to remove revenue growth as a metric for LTI. This metric uses a calculated competitive benchmark based on our competitors' limited disclosures. Lack of market information forces us to make certain assumptions to render competitors' information comparable, making the KPI less objective and less reliable. While growth remains a priority, it's captured in the absolute EBITDA metric, which remains. Should shareholders approve the proposed amendment, vesting of the conditional grant will be linked to adjusted EBITDA (33%), ROI (33%) and ESG (34%), increasing the importance of ESG as a confirmation of our commitment to our sustainability targets.\n\nThe Remuneration Committee carried out a benchmark in 2023 on the Supervisory Board remuneration levels. For comparability in board structure and responsibilities, remuneration levels were only compared with those companies in the peer group with a two-tier board. The benchmark used for this exercise does not include American companies, but Dutch and European companies only. Following the outcome of this review, AkzoNobel intends to submit a proposal to increase the annual retainer and committee fees of the Supervisory Board members at the 2024 AGM. The proposed fees take into consideration that the remuneration levels for the Supervisory Board were last amended in 2021.\n\nNo further changes are envisioned for both the Board of Management and Supervisory Board remuneration policies. An overview of the remuneration in 2024 is included in the Remuneration Policy for 2024 section.\n\n## Dick Sluimers\n\nChair of the Remuneration Committee",

As no shares became unconditional in 2022, the value in the table is zero.\n\nThis section presents insights into how the Remuneration Policy for the Board of Management was implemented in 2023. Actual remuneration was determined in line with the Remuneration Policy and no derogation of the policy has been applied. The Supervisory Board has conducted scenario analyses when determining the (variable) remuneration outcomes. This included the assessment on remuneration outcomes under the various performance scenarios and the impact of share price development (threshold and below, at-target and maximum).\n\n## Base salary\n\nIn 2023, CEO Greg Poux-Guillaume earned a base salary of \u20ac1,225,000, while CFO Maarten de Vries' base salary was adjusted in two steps to \u20ac830,000. The first was in accordance with the salary adjustments applied for AkzoNobel employees in the Netherlands and made as per January 1, 2023. To ensure that the salaries of the members of the Board of Management were still at the market median level of our peer group, the Remuneration Committee performed a broader review of the base salaries. This review is carried out every three years and was previously done in 2020. As per May 1, 2023, the\n\nCFO's base salary was increased to \u20ac830,000. Following this increase, the CFO's salary is in line with the market median of our peer group and therefore in accordance with the principles of our Remuneration Policy for the Board of Management. The CEO's salary did not require an increase as the review confirmed that the salary was in line with the market median of the peer group.",

The remaining 30% is measured on quantifiable non-financial objectives. For the financial objectives, 40% is based on adjusted operating income (OPI) and 30% is based on free cash flow (FCF). For the non-financial objectives, a combination of individual objectives for both the CFO and CEO were selected. These objectives have been organized around three priorities related to people, transformation and portfolio management. The allocation of percentages to each category suggests a balanced approach, reflecting a comprehensive strategy aimed at organizational growth, employee engagement and technological advancement.\n\nThe first objective relates to people. It was measured on employee engagement, the ability to develop leaders from within the organization - rather than through external recruitment - and the strengthening of the Executive Committee. This objective, which accounted for 40% of the individual objectives, was achieved at 150%. In terms of measuring employee commitment, three indicators were used: (1) Participation in the Voices employee engagement\n\nsurvey, which was targeted at 75% (the actual participation rate was 89%). (2) The rate of commitment, with a target set at the benchmark for industrial companies. This rate was exceeded, with an outcome of 4.0, compared with a benchmark of 3.8. (3) The net promoter score, which was measured +11, compared with -2 for similar companies. All indicators were measured by an external and independent company.\n\nIn terms of development of the executive employee group, 79% of the positions that became available during the year were filled by internal candidates, compared with 50% in 2022. The third indicator related to strengthening Executive Committee skills and business representation involved several new appointments. Until the start of 2023, the composition of the Executive Committee had been predominantly functional. The addition of four new members in 2023 - who manage the Decorative Paints EMEA, Decorative Paints Latin America, Marine and Protective Coatings, and Automotive and Specialty Coatings businesses - has strengthened the business orientation of the company's strategic decisions. The management team has also been strengthened in some key functions: General Counsel and Chief Human Resources Officer.\n\nThe second objective was industrial excellence, which accounted for 30% of the individual objectives and was assessed at 100%. A new industrial excellence plan was defined, aiming for a benefit of \u20ac250 million by 2027, with the first milestones scheduled for 2024. Productivity increased by 2.8% and OTIF (on-time, in-full) passed the 80% mark, while inventory levels decreased from \u20ac1,843 million to \u20ac1,649 million between 2022 and 2023.\n\nThe final personal objective, called Portfolio and technology, accounted for 30% and was also evaluated at 100%. The focus of this objective was on the launch of innovative and sustainable products or solutions. The following innovations were among those launched during the year: internal coatings for beverage cans that are free from intentionally added bisphenols, a range of low-energy powder coatings, and a biocide-free antifouling.\n\nFollowing the end of the performance year, the Supervisory Board assessed the delivered performance against the targets set. The tables below summarize the achieved performance.\n\n## STI on financial objectives\n\n| Performance metric      | Weighting   |                      | Threshold   | Maximum   | Performance   | Pay-out (as a % of  target)   |\n|-------------------------|-------------|----------------------|-------------|-----------|---------------|-------------------------------|\n| Adjusted OPI (in \u20ac mln) | 40%         | Corresponding target | 368         | 1,118     | 1,074         |                               |\n|                         |             | Corresponding award  | 0%          | 150%      | 141%          | 56.48%                        |\n| FCF (in \u20ac mln)          | 30%         | Corresponding target | 400         | 950       | 840           |                               |\n|                         |             | Corresponding award  | 0%          | 150%      | 113%          | 34.00%                        |\n| Total financial         | 70%         |                      |             |           | 129%          | 90.48%                        |",

This results in the following STI pay-out:\n\n- \u00b7 Greg Poux-Guillaume: \u20ac1,549,380\n- \u00b7 Maarten de Vries: \u20ac812,678.\n\nIn determining the outcome of the STI elements, the Remuneration Committee applied a reasonableness test in which the actual level of performance was critically assessed in light of the assumptions made at the beginning of the year.\n\n## Share-Matching Plan\n\nThe Share-Matching Plan reiterates the importance of share ownership, which underpins alignment over the long term. In addition to the required investment of 25% of STI proceeds (net after tax and other deductions), both the CEO and CFO decided to invest another 25%, totaling 50% of total net STI proceeds for 2023.\n\nThe Share-Matching Plan was suspended for STI payments made in the years 2019, 2020 and 2021. For this reason, no matching shares were received by Board of Management members in 2023.\n\nIn 2023, the 2,708 potential matching shares that were granted to Thierry Vanlancker were pro-rated, resulting in 903 potential matching shares. These shares were\n\nmatched upon termination of the management agreement in April 2023.\n\n## Long-term incentives (LTI)\n\n## Vesting of the 2021-2023 LTI Plan\n\nUnder the 2021-2023 LTI Share Plan, a conditional grant of 12,369 shares was made to the CFO. As the CEO joined AkzoNobel on October 1, 2022, no conditional grant was made in 2021 to him under this LTI share plan. Under the 2021-2023 LTI Plan, a conditional grant of 26,713 shares was made to the former CEO. The 26,713 shares that were conditionally granted in 2021 have been pro-rated, calculated over the period until the end of the management agreement in April 2023, to respectively 20,777 (28/36 of 26,713) conditional shares.\n\nIn line with the Remuneration Policy for the Board of Management applicable at date of award, the performance measures (and underlying metrics) were determined as included in the table on the next page.\n\nAt date of award, the Supervisory Board has determined for each measure (i) the performance level below which no shares vest; (ii) the performance level at which the target number of shares vest and (iii) the performance level at which the maximum number of shares vest.\n\nFollowing the end of the performance period of the 2021-2023 LTI Share Plan, the Supervisory Board assessed the delivered performance against the targets set.\n\nThe Supervisory Board set the threshold for adjusted EBITDA at \u20ac1.5 billion and the maximum at \u20ac2 billion. The threshold for ROI was set at 15% and the maximum at 20%. As both adjusted EBITDA and ROI performance were below threshold in 2023, the corresponding vesting percentage for these specific parts of the LTI is 0%.\n\nRevenue growth as weighted average is compared with a defined industry peer group, consisting of the following companies in the paints and coatings sector: SherwinWilliams, Nippon Paint, PPG, Axalta and BASF Coatings. Organic growth rates to calculate the performance take into consideration price, mix, volume growth and exclude the effects of exchange rates and mergers and acquisitions. For Axalta and Sherwin-Williams, only organic growth percentage of the Performance Coatings business growth is taken into consideration. Performance on this metric is measured against 33 months following the start of the conditional period for Nippon Paint and BASF Coatings. The Supervisory Board set the threshold for revenue growth at -1.0% and the maximum at 1.0%. With a revenue growth of -0.91% compared to market, the realization on this metric is 9%.",

Performance excludes acquisitions representing more than 2% of revenues. Actual performance on Total waste (circular) was below threshold, resulting in no vesting percentage for this ESG metric.

The minimum shareholding requirement must be accrued within five years. This includes privately purchased shares and vested shares granted under AkzoNobel share-based compensation plans. The overview above provides insight into Board of Management share ownership practices as per December 31, 2023.\n\n## Claw back, value adjustment and loans\n\nIn 2023, there was no cause for a claw back or value adjustment by the Remuneration Committee. The company does not grant loans, advance payments or guarantees to members of the Board of Management or any family member of such persons.\n\n## Former members of the Board of Management\n\nFollowing the disclosure in the 2022 Remuneration report, termination of Thierry Vanlancker's management agreement was executed in accordance with the management agreement and the Remuneration Policy for the Board of Management. In accordance with this management agreement, Thierry Vanlancker was entitled\n\nto his base salary, post-contract and fringe benefits until the end of the management agreement at the AGM in April 2023. Furthermore, he received a severance payment of one annual base salary (not exceeding one annual base salary, in accordance with the Dutch Corporate Governance Code 2022). These payments, together with post-contract and fringe benefits, amounted to a total of \u20ac1,619,598, as provided for in the 2022 Remuneration report. No STI awards or payments were made in 2023. No shares were conditionally granted under the 2023-2025 LTI Plan.\n\nThe 26,713 shares that were conditionally granted to Thierry Vanlancker under the 2021-2023 LTI Plan have been pro-rated, calculated for the period until the end of the management agreement in April 2023, to respectively 20,777 (28/36 of 26,713) conditional shares, resulting in a vesting of 2,745 shares as further explained in the LTI section. In addition, the 2,708 potential matching shares that were granted to Thierry Vanlancker were pro-rated, resulting in 903 potential matching shares. These shares were matched upon termination of the management agreement in April 2023, as also disclosed in the ShareMatching Plan section. The total value of all shares that became unconditional during the year is \u20ac272,943. This means that the value of the total remuneration received in 2023 amounts to \u20ac1,892,541.\n\n## Contractual arrangements\n\nThe overview above provides insight into the main contractual arrangements of the Board of Management.\n\n## Comparative information\n\n## Pay ratios\n\nInternal pay ratios are a relevant input factor for determining the appropriateness of the implementation of the Remuneration Policy for the Board of Management, as recognized in the Corporate Governance Code. In 2023, the ratio between the annual total compensation for the CEO and the average annual compensation for an employee was 85.8 (2022: 59.8). This pay ratio was calculated in accordance with the guidance as provided in the Corporate Governance Code. In addition, CEO pay ratios on the basis of median employee remuneration have been calculated.",

This volatile business climate had a severe impact on the results of the company. Consequently, all financial components of the short and long-term incentives did not meet the threshold and delivered no pay-out. The annualized total compensation for Thierry Vanlancker reduced by 65% compared with 2021, to \u20ac1,912,210 versus \u20ac5,514,195 in the previous year. This reflects the fact that his short-term incentive paid out around half and no shares granted under the LTI plan 2020 vested. Compared with 2021, the annualized total compensation for Maarten de Vries reduced by 48%\n- \u00b7 In response to the challenges posed by an unpredictable macro-economic landscape, we outlined a set of strategic priorities designed to guide us with resilience and adaptability. This resulted in above target pay-out on the financial metrics of the short-term incentive.

At the AGM in 2022, an amendment regarding the STI metrics in the Remuneration Policy for the Board of Management was approved. Operating cash flow (OCF) has been replaced by free cash flow (FCF). The amended Remuneration Policy for the Board of Management became effective (retroactively) from January 1, 2022, and will remain effective until a new Remuneration Policy for the Board of Management is approved, which will be proposed to shareholders no later than the AGM in 2025.\n\n## Remuneration Policy for the Board of Management\n\nThe Supervisory Board has concluded the Remuneration Policy for the Board of Management is in line with the company's objectives. The remuneration it provides is balanced and adequate. For implementation in 2024, the Supervisory Board has decided that:\n\n- \u00b7 The CEO's base salary will be increased by 5.3%, reflecting the fact that the initial salary was set in 2022 and had not been adjusted in 2023. The 5.3% increase is below the salary adjustments applied for AkzoNobel employees in the Netherlands\n- \u00b7 No change in base salary will be made for the CFO, as his salary was adjusted in line with the benchmark in May 2023\n- \u00b7 Metrics applied for STI will remain the same, to support the company's strategy and will continue to apply in 2024\n- \u00b7 Metrics applied for LTI in 2023 were adjusted EBITDA, ROI, revenue growth and ESG. Aligning to our recently announced mid-term ambitions, and in accordance\n\nwith recent discussions with our shareholders, it will be proposed to remove revenue growth as a metric for LTI. This metric is based on a calculated competitive benchmark based on our competitors' limited disclosures. Lack of market information forces us to make certain assumptions to render competitor information comparable, making the KPI less objective and less reliable. While growth remains a priority, it's captured in the absolute EBITDA metric, which remains. This suggested change in LTI metrics in the Remuneration Policy for the Board of Management will be submitted to the 2024 AGM for approval. Should shareholders approve the proposed amendment, vesting of the conditional grant will be linked to adjusted EBITDA (33%), ROI (33%) and ESG (34%), increasing the importance of ESG as a confirmation of our commitment to our sustainability targets",

There is a clear distinction in remuneration between mainly Dutch companies with a two-tier board structure and other companies within the peer group that have a one-tier board structure, the latter having predominantly higher remuneration levels for supervisory board members. The remuneration of the Supervisory Board seems to be on average somewhat below median compared with companies with a two-tier board structure and we will, therefore, propose to increase the remuneration levels for the Supervisory Board as set out in the table below. This proposal takes into consideration that the remuneration levels for the Supervisory Board were last amended in 2021. The suggested change in the Remuneration Policy for the Supervisory Board will be submitted to the 2024 AGM for approval.\n\n## Supervisory Board fee proposal\n\n|                 | Fixed base fee   | Fixed base fee   | Fixed base fee   | Remuneration/   | Remuneration/   | Remuneration/   | Remuneration/   |\n|-----------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n|                 | Chair            | Deputy Chair     | Member           | Chair           | Member          | Chair           | Member          |\n| Proposed amount | \u20ac162,000         | \u20ac100,000         | \u20ac86,000          | \u20ac27,000         | \u20ac22,000         | \u20ac22,000         | \u20ac16,000         |",

        "page_content": "## NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## Note 1: SUMMARY OF MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\n## General information\n\nAkzo Nobel N.V. is a public limited liability company headquartered in the Netherlands. The address of our registered office is Christian Neefestraat 2, Amsterdam; the Chamber of Commerce number is 09007809. We have attached a list of subsidiaries and associated companies, drawn up in conformity with Articles 379 and 414 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code, as an appendix to our annual report. The principal activity of AkzoNobel is the production and selling of paints and coatings.\n\nWe have prepared the Consolidated financial statements of Akzo Nobel N.V. in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union (IFRS). The Consolidated financial statements also comply with the financial reporting requirements included in Title 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code.\n\nThe management report within the meaning of Article 391 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code consists of the following parts of the annual report:\n\n- \u00b7 2023 results at a glance\n- \u00b7 CEO statement\n- \u00b7 How we created value\n- \u00b7 Strategy and operations\n- \u00b7 Sustainability statements\n- \u00b7 Leadership and governance: Our Board of Management and Executive Committee\n- \u00b7 Leadership and governance: Statement of the Board of Management\n- \u00b7 Leadership and governance: Corporate governance statement\n- \u00b7 Leadership and governance: Risk management\n- \u00b7 Leadership and governance: Integrity and compliance management\n- \u00b7 Leadership and governance: Remuneration report\n- \u00b7 Financial information: Note 5 Operating income\n- \u00b7 Financial information: Note 26 Financial risk management\n- \u00b7 Appendix: EU taxonomy\n\nOn February 26, 2024, the Board of Management authorized the financial statements for issue. The financial statements as presented in this report are subject to adoption by the Annual General Meeting of shareholders on April 25, 2024.\n\n## Going concern\n\nThe Consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, resulting from management's assessment of the ability of AkzoNobel to continue its operations for the foreseeable future.\n\nManagement has assessed the ability of AkzoNobel to continue as a going concern based on an evaluation of, among others, the financial position, expected future cash flows and market developments.\n\nAt December 31, 2023, cash and cash equivalents were \u20ac1.5 billion. We also assessed the ability of the company to obtain financing, taking into account the company's external credit rating, which we are committed to retain at strong investment grade.\n\nExpected future cash flows are based on the latest forecasts. These forecasts take into account internal and external developments relevant in the assessment of the ability of AkzoNobel to continue as a going concern, including but not limited to market developments, developments in the macro-economic environment (e.g. inflation, see disclosure on inflation in this Note) and climate-related developments (see disclosure on climate change in this Note).\n\nManagement's assessment did not lead to uncertainties in relation to AkzoNobel's ability to continue as a going concern.\n\n## Impact of climate change\n\nThe potential effects on the financial statements of climate change have been assessed. This assessment included the impact of physical risks, such as those associated with water scarcity, flooding and weather events, as well as transitional risks that may lead to changes in technology, market dynamics and regulations. A desktop study was performed relating to physical climate risks. We also considered AkzoNobel's commitments to reduce carbon emissions as approved by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi), and related estimates as to investments and the timing thereof. The resulting impact on the financial statements, including in the areas of fixed assets depreciation and recoverability assessments, was not deemed material to the company's financial position and results of operations as of, and for the year ended, December 31, 2023.",

        "page_content": "## NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## Impact from the war in Ukraine and sanctions on Russia\n\nOur business in Ukraine and Russia combined represented less than 2% of our 2023 revenue (2022: about 2%), of which the vast majority concerned Russia.\n\nIn 2022, following the EU sanctions, the majority of our Performance Coatings activities in Russia were suspended. The residual Russian business since then has been locally operated. AkzoNobel has assessed the potential accounting impact from the localization of the Russian business. Taking into account the applicable IFRS standards, we have concluded that our Russian business can still be included in our scope of consolidation.\n\nNo significant impairments of assets occurred in Russia in either 2023 or 2022; in Ukraine, the value of the assets is immaterial.\n\n## Impact of inflation\n\nThe financial year 2023 saw continued inflation due to geo-political and macro-economic developments. The impacts from rising inflation have been considered in the financial statements where relevant. Reference is made to Note 5 Operating income on financial developments during the year, Note 7 Financing income and expenses, Note 10 Intangible assets on the annual impairment testing process, Note 15 Inventories on the impact of raw material price increases, Note 18 Post-retirement benefit provisions on the impact of inflation rates on the defined benefit obligations (DBO) and Note 26 Financial Risk Management on sensitivities in relation to changes in interest rates.\n\n## Consolidation\n\nThe Consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Akzo Nobel N.V. and its subsidiaries. Subsidiaries are companies over which Akzo Nobel N.V. has control, because it is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the subsidiary and it has the ability to affect returns through its power over the subsidiary. Non-controlling interests in equity and in results are presented separately.\n\n## Changes in accounting policies and first-time application\n\nAccounting pronouncements with potential relevance for AkzoNobel, which became effective for 2023, include IFRS 17 'Insurance contracts' and amendments to this standard, amendments to IAS 8 'Definition of accounting estimates', amendments to IAS 1 and IFRS Practice Statement 2 'Disclosure of Accounting Policies', amendments to IAS 12 'Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising from a Single Transaction' and 'International Tax Reform - Pillar Two Model Rules'. These changes in accounting policies had no material impact on our Consolidated financial statements. With regards to the exemption for recognizing and disclosing information about deferred tax assets and liabilities related to Pillar Two income taxes, as per the amendments to IAS 12, reference is made to Note 8 Income tax.\n\n## Discontinued operations/Held for sale\n\nA discontinued operation is a component of our business that represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations that has been disposed of, or is held for sale, or is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale. Assets and liabilities are classified as held for sale if it is highly probable that the carrying value will be recovered through a sale transaction within one year, rather than through continuing use. When reclassifying assets and liabilities as held for sale, we recognize the assets and liabilities at the lower of their carrying value or fair value less costs to sell. Assets held for sale are not depreciated and amortized but tested for impairment. In case of discontinued operations, the comparative figures in the Consolidated statement of income and Consolidated statement of cash flows are re-presented. The Consolidated balance sheet comparative figures are not re-presented.\n\n## Use of estimates\n\nThe preparation of the financial statements in compliance with IFRS requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the financial statements. The estimates and assumptions are based on experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances and are used to judge the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. The most critical accounting policies involving a higher degree of judgment and complexity in applying principles of valuation and for which changes in the assumptions and estimates",

Determining the fair value requires significant judgments on future cash flows to be generated.\n\nGoodwill in a business combination represents the excess of the consideration paid over the net fair value of the acquired identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities. If the cost of an acquisition is less than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired, the difference is recognized directly in the statement of income.\n\nThe fair value of brands, customer relationships and know-how acquired in a business combination is estimated using generally accepted valuation methods. These include the relief-from-royalty method, the incremental cash flow method and the multi-period excess earnings method.\n\nThe fair value of property, plant and equipment acquired in a business combination is based on estimated market values.\n\nThe fair value of inventories acquired in a business combination is determined based on estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated costs of completion and sale and a reasonable profit margin, based on the effort required to complete and sell the inventories.\n\n## Statement of cash flows\n\nWe have used the indirect method to prepare the statement of cash flows. Cash flows in foreign currencies have been translated at transaction rates. Acquisitions or divestments of subsidiaries are presented net of cash and cash equivalents acquired or disposed of,\n\nrespectively. Cash flows from derivatives are recognized in the statement of cash flows in the same category as those of the hedged items.\n\n## Operating segments\n\nWe determine and present operating segments based on the information that is provided to the Executive Committee, our chief operating decision-maker during 2023, to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segments and assess their performance. Segment results reported to the Executive Committee include items directly attributable to a segment, as well as those items that can be allocated on a reasonable basis.\n\n## Foreign currencies\n\nTransactions in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency using the foreign exchange rate at transaction date. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates at the balance sheet date. Resulting foreign currency differences are included in the statement of income in financing income and expenses. Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rate at acquisition date.\n\nThe assets and liabilities of entities with other functional currencies are translated into euros, the functional currency of the parent entity, using the exchange rates at the balance sheet date. The income and expenses of entities with other functional currencies are translated into the functional currency, using the exchange rates at transaction date.\n\nForeign exchange rate differences resulting from translation into the functional currency of investments in subsidiaries and of intercompany loans of a permanent nature with other functional currencies are recorded as a separate component (cumulative translation reserve) within other comprehensive income. These cumulative translation adjustments are reclassified (either fully or partly) to the statement of income upon disposal (either fully or partly) or liquidation of the foreign subsidiary to which the investment or the intercompany loan with a permanent nature relates. Foreign currency differences arising on the translation of a financial liability designated as an effective hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation are recognized in the cumulative translation reserve (in Other comprehensive income).",

In addition, exchange rates at this balance sheet date are used to translate both the balance sheet and the statement of income into euros. Hyperinflation accounting is applied for Argentina and T\u00fcrkiye based on the historical cost approach and using the Consumer Price Index (CPI).

Although the transfer of risks and rewards is not the only criterion to be considered to determine whether control over the goods has transferred, it is in most situations considered to be the main indicator of the customer's ability to direct the use of, and obtain the benefits from the asset, and largely also coincides with the physical transfer of the goods and the obligation of the customer to pay.\n\nVariable considerations, including among others rebates, bonuses, discounts and payments to customers, are accrued for as performance obligations are satisfied and revenue is recognized. Variable considerations are only recognized when it is highly probable that these are not subject to significant reversal. In case of expected returns, revenue is not recognized for such products. Instead, we record a liability for the refund and an asset for the products that will be returned. A provision for warranties is recognized when the underlying products or services are sold, generally based on historical warranty data. Revenue is recognized net of rebates, discounts and similar allowances, and net of sales tax.\n\n## Equipment provided to customers\n\nAkzoNobel regularly provides mixing machines, store interior and other assets to its customers at the start of a paints or coatings delivery contract. The delivery of such assets qualifies as a separate performance obligation. Revenue can only be recognized at the moment of transfer of such assets, when there is an agreed sales price or when there is a binding take-or-pay commitment for a minimum quantity of paints or coatings to be acquired by the customer.\n\n## Services\n\nAkzoNobel provides certain training, technical or support services to customers, as well as shipping and handling activities for its customers. Service revenue is recognized over time when the related services are being provided. When not separately invoiced, part of the sales price of paints or coatings is allocated to such services.",

        "page_content": "## NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## Post-retirement benefits (Note 6, 18)\n\nContributions to defined contribution plans are recognized in the statement of income as incurred.\n\nMost of our defined benefit pension plans are funded with plan assets that have been segregated in a trust or foundation. We also provide post-retirement benefits other than pensions to certain employees, which are generally not funded. Valuations of both funded and unfunded plans are carried out by independent actuaries, based on the projected unit credit method. Post-retirement costs primarily represent the increase in the actuarial present value of the obligation for projected benefits, based on employee service during the year and interest on the net defined benefit liability/asset. When the calculation results in a benefit to AkzoNobel, the recognized asset is limited to the present value of economic benefits available in the form of any future refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan. An economic benefit is available if it is realizable during the life of the plan, or on the settlement of the plan liabilities. The effect of these so-called asset ceiling restrictions and any changes therein are recognized in Other comprehensive income. Remeasurement gains and losses, which arise in calculating our obligations, are recognized in Other comprehensive income. When the benefits of a plan improve, the portion of the increased benefits related to past service by employees is recognized as an expense in the statement of income immediately. We recognize gains and losses on the curtailment or settlement of a defined benefit plan when the curtailment or settlement occurs.\n\nInterest on the net defined benefit liability/asset is included in financing expenses related to post-retirement benefits. Other charges and benefits recognized are reported in operating income, unless recorded in other comprehensive income.\n\n## Other employee benefits (Note 6, 19)\n\nProvisions for other long-term employee benefits are measured at present value, using actuarial assumptions and methods. Any actuarial gains and losses are recognized in the statement of income in the period in which they arise.\n\n## Share-based compensation (Note 6)\n\nAkzoNobel has a performance-related and a restricted share plan, as well as a sharematching plan, under which equity-settled shares are granted to certain employees. The fair value is measured at grant date and amortized over the three-year period during which the\n\nemployees normally become unconditionally entitled to the shares with a corresponding increase in shareholders' equity. Amortization is accelerated in the event of earlier vesting or settlement.\n\n## Income tax (Note 8)\n\nIncome tax expense comprises both current and deferred tax, including effects of changes in tax rates. In determining the amount of current and deferred tax, we also take into account the impact of uncertain tax positions and whether additional taxes may be due. Income tax is recognized in the statement of income, unless it relates to items recognized in other comprehensive income or equity.\n\nCurrent tax includes the expected tax payable and receivable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at reporting date, as well as (any adjustments to) tax payables and receivables with respect to previous years.\n\nDeferred tax is recognized using the liability method on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the Consolidated financial statements. We do not recognize deferred tax for the initial recognition of goodwill, the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit, and differences related to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future and we can control the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference. Deferred tax assets are recognized for unused tax losses, tax credits and deductible temporary differences, to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which they can be utilized.\n\nAkzoNobel has applied the exemption for recognizing and disclosing information about deferred tax assets and liabilities related to Pillar Two income taxes.\n\nMeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities is based upon the enacted or substantively enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which temporary differences are expected to be reversed. Deferred tax positions are not discounted.\n\n## Earnings per share (Note 9)\n\nBasic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit for the period attributable to shareholders of the company by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year, adjusted for any repurchased shares.

        "page_content": "## NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nshare is calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year for the diluting effect of the shares of the performance-related share plan, the restricted share plan and the share-matching plan.\n\nAdjusted earnings per share represents the basic earnings per share from continuing operations excluding identified items, after taxes.\n\n## Government grants\n\nGovernment grants related to costs are deducted from the relevant costs to be compensated in the same period. Government grants to compensate for the cost of an asset are deducted from the cost of the related asset. Emission rights granted by the government are recorded at cost. A provision is recorded if the actual emission is higher than the emission rights granted.\n\n## Intangible assets (Note 10)\n\nIntangible assets are valued at cost less accumulated amortization and impairment charges. Intangible assets with an indefinite useful life, such as goodwill and certain brands, are not amortized, but tested for impairment annually using the value-in-use method.\n\nIntangible assets with a finite useful life, such as licenses, know-how, certain brands, customer relationships, intellectual property rights, emission rights, software expenditures (in as far as AkzoNobel controls the software configured or customized) and capitalized development costs, are capitalized at historical cost and amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the assets, which generally ranges from 5 to 40 years for brands with finite useful lives, 5 to 25 years for customer relationships, and 3 to 15 years for other intangibles. Amortization methods, useful lives and residual values are reassessed annually. Research expenditures are recognized as an expense as incurred.\n\n## Property, plant and equipment (Note 11)\n\nProperty, plant and equipment are valued at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment charges. Costs include expenditures that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset, including borrowing cost of capital investment projects under construction.\n\nDepreciation is calculated using the straight-line method, based on the estimated useful life of the asset components. The useful life of plant equipment and machinery generally ranges from 10 to 25 years, and for buildings ranges from 20 to 50 years. Land is not depreciated. Other equipment contains assets with a useful life ranging from 3 to 20 years. In the majority of cases, residual value is assumed to be not significant. Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reassessed annually.\n\nCosts of major maintenance activities are capitalized and depreciated over the estimated useful life. Maintenance costs which cannot be separately defined as a component of property, plant and equipment are expensed in the period in which they occur. We recognize conditional asset retirement obligations in the periods in which sufficient information becomes available to reasonably estimate the cash outflow.\n\n## Leases (Note 12, 20)\n\nAs a lessee, we assess whether a contract is, or contains, a lease at inception. A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for a consideration.\n\nAt commencement, or on modification, of a contract that contains a lease component, we allocate the consideration in the contract to each lease component on the basis of its relative stand-alone price. However, for the leases of cars, we have elected not to separate non-lease components and account for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component.\n\nWe recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability at the lease commencement date. The right-of-use asset is initially measured at the present value of the lease liability. The right-of-use asset value contains lease prepayments, lease incentives received, the initial direct costs and an estimate of restoration, removal and dismantling costs.\n\nThe right-of-use assets are depreciated using the straight-line method from the commencement date to the end of the lease term or shorter economic life. In addition, the value of right-of-use assets is reduced by impairment losses, if any, and adjusted for certain remeasurements of the lease liability.\n\nThe net present value of the lease liability is measured at the discounted value of the lease payments. The liability includes payments to be made in optional periods if it is reasonably certain that we will exercise an option to extend the lease, or that we will not exercise an option to terminate the lease. The lease payments comprise the following:\n\n- \u00b7 Fixed payments (including in substance fixed payments), less any lease incentives\n- \u00b7 Variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate",

        "page_content": "## NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n- \u00b7 The exercise price of a purchase option if it is reasonably certain that the option will be exercised\n- \u00b7 Payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the lessee exercising an option to terminate the lease; and\n- \u00b7 Amounts expected to be payable under residual value guarantees\n\nThese lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease contract, if that rate can be readily determined. If that rate cannot be readily determined, the incremental borrowing rate is used. We determine our incremental borrowing rates by obtaining interest rates from various external financing sources and make certain adjustments to reflect the term of the lease and type of the asset leased. At the lease commencement dates, we assess whether it is reasonably certain that we will exercise the extension options. We reassess whether it is reasonably certain that we will exercise the options, if there is a significant event or significant change in circumstances within our control.\n\nAt the commencement date, we assess whether it is reasonably certain that:\n\n- \u00b7 An option to extend is exercised; or\n- \u00b7 An option to purchase is exercised; or\n- \u00b7 An option to terminate the lease is not exercised\n\nIn making these assessments, all relevant facts and circumstances that create an economic incentive for us to exercise, or not to exercise, the option, including any expected changes in facts and circumstances from the commencement date until the exercise date of the option, are considered.\n\n## Short-term leases and leases of low-value assets\n\nWe do not record right-of-use assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet for leases of low-value assets and short-term leases. We recognize the lease payments associated with these leases as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n\n## Impairments (Note 10, 11, 12)\n\nWe assess the carrying value of intangible assets, property, plant and equipment and rightof-use assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable as a result of e.g. changes in cash flow forecasts, damages, market developments or environmental and climate change risks. In addition, for goodwill and other intangible assets with an indefinite useful life, the carrying value is reviewed at least annually or when circumstances indicate the carrying amount may be impaired. If the carrying value of an asset or its cash-generating unit exceeds its estimated\n\nrecoverable amount, an impairment loss is recognized in the statement of income on the functional level of the asset impaired. The assessment for impairment is performed at the lowest level of assets generating largely independent cash inflows. For goodwill and other intangible assets with an indefinite life, we have determined this to be at business unit level (one level below operating segment).\n\nExcept for goodwill, we reverse impairment losses in the statement of income if and to the extent we have identified a change in estimates used to determine the recoverable amount.\n\n## Associates (Note 13)\n\nAssociates are accounted for using the equity method and are initially recognized at cost. The Consolidated financial statements include our share of the income and expenses of the associates, whereby the result is determined using our accounting principles. When the share of losses exceeds the interest in the investee, the carrying amount is reduced to nil and recognition of further losses is discontinued, unless we have further legal or constructive obligations.\n\n## Inventories (Note 15)\n\nInventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Costs of inventories comprise all costs of purchase, costs of conversion and other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to the present location and condition. The costs of inventories are determined using weighted average cost.\n\n## Provisions (Note 19)\n\nWe recognize provisions when a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event exists, it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits is required to settle the obligation and the amount can be reliably estimated. Provisions are measured at net present value. The increase of provisions as a result of the passage of time is recognized in the statement of income under financing income and expenses.\n\nProvisions for restructuring of activities are recognized when a detailed and formal restructuring plan has been approved, and the restructuring has either commenced or has been announced publicly. We do not provide for future operating costs.",

        "page_content": "## NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## Financial instruments\n\n## Classification\n\nAll assets are measured at amortized cost, fair value through profit or loss or fair value through other comprehensive income. Financial assets are classified according to a model based on:\n\n- \u00b7 A contractual cash flow characteristics test\n- \u00b7 A business model dictating how the reporting entity manages its financial assets in order to generate cash flows as either:\n- 1. Hold to collect contractual cash flows\n- 2. Collect contractual cash flows and sell\n- 3. Neither 1 or 2\n- \u00b7 Election of the fair value option in some specific cases in order to eliminate an accounting mismatch\n\nThe classification of a financial asset is determined at initial recognition, but if certain conditions are met, an asset might be subject to reclassification.\n\n## Valuation and impairment\n\nFinancial assets are assessed for impairment either according to the general approach or a simplified approach.\n\nThe calculation of impairment under the general approach uses the following stages:\n\n- \u00b7 12-month expected credit losses, taking into account possible default events within one year\n- \u00b7 Lifetime expected credit losses in case of an increase in credit risk, through recognition of expected credit losses over the remaining life of the exposure\n- \u00b7 Lifetime expected credit losses, where interest is calculated on the net amount of the receivables less impairment loss\n\nIn all above stages, the impairment calculation used is based on external credit ratings of involved parties or default rates published by well-known credit risk agencies.\n\nThe financial assets included in the general impairment approach are long-term loans and other long-term receivables.\n\nThe calculation of impairment under the simplified approach requires recognition of lifetime expected credit loss (no tracking of changes in credit risk). The financial assets included in the simplified impairment approach are trade receivables and the remaining financial assets.\n\n## Measurement\n\nRegular purchases and sales of financial assets and liabilities are recognized on trade date. The initial measurement of all financial instruments is at fair value. Except for derivatives and cash and cash equivalents, the initial measurement of financial instruments is adjusted for directly attributable transaction costs.\n\n## Derivative financial instruments (Note 26)\n\nDerivative financial instruments are recognized at fair value on the balance sheet. Fair values are derived from market prices and quotes from dealers and brokers or are estimated using observable market inputs. When determining fair values, credit risk for our contract party, as well as for AkzoNobel, is taken into account.\n\nChanges in fair value are recognized in the statement of income, unless cash flow hedge accounting or net investment hedge accounting is applied. In those cases, the effective part of the fair value changes is deferred in other comprehensive income and released to the related specific lines in the statement of income or balance sheet at the same time as the hedged item.\n\n## Financial non-current assets (Note 14) and Trade and other receivables (Note 16)\n\nLoans and receivables are measured at amortized cost, using the effective interest method, less any impairment losses. Positions are netted, if there is an intention to set off and when legally enforceable.\n\n## Cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments (Note 20)\n\nCash and cash equivalents and short-term investments are measured at fair value. Cash and cash equivalents include all cash balances and other investments that are directly convertible into known amounts of cash. Changes in fair values are included in financing income and expenses.\n\n## Long-term and Short-term borrowings (Note 20, 26) and Trade and other payables (Note 21)\n\nLong-term and short-term borrowings, as well as trade and other payables, are measured at amortized cost, using the effective interest rate method. The interest expense on borrowings is included in financing income and expenses. The fair value of borrowings, used for disclosure purposes, is determined based on listed market price, if available. If a listed market price is not available, the fair value is calculated based on the present value of principal and interest cash flows, discounted at the interest rate at the reporting date,",

Positions are netted, if there is an intention to set off and when legally enforceable.\n\n## New IFRS accounting standards\n\nIFRS standards and interpretations thereof not yet in force, which may apply to our Consolidated financial statements for 2024 and beyond, have been assessed for their potential impact.\n\nThese include, among others, amendments to IAS 1 \"Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current\" and \"Non-current Liabilities with Covenants\", amendments to IFRS 16 \"Lease Liability in Sale and Leaseback\", amendments to IAS 7 and IFRS 7 \"Supplier Finance Arrangements\", amendments to IAS 21 \"Lack of Exchangeability\" and amendments to IFRS 10 and IAS 28 \"Sale or Contribution of Assets between an Investor and its Associate or Joint Venture\". These changes are not expected to have a material effect on AkzoNobel's Consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Note 2: Scope of consolidation\n\n## Material subsidiaries\n\nThe Consolidated financial statements comprise the assets, liabilities, income and expenses of 238 legal entities. We consider legal entities material when they represent, for at least two subsequent years, more than 5% of either revenue or operating income. Material subsidiaries included in the table below are fully owned at year-end 2023, except for Akzo Nobel India Limited (74.76% owned by AkzoNobel). Refer to Note 17 Group equity for an overview of non-controlling interests.\n\n## Material subsidiaries related to continuing operations\n\n| Legal entity                         | Principal place of business   |\n|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------|\n| Akzo Nobel Coatings Inc.             | US                            |\n| Akzo Nobel Paints (Shanghai) Co Ltd. | China                         |\n| Akzo Nobel India Limited             | India                         |\n| Imperial Chemical Industries Limited | UK                            |\n| Akzo Nobel Decorative Coatings B.V.  | The Netherlands               |\n| Akzo Nobel Coatings SPA              | Italy                         |\n| Akzo Nobel Ltda                      | Brazil                        |\n\n## Acquisitions\n\nOn August 1, 2023, AkzoNobel acquired 100% of the shares of Valspar Coatings Holding Co. Ltd., Hong Kong (hereafter: \"the Huarun business\") for \u20ac72 million. The acquisition strengthens our position in China. It will allow us further market segmentation and reinforce our position outside of the premium segment.\n\nThe provisional purchase price allocation resulted in \u20ac32 million of goodwill (non-deductible for tax purposes), \u20ac28 million of other intangible assets (of which \u20ac13 million relates to brands which have finite useful lives) and \u20ac42 million other fixed and current assets, excluding deferred taxes. Revenue of the Huarun business over 2023 amounted to \u20ac66 million. Since its acquisition, the Huarun business contributed \u20ac32 million to AkzoNobel's consolidated revenues.\n\nThe goodwill is mainly attributable to synergies expected to be achieved from integrating the acquired business into the group. The purchase price allocation is provisional due to the limited time between the date of acquisition and the reporting date. The purchase price allocation will be finalized before August 1, 2024. No material changes from the current purchase price allocation are expected. The Huarun business has been integrated in business unit Decorative Paints China and North Asia.\n\nOn April 22, 2022, AkzoNobel acquired 100% of the shares of Colombia-based paints and coatings company Grupo Orbis S.A. (Grupo Orbis) for \u20ac566 million. The acquisition strengthens our position in Latin America.\n\nBased on the final purchase price allocation, the transaction resulted in \u20ac267 million of goodwill, non-deductible for tax purposes (2022: \u20ac262 million), \u20ac257 million of other intangible assets (2022: \u20ac259 million), \u20ac120 million of property, plant and equipment (2022: \u20ac121 million) and \u20ac199 million other fixed and current assets  (2022: \u20ac202 million).\n\nThe goodwill is mainly attributable to synergies expected to be achieved from integrating the company into the group. The paints business of Grupo Orbis has been integrated in business unit Decorative Paints Latin America. The coatings businesses have been integrated in the respective Performance Coatings business units in 2023. In 2022, these businesses were temporarily reported in business unit Performance Coatings Other.\n\nOn December 1, 2022, we acquired the wheel liquid coatings business of Lankwitzer Lackfabrik GmbH for \u20ac36 million in an asset deal. The final purchase price allocation resulted in \u20ac5 million of goodwill, deductible for tax purposes (2022: \u20ac7 million), \u20ac20 million of other intangible assets (2022: \u20ac17 million) and \u20ac13 million other fixed and current assets (2022: \u20ac14 million). The goodwill is mainly attributable to synergies expected to be achieved from integrating the acquired business into the group. This business has been integrated in business unit Powder Coatings.",

Please refer to Note 3 Segment information for more details on the property divestments.\n\n## Note 3: Segment information\n\nIn presenting and discussing segmental operating results AkzoNobel uses two operational segments, Decorative Paints and Performance Coatings. Items which are not allocated to\n\neither one of these segments, mainly comprise of corporate assets and corporate costs and are reported in 'Corporate and other'.\n\n## Decorative Paints\n\nWe provide decorative paints to both the professional and the do-it-yourself markets. We supply a variety of quality products for every situation and surface, including paints, lacquers and varnishes. We also offer a range of mixing machines and color concepts for the building and renovation industry.\n\nThe business units in the operating segment Decorative Paints are set up regionally, as the paints business is managed per region. Refer to Note 4 Revenue for a disaggregation of revenues per region.\n\n## Performance Coatings\n\nWe are a supplier of performance coatings that protect and enhance ships, cars, aircraft, yachts and architectural components (structural steel, building products, flooring), consumer goods (mobile devices, appliances, beverage cans, furniture) and oil and gas facilities. The business units in the operating segment Performance Coatings are set up per product/end market as the segment is managed based on product/end market combinations. Refer to Note 4 Revenue for a disaggregation of revenues per product/end market.\n\nDue to the integration of all resins activities in Latin America into the Industrial Coatings business unit, these activities have been reallocated from Decorative Paints to Performance Coatings. The 2022 comparative figures have been updated to allow proper comparison.\n\nThe tables in this Note include Alternative Performance Measures (APMs).

These Alternative Performance Measures should not be viewed in isolation as alternatives to the equivalent IFRS measures and should be used as supplementary information in conjunction with the most directly comparable IFRS measures. Alternative Performance Measures do not have a standardized meaning under IFRS and therefore may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. Where a non-financial measure is used to calculate an operational or statistical ratio, this is also considered an alternative performance measure.\n\nA reconciliation of the Alternative Performance Measures to the most directly comparable IFRS measures can be found in the tables on this page and the next pages.\n\n## Identified items\n\n## Restructuring related costs\n\nRestructuring related costs primarily relate to costs for accruals for certain employee benefits and for other costs which are directly associated with plans to exit or cease specific activities and closing down of facilities.\n\n## Property divestments\n\nProperty divestments in 2023 primarily relate to the gains on the divestment of the Offenbach site in Germany and the Bangkok site in Thailand.\n\n## Adjustments to interest\n\nAdjustments to interest in 2023 mainly related to the wind down of the cash flow hedges related to the previously anticipated acquisition of Kansai Paints Africa. Refer to Note 26 Financial risk management for more details.\n\nIn 2022, interest income of \u20ac10 million was recognized related to the UK ACT case. The UK ACT case is a group litigation case the company participates in ('Franked Investment Income litigation/case'; filed in 2003) in order to seek recovery of Advance Corporation Tax.\n\n## Adjustments to income tax\n\nIn 2023, adjustments to income tax amounted to a net tax charge of \u20ac13 million, which mainly related to the tax impact on the identified items in interest and operating income. In 2022 this tax impact on identified items in interest and operating income of \u20ac18 million was partly offset by a \u20ac13 million tax charge related to the UK ACT case.\n\n## Reconciliations of APMs to the nearest IFRS measures\n\n## Alternative Performance Measures\n\n|                                                                               | 2022                    | 2022                      | 2022   | 2022                    | 2022                      | 2023   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|---------------------------|--------|-------------------------|---------------------------|--------|\n| in \u20ac millions                                                                 | Continu- ing operations | Discon- tinued operations | Total  | Continu- ing operations | Discon- tinued operations | Total  |\n| Operating income                                                              | 708                     | -                         | 708    | 1,029                   | -                         | 1,029  |\n| APM adjustments to  operating income                                          |                         |                           |        |                         |                           |        |\n| Restructuring related costs                                                   | 80                      | -                         | 80     | 89                      | -                         | 89     |\n| Property divestments                                                          | -                       | -                         | -      | (63)                    | -                         | (63)   |\n| Acquisition related costs                                                     | 9                       | -                         | 9      | 15                      | -                         | 15     |\n| Other                                                                         | (8)                     | -                         | (8)    | 4                       | -                         | 4      |\n| Total APM adjustments  (Identified items) to  operating income                | 81                      | -                         | 81     | 45                      | -                         | 45     |\n| Adjusted operating income                                                     | 789                     | -                         | 789    | 1,074                   | -                         | 1,074  |\n| Profit for the period  attributable to shareholders  of the company           | 362                     | (10)                      | 352    | 447                     | (5)                       | 442    |\n| Adjustments to operating  income                                              | 81                      | -                         | 81     | 45                      | -                         | 45     |\n| Adjustments to interest                                                       | (10)                    | -                         | (10)   | 44                      | -                         | 44     |\n| Adjustments to income tax                                                     | (5)                     | -                         | (5)    | (13)                    | -                         | (13)   |\n| Total APM adjustments                                                         | 66                      | -                         | 66     | 76                      | -                         | 76     |\n| Adjusted profit for the  period attributable to  shareholders of the  company | 428                     | (10)                      | 418    | 523                     | (5)                       | 518    |",

In 2023, the number of employees remained stable at 35,200 people (year-end 2022: 35,200 people). Acquisitions in 2023 added around 200 people.\n\n## Share-based compensation\n\nShare-based compensation relates to the equity-settled performance-related share plan and the restricted share plans, as well as the share-matching plan. Charges recognized in the 2023 statement of income for share-based compensation amounted to \u20ac18 million and are included in salaries and wages (2022: \u20ac16 million).\n\n## Performance-related and restricted share plans\n\nUnder the performance-related share plan and the restricted share plans, a number of conditional shares are granted to the members of the Board of Management, members of the Executive Committee, executives and certain other employee categories each year. The number of participants of the performance-related share plan and the restricted share plans at year-end 2023 was 666 (2022: 616). The shares of the performance-related and restricted share plan series 2020-2022 have vested and were delivered to the participants in 2023.\n\nThe performance targets for the conditional grant of performance-related shares of the current plans for the Board of Management and the Executive Committee (series 2021-2023, 2022-2024 and 2023-2025) are linked to revenue growth (20%), adjusted EBITDA (40%), ROI ( 20%), and Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) KPIs (20%). A two-year holding restriction after vesting applies.\n\nThe plans for the executives and certain non-executive employee categories are restricted share plans without any performance conditions, whereby the conditional grant of shares will vest upon the condition that they remain in service with the company during the threeyear vesting period. A one-year holding restriction after vesting applies for the executives.\n\nThe conditional shares of the 2021-2023 performance share plan for the AkzoNobel participants vested for 12.30% (series 2020-2022: 0%), including dividend shares of 7.42% (series 2020-2022: 7.33%), the final vesting percentage amounted to 13.21% (series 2020-2022: 0%).\n\nThe share price of a common AkzoNobel share at year end 2023 amounted to \u20ac74.82 (2022: \u20ac62.56).",

Under certain conditions, members who invest part of their short-term incentive payment in AkzoNobel shares may have such shares matched by the company one-on-one. During 2023, no potential matching shares were matched as the members of the Board of Management and the members of the Executive Committee were not eligible for matching shares on the 2020 series. However, in 2023, the 2,708 potential matching shares that were granted to Thierry Vanlancker were pro-rated, resulting in 903 potential matching shares. These shares were matched upon termination of the management agreement in April 2023. In 2023, the members of the Board of Management and the members of the Executive Committee invested part of their 2022 short-term incentive in AkzoNobel shares, leading to 2,545 potential matching shares. The total number of matching shares outstanding per December 31, 2023, is 3,626. For an overview of the matching shares outstanding for the members of the Board of Management per December 31, 2023, we refer to the Remuneration report.\n\n## Fair value of matching shares\n\nThe fair value of the matching shares of \u20ac68.78 was based on the opening share price on the investment date of April 26, 2023, being \u20ac74.56, discounted for expected dividends over the holding period (dividend yield: 2.66%).",

Capitalized interest was negligible in both 2023 and 2022. The average interest rate on total debt was 3.2% (2022: 2.1%).\n\n## Impact hyperinflation accounting\n\nWe have applied IAS 29 \"Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies\" for T\u00fcrkiye as from January 1, 2022. For Argentina, hyperinflation accounting was already applied as from January 1, 2018. In addition, and in line with IAS 21 \"The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates\", end of period rates are used to translate both the balance sheet and the statement of income into euros.\n\nFor T\u00fcrkiye, the revaluation effect on the non-monetary assets at January 1, 2022, was \u20ac16 million positive (after taxes), recorded as a restatement to opening shareholders' equity. In addition, the opening balance of intangible assets has been restated by \u20ac1 million (refer to Note 10 Intangible assets) and the opening balance of property, plant and equipment has been restated by \u20ac15 million (refer to Note 11 Property, plant and equipment). Refer to Note 8 Income tax for the related opening balance impact on deferred taxes.\n\nThe impact of the application of hyperinflation accounting and the use of end of period rates to translate the statement of the income statement is shown in the table below.\n\n| Hyperinflation accounting in \u20ac millions              | 2022   | 2023   |\n|------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Revenue                                              | 5      | (64)   |\n| Operating income                                     | (46)   | (54)   |\n| Net interest on net debt                             | 0      | 17     |\n| Exchange rate results                                | 4      | 54     |\n| Hyperinflation: net gain/(loss) on monetary position | (20)   | (46)   |\n| Financing income and expenses                        | (16)   | 25     |\n| Profit before tax                                    | (62)   | (29)   |\n| Income tax                                           | (12)   | (48)   |\n| Profit for the period                                | (74)   | (77)   |\n| Attributable to                                      |        |        |\n| Shareholders of the company                          | (63)   | (65)   |\n| Non-controlling interests                            | (11)   | (12)   |\n\n## Note 8: Income tax\n\nPre-tax income from continuing operations for the year amounted to a profit of \u20ac784 million (2022: \u20ac602 million). The net tax charges related to continuing operations are included in the statement of income as shown in this Note and amount to \u20ac296 million (2022: \u20ac214 million), leading to an effective tax rate of 37.8% (2022: 35.5%).\n\n## Classification of current and deferred tax result\n\nA breakdown into current and deferred tax expenses and a split of the main categories is provided in the table below. For comparative reasons, this table presents the income tax expense excluding the impact from discontinued operations. The total deferred tax in the statement of income including discontinued operations was \u20ac9 million (2022: \u20ac8 million income).

Based on the Dutch tax system there is a limited credit for such taxes.\n\nThe derecognition of deferred tax assets in 2023 mainly relates to re-assessments of, among others, technical tax limitations to deduct interest.\n\nAdjustments for prior years in 2023 mainly related to true-ups as a result of tax audits, while in 2022 in addition also a net tax charge of \u20ac13 million for the UK ACT case was recorded (refer to Note 3 Segment information for more details).\n\nThe net effect of hyperinflation accounting in Argentina and T\u00fcrkiye combined in 2023 is 3.2% (2022: 2.8%). This mainly relates to the restatement of reserves, which results in a non-taxable, non-cash impact on the effective tax rate.\n\n## Origination of deferred tax assets and liabilities\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities originate from temporary differences in various balance sheet line items, as well as from tax credits and tax loss carryforwards.

The ultimate realization of the deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income against which the deductible temporary differences, unused tax losses and unused tax credits can be utilized.\n\nManagement considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. The projections used to assess recoverability are, in general, based on a projection of 10 years. Specific facts and circumstances per country may lead to shorter or longer projection periods being used. Growth in profitability is projected using GDP growth, adjusting for specific factors affecting profitability of our operations within the country.\n\nThe amount of deferred tax assets considered realizable could change if future estimates of projected taxable income during the carryforward period, or other variables, are revised. The majority of the amount of the non-current portion of deferred and current taxes will be recovered or settled after more than 12 months.\n\nIn 2023, the assessment of deferred tax asset recoverability on the basis of taxable profit forecasts resulted in derecognition of deferred tax assets related to non-deductible interest carried forward. In 2022, the assessment of deferred tax asset recoverability on the basis of taxable profit forecasts did not result in a significant net derecognition or re-recognition.\n\nAt year-end 2023, approximately 70% (2022: approximately 75%) of the recognized deferred assets  concerned the UK, the Netherlands and Germany.\n\nFrom the total amount of recognized net deferred tax assets, \u20ac151 million (2022: \u20ac206 million) is related to entities that have suffered a loss in either the current or the previous year and where utilization is dependent on future taxable profit in excess of the profit arising from the reversal of existing taxable temporary differences. This assessment is based on management's long-term projections and tax planning strategies.\n\nIn 2023, deferred tax assets not recognized include \u20ac548 million of tax loss carryforwards and \u20ac44 million of non-deductible interest. In 2022, deferred tax assets not recognized fully related to tax loss carryforwards. The losses in the tables on tax losses carried forward on the next page are gross amounts, with the tax impact included in the last column of the table.\n\nA deferred tax liability is recognized for taxable temporary differences related to investments in subsidiaries, branches and associates and interests in joint arrangements, to the extent that it is probable that these will reverse in the foreseeable future. The expected net tax impact of the remaining differences for which no deferred tax liabilities have been recognized is \u20ac47 million (2022: \u20ac55 million).",

Uncertain tax positions for which liabilities have been recorded, mainly relate to international transfer pricing and deductibility of expenses.\n\nIn certain cases, uncertain tax positions are related to disputes with tax authorities. Such disputes are usually strongly contested and defended by the company, often assisted by outside counsel and/or experts. Significant judgment is involved in the determination of such liabilities. Probability is assessed by applying interpretation of legislation and relevant case law.\n\n## Impact OECD Pillar Two framework\n\nOn December 15, 2022, the Council of the EU adopted the Pillar Two directive, which was subsequently embedded in Dutch law on December 19, 2023. This directive will introduce a minimum corporate tax rate set at 15% for each jurisdiction in which a company operates. For AkzoNobel, the new rules will be applicable as of 2024.\n\nIn the 2023 financial statements, AkzoNobel applied the exemption for recognizing and disclosing information about deferred tax assets and liabilities related to Pillar Two income taxes.\n\nAkzoNobel performed an analysis of the expected impact of the implementation of the directive for AkzoNobel Group based on historical data. Based on this analysis, the Transitional CbCR Safe Harbour is expected to be applicable for the majority of jurisdictions and hence effectively excludes those jurisdictions from the scope of the rules in the initial years. For the remaining jurisdictions, no material financial impact is anticipated for the foreseeable future. Due to complexities in applying the Pillar Two legislation as well as the fact that further guidance on rules and regulations is expected in the coming period, the company will continue to assess the impact of the Pillar Two legislation on its future performance.",

        "page_content": "## NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## Brands\n\nBrands as included in the table below comprise of brands with indefinite useful lives and brands with finite useful lives. Brands with indefinite useful lives are almost fully related to Dulux, which is the major brand, due to its global presence, high recognition and strategic nature. Other intangibles include licenses, know-how, intellectual property rights, software and development cost. Both at year-end 2023 and 2022, there were no material purchase commitments for individual intangible assets. No intangible assets were registered as security for bank loans.\n\n## Acquisitions through business combinations\n\nThe additions from acquisitions in 2023 primarily relate to the acquisition of the Huarun business, China. In 2022, additions from acquisitions primarily related to the acquisition of Grupo Orbis S.A., Colombia, and of the wheel liquid coatings business of Lankwitzer Lackfabrick GmbH, Germany. Refer to Note 2 Scope of consolidation for disclosures on acquisitions.\n\nThe paints business of Grupo Orbis has been allocated to business unit Decorative Paints Latin America in 2022. In 2022, the Grupo Orbis coatings businesses were reported in Performance Coatings Other. In 2023, these businesses have been included in the respective Performance Coatings business units.\n\n## Annual impairment testing\n\nGoodwill and other intangibles with indefinite useful lives are tested for impairment per business unit (one level below segment level) annually or whenever an impairment trigger exists, applying the value-in-use method.\n\nThe impairment test is based on the five-year plan, which contains euro-denominated cash flow projections for each of the business units. After the five-year plan period the terminal growth rate is applied, unless a different approach would be more appropriate. Elements considered to determine if a different approach would be more appropriate include high growth/emerging economies, geographic expansion opportunities, introduction of new product ranges and opportunities from market consolidation. In 2023, this exception was applied for Decorative Paints China and North Asia and for Decorative Paints South East and South Asia, for which the revenue growth and margin development projections were extrapolated beyond the five-year explicit forecast period for another five years, applying reduced average growth rates.\n\nMacro-economic developments and other relevant variables (e.g. inflation, geopolitical uncertainties, climate risks - refer to Note 1 Summary of material accounting policies for a description of the impact from climate change on the financial statements) are closely monitored to ensure that the impact on the estimated future cash flows is reflected in the models which are used to assess the value of AkzoNobel's asset base. The impact of climate change did not have a significant effect on the estimated future cash flows.\n\n## Goodwill and other intangibles per business unit\n\n|                                                  |       | Goodwill   | Brands with indefinite useful lives   | Brands with indefinite useful lives   |   Other intangibles with finite useful lives | Other intangibles with finite useful lives   | Total intangibles   | Total intangibles   |\n|--------------------------------------------------|-------|------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n| in \u20ac millions                                    | 2022  | 2023       | 2022                                  | 2023                                  |                                         2022 | 2023                                         | 2022                | 2023                |\n| Decorative Paints Europe, Middle East and Africa | 107   | 106        | 837                                   | 836                                   |                                          136 | 126                                          | 1,080               | 1,068               |\n| Decorative Paints Latin America                  | 138   | 179        | 102                                   | 90                                    |                                          142 | 193                                          | 382                 | 462                 |\n| Decorative Paints China and North Asia           | -     | 32         | 680                                   | 643                                   |                                            9 | 35                                           | 689                 | 710                 |\n| Decorative Paints South East and South Asia      | 8     | 7          | 221                                   | 208                                   |                                           12 | 10                                           | 241                 | 225                 |\n| Powder Coatings                                  | 152   | 155        | -                                     | -                                     |                                           19 | 34                                           | 171                 | 189                 |\n| Marine and Protective Coatings                   | 197   | 210        | -                                     | -                                     |                                           94 | 96                                           | 291                 | 306                 |\n| Automotive and Specialty Coatings                | 290   | 301        | -                                     | -                                     |                                          156 | 150                                          | 446                 | 451                 |\n| Industrial Coatings                              | 413   | 440        | -                                     | -                                     |                                          110 | 125                                          | 523                 | 565                 |\n| Performance Coatings Other                       | 72    | -          | -                                     | -                                     |                                           59 | -                                            | 131                 | -                   |\n| Corporate and other                              | -     | -          | -                                     | -                                     |                                          118 | 105                                          | 118                 | 105                 |\n| Total                                            | 1,377 | 1,430      | 1,840                                 | 1,777                                 |                                          855 | 874                                          | 4,072               | 4,081               |",

The estimated pre-tax cash flows have been discounted to their present value using a pre-tax weighted average cost of capital. Discount rates have been determined for each business unit and range from 10.7% to 15.3% (2022: 10.8% to 15.9%), with a weighted average of 11.5% (2022: 11.7%). Both the long-term inflation expectations and the discount rates are reflective of the inflation expectation in the eurozone.\n\nIn 2023 and 2022, no impairment charges were recognized in relation to the annual impairment test.\n\nIn addition to the annual impairment test, sensitivity tests were performed to assess the impact of changes in the key assumptions revenue growth (50% lower), margin development (1 percentage point lower) and weighted average cost of capital (1 percentage point higher).\n\nGiven the continued uncertainty in the macro-economic environment, additional sensitivity tests have been performed, like last year, in order to assess the impact of more severe adverse changes in key assumptions.\n\nBoth the regular sensitivity tests and the additional sensitivity tests show that the changes in key assumptions would not cause carrying amounts to exceed recoverable amounts for any of the business units, except for Decorative Paints China and North Asia, where the recently acquired Huarun business is included.\n\n## Impairment of specific intangible assets\n\nPeriodical evaluations are performed in order to ensure timely detection of triggers that might indicate impairment of specific assets. Whenever such triggers are noted, the related assets are assessed for impairment as appropriate. In 2023 and 2022, no significant impairment charges were recorded in relation to specific assets.",

        "page_content": "## NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## Note 18: Post-retirement benefit provisions\n\nPost-retirement benefit provisions relate to defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans, including healthcare or welfare plans. The largest defined benefit pension plans are the ICI Pension Fund (ICIPF) and the Akzo Nobel (CPS) Pension Scheme (CPS) in the UK which together account for 86% of defined benefit obligations (DBO) and 90% of plan assets. Other pension plans include among others the largely unfunded plans in Germany, the plans in the US and certain other smaller plans in the UK. The benefits of these pension plans are based primarily on years of service and employees' compensation. The funding policy for the plans is consistent with local requirements in the countries of establishment. We also provide certain healthcare and life insurance benefits to retired employees, mainly in the US and the Netherlands.\n\nValuations of the obligations under the plans are carried out regularly by independent qualified actuaries. We accrue for the expected costs of providing such post-retirement benefits during the service years of the employees. Governance of the benefit plans is the responsibility of the Executive Pensions Committee. This committee provides oversight of the costs and risks of the plans including oversight of the impact of the plans on the company in terms of cash flow, pension expenses and the balance sheet. The committee develops and maintains policies on benefit design, funding, asset allocation and assumption setting.\n\n## Pension plans\n\nAlmost all of the defined benefit plans have been closed to new members since the early to mid-2000s, although in many plans long-serving employees continue to accrue benefits. For plans in the US, benefit accrual is frozen and employees participate in defined contribution plans for future service. In countries where plans are closed, new employees are eligible to join a defined contribution arrangement. In countries in high growth markets, pension schemes currently are not material. Unless mandated by law, it is our policy that any new plans are established as defined contribution plans.\n\nThe most significant risks that we run in relation to defined benefit plans are investment returns falling short of expectations, low discount rates, inflation exceeding expectations, retirees living longer than expected and legislation changes. The assets and liabilities of each of the funded plans are held outside of the company in a trust or a foundation, which is governed by a board of fiduciaries or trustees, depending on the legal arrangements in the country concerned. The primary objective with regards to the investment of pension plan assets is to ensure that each individual plan has sufficient funds available to satisfy future benefit obligations in accordance with local legal and legislative requirements. For this purpose, we work closely with plan trustees or fiduciaries to develop investment strategies. Studies are carried out periodically to analyze and understand the trade-off between expected investment returns, volatility of outcomes and the impact on cash contributions.\n\nWe aim to strike a cautious balance between these factors in order to agree affordable contribution schedules with plan fiduciaries.\n\nPlan assets principally consist of insurance (annuity) policies, long-term interest-earning investments and (investment funds with holdings primarily in) quoted equity securities. Our largest plans use derivatives (such as index futures, currency forward contracts and swaps) to reduce volatility of underlying variables, for efficient portfolio management and to improve the liability matching characteristics of the assets. Limits have been set on the use of derivatives which are periodically subject to review for compliance with the pension fund's investment strategy.\n\nIn line with our proactive pension risk management strategy, we seek to reduce risk in our pension plans over time. We evaluate potential de-risking opportunities on an ongoing basis. Future de-risking transactions may have both cash flow and balance sheet impacts which may be substantial, as had some of the de-risking actions already taken. The cost of fully removing risk would exceed estimated funding deficits.\n\nBetween 2014 and 2023, ICIPF and a smaller UK plan, the ICI Specialty Chemicals Pension Fund (ISCPF), have invested in annuity buy-in contracts that aim to hedge all key risks related to their pensioner populations. CPS also invested in an annuity buy-in contract in November 2022 that aims to hedge all key risks related to 39% of their pensioner liabilities.\n\nIn April 2023, the Trustee of the ISCPF entered into a further annuity buy-in agreement with Pension Insurance Corporation plc. It covers, in aggregate, \u00a3148 million (\u20ac168 million) of pensioner liabilities (insurer valuation). The buy-in involved the purchase of a bulk annuity policy under which the insurer will pay to ISCPF amounts equivalent to the benefits payable to all remaining pensioner and deferred members. The pension liabilities remain with, and the matching annuity policies are held within, ISCPF. The accounting impact of the transaction is a lower valuation of the plan assets giving a reduction in other comprehensive income of \u00a345 million (\u20ac51 million).\n\nBy purchasing bulk annuities, the ICIPF, CPS and ISCPF Trustees have taken significant steps in actively de-risking liabilities and reducing the risk that AkzoNobel will be required to contribute additional cash in the future.\n\nCPS also has an insurance contract to hedge longevity risk in respect of a portion of its pensioners not impacted by the recent buy-in transaction.\n\nOn November 25, 2020, correspondence between the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the UK Statistics Authority (UKSA) was published regarding the future of the Retail Price Index (RPI) measurement of inflation. With effect from February 2030 onwards, increases in the RPI will be aligned with those under the Consumer Prices Index (CPI) with owner occupiers' housing costs (CPIH). Broadly this is expected to result in RPI inflation being 1%",

The inflation assumption continues to be calculated using a market breakeven inflation rate and the CPI inflation assumption, on which the benefits of some plans are based, is set with reference to RPI. Until 2030, the CPI inflation assumption is calculated as 1% below RPI and from 2030 onwards as 0.1% below RPI.\n\nThe Virgin Media Ltd versus NTL Pension Trustees decision, handed down by the UK High Court on June 16, 2023, has implications for the validity of trust deeds of amendment over the last 25 years. This decision is being appealed. Whether this decision could also have implications for AkzoNobel's defined benefit pension plans in the UK, is yet to be determined. We are not in a position to make a reliable estimate of the impact of this decision, if any, or of the impact of any related legal or governmental follow-up actions. Therefore, no changes were made to the defined benefit obligation at this stage.\n\nThe remaining pension plans primarily represent plans accounted for as defined contribution plans. This includes, among others, the Pension Fund APF in the Netherlands and the 401k Plan in the US.\n\nThe ITP2 plan in Sweden is financed through insurance with the Alecta insurance company and is classified as a multi-employer defined benefit plan. As AkzoNobel does not have access to sufficient information from Alecta to enable defined benefit accounting treatment, it is accounted for as a defined contribution plan. Contributions in 2023 were \u20ac1 million (2022: \u20ac2 million). Alecta's funding ratio is normally allowed to vary between 125% and 175%. The most recently quoted ratio at September 2023 stood at 178%.\n\nThe expenses of all plans accounted for as defined contribution plans in AkzoNobel totaled \u20ac90 million in 2023 (2022: \u20ac89 million).\n\n## DBO at funded and unfunded pension plans*\n\n| in \u20ac millions, at December 31   | 2022   | 2023   |\n|---------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Wholly or partly funded plans   | 9,229  | 9,137  |\n| Unfunded plans                  | 246    | 270    |\n| Total                           | 9,475  | 9,407  |\n\n## Other post-retirement benefit plans\n\nAkzoNobel provides certain healthcare and life insurance benefits to retired employees, mainly in the US and the Netherlands. The risks to which the US healthcare plans expose AkzoNobel include the risk of future increases in the cost of healthcare which would increase the cost of maintaining the plans. The benefit payments to retirees under the Dutch plan are frozen. Both plans expose AkzoNobel to the risk of a decline in discount rates, which increases the plan obligations, and longevity risk as the plans generally pay lifetime benefits.\n\n## Reconciliation to the balance sheet\n\nThe closing net balance sheet position of \u20ac549 million net asset (2022: \u20ac602 million net asset) includes the pension plans (\u20ac652 million net asset; 2022: \u20ac709 million net asset) and other post-retirement plans (\u20ac103 million liability; 2022: \u20ac107 million liability).",

Administrative expenses, especially for the UK pension funds, of \u20ac25 million are included in 2023 operating income (2022: \u20ac26 million). In addition, we directly incurred asset management expenses of \u20ac2 million (2022: \u20ac2 million), which have been included in other comprehensive income.\n\n## Interest costs\n\nInterest costs on the DBO for both pensions and other post-retirement benefits, together with the interest income on plan assets, comprise the financing income related to postretirement benefits of \u20ac33 million (2022: \u20ac18 million), refer to Note 7 Financing income and expenses.\n\n## Pension plans in asset position\n\nPension balances recorded under Financial non-current assets totaled \u20ac1,017 million (2022: \u20ac1,029 million). The \u20ac12 million decrease in 2023 is due to \u20ac87 million of net actuarial losses, partly offset by \u20ac15 million of of employer contributions, net income of \u20ac42 million and exchange rate translation gains of \u20ac18 million.\n\nPlan assets could be recognized in the Company's balance sheet under IFRIC 14 because economic benefits are available in the form of future refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan, either during the life of the plan or on the (final) settlement of the plan liabilities.\n\n## Plan assets\n\nThe equities and government bond debt assets have quoted prices in active markets, although most are held through funds comprised of such instruments which are not actively traded themselves. The UK buy-in annuity policies have a value that is equal to the DBO of the pensioners covered by the policies.\n\nThe total value of plan assets not quoted in active markets is \u20ac6,603 million (2022: \u20ac6,666 million), including the UK buy-in annuity policies totaling \u20ac6,123 million (2022: \u20ac6,078 million), investments in real estate totaling \u20ac258 million (2022: \u20ac343 million) and other investments in infrastructure and insurance policies.\n\nPlan assets did not directly include any of AkzoNobel's own transferable financial instruments, nor any property occupied by or assets used by the company.\n\n## Plan assets\n\n| in \u20ac millions, at December 31           | Total   |   2022 Percentage of  total | Total   |   2023 Percentage of  total |\n|-----------------------------------------|---------|-----------------------------|---------|-----------------------------|\n| Equities                                | 225     |                           2 | 192     |                           2 |\n| Debt - fixed interest government  bonds | 580     |                           6 | 562     |                           6 |\n| Debt - index-linked government bonds    | 1,230   |                          12 | 1,177   |                          12 |\n| Debt - corporate and other bonds        | 1,394   |                          13 | 1,503   |                          15 |\n| UK buy-in annuity policies              | 6,078   |                          60 | 6,123   |                          61 |\n| Cash and cash equivalents               | 166     |                           2 | 126     |                           1 |\n| Other                                   | 520     |                           5 | 383     |                           3 |\n| Total                                   | 10,193  |                         100 | 10,066  |                         100 |\n\n## Cash flows\n\nIn 2024, we expect to contribute \u20ac43 million (2023: \u20ac53 million) to our defined benefit pension plans.

This table illustrates the overall impact on DBO for the changes shown, which management assessed could be reasonably possible over a longer term from a sensitivity test perspective. It should be noted, however, that this analysis does not indicate and probability of such changes occurring, not does it preclude larger changes in any given period or longer term.",

In particular, the plans differ in benefit design, currency and average term, meaning that different assumptions have different levels of significance for each plan.\n\nThe sensitivity analysis is intended to illustrate the inherent uncertainty in the valuation of the DBO under market conditions at the measurement date. Its results, in principle, cannot be extrapolated due to increasing non-linear effects that changes in the key actuarial assumptions, when deviating further from the assumptions presented, may have on the total DBO. Any management actions that may be taken to mitigate the inherent risks in the post-retirement defined benefit plans are not reflected in this analysis, as they would normally be reflected in plan asset changes rather than DBO changes.\n\nThe sensitivities in the table only apply to the DBO and not to the net amounts recognized in the balance sheet. Movements in the fair value of plan assets (which include the derisking instruments) would, to a significant extent, be expected to offset movements in the DBO resulting from changes in the given assumptions.\n\nAt ICIPF, the annuity buy-in contracts cover 99% of pensioner liabilities (2022: 99%) and 88% of total liabilities (2022: 88%).\n\nAt CPS, the annuity buy-in contract covers 39% of pensioner liabilities (2022: 42%) and 28% of total liabilities (2022: 28%). Also at CPS, the longevity hedge contract covers 45% of pensioner liabilities (2022: 48%) and 33% of total liabilities (2022: 30%).\n\n## Sensitivity of DBO to change in assumptions\n\n| in \u20ac millions                                  | ICIPF UK   | CPS UK   | Other pension plans   | Other post- retirement benefits   | Total   |\n|------------------------------------------------|------------|----------|-----------------------|-----------------------------------|---------|\n| Discount rate: 0.5% decrease                   | 260        | 140      | 74                    | 4                                 | 478     |\n| Price inflation: 0.5% increase*                | 152        | 85       | 39                    | -                                 | 276     |\n| Life expectancy: one year increase from age 60 | 362        | 94       | 42                    | 4                                 | 502     |\n| Maturity information                           |            |          |                       |                                   |         |\n| Weighted average duration of DBO (years)       | 8.9        | 11.8     | 11.3                  | 8.7                               | 10.0    |\n\n- * The sensitivity to price inflation assumption includes corresponding changes to all inflation-related compensation increases, pensions in payment and pensions in deferment.\n\n## Future benefit payments\n\nThe figures in the table below are the estimated future benefit payments to be paid from the plans to beneficiaries over the next ten years.\n\n## Future benefit payments\n\n| in \u20ac millions   | Pensions   |   Other post- retirement benefits |\n|-----------------|------------|-----------------------------------|\n| 2024            | 786        |                                10 |\n| 2025            | 792        |                                10 |\n| 2026            | 797        |                                10 |\n| 2027            | 806        |                                 9 |\n| 2028            | 809        |                                 9 |\n| 2029-2033       | 4,157      |                                39 |",

It should be understood that, in light of possible future developments, such as: (a) potential additional lawsuits; (b) possible future settlements; and (c) rulings or judgments in pending lawsuits, certain cases may result in additional liabilities and related costs. At this point in time, we cannot estimate any additional amount of loss or range of loss in excess of the recorded amounts with sufficient certainty to allow such amount or range of amounts to be meaningful. While the outcome of said cases, claims and disputes cannot be predicted with certainty, we believe, based upon legal advice and information received, that the final outcome will not materially affect our consolidated financial position but could be material to our results of operations or cash flows in any one accounting period.\n\n## Movements in other provisions\n\n| in \u20ac millions                     | Restructuring  of activities   | Environmental  costs   | Liabilities  to (former)   employees   | Sundry   | Total   |\n|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------|------------------------|----------------------------------------|----------|---------|\n| Balance at January 1, 2023        | 42                             | 51                     | 107                                    | 93       | 293     |\n| Additions made during the year    | 55                             | 11                     | 28                                     | 48       | 142     |\n| Utilization                       | (55)                           | (18)                   | (21)                                   | (48)     | (142)   |\n| Amounts reversed during the year  | (6)                            | -                      | -                                      | (9)      | (15)    |\n| Unwind of discount                | -                              | (2)                    | 3                                      | -        | 1       |\n| Acquisitions                      | -                              | 1                      | -                                      | 1        | 2       |\n| Changes in exchange rates         | -                              | (1)                    | -                                      | -        | (1)     |\n| Balance at December 31, 2023      | 36                             | 42                     | 117                                    | 85       | 280     |\n| Non-current portion of provisions | 1                              | 30                     | 88                                     | 42       | 161     |\n| Current portion of provisions     | 35                             | 12                     | 29                                     | 43       | 119     |\n| Balance at December 31, 2023      | 36                             | 42                     | 117                                    | 85       | 280     |\n\n## Provisions for restructuring of activities\n\nProvisions for restructuring of activities comprise of accruals for certain employee benefits and for costs which are directly associated with plans to exit or cease specific activities and closing down of facilities. For all restructuring provisions, a detailed formal plan exists and the implementation of the plan has started or the plan has been announced before the balance sheet date. Most restructuring plans are expected to be completed within one year from the balance sheet date.\n\n## Environmental liabilities\n\nWe are confronted with costs arising out of environmental laws and regulations, which include obligations to eliminate or limit the effects on the environment of the disposal or release of certain wastes or substances at various sites. Proceedings involving environmental matters, such as the alleged discharge of chemicals or waste materials into the air, water, or soil, are pending against us in various countries. In some cases, this concerns sites divested in prior years or derelict sites belonging to companies acquired in the past. The majority of the cash outflows relating to the environmental liabilities is expected to be within one to five years, whilst some one-third is projected to be spent after ten years. The provision has been discounted using an average pre-tax discount rate of 3.7% (2022: 3.8%).\n\nEstimating the impact of environmental liabilities often is complex and requires significant judgement. It requires the assessment of many (often interconnected) elements, which contain varying levels of uncertainty. Environmental liabilities can change substantially, among others due to the emergence of additional information on the nature or extent of the contamination, the geological circumstances, changes in (the interpretation and enforcement of) environmental regulations, new and evolving analytical and remediation techniques, success or lack of success of currently anticipated clean-up methods, actions by governmental agencies or private parties, success in allocating liability to other potentially responsible parties, the financial viability of other potentially responsible parties and third-party indemnitors, and/or other factors.\n\nEspecially for some sites for which we are faced with relatively new legislation, which are in the early stages of discussions with regulators, and/or where there is limited information available from earlier experience, there may be considerable variability between the cleanup activities that are currently being undertaken or planned and the ultimate actions that could be required. For such sites, the costs for the earlier years might be rather reliably estimable, whilst for later years it is much more difficult, if possible at all, to estimate the cost of environmental compliance and remediation. If the level of uncertainty is such that no reliable estimate can be made for the longer-term costs, no provision for such costs is recorded. While it is not feasible to predict the outcome of all pending environmental exposures, it is reasonably possible that there will be a need for future (changes to) provisions for environmental costs which, in management's opinion, based on information",

The majority of the cash outflows related to liabilities to (former) employees is expected to be after five years. In calculating the liabilities to (former) employees, a pre-tax discount rate of on average 4.3% (2022: 5.0%) has been used.\n\n## Sundry provisions\n\nSundry provisions relate to a variety of provisions, including provisions for (customer) claims, sales returns, guarantees and other operational provisions. The majority of the cash outflows related to sundry provisions is expected to be within one to five years. In calculating the sundry provisions, a pre-tax discount rate of on average 3.7% (2022: 5.3%) has been used.\n\n## Contingent liabilities\n\nA number of claims against AkzoNobel are pending, many of which are contested. This includes those where Akzo Nobel N.V. and two of its subsidiaries are currently defending claims brought by INPEX Operations Australia Pty Ltd and JKC Australia LNG Pty Ltd relating to the Ichthys Onshore Project in Darwin, Western Australia. A trial has been listed in the Federal Court of Australia, commencing June 17, 2024. The claims are contested and AkzoNobel denies liability in respect of both of these claims.\n\nWe are also involved in legal disputes and disputes with tax authorities in several jurisdictions. Those disputes include situations in which AkzoNobel has provided various indemnities and guarantees in respect of past divestments to the relevant purchasers and their permitted assigns (if applicable), which in general are capped in time and/or amount (in proportion to the value received). The provided guarantees and indemnities have varying maturity periods. AkzoNobel has received various claims under such indemnities and guarantees. In some instances, AkzoNobel has been named as a direct defendant despite the divestments.\n\nAkzo Nobel N.V. has withdrawn its declarations of joint and several liability under Article 403 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code for certain Dutch former Specialty Chemicals subsidiaries divested as per October 1, 2018, and is following the procedures to terminate its residual liability under those declarations under Article 404 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code. One objection against the termination of residual liability is still pending and AkzoNobel, Nouryon and Nobian continue to cooperate to get this resolved.\n\n## Current portion of provisions\n\nThe current portion of post-retirement benefit provisions (\u20ac45 million) and the current portion of other provisions (\u20ac119 million) add up to \u20ac164 million (2022: \u20ac166 million), as reflected in the balance sheet.\n\n## Discount rates\n\nThe discount rates used in calculating the provisions recognized at December 31, 2023, are mentioned in the paragraphs on provisions for environmental costs, liabilities to (former) employees and sundry provisions. Changes in discount rates will affect our consolidated financial position. A sensitivity test showed that a one percentage point increase or decrease of discount rates will have an impact down or up, respectively, of \u20ac6 million on the provisions recognized at December 31, 2023.",

This facility does not contain financial covenants or acceleration provisions that are based on adverse changes in ratings or material adverse change. At year-end 2023 and 2022, this facility has not been drawn.\n\n## Long-term borrowings\n\nAt year-end 2023, bonds issued amounted to \u20ac2,933 million (2022: \u20ac2,934 million); a specification is included in the table below.\n\n| Bonds issued in \u20ac millions, at December 31   | 2022   | 2023   |\n|----------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| 1 3/4% 2014/24 (\u20ac500 million)                | 499    | -      |\n| 1 1/8% 2016/26 (\u20ac500 million)                | 498    | 499    |\n| 1 1/2% 2022/28 (\u20ac600 million)                | 597    | 598    |\n| 1 5/8% 2020/30 (\u20ac750 million)                | 745    | 745    |\n| 2% 2022/32 (\u20ac600 million)                    | 595    | 595    |\n| 4% 2023/33 (\u20ac500 million)                    | -      | 496    |\n| Total                                        | 2,934  | 2,933  |\n\nIn May 2023, a bond was issued with a nominal value of \u20ac500 million, with a coupon of 4%, maturing in 2033.\n\nFor details on the exposure to interest rate and foreign currency risk, refer to Note 26 Financial risk management.\n\nThe average effective interest rate of the bonds included in long-term borrowings at yearend 2023 was 2.0% (year-end 2022: 1.6%).\n\n## Aggregated maturities of long-term borrowings\n\n| in \u20ac millions              | 2025-2028   | After 2028   |\n|----------------------------|-------------|--------------|\n| Bonds issued               | 1,097       | 1,836        |\n| Lease liabilities          | 158         | 36           |\n| Other long-term borrowings | 15          | 23           |\n| Total                      | 1,270       | 1,895        |\n\nThe blended incremental borrowing rate applied to the lease liabilities at year-end 2023 was 2.4% (2022: 1.9%).\n\nAt year-end 2023 and 2022, none of the borrowings was secured by collateral.\n\n## Short-term borrowings\n\nThe current portion of long-term borrowings increased mainly due to maturing of a \u20ac500 million bond and other loans in 2024.\n\nAt year-end 2023, our debt to credit institutions amounted to \u20ac1,635 million (2022: \u20ac2,450 million). Debt to credit institutions includes our commercial paper program and short-term bank loans. We have US dollar and euro commercial paper programs in place, which can be used to the extent that the equivalent portion of the \u20ac1.3 billion multi-currency revolving credit facility is not used. We had \u20ac0.8 billion commercial paper outstanding at year-end 2023 (2022: \u20ac1.3 billion) against an average interest rate of 4.1% (2022: 1.6%). At year-end 2023, we had short-term bank loans outstanding of \u20ac0.8 billion (2022: \u20ac1.1 billion) against a 3-months Euribor plus a mark-up (2022: 3-months Euribor plus a mark-up). None of these facilities contain financial covenants.\n\n## Short-term investments\n\nAt year-end 2023, we had short-term investments outstanding for an amount of \u20ac265 million (2022: \u20ac336 million). Short-term investments almost entirely consist of time deposits, money market funds and other marketable securities with a life time at investment date longer than three months but shorter than twelve months.

Mainly as a result of these restrictions, at December 31, 2023, an amount of \u20ac57 million in cash and cash equivalents (2022: \u20ac11 million) and \u20ac3 million in short-term investments (2022: \u20acnil) was restricted. The vast majority of these funds are available for use in the relevant subsidiaries' day-to-day business.",

Such transactions were conducted at terms comparable with transactions with third parties.\n\nDuring 2023, we considered the members of the Executive Committee and the Supervisory Board to be the key management personnel as defined in IAS 24 'Related parties'. For details on their remuneration, as well as on shares held by members of the Supervisory Board or Board of Management, refer to Note 25 Remuneration of the Supervisory Board and the Board of Management. In the ordinary course of business, we also have transactions with various organizations with which certain members of the Supervisory Board or Executive Committee are associated.\n\nFor related party transactions with pension funds, refer to Note 14 Financial non-current assets and Note 18 Post-retirement benefit provisions.\n\n## Note 25: Remuneration of the Supervisory Board and the Board of Management\n\nTotal compensation for key management personnel expensed during the period amounted to \u20ac19.2 million (2022: \u20ac13.2 million). An amount of \u20ac11.6 million relates to short-term employee benefits (2022: \u20ac7.4 million); \u20ac1.0 million relates to post contract benefits and other post contract compensation (2022: \u20ac0.8 million); \u20ac5.4 million relates to share-based compensation (2022: \u20ac3.0 million); no payments relate to other long-term incentives (2022: \u20acnil); \u20ac1.2 million payments relate to payments upon termination of employment (2022: \u20ac2.0 million). In 2023, no charges were accrued which relate to taxation on excessive pay ('Belasting heffing excessieve beloningsbestanddelen') (2022: \u20ac1.0 million).\n\nThis compensation includes total remuneration for the members of the Supervisory Board of \u20ac0.9 million (2022: \u20ac0.9 million) and for the members of the Board of Management of \u20ac7.7 million (2022: \u20ac6.9 million).

These risks are inherent to the way we operate as a multinational with a large number of locally operating subsidiaries. Our overall risk management program seeks to identify, assess, and - if necessary and possible - mitigate these financial risks in order to minimize potential adverse effects on our financial performance.\n\nOur risk mitigating activities include the use of derivative financial instruments to hedge certain risk exposures. The Board of Management is ultimately responsible for risk management. We centrally identify, evaluate and hedge financial risks, and monitor compliance with the corporate policies approved by the Board of Management, except for commodity risks, which are subject to identification, evaluation, hedging and monitoring in the businesses. Next to our centralized Treasury organization in Amsterdam, we have treasury hubs located in Brazil and China that are primarily responsible for regional cash management and short-term financing. We do not allow extensive treasury operations directly with external parties at subsidiary level.\n\n## Liquidity risk management\n\nThe primary objective of liquidity management is to provide for sufficient cash and cash equivalents at all times and any place in the world to enable us to meet our payment obligations. We aim for a well-spread maturity schedule of our long-term borrowings and a strong liquidity position. At year-end 2023, we had \u20ac1.5 billion available as cash and cash equivalents (2022: \u20ac1.2 billion) and \u20ac265 million available as short-term investments (2022: \u20ac58 million), refer to Note 20 Net debt.\n\nIn addition, we have a multi-currency revolving credit facility of \u20ac1.3 billion which runs until 2027. This facility does not contain financial covenants or acceleration provisions that are based on adverse changes in ratings or on other material adverse changes. At year-end 2023 and 2022, this facility had not been drawn. We have US dollar and euro commercial paper programs in place, which can be used to the extent that the equivalent portion of the \u20ac1.3 billion multi-currency revolving credit facility is not used. We had \u20ac0.8 billion commercial paper outstanding at year end 2023 (2022: \u20ac1.3 billion) against an average",

None of these facilities contain financial covenants. The table on maturity of liabilities and cash outflows in this Note shows our cash outflows per maturity group. The amounts disclosed in the table are the contractual undiscounted cash flows.\n\n## Credit risk management\n\nCredit risk arises from financial assets such as cash and cash equivalents, deposits with financial institutions, money market funds, trade receivables and derivative financial instruments with a positive fair value. We have a credit risk management policy in place to limit credit losses due to non-performance of financial counterparties and customers. We monitor our exposure to credit risk on an ongoing basis at various levels. We only deal with financial counterparties that have a sufficiently high credit rating. Generally, we do not\n\nrequire collateral in respect of financial assets. Investments in cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and transactions involving derivative financial instruments are entered into with counterparties that have sound credit ratings and a good reputation. Derivative transactions are concluded mostly with parties with whom we have contractual netting agreements and ISDA agreements in place. We set limits per counterparty for the different types of financial instruments we use. We closely monitor the acceptable financial counterparty credit ratings and credit limits and revise where required in line with the market circumstances. We do not expect non-performance by the counterparties for these financial instruments. Due to our geographical spread and the diversity of our customers, we were not subject to any significant concentration of credit risks at balance sheet date.\n\nThe credit risk from trade receivables is measured and analyzed by dedicated teams in the businesses, mainly by means of ageing analysis, refer to Note 16 Trade and other receivables. Additionally, trade receivables and financial assets measured at amortized cost are subject to the expected credit loss impairment model either using the general or the simplified approach. For more information on the applied impairment approaches per financial asset type, refer to Note 1 Summary of material accounting policies.\n\nThe maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying value of financial assets in the balance sheet.\n\nAt year-end 2023, the credit risk on consolidated level was \u20ac4.6 billion (2022: \u20ac4.6 billion) for cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, loans and trade and other receivables. Our credit risk is well spread among both global and local counterparties. Our largest counterparty risk amounted to \u20ac332 million at year-end 2023 (2022: \u20ac280 million).\n\n## Foreign exchange risk management\n\n## Trade and financing transactions\n\nWe operate in a large number of countries, where we have clients and suppliers, many of whom are outside of the local functional currency environment. This creates currency exposures which are partly netted out on group level. The purpose of our foreign currency hedging activities is to protect us from the risk that the functional currency net cash flows resulting from trade or financing transactions are adversely affected by changes in exchange rates. Our policy is to hedge our transactional foreign exchange rate exposures above predefined thresholds from recognized assets and liabilities. Hedge accounting is generally not applied for foreign currency hedging activities, except for certain specific forecasted transactions.\n\nAs from July 2022, cash flow hedge accounting was applied on a $450 million hedge for foreign currency risk exposure related to the intended acquisition of Kansai Paint's African",

Related to this hedge, a total loss of \u20ac36 million was recorded in the year in the statement of income under financing expenses, which included a loss of \u20ac46 million related to the recycling of the amount accumulated in the cash flow hedge reserve through other comprehensive income.\n\nIn general, our forward exchange contracts have a maturity of less than one year. When necessary, forward exchange contracts are rolled over at maturity. Currency derivatives are not used for speculative purposes.\n\n## Hedged notional amounts at year-end 1\n\n| in \u20ac millions   | Buy  2022   | Sell  2022   | Buy 2023   | Sell 2023   |\n|-----------------|-------------|--------------|------------|-------------|\n| US dollar       | 784         | 692          | 270        | 658         |\n| Pound sterling  | 649         | 10           | 794        | -           |\n| Chinese yuan    | 110         | 157          | 46         | 58          |\n| Brazilian real  | 30          | 64           | 19         | 57          |\n| Thai baht       | -           | 117          | 12         | 114         |\n| Other 2         | 248         | 641          | 230        | 543         |\n| Total           | 1,821       | 1,681        | 1,371      | 1,430       |\n\n- 1 No hedge accounting applied on these hedged notional amounts in 2023.\n- 2 No individually significant position is included in 'Other', the amounts per currency are highly disaggregated.\n\n## Investments in foreign subsidiaries and associates\n\nDuring 2023 and 2022, net investment hedge accounting was applied on hedges of certain net investments in foreign operations, which were partly hedged. The main net investments included were related to Chinese yuan, Brazilian real, Vietnamese dong and Indian rupee (2022: Brazilian real, Chinese yuan, Indonesian rupiah and Indian rupee), which were hedged with forward exchange contracts for the same currencies. The spot results related to these hedges were recognized in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the cumulative translation reserves. In addition, a net investment in Colombian peso was hedged with a COP 330 billion bank loan. The spot result related to this hedge was recognized in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the cumulative translation reserves. At year-end 2023, the hedge of the net investment in Colombian peso was outstanding. During 2023 and 2022, the hedges of net investments were fully effective.\n\n## Interest rate risk management\n\nWe are partly financed with debt in order to obtain more efficient leverage. Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate\n\nbecause of changes in market interest rates. Fixed rate debt results in fair value interest rate risk. Floating rate debt results in cash flow interest rate risk. At the end of 2023, 62% of our total debt consisted of fixed rate bonds (2022: 50%), 14% consisted of commercial paper (2022: 22%) and 15% of short-term loans (2022: 19%). The fixed/floating ratio of our outstanding bonds was 100% fixed (2022: 100% fixed). The weighted average maturity of our outstanding bonds at year-end is 5.4 years (2022: 5.7 years). The remainder of our total debt consisted of leases and other debt. For more information about our debt, refer to Note 20 Net debt. During 2023 and 2022, we have not used any interest rate derivatives.\n\n## Capital risk management\n\nOur objectives when managing capital are to safeguard our ability to satisfy our capital providers and to maintain a capital structure that optimizes our cost of capital. For this we maintain an adequate financial strategy, with the objective to retain a strong investment grade credit rating as assigned by the rating agencies Moody's and Standard & Poor's. The capital structure can be altered, among others, by adjusting the amounts of dividends paid to shareholders, return of capital to capital providers, or issuance of new debt or shares. In May 2023, a bond was issued with a nominal value of \u20ac500 million, with a coupon of 4%, maturing in 2033.\n\nConsistent with other companies in the industry, we monitor capital headroom based on the leverage ratio net debt/EBITDA for which we have set a target range of around 2. The ratio was 2.7 at December 31, 2023 (December 31, 2022: 3.8). EBITDA amounted to \u20ac1,386 million for 2023 (2022: \u20ac1,076 million). Net debt amounted to \u20ac3,785 million at year end 2023 (year end 2022: \u20ac4,089 million).\n\n## Fair value of financial instruments and IFRS 9 categories\n\nIn the table 'Fair value per financial instrument category' on the next page insight is provided in the recognition of the respective financial instruments per IFRS 9 category. The total carrying value is based on the accounting principles as outlined in Note 1 Summary of material accounting policies. Financial instruments are recognized at fair value and subsequently recognized either at fair value or at amortized cost, using the effective interest method. The financial instruments accounted for at fair value through profit or loss are derivative financial instruments and securities included in financial non-current assets and other current liabilities, cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments. The remaining financial instruments are accounted for at amortized cost.",

In general, under such agreements the amounts owed by each counterparty on a single day in respect of transactions outstanding in the same currency may be aggregated into a single net amount that is payable by one party to the other. In certain circumstances - e.g. when a credit event such as a default occurs - all outstanding transactions under the agreement may be terminated, the termination value is assessed and a net amount is payable in settlement of the transactions. We have evaluated the potential effect of netting agreements, including the effect of rights of set-off and concluded the impact is immaterial. We did not offset any amounts regarding derivative transactions.\n\n## Note 27: Subsequent events\n\nNo significant subsequent events have been identified.",

        "page_content": "## NOTES TO THE COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## Note A: General information\n\nAkzo Nobel N.V. is a company headquartered in the Netherlands. The address of our registered office is Christian Neefestraat 2, Amsterdam; the Chamber of Commerce number is 09007809.\n\nThe financial statements of Akzo Nobel N.V. have been prepared in accordance with Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code, making use of the option of Article 362 of the Code, meaning that the accounting principles used are the same as for the Consolidated financial statements. Foreign currency amounts have been translated, assets and liabilities have been valued, and net income has been determined in accordance with the principles of valuation and determination of income presented in Note 1 of the Consolidated financial statements.\n\nFor the Company financial statements, 2022 revenue relates to revenue generated through service contracts with third parties.\n\nConsolidated subsidiaries are all entities (including intermediate subsidiaries) over which the company has control. The company controls an entity when it is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the subsidiary and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the subsidiary. Subsidiaries are recognized from the date on which control is transferred to the company or its intermediate holding entities. They are derecognized from the date that control ceases.\n\nThe company applies the acquisition method to account for acquiring subsidiaries. The consideration transferred for the acquisition of a subsidiary is the fair value of assets transferred by the company, liabilities incurred to the former owners of the acquiree and the equity interests issued by the company. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in an acquisition are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date, and are subsumed in the net asset value of the investment in consolidated subsidiaries. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred.\n\nInvestments in consolidated subsidiaries are measured using the equity method, based on the measurement of assets, provisions and liabilities and determination of profit based on the principles applied in the consolidated financial statements. When an acquisition of an investment in a consolidated subsidiary is achieved in stages, any previously held equity interest is remeasured to fair value on the date of acquisition. The remeasurement against the book value is accounted for in the statement of income. When the company ceases to have control over a subsidiary, any retained interest is remeasured to its fair value, with the change in carrying amount to be accounted for in the statement of income.\n\nWhen parts of investments in consolidated subsidiaries are bought or sold, and such transaction does not result in the loss of control, the difference between the consideration paid or received and the carrying amount of the net assets acquired or sold, is directly recognized in equity.\n\nThe remuneration paragraph is included in Note 25 of the Consolidated financial statements. The number of employees having a contract with the Company at year-end 2023 was 5 (2022: 7). All employees are based in the Netherlands.\n\n## Note B: Financing income and expenses\n\nFinancing income and expenses are specified in the table below.\n\n## Financing income and expenses\n\n| in \u20ac millions                           | 2022   | 2023   |\n|-----------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Financing income - third parties        | 5      | 27     |\n| Financing income - subsidiaries         | 53     | 62     |\n| Financing expense - third parties       | (75)   | (145)  |\n| Financing expense - subsidiaries        | (39)   | (144)  |\n| Net interest on net debt                | (56)   | (200)  |\n| Other items                             | (15)   | 1      |\n| Net other financing income / (expenses) | (15)   | 1      |\n| Total                                   | (71)   | (199)  |\n\nOther items in 2023 and 2022 mainly include foreign currency results.",

The fair value of the loans to subsidiaries approximates the book value.\n\nFollowing an assessment in 2023, loans to subsidiaries, receivables from subsidiaries, and the long- and short-term portion of debt to subsidiaries were presented to reflect the contractual arrangements rather than the expected settlement dates. Therefore the balances for 2022 were similarly re-presented.\n\nLoans to subsidiaries that will mature between 2 and 5 years  amounted to \u20ac616 million (2022: \u20ac1,552 million). An amount of \u20ac19 million will mature after 5 years (2022: \u20ac84 million).\n\nOther non-current assets include the subordinated loan granted to the Pension Fund APF in the Netherlands valued at \u20ac90 million (2022: \u20ac89 million). Using a level 3 fair valuation method (discounted cash flow), a fair value of \u20ac98 million (2022: \u20ac93 million) was determined for this loan. For information on valuation methods, see Note 26 Financial risk management of the Consolidated financial statements.\n\nOther non-current assets further contain \u20ac39 million deferred tax assets (2022: \u20ac51 million). Akzo Nobel N.V. is head of the Dutch fiscal unity for corporate income tax. Members of the fiscal unity reflect taxes in their accounts as if they are taxable on a standalone basis and are charged or credited accordingly by the company.\n\n## Note E: Short-term receivables\n\n## Short-term receivables\n\n| in \u20ac millions, at December 31   | 2022   | 2023   |\n|---------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Receivables from subsidiaries*  | 1,260  | 1,948  |\n| FX contracts                    | 18     | 14     |\n| Other receivables               | 3      | 20     |\n| Total                           | 1,281  | 1,982  |\n\n- * Re-presented 2022 subsidiary balances to reflect contractual arrangements rather than the expected settlement date. Refer to note D for more details.\n\nShort-term receivables are expected to be settled within one year. Receivables from subsidiaries include interest to be received on intercompany loans of \u20ac19 million (2022: \u20ac17 million) and the current portion of a loan to a subsidiary maturing in 2024 with a value of \u20ac1.1 billion.

The holders of the priority shares are entitled to a dividend of 6% per share or the statutory interest in the Netherlands, whichever is lower, plus any accrued and unpaid dividends. They are entitled to 800 votes per share (in accordance with the 800 times higher nominal value per share) at the Annual General Meeting of shareholders. In addition, the holders of priority shares have the right to draw up binding lists of nominees for appointment to the Supervisory Board and the Board of Management; amendments to the Articles of Association are subject to the approval of the Meeting of Holders of Priority Shares.\n\nPriority shares may only be transferred to a transferee designated by a Meeting of Holders of Priority Shares and against payment of the par value of the shares, plus interest at the rate of 6% per annum or the statutory interest in the Netherlands, whichever is lower, for the period between the beginning of the year and the date of transfer. There are no restrictions on voting rights of holders of common or priority shares. The Articles of Association set out procedures for exercising voting rights. The Annual General Meeting of shareholders has resolved in 2023 to authorize the Board of Management for a period of 18 months (i) to issue shares (or grant rights to shares) in the capital of the company up to a maximum of 10% of the total number of shares outstanding (and to restrict or exclude the pre-emptive rights to those shares) and (ii) to acquire shares in the capital of the company, provided that the shares that will at any time be held will not exceed 10% of the issued share capital. The issue or repurchase of shares requires the approval of the Supervisory Board.\n\n| Unrestricted reserves at year-end in \u20ac millions   | 2022   | 2023   |\n|---------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Shareholders' equity at year-end                  | 4,333  | 4,322  |\n| Subscribed share capital                          | (87)   | (85)   |\n| Subsidiaries' restrictions to transfer funds      | (190)  | (213)  |\n| Reserve for development costs                     | (106)  | (99)   |\n| Unrestricted reserves                             | 3,950  | 3,925  |\n\nIn February 2022, a \u20ac500 million share buyback program was announced, which was completed in 2022.

The contracts mainly relate to US dollars, pound sterling and Thai baht and all have maturities within one year. These contracts were partly offset by the foreign exchange contracts concluded with subsidiaries; fair value changes are recognized in the statement of income, or recognized in other comprehensive income in case hedge accounting is applied. For information on risk exposure and risk management, see Note 26 Financial risk management in the Consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Note J: Contingent liabilities\n\nAkzo Nobel N.V. is parent of the group's fiscal unity in the Netherlands, and is therefore liable for the liabilities of said fiscal unity as a whole.\n\nAkzo Nobel N.V. has declared in writing that it accepts joint and several liability for contractual debts of certain Dutch and Irish consolidated companies (Article 403 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code and section 357(1) of the Irish Companies Act 2014, respectively). These debts at year-end 2023 aggregate to \u20ac0.6 billion (2022: \u20ac0.6 billion), and are included in the consolidated balance sheet.\n\nAkzo Nobel N.V. has withdrawn its declarations of joint and several liability under Article 403 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code for certain Dutch former Specialty Chemicals subsidiaries divested as per October 1, 2018, and is following the procedures to terminate its residual liability under those declarations under Article 404 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code. One objection against the termination of residual liability is still pending and AkzoNobel, Nouryon and Nobian continue to cooperate to get this resolved.\n\nAdditionally, at year-end 2023, guarantees were issued on behalf of consolidated companies for an amount of \u20ac0.4 billion (2022: \u20ac0.4 billion). The debts and liabilities of the consolidated companies underlying these guarantees are included in the consolidated balance sheet.\n\nAkzo Nobel N.V. and two of its subsidiaries  are currently defending 2 claims brought by INPEX Operations Australia Pty Ltd and JKC Australia LNG Pty Ltd relating to the Ichthys Onshore Project in Darwin, Western Australia. A trial has been listed in the Federal Court of Australia, commencing June 17, 2024. The claims are contested and AkzoNobel denies liability in respect of both of these claims.\n\n## Note K: Independent auditor's fees\n\nOur independent auditor, PricewaterhouseCoopers Accountants N.V., has rendered, for the period to which the audit of the financial statements relates, in addition to the audit of the consolidated financial statements, mainly statutory audit services for controlled entities.\n\n## Fees PricewaterhouseCoopers Accountants N.V. 2023\n\n| in \u20ac millions                     | In the Netherlands   | Network outside the Netherlands   | 2023 Total   |\n|-----------------------------------|----------------------|-----------------------------------|--------------|\n| Audit of the financial statements | 4.3                  | 5.2                               | 9.5          |\n| Other audit services              | 0.2                  | 0.1                               | 0.3          |\n| Tax services                      | -                    | -                                 | -            |\n| Other non-audit services          | -                    | -                                 | -            |\n| Total                             | 4.5                  | 5.3                               | 9.8          |\n\n## Fees PricewaterhouseCoopers Accountants N.V. 2022\n\n| in \u20ac millions                     | In the Netherlands   | Network outside the Netherlands   | 2022 Total   |\n|-----------------------------------|----------------------|-----------------------------------|--------------|\n| Audit of the financial statements | 3.7                  | 5.5                               | 9.2          |\n| Other audit services              | 0.3                  | 0.1                               | 0.4          |\n| Tax services                      | -                    | -                                 | -            |\n| Other non-audit services          | -                    | -                                 | -            |\n| Total                             | 4.0                  | 5.6                               | 9.6          |\n\nAmsterdam, February 26, 2024\n\n## The Board of Management\n\n## The Supervisory Board\n\nGreg Poux-Guillaume\n\nMaarten de Vries\n\nBen Noteboom Ester Baiget Hans Van Bylen Byron Grote Pamela Kirby Dick Sluimers Patrick Thomas",

(\"the Company\") give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Company as at December 31, 2023, and of its result for the year then ended in accordance with Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code.\n\n## What we have audited\n\nWe have audited the accompanying financial statements 2023 of Akzo Nobel N.V., Amsterdam, the Netherlands. The financial statements comprise the Consolidated financial statements of the Group and the Company financial statements.\n\nThe Consolidated financial statements comprise:\n\n- \u00b7 The Consolidated balance sheet as at December 31, 2023\n- \u00b7 The following statements for 2023: the Consolidated statement of income, of comprehensive income, of changes in equity and of cash flows\n- \u00b7 The Notes to the Consolidated financial statements, including a summary of material accounting policies and other explanatory information\n\nThe Company financial statements comprise:\n\n- \u00b7 The Balance sheet as at December 31, 2023\n- \u00b7 The Statement of income for the year then ended\n- \u00b7 The notes, comprising a summary of the accounting policies applied and other explanatory information\n\nThe financial reporting framework applied in the preparation of the financial statements is EU-IFRS and the relevant provisions of Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code for the Consolidated financial statements and Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code for the Company financial statements.\n\n## The basis for our opinion\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with Dutch law, including the Dutch Standards on Auditing. We have further described our responsibilities under those standards in the section \"Our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements\" of our report.\n\nWe believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\n## Independence\n\nWe are independent of Akzo Nobel N.V. in accordance with the European Union \"Regulation on specific requirements regarding statutory audit of public-interest\n\nentities\", the \"Wet toezicht accountantsorganisaties\" (Wta, Audit firms supervision act), the \"Verordening inzake de onafhankelijkheid van accountants bij assuranceopdrachten\" (ViO, Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants, a regulation with respect to independence) and other relevant independence regulations in the Netherlands. Furthermore, we have complied with the \"Verordening gedrags- en beroepsregels accountants\" (VGBA, Dutch Code of Ethics).\n\n## Our audit approach\n\nWe designed our audit procedures with respect to the key audit matters, fraud and going concern, and the matters resulting from that, in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole and in forming our opinion thereon. The information in support of our opinion, such as our findings and observations related to individual key audit matters, the \"audit approach fraud risks\" and the \"audit approach going concern\", was addressed in this context, and we do not provide separate opinions or conclusions on these matters.\n\n## Overview and context\n\nAkzo Nobel N.V. is a global paints and coatings company headquartered in the Netherlands. Our group audit scope and approach are set out in the section \"The scope of our group audit\". In our audit we paid specific attention to the areas of focus driven by the operations of the Group, as set out below.\n\nAs part of designing our audit, we determined materiality and assessed the risk of material misstatement in the financial statements. In particular, we considered where the Board of Management made important judgments, for example in respect of significant accounting estimates that involved making assumptions and considering future",

        "page_content": "events that are inherently uncertain. In addition, we paid attention to, among others, the assumptions underlying the physical and transition risk related to climate change. In Note 1 of the Consolidated financial statements, the Group describes areas of judgment in applying accounting policies and the key sources of estimation uncertainty. We considered the valuation of the post-retirement benefit provisions and the valuation of deferred tax assets to be key audit matters as set out in the section 'Key audit matters' of this report, given the significant estimation uncertainty, the judgmental nature, the magnitude of the balances involved and the related higher inherent risk of material misstatement.\n\nThe Group executed over the past years a wide range of (finance) transformation projects. These projects continued in 2023, with the goal to align to the Group's evolving operating model, focusing on end-to-end processes and to increase operational efficiencies and effectiveness. Inherently, transformation processes encompass changes in the organization, systems, processes and controls.\n\nWe therefore evaluated the impact of these transformation projects on our audit. Due to the significance to the Group and the impact on our audit procedures, we included 'Ongoing transformation projects of the organization, systems, processes and controls' as a key audit matter, as set out in the section 'Key audit matters' of this report.\n\nGlobal market conditions were volatile in 2023 in terms of consumer confidence, (hyper) inflation and geopolitical developments. This resulted in different trends on the various (geographical) business areas of the Group. Certain areas showed recovery in terms of revenue and volume growth, other markets faced price pressure and/or the impact of softening demand. Total revenue showed relatively low volatility on a year-on-year basis. Overall, operating income increased.\n\nWe considered the impact of these global geopolitical and macro-economic developments on our audit approach, including our scoping, materiality and risk assessment. Furthermore, we assessed the impact on significant\n\nmanagement accounting judgments and future business and cash flow projections underpinning asset recoverability assessments, deferred tax asset recoverability, key assumptions used in the valuation of post-retirement benefit provisions, and the going concern assumption. We concluded the impact of the geopolitical and macro-economic developments on the Group's results of operations to be an area of focus that is not a separate key audit matter.\n\nClimate change is an area of interest to a wide group of stakeholders. Akzo Nobel N.V. assessed the potential effects of climate change and developed plans to meet the Group's announced emissions reduction commitments. The Group considered, among others, physical risks, such as those associated with water scarcity, flooding and weather events, as well as transition risks that can lead to changes in technology, market dynamics and regulations. Management also assessed the resulting impact on the financial position, including underlying assumptions and estimates. As part of our audit risk assessment, we gained an understanding of the Group's strategy and sustainability targets, evaluated the potential impact on the financial statements and discussed the assessment and governance thereof with management. We concluded the impact of climate change to be an area of focus that is not a key audit matter.\n\nOther areas of focus that we do not consider to be key audit matters were related to the impairment testing of goodwill and other intangibles with indefinite useful lives, accounting for the unwinding of the cash flow hedge in relation to the previously anticipated acquisition of Kansai Paints Africa, testing of the underlying assumptions of the other provisions and testing of the effectiveness of information technology general controls (ITGCs).\n\nWe ensured that the audit teams at both group and component level included the appropriate skills and competences which are needed for the audit of the Group. We therefore included in our team experts in the areas of pensions, share-based payments and valuations and specialists in the areas of tax, IT and treasury.\n\nThe outline of our audit approach was as follows:\n\n## Materiality\n\n- \u00b7 Overall materiality: \u20ac41.5 million (2022: \u20ac43.75 million)\n\n## Audit scope\n\n- \u00b7 We conducted audit work at 48 components in 18 countries (2022: 49 components in 18 countries)\n- \u00b7 Site reviews were physically conducted in five countries (2022: four countries) and virtually to one country (2022: three countries). In total, this covered 29 components (2022: 39 components)\n- \u00b7 Audit coverage: 62% of consolidated revenue (2022: 64%), 71% of consolidated total assets (2022: 72%) and 79% of consolidated profit before tax (2022: 67%)\n\n## Key audit matters\n\n- \u00b7 Ongoing transformation projects of the organization, systems, processes and controls\n- \u00b7 Valuation of post-retirement benefit provisions\n- \u00b7 Valuation of deferred tax assets\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Materiality\n\nThe scope of our audit was influenced by the application of materiality, which is further explained in the section \"Our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements\".\n\nBased on our professional judgment, we determined certain quantitative thresholds for materiality, including the overall materiality for the financial statements as a whole, as set out in the table below. These, together with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures on the individual financial statement line items and disclosures and to evaluate the effect of identified misstatements, both individually and in aggregate, on the financial statements as a whole and on our opinion.\n\n## Overall group materiality\n\nBasis for determining materiality\n\n## Rationale for benchmark applied\n\n\u20ac41.5 million (2022: \u20ac43.75 million)\n\nWe used our professional judgment to determine overall materiality. As a basis for our judgment, we used 5% of a three-year average of profit before tax, including the current year results.\n\nWe used profit before tax as the primary benchmark, a generally accepted auditing practice, based on our analysis of the common information needs of users of the financial statements. On this basis, we believe that profit before tax is the most relevant metric for the financial performance of the Group and is a metric widely used within the industry.\n\nConsistent with the methodology applied in prior year, we applied a three-year average of profit before tax.\n\nIn evaluating the approach taken, we considered among others, the impact of the macro-economic developments, including hyperinflation, and geopolitical tension and conflicts across the globe, as described in the section 'Overview and context' and the impact thereof on the financial results of the Group in addition to management's expectations and budget in the coming years. We reaffirmed that applying a three-year average is an appropriate basis for the current year audit that appropriately reflects the Group's scale of operations for the year. Applying a multi-year average benchmark for materiality responds to adverse economic trends and volatility in profit before tax from year to year. On this basis, we concluded that applying a three-year average is a more appropriate basis for the current year audit, and also better reflects the Group's scale of operations for the year.\n\nFurthermore, we used a 5% threshold, based on our professional judgment, noting it is within the range of commonly acceptable thresholds and the predominant threshold used for companies with similar characteristics\n\nBased on our judgment, we allocate materiality to each component in our audit scope that is less than our overall group materiality. The range of materiality allocated across components was between \u20ac8 million and \u20ac39 million.\n\nWe also take misstatements and/or possible misstatements into account that, in our judgment, are material for qualitative reasons.\n\nWe agreed with the Audit Committee and Supervisory Board that we would report to them misstatements identified during our audit above \u20ac2 million (2022: \u20ac2 million), as well as misstatements below that amount that, in our view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons.\n\n## The scope of our group audit\n\nAkzo Nobel N.V. is the parent company of a group of entities. It is managed by the Board of Management and Executive Committee. The financial information of this Group is included in the Consolidated financial statements of Akzo Nobel N.V.\n\nWe tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we, in aggregate, performed sufficient work on the financial statements to enable us to provide an opinion on the financial statements as a whole, taking into account the management structure of the Group, the nature of operations of its components, the accounting processes and controls, and the markets in which the components of the Group operate. In establishing the overall group audit strategy and plan, we determined the type of work required to be performed at component level by the group engagement team and by each component auditor.\n\nThe group audit included 21 components which were subjected to audits of their complete financial information, selected on the basis of the relative size of their operations. None of the components are individually financially significant to the Group. We further subjected 17 components to specific focused audit procedures on individual financial statement line items, such as revenue, cost of sales, inventories, trade and other receivables, post-retirement benefit provisions, tax, cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, based on the relative size or related higher inherent risk of material\n\n## Component materiality",

        "page_content": "misstatement. Additionally, we selected ten components for audit procedures to achieve appropriate audit coverage on specific financial line items in the Consolidated financial statements.\n\nIn total, in performing these procedures, we achieved the following coverage on the financial line items:\n\n| Revenue           | 62%   |\n|-------------------|-------|\n| Total assets      | 71%   |\n| Profit before tax | 79%   |\n\nNone of the remaining components represented more than 5% of total group revenue, total group assets or profit before tax. For those remaining components we performed, among other procedures, analytical procedures to corroborate our assessment that there was no significant risk of material misstatements within those components.\n\nFor all components we used component auditors who are familiar with the local laws and regulations to perform the audit work. We collectively performed hard close audit procedures on the interim October balance sheet positions and results. These hard close audit procedures included substantive audit work on certain material balances and transactions. Top-up testing was performed at year-end to cover the full-year period.\n\nWhere component auditors performed the work, we determined the level of involvement we needed to have in their work to be able to conclude whether we had obtained sufficient and appropriate audit evidence as a basis for our opinion on the consolidated financial statements as a whole.\n\nWe issued instructions to the component audit teams in our audit scope. These instructions included, among others, our risk analysis, materiality and the scope of the work. We explained to the component audit teams the structure of the Group, the main developments that were relevant for the component auditors, the risks identified,\n\nthe materiality levels to be applied and our global audit approach. We had individual calls with each of the inscope component audit teams throughout the audit. During these calls, we discussed the significant accounting and audit matters identified by the component auditors, their reports, the findings of their procedures, and other matters that could be of relevance for the financial statements.\n\nThe group engagement team attended physical or virtual site review meetings with a selection of the component teams and local management. During these meetings we discussed the strategy and financial performance of the local businesses, as well as the audit plan and execution, significant risks and other relevant audit topics. The financially most significant components are selected on a rotational basis (at least every three years) and other components are selected, depending on specific considerations which include, among others, audit observations, specific risks identified and other major events. In the current year, components in the following countries were selected: United States, China, Germany, United Kingdom, Italy and Indonesia.\n\nThe group engagement team performed the audit work on the consolidation, financial statement disclosures and a number of more complex areas and processes controlled and monitored centrally by Akzo Nobel N.V. These include impairment testing of goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives, testing of purchase price allocation for the acquisition of the Huarun business in China, share-based payments, valuation of deferred tax assets, group level other provisions and contingent liabilities, treasury, ITGCs and the Company financial statements. By performing the procedures outlined above at the components, combined with additional procedures exercised at group level, we have been able to obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence on the Group's financial information, to provide a basis for our opinion on the financial statements.\n\n## Audit approach fraud risks\n\nAs in all of our audits, we identified and assessed the risk of material misstatement of the financial statements due to fraud. Together with our forensic specialists, we evaluated fraud risk factors with respect to financial reporting fraud, misappropriation of assets and bribery and corruption.\n\nAs a starting point, we obtained an understanding of the entity and its environment and the elements of the system of internal control relating to fraud risks. We conducted interviews with members of the Board of Management, the Executive Committee, the Supervisory Board and others within the Group, including the Internal Audit and Integrity and Compliance function, to obtain an understanding of the Group's fraud risk assessment and the processes for identifying and responding to the risk of fraud and the internal control that management has established to mitigate these risks. Akzo Nobel N.V. has an integrity and compliance program, which includes a governance and organization structure, policies and procedures around risk management, policy management, communication, training and education, a competition law program, privacy program, anti-bribery and anti-corruption program, third party risk management program, monitoring, grievance and investigation procedures, and reporting. The Group also has an Export Controls and Sanctions team in place. We considered management's own risk assessment and response to the risk of fraud, management's monitoring of the system of internal control and how the Supervisory Board exercises oversight, as well as the outcomes thereof.\n\nAs described in the auditing standards, management override of controls and risk of fraud in revenue recognition are presumed significant audit risks.\n\nInherently, management of a company is in a unique position to perpetrate fraud because of its ability to manipulate accounting records and prepare fraudulent financial statements by overriding controls that otherwise appear to be operating effectively.

We addressed this risk by, among other procedures, evaluating journal entries, transactions outside the normal course of business and considering whether there was evidence of potential bias by management when making assumptions and estimates that may represent a risk of material misstatement due to fraud. We tested journal entries by selecting, on a riskbased approach through data analysis, certain entries posted along with sufficient and appropriate supporting evidence. To address the assessed risk of significant transactions outside the normal course of business, we performed, among others, procedures over the acquisition of the Huarun business in China. The audit procedures to respond to the assessed risk of management bias include, among others, evaluation of the design and the implementation of internal controls that intend to mitigate fraud risks (including management's fraud risk assessment, the Code of Conduct and whistle blower procedures), review of legal confirmations and correspondence with regulatory bodies, and retrospective review of prior year's estimates. For examples of key assumptions and estimates, refer to the key audit matters 'Valuation of post-retirement benefit provisions' and 'Valuation of deferred tax assets'.\n\nFurthermore, we, together with our forensic specialists, assessed matters reported through the Group's SpeakUp! program and complaints procedures and results of management's investigation of such matters if deemed applicable, and discussed this with the Audit Committee.\n\nWith regard to the risk of fraud in revenue recognition, based on our risk assessment procedures, we concluded that this risk is related to the occurrence of revenue transactions, due to the Group's strategy to continuously grow and expand market share. We performed procedures over this risk, including evaluation of the design and implementation of relevant internal controls, tracing a sample of revenue transactions to the supporting documents, and validating unusual journal entries.\n\nWe incorporated an element of unpredictability in our audit. During the entire audit, we remained alert to indications of fraud and considered the impact on our audit, if any. Furthermore, we considered the outcome of our other audit procedures and evaluated whether any findings were indicative of fraud or non-compliance with laws and regulations.\n\nBased on our risk assessment and audit procedures performed, we did not identify indications of fraud that resulted in material misstatements in the financial statements.\n\n## Audit approach going concern\n\nAs disclosed in Note 1 of the Consolidated financial statements, management performed their assessment of the Company's ability to continue as a going concern for at least 12 months from the date of preparation of the financial statements and has not identified events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company's ability to continue as a going concern (hereafter: going concern risk). Our procedures to evaluate management's going concern assessment included, among others:\n\n- \u00b7 Considering whether management's going concern assessment included relevant information of which we were aware as a result of our audit and inquiring with management regarding management's most important assumptions underlying its going concern assessment\n- \u00b7 Analyzing the financial position per balance sheet date, such as financial leverage and cash positions, in relation to the financial position per prior year balance sheet date to assess whether events or circumstances exist that may lead to a going concern risk, and liquidity management as disclosed in Note 26 of the Consolidated financial statements\n- \u00b7 Evaluating management's current budget, including expected future cash flows in comparison with last year, market developments, developments in the\n- macro-economic environment, climate-related developments and the relevant information of which we are aware as a result of our audit, including, among others, the cash flow projections\n- \u00b7 Performing inquiries of management as to their knowledge of going concern risks beyond the period of management's assessment\n\nOur procedures did not result in outcomes contrary to management's assumptions and judgments used in the application of the going concern assumption.\n\n## Key audit matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements. We have communicated the key audit matters to the Supervisory Board. The key audit matters are not a comprehensive reflection of all matters identified by our audit and that we discussed. In this section, we describe the key audit matters and include a summary of the audit procedures we performed on those matters.",

These projects continued in 2023, with the goal to align to the Group's evolving operating model, focusing on end-to-end processes and to increase operational efficiencies and effectiveness.\n\nThe Group's overall approach to governance, risk management and internal controls, its processes, outcomes, financial reporting and disclosures is subject to oversight by the Audit Committee.\n\nThe Audit Committee considered the impact of changes to systems, processes and controls, such as the IT landscape rationalization and the centralization of accounting operations and related internal controls in (global) business service hubs.\n\nInherently, transformation processes encompass changes in the organization, processes and culture and as such contribute to the risk of management override of controls, which is a presumed audit risk in our audit.\n\nGiven the possible pervasive impact this may have on our audit, we considered this a key audit matter.\n\nWe evaluated the impact of the transformation projects on systems, processes and controls on our audit.\n\nDuring our audit, we updated our understanding of the ongoing transformation projects relevant to our audit. We held discussions with management, global process owners, functional management and with the business service hubs management in order to understand the status of the transition, understand the processes and controls in place to address the changes in the internal controls and evaluate the maturity of the processes. In order to obtain further evidence of the implementation of the controls in place, we also performed walkthroughs on selected controls. Furthermore, throughout the year we attended the Audit Committee meetings where their considerations of the internal controls were observed. We used this information as part of our risk assessment procedures, including the evaluation of potential risk of fraud or error, and for the determination of the scope of our audit.\n\nFor new and changed IT systems and related ITGCs, we involved our IT audit specialists. We obtained an understanding of the project governance and change validation approach and we tested data migration and IT general controls. We used data analytics to identify unexpected journal entries.\n\nFrom the procedures performed, we did not have material findings with respect to the balance sheet positions and results recorded and disclosed.",

The largest pension plans are the ICI Pension Fund (ICIPF) and the Akzo Nobel (CPS) Pension Scheme in the UK, which together account for 86% of the defined benefit obligation (DBO) and 90% of the plan assets.\n\nWe consider the valuation of the largest post-retirement benefit provisions to be a key audit matter because positions are significant to the Group and the assessment process is complex and involves significant management judgment, which could be subject to management bias. The actuarial assumptions used include demographic assumptions (rates of employee turnover, disability, early retirement and mortality) and financial assumptions (discount rate, future salary development, benefit increases/indexation and inflation). Pension positions are also influenced by buy-in transactions. The Group's disclosures are included in Note 18 to the Consolidated financial statements. Technical expertise is required to determine closing positions.\n\nWith the assistance of our actuarial experts, we evaluated management's actuarial assumptions and the valuation methodologies applied, as well as the objectivity and competence of the Group's external pension experts used for the calculation of the postretirement benefit positions.\n\nWe have challenged management, primarily on their assumptions applied to which the postretirement benefit provisions are the most sensitive (discount rate, price inflation and life expectancy) by performing independent testing over the assumptions and methodologies used and comparing to the published actuarial tables, among others, with support of our actuarial experts.\n\nWe paid particular attention to the discount rate as disclosed by the Group in Note 18, given the significance.\n\nWe also tested the participant census data and the valuation of the plan assets through independent price testing (e.g. by reconciling to independently published market prices). In addition, we obtained third party confirmations on plan assets.\n\nFurthermore, we tested the buy-in transaction as disclosed in Note 18 to the Consolidated financial statements and we verified the appropriate accounting. We also assessed the adequacy of the Group's disclosure in that note.\n\nOur procedures did not result in material findings with respect to the valuation and disclosure of post-retirement benefit provisions at December 31, 2023.",

The assessment of the valuation of deferred tax assets in Germany, the Netherlands and the UK, resulting from net operating losses, tax credits and temporary differences, is significant to our audit as the positions are significant to the Group, calculations are complex and involve high estimation uncertainty and judgmental assumptions, which could be subject to management bias. The key assumptions include long term projections, tax planning strategies and local fiscal regulations. The Group's disclosures concerning income taxes are included in Note 8 to the Consolidated financial statements.\n\nWith respect to the valuation of deferred tax assets, we performed the following procedures with the assistance of our tax specialists:\n\n- \u00b7 We tested management's assessment of the recoverability of the deferred tax assets, by challenging their key assumptions. We specifically focused on the developments of the budget compared to the actual results in light of the recent macro-economic developments and forecast 2023.

The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the intentional override of internal control\n- \u00b7 Obtaining an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group's internal control\n- \u00b7 Evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Board of Management",

If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report and are made in the context of our opinion on the financial statements as a whole. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern\n- \u00b7 Evaluating the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and evaluating whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation\n\nConsidering our ultimate responsibility for the opinion on the Consolidated financial statements, we are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. In this context, we have determined the nature and extent of the audit procedures for components of the Group to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial statements as a whole. Determining factors are the geographic structure of the Group, the significance and/or risk profile of group entities or activities, the accounting processes and controls, and the industry in which the Group operates. On this basis, we selected group entities for which an audit or review of financial information or specific balances was considered necessary.\n\nWe communicate with the Supervisory Board regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit. In this respect, we also issue an additional report to\n\nthe Audit Committee in accordance with article 11 of the EU Regulation on specific requirements regarding statutory audit of public-interest entities. The information included in this additional report is consistent with our audit opinion in this auditor's report.\n\nWe provide the Supervisory Board with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related actions taken to eliminate threats or safeguards applied.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with the Supervisory Board, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.",

        "page_content": "We believe that the assurance information we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our conclusion.\n\n## Independence and quality control\n\nWe are independent of AkzoNobel in accordance with the 'Verordening inzake de onafhankelijkheid van accountants bij assurance opdrachten' (ViO, Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants, a regulation with respect to independence) and other relevant independence requirements in the Netherlands. Furthermore, we have complied with the 'Verordening gedrags- en beroepsregels accountants' (VGBA, Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants, a regulation with respect to rules of professional conduct).\n\nPwC applies the 'Nadere voorschriften kwaliteitssystemen' (NVKS, Regulations for quality systems) and accordingly maintains a comprehensive system of quality control including documented policies and procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards and other applicable legal and regulatory requirements.\n\n## Reporting criteria\n\nThe reporting criteria applied for the preparation of the Indicators are the AkzoNobel Reporting Principles Sustainability statements 2023, developed by the Company, as disclosed in section 'Basis for preparation' of the annual report 2023 and further elaborated in the document 'Reporting Principles Sustainability statements 2023', which was made available online 1 at www.akzonobel.com/en/about-us/sustainability-/ reporting-principles-.\n\nThe absence of an established practice on which to draw, to evaluate and measure non-financial performance indicators allows for different, but acceptable, measurement techniques, and can affect comparability between entities, and over time.\n\nConsequently, the Indicators need to be read and understood together with the reporting criteria used.\n\n## Responsibilities for the Indicators and the examination thereof\n\n## Responsibilities of the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board\n\nThe Board of Management of AkzoNobel is responsible for the preparation of the Indicators in accordance with AkzoNobel's Reporting Principles Sustainability statements 2023, including the identification of the intended users and the criteria being applicable for the purpose of these users.\n\nFurthermore, the Board of Management is responsible for such internal control as it determines is necessary to enable the preparation of the Indicators that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nThe Supervisory Board is responsible for overseeing the Company's reporting process on the Indicators.\n\n## Our responsibilities for the examination\n\nOur responsibility is to plan and perform our examination in a manner that allows us to obtain sufficient and appropriate evidence to provide a basis for our conclusion.\n\nOur conclusion aims to provide limited assurance. The procedures performed in this context consisted primarily of making inquiries with officers of the entity and determining the plausibility of the Indicators included in the Sustainability statements of the annual report 2023. The level of assurance obtained in a limited assurance engagement is substantially lower than the assurance that would have been obtained had a reasonable assurance engagement been performed.\n\n## Procedures performed\n\nWe have exercised professional judgement and have maintained professional skepticism throughout the\n\nexamination in accordance with the Dutch Standard 3000A, ethical requirements and independence requirements.\n\nOur examination consisted, among other things, of the following:\n\n- \u00b7 Evaluating the appropriateness of the reporting criteria used, their consistent application and related disclosures to the Indicators. This includes the evaluation of the reasonableness of estimates made by the Board of Management\n- \u00b7 Through inquiries, obtaining an understanding of internal control relevant to the examination in order to design assurance procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing a conclusion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control\n- \u00b7 Identifying areas of the Indicators where misleading or unbalanced information or a material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, is likely to arise. Designing and performing further assurance procedures aimed at determining the plausibility of the Indicators responsive to this risk analysis. These procedures consisted, among others, of:\n- -Interviewing management (and/or relevant staff) at corporate level responsible for the sustainability strategy, policy and results\n- -Interviewing relevant staff responsible for providing the information for, carrying out internal control procedures on, and consolidating the data resulting in the Indicators\n- -Determining the nature and extent of the procedures for locations. For this, the nature, extent and/or risk profile of these locations are decisive. Based thereon we selected locations to visit, being Vilafranca, Spain; Dongguan, China; and Col\u00f3n, Uruguay. Of these, one was a physical visit and two were virtual. These visits are aimed at, on a local level, observing parts of AkzoNobel's Health, Safety, Environment and Security (HSE&S) audits, validating source data and obtaining",

        "page_content": "## Greenhouse gas emissions - Scope 1 (direct) and Scope 2 (Indirect)\n\nThe total greenhouse gas emissions from processes and combustion at our facilities and indirect emissions from purchased energy in absolute measures (Mt CO2e) and kg CO2e per ton of production. Emissions from transport in own operations is very limited and therefore not material compared to other Scope 1 and 2 emissions. As transport is not material to Scope 1 and 2, these scopes exclude transport. We measure and report CO2 in line with the GHG Protocol. The other gases from the GHG Protocol are considered immaterial and not actively measured. For Scope 2 we make a distinction between market based and location based, the latter as from 2023.\n\n## Volatile organic compounds\n\nVolatile organic compound emissions in absolute measures (kilotons) and kg per ton production. Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are emitted as gases from certain solids or liquids, for instance from solvent-based paints.\n\n## Total waste\n\nTotal waste in absolute measures (kilotons) and kg per ton production. Waste is reported as total weight, not dry weight. Waste is any material arising from our routine operations which is not incorporated into final products and not directly released to atmosphere or direct to surface water.\n\n## Circular use of materials\n\nThe amount of materials reused by AkzoNobel and third parties (reusable waste plus by-products) divided by the total waste plus by-products (percentage).\n\n## Hazardous waste\n\nHazardous waste is waste that is classified and regulated as such according to the national, state, provincial or local legislation in place. Locations in countries where no appropriate legislation exists should consult their regional HSE&S manager for advice on hazardous waste classification of the different types of wastes generated.\n\n## Total waste to landfill\n\nAll hazardous and non-hazardous non reusable waste (in absolute measures (kilotons) and kg per ton production) as it leaves our premises in the reporting period, sent for disposal to landfill.\n\n## Total fresh water use and consumption\n\nFresh water use as absolute measure (million m 3 ) and m 3 per ton production.\n\nExtraction recorded as surface, ground and potable water Use recorded as cooling, process and other use (e.g. hygiene, grounds)\n\nThe majority of water is used for cooling and returned to the original source, slightly heated. Fresh water consumption as absolute measure (million m 3 ) and m 3 per ton production. Freshwater consumption is the fresh water use minus cooling water and water in product. Cooling water is excluded as it is extracted and returned from the same basin only with a potentially altered temperature (chemically unchanged).\n\n## Suppliers signed Business Partner Code of Conduct (% of spend)\n\nPercentage product related (PR) spend (measured in euro value) with suppliers (raw materials and packaging) who have signed our business partner Code of Conduct. Percentage non-product related (NPR) spend (measured in euro value) with suppliers who have signed our Business Partner Code of Conduct. Our Business Partner Code of Conduct states that we want to do business with business partners who endorse our ethical values and our social and environmental standards. We therefore require suppliers to sign our Business Partner Code of Conduct, which is based on the AkzoNobel Code of Conduct.\n\n## Suppliers sustainability risk analysis (baseline)\n\nNumber of suppliers who have been identified as risk to AkzoNobel due to their spend level (>\u20ac250,000), country risk (sensitive and emerging countries using EcoVadis' country risk profile) and/or category risk. Spend levels are\n\nbased on the prior reporting year, which means for the 2023 annual report, 2022 spend levels were used.\n\n## Suppliers participating in sustainability program\n\nNumber of suppliers who performed an EcoVadis online assessment or TfS onsite audit (in % of baseline as indicated under 'Sustainability risk analysis').\n\n## Suppliers in sustainability program - in line with expectations\n\nNumber of suppliers who meet our expectation in the EcoVadis assessment (in % of baseline as indicated under 'Sustainability risk analysis'): 45 total score and human right and labor score of 50.\n\n## Suppliers in sustainability program - under development\n\nSuppliers who have performed the EcoVadis assessment but who are not yet meeting our expectation. Suppliers have 3 years to reach the minimum EcoVadis scores (see 'Suppliers in line with our expectation').\n\n## Sustainable solutions\n\nA measure of the sustainability of our products, which have customer/consumer sustainability benefits, as percentage of our revenue. For 2023 and 2022, the reporting period for sustainable solutions is equal to the calendar year. A sustainable solution is a product or solution that has a sustainability benefit in one or more of the following sustainability criteria, when compared to other products or solutions which provide a similar functional effect/benefit to the user: reduced carbon and energy, health and well-being, less waste, reduced/reused and renewed material use and longer-lasting performance. A sustainable solution does not have any adverse effects in any of these sustainability criteria throughout the value chain.\n\n## Cradle-to-grave carbon footprint (Scope 1, 2 and 3)\n\nOur CO2(e) footprint in million tons of CO2(e) including Scope 1 (own operations), Scope 2 (energy use) and Scope 3 (upstream) and Scope 3 (downstream).

Downstream: category 10 - processing of sold products, category 11 - use of sold products, category 12 - end-oflife treatment of sold products.\n\nThe climate change impact of VOC emissions is included in the cradle-to-grave footprint, due to the impact VOC emissions have within the paints and coatings industry.\n\n## Social\n\n## Overall employee engagement index and Employee Net Promoter score (eNPS)\n\nWork engagement is defined as the employee's approach to their workplace. It's the level of commitment to the organization's goals and values, and the motivation to contribute to organizational success with an enhanced sense of well-being.\n\neNPS stands for Employee Net Promoter Score. It is a universal way of measuring employee satisfaction and engagement. eNPS is measured with one question; 'How likely is it that you would recommend your employer to a friend or acquaintance?' It is the only question in the survey for which the answer options range from 0 to 10 and not 1 to 5. (10 indicating 'Extremely likely' and 0 indicating 'Not at all likely'). The purpose of eNPS is to get a quick overview of the employees' satisfaction.\n\nThe eNPS is calculated: eNPS = % Promoters - % Detractors.\n\n## Female executives\n\nPercentage of women at executive level. Executive level includes all employees with an executive position grade at AkzoNobel and its subsidiaries, including the members of the Executive Committee who are not members of the Board of Management. Executive level further includes the\n\nmembers of the board of management and the supervisory board of each of Akzo Nobel Nederland B.V., Akzo Nobel Decorative Coatings B.V., Akzo Nobel Car Refinishes B.V. and International Paint (Nederland) B.V. The company's executives are considered as AkzoNobel's sub top as referred to in the Dutch Gender Diversity Bill implemented in 2022.\n\n## Total reportable injury rate (TRR)\n\nThe total reportable injury rate (TRR) is the number of injuries resulting in a medical treatment case, restricted work case, lost time case or fatality, per 200,000 hours worked. Temporary workers are reported with employees, since day-to-day management is by AkzoNobel. The classifications of injuries are in line with OSHA guidelines.\n\n## Lost time injury rate employees/temporary workers\n\nThe lost time injury rate (LTIR) is the number of injuries resulting in a lost time case per 200,000 hours worked. Temporary workers are reported together with employees since day-to-day management is by AkzoNobel.\n\n## Life-changing injuries\n\nLife-changing injuries are injuries to employees, temporary workers and contractors that are considered life-changing. This includes (but is not limited to): coma, some level of permanent disability (including loss of sight or hearing), organ removal, the requirement for ongoing multiple surgeries, lingering trauma, any amputation of digits or limbs, skin grafts and the insertion of plates, pins or screws. This category also includes fatalities.\n\n## Occupational illness rate employees\n\nThe total number of reportable occupational illness cases for the reporting period per 200,000 hours worked. This parameter is reportable for employees. Occupational illness is defined as any abnormal condition or disorder other than one resulting directly from an accident caused by, or mainly caused by, work-related factors over a period of time rather than an instantaneous event and recognized during the reporting year as part of national schemes or regulations. Occupational illness rate\n\nemployees includes illness related to mental health caused by work conditions.\n\n## Loss of primary containment - Level 1 and 2\n\nA loss of primary containment is an unplanned release of material, product, raw material or energy to the environment (including those resulting from human error). Loss of primary containment incidents are divided into three categories, dependent on severity, from small, onsite spill/near misses up to Level 1 - a significant escape. Refer to the full reporting principles on our website for further details.\n\n## Regulatory actions Level 4\n\nFormal legal notification with fines above \u20ac100,000 (Level 4).\n\n## Security incident Level 3\n\n'Serious incident' is an incident which has the clear potential to meet or meets incident criteria Level 1, 2 or 3. Refer to the full reporting principles on our website for further details.\n\n## AkzoNobel Cares (number of projects and number of people empowered)\n\nSocial impact programs effort; consists of four programs: 'Let's Colour', SOS Children's Villages, Education Fund and local AkzoNobel CSR projects (e.g. CSR in India and Pintuco Foundation in Colombia). Reported are: Number of local community members empowered with new skills and number of projects. AkzoNobel Cares projects are defined as a separate activity benefiting people in communities, involving AkzoNobel employees or funding, reported to the central AkzoNobel Cares team quarterly. The local community members empowered with new skills are people with vulnerable backgrounds, including young people at risk, who are trained in painting, professional and life/soft skills as a result of project/activity/participation delivered by AkzoNobel employees or through financial donations.",
