We are gradually developing them into intelligent platforms that control complex energy and data flows and provide customers with new options for dealing with energy. Without distribution networks there can be no energy transition and no climate protection. The expansion, modernization, and operation of distribution networks support security of supply and ensure the most efficient use of green electricity. This makes our networks the foundation of livable cities, communities, and regions.\n\n## Customer Solutions\n\nOur solutions help customers meet their personal energy needs and decarbonization goals. This includes energy sales, which offers a wide range of green electricity and green gas tariffs, as well as our solutions business, which provides innovative, sustainable, and digital products and services. Solar power systems, eMobility, energy storage, sensible energy control, and solutions for sector integration enable our customers to reduce their costs and emissions and also to increase their comfort and quality of life. This applies equally to residential customers and small businesses as well as large companies and municipalities.\n\n## Europe's energy system is becoming ever lower in CO2, more decentralized, and more digital. In short: more sustainable.\n\nOur two core businesses-energy networks and customer solutions-are playing a big role in making this happen. E.ON is one of Europe's largest operators of energy networks and energy infrastructure and providers of innovative customer solutions. The contribution of our roughly 75,000 employees is therefore crucial to successfully propelling the energy transition in Europe.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

On December 29, 2023, E.ON stock closed the year at a price of \u20ac12.15 compared with \u20ac9.33 at year-end 2022. High inflation, prime interest rate hikes along with concerns about more interest rate increases, economic uncertainty, the ongoing war in Ukraine, and the escalation of the Middle East conflict had a significant impact on the performance of European and German stocks in 2023.\n\n## Continuous Dividend Growth\n\nAt the 2024 Annual Shareholders Meeting on May 16, 2024, the Management Board and Supervisory Board will propose paying out a cash dividend of \u20ac0.53 per share for the 2023 financial year (prior year: \u20ac0.51). Based on E.ON stock's year-end 2023 closing price, the dividend yield is 4 percent. The payout ratio (as a percentage of adjusted net income) is 45 percent. Our dividend policy aims to offer our shareholders attractive dividend growth of up to 5 percent annually.\n\n## E.ON Stock Key Figures\n\n| Per share (\u20ac)                            | 2023   | 2022   |\n|------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Dividend 1                               | 0.53   | 0.51   |\n| Dividend payout 1  (\u20ac in millions)       | 1,384  | 1,331  |\n| Twelve-month high 2                      | 12.63  | 12.38  |\n| Twelve-month low 2                       | 9.47   | 7.41   |\n| Year-end closing price 2                 | 12.15  | 9.33   |\n| Market capitalization 3  (\u20ac in billions) | 33.77  | 24.65  |\n\n1 For the respective financial year; the 2023 figure represents management's dividend proposal.\n\n2 Source: NASDAQ.\n\n3 Based on ordinary shares outstanding at year-end.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Our mission is to provide prompt, precise, and relevant information at our periodic conferences and road shows worldwide-because maintaining regular communications and relationships is essential for good investor relations. The subsiding of the Covid-19 pandemic enabled us to carry out a significant part of our investor relations activities in 2022 in person. A hybrid approach of virtual and in-person activities has proven to be effective. This helps us communicate with capital markets efficiently and purposefully and meet our investors' needs.\n\n## Foresightful Funding, Stable Credit Rating\n\nDebt capital represents a very important financing source for the E.ON Group. That is why we focus on satisfying the demands of creditors as well as those of shareholders. During the year under review, the credit ratings of Standard & Poor's, Moody's, and Fitch remained stable, reflecting the confidence in E.ON's creditworthiness and thus supporting its competitiveness for future financing activities.\n\nE.ON issued euro-denominated bonds totaling \u20ac3.3 billion in the 2023 financial year and, at year-end 2023, had a solid funding situation that serves in part as prefinancing for the 2024 financial year. In addition, E.ON continually aims to maximize the diversity of its investor base to ensure that it has cost-optimized access to a variety of funding sources at all times. This periodically exploring opportunities for issuing bonds in other currencies.\n\nE.ON has a \u20ac10 billion Commercial Paper ('CP') program and a US$10 billion CP program, under which it can issue short-term notes.\n\nSustainability aspects play an increasingly important role in many international investors' decision for or against a particular investment. In 2021 E.ON became the first company to fully align its Green Bond Framework, under which it issues debt instruments whose issuance proceeds fund sustainable investment projects, not only with the ICMA Green Bond Principles but also with the EU Taxonomy. The EU Taxonomy Regulation defines which economic activities are classified as environmentally sustainable, thereby setting a Europe-wide standard for sustainable investment. E.ON generally intends to cover more than 50 percent of its annual financing requirements with green bonds. Green bonds accounted for about 75 percent of total bond financing of just under \u20ac2.5 billion in 2023. We provide detailed information on the topic of financing in the Financial Situation chapter.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

A lot has happened since then: the Covid pandemic, natural and climate disasters at many E.ON locations around Europe, the war in Ukraine and the attendant energy crisis, the uptick in interest rates, and Europe's economic downturn. All of this has presented us with enormous challenges. But none of it has altered our solid growth prospects. On the contrary, in 2023 we again defied difficult circumstances. We again delivered strong earnings-\u20ac9.4 billion in Group adjusted EBITDA-that exceeded our expectations for the 2023 financial year. And we again recorded growth in our financial results and investments. Our growth strategy, which is propelled by the trend toward sustainability and the need for full digitalization, remains valid. Our billions of euros of investments in the energy transition enable us to provide what Europe needs now more than ever: new energy infrastructure for sustainable, secure, and affordable energy.\n\nRenewables expansion is happening worldwide and in all types of locations. In France despite nuclear power. In Poland despite hard coal. In Asia despite the simultaneous expansion of conventional generation. In southern states of the USA despite the fact that\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nContents\n\nSearch\n\nBack\n\nLeonhard Birnbaum Management Board Chairman and CEO\n\nclimate action is almost a dirty word there. Part one of the transition is therefore well advanced and continues to progress inexorably. But part two is still almost at the beginning. The transition is no longer just about big wind and solar farms. It's about solutions for decarbonizing households and industry that, after the experiences of the energy crisis, are increasingly considered to be safeguards for a stable and affordable energy supply. It's about electrifying transportation and heating and air conditioning systems for buildings. And all of this requires network connections and a global expansion and upgrade of existing networks. The IEA's most recent World Energy Outlook predicts that global network infrastructure will need to be doubled.\n\nWe strategically aligned E.ON to precisely these needs. And we increasingly benefit from them. In the 2023 financial year, our two core segments-Energy Networks and Customer Solutions-grew in almost all of our European markets relative to the prior year. We're investing even more and even faster in the energy transition. We'll again massively expand our planned investments for 2024-2028 to a total of \u20ac42 billion compared with the \u20ac21 billion we'd planned for the five years starting in 2021.",

After all, the network business in particular has metamorphized in recent years. It has become a growth business that's increasingly attracting the attention of policymakers, the general public, and investors. For good reason: our networks are critical for the energy transition.\n\nThe final weeks of the 2023 calendar year almost marked something of a turning point in this regard. First, the European Commission adopted a Grid Action Plan, thereby putting grid expansion at the top of its energy transition agenda-something that would have been unthinkable just a few years ago. Second, just before Christmas, European policymakers also agreed on a constructive reform of Europe's electricity market design. All calls for more government intervention were met with a clear and correct message: the key to a sustainable, reliable, and affordable energy future is private investment. And in particular this means investments in network infrastructure and decarbonization solutions like those made by E.ON, one of Europe's leading companies in this area.\n\nI consider this to be a great opportunity for our Group. And we want to seize it by making our leading role in the energy transition even more visible. In the interests of our customers, in the interests of our shareholders, and in the interests of society at large. This means that we'll continue to invest to satisfy the rising demand for energy infrastructure. But it also means that we'll lead the way where others hesitate-like in the promising area of network flexibility. And it also means that in the future our corporate image will change.\n\nWe've purposely not rebranded E.ON during the Group's recent years of fundamental changes and restructuring. But if not now, when? We think it's time for our brand image to reflect our central role and our new self-confidence. And that's why we on the Management Board have made the unanimous decision to align the E.ON brand with our future growth and our leadership ambitions in the energy world.\n\nThese days, the public is getting to know E.ON in a new guise and with clear ambitions that go far beyond marketing. We're showing who we want to be: the playmaker of Europe's energy transition. And we'll do what a playmaker does: shape the game.\n\nBest wishes,\n\nLeo Birnbaum\n\n<!-- image -->",

The transformation of Europe's energy system in the wake of Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine continued to gain pace. E.ON played a key role in it. In a continued volatile market environment, it was necessary to reaffirm the implementation of E.ON's growth strategy and the accompanying significant investments in network expansion and decarbonization solutions. The energy industry will be where growth happens in the year ahead. This entails an obligation as well: realizing this growth potential is what will make E.ON successful. The Supervisory Board would like to thank the Management Board and all employees for the special efforts they made last year.\n\nIn the 2023 financial year the Supervisory Board carefully performed all its duties and obligations under law, the Company's Articles of Association, and its own rules and procedures. It advised the Management Board in detail about the Company's management and continually monitored the Management Board's activities, assuring itself that the Company's management was legal, purposeful, and orderly. At five regular meetings it\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nErich Clementi Chairman of the Supervisory Board\n\naddressed all issues relevant to the Company. In addition, it carried out one written resolution procedure. On a regular basis, the shareholder representatives and employee representatives made separate preparations for these meetings with the participation of one or several members of the Management Board. Three members were each unable to attend one Supervisory Board meeting; otherwise, all members attended all meetings.\n\nThe Management Board regularly provided the Supervisory Board with timely and comprehensive information about significant business transactions in both written and oral form. At the meetings of the full Supervisory Board and its committees, the Supervisory Board had sufficient opportunity to actively discuss the Management Board's reports, motions, and proposed resolutions. After thoroughly examining and discussing the resolutions proposed by the Management Board, the Supervisory Board voted on them when it was required by law, the Company's Articles of Association, or the Supervisory Board's rules and procedures. Furthermore, the Supervisory Board also met on a recurring basis without the Management Board being present.",

The reason is that sustainability is the centerpiece of E.ON's strategy and-in every dimension-the standard for our actions. An integrated report provides our stakeholders with a holistic and transparent view of our financial, environmental, and social performance.\n\n## Standards\n\nThis Integrated Annual Report applies to the E.ON Group as well as E.ON SE. E.ON is therefore fulfilling all requirements of International Financial Reporting Standards ('IFRS'), the German Commercial Code (German abbreviation: 'HGB'), and German Accounting Standards (German abbreviation 'DRS'). The combined Non-Financial Statement ('NFS') pursuant to Sections 315b and 315c in conjunction with Sections 289b to 289e of the HGB is fully integrated into the Combined Group Management Report. The Group Management Report thus contains information on five aspects: the environment, employees, social matters, human rights, as well as anti-corruption and anti-bribery. The NFS also complies with the disclosure requirements of the EU Taxonomy Regulation. The Non-Financial Statement ('NFS') Index indicates where these disclosures can be found in the Integrated Annual Report. In addition, the Disclosures Regarding Takeovers chapter is integrated into the Annual Report.\n\nE.ON's sustainability reporting, which consists of the NFS and other sustainability disclosures, is guided by the findings of its materiality analysis and topics relevant for stakeholders. It has been prepared with reference to the GRI Standards 2021 by the Global Reporting Initiative. The GRI standards covered by the content of a chapter are displayed on the first page of the chapter. The GRI Index provides an overview. The Other Information chapter contains E.ON's disclosures regarding the Electric Utilities and Power Generators Standards issued by the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board ('SASB'). E.ON is committed to the ten principles of the United Nations Global Compact ('UNGC') and supports the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals ('SDGs'). We describe our contributions to the SDGs in the Strategy chapter. Our climate-related reporting, which is based on the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures ('TCFD') as well, can be found in the chapter Climate Protection.\n\n## Scope\n\nThis report encompasses all subsidiaries that are fully consolidated in E.ON's Consolidated Financial Statements 2023. Any deviations are marked accordingly. KPI-based thresholds are used to distinguish companies that do not contribute significantly to the report. The next chapter, Business Model, contains more information about the E.ON Group's structure and business segments.\n\nThe reporting period is the 2023 calendar year. For most KPIs the corresponding prior-year figure is provided to improve comparability. Adjustments to prior-year figures of a KPI are explained in footnotes.\n\nStatements on the future development of E.ON and its subsidiaries are estimates based on information available at the time of reporting. Actual results may deviate from these statements.\n\nThe Corporate Governance Declaration is published on our website eon.com in the section Corporate Governance.\n\nThe Integrated Annual Report was published on March 13, 2024, and is available in German and English in pdf format. You can download the pdf version of this report at eon.com. The previous Integrated Annual Report was published in March 2023. You can find it and additional reports in the investor relations archive.\n\n## Language\n\nTo improve readability, we generally use the shorter name for companies and organizations (such as 'E.ON' rather than 'E.ON SE').\n\n## Sustainability Ratings\n\nE.ON's commitment to transparency includes subjecting its sustainability performance to independent, detailed assessments by specialized agencies and capital-market analysts. The findings of these assessments provide important guidance to investors and to E.ON. They help us identify our strengths and weaknesses and further improve our performance. The Sustainable Finance chapter presents the results of sustainability ratings.",

Content that is not part of the statutory audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements and is therefore excluded from the auditor's report is identified separately, as described below. For the NFS and selected additional sustainability information, a separate assurance engagement ('Sustainability Assurance') was also performed by KPMG AG in accordance with the International Standard on Assurance Engagements ('ISAE') 3000 (Revised) issued by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board ('IAASB'). The audit assurance applied to the different contents is clarified in the report by means of various symbols.\n\nSymbols next to headings [H2] apply until the next heading of the same level of hierarchy. Sections within the same chapter that were audited with a different assurance may be marked separately. This is done in longer sections by means of symbols next to the subheadings [H3] which apply until the next heading of the same level of hierarchy. In addition, individual sections or KPIs that are subject to a different audit assurance may be marked separately.\n\nThe corresponding contents are marked as follows:\n\n- \uf098 Not part of the statutory audit, audited with reasonable assurance as part of the Sustainability Assurance in accordance with ISAE 3000.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \uf09a Not part of the statutory audit, audited with limited assurance as part of the Sustainability Assurance in accordance with ISAE 3000; individual text passages are indicated by \u25ba\u25c4 .\n- \uf0d0 Not part of the statutory audit, unaudited; individual text passages are indicated by \u203a \u2039.\n\nPrior-year figures and quantified changes from the prior year included in sections marked as audited are, in principle, audited with the same degree of assurance as for the 2023 reporting year. Figures for 2021 were audited with limited assurance. Any deviations are indicated.\n\nThe precise scope of the audit is described in the Other Information section in the Independent Auditor's Report and in the report on the management review of sustainability information.",

The Group's core business is divided into two segments: Energy Networks and Customer Solutions. Corporate functions, equity interests managed directly by E.ON SE, and non-strategic operations are reported under Corporate Functions/Other.\n\n## Corporate Functions\n\nCorporate Functions' main task is to lead the E.ON Group. This involves charting E.ON's strategic course and managing and funding its existing business portfolio. Corporate Functions' tasks include optimizing E.ON's overall business across countries and markets from a financial, strategic, and risk perspective, conducting stakeholder management, and managing E.ON Energy Markets GmbH ('E.ON Energy Markets'), the Company's central commodity procurement unit. The E.ON Group's non-strategic activities, such as the operation of nuclear power stations until April 15, 2023, and their dismantling (managed by the PreussenElektra unit) and the generation business in Turkey are reported here as well.\n\n## Energy Networks\n\nThis segment consists of E.ON's power and gas distribution networks and related activities. It is subdivided into three regional markets: Germany, Sweden, and East-Central Europe/Turkey (which consists of the Czech Republic, Hungary, Romania, Poland, Croatia, Slovakia, and the stake in Enerjisa Enerji in Turkey, which is accounted for using the equity method). This segment's main tasks include operating its power and gas networks safely and reliably, carrying out all necessary maintenance and repairs, and expanding its power and gas networks, which frequently involves adding customer connections and the connection of renewable energy generation assets.\n\n## Customer Solutions\n\nThis segment serves as the platform for working with E.ON's customers to actively shape Europe's energy transition. This includes supplying customers in Europe (excluding Turkey) with power, gas, and heat, and providing them with solutions that enhance their energy efficiency, energy autonomy, and eMobility. E.ON's activities are tailored to the individual needs of customers across all categories: residential, small and medium-sized enterprises, large commercial and industrial, sales partners, and public entities. The E.ON Group's main presence in this business is in Germany, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Nordics (for example, Sweden, Denmark, and Norway), Italy, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Croatia, Romania, Poland, and Slovakia. In addition, Energy Infrastructure Solutions engages in activities aimed at decarbonizing commercial customers, cities, and communities, such as sustainable city solutions and district heating.\n\n## Significant Changes to the Business Model Effective January 1, 2024\n\nSome of the Energy Network segment's regional markets were reclassified effective January 1, 2024. East-Central Europe/Turkey is now divided into East-Central Europe (which includes the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Poland) and Southeastern Europe (which includes Hungary, Croatia, Romania, and our stake in Enerjisa Enerji in Turkey, which is accounted for using the equity method).\n\nIn addition, the Customer Solutions segment was renamed Energy Retail. Furthermore, the Energy Infrastructure Solutions (\"EIS\") was transferred from Energy Retail and has been an independent segment since January 1, 2024. We thus now report on its activities separately.\n\nFurthermore, the E.ON Group's central commodity procurement unit, E.ON Energy Markets, is reported at Energy Retail effective January 1, 2024. It was part of Corporate Functions/Other until December 31, 2023.\n\n## ESG Materiality and Stakeholder Engagement\n\n## ESG Materiality\n\nGRI 3-1, GRI 3-2\n\nE.ON has conducted an annual materiality analysis since 2006. The purpose is to identify and evaluate the sustainability topics that are most important to the Company and its stakeholders. This report contains information on the topics that the materiality analysis deemed to be particularly significant. It also partially addresses less material sustainability topics. E.ON thus aims to meet the different expectations of stakeholders as well as the requirements of environmental, social, and governance ('ESG') rankings and ratings. We provide an overview of the material and other topics in the Non-Financial Statement ('NFS') Index.\n\n## Identification of Material Topics\n\nIn 2023 E.ON conducted a materiality analysis in accordance with the requirements of the Non-Financial Reporting Directive ('NFRD'). The requirements of the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive ('CSRD') were taken into account, but not applied. We applied the double materiality principle: we considered the financial perspective as well as the impact perspective. The process had four steps, which are described below:\n\n## Step One: Topic Identification and Collection\n\nE.ON first gathered information and evidence on potentially material topics. We consulted a variety of sources, including regulations, reporting standards as well as statements from customers, competitors, investors, and non-governmental organizations ('NGOs'). We used this to create an overview of possible material topics. These were then compared with our existing material topics and collated. The basis for this was an evaluation that correlates a topic's frequency of mention to its importance for the industry. Experts from Sustainability, Group Accounting, and Investor Relations divisions reviewed and finally agreed on a short list of E.ON's potentially material topics.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n\uf098",

        "page_content": "- \u2192 About this Report \u2192 Corporate Profile \u2192 Climate Protection and Environmental Management \u2192 Employees and Society\n- \u2192 Governance \u2192 Sustainable Finance \u2192 Business Report\n- \u2192 Forecast Report \u2192 Risks and Chances Report\n- \u2192 Internal Control System \u2192 Disclosures Regarding Takeovers\n\n## Step Two: Impact Perspective\n\nE.ON analyzed the impact perspective by surveying NGOs, research institutes, suppliers, customers, and other stakeholders. We gave them a questionnaire containing the topics identified in step one and asked them to rate them. The questionnaire's findings were then examined in greater depth in stakeholder interviews. Representatives from the Sustainability, Group Accounting, Investor Relations, and Group Risk functions evaluated the survey's findings in a workshop, which concluded the impact analysis.\n\n## Step Three: Financial Perspective\n\nE.ON evaluated the financial perspective by examining the risks and opportunities associated with the ESG topics contained in its Enterprise Risk Management ('ERM') system. Another workshop, consisting of the same participants, was then held to assess and validate the financial materiality of the topics identified.\n\n## Step Four: Materiality Threshold\n\nE.ON finalized the list of topics by defining a common materiality threshold for the impact and financial perspectives. Only topics that exceeded it were considered material. To determine them, we held a third workshop consisting of the above-mentioned participants. The findings were then presented to the Sustainability Council, which approved E.ON's materiality analysis for 2023. The council is chaired by the Chief Sustainability Officer. He reports periodically to the E.ON Management Board on progress made.\n\n## Material Topics\n\nE.ON's sustainability reporting for the 2023 reporting year must for the last time reflect NFRD requirements. We therefore did not conduct a comprehensive update of our sustainability analysis pursuant to NFRD requirements. Instead, we conducted a Groupwide materiality analysis oriented toward the European Sustainability Reporting Standards 2 ('ESRS 2') in order to prepare for our first reporting pursuant to the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive ('CSRD') for the 2024 reporting year. We\n\nintegrated the approval of the update of our sustainability analysis pursuant to NFRD requirements from 2022 and assessed the prior year's findings to ensure they are up to date. Our CEO Leonard Birnbaum and our CFO Marc Spieker performed the final validation.\n\nThe findings of our NFRD materiality analysis for 2023, which are listed below, reaffirm the findings of the analysis from the prior year. The highest relevance from a financial and impact perspective was assigned to the following three topics:\n\n- \u00b7 Climate-change mitigation\n- \u00b7 Energy affordability\n- \u00b7 Reliable energy supply\n\nThe material topic of climate-change mitigation also encompasses customer solutions that mitigate climate change. Since both aspects-general climate-change mitigation and customer solutions that mitigate climate change-are extensive, they are presented in separate chapters in the Integrated Annual Report 2023.\n\nThe ESG chapters of this report provide information on E.ON's approach to managing its material topics and outline the Company's progress in the reporting year. The description of the management approach is based on GRI 3-3, Management of material topics.\n\n## Stakeholder Engagement\n\nGRI 2-28, GRI 2-29\n\nE.ON continually seeks dialogue with its various stakeholders. We want to listen to and understand their points of view and also to talk to them openly about the potential short- and long-term impacts of our business activities. This is an important objective of\n\nour daily work at the local, national, and European level. A stakeholder is any person who or any group that has an interest in a company. Stakeholder engagement is thus a core process of E.ON's corporate governance. The dialogue formats we choose vary by stakeholder and topic. They range from information campaigns and discussion forums with associations and NGOs to face-to-face discussions and lobbying. For example, E.ON is actively involved in the global investor initiative CDP (Carbon Disclosure Project), works with the United Nations Environment Programme ('UNEP'), and supports the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration. Furthermore, since 2021 E.ON has been part of the LEAF Coalition (Lowering Emissions by Accelerating Forest Finance), which is committed to biodiversity and the protection of tropical forests. More information on CDP and the LEAF Coalition can be found in the 'Climate Protection' chapter. E.ON is also a member of SolarPower Europe, a European association of energy suppliers and solar companies. The Solar Stewardship Initiative ('SSI') was set up as part of this association. Its aim is to create more transparency for solar-power supply chains and to ensure compliance with human rights.\n\nE.ON actively participates in policy debates on issues that affect the Company. We use a variety of channels for this, including lobbying, media interviews with our executives, and their appearances as public speakers. In addition, policymakers and regulators frequently invite E.ON to provide its technical and energy expertise as part of their decision-making processes. The Company offers its expertise proactively as well. This type of advocacy is important because the energy sector is significantly influenced by policy and regulatory decisions. Energy policy discussions in Brussels and Berlin focused on a future market design for the electricity market and the necessary expansion of infrastructure. Furthermore, E.ON takes part in discussions on energy, environmental, and climate policy in a variety of other forums. For example, Leonhard Birnbaum is part of the European CEO Alliance, an alliance of EU-wide business leaders who discuss ways to provide additional support to the EU Green Deal. Effective November 21, 2022, Leonhard Birnbaum was appointed acting",

BDI is a member of BusinessEurope, a European umbrella organization.\n- \u00b7 German Industry Initiative for Energy Efficiency (Deutsche Unternehmensinitiative Energieeffizienz, or 'DENEFF'): a multiindustry network of companies and organizations dedicated to enhancing energy efficiency.\n- \u00b7 Bitkom: through this industry initiative for a digital economy the Company is also represented in the Federal Association of German Industry (Bundesverband der Deutschen Industrie) and its European umbrella organization, BusinessEurope .\n- \u00b7 E.ON executives take part in the Economic Council of the CDU e.V. and the Economic Forum of the SPD e.V.\n- \u00b7 European Distribution System Operators for Smart Grids ('EDSO for Smart Grids'): European association promoting smart grids and the digitalization of the energy sector.\n- \u00b7 Energy UK: a trade association for energy in the United Kingdom.\n- \u00b7 Swedenergy: a private association of companies involved in electricity production, sale, and trading in Sweden.\n\n## Stakeholder Dialogue on Safe Post-Operations and Plant Dismantling\n\nE.ON subsidiary PreussenElektra is responsible for the safe postoperation and dismantling of its nuclear power plants ('NPPs'). Ongoing dialogue with stakeholders is essential. PreussenElektra communicates with a broad spectrum of stakeholders through press releases and briefings. The Company also uses events and forums to speak directly with its stakeholders and benefit from their feedback. The aim of all these measures is to provide transparent information and build trust.\n\nDialogue remains important during NPPs' dismantling as well. In 2023 PreussenElektra held press events at nearly all its NPPs. Annual power plant talks with key local stakeholders took place in the fall as well. Some plants also have dialogue groups for nearby residents, in which PreussenElektra also participated in 2023. People who live near Brokdorf, Isar, and Grafenrheinfeld NPPs and other stakeholders were given the opportunity to visit the plants on selected dates.\n\n## Strategy\n\n## 2023: Markets Calm Down, E.ON's Strategy Remains Right on Course\n\nOverall, the situation on energy markets in 2023 improved compared with the severe turbulence of 2022. At E.ON, we perceive this in all our regions. The tensions are still noticeable, however, and our prudent planning reflects this. E.ON mastered last year's challenges by consistently implementing our strategy focusing on sustainability, digitalization, and growth-because this strategy has proven to be robust even in times of crisis. Our strategy to be and remain the green energy transition company in\n\nEurope therefore remains right on course. We are the playmaker of Europe's energy transition and made significant progress in 2023.\n\nThe energy crisis in 2022 accelerated the energy transition by putting the need for sustainable energy systems into even sharper focus. The energy transition is therefore not only an urgently necessary response to climate change, but also an opportunity for Europe and Germany to simultaneously remain competitive and resilient and thus pursue a sustainable path out of the energy crisis. The policy decisions of Germany's Easter package of renewables legislation show that the emphasis on energy security and energy autonomy-along with the resilient and digital energy infrastructure it requires-has become even more important. E.ON is one of Europe's largest operators of electricity and gas networks, and the growth strategy we launched in 2021 therefore puts us right on track to continue propelling and ensuring supply security and multisector decarbonization. The crisis has also made us realize that we must always think about sustainability, supply security, and energy affordability together and that the maxim of E.ON's actions must be to achieve a balance between these three requirements.\n\nGermany is part of Europe's energy market. The shutdown of Germany's last nuclear power plants in April 2023 and its plan to phase out coal by 2030 make this fact increasingly important. Ensuring supply security and energy affordability can only be achieved by expanding renewables faster. Renewables expansion, in turn, promotes sustainability, but can only succeed if it is accompanied by significantly more and faster network expansion.\n\nWe are also at a turning point. The energy transition is now primarily a heating transition, which already directly affects every individual or will do so in the future. For example, 2023 was already characterized by a strong desire among customers for more autonomy and sustainability. One of the upshots of this was high demand for heat pumps. The heating transition was thus already readily apparent in 2023. Making the energy transition a",

It is technically feasible, but the question is at what price. Investments in networks can only be made in a reliable and economically attractive regulatory environment. Less bureaucracy and more innovation are necessary, too. \u2039\n\nAt Energy Networks, 2023 was primarily characterized by organic growth and the consistent implementation of our strategy. Ongoing renewables expansion led to a further increase in demand to connect these facilities to networks and to expand network capacity. Investments in the 2023 financial year went mainly toward network expansion and infrastructure modernization and digitalization. A significant proportion of Europe's renewables capacity is connected to the E.ON Group's grids; indeed, the one millionth renewables facility was connected to E.ON's network in Germany in October 2023. These networks are not only the backbone of the green energy transition-which E.ON's considerable investments continue to propel-but also one of the most critical pieces of social infrastructure. It is clear that the energy transition will not be possible without the underlying network infrastructure.\n\nThe successful implementation of our growth strategy which emphasizes our promise to provide secure and affordable energy was also reflected at Customer Solutions in 2023. Our dynamic management of prices, customer churn, and our portfolio made a significant contribution to stabilization after the crisis. Our focus was always on supply security, affordability, and a sustainable\n\nenergy supply. Wherever it was economically feasible, E.ON always passed lower market prices through to households and reduced end-customer prices after the significant increases that resulted from the crisis in 2022.\n\nOverall, this too demonstrates that the strategic course we setmeasured by the high demand for intelligent solutions and products for decarbonizing households and industry-remains stable and will become increasingly important in the future.\n\n- \u25ba E.ON's wide range of products and services enables our customers and partners to displace over 100 million metric tons of CO2 annually. \u25c4\n\nThe primary feature of 2023 at our Energy Infrastructure Solutions ('EIS') business was the obtaining of new contracts that will enable us to offer our customers additional decarbonization solutions in the future.\n\n\u203a At our partner Imerys in Belgium, for example, we installed a generating unit that runs entirely on industrial synthesis gases that result from Imerys's production processes. The unit can supply not only Imerys's production facility but also 40,000 households in the region with electricity year-round. In Poland we signed a contract to develop a project to generate energy from waste heat. These two projects alone will result in annual carbon savings of 81,000 metric tons per year. These kinds of assets are still lighthouse projects, but we want to make them the standard. Among other things, they make a significant contribution to the competitiveness and decarbonization of Europe's economy. We therefore made tangible year-on-year progress, not only in further developing this business and growing E.ON, but also in delivering on E.ON's ambitions to make Europe's energy system more sustainable. \u2039\n\nDemand for our sustainable energy solutions is likewise continuing to rise. Not only did our Future Energy Home business record growth by offering decarbonization solutions for households, primarily in newly tapped markets. Our eMobility business\n\ncontinued to expand by means of a Europe-wide strategic partnership with BMW for home charging as well as our acquisition of startup elvah. Elvah's app is designed to make it easier to find available, reliable, and affordable charging stations and also helps us better utilize our charging network.\n\nAlongside our existing partnerships with Berlin and Malm\u00f6, in 2023 we forged our first strategic energy partnership in England with the city of Coventry-the headquarters of E.ON UK plc-to jointly develop and propel decarbonization as well as social projects.\n\nThe pace of our digitalization, which is a key success driver, is swift as well. We are digitalizing across E.ON. We defined technological standards for the entire E.ON Group in order to harmonize our IT landscape. Our common technology platform is designed to ensure our IT landscape's efficiency and reliability while maintaining a high degree of flexibility by means of a modular setup centered on an application-programming interface ('API'). This includes a continued focus on a clear cloud strategy. Using the cloud enables us to achieve greater stability and shorter recovery times, while at the same time enhancing the flexibility of our workloads' performance. E.ON has migrated more than 95 percent of applications from its data centers to the cloud, and we are already seeing that the cloud makes our data landscape more stable and secure. It forms the basis for the modernization of our business processes and simplifies and accelerates the development of new digital services for the energy transition. The digitalization of our Group provides us with greater efficiency, higher security, and more flexibility for swifter scaling. In a dynamic market environment like ours, digitalization can give us a significant competitive advantage. In addition, we are committed to providing our entire workforce with adequate training and development. We rolled out a new digital learning platform that provides all our employees with the skills they need to propel the digitalization of our business processes and products according to their individual requirements. These efforts are supported by a growing core of digital experts who promote digitalization projects in all our",

The new organizational setup reflects E.ON's conviction that digital innovations in particular-like Elna, a smart meter service we launched in Sweden, and Evercharge, a solution for preventing charging point outages-are key value drivers in the energy transition.\n\nThese are all important steps on the path to a sustainable transformation of the energy system. It is a long-term task and requires political support and appropriate framework conditions. It is becoming increasingly clear that the energy transition has reached one of its larger challenges: the heating transition. This will require considerable investments in networks and a fundamental reconfiguration of the entire infrastructure. Being an active partner to around 6,000 municipalities in Germany positions E.ON well to successfully support and implement municipal heat planning and Germany's Building Energy Act.\n\nE.ON laid the foundation stone for the energy transition in the heating sector by creating a digital heat map for municipalities and citizens, which we officially presented to the Federal Minister for Housing, Urban Development, and Construction in November 2023.\n\nThe use of hydrogen as a substitute for coal, gas, and oil in industry will continue to play an important role in the transformation of the energy system. Extensive investment in energy infrastructure is necessary here, too. All of this offers us new opportunities and again reaffirms E.ON's strategic course.\n\n## 'Making new energy work'\n\nWe are the playmaker of change in the energy industry. Leading the way for innovative, sustainable, digital-first solutions that transforming the way Europe is powered for all.\n\nThis clear purpose send an unmistakeable message. It indicatesas our mission statement already implies-that we will continue to emphatically implement our established strategy whose three key elements are sustainability, digitalization, and growth.\n\n## Sustainability\n\nE.ON's strategy fits seamlessly with the European Union's decarbonization agenda. Europe's distribution networks-E.ON's biggest business-are where the energy transition is happening. The investments necessary to upgrade, expand, and digitalize these networks through 2030 are estimated at over \u20ac425 billion. The European Commission's desire to accelerate this expansion will be an additional driver.\n\nClimate protection will be one of the key drivers of E.ON's future growth. The Science Based Targets initiative ('SBTi') validated E.ON's climate targets in May 2022. They are consistent with keeping global warming to 1.5\u00b0C above preindustrial levels. In addition, E.ON pledges for its Scope 1 and 2 emissions to achieve climate neutrality by 2040 (and to cut Scope 1 and 2 emissions by roughly 75 percent by 2030). E.ON intends for its Scope 3 emissions to be climate-neutral by 2050 (and to reduce them by about 50 percent by 2030). All reductions are relative to 2019. These objectives set a course that is both ambitious and viable: a reduction path consistently aligned with the new energy world and E.ON's strategy. In addition, E.ON voluntarily offsets a portion of the emissions it is currently unable to avoid. Offsets help fund measures that prevent or remove carbon emissions outside our value chain. All offsets are currently not factored into E.ON's climate targets, but rather are made at the product level. E.ON's most important offsetting program is the partnership it has had since 2021 with the LEAF Coalition, which stands for Lowering Emissions by Accelerating Forest Finance. LEAF offsets help protect tropical forests and manage them sustainably. E.ON's LEAF program will initially run through year-end 2027.\n\nESG aspects are systematically embedded into E.ON's central control and management processes. In addition, each business\n\nunit's management team is responsible for taking action to enhance sustainability and to meet the unit's sustainability targets. This decentralized approach enables the units to contribute to E.ON's Group-wide targets for issues like climate protection and corporate governance, while also tailoring their actions to their specific needs. Each unit has sustainability staff who reinforce awareness, coordinate projects and initiatives, and monitor progress toward targets. They share information at regular intervals with our Sustainability Council and the E.ON Group's Sustainability team.\n\n## Digitalization\n\nDigitalization will be a cornerstone of the energy landscape of the future. The transition toward an interconnected, volatile, and networked energy world is being accompanied by increasing complexity that can only be managed through comprehensive digitalization. Digitalization is thus an important lever in E.ON's growth strategy and the basis for generating additional value in its core business over the long term. E.ON's objective is to become one of the leading digital energy companies and to fundamentally transform its products, processes, and services into data-driven and highly interconnected solutions. Our digital transformation is proceeding along four strategic pathways: optimizing internal operations, engaging customers and partners, transforming and developing new business areas, and enhancing employees' digital skills. The centerpiece of our digital transformation is a common technology platform ('CTP') for the entire Group. The CTP will serve as the basis for standardizing and harmonizing all applications in the E.ON Group necessary for the energy transition now and in the future. It will enable us to develop new digital energy solutions while maintaining the highest security standards.\n\nThe foundation of E.ON One has enabled the E.ON Group to pursue the objective of offering and operating innovative digital energy solutions for the external market and for E.ON Group companies. E.ON One's portfolio is formed by targeted investments in E.ON's own innovations and in startups. This will make it possible to smartify networks and render energy consumption more",

E.ON One focuses on three business areas: grid management, grid operations, and energy management solutions. These areas form the basis of a successful energy transition. E.ON One offers a wide range of energy management solutions that give customers more transparency about their consumption and that aims to optimize consumption and generation.\n\nEnergy Networks' top priorities include standardization, smartification, and the development of new digital solutions, all with the highest cybersecurity standards. Digitalization helps E.ON operate its networks even more efficiently and optimally manage the growing proportion of power from renewable generating facilities. The development of digital solutions like smart eMobility charging solutions as well as new services in front of and behind standard residential meters and smart meters are also part of E.ON's growth strategy.\n\n## Growth\n\nE.ON's core business consists of two segments: Energy Networks and Customer Solutions. E.ON operates power and gas networks in various regions of Europe and offers a broad range of customer solutions. The two businesses complement each other amid the transformation of global energy systems. They are also clear growth businesses that benefit from the sustainable transformation of various customers and industrial sectors. As a result, E.ON's business opportunities are expanding as well. Our growth strategy also fits seamlessly with Europe's decarbonization ambitions: because of the ongoing build-out of renewables and the resulting greater challenges for power networks, systemic change in power distribution networks will, as already mentioned, require investments of more than \u20ac425 billion. According to the most recent statements by the German Federal Network Agency, about \u20ac150 billion of investments will be required for distribution networks in Germany alone. E.ON's distribution networks alone will connect several million new renewables facilities over this time period. In addition, the growth in the aggregate energy demand of E.ON's customer groups is estimated to increase by more than 100 percent between 2020 and 2050. A sustainable\n\ntransformation of the economy is necessary for this as well. E.ON is aiming for earnings growth in both the Energy Networks and Customer Solutions segments, supported by continual efficiency improvements. The focus is primarily on achieving operational excellence. We are likewise aware that our growth strategy will only be successful if it is accompanied by changes within our organization, such as cultural change, diversity, and education.\n\n## Growth in the Energy Networks Segment\n\nThe transition to a new, sustainable, and interconnected energy world will require considerable investments in physical and digital assets. As stated above, this applies above all to the Energy Networks segment, whose Networks are the platform for a successful energy transition. Ongoing renewables expansion in particular will require grids to grow at a similar pace. New network connections and connected load will increase sharply amid the energy transition owing to changes in customer behaviour. The energy transition alone therefore represents an unprecedented growth opportunity for E.ON, an opportunity that is being further accelerated by the current developments in Europe's energy system. Consequently, this growth will be accompanied by a suitable and sensible digitalization of networks because they are a key component of E.ON's growth strategy and a prerequisite for the implementation of the energy and climate transition in distribution networks. The use of smart-grid technology (such as smart energy meters and smart transformer stations), the integration of external data, and the standardization of construction and operating processes will make it possible to realize considerable potential. Where necessary for technical reasons and economically feasible, E.ON will acquire the capability to monitor and control its distribution networks across all voltage levels in order to optimize their operation. Sensors and smart metering and control technology will enable real-time control of distributed generation and consumption.\n\nThe energy and heat transitions will alter the role of gas networks as well. E.ON is already working on plans, such as making gas network infrastructure hydrogen-ready. E.ON will therefore,\n\nwhere legally possible and economically sensible, make its existing gas networks hydrogen-ready. These investments will help pave the way toward climate-neutral gas networks.\n\nThis is among the reasons why E.ON is one of Europe's leading distribution system operators. E.ON has a regulated asset base ('RAB') of \u20ac42 billion, and its regulated business generates a large share of its EBITDA. E.ON's strategic objective is therefore to remain Europe's leading energy and infrastructure partner. A large portion of investments during the 2024-2028 planning period will again go toward network expansion and a variety of network projects. The Forecast Report contains details about planned investments.\n\n## Growth in the Customer Solutions Segment\n\nThe Customer Solutions segment focuses on the offering of energy solutions (such as Future Energy Home or 'FEH,' eMobility, and green gas) and the decentral activities of the Energy Infrastructure Solutions ('EIS') business, as well as power and gas sales. This is a scalable business model with comparatively low capital requirements and focuses on private households and small and medium-sized enterprises. E.ON's objective for this business is to retain its roughly 47 million customers (including customers in Turkey and at ZSE in Slovakia) in the long term by offering them sustainable energy solutions and services and thus reducing their environmental footprint and reaching energy conservation targets, particularly regarding residential customers' gas consumption. So that this objective can be achieved at competitive costs, E.ON systematically pursues digitalization, which promotes optimal operational efficiency, superior customer satisfaction and loyalty (customer relationship management), and cross-selling opportunities. In addition, E.ON focuses primarily on offering distributed energy systems for households, such as the selfgeneration of green solar power, energy storage, heat, and eMobility solutions. The European Commission's solar strategy for the EU, which includes the target of doubling Europe's solar power capacity by 2025, remains an additional growth driver.",

The eMobility market continues to undergo change and is characterized by strong growth: policymakers want at least 15 million electric vehicles to be registered in Germany by 2030. The time for rapid growth activities is now, because all attractive locations for the charging infrastructure necessary for this objective will presumably have been allocated in the years ahead. Our objective is to enlarge our current market position and become one of Europe's leading operators of charging infrastructure by 2030.\n\n- \u25ba In 2023 E.ON sold 23,923 charging points for residential and business customers in many European countries. \u25c4\n\nEIS's activities encompass innovative energy solutions that aim to help cities, municipalities, and industrial customers achieve their climate targets cost-effectively. E.ON aims for its EIS business unit to achieve additional growth and become the preferred transformation partner for sustainable, innovative energy solutions. EIS's core business consists of a portfolio of solutions for decentral power, heat, and cooling plants as well as solutions for energy efficiency and decarbonization along with other energy services. E.ON sees green hydrogen in particular as a key strategic growth opportunity over the medium term, and founded E.ON Hydrogen GmbH to meet rising demand for green gases in the future. Hydrogen will play an essential role in the climate-neutral energy system of the future. E.ON plans to develop a national and international hydrogen business. Our international footprint in Europe gives us optimal local conditions for future hydrogen clusters, for example in the North Sea region. Selected partnerships for developing this business include, for example, French energy company EDF, Everwind Fuels, Tesla, and Fortescue Future Industries.\n\nE.ON is thus well positioned to propel the energy transition and satisfy the increasing demand for sustainable solutions. All business units benefit from robust growth in the demand for green\n\npower and gas across all sectors (households, transportation, buildings, and industry).\n\n## Commitment to the UN Sustainable Development Goals\n\n\u203a The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals ('SDGs') of its 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development provide a blueprint for a better and more sustainable future. Adopted in 2015, the 17 SDGs and 169 subgoals address a wide range of global challenges. We recognize the SDGs' importance. Our Management Board underscored this support by issuing a self-commitment to the SDGs in June 2018. E.ON's core business activities enable it to play a considerable role in fostering the SDGs 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy), 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities), and 13 (Climate Action). All of E.ON's other contributions to the UN SDGs can be found in the SDG Index. \u2039\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Finance Strategy\n\nThe section of the Combined Group Management Report entitled Financial Situation as well as the E.ON on Capital Markets chapter contain explanatory information about E.ON's finance strategy.\n\n## People Strategy\n\nThe sections of the Combined Group Management Report entitled Working Conditions and Diversity and Inclusion contain explanatory information about the main components of E.ON's people strategy as well as statements about diversity at E.ON.\n\n## Innovation\n\n## Innovations: Pioneering New Solutions En Route to Climate Neutrality\n\nAt E.ON, we focus on innovations to develop new solutions en route to climate neutrality. They help us quickly and reliably design safe, user-friendly digital products, processes, and systems for our Energy Networks and Customer Solutions segments as well as the E.ON organization.\n\nOur Innovation division focuses on developing new customer solutions and deploying new technologies while assessing the opportunities and possibilities as well as the risks associated with the use of modern technology. The public and scientifictechnological debate about artificial intelligence ('AI') and generative AI or Gen AI has led E.ON, too, to take a close look at their opportunities and risks. For example, E.ON is testing various Gen AI solutions for integrated knowledge and information flows, information on strategic trends, improved operational planning, the design and implementation of business processes, and for the creation of value for customers and employees.\n\n## Collaboration in Global Networks and Partnerships Accelerates Innovations\n\nE.ON has worked in recent years to establish Group-wide structures and processes for in-house collaboration and partnerships to develop innovations. E.ON is convinced that new business models that are significant for its future business can be developed better, more easily, and faster in collaboration with universities and other scientific institutions as well as various partners and networks of a global innovation ecosystem. In 2023 this integrated partnership approach enabled E.ON to extend its position in the implementation of energy transition projects as well as in innovation.\n\nE.ON manages two key business initiatives, known as innovation engines, to deploy innovations generated by outside start-ups, by",

EGI is also responsible for our partnerships with universities, such as the Energy Research Center, a joint venture between E.ON and RWTH Aachen University, and our partnership with the Bits&Watts program at Stanford University in California.\n- \u00b7 E.ON One GmbH (see page 34) is a growth and sales platform for market-ready digital solutions. E.ON One acquires startups, integrates their digital solutions into E.ON's system architecture to ensure their scalability and operational reliability, and markets them to distribution network and sales companies in and outside E.ON.\n\nThese innovation engines and close collaboration with the business units' innovation activities enable E.ON to ensure that it implements its innovation strategy effectively and efficiently.\n\n## Energy Research: Foundation for Developing Climateneutral Innovations\n\nE.ON conducts extensive research activities to gain important insights into key strategic technologies and developments of the future. We focus on four topics: technology forecasts and analyses, the establishment and design of distributed sustainable energy systems, and the development of programs for comprehensive decarbonization and sustainable heat supply.\n\nIn 2023 E.ON's research and technology team again extended its international academic influence through a collaboration with Stanford University in California. We also successfully completed 16 projects as part of our long-standing partnership with RWTH Aachen University in Germany; 19 more are currently in progress, including strategically important and business-oriented projects,\n\n## Global Innovation Ecosystem Affords Access to New Technologies and Solutions\n\nIn 2023 E.ON successively expanded its collaboration with global partners, whose networks yield innovation projects and the development of new business models. E.ON is thus pursuing its goal of drawing on a consistently well-filled innovation pipeline to continually deploy innovations in its operating business. In addition, E.ON tests the possibilities of new business activities, particularly together with its innovation teams in Silicon Valley (United States) and Tel Aviv (Israel), and monitors the development of disruptive innovations in which it sees the potential to generate new business opportunities or set market standards.\n\n## Global Partner Network Helps Deploy Innovations across E.ON Group\n\nSince 2018, E.ON has worked with six other multinational energy utilities from Europe, North America, Australia, and Asia in Free Electrons, a global accelerator program. The aim is to jointly identify promising startup solutions that enable and accelerate the energy transition. In 2023 we reached two new milestones: we entered into partnerships with U.S.-based Rondo to use heat storage help decarbonize industrial processes and with Naked Energy of the United Kingdom, whose solar thermal and hybrid technology we use to develop renewable heat solutions for largescale industrial and urban decarbonization projects.\n\nE.ON held its successful Grid Startup Challenge innovation program for the fifth year running in 2023. All 18 E.ON network companies participated. The 2023 event again yielded six new pilot projects that help make network infrastructure more efficient, sustainable, and resilient. For example, international startups Qube and Aeromon support E.ON subsidiary Westenergie by providing autonomous, compact laser sensors for detecting methane leaks in gas distribution networks. Another startup, Neuron Soundware,\n\nsupplies E.ON with an AI-based technology that uses acoustic signals to swiftly detect and analyze faults in substations.\n\n## Seagrass: A New Concept for Trading Carbon Certificates\n\nSeagrass Limited, a new E.ON subsidiary founded in 2023, is tapping the potential of the voluntary carbon market to accelerate the transition to net-zero emissions and propel decarbonization globally. One example is the Seagrass Carbon Map. It shows the locations and projects that back carbon certificates. Seagrass also increases transparency in the carbon certificate market by providing additional information-such as satellite images, land use, and biomass data-on the projects' locations. A prototype of the Seagrass Carbon Map was presented at COP28, the UN Climate Change Conference in Dubai.\n\nSeagrass holds a financial services permission, which allows it to act as an intermediary on the carbon certificate market and bring together the market's supply and demand sides. Seagrass cooperates with an established exchange (ACX) to process carbon certificate purchases and sales.\n\n## Central Innovation Projects and Scale Hubs: Two Successful, Mutually Beneficial Approaches to Innovation\n\nE.ON's central innovation projects are initiated in response to specific challenges and requests from its units. The central Innovation division alone managed 117 innovation projects in 2023. It also launched 76 new projects and handed 40 over to our units to be integrated into the operating business. The innovation projects handed over in 2023 alone currently promise an estimated \u20ac230 million in sales growth over the next five years.\n\nAn example of these innovations is an pilot project for dynamic pricing for public electric-vehicle charging that E.ON is currently conducting in Copenhagen. The Industry Innovations team is running another project called Zero.ON, which aims to help small and medium-sized enterprises record and quantify their carbon emissions.",

The purpose is to identify new business ideas and develop them further with the aim of scaling up the most promising projects. We call these business initiatives scale hubs. The Adeje Verde ('Green Adeje') and Evercharge projects are two such initiatives. Adeje Verde (Adeje, Tenerife) aims to make solar energy available to an entire energy community consisting of almost 200 households. Surplus solar energy is no longer simply fed into the network, but shared with neighbors within a 2-kilometer radius of the Adeje's solar farm.\n\nEvercharge helps E.ON expand its existing charging infrastructure while also lowering costs. Evercharge uses AI-based software that detects faults in the system before they are noticed by users or vehicles can no longer be charged. This predictive maintenance can shorten service times and reduce costs.\n\n## Management Control System\n\nOur big objective is for E.ON to be the sustainable platform for Europe's energy transition. In line with our guiding principle 'Making new energy work,' E.ON wants to be the driving force for change in the energy industry. The long-term and sustainable increase in shareholder value remains the focus of our strategy, which is geared toward sustainability, digitalization, and growth.\n\nA uniform Group-wide planning and controlling system is used for the value-based management of the Group as a whole and its individual businesses. This system forms the basis for a uniform mindset Group-wide, while at the same time allowing targeted steering impulses for individual business units.\n\n## E.ON's Management System\n\nEffective as of the 2022 financial year, adjusted EBITDA, investments, and earnings per share based on adjusted net income ('EPS') have been the most significant indicators for managing our\n\naspired growth. The use of additional key financial and nonfinancial performance indicators is intended to ensure that our growth is in line with the various interests of our stakeholders and enable a holistic view of our performance. In particular, we focus on our customers, employees, shareholders, and bondholders, always in line with our environmental, social, and governmental responsibility as a leading international energy company. Including key non-financial indicators explicitly anchors sustainability indicators in particular in the ongoing management of our businesses.\n\nThe following chart summarizes the key performance indicators used for management purposes.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn addition to the management system, the compensation system for the Management Board is also designed to support the implementation of our strategy and thus the long-term success of E.ON through the sustainable, long-term, and value-oriented management of the Group. For this reason, the compensation of the members of the Management Board has also been linked to the development of selected key performance indicators. The new Management Board compensation system has been in place since January 2022.\n\n## Most Significant Key Performance Indicators\n\nWith our focus on long-term, sustainable, and value-oriented growth, the most significant key performance indicators are the main metrics for internal management and the assessment of our business development and thus also the cornerstones of our forecast.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA is an earnings figure before interest income, income taxes, depreciation and amortization that has been adjusted to exclude non-operating effects. The adjustments include net book gains, certain restructuring expenses, the markto-market valuation of derivatives, and other non-operating earnings. Therefore, adjusted EBITDA is the indicator of sustainable earnings capacity and the appropriate key figure for determining the performance of our business.\n\nInvestments are equal to investments in property, plant, and equipment, intangible assets, and share investments shown in the E.ON Group's Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Investments are the engine for the future growth and digitalization of E.ON's business as well as decarbonization. As a reflection of our strategy, they therefore continue to be a key indicator for managing our activities.\n\nAdjusted earnings per share ('EPS') is equal to adjusted net income divided by the weighted average number of shares outstanding in the financial year. In addition to operating earnings, depreciation and amortization, interest income, tax and financial",

This allows a holistic assessment of the earnings situation from the perspective of the shareholders of E.ON SE.\n\n## Significant Key Performance Indicators\n\nIn order to suitably take into account the interests of our stakeholders in addition to our focus on growth, our management system also includes other significant key performance indicators. As a customer-oriented company, the ability to acquire new customers and retain existing ones is crucial to our success. Net Promoter Score ('NPS') measures customers' willingness to recommend E.ON to a friend or colleague (the Customer Satisfaction chapter contains more information). The attractiveness of our Company for investors is reflected in total shareholder return ('TSR') and dividend per share ('DPS'), which is part of TSR.\n\nWe have made sustainability the core of our corporate strategy. In everything we do, we keep in mind the consequences of our actions. The progression of our carbon footprint (the Climate Protection chapter contains more information), the frequency of serious incidents and fatalities ('SIF') (the Occupational Health and Safety chapter contains more information), and the proportion of female managers are thus significant key performance indicators and part of our management system. In addition, our ESG ratings are incorporated into our management system. This provides a comprehensive assessment of our actions with respect to environmental, social, and governance matters.\n\nSolid financing of our business activities is of great importance to realize our aspired long-term and sustainable growth in line with the fulfillment of our financial ambitions. For this reason, cashconversion rate, which is an indicator of E.ON's ability to transform operating earnings into cash inflows, and debt factor, which is a proxy for our capital structure and ratings, are significant key figures in our management system. In addition, ROCE is included in\n\nthe management system as a key performance indicator to assess the efficiency of capital employed.\n\n## Other Key Performance Indicators\n\nAlongside the performance indicators described above, other financial and non-financial indicators play a role in the success of our business and our corporate responsibility. Operating cash flow, power and gas wheeling volumes, sales volume, as well as selected employee-related information are examples of other key performance indicators.",

The use of fossil energy results in the emission of greenhouse gases ('GHG'). Renewable and low-carbon energy generation along with efficient energy use play a key role in reducing emissions and thus limiting global warming. The current geopolitical challenges to securing Europe's energy supply are not making this demanding task any easier. The transition to a low-carbon economy thus requires more joint efforts by all energy producers and consumers. This transition period poses a challenge to energy suppliers' competitiveness. But it also offers an opportunity to expand their business. Many countries, communities, and companies are already focusing on climate-friendly energy generation and energy-efficiency measures to achieve their carbon-reduction targets. E.ON's strategic focus on customer solutions for the efficient use of energy and smart energy networks fully aligns its business model with these global trends.\n\n## E.ON's Approach\n\nDistribution networks like E.ON's are the platform of the energy transition: they integrate renewables, connect producers and consumers, and manage complex energy flows in line with demand. Our solutions help customers of all kinds use energy more efficiently, produce their own renewable or low-carbon energy, and thus reduce their carbon footprint. In short, climate protection is an integral part of E.ON's business model. Our business activities help combat climate change, improve people's lives, and create a future worth living. For example, we support companies and communities in reducing their carbon emissions and expanding their eMobility charging infrastructure.\n\nE.ON wants to reduce the size of its environmental footprint as well. Since 2004, the Company has disclosed the annual carbon emissions from its power and heat generation and from other business activities not directly related to generation. These include upstream and downstream emissions associated with E.ON's business activities. E.ON calculates emissions using the globally recognized Greenhouse Gas Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard ('GHG Protocol') issued by the World Resources Institute ('WRI') and the World Business Council for Sustainable Development ('WBCSD'). The E.ON Management Board updated the Company's climate targets in 2020. To achieve them, we have defined specific actions to reduce our emissions in all three scopes of the GHG Protocol (see 'Goals and Performance Review' below). We use the Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting and Reporting Standard to compile our Scope 3 emissions. In addition, E.ON has included the achievement of its climate targets (Scope 1 and 2) in the Management Board's compensation system by means of the E.ON Sustainability Index. The purpose is to further embed ESG aspects like reducing carbon emissions into how E.ON runs its business.\n\n## Guidelines and Policies\n\nIn October 2021 E.ON revised its Health, Safety, Environment and Climate Protection Policy Statement. It clarifies that environmental and climate protection, just as occupational health and safety, are integral to E.ON's business operations. E.ON considers environmental and climate protection important and integral management tasks. The policy statement obligates E.ON to consider environmental and climate protection in all business decisions. E.ON's promise to use the best-possible technologies and procedures in its business processes will reduce its environmental impact and enhance its energy efficiency. In addition, it commits E.ON to comply with all health, safety, and environment ('HSE') laws and regulations and defines the appropriate management systems for this (ISO 45001, ISO 14001, and ISO 50001).\n\nIn addition, in late 2021 E.ON adopted an Environmental Protection Guideline. Information about it can be found in the Environmental Management chapter.\n\nTwo other HSE policies that are more specific in nature-the HSE Function Policy and the HSE People Guideline-took effect back at the beginning of 2018. The Function Policy defines HSE roles, responsibilities, management approaches and tools, and minimum requirements for the entire organization. It empowers the HSE division to monitor our units' compliance with the obligation to have an environmental management system certified to ISO 14001 or the Eco-Management Audit Scheme ('EMAS'). In addition, the Function Policy defines HSE standards for incident management. It thus replaces and updates the standards stipulated in previous company policies. The HSE People Guideline goes into greater detail, underlining the importance of environmental and climate protection and defining specific tasks. Our Code of Conduct contains general HSE rules with which all employees must comply.\n\n## Organization and Responsibilities\n\nThe Group's Sustainability department took the lead in developing the Group-wide climate targets. It also monitors progress toward them (see 'Goals and Performance Review' below). The units are supported in their decarbonization efforts by their HSE team and our wider HSE organization, which helps design energy-efficiency measures and shares ideas and best practices. This setup has enabled E.ON to make progress toward its company-wide reduction targets for direct and indirect emissions since the targets were adopted.\n\nE.ON has systematized the management of climate-related risks as well. In 2020 we further embedded climate-risk reporting into Group-wide risk management. More information can be found in the Risks and Chances Report. In addition, our reporting is guided by the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures ('TCFD'). An overview of the disclosures can",

The focus is on efficient collaboration between the Management Board and the Supervisory Board, transparent disclosures, and appropriate risk management. The clear organization of sustainability and climate activities ensures that everyone involved works together efficiently and that we continually improve our performance. Information about E.ON's progress toward its climate targets is first presented to the Chief Sustainability Officer, who is also Chief Executive Officer, and the Sustainability Council. The Chief Sustainability Officer, who chairs the council, reports to the E.ON Management Board about the progress achieved on a regular basis. The council met four times in 2023.\n\n## Specific Actions\n\nE.ON has had an ESG Reporting Manual since 2021. The manual's detailed descriptions and requirements instruct the units how to compile and report ESG key performance indicators ('KPIs'). E.ON then used the manual's climate-related KPIs to develop a Groupwide carbon management plan that breaks down the Group-wide climate targets to the business units. Its purpose is to measure progress toward these targets separately for each of E.ON's business units, factoring in the characteristics of their particular business, their strategic ambitions, and the climate policies of the country or countries where they operate. The plan reflects E.ON's general management approach: the Group sets the strategic course and governance framework, while the units have broad operational decision-making authority. The carbon management plan took effect in the third quarter of 2022.\n\nCDP is one of the largest international associations of investors that independently assess the transparency and quality of companies' climate reporting. E.ON has reported data on its carbon emissions to CDP since 2004. In 2023 CDP again gave E.ON an A rating for tackling climate change: this rating recognizes the Company's leading role in climate protection. E.ON is therefore among the best 346 that in 2023 achieved an A rating out of nearly 21,000 that were assessed. According to CDP, E.ON's demonstrable actions have made it one of the world's leading companies in environmental ambition, action, and transparency. In addition, for the 2022 assessment period (published in 2023) CDP recognized E.ON once more as a Supplier Engagement Leader.\n\nUnder E.ON's holistic climate strategy, decarbonization measures follow a clear hierarchy: avoidance and reduction of emissions have the highest priority. E.ON primarily uses emissions certificates to offset those emissions that are currently unavoidable. All of E.ON's offsets by means of certificates are completely voluntary and in addition to our climate targets.\n\nThe Company funds measures to avoid or eliminate emissions outside its own value chain by means of offsets and corresponding emissions certificates. The associated projects are often located in developing and emerging countries. E.ON uses emissions certificates to offset emissions at the product level and does not factor the amounts offset into its own carbon footprint or the KPIs collected for its own climate targets.\n\nAt the same time, we are aware that carbon offsets will play a role in reducing emissions in the long term. The process can be used to offset a small portion of remaining emissions. Voluntary carbon markets and the purchase of highly reputable certificates are becoming even more important. That is why E.ON developed a comprehensive strategy for offsetting carbon dioxide emissions from 2021 onward.\n\n\u203a More details on our carbon offset strategy are described in the publication entitled 'On course for net-zero-Supporting paper for E.ON's decarbonization strategy and climate-related disclosures.' \u2039\n\nA key element of this strategy is E.ON's partnership with the LEAF Coalition, which has been in place since 2021. LEAF, which stands for 'Lowering Emissions by Accelerating Forest finance,' is the largest private-public initiative against the deforestation of tropical rainforests. Participants include the Norwegian, British, American, and South Korean governments and more than 20 companies. LEAF's offset certificates aim to finance the protection of these forests and to support sustainable management approaches that closely involve policymakers and local stakeholders.\n\n## Goals and Performance Review\n\nOur strategic transformation from a traditional energy supplier to a focused operator of energy networks and energy infrastructure and to a provider of innovative customer solutions has led to a reorientation of our efforts to reduce both our direct and indirect emissions. In 2020 the E.ON Management Board therefore set new climate targets that are explained below. In parallel, the Company developed KPIs that are relevant for management control purposes; they are used, among other purposes, to calculate the long-term compensation for Management Board members.\n\nIn May 2022 the Science Based Target initiative ('SBTi') confirmed that E.ON's climate targets are consistent with the Paris Agreement's 1.5\u00b0C target. This means that E.ON's planned emissions reductions contribute to limiting global warming to 1.5\u00b0C relative to preindustrial levels. To achieve this, we plan to reduce our Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions by at least 50 percent by 2030 relative to a 2019 baseline.\n\n\u203a E.ON's SBTi targets are explained in more detail in our publication 'On course for net-zero-Supporting paper for E.ON's decarbonization strategy and climate-related disclosures.' \u2039",

On the one hand, E.ON intends, by reducing its own GHG emissions, to become climate-neutral by 2040; our reduction path for our Scope 1 and 2 emissions therefore foresees reducing these emissions by 75 percent by 2030 and by 100 percent by 2040. On the other hand, we aim to reduce our Scope 3 emissions by 50 percent by 2030 and by 100 percent by 2050. Both reduction paths are relative to a 2019 baseline. Scope 3 emissions occur primarily during the generation of the power E.ON purchases and resells and during the use of the gas E.ON sells. They account for most of E.ON's Group-wide carbon footprint.\n\nThe adoption of our climate strategy initiated actions to help us achieve the aforementioned climate targets for 2030, 2040, and 2050 and thus to support Europe's energy transition. E.ON systematically monitors its progress toward these targets. It is important to remember that year-on-year comparisons of energy consumption can be affected by temporary fluctuations caused by weather patterns and other factors. A period of several years is necessary to determine whether E.ON's actions are effective and where we stand with regard to our targets. Since 2016 we therefore assess the trend in more detail every three years. The trend indicated that so far the reduction rate is in line with the forecasts. Along with the adoption of the aforementioned carbon management plan in 2022 we refined this process by setting reduction rates for our individual business units as well. The units have to conduct controls on an annual basis so that we can see more exactly whether we are making progress along the prescribed path. In addition, each unit has the authority to pursue its own reduction targets that go beyond the target for E.ON as a whole.\n\n## Progress and Measures\n\n## Carbon Reporting According to the GHG Protocol\n\nE.ON calculates its emissions using the globally recognized WRI/WBCSD GHG Protocol for the seven GHGs covered by the Kyoto Protocol: carbon dioxide ('CO2'), methane ('CH4'), nitrous oxide ('N2O'), hydrofluorocarbons ('HFCs'), perfluorocarbons ('PFCs'), sulfur hexafluoride ('SF6') and also nitrogen trifluoride ('NF3'). CO2 is by far our biggest GHG. Other GHGs like SF6 and CH4 contribute to E.ON's climate impact. But they account for a\n\nmuch smaller share of our GHG emissions than CO2. The Global Warming Potential ('GWP') indicates how much GHGs affect global warming over a period of time compared with CO2. All GHG emissions can be expressed as CO2 equivalents ('CO2e') and therefore be accounted together.\n\nThe GHG Protocol defines three scopes (Scopes 1 to 3) for GHG accounting and reporting. This improves transparency and provides guidance for different types of climate policies and business objectives.\n\n<!-- image -->",

They also include fugitive methane emissions from our gas distribution networks.\n\nScope 2 are indirect GHG emissions from the generation of electricity that the Company purchases to power its buildings, operations, and electric vehicles or that is classified as network losses in its power distribution networks. These emissions do not physically occur at E.ON's facilities but rather at the facility where the electricity is generated. This is why power distribution losses are classified as Scope 2 emissions but gas distribution losses as Scope 1 emissions. Emissions attributable to network losses are lower in grid segments with lots of renewables feed-in. In line with the GHG Protocol, we calculate Scope 2 emissions using a location-based method and a market-based method. For its own management decision-making, E.ON uses the figure determined by the location-based method, which is based on the respective national generation mix. The market-based method yields a different figure because it is based on the contractually attributable generation mix of the Company's electricity suppliers. However, the effort required to identify every single provider that feeds electricity into each of E.ON's networks would be considerable. We therefore use the emission factor of each country's residual generation mix. In most cases, this factor is significantly higher than the factor of the national generation mix. Network losses accounted for approximately 3 percent of the power E.ON distributed in 2023.\n\nScope 3 are indirect emissions that occur upstream and downstream along E.ON's value chain. They result primarily from the generation of the electricity the Company purchases and resells to its customers and the use of the gas sold to them.\n\nScope 3 also includes the emissions attributable to the production and use of the goods and services E.ON purchases. In line with the GHG Protocol, since 2020 we have divided our emissions from power and heat generation into emissions from 'plants owned and operated' (Scope 1) and 'plants owned but leased to and operated by lessee' (Scope 3) for increased transparency.\n\nSince E.ON removed large-scale fossil-fueled power generation from its generation portfolio, it has procured power mainly from wholesale markets where the source of generation is often not traceable or information about the source is not reliable. When primary data are unavailable or of insufficient quality, the GHG Protocol recommends calculating emissions by using secondary data, such as industry-average data or government statistics. We therefore calculate the Scope 3 emissions from the generation of this power by using the official national emission factors of the countries in which we purchase power resold to end-customers.\n\nFurthermore, we also use market-based methods to calculate the emissions of power resold to end-customers. The Company can actively influence this figure by selling green power. This figure is therefore relevant for management control purposes.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur direct and indirect CO2e emissions totaled 70.70 million metric tons in 2023; of these, 3 percent were direct Scope 1 emissions, and 97 percent were indirect Scope 2 and 3 emissions. Scope 1 emissions decreased by 30 percent compared with the previous year, indirect emissions by around 20 percent. The emissions figures relevant for management control purposes were used for these calculations: location-based Scope 2 emissions and market-based Scope 3 emissions.",

They were thus significantly lower than the prioryear figure of 2.88 million metric tons of CO2e. The decrease is mainly attributable to the fact that our CH4 tool, whose rollout was completed in 2023, gives us a more accurate method of calculating fugitive emissions in our gas distribution networks. This method's adoption Group-wide ensures the comparability of fugitive CH4 emissions.\n\nEmissions from power and heat generation were primarily due to our distributed combined heat and power ('CHP') plants. Our disclosure of Scope 1 emissions from power and heat generation at leased plants has been more transparent since 2020. We report emissions from downstream plants leased by us as Scope 3 emissions. These are plants that we installed at customers' premises and that they operate as lessees for their own needs. For heat, 61 percent of emissions come from owned generation plants and 39 percent from leased plants. For power, 38 percent of emissions come from owned power plants and 62 percent from leased plants.\n\nFugitive emissions at E.ON consist predominantly of methane (CH4) from leaks in gas infrastructure as well as leaks of sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) and coolants used in energy distribution equipment.\n\n## Scope 1 GRI 305-1\n\n| Total CO\u2082 equivalents in million metric tons 1   | 2023    | 2022    | 2021    |\n|--------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|---------|\n| Power and heat generation 2, 3                   | 1.87  4 | 1.90  5 | 2.17  6 |\n| Fugitive emissions                               | 0.05  7 | 0.89  8 | 1.44  8 |\n| Company-owned vehicles                           | 0.05    | 0.05    | 0.04    |\n| Fuels combustion 9                               | 0.05    | 0.05    | 0.05    |\n| Total                                            | 2.01    | 2.88    | 3.71    |\n\n1 The external GWP sources used are the BEIS, formerly DEFRA, the Naturv\u00e5rdsverkets, the GHG Protocol, the \u00d6verenskommelse V\u00e4rmemarknadskommitt\u00e9n 2022, and the IPCC AR5 report.\n\n2 In accordance with the GHG Protocol, emissions from power and heat generation are divided into emissions from plants owned and operated by E.ON (Scope 1) and emissions from plants leased to, and operated by, customers (Scope 3).

The higher figure compared with the previous year resulted from the less green generation mix in our markets. We reduced power transmission and distribution losses and power procured externally for our own needs in absolute terms.\n\nE.ON's investments to maintain its networks help reduce network losses as well. E.ON's approach depends on the type of loss. Technical losses can be reduced through network optimization. For this purpose, we are upgrading our networks using smart-grid technology (more information can be found in the Security of Supply chapter). This enables the lines and transformers to adaptin many cases automatically-to the actual production and consumption in a given grid segment. However, technical losses can only be reduced to a certain extent owing to the physical attributes of power grids. Alongside technical losses there are also commercial losses, which result primarily from theft.\n\n## Scope 2 GRI 305-2\n\n| Total CO\u2082 equivalents in million metric tons 1   |   2023 |   2022 |   2021 |\n|--------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Power distribution losses (location-based) 2     |   3.19 |   3.14 |   3.67 |\n| Power distribution losses (market-based) 3, 4    |   5.85 |   5.52 |   5.56 |\n| Purchased power (location-based)                 |   0.27 |   0.25 |   0.23 |\n| Purchased power (market-based)                   |   0.32 |   0.31 |   0.17 |\n| Total (location-based)                           |   3.46 |   3.38 |   3.9  |\n| Total (market-based)                             |   6.17 |   5.83 |   5.73 |\n\n1 The external global warming potential ('GWP') sources used are the International Energy Agency ('IEA') and the Association of Issuing Bodies ('AIB').\n\n3 Based on the emission factors of the national residual mixes for specific geographic regions.

We recorded a significant reduction of over 10 percent year on year, mainly because of the electricity and gas we sell to end-customers.\n\nThe factors again were portfolio streamlining as part of our B2B strategy, mild weather, and crisis-driven energy conservation. The market-based figure for power resold to end-customers declined even more-by more than 17 million tons of CO2e-relative to the prior year.

The focus of environmental management, however, has shifted significantly over the past eight years. The transformation into the new E.ON-a specialist for infrastructure and customer solutions to decarbonize the energy worldsubstantially changed E.ON's asset portfolio and environmental footprint. E.ON operates distribution networks in various European countries. Environmental management therefore places particular emphasis on protecting and promoting natural habitats and the diversity of ecosystems and species in the vicinity of this network equipment. Furthermore, we aim to address primarily these environmental aspects: conserving wastewater, water and other resources, reducing emissions, and generating less waste at our facilities and offices as well as complying with all international and national environmental laws and regulations at all times.\n\n## E.ON's Approach\n\nE.ON's environmental management is guided by the precautionary principle endorsed by the United Nations, and E.ON has explicitly supported the UN Global Compact's ten principles since 2005. In addition, E.ON is working to define its own environmental standards, such as ecological corridor management (see 'Specific Actions' below for more information), in order to set a strategic course for the entire Group and to guide the units' environmental protection activities.\n\nWe developed an Environmental Protection Guideline in late 2021 that describes E.ON's holistic approach to environmental protection. It was published in the first quarter of 2022 and contains the following five commitments: 'We care for ecosystems,' 'We steer our organization toward ecosystem protection,' 'We maximize our impact,' 'We set clear targets,' and 'We engage for environmental protection.'\n\nWe use our energy management system to continually look for opportunities to optimize the Group's energy consumption and the energy efficiency of our processes. It enables us to reduce greenhouse gas ('GHG') emissions and thus also plays an important role in environmental management, which is a key component of E.ON's operational health, safety, and environmental ('HSE') management. Combining these topics underscores that E.ON is equally committed to protecting people and the environment. In addition, bringing together health and safety, environmental, and energy management in a joint HSE organization enables us to leverage synergies because the approaches and systems are fundamentally similar.\n\nE.ON only wants to do business with companies that share its commitment to environmental protection. Consequently, we strive for our suppliers and contractors to comply with our environmental standards, and our HSE Policy stipulates that they must have a certified environmental management system in place.\n\n## Guidelines and Policies\n\n## Environmental Management Systems\n\nAll E.ON units-except for very small units and those with nonmaterial environmental risks-strive to have an environmental management system that is certified to ISO 14001 or validated by means of the Eco-Management and Audit Scheme ('EMAS').\n\n\u203a At year-end 2023, 85 percent of E.ON employees worked in business units that met this requirement. \u2039\n\nE.ON uses the environmental management system it has deployed (ISO 14001) to identify relevant environmental aspects and to evaluate the resulting opportunities and risks. The aim is for the Group to minimize and/or continually reduce its impact on the environment.\n\n## Energy Management Systems ('EnMS')\n\nISO 50001 is an international standard whose purpose is to enable organizations to continually improve their energy efficiency.\n\nIn accordance with the German Energy Services Act (German abbreviation: 'EDL-G'), E.ON has also introduced ISO 50001 certification in units that already have an HSE management system.\n\n\u203a At year-end 2023, 73 percent of E.ON employees worked in business units with ISO 50001 certification. \u2039\n\nE.ON measures and analyzes the energy use of facilities, vehicle fleets, and buildings at all of these units. The data help us identify opportunities for energy conservation and take cost-effective measures to improve energy efficiency. All units without ISO 50001 certification conduct energy audits in accordance with DIN EN 16247 under the EDL-G in Germany and analogous legislation in other European countries (more information on measures and guidelines can be found in the chapters entitled Climate Protection and Occupational Health and Safety).\n\nAs part of the EnMS, the energy team of E.ON companies in Germany and other countries sets annual targets and conducts systematic audits to monitor the effectiveness of the measures taken to achieve them. It also conducts an annual management review, which is audited by an accredited certification organization. These mechanisms confirmed the EnMS's effectiveness.\n\n## Organization and Responsibilities\n\nThe Group's Sustainability department played a leading role in developing company-wide climate protection targets and has since then been monitoring progress toward them. E.ON's units are responsible for taking steps to reduce their emissions, those caused by their business activities, and other environmental impacts. They are supported in these efforts by their Sustainability and HSE teams and our wider HSE organization, which, for",

The Climate Protection chapter contains information on E.ON's new carbon management plan.\n\nThe E.ON Environmental Network ('EEN') is a forum for sharing information about business-related environmental issues, environmental management, sustainability, and related law. The EEN brings together experts from the Energy Networks and Customer Solutions segments and the HSE and Sustainability teams. They work together closely in the EEN, which meets on a quarterly basis, usually virtually. Since the EEN was founded, its reach in the Group has extended continually. In addition to the issues addressed in 2021-commercial waste, ISO 14001 environmental assessment, and networking of biodiversity and environmental protection projects-one of the steps the EEN took in 2022 was to create a working group for the Federal Soil Protection and Contaminated Sites Ordinance and the new Substitute Building Materials Ordinance. It addresses the requirements that our business units must meet as a result of the sites ordinance's amendment and the new materials ordinance. E.ON also has an international EEN, which brings together E.ON colleagues outside Germany. Both forums met several times in 2023. We intend to expand these networks in the years ahead and transform them into Group-wide information-sharing platforms.\n\n## Specific Actions\n\nE.ON employees and managers are required to report environmental incidents. They use an IT application called PRISMA (Platform for Reporting on Incident and Sustainability Management and Audits) for this purpose (the Occupational Health and Safety chapter contains more information on PRISMA and E.ON's incident management).\n\n## Energy Management\n\nE.ON has taken several steps to improve the energy efficiency of its facilities in Germany. Its heat supply companies implement measures to optimize their networks. Its gas and power network companies conduct measures to improve the energy efficiency of\n\nnetwork equipment. Other steps include installing sensorcontrolled LED lighting in buildings and parking garages and reducing the energy consumption of ventilation and airconditioning systems. We also adjust the heat in our buildings to demand (the Energy Affordability chapter contains more information about energy conservation).\n\n## eMobility\n\nIn 2017 E.ON began offering its employees in Germany incentives to embrace eMobility. They include discounted leasing contracts for electric vehicles ('EVs'), at-home charging points, and certified renewable power tariffs, which enable employees to charge their EVs with clean energy. E.ON's Car Policy for the procurement of company cars and leased vehicles unambiguously supports the use of all-electric and hybrid vehicles. More information on our eMobility efforts can be found in the Sustainable Products and Services chapter.\n\n## Environmental Impact Assessments\n\nFor projects to build new power lines, gas pipelines, and other large industrial facilities with a foreseeable environmental impact, E.ON conducts an environmental impact assessment during the development phase to obtain construction and operating permits. We also frequently monitor a facility's operation to verify that the initial assessment was correct. In addition, E.ON maintains an ongoing dialogue with local stakeholders and interested parties on numerous environmental issues.\n\n## Biodiversity\n\nIn 2022 E.ON analyzed the extent to which its business model impacts biodiversity. The analysis took into account the frameworks of the Science Based Targets Network ('SBTN') and the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures ('TNFD'). The findings are divided into the dependencies of E.ON's business activities on ecosystem services and these activities' impacts on ecosystem services. E.ON's highest dependency on ecosystem services is hydroelectricity. The most important ecosystem services for E.ON's overall business are flood and storm protection.\n\nThe production processes with the highest impact are energy from biomass, hydropower, and heat plants. We continue to view our powerline corridors as a significant lever for enhancing biodiversity and are using ecological corridor management to address it.\n\nE.ON wants to use the findings to develop additional measures to further promote biodiversity in its business. A follow-up project was launched for this purpose in 2023. It is analyzing what measures will enable E.ON to improve its impact on biodiversity.\n\nE.ON's business units are already implementing local biodiversity measures. For example, LEW Wasserkraft, our hydropower subsidiary, places a great emphasis on sustainability and biodiversity and promotes them in a wide variety of projects. These include irrigating riparian forests, creating gravel spawning grounds, and fashioning semi-natural riverbank structures.\n\nE.ON also takes steps to protect wildlife and landscapes and to promote biodiversity. Bird safety, for example, is an important issue for many E.ON distribution system operators ('DSOs'). Their activities in this area include installing nest platforms for storks, eagles, falcons, and other bird species. Many business units have also launched tree-planting projects. In addition, E.ON has set up a Group-wide digital platform for biodiversity and environmental protection projects to improve the visibility of the issue and the exchange of information about it.\n\nE.ON has developed an approach for ecological corridor management ('ECM') and introduced it Group-wide in 2023 as a standard for vegetation management in all areas under and near 110 kV high-voltage overhead power lines where ECM is potentially practicable. We intend to extend this approach to all of the Group's DSOs in Europe by 2029. ECM enables E.ON to make a significant contribution to creating and maintaining permanently stable biotopes and structures and to promoting species protection, biodiversity, and the interlinking of valuable biospheres. ECM encompasses mapping biotopes, designing biotope-specific management plans, and implementing these plans",

ECM is already in place for an area the size of roughly 8,500 hectares. Through 2029, we plan to invest a figure in the double-digit million range and to implement ECM along the 13,000 kilometers of our high-voltage lines, which is roughly the area of around 100,000 soccer fields. ECM was applied to 12 percent of relevant areas in 2023 (previous year: 8 percent). Our ECM approach has been acknowledged outside E.ON as well and received the Renewables Grid Initiative's ('RGI') 2023 Grid Award in the Environmental Protection category. RGI is an alliance of NGOs, transmission system operators, and distribution system operators from across Europe engaged in promoting the energy transition by means of fair, transparent, and sustainable grid development. The aim is to enable renewables growth to achieve full decarbonization in line with the Paris Agreement.\n\n## Waste Management and Circular Economy\n\nE.ON periodically compiles environmental key performance indicators for waste. At the start of 2023 we began to catalog, in a structured way, our activities relating to a circular economy and to develop a circular economy strategy. CE.ON, our circular economy project, consists of a cross-discipline team of employees draw from the Strategy and Purchasing departments to determine this issue's relevance for E.ON and design specific activities.\n\nExamples include the transformer and switchgear workshops at E.ON distribution system operators Westnetz and Bayernwerk. These workshops have been in operation for many years and will be an important element of the energy transition in the future. They refurbish large transformers and other components, thereby extending their service life and thus contributing to the achievement of various environmental targets. In 2024 E.ON plans to adopt a circular economy strategy, which will also cover waste issues.\n\n## Goals and Performance Review\n\nThe E.ON Management Board is informed about serious environmental incidents (category 3 in our Standard on Incident Management) by means of monthly reports from HSE and periodic\n\nconsultations with the Senior Vice President for HSE. In the case of a major incident (category 4), the unit at which it occurred reports it directly to the E.ON Management Board member responsible for the respective unit and to Group HSE within 24 hours.\n\n## Progress and Measures\n\n\uf0d0\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Energy Consumption within the Organization\n\n## GRI 302-1\n\nE.ON consumed 49 million GJ of energy in 2023, 4 million GJ less than in the prior year (2022: 53 million GJ).\n\n## Savings Delivered by Emissions-reduction Projects\n\nE.ON regularly carries out projects to reduce its own GHG emissions. In 2023 these projects delivered over 18,000 metric tons of CO\u2082e savings. The measures to achieve them included upgrading the boilers in the plants of our district heating business, converting from natural to green gas, and reducing pipeline pressure in our gas networks prior to construction or maintenance in order to prevent fugitive methane emissions.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Circular Economy, Waste Avoidance, and Recycling\n\nE.ON always tries to avoid creating waste and, when this is not feasible, to recover as much of it as possible. If neither avoidance nor recovery is possible, we ensure, in accordance with legal requirements, that waste is disposed of correctly and responsibly. E.ON's operating business generates hazardous and nonhazardous waste, as does the retirement of some assets, such as the dismantling of the Company's nuclear power plants ('NPPs') in Germany.\n\n## Non-hazardous Waste\n\n| Metric kilotons     |   2023 |   2022 |   2021 |\n|---------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Non-hazardous waste |  496.1 |  381.3 |  428   |\n| Recovered           |  467   |  364.1 |  410.1 |\n| Disposed            |   29.1 |   17.3 |   17.9 |\n\nE.ON's total amount of non-hazardous waste increased from 381.3 metric kilotons in 2022 to 496.1 metric kilotons in 2023. There was an increase in 2023 that was attributable to an expansion of the companies reporting. The figures' comparability is therefore limited. E.ON recycled 94 percent of its non-hazardous waste.\n\n## Hazardous Waste\n\n| Metric kilotons   |   2023 |   2022 |   2021 |\n|-------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Hazardous waste   |  205.4 |  162.2 |  141.3 |\n| Recovered         |  170.7 |  107.5 |  106.7 |\n| Disposed          |   34.7 |   54.7 |   34.5 |\n\nE.ON produced 205.4 metric kilotons of hazardous waste in 2023, about 43 metric kilotons more than in 2022. The year-on-year rise was likewise caused by an expansion of the companies reporting, which limits the figures' comparability. Of this, 83 percent was recycled.",

This type of power generation is no longer a core E.ON business. It is therefore no longer considered a core KPI. E.ON now focuses on small-scale, embedded generation units. NOX, SO2, and dust emissions result mainly from small gas-fired CHP plants and larger plants for district heating networks. The year-on-year rise in NOX and SO2 emissions is mainly attributable to an expansion of the companies reporting and to higher plant utilization.\n\n## Responsible Water Management\n\nWater is a vital resource that is becoming increasingly scarce in some parts of the world. Many companies are therefore placing greater emphasis on identifying and managing water risks at their operations and along their supply chains. The same is true for investors and their portfolios. E.ON's water-related activities relate to the following areas: the withdrawal of cooling water for the NPP operated by PEL which in 2023 took place for the last time (for more information, see Water Management at PreussenElektra) and the withdrawal of fresh water by E.ON's water utility subsidiaries RWW and Avacon Wasser as well as a small amount in conjunction with our decentralized heating business. In addition, LEW operates a number of small and medium-sized run-of-river power plants in Germany with an installed capacity of 0.5 to 12 MW per plant, which only accounts for a small share of E.ON's electricity generation. The water supply companies RWW and Avacon Wasser as well as LEW are part of E.ON's portfolio.\n\n## Generation\n\n| Million cubic meters    | 2023   | 2022   | 2021   |\n|-------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Fresh water consumption | < 1    | < 1    | < 1    |\n\nRWW and Avacon Wasser supply about 970,000 people, industrial enterprises, and businesses in Lower Saxony, North Rhine-Westphalia, and Saxony-Anhalt with roughly 83 million cubic meters of water annually, of which 36.6 million cubic meters is groundwater, 46.4 million cubic meters surface water and 0.2 million cubic meters spring water.\n\nAccordingly, this business involves the extraction of water as a resource and its treatment as well as final distribution to endusers; it also includes the reuse of wastewater and thus the closing of the water cycle. Although water operations account for only a small proportion of the Group's total sales, we pay particular attention to the associated consequences from the perspective of resource conservation and supply security. We use two KPIs to assess the water utility business's risks: total withdrawal and distribution losses. Withdrawal is the amount of water supplied to end-users; that is, not water used in our own operations. The basis for a permanent supply of water is a climate with sufficient precipitation to allow surface and groundwater to reform. This can generally be anticipated in RWW's and Avacon Wasser's service regions. The regions' available surface water and groundwater reserves will secure drinking and process water requirements.\n\nBased on available data, E.ON assesses the current, and the possibility of future, water scarcity in the relevant regions in which E.ON uses fresh water for its activities to be generally low. Additional disclosures on E.ON's water withdrawal and risks areas can be found in the ESG Figures. The cessation of electricity generation at Isar 2 NPP in April 2023 means that E.ON no longer consumes cooling water to operate its facilities.\n\nWater and climate protection go hand in hand at E.ON's water utilities: we conduct a variety of projects to address both issues and are always looking for new, more environmentally compatible solutions for wastewater disposal, sewage sludge recycling, as well as service water and rainwater utilization. For example, we are designing plans for smart water use in new residential areas and working on flood-protection systems in municipalities. Conducting research and development projects enables us to investigate innovative solutions for qualitative and quantitative water protection, such as additional potential resources for irrigation.\n\nIn addition, RWW and Avacon Wasser provide information on the careful use of water as a resource. Important channels are the company websites and press releases. For example, during the summer months RWW gives its customers advice on the careful, appropriate use of fresh water. In addition, RWW has operated educational facilities-Aquarius and Haus Ruhrnatur-since 1992, in which visitors can learn about topics related to water supply and preventive water protection. Museum educators at the two educational facilities offer various lessons on water and environmental protection to schools in RWW's service territory.\n\n## E.ON's Water Consumption from Water Supply Operations\n\n| Infrastructure leakage index  (\"ILI\")   | 2023    | 2022   | 2021   |\n|-----------------------------------------|---------|--------|--------|\n| Factor                                  | \u2264 1.5 1 | \u2264 1.5  | \u2264 1.5  |\n\n1 Figures for 2023 are based on a preliminary estimate based on prior-year figures.\n\nInfrastructure leakage index ('ILI') enables water utilities to measure and compare water losses. ILI is a KPI for assessing water losses that is widely used and recognized internationally. ILI factors in not only the amount of water loss, but also the relevant parameters (such as pipeline system length and pressure). Unlike the KPI commonly used in Germany (specific actual water loss, or QVR), ILI offers better comparability with structurally similar companies and better guidance for a company's own water",

By international standards, E.ON's ILI of less than 1.5 puts it in the best leakage performance category of A (ILI \u22642).\n\nDrinking water reduction targets in our water utility business have to do with reducing leakages at water utility facilities. Pursuant to Technical Annex 5.1 of the EU taxonomy, E.ON has set a target of reaching and consistently maintaining an ILI of less than 1.5 (very efficient performance, target figure of low leakage). We intend to achieve this target by conducting targeted maintenance measures to minimize damage rates at water distribution facilities. In addition, continual network monitoring and water leakage analyses will make it possible to recognize damage at water distribution facilities early and to actively eliminate it. We measure the amount of water delivered to our customers by using metrologically highly efficient water meters and thus by minimizing metering errors.\n\n## Water Management at PreussenElektra\n\nThe NPP in Germany operated by our subsidiary PreussenElektra ('PEL') accounted for a significant share of E.ON's water consumption and used. Its NPPs use water for cooling and processes. PEL is committed to using water efficiently and sustainably and to maintaining high quality in the river from which its plants withdraw water. It also strove continually to use less. PEL observes all laws and regulations regarding water withdrawal and discharge. The most important law for PEL in this context is the Federal Water Act (Wasserhaushaltsgesetz, or 'WHG'). PEL protects aquatic flora and fauna by using mechanical purification processes instead of biocides and by constantly monitoring the temperature of discharge water. PEL also expects its contractors to use water sparingly and has binding water management provisions in its agreements with them.\n\n## PEL's Water Balance\n\n| Million cubic meters    |   2023 |   2022 | 2021   |\n|-------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Fresh water withdrawal  |    203 |    245 | 2,383  |\n| Fresh water discharge   |    191 |    216 | 2,331  |\n| Fresh water consumption |     13 |     29 | 53     |\n\nPEL withdrew 203.1 million cubic meters of freshwater in 2023, 40 million cubic meters less than in 2022. PEL used freshwater, which came almost exclusively from rivers, primarily as cooling water. Water consumption dropped sharply compared with the previous year because significantly less cooling water was needed after the shutdown of Isar 2 NPP in April 2023. The withdrawal of water not used for cooling declined as well. This is related to the progress of dismantling at Unterweser, Brokdorf, and Grohnde NPPs. PEL returned 93.8 percent of withdrawn water to its source.\n\n## Safe Handling of Radioactive Waste\n\nPEL is responsible for the safe and reliable operation and dismantling of its NPPs. Both activities result in radioactive waste. E.ON is well aware of the high responsibility that is associated with both.\n\nThe Law on the Reorganization of Responsibility in Nuclear Waste Disposal (Entsorgungs\u00fcbergangsgesetz, or 'Ents\u00dcG') and the contract to finance the costs of the nuclear energy phaseout between the German federal government and German NPP operators stipulate the division of responsibility for nuclear waste interim storage and final disposal and its financing.\n\nE.ON aims to minimize the amount as well as the volume of radioactive waste. We do this in part by separating it from uncontaminated waste and by subjecting it to certain treatments that reduce its volume. The nuclear industry distinguishes between radioactive waste that generates negligible heatlow-level waste ('LLW') and intermediate-level waste ('ILW')and waste that generates high heat: high-level waste ('HLW'):\n\n- \u00b7 LLW and ILW account for the largest amount of radioactive waste in terms of both weight and volume. Examples of LLW include protective clothing, cleaning equipment, tools, and building rubble from plant control areas. ILW includes, in particular, the reactor pressure vessel's near-core mounting parts. Together, both waste categories contain less than 1 percent of an NPP's total radioactivity.\n- \u00b7 HLW contains more than 99 percent of an NPP's total radioactivity and consists primarily of the fission products of uranium in the irradiated fuel assemblies.\n\nNPP operators are responsible for packaging LLW and ILW safely and according to approved standards. After regulatory certification, packaged LLW and ILW becomes the responsibility of the German federal government. The Law on the Reorganization of Responsibility in Nuclear Waste Disposal transferred the responsibility for operating defined storage facilities for LLW and ILW. Pursuant to this law, the German federal government is responsible for the storage of PEL's LLW and ILW effective January 1, 2020. This applies to the following PEL facilities: Stade NPP, W\u00fcrgassen transport staging hall, Grafenrheinfeld staging hall, Unterweser radioactive waste storage facility, and Unterweser storage facility. The Konrad repository for LLW and ILW is currently being built by BGE, the German Federal Company for Radioactive Waste Disposal. BGE expects Konrad to be commissioned in 2029.\n\nAll central tasks related to the handling and disposal of radioactive waste have been combined at PEL's Nuclear Waste Management department since July 1, 2023. This optimizes the on-schedule and efficient coordination of all strategically important aspects of nuclear waste disposal at PEL's fleet of NPPs undergoing dismantling. The head of Nuclear Waste Management reports directly to the PEL's CEO. Key objectives are to standardize and digitalize nuclear waste disposal and thus to optimize related processes and the quality-from waste generation and collection",

Under the Law on the Reorganization of Responsibility in Nuclear Waste Disposal, the interim storage facilities and containers of irradiated fuel assemblies became the property and responsibility of the German federal government effective January 1, 2019. Fuel assemblies will remain in the interim storage facilities until Germany has a state-owned receiving facility or repository for HLW. When this will happen is unclear. The responsibility for final disposal lies with the German federal government.\n\n## Radioactive waste\n\n| Metric tons                                   | 2023    | 2022    | 2021    |\n|-----------------------------------------------|---------|---------|---------|\n| Low and intermediate-level  radioactive waste | 1,374.1 | 1,105.7 | 1,420.2 |\n| High-level radioactive waste                  | 0.0     | 0.0     | 65.0    |\n\nFor 2023 PEL submitted notification for 268.4 metric tons more LLW and ILW than for 2022. The amount of waste is subject to fluctuations, depending on the NPPs' dismantling activities. As in the prior year, HLW amounted to 0 metric tons due to the decommissioning of NPPs. New fuel rods were installed in Isar 2 NPP-which continued to operate temporarily until April 15, 2023-for the last time in October 2021.\n\n## Sustainable Products and Services\n\n\uf098\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## GRI 3-3\n\nGreenhouse gas emissions cannot be limited only by the way energy is generated. Energy efficiency and other methods of reducing consumption as well as energy recovery can lower emissions, too. E.ON has a broad portfolio of such solutions, which it markets to residential customers and to industrial, commercial,\n\nand municipal customers. E.ON continually adjusts this portfolio to better meet its customers' needs, respond to market changes, and utilize new technologies.\n\n## E.ON's Approach\n\nE.ON offers distributed energy systems for households under the brand name Future Energy Home. Customers can use a variety of solutions: solar modules for generating their own energy and battery systems for storing it as well as charging stations for electric vehicles ('EVs'), heat pumps, and other heating solutions. The devices are connected to E.ON Home, an energy-management app; launched in 2018, it was available in six countries in the year under review. Regardless of where they are, customers can use the app to view their home's energy output and consumption, control their devices, and reduce their energy use and carbon emissions. E.ON added new functions to the app in 2023, particularly for electromobility ('eMobility'). The aim is to enable customers to conveniently and automatically charge their EV when energy is cheaper and greener. Other features that provide our customer with additional services for energy optimization and thus savings in smart charging and for improved use of stored solar power are planned for 2024 and are currently in the development and test phase.\n\nFor digital energy-management solutions to function seamlessly, smart energy meters are essential. An EU Directive from 2021 stipulates that, to the degree technically and financially feasible, all customers should have a smart energy meter. Member states must transpose this directive into national law. For example, Germany's Act on the Digitalization of the Energy Transition, which was amended in 2023, specifies that all customers must be equipped with a smart energy meter by 2032. More information can be found below under 'Goals and Performance Review.'\n\nAlso, eMobility will play a significant role in the energy transition. Germany's transport sector emitted around 148 million metric tons of CO\u2082 equivalents ('CO 2e') in 2021. The German Climate Protection Act, which was amended in 2021, calls for these\n\nemissions to be reduced to a maximum of 85 million metric tons of CO2e per year by 2030. To achieve this, passenger car and road freight transport must be climate-neutral and the range of alternative drivetrains and the infrastructure to supply them with energy must be massively expanded. One million publicly accessible charging points are to be installed in Germany alone by 2030. In addition, there will be charging points in eCar drivers' private and business environments and at the premises of EV fleet operators. E.ON's objective is to use its experience in the energy sector to enable EV charging in public places, at work, and at home.\n\nE.ON offers comprehensive infrastructure solutions to make charging both economical and climate-friendly. Under its E.ON Drive brand, E.ON plans and installs charging stations and connects them to the power grid. E.ON is also responsible for supplying energy and operating the equipment. Our eMobility business continues to focus on three areas: E.ON Drive Solutions serves private and business users. Its focus is on offerings for charging at work, on the go, and at home, which include a variety of charging stations as well as related installation and energy services. In addition, E.ON Drive eTransport is engaged in charging solutions for the electrification of commercial vehicles. E.ON Drive Infrastructure is a charge point operator ('CPO') and thus provides charging infrastructure in public places.\n\nDistributed, flexible, and connected supply systems are crucial for the future energy world. E.ON wants to propel their development with its Energy Infrastructure Solutions ('EIS') business. This business develops energy units to supply cities and communities as well as commercial and industrial customers with sustainable heat (steam), cooling, and electricity. Its portfolio includes district heating and cooling, distributed solutions for city districts and industrial and commercial customers as well as products and services for greater energy efficiency. EIS's offerings incorporate the latest technology, including large-scale heat pumps, combined-heat-and-power ('CHP') and energy-recovery plants as well as waste-heat recovery and low-temperature heating and",

Some solutions are complemented by softwarebased solutions and analytics that enable customers to reduce their energy consumption, costs, and greenhouse gas emissions by visualizing and optimizing their energy use.\n\n## Organization and Responsibilities\n\nOur Chief Operating Officer-Commercial, who is a member of the E.ON Management Board, has overall responsibility for the entire customer business, including the Customer Solutions segment. E.ON Energy Infrastructure Solutions ('EIS') and Business-toCustomer ('B2C') work with various E.ON business units on a wide range of topics, such as product development, plant operation, and sustainability management. Responsibility for this lies with the regional units for their respective market (including Western, Central, and Eastern Europe, the United Kingdom, and Scandinavia).\n\nE.ON's distribution system operators ('DSOs') across Europe, which are part of the Energy Networks segment, are responsible for installing smart energy meters in their service territories; the exception is the United Kingdom, where E.ON's retail organization provides them to its customers. German law created two roles for the provision of smart energy meters. The first role, the default metering provider, is responsible for the mass rollout of the standard smart energy meter mandated by German law. At E.ON, this role is performed by its DSOs. The second role, the competitive metering service provider, offers the standard smart energy meter as well as other metering solutions. At E.ON, this role is performed by its German retail sales unit. In addition, E.ON subsidiaries act as smart-meter service providers for municipal utilities and regional energy suppliers in Germany.\n\nOf E.ON's three business units active in eMobility, E.ON Drive Solutions plays a Group-wide role as a competence center for effective and attractive charging solutions. E.ON Drive Solutions is represented across Europe, and its task areas include sales, operations, and IT management.\n\n## Specific Actions\n\nE.ON Plus enables residential customers in Germany to bundle two or more energy contracts for power or gas and to benefit from 100 percent green power at no extra charge. By meeting certain conditions, they can receive an annual discount of \u20ac60 per contract. E.ON contracts throughout Germany are eligible. Moreover, customers can bundle their own contracts or participate in E.ON Plus with family members, friends, or neighbors.\n\nAs an eMobility provider ('EMP'), we give eCar drivers access to our charging network. This network also includes charging points from other providers that are available to E.ON customers as roaming options. In addition, we offer residential customers innovative charging stations and specific electricity tariffs. We supply our commercial customers with both regular and fast charging stations. Furthermore, we support them with solutions for EV fleet management.\n\nOn the commercial vehicle side, E.ON Drive aims to capitalize on growth in the market segments of electric road haulage and public passenger transport as well. Battery-powered commercial vehicles are still the exception, especially in the heavy-duty category. Unlike the passenger car market, the transportation sector is only at the beginning of its evolution toward zero-emission mobility. But interest among companies and municipalities in electrifying their truck, bus, and van fleets is growing. Climate targets, increasing freight transport, and the growth trajectory of electric drives in local and long-distance public transport will pose greater challenges for charging infrastructure, land use, and grid connections as well. E.ON wants to help fleet operators meet these challenges by significantly expanding its portfolio of products and services for charging fleets of electric commercial vehicles.\n\nEIS pursues a partnership-based business approach in developing integrated solutions for heating, cooling, electricity, and mobility. These holistic concepts that integrate the individual sectors-for example, electricity from photovoltaic systems can be used to\n\npower heat pumps and eMobility charging infrastructure. E.ON enters into long-term partnerships, such as the energy partnership it concluded with Messe Berlin for a sustainable supply of heat and cooling. By 2025, EIS will convert the trade fair ground's heat and cooling supply to climate-friendly technologies. Various heat sources will work together and thus yield significant energy, carbon, and cost savings and also ensure greater independence from individual energy sources.\n\nEIS customers increasingly link their sustainability targets to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals ('UN SDGs'), especially SDGs 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy), 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities), and 13 (Climate Action). EIS formed partnerships with municipal, industrial, and real estate customers across Europe in 2023 to support them in achieving their sustainability targets. By assisting them with development projects that have long-lasting effects, we also aim to help safeguard their assets' long-term value.\n\nE.ON continues to take part in research projects at universities and research institutions. The purpose is to develop the technologies, systems, and approaches that will make it possible to meet the needs of tomorrow's energy world. Our flagship partnership is with the E.ON Energy Research Center at RWTH Aachen University. Its research has an interdisciplinary approach and focuses mainly on distributed generation, smart grids, and efficient building technologies.\n\n## Goals and Performance Review\n\nE.ON wants to offer its customers pioneering energy solutions for the energy world of today and tomorrow. We want our solutions to help them save money, use less energy where possible, and emit less carbon dioxide. E.ON has set a target for this: by 2030, the Company aims to reduce customers' carbon dioxide emissions by 50 percent relative to 2016 (you can find out more about E.ON's climate targets in the Climate Protection chapter).",

However, regulatory delays in the certification of the communication units, known as smart energy meter gateways, prevented DSOs in Germany from starting to gradually rollout smart energy metering systems until February 2020. Until the responsible federal authority withdrew the market declaration in May 2022, the rollout of smart energy metering systems in Germany proceeded according to plan. Since then, it has continued on a reduced scale. A renewed ramp-up required an amended law that took effect in mid-2023.\n\nThe E.ON Drive Infrastructure team invests in, builds, and operates charging infrastructure at publicly accessible locations to support the development of a Europe-wide network. It aims to expand its network by 1,000 charging points per year and is focusing on three key use cases to achieve this target: in the immediate vicinity of densely populated residential areas, city centers, and attractions; in partnership with high-traffic destinations, such as supermarkets or hotels and restaurants; and along freeways.\n\nThe impact that EIS's projects in the industrial sector have on our customers' sustainability can be measured by a variety of KPIs. These KPIs range from carbon-emissions savings to reductions in energy costs and consumption including reductions in final energy consumption (such as electricity) as well as primary energy usage (for example, fuel consumption to generate electricity or heat). Due to country-specific standards and reporting obligations, however, these KPIs are not consistently consolidated Group-wide.\n\nDepending on the project and customer requirements, we also use a variety of KPIs to evaluate the effectiveness of EIS solutions for customers in the real estate and housing sector. These KPIs include primary energy consumption (such as the use of gas to generate heat), avoided emissions (typically CO2), and the deployment of renewable generation technologies (such as geothermal energy and heat pumps) in new property developments. Targets for these KPIs differ based on customer\n\ndemands and market standards. Teams from our regional units monitor these EIS projects on a regular basis.\n\n## Progress and Measures\n\n## Installed Smart Energy Meters by Country \uf09a\n\n| Thousand units    | 2023   | 2022   | 2021   |\n|-------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Rollout countries |        |        |        |\n| United Kingdom    | 5,830  | 5,300  | 4,738  |\n| Germany 1         | 5,824  | 4,874  | 3,112  |\n| Sweden            | 1,052  | 1,050  | 1,047  |\n| Pilot countries   |        |        |        |\n| Romania           | 451    | 346    | 306    |\n| Slovakia 2        | 0      | 105    | 100    |\n| Hungary           | 411    | 330    | 188    |\n| Czech Republic    | 25     | 10     | 5      |\n| Poland            | 211    | 163    | 158    |\n| Total             | 13,804 | 12,178 | 9,654  |\n\n1 Includes digital meters.\n\n2 The company VSEH operating in Slovakia was deconsolidated in the end of 2023.\n\n<!-- image -->",

This encompasses ensuring our employees' safety in the workplace, promoting their health, and also supporting their mental wellbeing. Many employees perform high-risk work, such as on energy networks, gas pipelines, and other industrial facilities. Stringent safety standards are therefore of particular importance to E.ON, because employees' health is E.ON's top priority.\n\n## E.ON's Approach\n\nHealth and safety ('H&S') have long been firmly embedded in E.ON's corporate culture and its organizational setup, policies, and procedures. E.ON's approach is proactive and preventive.\n\nWe are unambiguously committed to the principle of zero tolerance of accidents. E.ON's main objective is to prevent occupational accidents from the outset. This applies to E.ON employees as well as contractor employees who work on its behalf.\n\nE.ON's ambition is to extensively promote employees' well-being and enable them to maintain their performance and employability. In particular, we try to prevent those health conditions that most frequently result in incapacity for work. E.ON's health management includes designing and providing health services (such as flu vaccinations) as well as target-group-specific individual measures to maintain health in the different phases of employees' lives. It typically encompasses issues that are relevant for all employees or for certain target groups. Issues include general health maintenance, nutrition, exercise, mental health, stress management, and addiction prevention. E.ON promotes them by means of training sessions, information leaflets,\n\npresentations, and digital formats. Its use of the latter was again high due to hybrid work.\n\n## Guidelines and Policies\n\nE.ON is committed to a culture of prevention. We reaffirmed this in 2009 by signing the D\u00fcsseldorf Statement on the Seoul Declaration on Safety and Health at Work as well as the Luxembourg Declaration on Workplace Health Promotion.\n\nE.ON has had a Group Company Agreement on Health for all employees in Germany since 2015; it was last revised in 2018. Its purpose is to foster a healthy work environment and promote the health of all employees. It defines four action areas: occupational health management, addiction prevention and intervention, occupational integration management, and employee counseling.\n\nThe E.ON Health, Safety, Environment & Climate Protection Policy Statement, which was originally published in 2018, was updated in 2021 to reflect E.ON's Vision Zero for safety targets as well as its climate and environmental targets in the context of the EU taxonomy. In addition, we simplified the document's language and eliminated redundancies.\n\nA Group-wide standard for managing risks to health, safety, and the environment ('HSE') has applied in the Company since the start of 2021. It defines the minimum requirements for identifying, analyzing, evaluating, managing, and monitoring HSE and other sustainability-related dangers and opportunities. The standards' requirements are also supported by IT solutions, which are mainly used to create risk assessments and/or indices as well as activityrelated danger evaluations. Our employees have the opportunity to view danger evaluations relevant to them and the resulting protection measures.\n\nThe Group HSE Function Policy defines HSE roles, responsibilities, management expectations, and reporting channels. It sets minimum requirements and defines management tools needed to prevent physical and mental harm in the workplace. It also requires\n\nall our operating units (except for very small ones and those with insignificant risks and potential impact) to have in place an occupational H&S management system certified to international standards-such as ISO 45001 (which replaced OHSAS 18001)and to improve the system on an ongoing basis.\n\n\u203a At year-end 2023, 83 percent of our employees worked at business units certified to ISO 45001. \u2039\n\nE.ON refined the Group HSE Function Policy in 2022. For example, we added or sharpened the definition of tasks and task areas and formulations, in part to better integrate sustainability aspects Group-wide, including task areas such as the environment and biodiversity, sustainability reporting, and supply chain.\n\nIn addition, the People Guideline on HSE communicates E.ON's HSE aspirations and states the expectation that all employees embrace HSE on the job. It also describes E.ON's Safety F1RST principles for the safety mindset and behaviors necessary to prevent accidents. The guideline contains extra tasks for managers because their responsibilities include leading by example with regard to HSE.\n\nThe Group Standard for Incident Management, which applies to E.ON contractors as well, establishes consistent rules for classifying, investigating, analyzing, and reporting HSE incidents and for sharing information. It complements PRISMA (Platform for Reporting on Incident and Sustainability Management and Audits), E.ON's IT solution for incident management, which is described below under 'Specific Actions.'\n\nThe Group Standard on HSE Management Expectations, which took effect in 2022, defines expectations for 15 core elements. It addresses occupational safety and accident prevention as well as the safety of E.ON's technical facilities, products, and services over their entire life cycle, HSE in project management. The chapter entitled Data Protection, Cybersecurity, and Product Safety contains more information about product safety. This standard",

E.ON developed an Expectations Maturity Assessment Tool ('EMAT') to simplify implementation and assess the status of management systems and rolled it out in April 2023. The tool is a specification of the aforementioned Group Standard on HSE Management Expectations adopted in 2022. In addition, we opened and/or migrated two IT portals to support HSE compliance processes: Red-on-line (formerly known as Gutwin) for managing E.ON's legal obligations and eNorm for managing obligations from norms that E.ON must apply (such as Paragraph 49 of Germany's Energy Industry Act) and/or would like to apply (including, for example, ISO 45001 and ISO 50001).\n\nIn addition, the HSE division works closely with the Human Rights Center of Expertise and Group Compliance with regard to Germany's Supply Chain Due Diligence Act to monitor compliance with procurement policies and standards and to ensure adherence to E.ON's minimum standards for HSE. This collaboration likewise resulted in additional HSE issues being embedded in procurement processes, such as dealing with smaller suppliers. Harmonized minimum HSE requirements for contractors now apply at all E.ON companies in Germany; these requirements may be supplemented by additional requirements depending on the services the companies procure. The implementation of a Group-wide standard for contractor management continues at E.ON companies and their processes for contractor management are being adjusted accordingly. This new standard defines minimum requirements and roles and responsibilities to ensure the consistent management and evaluation of HSE issues and risks in the collaboration with contractors. E.ON companies must integrate the requirements into their processes by May 2024. They are supported by a catalogue of contractor management measures, which also serves as an assessment tool for the implementation of the standard.\n\nMore than 40 E.ON companies in Germany are now certified to ISO 45001 (occupational safety), ISO 14001 (environmental protection), and ISO 50001 (energy management) by means of a multisite process called E.ON Matrix Certification. Most of these companies are network companies and their subsidiaries, sales companies, and companies that offer integrated energy infrastructure solutions. This is another step to manage these companies in terms of occupational health and safety and environmental protection, to leverage synergies, and to harmonize processes.\n\n## Organization and Responsibilities\n\nE.ON is committed to protecting people and the environment. Because the approaches and systems for both are similar, E.ON combines environmental management and occupational H&S management in a single HSE organization. The E.ON Management Board and the management of our units are responsible for E.ON's HSE performance, which includes compliance as well as improvement. They set strategic targets and update policies to foster continuous improvement. They are supported and advised by the HSE department at Corporate Functions and the E.ON HSE Council. The council is composed of senior executives and employee representatives from different business areas and countries in which E.ON is active. It meets at least two times a year and is chaired by the member of the E.ON Management Board responsible for HSE. The second HSE Council meeting was rescheduled to January 2024 because of a change in division heads. E.ON units have their own HSE councils and expert teams as well. They define the HSE requirements for their unit and plans to implement them. Every unit must ensure that it meets E.ON's corporate and HSE standards, design and implement HSE plans according to local needs, and follow E.ON's HSE Strategy Roadmap for 2021-23.\n\nE.ON's International Health Experts team intensified its collaboration to foster health-related improvements and innovations and thus its health strategy. Since 2022 the team has\n\nagain been sharing knowledge and experience between countries to identify and leverage collaboration synergies.\n\n## Specific Actions\n\nThe HSE department oversees strategic H&S training sessions. This includes the training provided to the E.ON Group's top 100 executives, programs for senior managers in the operating business, and training for staff who conduct incident investigations (such as root-cause analysis). With regard to the Group HSE Strategy Roadmap, E.ON's units conduct their own operational H&S training, programs to enhance HSE culture, and training required by law.\n\nE.ON managers in Germany can enroll in Healthy Leadership, a training module on how to address health issues and thereby promote health in their team. This training continued to be conducted digitally in 2023 and covered issues such as psychological security in teams, stress reduction, mental health, and tips for an ergonomic workplace. E.ON employees in Germany had free access to online ergonomics advisors, including for their home office.\n\nIn addition, workshops for a common understanding of E.ON's caring culture were held for the top 100 executives and senior managers from operations and administration.\n\nFurthermore, training formats for employees and managers were revised in 2023. The findings of extensive use analyses (the employee survey and in-depth interviews with senior management) were used to make target-group-specific adjustments.\n\nTraining content given a sharper focus included psychological safety, communications, and appreciation. This was accompanied by an ambassador campaign in which selected top 100 personalities describe what caring culture means for their area of responsibility.",

This includes a constructive culture of failure as well. We thoroughly investigate incidents by conducting root-cause analyses ('RCA'). For this purpose, E.ON has introduced a specific Group standard and, in 2023, further expanded the related training and continuing skills development offerings. The training courses on offer cover topics such as investigation methods and communication. Lessons learned from incident investigations are shared throughout the Group and are incorporated into the units' activities and into working groups. E.ON also uses the lessons learned to institute preventive measures.\n\nPRISMA, an integrated IT solution, is the main component of E.ON's online incident management system and is used by all E.ON units. It enables us to reach many users, report and manage data, and ensure a high degree of transparency. Incident investigations are entered and stored directly in PRISMA, ensuring that all companies and Corporate Functions always work with the same database. Incident reporting is prompt, and the situation should be clear for everyone involved. All this is intended to help prevent incidents. E.ON has five categories of incidents. They range from 0 (low) to 4 (major). E.ON's HSE Standard on Incident Management requires the units to use PRISMA to report category 4 incidents to the HSE department at Corporate Functions within 24 hours; in addition, the units immediately forward the information to the Management Board. Employees must report all incidents, regardless of their severity, using PRISMA. No employee needs to fear any disadvantages. In addition, their personal data are always protected and can only be accessed by limited user groups. E.ON analyses all incidents. If employees or contractors who find themselves in a situation that they believe is potentially dangerous, they have clear instructions to suspend work immediately and, if necessary, leave the work area. They are also instructed to alert their colleagues to potentially dangerous situations.\n\nE.ON's managers fulfil their responsibility as health and safety leaders in part by going on safety walks and engaging in dialogue with employees. During management visits, known as gemba walks, they can take a close look at workplaces, talk directly with employees, and deepen their understanding of HSE issues, including risks. The Group-wide HSE app (formerly 'Go, See & Talk'), which can be downloaded on PRISMA, facilitates the process. Among other things, it contains questions for each type of work environment, including safety culture and workplace health issues. E.ON managers also use the app to submit answers they received, their own observations, and photos and documents. The information is automatically entered into PRISMA for additional analysis. Since 2022, near misses and unsafe conditions or behaviors can also be recorded in the app. More functions will follow as part of a program called Digitalization@HSE that was launched in the year under review. For example, the app's functions for conducting safety walks will be simplified to better involve all employees. The overarching objective is to improve E.ON's entire HSE performance. The HSE division has conducted quick checks since August 2021. They involve an outside partner evaluating E.ON's safety culture and identifying possible risks. So far, 21 quick checks have been conducted at our operating units.\n\nE.ON runs an HSE Community that extends across all regions and segments. It helps us be a learning company and serves in particular to share knowledge and experience. The community meets regularly and, as needed, in special expert groups. Experts work together to achieve improvements in key areas like incident prevention. The range of topics in 2023 included compliance with Germany's Substitute Construction Materials Regulation (German abbreviation: ErsatzbaustoffV) and Federal Soil Protection and Contaminated Sites Regulation (German abbreviation: BBodSchV), the protection and promotion of biodiversity and species diversity, electrical safety, HSE in the installation business, HSE at the Energy Networks segment, and safety in underground engineering.\n\nThe units and Corporate Functions also work together on Connect, E.ON's Group-wide social media platform. The form and content of HSE topics on the platform are continually expanded and updated. The additions in 2023 included an HSE live dashboard that displays HSE key performance indicators for the entire E.ON Group and updates them daily. The dashboard went live in May.\n\nEmployees and managers who have questions or concerns about their physical or mental health can contact the Employee Assistance Program ('EAP'). The EAP is a free health-advisory and life-coaching service available in multiple languages to E.ON staff in Germany, the United Kingdom, Sweden, Italy, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Hungary. We have similar programs in other countries where we operate. Alongside the EAP, E.ON offers employees and managers one-on-one psycho-social counseling.\n\nThere are also supplementary functions and roles at E.ON, including social, addiction, and health counseling. Across the Company, these functions and roles are performed by employees alongside their regular duties. These employees are obliged to maintain confidentiality.\n\nE.ON employees can also take advantage of specific preventive measures (for example, nutrition counseling, and colon and skin cancer screening), consult company physicians, and take advantage of EAP benefits as well as use company fitness facilities.\n\n## Goals and Performance Review\n\nThe E.ON Management Board is informed about category 3 and 4 incidents, developments relating to accidents, and related measures and programs by means of monthly reports from HSE and regular consultations with the Senior Vice President Group HSE. The units report fatal and life-threatening incidents directly to the Management Board within 24 hours.\n\nThe purpose of E.ON's incident analyses is to understand causes, take measures to prevent them, and identify risks.

In addition, Group Audit may conduct an HSE audit at the unit.\n\nThe findings of the incident investigations and HSE audits completed in 2023 show that HSE management systems are largely effective. The units have adopted the auditors' resulting recommendations and have generally used them to design corrective and preventive actions. It also became clear, however, that employees' safety awareness was not fully adequate in all teams. It therefore remains extremely important to continually point out to E.ON employees and contractor employees all the requirements of HSE management and their own responsibility: they must look after themselves and their colleagues and speak up immediately if they detect a potential safety risk. Overall, E.ON has observed for several years that occupational safety in its units is improving continually. We can clearly see that our measures to prevent serious occupational accidents are having an effect. One example is a discernable shift from serious incidents to less serious incidents. Furthermore, E.ON views audits-and the findings and recommendations they yield-as opportunities to foster continuous improvement.\n\nHealth and safety concerns have always been a high priority for the E.ON Management Board. In 2020 E.ON adopted a new HSE strategy ('Roadmap 2021-23'), endorsed by the HSE Council, whose aim is to position E.ON as a leading HSE company. The strategy contains underlying targets for the operating units, including H&S, and their respective board members. In addition, the Management Board set personal H&S targets for top executives. The targets for top executives and units are individual. Their purpose is to further reduce the frequency of serious incidents and fatalities ('SIF') and thus to reach E.ON's ultimate objective of zero major harm as soon as possible. The changes took effect on January 1, 2021. The primary focus in 2023 was on contractor management and digitalization. In addition, a review program called DSS Quick Checks was used to design additional (in some cases company-specific) measures to improve HSE\n\nprocesses that will be implemented beginning in 2024. Furthermore, stakeholders from E.ON's operating business and HSE managers thoroughly discussed and analyzed the business's challenges and drivers and the resulting key issues for the new health strategy for 2024-2026. These findings were drawn on to design the strategy, which the HSE Council approved at the end of 2023 for implementation at the units and at Group HSE beginning in 2024.\n\nThe extent to which E.ON's health strategy is successful depends in part on whether employees receive information about health and prevention and whether this motivates them to participate in related programs. To increase willingness to participate, health programs are often tailored to the needs of specific target groups. E.ON's network operators in Germany, for example, target their employees aged 50 and over in particular as well as employees in their field offices. Actions include workshops on healthy living in older age and preparing for retirement. There are also special offers, for example, for operational employees such as fitters and administrative staff. The return on investment ('ROI') of many health programs is calculated by comparing costs with avoided absenteeism based on research and statistics. So that all employees feel comfortable, valued, and supported in their work environment, E.ON places particular emphasis on mental health. We provide information on the importance of stress management and show how to recognize signs of mental health issues. In addition, E.ON has assistance and training on stress reduction, self-assessment tests, and a direct support offering, including through the EAP.\n\nTo propel its health strategy in a targeted way, E.ON is also conducting a health inventory across all its companies in Germany and elsewhere in line with its HSE vision. The project's purpose is to actively foster employees' health and well-being and to improve Group-wide transparency regarding health and well-being. Data collected in the health inventory will be used to support E.ON's ongoing efforts for greater collaboration in its HSE organization and to address current challenges and trends. The data will also\n\npromote the sharing of best practices across all units and countries in order to further improve our HSE culture and health management and to jointly set strategic targets and the direction of further HSE culture and health strategies.\n\n## Progress and Measures\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Accident Statistics\n\nSerious incidents and fatalities ('SIF') measures accidents and incidents that caused serious or fatal injuries and that surpass a predefined severity threshold.\n\n## Employee SIF 1\n\n|     |   2023 |   2022 |   2021 |\n|-----|--------|--------|--------|\n| SIF |   0.03 |   0.04 |    0.1 |\n\n1 Serious incidents and fatalities measures accidents and incidents per million hours of work that have caused serious or fatal injuries and that surpass a predefined severity threshold per million hours of work.\n\nAt 0.03 , employee SIF was below the prior-year level (2022: 0.04).\n\n\u203a Contractor SIF increased to 0.06 (2022: 0.05).

Employee LTIF was 2.2 (2022: 2.1).\n\n\u203a Contractor LTIF improved to 1.6 (2022: 2.0). Combined LTIF was 1.9 in 2023 (2022: 2.0) and thus in line with the previous year. \u2039\n\nTotal recordable injury frequency ('TRIF') is one of E.ON's KPIs for safety. It measures the number of recorded work-related injuries and (acute) illnesses per million hours of work. E.ON has calculated it since 2010 (employee TRIF) and included contractor employees' in its safety performance since 2011 (combined TRIF).\n\n## Employee TRIF 1\n\n|        | 2023    | 2022    | 2021    |\n|--------|---------|---------|---------|\n| TRIF 1 | 2.77  \uf098 | 2.90  \uf0d0 | 2.60  \uf0d0 |\n\n1 TRIF measures the number of reported fatalities and occupational injuries and illnesses and also includes injuries that occur during work-related travel that result in lost time or no lost time and/or that lead to medical treatment, restricted work, or work at a substitute work station.\n\nThe TRIF for employees was 2.8 in 2023.\n\n\u203a Contractor TRIF of 2.0 was lower than in the prior year (2022: 2.3). Combined TRIF declined from 2.6 to 2.4 . All accidents were carefully examined, both individually and in comparison. In some cases, this enabled us to identify patterns or multiple predominant causes and respond directly to them, for example, by means of work groups. TRIF declined mainly because of fewer pandemicrelated restrictions and higher investments at some units, which resulted in an increase in the number of construction sites and thus in the number of working hours. \u2039\n\n## Employee NMFR 1\n\n|      | 2023     | 2022     | 2021     |\n|------|----------|----------|----------|\n| NMFR | 40.32  \uf09a | 36.00  \uf0d0 | 34.00  \uf0d0 |\n\n1 Near-miss frequency rate measures unplanned incidents that had the potential to result in an accident (but did not) per million hours of work.\n\n\u25ba Near-miss frequency rate ('NMFR') measures unplanned incidents that had the potential to result in an accident (but did not) per million hours of work. E.ON analyzes how and why near misses happened and then puts in place controls to minimize or eliminate similar risks in the future. We actively encourage employees to report near misses so that we can continually improve our safety performance. E.ON's NMFR was 40 in 2023. \u25c4\n\n## Fatal Accidents at Work\n\nRegrettably, one contractor employee died in 2023 due to an occupational accident. He was an electrician who suffered severe burns from an arc flash in a transformer station. Although first aid was administered immediately and he received medical treatment for three weeks, he ultimately died from his injuries. Each fatal accident is thoroughly investigated so that we understand the exact course of events that led to it. Identifying root causes enables us to take the measures necessary to prevent similar accidents in future. Nevertheless, serious and even fatal accidents still occur. E.ON cannot and will not accept this. It has therefore further intensified its efforts to prevent accidents. Examples are the Company's decision to extend the evaluation of HSE maturity to all E.ON network operators and to make adjustments to the HSE Strategy Roadmap 2021-2023, which place a greater emphasis on risk and contractor management (see 'Goals and Performance Review' above).\n\n## Occupational Health and Safety at PreussenElektra\n\nE.ON's subsidiary PreussenElektra ('PEL') is responsible for the operation, decommissioning, and dismantling of the Company's nuclear power plants ('NPPs'). Its top priorities in all these activities are the health and safety of employees-its own as well\n\nas contractors'-and environmental protection. PEL is fully integrated into E.ON's safety organization and is subject to its high standards. PEL's extensive experience in plant operations and decommissioning helps it continually optimize its HSE processes and procedures and thus to minimize possible risks in conducting its activities. Special focus actions, practical training sessions, and health promotion measures foster and support the safe behavior of PEL and contractor employees. Together, the systematic application of safety standards, the conducting of various training and awareness-raising measures (including for contractors), and continual HSE advice directly at the work site again helped prevent serious accidents in 2023.\n\n## Working Conditions and Employee Development\n\nGRI 2-7, GRI 2-30, GRI 3-3, GRI 401, GRI 404, GRI 405\n\n- \u25ba E.ON's vision is to provide everyone with good energy. More than 72,000 employees worldwide (core workforce in FTE) are working to make it happen. E.ON's human resources ('HR') creates the conditions for all of them to make their contribution. The HR function's cornerstones, which are part of E.ON's vision of HR management, are: attracting great people, developing people, creating a winning culture, and driving digital. They describe how E.ON wants to be the employer of choice and to use innovative formats to continually develop its talent. They also aim to establish a culture of inclusion as well as the greater digitalization of HR processes and the creation of a digital mindset. The HR vision thus serves as the lodestar for HR work in the Group.\n\nThe medium-term HR objectives specify this overarching vision as it is reflected in our Group People Strategy, or GPS@E.ON. This strategy defines the four Group-wide People Priorities. These priorities are the future of work, diversity and inclusion, sustainability, and leadership. HR activities across the Group are aligned with GPS@E.ON and must fundamentally contribute to the People Priorities and their respective key ambitions. The strategy is implemented through Group-wide and local activities. The entire",

Our fundamental corporate values guide employees' actions and interactions with each other, customers, and business partners. They answer the question of what makes E.ON special, what is important to us, and what principles guide our actions.\n\nGrow@E.ON, E.ON's Group-wide competency model, is derived from E.ON's values and is an integral part of GPS@E.ON. It defines the specific behaviors to which the Company is committed. Grow@E.ON is integrated into all HR-related processes and describes how employees and managers should behave toward each other and customers. Its purpose is to enable us to recruit the right employees for the right positions, retain them, and foster their ongoing development. Grow@E.ON provides guidance to staff in their daily work and sets out a clear path for their personal development and professional growth. It is designed to prepare the Company for the continually evolving world of work, in which agility, future-oriented skills, and greater individualization and diversity are at the forefront. All new managers and employees are informed about Grow@E.ON and trained accordingly.\n\nA strong feedback culture is extremely important. Feedback helps employees perform at a high level, to identify opportunities for personal development, and to promote continuous improvement. Such a feedback culture is firmly embedded in GPS@E.ON, E.ON's Group-wide HR strategy. E.ON offers its employees periodic performance and development reviews. The Company also takes a number of steps to foster a feedback culture, including offering training, guidelines for feedback, and support on Connect, its inhouse social network. In addition, YourVoice@E.ON, which we\n\nlaunched in 2023, represents a central and innovative approach to making giving feedback even easier and more efficient for everyone (see 'Specific Actions' below).\n\n## Guidelines and Policies\n\nOur HR management model assigns the central HR function (Group HR/Executive HR) responsibility for Group-wide HR tools and processes as well as binding HR policies. These are defined in a functional policy guideline, which also stipulates the associated tasks. Executive HR, for example, is responsible for the complete life-cycle management of E.ON's top executives. Group HR is responsible for a variety of Company-wide matters. These include executive compensation including a job-grading system for executive roles, the Grow@E.ON competency model, the employer value proposition ('EVP'), Group-wide diversity targets, global learning technologies and content, the International Assignment Policy, the pension framework, and global HR IT governance.\n\nE.ON has in place numerous policies and directives to make work conditions more flexible. These include agreements for home offices and rules on flexible work arrangements such as sabbaticals, part-time work, and special leave. The principles contained in these policies and directives are supported by our codetermination committees and are binding for the entire E.ON Group. The units implement them according to their respective legal, cultural, and business circumstances.\n\nThe compensation principles for our employees are in many cases stipulated by collective bargaining agreements, which cover 82 percent of employees. Whenever possible, E.ON offers permanent employment, which applies to 94 percent of employees. We provide fair pay that enables our employees to live a decent life.\n\n## Organization and Responsibilities\n\nE.ON's HR management is largely decentralized so that it is closer to the business. In 2022 E.ON decided to fine-tune its HR governance model so that topics of Group-wide strategic significance-talent management/diversity and inclusion, learning\n\nand development, EVP, and HR tech-are managed and implemented more centrally. In this context, the Senior Vice President Group HR/Executive HR and the HR leaders of the individual units agree on annual targets.\n\nAn important central task of the HR function is HR management for the Group's top leadership positions. This includes the identification of potential, staffing, succession planning and related long-term talent management. The aim is to continually improve the staff of leadership positions by, for example, having a transparent recruitment process and thus ensuring equal opportunity and diversity. We use overarching criteria and common tools, such as local and global talent boards, to identify talent and potential. Talent boards serve as a forum in which HR and the specialist departments discuss employees with development potential for management roles and their development needs. Within this defined framework, units and facilities can adjust processes to meet their specific needs and challenges.\n\nE.ON takes its employees' interests very seriously and cooperates closely with employee representatives. Almost all E.ON units and Corporate Functions itself have works councils or other forms of employee representation. We can build on the long-standing, constructive, and trusting partnership with employee representatives, especially in times of change; moreover, we actively involve the workforce in all relevant upcoming changes. Employee representatives are involved in employee-related issues in a timely manner in accordance with the laws of individual countries. In Germany this law is the Works Constitution Act. The cooperation between E.ON and E.ON employee representatives is characterized by respectful and open dialog. Early and open exchange with employee representatives on employee-related issues, which is a particularly important aspect of this proven social partnership, is therefore enshrined in a declaration of principles.",

In view of the Covid-19 pandemic, E.ON established hybrid work as a Group-wide standard. We did this to make working at E.ON even more attractive and to position our Company as a modern employer in the future as well. Employees at E.ON companies based in Germany can take a workation. The aim is to give them additional options to make where they work more flexible. In a workation, employees may-to the degree operationally possible and in conformity with agreed-on framework arrangements -temporarily perform their work from an EU country other than the one of their contractual workplace. The aim is to make working at E.ON even more flexible and to respond even more individually to employees' needs.\n\nE.ON offers its employees benefits in addition to their contractual compensation. In addition to the benefits of the Company pension scheme or employer-financed accident insurance, E.ON supports its employees in non-work-related situations or in special life situations, such as when a family member falls ill. Employees in Germany, for example, can take advantage of various services provided or arranged by the Company. These services range from stress and addiction counseling to support in caring for elderly or sick relatives. Employees who fall ill for more than six weeks within a 12-month period receive help with reintegration. In granting these benefits no distinction is made between full-time and part-time employment.\n\nTraining and development are very important for E.ON's attractiveness as an employer and pivotal for E.ON's transformation into a learning organization. All employees receive training at their onboarding, HSE training, and functional training relevant to their role, as well as soft-skills training and access to talent and leadership development programs. These include many digital, self-directed learning opportunities that employees can\n\naccess from anywhere at any time. In addition to Group-wide training opportunities, the units have standardized digital learning offerings. E.ON offers them for onboarding new employees and in part for training strategically important topics like digitalization or health and safety. To simplify their learning, employees can take learning journeys on specific specialist topics. The journeys are offered by the central HR function's People Development team and the central IT function's Digital Empowerment team. Currently, each department is conducting projects to develop strategically important learning content. This involves identifying critical skills and learning needs in line with E.ON's strategy and external market requirements. During the year under review, for example, we identified which core competencies our employees need in which areas to continue managing our digital transformation. We will subsequently offer department-specific learning opportunities so that we can develop the necessary skills in-house. We are currently designing a new process for competence and skills management. We want to use it to automatically identify future-critical skills based on market trends; the process will also draw on new digital functionalities to continuously identify missing skills and learning needs for specialist departments, managers, and employees. The basis for this is an E.ON-wide standardized skill taxonomy. It is managed centrally and continually refined in collaboration with specialist departments.\n\nE.ON believes that the most effective way for employees to learn is through experience and practice. The Company adopts a 70-2010 learning approach: 70 percent of learning happens on the job, 20 percent through social interaction and knowledge sharing with others, and 10 percent by means of programs such as eLearning, seminars, and formal training. E.ON keeps up with the faster pace of the digital age by increasingly replacing long formats with short digital learning formats and self-directed learning. It is part of employees' workflow, it is tailored to their individual needs as much as possible, and it is accessible anytime and anywhere.\n\nIn 2023 E.ON established a one-stop shop for all learning content in order to make learning opportunities for employees even more attractive and easier. This digital platform will combine all E.ONwide learning opportunities in a single place and improve userfriendliness. In addition, E.ON drew up a catalog of learning and development measures by the end of 2022 in order to achieve the goal of becoming a learning organization in the coming years. It ensures a Group-wide, new framework for learning and employee development and was introduced in all units with initial measures in 2023. In the coming years, this will be accompanied by an ongoing internal communication campaign, such as the threeweek Learning Weeks in September 2023 and a Fail and Learn video series with managers. The Learning Weeks took place throughout the Group as an online format. In this context, 72 events were held and over 9,000 employees took part.\n\nE.ON helps people launch their careers by offering apprenticeships for various vocations as well as internships, working student activities, and other programs. Our offerings in Germany include local initiatives to help interested people start their careers with the help of school projects, internships, courses, and expert guidance. We also employ working students who can gain work experience at E.ON and simultaneously finance their education. In 2022 we also launched a new, Group-wide E.ON International Graduate Program ('EIGP') to develop next-generation talent personally and professionally and to retain them at E.ON. Crossfunctional, national, and international assignments enable participants to get to know our business and network Group-wide. We support them with mentoring, coaching, and training. The trainees also work on a joint business project. In 2023 the project involved having trainees conduct a survey to ascertain employees' attitudes towards E.ON's sustainability culture and thus provide important impetus for its evolution.\n\nIn 2023 the EIGP was expanded to include specialist tracks for Customer Solutions, Digital, Finance, and Energy Networks. Entrants in 2023 consisted of 22 university graduates of nine different nationalities. Of these, 14 are in the generalist track and 8",

A total of 37 participants are currently completing the EIGP.\n\n## Goals and Performance Review\n\nWe support our predominantly decentralized HR organization on issues of Group-wide significance or Group-wide value propositions. This includes setting central targets for topics with a Group-wide value proposition. The HR Board-which consists of the Senior Vice President ('SVP') Group HR and representatives of the local HR organizations-defines, prioritizes, and decides on the specific annual HR targets for the implementation of Group-wide value propositions and their measurement criteria. The targets will be reviewed periodically based on the previously defined measurement criteria.\n\nE.ON wants to retain its people (and their expertise) and enable them to grow professionally. One of E.ON's objectives is therefore also to fill management positions internally. At talent boards, E.ON's HR representatives use a special tool to assess how many candidates have participated in an application process and who ultimately filled a vacant position. It also enables E.ON to monitor whether selected candidates come from its own development pool and whether they meet its diversity targets. E.ON's talent boards not only focus on identifying talent and planning succession, but, since 2021, also on diversity aspects. The objective is in part to increase the proportion of women and employees from underrepresented groups among managers. That is why, since 2020, E.ON has been strengthening its commitment and has made diversity a People Priority in GPS@E.ON, its HR strategy. Our talent strategy in 2023 focused on a more inclusive and flexible approach in order to enhance diversity in talent management as well. To support this, we piloted a smart digital platform called My Career Hub in 2023 as well. The platform suggests opportunities to employees that match their skills, interests, and ambitions. Examples include suitable jobs, mentoring opportunities, and project assignments.\n\nE.ON has conducted an annual employee survey since 2014 to find out how its people feel about their job, their supervisor, the work atmosphere in their unit, and other topics. The periodic finetuning of our survey approaches led to the decision to implement a Group-wide employee engagement strategy (YourVoice@E.ON) in 2023. Engagement takes into account a large number of different factors that together contribute to an engagement score. A high score, for example, indicates a high level of employee well-being and a lower risk of fluctuation. A characteristic feature of the new strategy is that employee feedback is recorded and evaluated more regularly. This will enable organizational units such as departments and individual teams to identify engagement issues swiftly and independently, to discuss them as a team, and to have the opportunity to initiate improvements together. Following the gradual implementation of YourVoice@E.ON, it will be the central approach to employee surveys in the E.ON Group, supplemented only selectively by specific, concise surveys on certain topics.\n\nThe centerpiece of the new YourVoice@E.ON approach is a technology platform that, at certain intervals, emails employees questions that address aspects of well-being and the current work situation. Answering the questions is anonymous and voluntary and can be integrated into everyday work with little effort. Managers can access the findings of this ongoing feedback on their dashboards at any time, react to individual aspects or trends, and work with their teams on improvements. This makes YourVoice@E.ON more than a traditional employee survey and supports our feedback culture.\n\n\u203a We conducted our periodic survey of Employee Net Promoter Score ('eNPS') in 2023 as well. eNPS measures employees' willingness to recommend E.ON as an employer. In the 2023 survey, eNPS improved by eight points (+36). \u2039",

This figure includes part-time positions on a pro rata basis. The number of employees increased-by 2,864 FTEs, or 4 percent-in 2023. The proportion of employees working outside Germany (34,715 FTEs) decreased slightly to 48 percent compared with year-end 2022 (49 percent).\n\nThe number of employees at Energy Networks increased. This was mainly attributable to the implementation of our growth strategy, associated network expansion, network modernization and digitalization. The deconsolidation of the VSEH Group in Slovakia had a countervailing effect.\n\nCustomer Solutions' core workforce increased as well. This was mainly due to capacity expansion to meet increased customer requirements and to roll out smart energy meters in the United Kingdom. There was also significantly more growth-driven new hiring in most of the other countries, in particular the Netherlands, Germany, and Hungary. The deconsolidation of the VSEH Group in Slovakia had a countervailing effect at Customer Solutions as well.\n\nThe number of employees at Corporate Functions/Other rose year on year as well, mainly because of hiring and incourcing of digitalization and IT support capabilities. By contrast, the number of employees at PreussenElektra declined owing to the dismantling of its nuclear power plants.\n\n## Core Workforce by Country 1\n\n|                 | Headcount   | Headcount   | FTE    | FTE                                                              |\n|-----------------|-------------|-------------|--------|------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|                 |             |             |        | Dec. 31, 2023    Dec. 31, 2022    Dec. 31, 2023    Dec. 31, 2022 |\n| Germany         | 38,945      | 36,549      | 37,526 | 35,194                                                           |\n| United Kingdom  | 9,742       | 8,769       | 9,420  | 8,437                                                            |\n| Romania         | 7,028       | 6,916       | 6,861  | 6,759                                                            |\n| Hungary         | 6,035       | 5,745       | 6,009  | 5,726                                                            |\n| Czech Republic  | 3,271       | 3,201       | 3,250  | 3,178                                                            |\n| The Netherlands | 3,438       | 2,955       | 3,075  | 2,666                                                            |\n| Sweden          | 2,607       | 2,432       | 2,580  | 2,414                                                            |\n| Poland          | 1,890       | 1,873       | 1,879  | 1,861                                                            |\n| Slovakia 2      | -           | 1,589       | -      | 1,578                                                            |\n| Other           | 1,662       | 1,584       | 1,642  | 1,565                                                            |\n| E.ON Group      | 74,618      | 71,613      | 72,242 | 69,378                                                           |\n\n- 2 The company VSEH operating in Slovakia was deconsolidated in the end of 2023.",

This is a very high takeover rate of 92 percent (2022: 553 of 598, or 93 percent).

E.ON companies made customers aware of support opportunities by including information about alternative tariffs and government subsidy programs in their bills. In addition, customers could use special apps and other tools to better understand their electricity consumption and ways to conserve energy.\n\n## E.ON's Approach\n\nE.ON continually measures and improves the experience we offer to our customers, in order to retain-and, ideally, deepen-their loyalty. It is essential for us to be systematically customer-centric. The E.ON brand promises to give our customers what they want in the future energy world: consistently positive experiences with our services and smart, sustainable solutions. E.ON transports energy from where it is produced to where it is needed. We also work to empower people, companies, and cities across Europe to create the sustainable world that they want to live in. The purpose is to build energy communities in which everyone can do their part and meet these needs-from a household opting for green electricity to an entire city committing to sustainability. Delivering on this promise will make the E.ON brand distinctive and enable us to successfully expand our business. E.ON's objective is to become the number one energy-solutions company in all of its markets and thus to live up to its ambition of being the leading company of the energy transition.\n\nIn 2023 E.ON revised its market positioning to underscore its leading role in the energy transition. As part of this process, we surveyed customers and consumers about what characteristics they think such a company should have. They told us that it should have the necessary size and market strength and above all\n\ntechnical innovativeness and a vision of the future energy world. All this was accompanied by a desire for reliability and stability.\n\n## Organization and Responsibilities\n\nThe Chief Executive Officer ('CEO') coordinates, from Corporate Functions, our brand and marketing strategy with the aim of further developing and strengthening the E.ON brand. The Chief Operating Office-Commercial ('COO-C') supports the sales and energy solutions business for all customer segments and in all E.ON markets. The regional units' Customer Experience teams are responsible for customer satisfaction. They carry out projects and measures in their respective sales territories and exchange information on successful approaches and progress on a monthly basis. There are Customer Experience teams in Germany, the United Kingdom, Italy, Romania, Sweden, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, and the Netherlands.\n\nE.ON's Global Customer Leadership team, which consists of senior Customer Experience leaders from the entire Group and representatives from the Customer and Market Insights team, successfully continued its work in 2023. Its purpose is to listen to customers more and foster customer centricity in all E.ON markets. The team met four times in the year under review to assess Customer Experience activities, identify areas of focus for cross-regional collaboration, and give customers a stronger voice.\n\nThe Customer and Market Insights team studies which trends shape our customers' attitudes and behaviors. It conducts consumer studies, broad-based market research, and advanced data analyses and models possible scenarios. The aim is to obtain practical knowledge and incorporate it into business processes.\n\n## Specific Actions\n\nE.ON measures the loyalty and trust of its existing and potential customers by means of Net Promoter Score ('NPS'), which was introduced in 2009 and became a Group-wide program in 2013. NPS indicates customers' willingness to recommend E.ON and its services. It also helps us identify which issues are currently of particular importance to customers and thus to adapt our activities to current customer needs. E.ON measures two types of NPS:\n\n- \u00b7 Strategic NPS compares E.ON's performance with that of its competitors and is based on the feedback of customers regardless of whether they have had any interaction with E.ON.\n- \u00b7 Journey NPS measures the loyalty of current and potential customers who have completed one or more interactions 1 with E.ON - for example, if E.ON helped them transferring their energy service to their new residence when they move.\n\nNPS is used by our regional units in Germany, the United Kingdom, Italy, Romania, Sweden, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, and the Netherlands.\n\nA methodology introduced in 2017 enables us to measure strategic NPS consistently across all markets and thus to identify and resolve customer issues experienced in multiple markets. It also makes it easier for us to recognize the areas in which useful innovations can be offered to customers. The methodology is based on an automated reporting process. It therefore avoids the errors of manual data entry and improves data quality and auditability.",

E.ON uses both indicators at the segment and unit level for purposes of management control. Strategic NPS is highly relevant for management control because of the information it provides about competitors. The E.ON Management Board has received a monthly NPS report since September 2020. In addition, periodic market reports enable the Chief Operating OfficerCommercial and the CEOs of the regional units to exchange views on NPS issues and customer topics. NPS also plays a role in executives' variable compensation. This consists of two components: one factor reflects an executive's individual performance, the other the company performance. Progress in strategic and journey NPS has accounted for 20 percent of the calculation of the company performance since 2020. The achievement of NPS targets is also factored into determining the E.ON Management Board's compensation.\n\nIn 2023, which operational journey NPS data must be measured by all regions was defined centrally for the first time. From January 2024 onward, these are the data on complaint management and the payment process. The regions completed a self-assessment in order to have a uniform basis for data collection. Baseline measurement began in the fourth quarter of 2023.\n\nSince 2017, each unit has also established its own measures to systematically improve customer perception. These activities are initiated and overseen by the units' CEO and board members because they are personally responsible for their unit's NPS performance. They review the measures annually and readjust them. They increasingly include sustainability criteria. The measures' duration can cover several years, depending on the scope of the planned adjustments.\n\n## Security of Supply\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGRI 2-6, GRI 3-3, GRI G4 Sector Disclosures Electric Utilities\n\nE.ON's objective as an energy company and distribution system operator is to ensure a secure supply of electricity to its customers. A reliable electricity supply is essential for industrialized countries to be able to maintain their economy and meet their inhabitants' basic needs. For example, industrial customers that operate highprecision production facilities require a constant network frequency. If frequency fluctuates, machinery can break down, resulting in additional costs. A complete interruption of the electricity supply can have serious consequences, and not just for industrial customers. At companies, government agencies, and households, most processes are no longer possible without electricity. One challenge in power supply is that energy is increasingly being generated decentrally and consequently fed into the E.ON network from many different points. Moreover, renewables feed-in fluctuates because it depends on the weather and other factors beyond E.ON's control.\n\n## E.ON's Approach\n\nE.ON wants to operate secure and stable networks in a future energy world as well and thus offer its customers a reliable electricity supply at reasonable costs. That is why E.ON is upgrading to smart grids by equipping networks with sensors and control technology, increasing the level of automation, and adding a digital layer. This will enable us to manage energy flows in line with demand and to monitor our grids in real time and with much greater granularity than today. Additionally, as is described in greater detail below under 'Specific Actions,' smart-grid technology makes it possible for us to partially avoid or delay some grid expansion.\n\nGoing forward, smart grids will serve as the platform for the innovative technologies and new business models that contribute to the energy transition's success. Examples include:\n\n- \u00b7 Flexible tariff models that use price incentives to influence demand and thus help stabilize networks\n- \u00b7 The aggregation of multiple distributed power generating units into virtual power plants that respond dynamically to changes in consumption\n- \u00b7 Peer-to-peer sharing solutions, such as for households and businesses\n- \u00b7 Fluctuation-tolerant local energy systems that have battery, gas, or heat storage devices and their own generating units\n\nWe continued the E.ON Lab in 2023 to study more potential innovations. In Arnsberg/Sundern and L\u00fcneburg, Germany, E.ON is testing the extent to which various aspects of a future energy world are feasible, useful, and scalable. E.ON is expanding its digital equipment in these communities and assessing the value that such smart solutions add for customers and networks. We are also exploring whether and how current energy-market regulation can better reflect customer needs. E.ON's smart solutions promote secure and efficient network operation. This gives us a transparent view of the operating status of network equipment and energy flows and enables us to make targeted use of the flexibility available in our networks.\n\n## Guidelines and Policies\n\nIn 2021 E.ON adopted a strategy for deploying more smart technology (smartification) in its low- and medium-voltage grids. The strategy applies in Germany and all other countries in Europe where the Company operates. E.ON's smart-tech deployment targets vary by country but generally far exceed those set by each country's regulatory agency. We monitor progress using key performance indicators ('KPIs') on a regular basis.\n\n## Organization and Responsibilities\n\nE.ON's regional network companies are responsible for the safe and reliable operation of its distribution networks.

They are also responsible for resolving unforeseeable outages in their service territory. E.ON's crisis management system defines the responsibilities and procedures for dealing with widespread disruptions. The Incident and Crisis Management policy provides guidelines for such situations. The Chief Operating Officer-Networks ('COO-N') oversees the Energy Networks segment. Under his leadership, three departments (Energy Networks Europe, Energy Networks Germany, and Energy Networks Technology & Innovation) at Corporate Functions manage the segment's regional units. These departments' tasks include strategic development, investment planning, and asset management.\n\n## Specific Actions\n\nE.ON has investment and maintenance programs under which it expands and maintains its networks in line with demand. E.ON will invest \u20ac33 billion from 2023 to 2027, of which \u20ac26 billion will go toward network expansion. This is intended to enable us to ensure that all our network customers are connected to the network and receive a reliable energy supply. Our regional network companies are responsible for carrying out the measures, which are planned for one or more years. E.ON invested about \u20ac5.2 billion in network expansion in 2023. Part of the investment budget went toward the gradual expansion of smart grids: E.ON's network structure is being progressively equipped with sensors, control and relay technology, as well as being automated and digitally networked. The increasing use of smart-grid technology makes it possible to avoid or delay costly investments in network expansion, for example, by using new technology to making better use of existing overhead lines. Investment decisions always consider the efficiency of each measure alongside security of supply. This means that E.ON chooses those solutions that make the most sense from both a technical and business standpoint. This is because network investments also affect network fees, which account for a portion of the electricity price paid by customers.\n\n## Goals and Performance Review\n\nE.ON's regional network companies record all planned and unplanned service interruptions in their distribution networks. The data collected are aggregated into the system average interruption duration index ('SAIDI') for electricity. It indicates the average interruption duration per customer and year.\n\nE.ON reports the SAIDI of its fully consolidated network companies by country. The figures for Germany reflect the weighted average of its fully consolidated network companies\n\nthere. They are calculated using the method prescribed by the Federal Network Agency (known by its German acronym, 'BNetzA'). The calculations are based on service interruptions that have been verified by the BNetzA. All other countries in which E.ON operates networks have similar quality standards. Their national regulatory agencies verify and validate network operators' outage reports. The SAIDI figures for each country therefore reflect the methodology prescribed by its regulatory agency. These key figures are generally reported without interruptions due to force majeure; exceptions are indicated accordingly.\n\n## SAIDI Power 1 G4-EU29\n\n|                       | 2023   | 2023                      | 2023   | 2022   | 2022                      | 2022   | 2021   | 2021                      | 2021   |\n|-----------------------|--------|---------------------------|--------|--------|---------------------------|--------|--------|---------------------------|--------|\n| Minutes per  customer |        | Scheduled     Unscheduled | Total  |        | Scheduled     Unscheduled | Total  |        | Scheduled     Unscheduled | Total  |\n| Germany               | 6      | 15                        | 21     | 7      | 16                        | 24     | 7      | 15                        | 22     |\n| Sweden 2, 3           | 33     | 123                       | 156    | 30     | 91                        | 121    | 26     | 91                        | 116    |\n| Hungary               | 94     | 57                        | 151    | 87     | 54                        | 141    | 117    | 58                        | 175    |\n| Czech Republic 2      | 154    | 99                        | 253    | 144    | 308                       | 451    | 134    | 47                        | 181    |\n| Romania               | 254    | 76                        | 331    | 293    | 89                        | 382    | 297    | 259                       | 556    |\n| Poland 3              | 7      | 64                        | 71     | 11     | 39                        | 50     | 7      | 38                        | 45     |\n\n1 Totals may deviate due to rounding.\n\n2 Including influence of force majeure.\n\n3 Increase in 2023 (2022 data) due to several days of extreme weather conditions and storms.",

This report is intended to contain final figures on the continuity of supply that have been officially validated. Consequently, the country-specific figures for the prior year are disclosed below.\n\nAlthough E.ON does not use SAIDI and SAIFI for management control purposes, these figures provide important information on network service quality. At regular intervals, our network operators inform the E.ON Management Board member responsible for network operations about their supply reliability.\n\nThe following presentation of key figures on service quality considers different causes when classifying disruption-related interruptions in individual countries because their respective national regulatory agencies use different methodologies.

We therefore feel obliged to make a contribution to their prosperity, economic development, sustainability, and quality of life. We do this primarily by creating jobs and by offering energy solutions that enhance our customers' sustainability and comfort. In addition, E.ON engages in community involvement and supports employee volunteering in all regions where it operates.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n\uf09a\n\nOur unit representatives know their country's needs and challenges best. So E.ON lets them decide which projects and organizations to support. We believe that local decision-making is more suitable than central directives for giving our community involvement activities a societal impact.\n\nIn order to better coordinate Group-wide and regional activities as well as the commitment of the E.ON Foundation and to increase its social impact, we have bundled E.ON SE's and the E.ON Foundation's activities and linked them more closely. In this way, we want to ensure that responsibility for content coordination, decisions on projects, and process design lies in one hand.\n\n## Our Community Investments\n\nE.ON reports its corporate giving by the categories below.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAlongside corporate giving, E.ON makes strategic investments in community involvement, which are typically more long-term in nature. In 2023 the financial resources for sponsorships went toward three focus areas: climate protection, access to energy, and support for the next generation.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Guided by the conviction that a purely government-mandated, over-regulated energy transition will not succeed, it supports projects, events, and practical formats relating to energy and society. In 2023 the foundation made about \u20ac 1.1 million in donations and provided more than \u20ac 1.9 million in funding to the projects it supports. Because the foundation is independent, this funding is not included in E.ON's community investments.\n\n## Corporate Volunteering\n\nIn 2023 employees were again actively involved in non-profit projects in all regions in which E.ON operates. In total, 3 672 E.ON employees performed 22 129 hours of volunteer work in 2023. This figure may include double counting of employees who volunteer more than once.\n\n## Data Protection, Cybersecurity, and Product Safety \uf0d0\n\nGRI 3-3, GRI 418\n\nE.ON processes personal data of a variety of stakeholders, primarily customers, employees, enterprise partners, and suppliers. We have a Group-wide data protection organization, which we continually improve. E.ON evaluates its processing activities on an ongoing basis in order to comply with applicable regulations and to protect data subjects' rights and personal data. In addition, E.ON has a broad-based cybersecurity organization whose aim is to efficiently protect systems and data regardless of where they are accessed from, which devices are used, and where the data are processed. Safeguarding all company information-in\n\nE.ON offers its customers digital solutions (like the E.ON Home app and the E.ON Drive app) as well as a steadily expanding range of products installed at their premises. This includes solar and battery storage systems, heating systems (including heat pumps and boilers), and electric vehicle charging points. Ensuring that these products are safe is essential for E.ON to protect its customers' health, retain their trust, and continue to serve them successfully.\n\n## E.ON's Approach\n\nE.ON takes compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation ('GDPR') and national regulations seriously and aims to protect natural persons-above all customers, employees, suppliers, and other third parties-when processing their personal data. In principle, all natural persons may themselves determine the extent to which their personal data are processed. E.ON Group's Data Protection Management System ('DPMS'), which is based on IDW PS 980, an audit standard for compliance management systems, describes the minimum standards for data protection within the E.ON Group. The DPMS is implemented by the individual units and, at the same time, serves to ensure a structured, coordinated, and consistent approach to data protection. The DSMS was extensively reviewed in 2023. In addition, E.ON studied major data breach cases of other companies that became public and used these insights to further improve its own data protection and IT security measures and to harden its IT infrastructure.\n\nIn 2022 E.ON revised its data protection contracts, in particular EU model clauses, and other documents relevant to data protection. Among other things, E.ON focused on implementing and updating contracts for third-country transfers and assessments of the level of protection in third countries (transfer impact assessment). Data protection is an ongoing task amid rapidly evolving technologies and practices. Using the plan-do-check-act ('PDCA') method\n\nenables E.ON to continually improve these processes (for more information, see 'Goals and Performance Review' below). These activities continued in 2023.\n\nTo protect all company information, E.ON has in place an Information Security Management System ('ISMS') based on the standards of the ISO 2700x series, widely recognized international standards for information security. The ISMS is certified for those parts of the organization where it is required by law. E.ON works to ensure and maintain the confidentiality, availability, and integrity of its information resources. This includes monitoring infrastructure, vulnerabilities, and threats as well as detecting and responding to security events like cyberattacks. For this purpose, in-house and outside experts conducted extensive security tests of the systems on a regular basis. In 2023 E.ON again updated its cybersecurity strategy and designed a roadmap for implementing it. Items on the roadmap include improving security awareness, identity and access management, cloud security, and new detection and prevention capabilities.\n\nE.ON extend its high standards for occupational health and safety to the products it offers customers. The Company sets uniform standards to ensure that its products are safe throughout their life cycle, from development to recycling. Our ambition is to comply fully with all existing laws and regulations. This applies likewise to applicable safety laws and regulations. If, in the case of innovative products, current laws and regulations lag behind the state of the art, E.ON meets more stringent safety standards. Due to confidentiality constraints and the sensitivity of such data, E.ON cannot provide information about complaints concerning data breaches, regardless of whether these complaints were substantiated or not.\n\n## Guidelines and Policies\n\nE.ON's Data Protection Policy defines roles and responsibilities in a uniform manner across the whole Group. The information security standards introduced in 2018, which are based on the ISO 2700x series of standards, apply to the entire Group as well. They enable",

E.ON's People Guideline 'Cybersecurity' summarizes the most important cybersecurity rules relevant for all employees.\n\n## Organization and Responsibilities\n\nEach unit in the Group is responsible for complying with data protection regulations, above all the GDPR, and implementing the DPMS. E.ON has established processes across the Group to comply with data protection requirements, for example to respond to data subject inquiries and report data protection breaches. This set of processes also provides guidance when individual units implement the necessary processes.\n\nThe units are responsible for responding to all requests from data subjects, such as access to information on data processing, rectification, deletion, and data portability. The units' systems and policies must also comply with their national data protection regulations and those of any other countries where they operate. Where required by law, the units have appointed Data Protection Officers ('DPOs'). The units' DPOs work closely together and report regularly to the Group DPO, in particular on information relating to legal and regulatory developments and fines, the protection of data subjects' rights, relations to third parties, fulfilment of documentation duties, and correspondence with supervisory authorities.\n\nE.ON's Group DPO is responsible for higher-level data protection issues at the Group level. In addition, the units' DPOs and employees are informed on a regular basis about relevant developments relating to data protection by means of periodic information-sharing meetings between the Group DPO and the units' DPOs. This and other information is disseminated by email and through internal communications channels, such as the corporate intranet. Furthermore, the Group DPO reports periodically to the Cybersecurity and Data Protection Council,\n\nwhich also includes Management Board members, and to the Supervisory Board's Audit and Risk Committee.\n\nThe Cybersecurity function prevents the danger that technology and information from having an adverse impact on E.ON's business and customers. Its tasks include designing a Group-wide cybersecurity strategy, monitoring its implementation, and coordinating the cybersecurity organization across E.ON. E.ON's Chief Information Security Officer ('CISO') oversees the Groupwide cybersecurity organization and assigned to the Management Board's digital remit. His responsibilities include formulating E.ON's cybersecurity strategy and monitoring its implementation. The Group-wide cybersecurity organization includes Information Security Officers ('ISOs') appointed by the business units. They report to the CISO as well as to their unit's board on all relevant matters arising in their organizations. The CISO reports on a regular basis-as well as ad hoc in the event of serious security incidents-to the E.ON SE Management Board and the Supervisory Board. These vertical and horizontal reporting pathways ensure transparent and consistent reporting.\n\nE.ON's regional units know their customers, their products, and the local market conditions and requirements. Consequently, their Product Development teams take the lead in product safety, supported by their unit's Health, Safety, and Environment ('HSE') department. They also work closely with several divisions and departments at Corporate Functions, primarily B2C/B2SME Solution Management, Innovation, HSE, and Sustainability. In addition, B2C has its own product safety and compliance team.\n\n## Specific Actions\n\nAll new E.ON Group employees receive data protection training during their first year as part of their onboarding process. In addition, E.ON conducts specific training for entities and departments-such as call centers and sales organizations-that process personal data on a bigger scale. Employees use an eLearning module to familiarize themselves with the GDPR's rules\n\nannually. By the end of 2023, 82 percent of employees completed the module.\n\nE.ON uses training, phishing simulations, and in-house workshops such as live hacking demonstrations to familiarize its employees with cybersecurity risks and their obligation to keep confidential company information secure. To enable its employees to handle information properly, E.ON uses a classification tool, including electronic document labelling, which was introduced in 2022. E.ON conducts an ongoing phishing awareness campaign that involves simulated phishing emails sent to employees several times a month. In addition, E.ON periodically performs penetration-testing for crucial services in order to further harden key services against cyberattacks.\n\nE.ON takes a variety of steps to address health and safety issues across the entire life cycle of its products. During product development, E.ON closely observes current standards and guidelines and monitors emerging issues. The regional units test all market-ready products, including eMobility solutions, for CE/UKCA conformity in their own test labs or have them tested in E.ON's test lab in Essen or by outside testing firms. Products that are CE-compliant meet EU-wide requirements for safety, health, and environmental protection, while UKCA-compliant products meet the British market's compliance requirements. This provides E.ON with a comprehensive assessment of risks, their likelihood, and other potential implications. Contractors who install and maintain products on E.ON's behalf must undergo prequalification prior to hiring to ensure that they meet specific standards and values. In addition, E.ON engages in ongoing dialogue with its contractors and trains them to ensure that they adhere to all requirements and the latest technical standards. Safety training, for example, is mandatory for all installers of solar and battery solutions in Germany. If a product has a safety-related issue, E.ON needs to be able to recall it immediately. E.ON therefore checks and tracks all hardware product changes so that it can contact customers immediately in the event of safety-related issue. We work to continually improve these processes.",

These include establishing a system to ensure product traceability and putting in place a plan for corrective measures. Other requirements include product certification, CE/UKCA labeling, the issuance of E.ON's own EU/UKCA Declaration of Conformity, and the creation and maintenance of a product's full technical documentation. In the event of safetyrelated issues, E.ON immediately informs the appropriate market surveillance agency about the issue and the intended corrective measures, such as withdrawal, warning, and recall. E.ON is also obligated to take necessary corrective actions.\n\n## Goals and Performance Review\n\nThe recurring PDCA cycle results in the DPMS's processes being continually planned, implemented, managed, and improved. This enables E.ON to permanently monitor the DPMS's effectiveness, proactively and repeatedly look for potential blind spots, and take action if the need for improvement arises. E.ON units report on the status quo of their compliance with the GDPR on a quarterly basis. The review also includes regular assessments by Group Audit. The units implement Group Audit's recommendations in a timely manner. Where it was possible to conclude ongoing proceedings with data protection agencies, this was done without sanctions. The existing DPMS is therefore effective and robust.\n\nE.ON assesses the maturity of its ISMS domains regularly and reports the findings to the Cyber Security and Data Protection Council on a quarterly basis. E.ON defined a minimum maturity level for all areas and units. If deficiencies or improvement potential are identified, E.ON adjusts its cybersecurity roadmaps accordingly.\n\nProduct safety incidents are documented at the unit whose product was involved and at the Group level. The investigation and analysis of such incidents help us identify their causes and determine how to prevent them in future. E.ON shares the insights gained in this process with all relevant departments.\n\n## Business Resilience Management \uf0d0\n\n## GRI 3-3\n\nThe health, safety, and security of employees and customers, environmental protection, and the reliability of the energy supply are particularly important to E.ON. We work continually to ensure the safety, security, and reliability of our infrastructure and customer solutions and to become even more resilient to operational interruptions and disruptions. If a crisis occurs despite comprehensive precautions, E.ON responds swiftly and handles the situation professionally.\n\nThe impact of the war in Ukraine in particular continued to present a challenge in 2023. As in the prior year, we faced, among other things, a potential energy shortage and an overall increased threat to energy infrastructure.\n\n## E.ON's Approach\n\nE.ON has a comprehensive framework in place consisting of various minimum requirements for the purpose of conducting business resilience management. It addresses physical security issues and includes specifications for implementing crisis and business continuity management. Nevertheless, the Company cannot rule out the possibility of crises caused by, for example, a natural disaster, human or technical failure, a cyberattack, or another security-related incident, or a corresponding event. That is why integrated business continuity management encompasses, for example, elaborate contingency plans. They specify both organizational and operational measures to enable a fast, efficient, and predefined response and the continued operation of critical activities. In the event of a crisis, E.ON has a Group-wide crisis organization with several highly specialized crisis management teams that are organized locally and centrally; they conduct exercises on a regular basis in order to be able to respond quickly to critical events. E.ON prepares thoroughly to respond to such exceptional situations in the best possible way and prevent escalation and acts quickly and purposefully at the first signs. The\n\nmain objective of crisis prevention and management measures is to protect human life, the environment, the business, and property. This approach has proven its worth in past crises.\n\n## Guidelines and Policies\n\nE.ON's Business Resilience function policy defines responsibilities and roles as well as organizational requirements and provides recommendations on how the business units can establish, operate, and continually refine an effective business resilience management system. The E.ON SE Management Board is responsible for approving the function policy. The policy's theme encompasses the following overarching areas of operational resilience: physical security, business continuity management, emergency and crisis management, and travel security. In addition, the policy requires the units to report critical incidents, serious security incidents, and incidents with crisis potential to the Security Response Center, which is operational at all times. These requirements make it possible to manage, as soon as possible, unpredictable and complex situations that could have a significant impact on E.ON's business, assets, stakeholders, and/or reputation. If necessary, the central Business Resilience function supports the business units in establishing the mechanisms and meeting the minimum requirements. An overarching Business Resilience Community provides additional support and information sharing. More information on the Business Resilience Community can be found below under 'Specific Actions.'\n\n## Organization and Responsibilities\n\nUltimate responsibility for preventing and managing crises lies with the E.ON Management Board. Strategic implementation of physical security topics for the Group as well as operational implementation for E.ON SE are carried out by the Business Resilience function, which is part of the Legal, Compliance, and Security department. With the exception of travel security, operational implementation at the business units is conducted by their respective business resilience organizations, which are responsible for meeting Group-wide minimum standards for business resilience. Alongside this regular organization, E.ON has a",

It is divided into the respective operational business/regional or country level and at the Group level. The Security Response Center is the central reporting point for dealing with crises.\n\n## Specific Actions\n\nTo be able to respond quickly and adequately to crisis situations at all times, E.ON designs and conducts several realistic crisis simulations and training sessions each year. In 2023 E.ON conducted two Group-wide crisis simulations in national and international environments, several local crisis exercises at business units, and ongoing training and continuing education for designated crisis management teams. All members of these teams are required to participate in regular exercises and training sessions. In addition, all members of the crisis management team receive a one-time onboarding training session for their respective functions as well as additional training if required. Among other things, crisis team leaders are trained to lead a team in complex, stressful, time-critical, and uncertain situations.\n\nIn addition to crisis management activities, the Business Resilience function conducts other measures to enable E.ON to achieve lasting operational resilience. The main activities in 2023 were to:\n\n- \u00b7 enhance governance by updating the minimum requirements for business resilience\n- \u00b7 harmonize Business Continuity activities\n- \u00b7 strengthen our security culture by conducting an awareness campaign that featured an eLearning module\n- \u00b7 deploy and introduce central digital tools in line with the Group's digitalization strategy\n\n## Goals and Performance Review\n\nE.ON relies on valuable security expertise and has effective services and networks to ensure that its operating business can be\n\ncontinuously maintained. This enables the Company to continually increase its own operational resilience. E.ON has set the following objectives for this purpose:\n\nProactive crisis management enables E.ON to identify crises at an early stage and respond to them rapidly and effectively and ensures the necessary Group-wide crisis management capabilities. Another aim is to carry out regular checks to make sure that the necessary infrastructure for crisis teams is in place and operational. The Company also assesses, documents, and uses findings from all crisis management exercises, training sessions, and actual incidents to design and implement improvement measures.\n\nBusiness continuity management is designed to ensure that E.ON can deal with emergencies and continue operating critical activities in the event of a disruption. For this purpose, a business impact analysis must identify and examine all critical processes at least once a year. Its findings are used to design, update, and test business continuity plans and solutions.\n\nWith the help of Group-wide services, E.ON aims to minimize the risk for employees when travelling and at any place at work. This includes the use of widely accepted digital solutions.\n\nE.ON's objective for physical security is to protect its employees, property, and assets. For this purpose, the current security situation and threats are continuously analyzed and incorporated into physical security plans and solutions.\n\nOne focus in the 2023 reporting year was to achieve a high awareness of business resilience issues in the organization and enhance collaboration and information sharing in the Business Resilience Community. Cross-departmental involvement and engagement with business resilience raised the visibility and also helped sharpen the profile of the Business Resilience function.\n\n## Crisis Prevention at PreussenElektra\n\nPreussenElektra ('PEL') is only allowed to operate a nuclear power plant ('NPP') if it can demonstrate that it has taken all practicable steps to prevent a severe accident. PEL demonstrates its compliance on an ongoing basis to the relevant authorities, such as the Federal Ministry for the Environment, the Reactor Safety Commission, and state-level agencies.\n\nIn 2023 there were no known security- and safety-related incidents that significantly affected the security and safety level at PEL's NPPs. They remained at the normal long-term security and safety level. On average, ten to 15 reportable events per year occur at PEL's NPPs. PEL headquarters conducts periodic reviews in which it discusses incidents and the findings derived from them with the NPPs that are in operation and those being dismantled. In line with Germany's nuclear ordinances and regulations, the incidents, findings, and any measures taken in response are communicated to state and federal authorities.\n\nPEL regularly conducts statutory nuclear emergency and crisis exercises, notifies Business Resilience Management at E.ON SE, and reports on its results.",

Customers, business partners, or other stakeholders should not be deceived, lied to, or otherwise deliberately harmed. We are committed to ensuring that laws are strictly obeyed, and that integrity and compliance are systematically promoted as core components of our corporate culture. This is the only way for us to retain and deepen our stakeholders' trust for the long term.\n\nNegligence or deliberate violations could lead to fines and criminal prosecution for the employees in question and could harm E.ON's reputation. Corruption is unacceptable for another reason as well: it leads to decisions being made for the wrong reasons. It can thus impede progress and innovation, distort competition, and do lasting damage to E.ON and its stakeholders.\n\nE.ON therefore takes potential compliance violations very seriously. If they are substantiated, we systematically pursue and punish them. E.ON's approach to compliance and anticorruption is applicable for all business units and Corporate Functions and extends to suppliers as well. Information on compliance notices can be found in the 'Progress and Measures' section below.\n\n## E.ON's Approach\n\nE.ON is committed to combating corruption in all its manifestations and supports national and international efforts directed against it. The Company's participation in the United Nations Global Compact underscores its rejection of any form of corruption. The E.ON Management Board has the ultimate responsibility for ensuring that E.ON conducts its business legally, and at all times refrains from criminal practices in achieving its business objectives. To ensure this for all business units, E.ON has\n\nestablished a central compliance function. Its task is to support the E.ON Management Board in its responsibility to prevent, detect, and eliminate corporate crime.\n\nE.ON has in place a compliance management system ('CMS') to mitigate the risk of compliance violations. The CMS is based on a number of widely recognized practices, including measures to foster a compliance culture and a commitment to compliance targets (see 'Goals and Performance Review'). It also enables us to identify and analyze compliance risks, design a risk-adequate compliance program, and expand our compliance organization.\n\n## Guidelines and Policies\n\nOur Code of Conduct and our Supplier Code of Conduct (both of which are available in the languages of all countries in which we operate) focus on our guiding principle, 'Doing the right thing.' They provide easy-to-understand guidance for all areas that are relevant to E.ON. These include human rights, anticorruption, fair competition, and compliant relationships with business partners. The E.ON Code of Conduct also contains an integrity test that employees can use to check whether they are doing the right thing. All employees are obligated under their employment contract to act in accordance with the Code of Conduct's rules. In addition, ten People Guidelines, which apply to all business units, explain in detail how employees can be sure that they are doing things right. Our Code of Conduct is widely recognized by experts. The quarterly magazine of BCM, a professional association for compliance managers in Germany, last reviewed our Code of Conduct in 2021 and awarded it the highest mark among all DAX companies.\n\nAn important People Guideline that supports the Code of Conduct addresses anticorruption. It contains a decision-making scheme that uses the familiar green, amber, and red of traffic lights to indicate when accepting or granting offers or gifts is permissible, potentially problematic, or forbidden. Gratuities (such as donations and sponsorships) above a certain threshold, which varies by national law, must be approved by the local Compliance Officer.\n\nParticularly strict requirements apply to invitations and gifts from public, elected, or government officials and their representatives. The Code of Conduct clearly states E.ON's prohibition against Company donations to political parties, political candidates, political officeholders, or representatives of public agencies.\n\nE.ON's Compliance Function Policy defines basic compliance structures, roles, and responsibilities.\n\nIn 2023 we began to reedit all compliance policies on the basis of legal design principles to make them more readable and comprehensible.\n\n## Organization and Responsibilities\n\nE.ON refines and optimizes its CMS on an ongoing basis. Pursuant to the Compliance Function Policy, we have established a Groupwide organizational setup for this purpose. It consists of the Chief Compliance Officer ('CCO'), the Global Head of Compliance & Data Protection along with his Group Compliance team, and the business units' compliance officers. The CCO reports on a quarterly basis to the E.ON Management Board and to the Supervisory Board's Audit and Risk Committee on the CMS's effectiveness and current developments and incidents. In the event of serious incidents, the Management Board and the Audit and Risk Committee are informed without delay. Suspected fraudulent activities directed against the Company are investigated Group Audit. The central Group Compliance and Data Protection function is responsible for investigating fraud within the Company.\n\n## Specific Actions\n\nIn 2023 we continued to make eLearning courses available to all employees and managers Group-wide. They are offered by a variety of departments. The training plan's topics include compliance and anticorruption as well as other legal areas such as data protection, cybersecurity, and human rights. Since 2010 all employees have had to complete a Code of Conduct eLearning module on a regular basis. Employees in units without Internet access receive this training in written form and also at a face-to-face event.",

It familiarizes them with Company rules and whom to contact if they have questions or feel uncertain about a decision. In addition, new managers receive integrity training that helps them fulfill their function as role models in E.ON's compliance culture.\n\nWe distributed a specially produced postcard to E.ON leaders in 2023 with the motto 'What kind of a leader do you want to be?' The purpose was to motivate them to talk to their employees about misconduct and error culture in order to find out whether misconduct and errors are openly addressed in their teams or whether problems tend to go unaddressed.\n\nE.ON also uses a variety of tools to identify the areas of activity where the risk for certain compliance breaches is particularly high. Such compliance risk assessments ('CRAs') are conducted on an ongoing basis. CRAs employ various methods, ranging from spreadsheet-style questionnaires to personal (and confidential, if applicable) discussions with executives and employees. Based on the findings, Group Compliance determines whether specific measures need to be taken to amend and refine the CRAs in order to appropriately address any (new) potential risks identified.\n\nIn addition, Group Compliance continually engages in dialogue with the compliance officers appointed by local units' management and monitors their work. If employees suspect misconduct or a violation of laws or Company policies, they are instructed to report it. For this purpose, they may use-if they prefer, anonymously-internal reporting channels or an IT-based Whistleblower system. The system meets the requirements of Germany's Whistleblower Protection Act. It is available Groupwide and can be accessed via the E.ON home page or by telephone. Not only E.ON employees, but also business partners, their employees, and other third parties can contact the hotline confidentially. Group Compliance forwards the information to the relevant department or unit.\n\nE.ON wants to ensure that its compliance standards are adhered to in its supply chain as well. We therefore subject potential suppliers to a compliance check to assess whether they act in accordance with our values and principles. To ensure that they meet our compliance standards, we also conduct a prequalification process to verify potential suppliers' identity. This includes, for example, determining whether a supplier appears in the media in connection with compliance issues such as corruption or on an official sanction and terrorism lists. In some cases, potential suppliers must also complete a questionnaire, which E.ON evaluates carefully. Prequalification is mandatory for all new suppliers. The Human Rights and Supply Chain Management chapter provides more information on the supplier onboarding process.\n\nOur Know Your Counterparty ('KYC') principle also defines minimum requirements for certain business partners and scenarios, other than suppliers. The KYC check, which is part of the Group's large-scale digitalization strategy, is an IT-supported workflow that helps us verify counterparties' integrity and avoid legal, regulatory, and reputational risks related to compliance issues such as corruption, money-laundering, tax evasion, violation of economic sanctions, and terrorism financing. It is covered in our Know Your Counterparty People Guideline.\n\nE.ON is a member of a variety of compliance organizations. One example is the German Institute for Compliance (whose German acronym is DICO), where E.ON also serves as Chairman of DICO's Criminal Law Working Group and participates in the Internal Investigations and Whistleblower Systems working group. DICO's mission is to promote the role of compliance and the establishment of recognized compliance standards in corporate governance in Germany. The institute also serves as a networking platform for compliance experts in and outside Germany.\n\nThe Group Compliance and Data Protection department at E.ON SE conducted an interdisciplinary research project with the Max Weber Institute for Sociology at Heidelberg University, the Max Planck Institute for Human Development in Berlin, and its spinoff,\n\nSimply Rational GmbH. The project involved conducting surveys, training sessions, and intervention studies at E.ON companies in Germany to look into how altered situation assessments (interventions) can influence the acceptance and efficiency of preventive compliance measures and how their effectiveness and longevity can be measured. One finding was that the traditional medium of compliance knowledge transfer, training, has a measurable and lasting impact on participants' compliance awareness. Innovative, interactive teaching methods also create an awareness of the positive effects of structural measures like diversity promotion and job rotation among managers. The findings were presented to the E.ON Management Board, the Supervisory Board's Audit and Risk Committee, and the Groupwide compliance community in early 2024. The latter will take the insights into account when designing future compliance training and communications measures and actively put them into practice.\n\n## Goals and Performance Review\n\nWe continuously evaluate the CMS's effectiveness to ensure that E.ON is able to prevent, detect, and take appropriate remedial action against illegal or criminal conduct or other rules violations. The CMS's effectiveness is monitored by the E.ON Management Board, the Supervisory Board's Audit and Risk Committee, and also Group Audit. The latter, an independent entity, is the third line of defense of E.ON's CMS.\n\nThe CMS's effectiveness depends on how serious and credible our compliance efforts within the Company are. This is reflected by, for example, the resources we devote to compliance as well as the quality, control, and monitoring of our measures. Evaluating E.ON's compliance culture and the perception of its compliance is also relevant for the CMS's effectiveness. Special consideration is given to violations that lead to an internal audit. The audit determines whether a violation resulted from negligence or misconduct by an individual or individuals or from shortcomings in the CMS. We use the findings to implement measures to avoid similar incidents in future. The Management Board and the Supervisory Board's Audit and Risk Committee are convinced that",

Their assessment was based in part on audits as well as surveys of employees and stakeholders.\n\nThe CMS at E.ON is structured and follows a uniform roadmap with defined steps for refining our business units' compliance measures. All Compliance Officers must present the status of their unit's compliance roadmap regularly to their board and to Group Compliance. The implementation of the compliance roadmap in 2023 proceeded as planned.\n\nAs every year, in 2023 we asked employees who had contacted Group Compliance regarding Code of Conduct violations for feedback about their experiences. We used it to assess Group Compliance and Data Protection's readiness to address such violations or behaviors and to determine whether the information in our Group-wide People Guidelines is appropriate. The findings indicated that most respondents trust E.ON's compliance professionals and feel protected when reporting unethical behavior.\n\n## Progress and Measures\n\n\uf0d0\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Number of Compliance Notices\n\n|                                                                                                                                                                                               |   2023 |   2022 |   2021 |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Business integrity concerns,  such as potential illegal  activity, violation of law and  policy, corruption, antitrust,  business partner  compliance, and/or insider  trading in E.ON shares |     18 |     22 |     30 |\n| Fraud against the Company  concerns, such as theft,  embezzlement, and  occupational fraud                                                                                                    |     19 |     17 |     16 |\n| HR-related concerns, such  as conflict of interest,  mobbing, sexual  harassment, discrimination,  unfair employment  practices, and so forth                                                 |    126 |     57 |     48 |\n| Any other Code of Conduct- related topics                                                                                                                                                     |    129 |     41 |     66 |\n| Total                                                                                                                                                                                         |    292 |    137 |    160 |\n\nIn 2023 the number of compliance notices increased from 137 to 292. E.ON divides compliance notices into four categories: business integrity concerns, fraud against the Company concerns, HR-related concerns, and other concerns related to the Code of Conduct. The resulting investigations found that none of the incidents reported were serious.\n\n## Fines for Non-compliance\n\nE.ON paid a total of about \u20ac911,000 in fines for non-compliance with laws in 2023.\n\n## Energy Affordability\n\n\uf098\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGRI 3-3\n\nSince the war in Ukraine began, energy has increasingly played a role in geopolitics. This presents E.ON with more challenges\n\nalongside those posed by the energy transition. One thing is certain: the energy supply must remain reliable, secure, and affordable for industry and consumers. E.ON's long-standing approach is for its business to meet societal expectations regarding energy by pursuing three objectives simultaneously: climate protection, security of supply, and affordability. The public's interest, however, is shifting noticeably toward affordability. E.ON therefore advocates swift and decisive action by policymakers and the energy industry to ensure that energy remains available and affordable for all.\n\n## E.ON's Approach\n\nTo ensure fair prices for our customers and to be able to plan long term, we generally procure energy in advance. However, we cannot permanently insulate ourselves from market developments and must factor in all cost components into our pricing-both when these components fall and rise. Procurement prices on energy markets increased significantly in 2022. In comparison, markets eased considerably in 2023, but they still remain above the prewar level. This is now affecting our customers as well, who in some cases had to accept additional expenditures. E.ON therefore lowered its power and gas prices for a portion of customers in 2023 to the degree that and as soon as market conditions allowed.\n\nE.ON believes that it would be sensible to find a (social) policy solution or at least to initiate measures to support businesses and consumers in crisis situations in which the market is clearly out of balance. During the legislative process, E.ON called for the mechanisms to compensate gas and power suppliers to be as consistent, pragmatic, and legally secure as possible. In particular, liquidity risks and a high administrative workload should be avoided.\n\nThe dramatic developments necessitated rapid action by policymakers, above all to ensure secure and affordable supplies for industry and consumers. Taxes, levies, and surcharges still account for a large portion of energy costs. A reduction in energy taxes and levies remains sensible. Consumers in Germany should",

E.ON has long advocated both.\n\nIdeally, these options should be exhausted before market interventions to regulate prices are considered. It is important, however, to address the causes of market uncertainties. In the case of natural gas, a reduction in supply has been the primary factor since the beginning of the war in Ukraine. Policymakers in Germany are responding to this situation by creating additional gas supply capacity, in particular by importing liquefied natural gas ('LNG'), and by offering commercial and residential consumers (and gas-fired power plants) incentives to conserve energy. In the medium term, this can be remedied by more rapid renewables growth; in the short term, energy conservation is imperative.\n\nE.ON supports the measures enacted by German policymakers to reduce energy costs and has implemented them accordingly. For example, we endeavor that the government support payments foreseen in relief packages reach customers quickly. This included the German federal government's payment of heating bills for December 2022 as well as to the gas and electricity price caps, which took effect on March 1, 2023, retroactively for the period beginning January 1, 2023, and which E.ON fully implemented. Governments are enacting consumer assistance programs in other countries where E.ON operates. The Netherlands, for example, introduced a price cap for electricity and gas in January 2023, while variable standard tariffs were capped in the United Kingdom by the so-called Energy Price Guarantee. In these and other E.ON regions, we focus on designing customer-specific solutions and communicating openly so that our customers can identify what makes the most sense for them. In addition, we have taken steps for E.ON itself to conserve energy. 'Specific Actions' below contains more information.\n\n## Organization and Responsibilities\n\nE.ON responded quickly to the altered situation and established a variety of task forces at Corporate Functions and at some of its\n\nregional units to deal with the energy crisis. These task forces coordinate with each other on a regular basis regarding current developments and initiatives at the units.\n\nIn addition, initiatives are in place to share best practices and thus help the E.ON Group address the high prices faced by endcustomers. The regional units can implement the initiatives in a way that is tailored to their needs. The focus is on energy conservation, support for vulnerable customer groups, communications (with customers, employees, and the media), and the lobbying of policymakers. E.ON has already introduced several of the project's initiatives to support customers. For example, we have expanded the range of installment payment plans and cash payment vouchers. The latter option enables customers to pay in cash by means of QR code at places like supermarkets and gas stations. This makes it particularly easy for them to settle outstanding amounts.\n\n## Specific Actions\n\nWe want to provide our customers with effective and reliable assistance in dealing with their challenges. Our German sales units offer individual advice through a variety of channels (telephone, online, mail) and stay in touch with our customers. The energysaving advice and tips we offer on our website and other channels are important as well.\n\nOur customers in Germany can turn to the payment assistance team. It supports customers facing financial difficulties by working with them to find a suitable installment payment plan. One solution, for example, would provide installment payments without interest or fees.\n\nThis team also helps customers in financial emergencies. Its services include arranging contact with job centers, telephone debt counseling, and third-party debtor portals. We also explain to them how they can conserve energy effectively, what options are available for adjusting their payments, and how they can avoid high additional payments in the next annual bill. If customers\n\nencounter payment difficulties, we have always tried to work with them to find a mutually acceptable solution. Disconnection should always be the last resort. There is usually a lengthy process before a disconnection is announced or actually takes place. We dialogue extensively with customers who could potentially face a disconnection to prevent it from happening.\n\nSupport for vulnerable customers is based on their individual needs, the market situation, and the government programs available in different countries. This support is therefore the responsibility of the regional units. For example, their advisors help customers with payment difficulties find out whether they qualify for government support programs. They also check what opportunities are available from other organizations, such as obtaining prefinancing for insulation for a customer's home.\n\nWe think individually tailored advice is important: individual solutions are often more effective than a blanket incentive, such as a lump sum payment for everyone. Some people may be less interested in a cash benefit than others; instead, they are more likely interested in switching to renewables in the near future. For them and us, there are always good reasons to consider climate protection when making energy decisions: the transition to a climate-neutral energy supply independent of fossil fuels is essential. That is why our own short-term conservation measures are accompanied by efforts to use energy and heat at our facilities as efficiently as possible and to deploy smart technologies to progressively optimize energy consumption. We are also gradually converting our buildings to green electricity and heat and, wherever possible, installing solar panels to power them. In addition, we are optimizing building controls, exterior lighting, and heat systems, and using the flexible options of our hybrid working arrangements to reduce energy consumption. In general, we factor in the characteristics of our various facilities into our conservation measures and work to ensure that we systematically comply with all applicable occupational health and safety rules.",

E.ON's goal was therefore to reduce the energy consumption of its own buildings by 20 percent compared with a similar period in the previous year. Our sales companies in Germany achieved this by reducing their consumption in 2022 by about 23 percent relative to the prior year. Across all its facilities in Germany, E.ON limited the illumination of all non-essential light sources, such as logos and outdoor lighting, or to switch them off entirely. Room temperatures were reduced, and hot water was switched off where possible. A particularly effective measure was to shut down entire sections of a building and only heat them to a temperature at which the building and its infrastructure are not damaged, as was done at our main office buildings in Essen and Munich.\n\nEven before the current developments, E.ON had set a target of making the operation of its own buildings climate-neutral by 2030. The E.ON SE Management Board reaffirmed this target by reiterating its support for the CEO Alliance's Sustainable Corporate Building Climate Pledge. The CEO Alliance is an international, cross-sector coalition of the CEOs of 13 major European companies; its targeted projects are intended to help shape a more sustainable and resilient Europe. The aim of their Building Pledge is to make the operation of their corporate buildings climate-neutral by 2030 and to encourage other companies to join in.\n\n## Diversity and Inclusion\n\n\uf098\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGRI 3-3, GRI 405\n\nSociety is diverse. So is our workforce. At E.ON, people work together who are likewise diverse in many ways, including nationality, generation, gender, culture, religion, physical and mental abilities, sexual orientation and identity, as well as ethnic and social background. E.ON encourages and benefits from this diversity and creates an inclusive environment, because the interaction of people with different backgrounds, abilities, and\n\npersonalities results in good ideas. We want to become a diversity pacesetter, yet are aware that changing a corporate culture takes time. We are therefore tackling the issue step by step and would like to implement the necessary measures with conviction.\n\n## E.ON's Approach\n\nDiversity is one of the dimensions of E.ON's sustainability strategy and an essential aspect of our vision and values. We want to ensure equal opportunity for all our employees. Diversity is a prerequisite for creativity and innovation, and we therefore aim to take a targeted approach to promoting it. E.ON signed the German Diversity Charter in 2008, publicly affirming its long-standing commitment to a tolerant and inclusive corporate culture. The Company has been an active member since 2020. In 2023 we again participated in initiatives organized by the charter, such as those in conjunction with German Diversity Day. Our motto for the day was 'corporate networks.' Our Company intranet posted a list of diversity and inclusion networks for employees. We also published information and instructions on what a network is and how to set up one.\n\n## Guidelines and Policies\n\nThe E.ON Management Board and SE Works Council signed the Diversity and Inclusion Declaration in 2016. It pledges their commitment to creating a diverse and inclusive work environment that empowers all employees to realize their individual potential. Likewise in 2016, the Company, the SE Works Council, and the Group representation for severely disabled persons signed the Shared Understanding of Implementing Inclusion at E.ON, creating an important foundation for integrating people with disabilities into the Company.\n\n## Organization and Responsibilities\n\nE.ON views diversity as crucial for a successful work environment. The challenges vary by country. E.ON's approach to HR is mostly decentralized; each of our units therefore addresses diversity in its particular cultural context. This gives them the opportunity to meet challenges purposefully and to develop programs that reflect\n\nthe country or regions in which they operate. Diversity is managed by Group HR/Executive HR together with a network of HR professionals that meets face-to-face or virtually on a regular basis. Supported by Group HR/Executive HR, the E.ON Management Board is responsible for setting diversity targets for E.ON as a whole and its units. Some targets may reflect the laws of a particular country.\n\n## Specific Actions\n\nE.ON promotes diversity and equal opportunity through a variety of programs and networks, such as a mentoring program in Germany to prepare female employees for management positions. The Women@E.ON network aims to increase the visibility and influence of women at E.ON. In addition, the LGBT+ & Friends network promotes equality, diversity, and an inclusive work environment. Also, E.ON is a member in various initiatives, such as the Initiative Women into Leadership ('IWiL') and the European Round Table ('ERT').\n\nIn March 2021 the E.ON Management Board adopted measures to achieve more diversity and inclusion in the near term at E.ON in Germany. It also recommended that the measures be implemented, to the degree feasible, at E.ON units in other countries as well. One example is the promotion of co-leadership, in which two part-time executives share a leadership position, giving them greater flexibility in balancing their professional and private lives. Another flexible option is a part-time leadership position, in which an executive works at least 80 percent, with full time as an option. In addition, recruitment policies for management positions were adjusted so that at least one candidate on the shortlist is from the underrepresented gender. Other measures include diversity training for executives. Workshops on using inclusive language in job advertisements will also be conducted.\n\nThe E.ON Management Board continued its support for diversity networks in 2023. Management Board members serve as a",

Sponsor: Chief Operating Officer-Networks ('COO-N').\n\nIn 2023 the CEO Award for Diversity and Inclusion was conferred for the fifth time; the motto was 'making diversity and inclusion a priority at all levels.' The awards pay tribute to individuals (category: Leader in Role Modeling DEI) and initiatives (category: 'Innovation') at E.ON that strive to make a difference in diversity and inclusion. In 2023 the winners of the CEO Award for Diversity and Inclusion were chosen in a Group-wide vote. Oliver Henricks was honored in the Leader category. As a member of the Westenergie AG Management Board, he has proven to be an active supporter of the E.ON LGBT+ and Friends Network for Essen/Ruhr. He is also personally committed to the interests of employees with disabilities of all kinds. The CEO Award for Diversity and Inclusion in the Innovation category went to the enviaM Diversity Circle, an ongoing group that periodically holds (information) events. Its members are employees of different generations who, alongside their regular duties, are devoted to diversity and inclusion.\n\nIn 2023 E.ON and six other companies participated in the pilot phase of the Diversity Compass, which was initiated by the Stifterverband and the Charta der Vielfalt (Diversity Charter). The pilot's aim is to design structures, tools, and measures to include diverse groups of people in everyday working life to consider them in all Company areas and processes, and to firmly engrain\n\ndiversity, equity, and inclusion ('DE&I') in corporate culture. The project was supported by an outside process consultant. The Diversity Compass runs for about 15 to 18 months and will be completed in the second quarter of 2024.\n\nIn August 2023 E.ON was officially represented for the first time at the 20th Christopher Street Day in Essen, known as 'Ruhr Pride.' On this day, about 40 E.ON employees demonstrated our support for openness, diversity, and acceptance. Participation in Ruhr Pride was initiated by the LGBT+ & Friends corporate network.\n\nThe CEO Listening Tour, which was developed in 2021, continued in 2023 as well. This format is less about talking to employees and more about listening to them. The focus is on the work environment at E.ON, discrimination in the workplace, corporate networks, and many other topics. In 2023 the focus was on relocation within the E.ON Group and barrier-free, IT-supported work. The tour will continue in 2024.\n\nWe ran an in-house campaign on microaggression to mark International Day for Tolerance on November 16. It presented situations covering the various dimensions of diversity in a communicative manner and explained in detail the extent to which they can be considered microaggressions.\n\n## Goals and Performance Review\n\nE.ON SE and E.ON companies in Germany must comply with the German Law for the Equal Participation of Women and Men in Leadership Positions in the Private Sector and the Public Sector, which took effect on May 1, 2015. In February 2022 the E.ON Management Board set new target quotas for E.ON SE for the new implementation period beginning on July 1, 2022. The target quotas are 36 percent for the proportion of women occupying both the first and the second levels of management below the Management Board. The targets are to be met by June 30, 2027.The proportion of women occupying the first level of management below the Management Board was 23 percent at the\n\nend of the 2023 financial year, that of the second of management below the Management Board was 29 percent.\n\nThe E.ON SE Management Board has recommended to those E.ON Group companies that are legally obligated to set targets for the proportion of women on their supervisory board, management board, and the next two levels of management that they select ambitious targets that likewise should be met by June 30, 2027.\n\nIn addition, it was recommended that other relevant E.ON Group companies set appropriate quota targets even if they are not legally obligated to do so. The companies of the E.ON Group have heeded this recommendation. In addition, in 2021 E.ON set a voluntary Company-wide target that goes beyond statutory requirements. The target is to increase the proportion of women in management positions in all business units in all countries to at least 32 percent by year-end 2031. This figure corresponds to the proportion of women in E.ON's workforce at year-end 2021. Group HR monitors progress toward the target once a year and reports the findings to the E.ON Management Board. E.ON discloses the respective figures at year-end for the E.ON Group as a whole.\n\n## Share of Female Executives 1\n\n| Percentages   |   2023 |   2022 |   2021 |\n|---------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| E.ON Group    |     24 |     23 |     21 |\n\n1 Against the total number of managers.\n\nE.ON aims to provide equal pay to women and men for comparable jobs at all Group companies. Due to its decentralized management approach, E.ON does not collect data at the Group level or assess the pay gap (with the exception of the United Kingdom due to its legal requirements).",

This obliges us to ensure respect for human rights in all aspects of our business, including our supply chain. E.ON therefore expects its suppliers worldwide to meet minimum standards in their environmental, social, and governance ('ESG') performance, including in relation to human rights. E.ON assesses its suppliers' ESG performance prior to doing business with them and subject suppliers in higher-\n\nrisk countries or categories to greater scrutiny. In addition, E.ON aims to comply with the legal requirements for transparency along its supply chain, which in many countries are becoming increasingly more demanding, such as the Supply Chain Due Diligence Act in Germany ('Supply Chain Act').\n\n## E.ON's Approach\n\nE.ON takes its responsibilities seriously and is therefore committed to doing business in a compliant way, respecting human rights, protecting the environment, and ensuring proper work conditions. E.ON expects that its suppliers are likewise committed to high ESG standards and has processes in place to ensure that they do. Engaging in dialogue with stakeholders and participating in industry initiatives help us to pay particular attention to human rights issues. For example, E.ON is a member of econsense, a network of Germany-based multinational companies dedicated to promoting sustainable business development and respect for human rights. E.ON also participates in a working group at the German Compliance Institute DICO focusing on the same objectives. E.ON has been participating in the German Energy Sector Dialogue since January 2023, a multi-stakeholder dialogue that brings together the signatory companies, associations, trade unions, civil society organizations, the German Institute for Human Rights, and the German Federal Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs (German abbreviation: BMAS). The aim is to pool expertise and resources and to focus on the German energy industry's human rights and environmental risks along its global supply and value chains in order to improve the human rights and environmental situation.\n\nE.ON launched a Group-wide human rights due diligence project in the summer of 2022 to prepare the Company for the requirements of the Supply Chain Act. The project identified gaps, developed and implemented optimization measures, and designed a Group-wide approach to human rights management. The approach took effect on January 1, 2023, and assigns Group-wide management to the Human Rights Center of Expertise and the Chief Human Rights",

More information can be found below under 'Organization and Responsibilities.'\n\n## Guidelines and Policies\n\nTo prevent human rights violations, E.ON aims to always adhere to external standards and for this purpose has its own policies and guidelines. E.ON's Human Rights Statement, which was signed by all Management Board members and the Chief Human Rights Officer, is published on the E.ON website. The statement acknowledges the International Bill of Human Rights and the Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work of the International Labour Organization ('ILO') of the United Nations ('UN') and its fundamental conventions and provides an overview of our risks and measures taken. It also refers to E.ON's own guidelines, such as the Codes of Conduct for employees and suppliers. E.ON's Code of Conduct (more information can be found in the Compliance and Anticorruption chapter) obliges all employees to contribute to a non-discriminatory and safe work environment and to respect human rights. In addition, a People Guideline provides guidance to employees so that they procure goods and services in line with E.ON's ESG standards. The rules and regulations E.ON follows also include the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and the principles of the United Nations Global Compact ('UNGC'). E.ON has participated in the UNGC since 2005. Other guidelines and policies are the responsibility of the individual departments and support the implementation of suitable preventive measures for areas such as HSE and compliance. These are described in the chapters entitled Environmental Management, Occupational Health and Safety, and Compliance and Anticorruption.\n\nThe Supplier Code of Conduct defines standards for human rights, working conditions, environmental protection, and legally compliant, honest business practices that E.ON requires its suppliers to meet; it was updated on September 1, 2023, and applies to all suppliers. The current version is supplemented by additional requirements from the Supply Chain Act and stipulates the standards to be complied with in regard to fair working conditions in the supply chain and to climate protection.\n\nThe E.ON Supply Chain Function Policy describes the mandate and organizational setup of the Supply Chain function. The function encompasses the management of procurement processes, activities, policies, tools, and supplier relationships for all units to which the policy applies. In addition, the Function Policy (in conjunction with the Supply Chain Handbook) defines Group-wide principles, processes, and responsibilities for non-fuel procurement by the above-mentioned units. Excluded from this are the special cases on a specific list (for example energy and fuel procurement, financial and real estate transactions, and taxes).\n\n## Organization and Responsibilities\n\nThe role of Chief Human Rights Officer was previously held by the Chairman of the E.ON Management Board, Leonhard Birnbaum, who continues to serve as Chief Sustainability Officer and Chairman of the Sustainability Council. As part of the Group-wide human rights due diligence project, the task areas of the future Human Rights Officer were expanded in line with the Supply Chain Act, with a greater focus on legal aspects. In order to meet the associated new requirements, in January 2023 E.ON transferred the role to the General Counsel and Chief Compliance Officer. He is the new Chief Human Rights Officer and thus responsible for monitoring our human rights risk management system and reports on this to the Management Board on a regular basis. He is also a permanent member of the Sustainability Council. Staff in the Sustainability department and the Legal Affairs, Compliance and Security division deal with human rights issues, such as changes in legislation. Depending on the issue, the Chief Human Rights Officer can involve the Sustainability Council or the E.ON Management Board.\n\nA new task area, the Human Rights Center of Expertise, was created as part of the human rights due diligence project. It assumed the completed project's tasks from the summer of 2023 onward. The center, which is part of the Sustainability & Climate department, ensures that legal requirements are fulfilled across all divisions and units. Furthermore, it implements and maintains our human rights risk management system, conducts periodic risk analyses of our own business as well as our supply chain, and reports on them. It is\n\nalso responsible for Group-wide complaints management and exchanges information with external stakeholders on topics relevant to human rights. In addition, it keeps the Chief Human Rights Officer informed about current developments and incidents and advises him on upcoming activities and decisions.\n\nAll employees of Group units are responsible for ensuring that requirements are met at our own company. The Supply Chain division, on the other hand, deals with the full range of ESG aspects along the supply chain. It carries out the related tasks in observance of legal requirements as well as company policies, including HSE and sustainability standards.\n\n## Risk Management pursuant to the Supply Chain Act\n\nWe conduct periodic and ad hoc risk analyses for our own business and for our supply chain in order to identify human rights and environmental risks at an early stage. The analyses have two stages. First, we use publicly available indicators and sources to assess the human rights and environmental risks defined by the Supply Chain Act. Examples include the Global Rights Index of the International Trade Union Confederation ('ITUC') and the Human Development Report of the United Nations Development Programme ('UNDP'). We adopt a risk-based approach that includes both country and industry risks. We also consider risks associated with specific procurement categories and use a digital solution for ongoing risk assessment of our own facilities as well as our suppliers. Our own facilities will be integrated into this digital solution starting in 2024. In addition, risk analysis incorporates information received through our complaints process. Then we identify how we can reduce the risk potential by means of our existing measures and, finally, prioritize the specific risks. As part of risk analyses conducted on a regular basis, we have prioritized identified risks for our own facilities and for our supply chain. For our own business, we have identified occupational health and safety as a risk inherent in our industry and thus as a priority risk for us. The associated preventive measures are described in the Environmental Management and Occupational Health and Safety chapters. For our suppliers and our deeper value chain, we have",

We established a focus group for our solar and battery supply chains. It consists of experts from the Procurement, Sales, and Sustainability departments and provides closer support for these supply chains. We also address the issue in industry initiatives like Solar Power Europe.\n\n## Supply Chain Management\n\nOur supply chain management for non-fuel suppliers, to which the following remarks refer, consists of various preventive measures that are interlinked and accompany the supplier in the procurement process. They are fine-tuned on a regular basis and described below:\n\nThe onboarding process for suppliers is carried out before a contract is signed. Its steps include self-registration by the supplier, a formal pledge to comply with the E.ON Supplier Code of Conduct, and a compliance check. Every non-fuel supplier whose individual transaction volume exceeds \u20ac25,000 must complete this process. Non-fuel suppliers that are not subject to supplier onboarding must agree to E.ON's General Terms and Conditions for Purchase Contracts, which are legally binding. These oblige non-fuel suppliers, among other things, to comply with the minimum standards of our Supplier Code of Conduct.\n\nThis approach's purpose is to minimize potential HSE and CSR risks. As of year-end 2023, 97.4 percent of non-fuel suppliers had completed the onboarding process. New suppliers are asked by the manager responsible for their product or service category to register using the supplier onboarding solution. Depending on the transaction volume and HSE risk, suppliers must answer one or more questionnaires. In certain cases, E.ON may take additional steps. These include a supplier audit to check whether the supplier complies with E.ON's standards for human rights, working conditions, and environmental protection. E.ON may also require a supplier to have in place an environmental management system certified to ISO 14001 or Eco-Management and Audit Scheme ('EMAS') III or a health and safety management system certified to ISO 45001. Suppliers that participate in tenders as part of a public procurement\n\nact do not use the above-described process but instead follow the qualification procedures required under their country's laws.\n\nBuilding on the assessment procedures introduced in 2018, in the year under review E.ON continued to evaluate its suppliers' performance and, based on the findings, make decisions about its relationship with them. Alongside onboarding, E.ON determines annually which of its non-fuel suppliers it deems material; E.ON evaluates them on the basis of five KPIs: quality, commercial aspects, delivery, innovation, and corporate sustainability, including human rights. E.ON discusses the results with its suppliers in feedback meetings. During this meeting, E.ON also decides whether it will require a supplier to take specific improvement measures if the business relationship is to be maintained.\n\nThe human rights due diligence check introduced in 2021 is based on a human rights risk matrix that combines the risks of the different categories of goods and services E.ON procures with the risks of the countries in which suppliers operate. Since being updated in 2023 the matrix covers all of E.ON's procurement categories. Potentially risky suppliers first had to pass additional checks, such as a more detailed questionnaire or audit, and agree to make improvements and provide evidence of their implementation. In 2023, more than 3,600 new and existing suppliers answered the questionnaire. Many high-risk suppliers successfully completed the human rights due diligence check. Suppliers that have difficulty answering the questionnaire or providing evidence of their measures are supported and closely monitored.\n\nIn the second quarter of 2022 E.ON began introducing a digital solution for ongoing risk assessment of suppliers with medium and high human rights risk. They are assessed in a variety of categories, including sustainability, finance, cybersecurity, supply chain disruption, and compliance. The digital solution looks at several elements called points of interest ('PoIs'): the holding company of suppliers, branches, plant locations, and logistics routes. Since the program's introduction, over 3,800 PoIs have been monitored on an ongoing basis, thereby covering 60 percent\n\nof E.ON's annual spend. Nevertheless, E.ON is aware that the complexity of international supply chains poses a challenge to transparency. E.ON is therefore also active in industry initiatives to develop industry-specific standards for improved transparency in supply chains, as described above under 'E.ON's Approach' and in the ESG Materiality and Stakeholder Engagement chapter.\n\n## Specific Actions\n\n## Multistage Supplier Analysis\n\nIn 2023 we conducted a multistage analysis of various product categories, including transformers, inverters, solar systems, batteries, and circuit breakers. The analysis was not only of end products, but also preliminary stages, including electronic components as well as chemicals and raw materials used.\n\nThe findings indicated clear differences between product categories and thus provided important insights for future measures to improve sustainability at the product and supplier level. Overall, the analysis makes an important contribution to enhancing E.ON Supply Chain's environmental and social responsibility.\n\n## Decarbonization\n\nA first step toward decarbonizing supply chains is to make the current CO2 emissions of purchased goods and services more transparent. In 2022 E.ON therefore conducted a heatmap analysis of the greenhouse gas emissions in its supply chains based on third-party emissions factors and cost-based data. We will repeat the analysis on an annual basis. In 2023 the analysis included taking a closer look at lower-emissions metals and sulfur hexafluoride ('SF6') gas. More information on our reduction efforts can be found in the Climate Protection chapter.\n\n## Training\n\nE.ON continually improves its eLearning tools for employees, such as the annual Web training module on human rights, compliance, and cyber and data security, which was updated in September",

More than 80 percent of employees had completed the module by the end of 2023.\n\nIn addition, E.ON trained about 320 Supply Chain employees on respect for human rights along the supply chain, new aspects of onboarding, and E.ON's risk matrix for human rights.\n\n## Goals and Performance Review\n\nE.ON's objective is to avoid violations of human rights, environmental standards, and its corporate principles. For this purpose, E.ON endeavors to identify the relevant risks along its value chain. Periodic risk assessments can help E.ON detect actual or suspected violations. If violations occur, the Supply Chain Compliance Officer and the respective Supply Chain Director are notified immediately and corrective measures are demanded from the supplier. Implementation is precisely monitored by E.ON. If the situation does not improve, E.ON terminates its business relationship with the supplier. No business relationships were terminated for this reason in 2023.\n\nEmployees can report possible violations of human rights through internal reporting channels and a Group-wide, IT-supported, external Whistleblower hotline. The hotline service, which is published on the Internet, can take calls in the official languages of all countries in which E.ON operates. Not only E.ON employees, but also business partners, their employees, and other third parties can contact the hotline, anonymously if they wish. The information is forwarded to the responsible department at Corporate Functions. Depending on the type and severity of the potential violation, the Compliance department immediately reports it to the E.ON Management Board, files criminal charges, initiates its own investigation, or takes other measures. In 2023 the Whistleblower system was used to report four potential human rights violations. The investigation found that the allegations were not a violation of human rights or E.ON's Code of Conduct.\n\n## Excursus: Biomass\n\nE.ON is committed to procuring the fuel for its biomass-fired assets responsibly and sustainably. Suppliers of solid biomass must, like non-fuel suppliers, contractually agree to comply with our Supplier Code of Conduct. Until March 2023, the E.ON Biomass Purchasing Amendment from 2010 defined our policies and procedures, which include risk assessments, supplier audits, and provisions for joint ventures. Effective March 2023, we redefined the terms for the purchase of solid biomass for our Energy Infrastructure Solutions ('EIS') business and thus replaced the former Biomass Purchasing Amendment. The purpose of the new rules is to ensure that all relevant units act in accordance with applicable EU regulations and meet E.ON's sustainability standards when procuring and using solid biomass for their business activities. All biomass suppliers must pledge to respect human rights, safeguard the general living conditions of persons affected by biomass production, and protect biodiversity and the environment.\n\nA large proportion of our biomass capacity is installed in Sweden. E.ON Energiinfrastruktur AB operates district heating businesses in \u00d6rebro, N\u00f6rrk\u00f6ping, and parts of Stockholm and Malm\u00f6. Since 2014, E.ON has assessed the CSR performance of its suppliers there using a method developed by E.ON Energiinfrastruktur AB. In addition, key requirements for biomass suppliers-such as the Supplier Code of Conduct and compliance with the EU Renewable Energy Directive II ('RED II ') -have been integral to contracts with suppliers since 2021. In 2022 E.ON introduced an expanded inhouse assessment of sustainability-related risks and applied it in 2023 as well.\n\n## Uranium Procurement\n\nOwing to legislation amended in 2022, E.ON subsidiary PreussenElektra continued to operate Isar 2 nuclear power plant until April 15, 2023, after which the plant stopped producing electricity. No additional fuel had to be procured for extended operations. PreussenElektra stopped procuring uranium in 2020.\n\n## Tax \uf0d0\n\n## GRI 3-3\n\nE.ON considers good corporate governance to consist primarily of responsible and value-oriented management. This also includes having a transparent tax strategy. E.ON's tax strategy and corporate strategy are closely aligned. The aim is to manage the Company's taxes sustainably in order to help ensure that it continues to invest, to operate flexibly and efficiently, and to provide attractive dividends to shareholders. E.ON's tax strategy is therefore designed to be fully compliant with tax law. It ensures that management of E.ON's taxation is efficient, responsible, transparent, and accurate, both for the Group as a whole and in individual tax jurisdictions.\n\n## E.ON's Approach\n\nE.ON is aware of its social responsibility regarding its significance as a tax payer. It aims for full tax compliance and adheres to all national and international tax legislation and standards. E.ON also has in place policies and procedures to prevent tax evasion. This includes the obligation of all employees to report any suspicions or concerns to their supervisor, Group Tax, their unit's Tax function, Group Compliance, or the Whistleblower hotline; if they wish, they may do so anonymously (for more information about the hotline, see the Compliance and Anticorruption chapter).\n\n## Guidelines and Policies\n\nE.ON's tax function encompasses Group Tax as well as the units' Tax departments. It actively and continually identifies, assesses, and monitors tax risks to make sure that the Company's tax practices are in line with its strategic objectives. To achieve this and to ensure appropriate responses to risks, E.ON has in place a governance framework, which includes a Tax Function Policy. The framework and policy were approved by the E.ON Management Board and are mandatory for all Group companies. They are embedded into E.ON's overall compliance management system and supplemented by comprehensive risk control management procedures, continual self-assessment as well as regular internal",

The Tax function has also published the aforementioned tax strategy.\n\nE.ON does not make use of jurisdictions publicly identified as noncooperative-also know as tax oases-to reduce its effective tax burden. E.ON does not relocate any business activities in low-tax jurisdictions with the primary goal of thereby achieving lower taxation. E.ON does not use any aggressive tax-reducing structures, particularly no structures that lack a business reason or motive. E.ON's tax planning always adopts the principle of complying with both letter and the spirit of the law.\n\nE.ON has issued a binding Group-wide Transfer Pricing Policy to ensure that intra-Group transactions are conducted in accordance with the arm's-length principle. This principle of international tax law states that the transfer prices of cross-border transactions between Group units, including all ownership interests above 25 percent, must be set as they would be in a comparable transaction between independent third parties in an external market. Group Tax is responsible for monitoring adherence to the arm's-length principle and is involved in all major intra-Group transactions. It does this through various means, including regular meetings with relevant E.ON business units and functions as well as fixed Groupwide transfer pricing processes. In addition, participants from relevant business units and functions (in Germany and elsewhere) meet at least once a year to align cross-border intra-Group transactions to meet operational as well as tax requirements. Transfer pricing processes are monitored on an ongoing basis.\n\n## Organization and Responsibilities\n\nThe E.ON Management Board has overall responsibility for the Group's corporate strategy, which includes managing and monitoring the tax function. It has delegated the responsibility for this function to the Senior Vice President ('SVP') Group Tax, who reports directly to the Chief Financial Officer. The heads of the Tax departments in Germany and other countries report directly to Group Tax as well as to their unit's management board. Furthermore, E.ON SE has appointed a Tax Compliance Officer\n\n('TCO'), whose role is to ensure that the existing tax compliance management system is effective and efficient. The TCO reports directly to the SVP Group Tax. Additionally, local tax compliance management systems were put in place at the level of independent tax groups in Germany and other countries.\n\nThe SVP Group Tax defines E.ON's tax principles, and is responsible for ensuring that these principles and concomitant procedures are in place, maintained, and complied with Groupwide. He reports to the E.ON Supervisory Board's Audit and Risk Committee on tax-related issues and risks. In addition, financial tax risks are reported to Group Controlling and Risk, which examines these risks from a Group perspective and prepares reports for the consolidated risk assessment of the E.ON Group. The tax function disseminates guidelines and policies to ensure tax compliance, including related tasks, processes, and responsibilities. E.ON has in place tax compliance management systems according to IDW audit standard PS 980 at its major operations in Germany. The systems' purpose is to identify and classify all material tax risks and to map the findings in a detailed risk control matrix ('RCM'). The RCMs are continually updated and maintained.\n\n## Specific Actions\n\nE.ON's tax function takes a variety of steps to stay on top of new developments. Teams and managers hold meetings at various intervals (weekly, biweekly, or monthly) to discuss emerging tax issues. E.ON's tax experts also meet at slightly longer intervals (monthly, quarterly, or annually) to discuss country-specific and international tax issues. These meetings, which take place both physically and virtually, promote continuous collaboration and coordination between Group Tax and the units' Tax departments. In addition, Tax teams and managers also receive in-house training. E.ON strives to continually improve processes, particularly by deploying and using digital solutions that ensure tax compliance while enhancing efficiency. Our digital solutions include an integrated toolset that calculates income tax for quarterly and annual financial statements and tax returns. Tax tools are updated on a regular basis to reflect changes in tax laws. This enables us to\n\nensure that our calculations always comply with the law. Where reasonable, we implement software interfaces to ensure data integrity and to minimize the risk of manual errors.\n\nE.ON employees participate in a variety of working groups and committees of trade associations, such as the Federation of German Industries (German abbreviation: 'BDI'), the German Association of Energy and Water Industries (German abbreviation: 'BDEW'), and Chambers of Commerce. This enables them to contribute to the discussion on new tax legislation as well (for more information on E.ON's work in associations, see the ESG Materiality and Stakeholder Engagement chapter).\n\n## Goals and Performance Review\n\nE.ON and its tax function place great emphasis on maintaining transparent and mutual communications with the tax authorities in the countries where the Company does operates. We prepare and file all required tax returns and pay the correct amount of tax on time and adopt the principle of complying with both letter and the spirit of the law. We seek advice from independent experts to clarify matters of doubt and uncertainties.\n\nTo achieve a higher level of certainty, E.ON regularly discusses binding tax rulings or advance pricing agreements ('APA') with tax authorities if this is possible, expedient, and of general or economic importance to E.ON. Our aim is to prevent subsequent disagreements between the tax authorities of different states and our business units.\n\nE.ON partners with external tax experts that help it supervise company audits and prepare tax returns and declarations as well as tax payments. The collaboration with external partners is based on open, mutually trustful communications. Each partner performs its own independent quality assurance, which, in the aggregate, leads to adequate quality checks. E.ON constantly aims for certainty in its tax positions and, where appropriate, obtains internal or external advice to verify and validate its positions. In case our assessment does not match that of the tax authorities, we communicate the divergent opinion openly in order to prevent misunderstandings.",

Sustainable energy is not essential for propelling economic and social development, but a key factor in tackling climate change. Meeting the global challenges of climate change will require that the financial system changes so that it promotes sustainable businesses and climate-friendly solutions. E.ON's ambitious climate targets set it on an emissions-reduction path that is systematically aligned with the new energy world. Sustainability is at the core of our corporate strategy and is also the guiding principle for our actions. Our strategy accords with the European Union's decarbonization agenda and the EU Green Deal. Energy networks-one of E.ON's core businesses-are the platform for Europe's energy transition. Our investment program therefore aims to be largely aligned with the EU taxonomy. More than half of our funding needs will be met by the issuance of green bonds. Our strategy thus also reflects capital markets' increasing interest in sustainable investments. \u25c4\n\n## EU Taxonomy\n\n\uf09a\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## General Principles\n\nThe European Commission's action plan on financing sustainable growth defined a series of measures to channel capital toward environmentally sustainable activities and thus to help enable the European Union to become climate-neutral by 2050 as foreseen by the European Green Deal. The Commission laid the foundation for this in Regulation 2020/852, the EU Taxonomy Regulation, which describes what is considered an 'environmentally sustainable activity', and which criteria are used to classify an economic activity as environmentally sustainable. The aim is to classify economic activities EU-wide on the basis of defined requirements with regard to their contribution to the six defined environmental objectives (Article 9 of the EU taxonomy) and thus to support the European Union's transformation to a climate and environmentally friendly economy. The six objectives are:\n\n- 1. Climate change mitigation\n- 2. Climate change adaptation\n- 3. The sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources\n- 4. The transition to a circular economy\n- 5. Pollution prevention and control\n- 6. The protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems\n\nArticle 3 of the EU taxonomy defines economic activities as environmentally sustainable if they:\n\n- \u00b7 contribute substantially to at least one of six environmental objectives (Articles 10 to 16)\n- \u00b7 do no significant harm to any of the other five environmental objectives (Article 17)\n- \u00b7 comply with minimum standards for occupational safety, human rights, anti-corruption, fair competition, and taxation (Article 18)\n- \u00b7 comply with technical screening criteria defined by the European Commission\n\nFor the 2023 financial year and, for the first time, all six environmental objectives are to be considered for the question of a substantial contribution. Sets of criteria are available for defining the substantial contribution toward achieving the objectives. In the 2022 and 2021 financial years, these sets of criteria were only available for the first two environmental objectives.\n\nKnown as technical screening criteria ('TSC'), they specify which economic activities are considered taxonomy-aligned. Reporting on the taxonomy-alignment of economic activities with regard to\n\nenvironmental objectives 3 to 6 is only mandatory for the 2024 financial year onward; reporting on taxonomy-eligibility is required for the 2023 financial year.\n\nAn economic activity makes a substantial contribution to environmental objective 1, 'Climate change mitigation,' if it contributes substantially to the stabilization of greenhouse-gas ('GHG') concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that prevents dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system, consistent with the Paris Agreement's long-term temperature target through the avoidance or reduction of GHG emissions.\n\nEconomic activities that contribute to environmental objective 2, 'Climate change adaptation,' include or provide solutions that either avoid or substantially reduce the risk of the adverse impacts of the current and the future climate on the economic activity itself or on people, nature, or assets.\n\nEconomic activities that achieve or maintain good environmental status for all water and marine resources make a significant contribution to environmental objective 3, 'sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources.'\n\nEnvironmental objective 4, 'Transition to a circular economy,' focuses on economic activities that contribute to promoting the efficient use of resources through reuse and recycling.\n\nEconomic activity that eliminates pollution of air, water, soil, living organisms, and food resources makes a significant contribution to environmental objective 5, 'Pollution prevention and control.'\n\nEconomic activities that reflect the need to protect, conserve, or restore biodiversity or to maintain or restore ecosystems to a good condition contribute to environmental objective 6, 'Protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems.'\n\nE.ON has been required beginning with the 2021 financial year to disclose the proportion of investments, revenues, and operating",

Activities are taxonomy-eligible if they are described in principle in Annexes I and II to the Delegated Act on environmental objectives and can be assigned, regardless of whether the corresponding TSC for environmentally sustainable activities are met.\n\nIn addition to the information required by law, E.ON voluntarily disclosed its taxonomy-aligned investments, revenues, and operating expenditures for the 2021 financial year. Activities are taxonomy-aligned if the corresponding taxonomy-eligible activities also meet all the criteria in Article 3 of the EU Taxonomy. These disclosures have been mandatory since 2022.\n\nThe European Commission has defined taxonomy criteria for various economic activities under which conditions these activities make a substantial contribution to at least one of the environmental objectives and, at the same time, do not significantly harm the achievement of the EU's five other environmental objectives. However, the criteria's provisions, formulations, and terms are still subject to uncertainties of interpretation. The following presents our interpretation of the sets of criteria.\n\nIn early March 2022 the European Commission published a supplementary Delegated Taxonomy Act on the environmental objectives 1, 'climate change mitigation,' and 2, 'climate change adaptation.' It now defines criteria for other economic activities under which investments in gas and nuclear power activities can be classified as environmentally sustainable. This is intended to accelerate the transition toward a carbon-neutral future characterized predominantly by renewable energy sources. Application of the supplementary act has been mandatory since the 2022 financial year.\n\nRegarding nuclear energy, E.ON has come to the conclusion, based on a comprehensive review, that the temporary continued operation of Isar 2 nuclear power plant until April 2023, did not fall\n\nunder any of the activities described in the supplementary delegated act. Activity 4.28 also does not apply to power generation in the last reactor unit still operated by PreussenElektra, since the decision made by the German federal government to temporarily extend operations does not correspond to an extension of the plant's operation within the meaning of the criteria of 4.28.\n\nThe sets of criteria for generating electricity, heat, and/or cooling from fossil gas are fundamentally relevant for E.ON. E.ON installs and operates plants that are taxonomy-aligned within the meaning of the EU's new gas economic activities. E.ON did not, or did not fully, meet the criteria for taxonomy alignment in the 2023 financial year.\n\nIn June 2023, as part of the sustainable finance package, the European Commission published the Delegated Taxonomy Act on environmental objectives 3 to 6 ('Sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources,' 'Transition to a circular economy,' 'Pollution prevention and control,' and 'Protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems'). At the same time, it published amendments to the delegated act on the first two environmental objectives and the delegated act on disclosure. The amendments include additional economic activities, adjustments to some DNSH criteria, and changes resulting from the publication of the delegated act on environmental objectives 3 to 6.\n\nThe economic activities described in the Delegated Act on environmental objectives 3 to 6 are, comparatively, not relevant for E.ON as an energy company. At the present time, only the activities listed in environmental objective 3 relating to water supply and municipal wastewater treatment (2.1 and/or 2.2), which are likewise covered by environmental objectives 1 and 2 (activities 5.1 and 5.2, and/or 5.3 and 5.4), fall within E.ON's business activities. To avoid double counting, we continue to assign the economic activities to environmental objective 1, 'Climate change mitigation.' This confirms the significant\n\ncontribution that E.ON's business model makes to climate protection.\n\nOf the activities relevant to E.ON as a whole, the following activities are of particular importance. By conducting them the Group makes a substantial contribution to climate change mitigation and/or to the sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources:\n\n- \u00b7 Distribution of electricity\n- \u00b7 Distribution networks for renewable and low-carbon gases\n- \u00b7 Data-driven solutions for GHG emissions reductions\n- \u00b7 Construction, extension and operation of water collection, treatment and supply systems\n- \u00b7 Installation, maintenance and repair of instruments and devices for measuring, regulation and controlling energy performance of buildings\n- \u00b7 Cogeneration of heat/cool and power from bioenergy\n- \u00b7 Power generation by means of photovoltaic technology\n- \u00b7 District-heating distribution\n- \u00b7 Infrastructure for personal mobility\n- \u00b7 Generation of heat/cooling from renewable non-fossil gaseous and liquid fuels\n\nE.ON reports on activities that already contribute to the environmental objectives or are activities that enable climate protection or represent transition activities.",

E.ON is an energy company, and thus, its activities in these segments are extensively covered by the economic activities listed in the EU taxonomy.\n\nThe figures for taxonomy-relevant economic activities were determined with reference to the FAQ documents published by the European Commission to date, which address questions of interpretation regarding Article 8 of the EU Taxonomy Regulation, and under application of the amendments to the Delegated Act on disclosure of taxonomy requirements published in 2023.\n\n## E.ON's Approach\n\nE.ON has had a regular process in place since 2021 to ensure the appropriate assessment of all taxonomy requirements related to the EU's environmental objectives 1, 'Climate change mitigation,' and 2, 'Climate change adaptation.' The approach also applies to the taxonomy requirements to be considered for the first time in 2023 in relation to EU environmental objectives 3 to 6 ('Sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources,' 'Transition to a circular economy,' 'Pollution prevention and control,' and 'Protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems'). E.ON's business activities are continually mapped to the relevant taxonomy criteria. We consider revenues to be the main criterion; that is, E.ON's activities are allocated to the taxonomy's economic activity with which revenues are or are supposed to be generated. The next step is an alignment check in which the mapping's finding are analyzed and checked in interviews, expert discussions, and workshops with the relevant operational contacts and experts from the specialist departments of the segments and business units as well as major Group companies to determine whether corresponding taxonomy criteria for the economic activities are actually met. The check's findings are documented for any taxonomy-relevant economic activities identified. This documentation is collated in an EU taxonomy manual that is binding for all E.ON companies. The companies use the manual's specifications to determine the extent to which their\n\n- business activities actually meet the taxonomy's technical screening criteria and create suitable records for this purpose.\n\nE.ON conducts the analysis of taxonomy-alignment in detail as follows:\n\n## Assessment of Substantial Contribution\n\nCompliance with the technical screening criteria is generally assessed and documented individually for each economic activity and at the companies on a decentralized basis. If the criteria provide for simplifications that allow compliance with the criteria to be assessed at the level of the entire economic activity, an operating segment, or for the entire Group, E.ON makes use of them.\n\n## Assessment of Doing No Significant Harm ('DNSH')\n\nThe DNSH criteria mainly refer to compliance with legal requirements or, in the case of the 'circular economy' objective, to fundamental aspects of the economic activity. DNSH conformity is therefore to be assessed at the level of an economic activity on a regular basis. DNSH conformity regarding EU environmental objective 2, 'Climate change adaptation,' is identified and assessed in E.ON's established risk management process. For this purpose, E.ON makes use of existing systems and processes for financial and non-financial risk management, which it has expanded to include EU taxonomy matters. Details can be found in the Risks and Chances Report.\n\n## Assessments of Minimum Safeguards\n\nE.ON uses established processes and documentation at the Group level to assess and comply with the minimum safeguards. The Group ensures that the EU taxonomy's requirements are fully met in this regard by means of appropriate guidelines and related training and monitoring measures. E.ON companies are required to implement such policies and guidelines in a binding manner.\n\nResponsibility for compliance lies with the respective companies.\n\n## Taxonomy-Aligned Economic Activities\n\nThe assessment included a review of all activities relevant for E.ON to determine whether they make a substantial contribution to climate change mitigation (and/or to the sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources) and meet the criteria contained in Article 3 of the EU taxonomy. The review identified the following economic activities as taxonomy-aligned on a proportional basis:\n\n- 4.1 Electricity generation using solar photovoltaic technology\n- 4.3 Electricity generation from wind power\n- 4.5 Electricity generation from hydropower\n- 4.9 Transmission and distribution of electricity\n- 4.10  Electricity storage\n- 4.14   Transmission and distribution networks for renewable and low-carbon gases\n- 4.15   District heating/cooling distribution\n- 4.16  Installation and operation of electric heat pumps\n- 4.19  Cogeneration of heating/cooling and power from renewable non-fossil gaseous and liquid fuels\n- 4.20   Cogeneration of heating/cooling and power from bioenergy\n- 4.21  Production of heating/cooling from solar thermal energy\n- 4.23  Production of heating/cooling from renewable non-fossil gaseous and liquid fuels\n- 4.24   Production of heating/cooling from bioenergy",

If economic activities make a significant contribution to environmental objective 1, 'Climate change mitigation,' as well as to environmental objective 3, 'The sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources,' we assign the more significant contribution to climate change mitigation.\n\n## Substantial Contribution to Climate Change Mitigation\n\nBy definition, electricity generation from wind and solar as well as run-of-river hydropower plants makes a substantial contribution to climate change mitigation within the meaning of the taxonomy. No other criteria for the assessment of their substantial contribution to climate protection need to be assessed. The same applies to the installation of devices such as solar panels, smart energy meters, and electric-vehicle charging stations in buildings.\n\nE.ON's activities to establish infrastructure for personal eMobility meet the required criteria for creating low-carbon road transport.\n\nE.ON's electricity networks make a substantial contribution to climate change mitigation within the meaning of the taxonomy, since they are downstream distribution networks, and thus part of the European interconnected system.\n\nE.ON operates a large number of heating networks. This activity is in principle taxonomy-eligible. Some of these heating networks are 'efficient' within the meaning of the taxonomy's criteria. This means that they transmit at least 50 percent renewable heat, at least 50 percent waste heat, at least 75 percent CHP heat, or at least 50 percent of a combination of these energy sources. Such heating networks thus make a substantial contribution to climate protection.\n\nIn addition, E.ON operates water supply systems, the majority of which make a substantial contribution to climate change mitigation because they meet the energy-efficiency criterion (less than 0.5 kWh per cubic meter of water) and/or the leakage threshold of 1.5. For water supply systems that do not meet these criteria, investments made in the financial year to improve their energy efficiency and/or leakage rate by at least 20 percent are classified as taxonomy-aligned investments. The significant contribution to the sustainable use and protection of marine resources is made through the operation of water supply systems that provide consumers with high water quality and at the same time contribute to the efficiency of water resources. These water supply systems revenues are classified as taxonomy-aligned if the investments enabled them to meet the aforementioned criteria for taxonomy-aligned water supply systems.\n\nIn the case of gas networks, in particular investments in existing infrastructure that increase the possibility of blending hydrogen and other low-carbon gases were classified as taxonomy-aligned. Pilot projects to establish dedicated hydrogen infrastructure were also assessed to be taxonomy-aligned. This also applies to investments and operating expenses related to the detection and/or prevention of methane leaks.\n\nE.ON operates a large number of CHP and heat generation plants. Depending on the energy source used, there are various sets of criteria, some of which are met by E.ON plants. Plants fueled solely by natural gas will be classified as taxonomy-eligible under the new sets of criteria but are not classified as taxonomy-aligned at present.\n\nInvestments in the development of broadband data infrastructure are classified as taxonomy-aligned because the data and analyses provided by them lead directly to the reduction of GHG emissions at E.ON or its customers.\n\n## Do No Significant Harm\n\nProtecting assets against the physical impacts of climate change ('Climate change adaptation') is economically relevant for E.ON and is therefore factored into investment decisions. Climaterelated risks and opportunities are also recorded in E.ON's risk management system. The Risks and Chances Report contains more information.\n\nThe criteria for the EU's environmental objective 3, 'sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources,' mainly refer to legal and regulatory requirements in the energy sector. Compliance with these requirements is a prerequisite for obtaining construction and operating permits. The same applies in principle to the criteria for the EU's environmental objective 5, 'pollution prevention and control.' Details can be found in the Environmental Management chapter.\n\nThere are general criteria for the environmental objective 4, 'transition to a circular economy,' such as long durability, easy disassembly, or reparability. Most components are designed for a very long lifespan, are recyclable, and still have economic value at the end of their useful life (such as steel, aluminum, and copper). Such components of assets can be recycled within the E.ON Group or sold to third parties for further use.",

Furthermore, one of E.ON's important ambitions is to conduct ecological corridor management or to convert to this approach.\n\n## Compliance with the Minimum Safeguards\n\nE.ON is committed to respecting human rights in all business processes. To prevent human rights violations, E.ON adheres to external standards and defines its own principles and policies. E.ON's Human Rights Policy Statement explicitly acknowledges the United Nations' International Bill of Human Rights and the International Labour Organization's Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work and the latter's fundamental conventions. The statement also makes reference to E.ON's own policies, such as the Supplier Code of Conduct and the Code of Conduct for employees. The standards for human rights, work conditions, environmental protection, and compliant business practices that E.ON requires its suppliers to meet are defined in the Supplier Code of Conduct.\n\nConducting a periodic risk assessment serves to indicate potential threats. E.ON promotes compliance with its standards and minimize potential threats by means of numerous measures and processes. The principle focus of these activities at E.ON's own business is on occupational safety and fair work conditions. Additional information about the assurance of a responsible supply chain, compliance and anti-corruption, and tax is contained in the chapters on these topics.\n\n## EU Taxonomy Key Figures\n\nE.ON's reporting applies the indicators defined in Article 8 of the Taxonomy Regulation: taxonomy-eligible and taxonomy-aligned investments, revenues, and operating expenses. All business operations identified at E.ON are assigned to precisely one of the\n\n- EU taxonomy's economic activities in order to prevent double counting.\n\nE.ON reports the following three indicators for investments, revenues, and operating expenses:\n\n- 1. Taxonomy-eligible activities as a ratio of the total amount shown in the E.ON Group's Consolidated Financial Statements prepared according to IFRS\n- 2. Taxonomy-aligned activities as a ratio of the total amount shown in the E.ON Group's Consolidated Financial Statements prepared according to IFRS\n- 3. Taxonomy-aligned activities as a ratio of taxonomy-eligible activities\n\n## Investments\n\nInvestments were calculated on a gross basis; that is, without taking into account revaluations or depreciation and amortization or impairment charges. They consist of investments in non-current tangible and intangible assets (fixed assets), including assets acquired in asset deals (recorded directly) and share deals (investment amount determined by the purchase-price allocation). More specifically:\n\n- \u00b7 Property, plant, and equipment pursuant to IAS 16.73 (e) (i) and (iii)\n- \u00b7 Intangible assets pursuant to IAS 38.118 (e) (i)\n- \u00b7 Investment property pursuant to IAS 40.76 (a) and (b), IAS 40.79 (d) (i) and (ii)\n- \u00b7 Agriculture pursuant to IAS 41.50 (b) and (e)\n- \u00b7 Leasing pursuant to IFRS 16.53 (h)\n\nGroup investments (denominator) consist of additions to fixed assets plus additions to property, plant, and equipment, and intangible assets from business combinations, which are shown in Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The numerator is equal to, respectively, taxonomy-eligible, or taxonomy-aligned proportion of Group investments.\n\nOf E.ON's taxonomy-eligible investments, property, plant, and equipment accounted for \u20ac5,066 million, intangible assets for \u20ac325 million, and right-of-use assets for \u20ac472 million. \u20ac4,941 million of property, plant, and equipment, \u20ac325 million of intangible assets, and \u20ac468 million of right-of-use assets are taxonomy-aligned. In each case the lion's share went toward our electricity networks (economic activity 4.9).\n\nIn accordance with the taxonomy's specifications, E.ON also includes non-cash-effective investments, but not additions to financial assets. The taxonomy's definition of investments differs from E.ON's internal performance indicator for investments, namely cash-effective investments. E.ON therefore reconciles total investments pursuant to the taxonomy to the investments disclosed in the 'Financial Situation' section of the Business Report:\n\n## Reconciliation to Cash-effective Investments\n\n| \u20ac in millions                          | Q1-Q4 2023   |\n|----------------------------------------|--------------|\n| EU taxonomy: total investments         | 8,049        |\n| ./.

These figures are included in the denominator, whereas the corresponding taxonomy-eligible and/or -aligned revenues are shown in the numerator.\n\n## Operating Expenses\n\nThe denominator for operating expenses is to be specified in accordance with the taxonomy requirements. Ecologically sustainable operating expenses are to include individually attributable, non-capitalized expenses for research and development, building renovations, short-term leasing, maintenance and repairs, other direct expenses in connection with the maintenance of assets, and other expenses necessary for the maintenance of ecologically sustainable economic activities. At E.ON, this mainly includes expenditures for repair and maintenance performed by third parties, which are reported under cost of materials and other operating expenses. The numerator reflects, respectively, the taxonomy-eligible or taxonomy-aligned proportion of operating expenses.\n\nBelow we report on Group-wide EU taxonomy investments, operating expenses, and revenue by segment. Details on the EU taxonomy key figures by economic activity are presented in detail under EU Taxonomy in the Other Information section.\n\n## Investments\n\nIn the 2023 financial year,73 percent of core-business investments were within the scope of the EU taxonomy (taxonomy-eligible). Taxonomy-aligned activities accounted for 98 percent of taxonomy-eligible investments.\n\nThe Energy Networks segment made a significant contribution. About 82 percent of its investments were taxonomy-eligible; nearly all of them were taxonomy-aligned. At roughly \u20ac4.5 billion, the largest contribution came from E.ON's electricity distribution networks, which are part of the European interconnected system. They continually integrate renewable generating facilities, thereby propelling the energy transition in Europe and connecting customers to sustainable energy. E.ON invested significantly more in taxonomy-aligned electricity networks compared with the previous year. This trend is supported by the digitalization of E.ON's networks through the expansion of fiber-optics and broadband technology. E.ON invested \u20ac289 million in this area in the year under review.\n\nIn addition, \u20ac382 million of investments in gas networks were taxonomy-aligned and thus increased significantly relative to the prior year. In Germany in particular, these investments serve to establish and expand hydrogen infrastructure or enable hydrogen to be admixed to E.ON's existing gas networks. \u20ac77 million of the investments in our water networks were taxonomy-aligned.\n\nThe Customer Solutions segment's taxonomy-aligned investments totaled \u20ac0.4 billion. Its businesses that install, maintain, and devices for measuring, regulating, and controlling buildings' overall energy efficiency represented its main contributor to the EU taxonomy. The expansion of its assets for district heating distribution as well as its energy-infrastructure business, which encompasses biofuel-fired electricity and heat cogeneration, as well as investments in plants for heat production with combined feedstocks are likewise covered by the taxonomy. The procurement and sale of power and gas are not covered by the taxonomy. E.ON's distributed solar generating facilities contributed additional amounts. We invested in solar projects in 2023, for example in Germany.\n\n## EU Taxonomy Investments 1,2\n\n| \u20ac in millions             | Taxonomy-eligible investments   | Taxonomy-eligible investments   | Taxonomy-eligible investments   |                          |       | EU taxonomy ratios                 | EU taxonomy ratios                | EU taxonomy ratios                   |\n|---------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|--------------------------|-------|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------------|\n| Q1-Q4 2023                | Taxonomy-  aligned              | Not  taxonomy-  aligned         | Total                           | Not  taxonomy-  eligible | Total | %  Taxonomy-  eligible  (of total) | %  Taxonomy-  aligned  (of total) | %  Taxonomy-  aligned  (of eligible) |\n| Energy Networks           | 5,342                           | 19                              | 5,362                           | 1,168                    | 6,529 | 82                                 | 82                                | 100                                  |\n| Customer Solutions        | 391                             | 110                             | 501                             | 883                      | 1,384 | 36                                 | 28                                | 78                                   |\n| Corporate Functions/Other | -                               | -                               | -                               | 136                      | 136   | -                                  | -                                 | -                                    |\n| E.ON Group                | 5,734                           | 129                             | 5,863                           | 2,187                    | 8,049 | 73                                 | 71                                | 98                                   |\n| 1.-4.

This corresponds to around 97 percent of taxonomy-eligible expenses.\n\nAs with investments, the majority of aligned expenses resulted, as in the prior year, from maintenance activities for E.ON's electricity network (\u20ac754 million). Smaller amounts related to gas distribution networks, particularly to prevent or reduce methane leaks (\u20ac28 million).\n\nThe business with decentralized electricity and/or heat/cooling generation plants accounted for more than \u20ac20 million. \u20ac30 million was related to the installation and maintenance of renewable technologies at the Customer Solutions segment.\n\nThe proportion of the respective taxonomy-aligned as well as taxonomy-eligible operating expenses by economic activity are therefore at the prior-year level.\n\n## EU Taxonomy Operating Expenses 1\n\n| \u20ac in millions             | Taxonomy-eligible operating expenses   | Taxonomy-eligible operating expenses   | Taxonomy-eligible operating expenses   |                          |       | EU taxonomy ratios                 | EU taxonomy ratios                | EU taxonomy ratios                   |\n|---------------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|--------------------------|-------|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------------|\n| Q1-Q4 2023                | Taxonomy-  aligned                     | Not  taxonomy-  aligned                | Total                                  | Not  taxonomy-  eligible | Total | %  Taxonomy-  eligible  (of total) | %  Taxonomy-  aligned  (of total) | %  Taxonomy-  aligned  (of eligible) |\n| Energy Networks           | 797                                    | 1                                      | 798                                    | 217                      | 1,015 | 79                                 | 79                                | 100                                  |\n| Customer Solutions        | 58                                     | 24                                     | 83                                     | 99                       | 182   | 45                                 | 32                                | 70                                   |\n| Corporate Functions/Other | -                                      | -                                      | -                                      | 77                       | 77    | -                                  | -                                 | -                                    |\n| E.ON Group                | 855                                    | 26                                     | 881                                    | 393                      | 1,274 | 69                                 | 67                                | 97                                   |\n| Q1-Q4 2022                |                                        |                                        |                                        |                          |       |                                    |                                   |                                      |\n| Energy Networks           | 831                                    | 6                                      | 837                                    | 185                      | 1,022 | 82                                 | 81                                | 99                                   |\n| Customer Solutions        | 80                                     | 21                                     | 101                                    | 96                       | 197   | 51                                 | 40                                | 79                                   |\n| Corporate Functions/Other | -                                      | -                                      | -                                      | 59                       | 59    | -                                  | -                                 | -                                    |\n| E.ON Group                | 911                                    | 27                                     | 938                                    | 340                      | 1,278 | 73                                 | 71                                | 97                                   |\n\n1 Due to the changes in segment reporting, the previous year's figures have been adjusted accordingly.",

However, revenues from the sale of electricity and gas to end-customers are not covered by the EU taxonomy. As expected, therefore, only 19 percent of external sales were taxonomy-eligible.\n\nNearly all taxonomy-eligible revenues were also taxonomyaligned, of which the vast majority-\u20ac16.2 billion-related to electricity transmission fees in E.ON's distribution networks. E.ON reports \u20ac12.6 billion as external taxonomy-aligned revenues in the Energy Networks segment and \u20ac3.9 billion in the Customer Solutions segment from sales revenues for network charges insofar as these were attributable to E.ON's own distribution network territory.\n\nE.ON generated additional taxonomy-aligned revenues of around \u20ac0.8 billion relating, as in the prior year, to the energy efficiency of buildings and renewable energy technologies, such as the installation, maintenance, and repair of photovoltaic systems, heat pumps, and solar-powered systems for water heating.\n\nOur energy infrastructure business, which generates decentralized electricity and/or heat/cooling from a variety of sources generated around \u20ac0.1 billion in aligned revenues.\n\nThe proportions of the respective taxonomy-aligned as well as taxonomy-eligible revenues by economic activity are therefore at the prior-year level.\n\n## EU Taxonomy Revenues 1\n\n-\n\n-\n\n| \u20ac in millions             | Taxonomy-eligible revenues   | Taxonomy-eligible revenues   | Taxonomy-eligible revenues   |                          |         | EU taxonomy ratios                 | EU taxonomy ratios                | EU taxonomy ratios                   |\n|---------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|--------------------------|---------|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------------|\n| Q1-Q4 2023                | Taxonomy-  aligned           | Not  taxonomy-  aligned      | Total                        | Not  taxonomy-  eligible | Total   | %  Taxonomy-  eligible  (of total) | %  Taxonomy-  aligned  (of total) | %  Taxonomy-  aligned  (of eligible) |\n| Energy Networks           | 12,598                       | 74                           | 12,671                       | 4,945                    | 17,616  | 72                                 | 72                                | 99                                   |\n| Customer Solutions        | 5,058                        | 399                          | 5,457                        | 59,167                   | 64,624  | 8                                  | 8                                 | 93                                   |\n| Corporate Functions/Other | -                            | -                            | -                            | 11,446                   | 11,446  | -                                  | -                                 |                                      |\n| E.ON Group                | 17,655                       | 473                          | 18,128                       | 75,558                   | 93,686  | 19                                 | 19                                | 97                                   |\n| Q1-Q4 2022                |                              |                              |                              |                          |         |                                    |                                   |                                      |\n| Energy Networks           | 10,058                       | 55                           | 10,113                       | 3,914                    | 14,027  | 72                                 | 72                                | 99                                   |\n| Customer Solutions        | 4,737                        | 393                          | 5,130                        | 69,743                   | 74,873  | 7                                  | 6                                 | 92                                   |\n| Corporate Functions/Other | -                            | -                            | -                            | 26,760                   | 26,760  | -                                  | -                                 |                                      |\n| E.ON Group                | 14,795                       | 448                          | 15,243                       | 100,417                  | 115,660 | 13                                 | 13                                | 97                                   |\n\n1 Due to the changes in segment reporting, the previous year's figures have been adjusted accordingly.",

Sustainability aspects play an increasingly important role in many international investors' decision for or against a particular investment. Accordingly, E.ON has also systematically considered sustainability in the structuring of its financing as well, both in debt and credit markets.\n\nIn 2019 E.ON presented its first Green Bond Framework under which it issues green bonds. E.ON issued its first green bonds that same year. In 2021 E.ON then became the first company to fully align its revised Green Bond Framework not only with the ICMA Green Bond Principles-the current market standard for green bonds-but also with the EU Taxonomy. The taxonomy defines which economic activities are classified as environmentally sustainable, thereby setting a Europe-wide standard for sustainable investment. E.ON had \u20ac10.15 billion of green bonds outstanding at year-end 2023, making it Germany's secondlargest issuer of green bonds. The green bonds issued in the year under review accounted for \u20ac2.5 billion of this amount. E.ON secured over \u20ac1.5 billion of green bond financing in January 2024. E.ON intends to cover more than 50 percent of its annual financing requirements with green bonds.\n\nE.ON's Green Bond Framework focuses on sustainable projects in the categories Electricity Networks, Renewable Energy, Energy Efficiency, and Clean Transportation, both in E.ON's electricity network and customer solutions businesses. E.ON's Green Bond Portfolio, a portfolio of qualifying assets in line with the Green Bond Framework, consisted of assets worth \u20ac24.2 billion at yearend 2023. E.ON's electricity networks in Germany and Sweden account for the largest share.\n\nAlongside its focus on green bonds, E.ON's corporate financing includes a sustainability-linked \u20ac3.5 billion syndicated credit facility that was concluded in 2019. After two options to extend the facility were exercised, its term ends in October 2026. The facility's credit margin is linked, among other things, to the development of certain ESG ratings. This gives us additional financial incentives to pursue a sustainable corporate strategy. The ESG ratings are set by three renowned agencies: ISS ESG, MSCI ESG Research, and Sustainalytics. The facility serves as a reliable and sustainable liquidity reserve for the E.ON Group and can be drawn on as needed.\n\n## ESG Ratings of E.ON\n\n\uf09a\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nE.ON has been included in numerous ESG ratings for years. In addition, our regional and national sustainability activities regularly receive awards. In the new compensation system for Management Board members, ESG ratings are a component of the E.ON Sustainability Index and represent a performance criterion that is taken into account in the Management Board's long-term variable compensation. In the ESG ratings that are important to us, E.ON has received predominantly good scores for years. In 2023 E.ON significantly improved its score in two important ESG ratings. The Sustainability Channel at eon.com presents the most relevant and current results. The next section takes a closer look at four ratings that are relevant for E.ON.\n\n## CDP Climate Change\n\nIn 2023 CDP once again placed E.ON on its A List for environmental reporting. E.ON's current rating is in the Leadership Level, placing E.ON among the top 346 companies out of nearly 15,000 assessed to make the A List in 2023.\n\n## ISS ESG\n\nInternational Shareholder Services ('ISS') upgraded E.ON from a C+ rating to B-, giving us Prime status. This means E.ON meets ISS ESG's high standards for sustainability performance in its industry. The letter ratings range from D- to A+. In addition, E.ON's decile\n\nrank is 3. The decile rank indicates in which decile of its industry (tenth of the total number) a company's rating falls. The ranks go from 1 (best: a company's rating is in the top decile of its industry) to 10 (lowest).\n\n## MSCI ESG Research\n\nMSCI is one of the world's best-known index providers. MSCI uses its own ESG ratings to create its sustainability indices. MSCI gave E.ON a rating of AA. Its rating scale extends from CCC to AAA.\n\n## Sustainalytics\n\nSustainalytics is a global leader in providing ESG and corporate governance research and ratings. In 2023 E.ON significantly improved its Sustainalytics ESG Risk Rating. After receiving a score of 23.2 points in the medium risk category in the prior year, E.ON now has 17.6 points and is assessed to be low risk. E.ON is therefore ranked fourth out of the 101 companies rated in its subindustry.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## ESG Asset Management and Pension Assets \uf09a\n\nE.ON links the provision and investment of pension assets to sustainable purposes: by financing a company pension plan and by considering sustainability criteria when making decisions about how the plan's assets are invested. E.ON draws, for example, on the Norwegian State Pension Fund's research and embargo lists in order to avoid questionable investments. We also select asset managers whose investment processes systematically take ESG aspects into account. In addition, E.ON continually develops its own ESG approach to the investment process in order to adapt to the latest developments at the Company and in the market.",

High inflation and interest rate increases by central banks also had a negative impact on the global economy in the year under review. This is reflected in forecasts for gross domestic product ('GDP') growth. The OECD predicts global GDP growth of 2.9 percent in 2023, which is below the 3.3 percent growth recorded in 2022.\n\n## Economic Developments in the EU\n\nEconomic development in the eurozone could not escape the influence of interest rate increases and inflation either, which was reflected in GDP. The OECD predicts eurozone GDP growth of just 0.6 percent in 2023. The European Central Bank ('ECB') responded to persistently high inflation throughout the eurozone in 2022 by reversing its monetary policy in mid-2022 and raising its key interest rate-by 0.5 percentage points-for the first time in 16 years. Additional rate increases followed, bringing the key interest rate to 2.5 percent at the end of December 2022. The ECB continued this interest rate policy in 2023 and raised the key interest rate in several steps (September 2023) to 4.5 percent. The ECB's purpose is to make loans more expensive, dampen demand, and counteract high inflation rates in order to bring inflation back down to a medium-term target of 2 percent. The increase in the key interest rate had the desired effect on inflation. The inflation rate in the eurozone was 5.3 percent in July 2023 but fell to 2.9 percent in December.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Economic Developments in Germany\n\nThe OECD's June 2023 economic forecast for Germany still considered stagnation possible for the reporting year, whereas Germany's GDP shrank by 0.2 percent (according to the OECD) or by 0.3 percent (according to the German Federal Statistical Office). Interest-rate increases constitute a key reason for this development. Their intent was to counteract inflation, but they also dampened economic activity.\n\nInflation, which averaged 6.6 percent in 2023 according to the OECD, affected the economy and households throughout the year.\n\n## Development of Energy Prices\n\nWholesale energy prices declined significantly over the course of 2023 compared with the prior year. The already-achieved and continued expansion of liquefied natural gas ('LNG') import capacity diminished the direct impact of the ongoing war in Ukraine on Europe's supply situation. At the end of last winter's heating period in March 2023, 48 terminals were already in operation in Europe and additional terminals were being planned.\n\nIn addition, generally mild weather conditions last winter made it possible to conserve gas reserves in underground storage facilities compared with prior years. The EU-wide inventory level on April 1, 2023, was still around 56 percent (prior year: only around 27 percent). This helped enable facility operators to fill their storage facilities by the start of the six-month winter season on October 1, 2023, because demand and thus pressure on wholesale prices were correspondingly lower. Gas storage facilities were already around 96 percent full at this date and were still around 86 percent full at year-end.\n\nAt the time of this report's publication, reliable statements about reductions in customers' consumption for the winter as a whole were not yet possible due to weather factors. In the winter of 2022/23, households in Germany, for example, reduced their consumption by about 10 percent (which is equal to the estimated temperature-independent reduction) and in the United Kingdom by around 15 percent. On balance, conservation helped lower demand on wholesale markets and also had a price-dampening effect.\n\nAt the beginning of 2023, the month-ahead contract for one MWh of gas at TTF, a virtual trading point in the Netherlands, cost \u20ac77. Prices stabilized at around \u20ac35 by year-end. The trend for power was similar. The year-ahead contract for one MWh of baseload power cost \u20ac214 at the start of the year compared with around \u20ac100 at year-end. This means that the overall price level is currently below the level before the start of the war in Ukraine but remains almost twice as high as the long-term average before the start of the energy crisis.\n\nThe main factors behind the currently still elevated price levels are the aforementioned uncertainty regarding weather for the winter as a whole, residual geopolitical risks, and competition for LNG on the global market. By contrast, the anticipated expansion of major producers' gas liquefaction capacity in the years ahead could lead to declining LNG prices in the medium term.",

The document contains key statements on energy. Like the EU and the German delegates at COP28, E.ON believes that a clear plan for phasing out fossil fuels is lacking at the global level. The decarbonization of the energy system will thus remain a critical challenge to achieve the 1.5\u00b0C target.\n\n## Europe\n\nIn view of the energy crisis last year triggered by the war in Ukraine and the increasingly tangible consequences of climate change, EU institutions initiated or enhanced crisis-management measures.\n\nIn March 2022 the European Commission therefore adopted a new Temporary Crisis and Transition Framework for state aid to further support investments in key sectors for the transition to a climate-neutral economy and to tackle the energy crisis. The framework allows member states, for example, to introduce additional measures that apply until the end of 2025 and to support the deployment of renewable energy, storage facilities, and systems to decarbonize industrial processes, including hydrogen. Under certain conditions, member states can align aid granted to beneficiaries in other countries outside the EU. In addition, the framework allows member states to support companies amid the energy crisis through various measures that were valid until December 31, 2023. In addition, the Commission extended until June 2024 some of the measures to grant small subsidies and to offset exceptionally high energy prices for companies most affected by the crisis.\n\nThe European Commission also proposed to extend two other emergency regulations. The first concerns Regulation (EU) 2022/2578 on the market-correction mechanism for gas. The regulation introduces a sort of pressure relief valve to protect the economy from excessively high prices. The second concerns the emergency regulation on permit-granting procedures (EU) 2022/2577, which introduces simplified rules for the granting of permits in order to accelerate the expansion of renewables and associated network infrastructure. The measures it contains are also contained in the amended Renewable Energy Directive ('RED') and, after the emergency regulation's expiration, will therefore become permanent. The European Council approved the European Commission's proposals on extending the emergency regulations.\n\nThe European Commission published a proposal on March 16, 2023, to amend the directive and regulation on the European internal power market. The changes to the power market design aim to (i) introduce long-term stimulus for new investments (such as through bilateral agreements for differences and power price agreements), (ii) protect consumers (such as by means of certain price regulation requirements in times of crisis), and (iii) introduce new regulatory requirements to further promote flexibility. The European Council and the European Parliament adopted their respective negotiating positions during the year and reached an agreement on December 14. The new power market design is supposed to take effect and be further implemented in 2024.\n\nIn addition, numerous measures to accelerate renewables expansion and the decarbonization of industry in the EU were initiated or continued.\n\nThe Net Zero Industry Act ('NZIA') aims, for example, to support the production of technologies that are decisive for the achievement of climate neutrality. The NZIA is intended to simplify the legal framework for the manufacture of these technologies and thus to enhance the competitiveness of Europe's net-zero technology industry.\n\nIn addition, the delegated regulations on green hydrogen-(EU) 2023/1184 and (EU) 2023/1185-were published in the Official Journal of the European Union on June 20, 2023. The first regulation establishes three conditions (additionality, temporal correlation, and geographical correlation between an electrolyser and the installation generating renewable energy for it) and exceptions, under which hydrogen-based fuels can be classified as renewable fuels of nonbiological origin ('RFNBO'). The second regulation contains a method for calculating RFNBO's life cycle greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nDirective (EU) 2023/2413 on support for energy from renewable sources was published on October 18, 2023. It introduces a new minimum of 42.5 percent for energy renewables' share of the EU's gross energy consumption as well as sector targets. Furthermore, member states must establish requirements for accelerating approvals processes for renewables facilities and for network expansion.\n\nIn addition, the European Council and the European Parliament agreed on a gas package. In particular, the new EU gas directive updates consumer-protection mechanisms for gas customers and adjusts the modalities of network access and network planning to reflect the current context, which is characterized by increased use of low-carbon gases. In the future, a distinction is to be made between, and different rules established for, hydrogen distribution system operators ('DSOs') and hydrogen transmission system operators ('TSOs'). The (vertical) unbundling rules require infrastructure to be separated from competitive activities in a way that is similar to existing unbundling rules for gas. Consequently, less strict rules will apply to DSOs for hydrogen as well. In addition, only gas and hydrogen TSOs will have to operate as legally separate network companies. Exceptions are possible at the national level, however, for TSOs that submit a cost-benefit analysis that is confirmed by their national regulatory agency. DSOs will be exempted from horizontal unbundling.",

In particular, the regulation introduces new obligations for gas infrastructure operators to conduct periodic checks to detect and eliminate leaks, to identify the sources of methane emissions, and to repair or replace the components in question. The Commission must, within 12 months, issue an implementing act that specifies minimum detection limits.\n\nIn addition, the new EU Directive 2023/1791 on energy efficiency was published on September 13, 2023. It contains ambitious targets for reducing the EU's energy consumption by at least 11.7 percent by 2030 relative to the EU reference scenario. Member states must stipulate their respective contribution and achieve new annual energy savings that gradually increase to 1.9 percent by 2030. On December 7, 2023, the European Council and European Parliament reached an agreement on revising the energy performance of buildings directive, which introduces new requirements for decarbonizing buildings, including ambitious targets for the availability of charging infrastructure for electric vehicles and for readiness for zero-emissions buildings.\n\nThe European Commission published an EU Grid Action Plan on November 29, 2023. The plan is a non-legislative announcement that outlines additional strategic initiatives to foster the modernization of power networks and thus to support Europe's climate-protection and renewables targets. The initiative's principle aim is to simplify the funding and approval of network modernization.\n\n## Germany\n\nIn mid-2022 the Bundestag passed the Easter package to accelerate renewables expansion. It amended a variety of legislation, such as the Renewable Energy Sources Act (German abbreviation: EEG), to increase the target for the proportion of renewable energy in gross power consumption from 50 percent to 80 percent by 2030. The focus is on expanding solar energy. Compared with the previous target of 100 GW for 2030, installed\n\nphotovoltaic capacity is to be more than doubled to over 215 GW, and onshore wind capacity is to be increased from 71 GW to 115 GW. In 2023 the annual target of 9 GW net additions to photovoltaic capacity was already met in September. At the end of the third quarter of 2023, additions to onshore wind capacity amounted to around 50 percent of the annual target of 3.9 GW.\n\nThe number of requests for new network connections for feed-in systems has increased considerably in recent years. In view of the above-described accelerated implementation of climate-protection efforts, this figure is likely to continue to rise sharply. For example, the number of PV requests received by E.ON power distribution system operators doubled from around 120,000 in 2021 to about 240,000 in 2022. Requests increased a further 70 percent to about 400,000 in 2023. Additional measures for standardization, digitalization, and automation of network connection processes are necessary to enable network connection requests to be processed in a timely manner.\n\nIn line with its corporate strategy, E.ON endorses the German federal government's initiatives to accelerate renewables expansion. We also support accelerated renewables growth by the necessary expansion of our smart distribution networks. The significant increase in momentum and the resulting need for additional investments reinforce E.ON's growth strategy. The Forecast Report describes our investment plans in particular for 2024.\n\nTo achieve policymakers' expansion targets, the mechanisms for accelerating planning and approval procedures in particular must also have an impact, and the additional measures from the Pact for Accelerating Planning, Approval, and Implementation between the federal and state governments from early November 2023 must be implemented promptly.\n\nThe German federal government took steps to accelerate the rollout of smart energy meters by adopting the Metering Point Operation Act (German abbreviation: MsbG). The MsbG, which\n\nwas amended by the Act on the Restart of the Digitalization of the Energy Transition, establishes a timetable with binding targets through 2030. Metering point operators are obliged to successively equip connected consumption points with smart metering systems. The law took effect in May 2023.\n\nThe amended Section 14a of the Energy Industry Act (German abbreviation: EnWG) stipulates that, in the future, controllable consumption devices like electric heat pumps and wallboxes for electric cars are be controlled on a network-oriented basis and, in return, are to receive network fee reductions. This mechanism does not replace the upgrading of distribution networks, but supplements it temporarily. In late November 2023 the Federal Network Agency (German abbreviation: BNetzA) adopted a corresponding regulation.\n\nIn June 2023 the German federal government also initiated the amendment of the Climate Protection Act. Originally, the Climate Protection Act provided for annual emissions reduction targets for the energy, industry, transport, buildings, agriculture, and wastemanagement sectors. The current amendment stipulates, among other things, that climate targets are to be met on a forwardlooking, multiyear, and cross-sector basis rather than retroactively by sector. Emissions reduction targets for individual sectors are therefore to be eliminated.\n\nThe need to completely convert the power sector to renewables in a short space of time and to make this conversion efficient, secure, and fast requires the modification of Germany's power market design. For this reason, in 2023 the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Protection launched the Platform for a Climate-Neutral Power System to serve as a discussion forum on the future design of the power market. Stakeholders from parliament, the European Commission, science, business, and civil society are involved.\n\nIn order to achieve the goal of fully decarbonizing the heat supply by 2045, the Building Energy Act, which aims to convert heating",

The Building Energy Act stipulates that, in the future, new heating systems may only be installed if at least 65 percent of the heat they generate comes from renewable sources. This applies to new buildings from January 2024 onward, with transitional periods through 2028 for existing buildings. The regulations are accompanied by, among other things, incomedependent subsidies. The Heating Planning Act initially foresees that 30 percent of the heat in existing heating networks is to be renewable. At the same time, the federal states are obliged to work toward ensuring that local authorities draw up heating plans by 2028 at the latest. The plans specify which areas are to be supplied with distributed or district heating and how renewable energy and waste heat can be used. How the methane emissions regulation adopted by the EU will affect gas networks cannot yet be fully assessed, because the specific requirements for gas network operators have not yet been conclusively defined.\n\nThe Energy Industry Act (German abbreviation: EnWG) was amended several times in 2023. Various topics were addressed, in particular the implementation of the ECJ's ruling on the independence of the Federal Network Agency (German abbreviation: BNetzA) and the development of a hydrogen core grid, including its financing. Central to the implementation of the ECJ ruling is the formal upgrading of the BNetzA, which is now solely responsible for setting the conditions for network access and network fees (power, gas, hydrogen). In a motion for a resolution passed parallel to the main EnWG amendment, it was announced that additional regulations for networks connection are anticipated.\n\nFollowing the latest cost review, the BNetzA confirmed the cost basis of E.ON's distribution network operating companies for the fourth regulatory period for power, although the final determinations are still pending and are expected in the first quarter of 2024. In 2023 the BNetzA also set some of the important regulatory parameters for the fourth regulatory period\n\n(2023 to 2027 for gas, 2024 to 2028 for power). During the year the BNetzA, among other things, announced an increase in the interest rates for the cost of debt and cost of equity component of the capital cost surcharge for new investments in power and gas networks from 2024 onward. This is intended to take account of current interest-rate developments and also to provide incentives for new investments in network expansion to propel the energy transition. However, these determinations only represent temporary regulations that are limited to the duration of the fourth regulatory period. E.ON's distribution network operating companies filed an appeal to the capital cost of debt part within the capital cost surcharge for new investments in power and gas networks from 2024 onward with the aim of extending the regulation to 2023, in particular in order to take sufficient account of the development of interest rates for cost of debt in 2023. In addition, E.ON's network operators are considering whether to file a similar objection to the equity portion.\n\nHowever, some important regulatory parameters for the fourth regulatory period-for example, the general and individual productivity factors for gas and power-have not yet been finalized or are still under discussion or consultation with the BNetzA. The determination of the regulatory return on equity (known as the cost of equity I interest rate) for the fourth regulatory period is also not yet legally binding, because the BNetzA has filed an appeal with the Federal Court of Justice (German abbreviation: BGH) against a ruling issued in August 2023 by the D\u00fcsseldorf Higher Regional Court, which had ruled in favor of network operators in their first appeal in their original lawsuit. A ruling by the BGH is expected some time in 2024.\n\nAs announced, the BNetzA is planning a review of the current regulatory framework with regard to the rapidly increasing demands placed on network operators by the energy and climate transition. In early 2024 the BNetzA published a white paper containing initial proposals and presented it to energy-industry representatives and other stakeholders. The white paper focuses on refinements to the regulatory framework for the fifth\n\nregulatory period (for gas from 2028 onward, for power from 2029 onward) for DSOs and gas TSOs, as well as the need for short-term adjustments to gas networks' useful operating lifetimes. The BNetzA has planned a discussion process that will last until the end of 2025. Existing laws will continue to apply until further notice. Actual changes for network operators will only arise when the results are codified into a formally binding legal framework. With regard to the white paper for the fifth regulatory period, this is expected to take place in 2026.\n\nRegulations were established for a core network for hydrogen. It is to be about 10,000 kilometers long and initially serve for transport and supply to large customers. The core network was planned alongside the legislative process and is expected to be approved by the Federal Network Agency in the first quarter of 2024 so that pipelines can be built in a timely manner. State protection (using the amortization approach) is planned for the investments of network operators in the core network.\n\nConsiderable efforts in all legal and economic areas remain necessary for Germany to achieve its expansion targets for photovoltaics. Amendments to the Renewable Energy Sources Act (German abbreviation: EEG) in particular are intended to pave the way for achieving the expansion targets defined in EEG 2023 in a way that is compatible with the energy system as a whole. The German federal government intends for the draft legislation to reconfigure the subsizes for special solar systems (agri PV, floating PV, moor PV, and parking PV), facilitate the expansion of rooftop photovoltaic systems, simplify tenant-produced power, and enable the communal supply of buildings. It also aims to facilitate plug-in solar systems and accelerate grid connection.\n\nAs relief for gas and heat customers, a reduced VAT on gas and heat deliveries applied in 2023. It expires on March 31, 2024.\n\nOn November 15, 2023, the Federal Constitutional Court ruled that the law on the second supplementary budget for 2021 is unconstitutional. The ruling directly affects the Climate and",

If the ruling's principles are applied to the other special funds, the Economic Stabilization Fund (German abbreviation: WSF) is also indirectly affected. As a result, the German government did not, as planned, extend state funding by means of power and gas price caps until the end of March 2024; instead, they expired at the end of 2023.\n\nIn terms of (cyber) security, Germany's implementation of the resilience of critical entities directive ('CER Directive'), the measures for high common level of cyber security ('NIS2 Directive'), the European Commission's network code on cybersecurity focused on avoiding unnecessary bureaucracy and double regulation. E.ON has largely implemented the planned security measures.\n\n## United Kingdom\n\nThe U.K. government provided billions of pounds of financial support to help households and businesses cope with the worst effects of high wholesale prices in the first quarter of 2023. Wholesale energy prices have since fallen from their peak, but bills are still almost double what they were before the energy crisis. Energy affordability remains a key policy concern, as some customers are finding it increasingly difficult to bear the costs. In response, a winter subsidy was introduced. Despite the challenges of energy affordability, the U.K. government remains committed to its net-zero emissions target and increased subsidies in some areas, such as heat pumps, by 50 percent to accelerate adoption. In other areas, however, the pace of change slowed slightly, as evidenced by the recent decision to postpone the ban on the sale of new gasoline and diesel cars by five years to 2035, although the target that 80 percent of all new cars will be electric by 2030 remains in place.\n\n## Netherlands\n\nIn 2023 the Dutch government adopted a \u20ac11.2 billion support package for energy costs. Together with energy suppliers, it introduced a price cap against rising energy prices. The energy sector established a \u20ac50 million emergency fund for the most\n\nvulnerable households. The aim is to enable 165,000 such households to pay their energy bills. It was announced that the 2024 budget foresees no general price increases for 2024. After the cabinet's resignation in the summer and the elections held in late November 2023, the focus is on forming a new government.\n\n## Italy\n\nItaly's government extended existing support measures for endcustomers through the end of 2023 (a reduction in general network charges, social grants for vulnerable customers, and a VAT reduction for natural gas only). However, the government already expressed its willingness to limit the support measures for vulnerable customers in 2024 in order to reduce costs for public budgets.\n\nAlongside these measures, the liberalization process continued in order to abolish the protective conditions for Italy's 9 million nonvulnerable customers. In the power sector, auctions are being held for nonvulnerable household end-customers who are to be transferred to the free market. In the gas sector, regulated prices for nonvulnerable customers were abolished from the start of 2024.\n\nThe government also presented a first updated version of its National Energy and Climate Plan, which is to be based on a realistic and technology-neutral approach. In addition, additional decarbonization measures are being discussed or are in the approval phase. The aim is to support the development of renewable energy facilities and projects and thus to help Italy achieve its climate targets for 2030.\n\n## Sweden\n\nAt the beginning of 2023, Sweden's government provided financial support for households and companies that had been most affected by high power prices in the fourth quarter of 2022 and the first quarter of 2023. Prices have since stabilized, and the government announced no plans for financial support for the winter of 2023/2024. While power prices have stabilized, district\n\nheating prices rose sharply, mainly because of greater demand for Nordic biomass due to lower imports from Russia. The rise in district heating prices attracted a lot of media attention and led to a policy debate on stricter price regulation. The government continued to focus on ensuring a robust electricity system with nuclear energy as the basis for the power supply. It took numerous initiatives during the year to develop nuclear energy with the clear aim of building new reactors.\n\n## East-Central Europe\n\nAlthough the European Commission recommended that Romania abolish the mechanism for capping energy prices by the end of 2023, current law calls for power and gas prices to remain capped for both households and nonhouseholds until the end of March 2025. Consumers are increasingly submitting requests to become prosumers, a trend supported by high Romanian government and EU funding. In addition, new renewables projects are being developed. In view of these factors, government authorities recognize the need to reshape the role of utilities and limit the capacity of new renewables projects that will be connected to power networks.\n\nSlovakia adopted a number of measures in 2023 to reduce the impact of high energy prices on households and businesses. These included in particular i) reimbursing additional costs to cover network losses for households and other power end-consumers at the level of 2022, ii) granting a subsidy to companies and administrative entities to cover additional costs resulting from energy price increases, and iii) establishing a guaranteed price for the power component for households in 2023 and 2024.\n\nThe Czech Republic introduced a package of temporary crisis measures in 2023 to shield end-consumers-including households, businesses, and large industrial customers-from high energy prices. In addition, the government is revising social subsidy programs in order to combat energy poverty. Customers responded to recent market volatility and available government financial aid by embracing self-generation, resulting in a",

This put significant pressure on the availability of network connection capacity. At the same time, the government continued to revise the market design and define measures to support the Czech Republic on its path to carbon neutrality.\n\nThe Hungarian government's energy policy for 2023 focused on keeping prices low for households and strengthening power networks in order to integrate more renewable energy. A Ministry of Energy and a Ministry for EU Affairs were also established in 2023. The latter is coordinating and planning Hungary's EU Council presidency in the second half of 2024.\n\n## Special Events in the Reporting Period\n\n## War in Ukraine Continues to Create Significant Macroeconomic Uncertainty and Impacts the Energy Sector\n\nE.ON's priority since the beginning of the war in Ukraine in early 2022 has been to secure the energy supply in these anxious times. E.ON's power, gas, and heat networks in various regions of Europe are running stably, even in the current situation.\n\nThe war's repercussions also have implications for E.ON's business. In particular, volatile commodity prices and energy demand behavior impact our operations and are described in greater detail below in the sections entitled 'Earnings Situation' and 'Financial Situation.'\n\n## E.ON Successfully Issues Bonds in 2023\n\nIn 2023 E.ON successfully issued four bonds totaling \u20ac3.3 billion:\n\n- \u00b7 \u20ac800 million bond that matures in January 2028 and has a coupon of 3.5 percent (January 2023)\n- \u00b7 \u20ac1 billion green bond that matures in January 2035 and has a coupon of 3.875 percent (January 2023)\n- \u00b7 \u20ac750 million green bond that matures in March 2029 and has a coupon of 3.75 percent (August 2023)\n- \u00b7 \u20ac750 million green bond that matures in August 2033 and has a coupon of 4 percent (August 2023).\n\n## Changes in Segment Reporting\n\nE.ON's segment reporting was adjusted effective January 1, 2023. PreussenElektra's generation activities were originally planned to end on December 31, 2022. Consequently, Non-Core Business has been reported under Corporate Functions/Other from the beginning of 2023. In addition, owing to the discontinuation of operations and the dismantling of all nuclear power plants, the associated expenses and income are reported under non-operating expense/income.\n\n## Earthquakes in Southeastern Turkey and Northern Syria\n\nSoutheastern Turkey and northern Syria experienced several major earthquakes on February 6, 2023, and in the days afterward. They resulted in electricity and gas service outages. At E.ON, Enerjisa Enerji's supply territory was affected. Network repair activities are still ongoing, and the power supply has largely been restored. All of Enerjisa \u00dcretim's power plants are fully operational. From today's perspective, there have been no material implications for E.ON's asset, financial, and earnings situation.\n\n## Consortium Agreement with RheinEnergie\n\nThe consortium agreement concluded on June 29, 2021, between Westenergie AG, a fully consolidated subsidiary of the E.ON Group, and RheinEnergie AG was finalized effective March 31, 2023, after the conditions imposed by the Bundeskartellamt (German Federal Cartel Office) were met. The closing of the transaction enabled Westenergie and RheinEnergie to merge shareholdings in individual municipal utilities into rhenag. It also resulted in the initial consolidation of AggerEnergie GmbH in the E.ON Group. In addition, Westenergie transferred 20 percent of the shares of Stadtwerke Duisburg, which, pursuant to IFRS 5, was previously included in E.ON's Consolidated Financial\n\nStatements as an associated company, to RheinEnergie, which increased its share in RheinEnergie from 20 to 24.2 percent.\n\n## Conclusion of a Future Consolidation Agreement with ZSE Shareholders\n\nOn April 8, 2022, the shareholders of Z\u00e1padoslovensk\u00e1 energetika a.s. ('ZSE') and of V\u00fdchodoslovensk\u00e1 energetika Holding a.s. ('VSEH'), E.ON SE, and the Slovak Republic, concluded a Future Consolidation Agreement to combine ZSE and the VSEH Group. The agreement provides, among other things, for 100 percent of VSEH shares to be transferred to ZSE, the sale of all VSEH subsidiaries to ZSE, and the implementation of corporate law changes at VSEH.\n\nThe transfer of VSEH shares to ZSE results in ZSE being VSEH's sole shareholder (and thus also shareholder of the VSEH subsidiaries). The ownership interests in ZSE remains unchanged; that is, E.ON has a 49 percent stake in ZSE and the Slovakian state a 51 percent stake. The new ZSE shareholder agreement essentially corresponds to the shareholder agreement that has been in force before. After closing of the agreement, ZSE continues to be accounted for using the equity method in E.ON's Consolidated Financial Statements, while the business activities of VSEH, which was previously fully consolidated, are now integrated in this joint venture.\n\nThe transaction was originally expected to be closed by the end of 2022. Accordingly, the VSEH Group has been presented as a disposal group in accordance with IFRS 5 since December 31, 2021. The last condition precedent was fulfilled on June 12, 2023. On November 23, 2023, all closing conditions were formally met-in particular, the signing of the relevant documents such as the agreement on the transfer and contribution of the shares and the amended and restated shareholders' agreement as well as registration by the Slovak Central Depositary of Securities of the transfer of all of the VSEH's shares to ZSE and publication of all relevant documents with the Central Register of Contracts. As of this date, the VSEH Group was deconsolidated and the value of the",

By continuing to operate in the winter of 2022-2023, Germany's NPPs made a valuable contribution toward securing the energy supply amid the crisis. Isar 2 NPP was taken offline at the close of April 15, 2023, and its reactor was shut down. The dismantling of the entire facility has begun.\n\nPreussenElektra earned power-market proceeds for about 2 TWh since January 1, 2023. These proceeds must be set against the additional costs arising from the extension and the provisions of the Act on the Introduction of an Electricity Price Cap and on the Amendment of Other Provisions of Energy Law (German abbreviation: 'StromPBG') on the Taxation of Electricity Market Revenues, which took effect on December 24, 2022. E.ON plans to take the proceeds from continued operation and use them for investments in the implementation of energy transition.\n\n## Erich Clementi is the New Chairman of the E.ON SE Supervisory Board\n\nAt a constitutive meeting of the Supervisory Board following the Annual Shareholders Meeting on May 17, 2023, Erich Clementi was elected to succeed Karl-Ludwig Kley. Erich Clementi has been Deputy Chairman of the E.ON SE Supervisory Board since 2016. Karl-Ludwig Kley decided not to stand for reelection to the Supervisory Board. In addition, the E.ON SE Supervisory Board now consists of 16 members. The previous size of 20 members had applied temporarily and for a limited period following the innogy takeover.\n\n## Middle East Conflict: Hamas Attack on Israel\n\nFollowing Hamas's attack on Israel on October 7, 2023, and the subsequent counterattacks, the conflict has not caused a major regional war, and its impact on energy markets is currently minimal. A team from E.ON's Innovation Hub is based in Israel. We will continue to support it through our collaboration and investments. The escalation of the Middle East conflict has so far not had any noteworthy impact on E.ON's business activities.\n\n## Supervisory Board to Decide on Patrick Lammers's Successor\n\nPrior to the Supervisory Board meeting in mid-December 2023, the E.ON SE Supervisory Board and Patrik Lammers jointly agreed not to extend his contract, which runs until July 31, 2024. Patrick Lammers will continue to perform his role as Chief Operating Officer-Commercial until the end of his contract term. The Supervisory Board will decide on his successor in the course of 2024.\n\n## Subsequent Events\n\n## Changes to Business Model\n\nOn September 11, 2023, the Management Board approved a new management concept for the E.ON Group. Effective from January 1, 2024, this entails a change in the definition of certain operating segments in accordance with IFRS 8 and the reallocation of the current goodwill amounts for all operating segments affected by the changes and reporting goodwill as of January 1, 2024. The Management Board's decision was regarded as an opportunity to test the goodwill of the existing operating segments for impairment. The impairment tests carried out as of September 2023 found no indication of impairment. Following the entry into force of the new management concept, the goodwill amounts reallocated as of January 1, 2024, are subject to the provisions of IAS 36 on impairment testing. In the new Energy Infrastructure Solutions segment, there may be an impairment risk of up to a mid-triple-digit million euro amount. The Business Model chapter contains more information.\n\n## E.ON Successfully Issues \u20ac1.5 Billion in Green Bonds at the Start of the Year\n\nIn early January E.ON successfully issued two bonds totaling \u20ac1.5 billion:\n\n- \u00b7 \u20ac750 million green bond that matures in January 2031 and has a coupon of 3.375 percent\n- \u00b7 \u20ac750 million green bond that matures in January 2036 and has a coupon of 3.75 percent.\n\nThese bond transactions have enabled E.ON to lay the foundation for covering its funding requirements for 2024.\n\n## Arbitration Proceedings in Spain\n\nE.ON SE, E.ON Finanzanlagen GmbH, and E.ON Iberia Holding GmbH are plaintiffs in arbitration proceedings against the Kingdom of Spain. In the arbitration proceedings, the three companies are asserting claims for damages for changes to Span's remuneration scheme for renewable energy. The arbitration proceedings have been pending at the International Center for Settlement of Investment Disputes ('ICSID') since they were registered on August 10, 2015. On January 18, 2024, an arbitration tribunal awarded the companies damages totaling approximately \u20ac0.3 billion. As the legal process has not yet been exhausted and there are therefore still uncertainties regarding the proceedings' final outcome, E.ON is not reporting a receivable or any associated income in its 2023 financial statements. Instead, it discloses a contingent receivable.\n\n## Termination of the Operating Concession for a Wastewater Treatment Plant in Croatia\n\nA concession agreement for the operation of a wastewater treatment plant exists between Zagrebacke otpadne vode d.o.o, a company consolidated in the E.ON Group using the equity method, and the City of Zagreb. By majority resolution of the city assembly on January 25, 2024, the City of Zagreb exercised its contractually agreed-on right to unilaterally terminate this concession. This",

The manner in which the sale will take place had yet to be determined by the City of Zagreb at the time of the Consolidated Financial Statements' preparation. The transactions' financial effects cannot yet be reliably estimated at the time of preparation either.\n\n## Business Performance\n\nE.ON's operating business delivered a positive performance in the 2023 financial year, and E.ON surpassed its forecast for key performance indicators.\n\nExternal sales in the 2023 financial year decreased by 19 percent to \u20ac93.7 billion. This performance is mainly attributable to lower sales volume due to customers' energy conservation and portfolio streamlining. Lower price levels on wholesale markets also had an adverse impact on sales.\n\nThe E.ON Group's adjusted EBITDA of \u20ac9.4 billion was \u20ac1.3 billion above the prior-year figure of \u20ac8.1 billion and above the forecast range of \u20ac8.6 to \u20ac8.8 billion, which had been adjusted in August 2023 (previously: \u20ac7.8 to \u20ac8 billion). Energy Networks recorded adjusted EBITDA of \u20ac6.6 billion, which was likewise above the adjusted forecast range of \u20ac6.3 to \u20ac6.5 billion (previously: \u20ac6 to \u20ac6.2 billion). Customer Solutions' adjusted EBITDA of \u20ac2.8 billion was also above the adjusted forecast range of \u20ac2.3 to \u20ac2.5 billion (previously: \u20ac1.8 to \u20ac2 billion). Adjusted EBITDA at Corporate Functions/Other of -\u20ac0.1 billion was in line with expectations.\n\nAdjusted net income of \u20ac3.1 billion was likewise above the prioryear figure of \u20ac2.7 billion and the forecast range of \u20ac2.7 billion to \u20ac2.9 billion, which had been adjusted in August 2023 (previously: \u20ac2.3 to \u20ac2.5 billion). Earnings per share, which are based on adjusted net income, amounted to \u20ac1.18 in the year under review\n\n(prior year: \u20ac1.05) and thus surpassed the forecast range of \u20ac1.03 to \u20ac1.11 (previously: \u20ac0.88 to \u20ac0.96).\n\nFurther growth in the regulated asset base due to additional investments was Energy Networks' main contribution to this positive earnings performance. In addition, the recovery of the energy market environment in 2023 led to significant reductions in redispatch expenditures in Germany. The calming of the market environment and the stabilization of price levels on procurement markets in nearly all E.ON regions contributed to a relative earnings improvement at Customer Solutions. The adjustment of energy procurement to current market conditions in the United Kingdom, Germany, and the Netherlands was another positive earnings factor. Higher risk provisions for bad debt losses was a countervailing factor.\n\nCash-effective investments of \u20ac6.4 billion were significantly above the prior-year figure of \u20ac4.8 billion and also above the target figure of roughly \u20ac6.1 billion, which had been adjusted in November (previously: roughly \u20ac5.9 billion). Energy Networks' investments of \u20ac5.2 billion surpassed the forecast figure of \u20ac4.6 billion. They were accelerated in particular in the fourth quarter owing to capacity increases and went mainly toward network infrastructure projects. Customer Solutions' investments of \u20ac1.1 billion were as forecast. Corporate Functions/Other's investments were in line with the forecast figure of \u20ac0.1 billion.",

The main reason for the declining energy wheeling volume was the war in Ukraine and associated energy-conservation measures.\n\nBy contrast, fourth-quarter wheeling volume was slightly above that of the prior-year quarter. This is attributable to lower price levels on commodity markets.\n\n## System Length and Network Customers\n\nE.ON's power system in Germany was about 694,000 kilometers long, slightly above the prior-year figure (about 691,000 kilometers). At year-end it had about 14.9 million network customers for power in its service territory (prior year: 14.8 million). E.ON's gas system was almost unchanged at about 99,000 kilometers (prior year: about 98,000 kilometers), as was the number of network customers, 1.9 million.\n\nThe length of E.ON's power system in Sweden was 142,000 kilometers (prior year: about 141,000 kilometers). The number of customers in the power distribution system was about 1.1 million, unchanged from the prior year.\n\nE.ON operates electricity networks in East-Central Europe/Turkey with a total system length of roughly 274,000 kilometers (prior year: about 275,000 kilometers) and supplies, as in the prior year, about 8.4 million network customers. Gas networks operated by E.ON were roughly 50,000 kilometers long (prior year: 49,000 kilometers). The number of gas network customers is about 2.8 million (prior year: about 2.7 million).\n\n## Wheeling Volume\n\n|                                  | Germany   | Germany   | Sweden   | Sweden   | East-Central Europe/Turkey   | East-Central Europe/Turkey   | Total   | Total   |\n|----------------------------------|-----------|-----------|----------|----------|------------------------------|------------------------------|---------|---------|\n| Billion kWh                      | 2023      | 2022      | 2023     | 2022     | 2023  \u00b9                      | 2022                         | 2023    | 2022    |\n| Fourth quarter                   |           |           |          |          |                              |                              |         |         |\n| Power                            | 61.1      | 58.3      | 9.9      | 8.9      | 14.0                         | 14.4                         | 85.0    | 81.6    |\n| Network loss, station use,  etc. | 2.0       | 2.0       | 0.3      | 0.2      | 0.7                          | 0.8                          | 3.0     | 3.0     |\n| Gas                              | 44.1      | 43.8      | 0.0      | 0.0      | 13.1                         | 12.8                         | 57.2    | 56.6    |\n| Full year                        |           |           |          |          |                              |                              |         |         |\n| Power                            | 220.5     | 229.6     | 33.3     | 33.7     | 53.9                         | 57.0                         | 307.7   | 320.3   |\n| Network loss, station use,  etc. | 6.9       | 7.0       | 1.0      | 1.0      | 2.8                          | 3.2                          | 10.7    | 11.2    |\n| Gas                              | 149.8     | 159.8     | 0.0      | 0.0      | 40.0                         | 43.0                         | 189.8   | 202.8   |\n\n1 VSEH of Slovakia is only included until its transfer to ZSE (end of November).",

The primary reasons for the decline in power and gas sales in almost all of E.ON's regional markets were portfolio streamlining in line with our B2B strategy, mild weather, as well as crisis-related energy conservation and the associated decline in consumption.\n\n## Customer Numbers\n\nCustomer Solutions' fully consolidated companies had a total of about 34.7 million customers at year-end 2023, less than the prior-year figure of 35.9 million. The number of customers in Germany declined slightly to 14.2 million (prior year: 14.4 million) because competition became keen again. In the United Kingdom the number of customers declined slightly to 8.9 million owing to our strategic focus on customers that deliver strong sales and portfolio streamlining as part of our B2B strategy (prior year: 9.1 million). At 3.9 million, the number of customers in the Netherlands was almost at the prior-year level (4 million).

For the sake of clarity and in order to provide more useful commentary, the Combined Group Management Report only discloses external sales and only comments on the change in external sales with regard to the segments' performance.\n\nThe E.ON Group's external sales in 2023 declined by \u20ac22 billion to \u20ac93.7 billion (prior year: \u20ac115.7 billion).\n\nEnergy Networks' sales of \u20ac17.6 billion were \u20ac3.6 billion above the prior-year figure. This development is attributable in particular to the significant increase in power price levels in 2022. The growth in the regulated asset base continued to have a positive impact on sales.  The increase also resulted from higher tariffs charged by transmission system operators.\n\nCustomer Solutions' sales declined by \u20ac10.3 billion to \u20ac64.6 billion. The decrease is mainly attributable to a decline in sales volume in nearly all E.ON regions due to customers' energy conservation as well as portfolio streamlining. The successive passthrough to end-customers of crisis-driven high procurement costs had a countervailing effect. It had the largest impact in Germany and the Czech Republic. The settlement of derivatives also adversely affected sales owing to sharply lower commodity prices relative to the prior year.\n\nSales recorded at Corporate Functions/Other of \u20ac11.4 billion were about \u20ac15 billion under the prior-year figure. The decrease is mainly attributable to lower price levels compared with the prior year on commodity transactions conducted by E.ON Energy Markets, our central commodity procurement unit.\n\n## External Sales\n\n|                             | Fourth quarter   | Fourth quarter   | Fourth quarter   | Full year   | Full year   | Full year   |\n|-----------------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|\n| \u20ac in millions               | 2023             | 2022             | +/- %            | 2023        | 2022        | +/- %       |\n| Energy Networks             | 4,989            | 3,995            | 25               | 17,616      | 14,028      | 26          |\n| Germany                     | 3,908            | 3,123            | 25               | 13,609      | 11,185      | 22          |\n| Sweden                      | 242              | 264              | -8               | 986         | 1,002       | -2          |\n| ECE/Turkey                  | 839              | 608              | 38               | 3,021       | 1,841       | 64          |\n| Customer Solutions          | 16,557           | 21,502           | -23              | 64,624      | 74,872      | -14         |\n| Germany                     | 6,968            | 8,380            | -17              | 25,314      | 29,518      | -14         |\n| United Kingdom              | 5,601            | 6,770            | -17              | 23,969      | 25,422      | -6          |\n| The Netherlands             | 1,036            | 1,890            | -45              | 4,201       | 5,227       | -20         |\n| Other                       | 2,952            | 4,462            | -34              | 11,140      | 14,705      | -24         |\n| Corporate Functions/Other 1 | 2,895            | 8,570            | -66              | 11,445      | 26,760      | -57         |\n| Consolidation               | 2                | 0                | 0                | 1           | 0           | 0           |\n| E.ON Group                  | 24,443           | 34,067           | -28              | 93,686      | 115,660     | -19         |\n\n1 Prior-year figures were adjusted owing to the transfer of Non-Core Business.",

It consisted predominantly of network investments as well as ongoing and completed IT projects.\n\nOther operating income totaled \u20ac38,888 million in 2023 (prior year: \u20ac73,193 million). Income from derivative financial instruments alone declined by \u20ac32,961 million year on year to \u20ac37,273 million, principally because of the development of prices on commodity markets during the course of the year. Income from currency-translation effects (\u20ac578 million) was \u20ac275 million below the prior-year figure (\u20ac853 million). Corresponding amounts resulting from currency-translation effects and derivative financial instruments are recorded under other operating expenses. Income from the sale of equity interests and securities totaled \u20ac151 million (prior year: \u20ac999 million). The prior-year figure mainly consists of an \u20ac810 million book gain on the partial disposal of Westconnect GmbH.\n\nCosts of materials of \u20ac64,228 million were significantly below the prior-year level (\u20ac108,627 million). The sharp decline mainly reflects price developments on commodity markets. As part of our long-term procurement strategy, the rise in energy prices in the first half of the prior year continued, now with a time delay, to lead to higher contractually agreed-on procurement costs, whereas price levels in 2023 largely moved lower. A countervailing effect resulted from the fact that forward procurement contacts, which under IFRS are accounted for as derivative financial instruments, are, at the time of settlement, adjusted to the market price at the time of delivery, which has a corresponding impact on costs of materials. Effects from the marking to market of commodity derivatives are recorded under other operating income. In addition, costs of materials include a change in provisions for pending\n\ntransactions. These provisions are mainly recorded for contracted sales transactions that are not subject to IFRS 9 (failed own-use) transactions that are commercially part of a portfolio that is partially offset by procurement transactions that are accounted for as derivative financial instruments.\n\nPersonnel costs of \u20ac6,010 million were \u20ac573 million above the prior-year figure (\u20ac5,437 million). The change is mainly attributable to an increase in the number of employees and to pay increases under collective-bargaining agreements. This was partially offset by lower expenditures for pensions.\n\nDepreciation charges increased from \u20ac3,378 million in the prior year to \u20ac3,514 million. This is principally attributable to higher depreciation charges on property, plant, and equipment due to additional investments in the network business. Countervailing effects mainly involved intangible assets due to the absence of depreciation charges on residual power output rights. In addition, there were higher impairment charges on property, plant, and equipment and intangible assets.\n\nOther operating expenses of \u20ac59,548 million were \u20ac12,188 million below the prior-year figure (\u20ac71,736 million), in particular because expenditures relating to derivative financial instruments (including currency-translation changes) declined by \u20ac13,318 million to \u20ac53,345 million. Expenditures relating to currencytranslation effects increased by \u20ac194 million to \u20ac718 million.\n\nIncome from companies accounted for under the equity method of \u20ac478 million was significantly above the prior-year level (\u20ac279 million). The increase resulted mainly from higher earnings from equity interests in Germany and Slovakia.",

In Germany higher investments were the driver of this positive performance. They led to a continued growth in the regulated asset base. In addition, the recovery of the market environment of the energy-industry contributed to a significant reduction in the costs for redispatch. These cost reductions are temporary in nature and, because of regulatory mechanisms, will be credited to network customers in subsequent years. Adjusted EBITDA in Sweden and at East-Central Europe/Turkey received additional support in all regions except Hungary from lower costs for network losses during 2023 as well as catch-up effects for only partly covered costs for network losses incurred in prior years. The weak Swedish krona and Turkish lira had an off-setting effect. Earnings were also adversely impacted by lower wheeling volume resulting from a reduction in energy consumption. Effects relating to fluctuations in wheeling volume are essentially temporary in nature and, in most countries, are recovered in subsequent years through regulatory mechanisms.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA at Customer Solutions rose by \u20ac1,121 million to \u20ac2,807 million (prior year: \u20ac1,686 million). The increasing stabilization of the energy-industry market environment, which had been under considerable strain in the prior year, was among the contributing factors and had a positive impact on earnings. The stabilization of price levels on procurement markets contributed to an earnings improvement relative to the prior year in nearly all E.ON markets. In addition, energy procurement in the United Kingdom, Germany, and the Netherlands was adjusted to current market conditions, and one-off effects from prior periods had a positive impact as well along with non-recurring regulation effects in the United Kingdom. A decline in sales volume and risk provisions for bad debts had a countervailing effect in nearly all\n\n## Adjusted EBITDA\n\n|                                                  | Fourth quarter   | Fourth quarter   | Fourth quarter   | Full year   | Full year   | Full year   |\n|--------------------------------------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|\n| \u20ac in millions                                    | 2023             | 2022             | +/- %            | 2023        | 2022        | +/- %       |\n| Energy Networks                                  | 1,784            | 1,390            | 28               | 6,640       | 5,459       | 22          |\n| Germany                                          | 1,356            | 1041             | 30               | 5,034       | 4153        | 21          |\n| Sweden                                           | 118              | 92               | 28               | 576         | 452         | 27          |\n| ECE/Turkey                                       | 310              | 257              | 21               | 1,030       | 854         | 21          |\n| Customer Solutions                               | -182             | 269              | -168             | 2,807       | 1,686       | 66          |\n| Thereof: Energy Infrastructure Solutions (\"EIS\") | 146              | 203              | -28              | 525         | 568         | -8          |\n| Germany                                          | -67              | 285              | -124             | 993         | 760         | 31          |\n| United Kingdom                                   | -161             | -302             | 47               | 810         | 208         | 289         |\n| The Netherlands                                  | -46              | 115              | -140             | 227         | 324         | -30         |\n| Other                                            | 92               | 171              | -46              | 777         | 394         | 97          |\n| Corporate Functions/Other 1                      | -26              | 291              | -109             | -79         | 918         | -109        |\n| Consolidation                                    | 5                | -1               | 600              | 2           | -4          | 150         |\n| E.ON Group                                       | 1,581            | 1,949            | -19              | 9,370       | 8,059       | 16          |\n\n1 Prior-year figures were adjusted owing to the transfer of Non-Core Business.\n\nregions. In addition, effects from mild weather in the Netherlands were less pronounced than in the prior year. The in some cases tense situation in Romania in 2022 in the Other unit eased as a result of improvements in the regulatory scheme. In addition, wider margins and effects from portfolio management led to earnings increases in the Other unit's other markets. Adjusted EBITDA at Energy Infrastructure Solutions' ('EIS') business of providing on-site energy solutions was below the prior year due to adverse currency-translation effects and the non-recurrence of positive one-off effects.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA recorded at Corporate Functions/Other declined by about \u20ac1,000 million to -\u20ac79 million (prior year: \u20ac918 million), mainly because of the absence of earnings streams from PreussenElektra, due to the cessation of operations and the dismantling of all power stations. PreussenElektra's earnings are recorded under non-operating expense/income effective the beginning of 2023.\n\nE.ON generates a large portion of its adjusted EBITDA in very stable businesses. Regulated, quasi-regulated, and long-term contracted businesses accounted for the overwhelming proportion of E.ON's adjusted EBITDA in 2023.\n\nE.ON's regulated business consists, among other things, of operations in which revenues are largely set by law and based on costs. The earnings on these revenues are therefore extremely stable and predictable. E.ON's quasi-regulated and long-term contracted business consists of operations in which earnings have a high degree of predictability because key determinants (price and/or volume) are largely set for the medium to long term. Examples include the operation of industrial customer solutions with long-term supply agreements and the operation of heating networks.\n\nMerchant activities are all those that cannot be subsumed under either of the other two categories.",

The improvement is attributable to our good operating performance in the year under review. Based on E.ON stock outstanding, adjusted earnings per share ('EPS') amounted to \u20ac1.18 (prior year: \u20ac1.05).\n\nOperating depreciation charges rose relative to the prior year, from \u20ac2,862 million to \u20ac2,983 million. This is mainly attributable to an increase in depreciation charges on property, plant, and equipment resulting from additional investments in the network business. Countervailing effects mainly involved intangible assets due to the absence of depreciation charges on residual power output rights.\n\nEconomic net interest rose from \u20ac890 million to \u20ac1,082 million, primarily because of the accretion of provisions due to the increase in interest-rate levels at the end of 2022. In addition, the higher interest expense on newly issued bonds due to higher interest rates exceeded the positive effects of bond repayments.\n\n## Adjusted Net Income\n\n|                                                              | 4.

The tax expense on operating earnings rose from \u20ac1,062 million to \u20ac1,325 million owing to the increase in pretax earnings.\n\nNon-controlling interests' share of operating earnings rose significantly-from \u20ac517 million to \u20ac912 million-mainly because of higher operating earnings at companies at the network business in Germany with a significant proportion of non-controlling interests.

These non-operating items are considered separately in internal management control. Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted net income reflect the E.ON Group's long-term profitability and, as metrics for internal management control, are adjusted to exclude nonoperating items.\n\nNet book gains/losses were minor in 2023 and resulted mainly from the combination of VSEH and ZSE in Slovakia. Book gains in the prior year consist in particular of the partial disposal of Westconnect.\n\nRestructuring expenses in the 2023 financial year were below those of the prior year and included, as in the prior year, primarily expenditures in conjunction with the restructuring of the sales business in the United Kingdom.\n\nEffects in conjunction with derivative financial instruments changed by \u20ac1,110 million to -\u20ac4,233 million. The reason was that prices on commodity markets decreased almost continually during the year, which led to declining fair value measurements on forward procurement contracts.\n\nNon-operating expense/income mainly consists of earnings effects of -\u20ac229 million (prior year: \u20ac286 million) at shareholdings in Turkey accounted for using the equity method in conjunction with the application of IAS 29 and a significantly lower valuation effect of -\u20ac130 million (prior year: \u20ac410 million). PreussenElektra's earnings, which are disclosed as non-operating income effective 2023, had a countervailing effect (\u20ac289 million).\n\n## Non-Operating Adjustments\n\n|                                                                                     | Fourth quarter   | Fourth quarter   | Full year   | Full year   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|------------------|-------------|-------------|\n| \u20ac in millions                                                                       | 2023             | 2022             | 2023        | 2022        |\n| Net book gains (+)/losses (-)                                                       | 12               | 807              | 5           | 748         |\n| Restructuring expenses                                                              | 4                | -3               | -22         | -88         |\n| Effects from derivative financial instruments                                       | -1,587           | -4,394           | -4,233      | -3,123      |\n| Carryforward of hidden reserves (+) and liabilities (-) from the innogy transaction | 13               | -31              | -100        | -112        |\n| Other non-operating earnings                                                        | -219             | -217             | -237        | -961        |\n| Non-operating adjustments of EBITDA                                                 | -1,777           | -3,838           | -4,587      | -3,536      |\n| Depreciation of hidden reserves (-) and liabilities (+) from the innogy transaction | -107             | -115             | -448        | -504        |\n| Other non-operating impairments/reversals                                           | -112             | -64              | -156        | -86         |\n| Non-operating interest expense (-)/income (+)                                       | -514             | 484              | -12         | 1,817       |\n| Non-operating taxes                                                                 | 1,539            | 738              | 1,922       | 1,306       |\n| Non-operating adjustments of net income/loss                                        | -971             | -2,795           | -3,281      | -1,003      |\n\n## Reconciliation to Adjusted EBITDA\n\n|                                                                                              | Fourth quarter   | Fourth quarter   | Full year   | Full year   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|------------------|-------------|-------------|\n| \u20ac in millions                                                                                | 2023             | 2022             | 2023        | 2022        |\n| Adjusted EBITDA                                                                              | 1,581            | 1,949            | 9,370       | 8,059       |\n| Non-operating adjustments of EBITDA                                                          | -1,777           | -3,838           | -4,587      | -3,536      |\n| Income/loss from continuing operations before depreciation, interest result and income taxes | -196             | -1,889           | 4,783       | 4,523       |\n| Scheduled depreciation/impairments and amortization/reversals                                | -1,076           | -966             | -3,588      | -3,453      |\n| Income/loss from continuing operations before interest results and income taxes              | -1,272           | -2,855           | 1,195       | 1,070       |",

An increase in interest rates in the prior year led to income from accruals on non-current provisions for asset-retirement obligations, provisions for recultivation and remediation obligations, and other noncurrent provisions. In the interim interest rates declined relative to prior-year balance-sheet date. By contrast, E.ON recorded positive valuation effect on securities recognized at fair value. The positive effect of \u20ac187 million (prior year: \u20ac204 million) from the difference between the nominal interest rate and the effective interest rate of former innogy bonds adjusted due to the purchaseprice allocation is still recorded under non-operating interest expense/income.\n\nThe non-operating tax result is primarily influenced by the fair value measurement of commodity derivatives in various countries with different tax rates and by reversals of deferred taxes due to the improved earnings situation in Germany and the United Kingdom and taxes for previous years mainly from changes in tax provisions.\n\nBesides the above-described non-operating earnings items in the reconciliation to adjusted EBITDA, the reconciliation to adjusted net income includes the following items:\n\n## Reconciliation of Adjusted Net Income\n\n|                                                              | Fourth quarter   | Fourth quarter   | Full year   | Full year   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|------------------|-------------|-------------|\n| \u20ac in millions                                                | 2023             | 2022             | 2023        | 2022        |\n| Adjusted net income                                          | 127              | 602              | 3,068       | 2,728       |\n| Operating earnings attributable to non-controlling interests | 235              | 153              | 912         | 517         |\n| Non-operating adjustments of net income                      | -971             | -2,795           | -3,281      | -1,003      |\n| Income from continuing operations                            | -609             | -2,040           | 699         | 2,242       |\n| Income/loss from discontinued operations, net                | -                | -                | 61          | -           |\n| Net income                                                   | -609             | -2,040           | 760         | 2,242       |\n\nNon-controlling interests' share of operating earnings rose from \u20ac517 million to \u20ac912 million mainly because of higher operating earnings at companies at the network business in Germany with a significant proportion of non-controlling interests. This development resulted from a larger regulated asset base compared with the prior year and the recording of a price-driven increase in network fees.\n\nIncome from discontinued operations resulted from a transaction already completed in 2005. In accordance with the purchase agreement, a one-time purchase-price adjustment was made after an audit of the divested company was completed in the first quarter of 2023, and the contractual clause now took effect.\n\nGroup net income and corresponding earnings per share amounted to \u20ac760 million and \u20ac0.20, respectively, in the 2023 financial year. The decline is mainly attributable to interest-rate developments and price developments on commodity markets. Prior-year net income and earnings per share were \u20ac2,242 million and \u20ac0.70, respectively.",

At the forefront of this strategy is ensuring that E.ON always has access to capital markets commensurate with its debt level.\n\nWith its target capital structure E.ON aims to sustainably secure a strong BBB/Baa rating.\n\nE.ON manages its capital structure using debt factor, which is equal to economic net debt divided by adjusted EBITDA; it is therefore a dynamic debt metric. Economic net debt includes not only financial liabilities but also provisions for pensions and assetretirement obligations.\n\nEconomic net debt also includes provisions for asset-retirement obligations. If the figures for these provisions shown in the balance are larger than the respective amount of the obligation (without factoring in discounting and cost-escalation effects), the amount of the obligation-rather than provision shown in the balance sheets-is factored into economic net income. This is the case for asset-retirement obligations in the nuclear energy unit effective December 31, 2023. For purposes of management control, the amount of the obligations is therefore again used to calculate economic net debt.\n\nPursuant to IFRS valuation standards, innogy's financial liabilities at the time of initial consolidation were recorded at their fair value. This fair value is significantly higher than the original nominal value because interest-rate levels have declined since innogy's bonds were issued. The purchase-price allocation yielded a difference between the nominal value and the fair value, which results in additional liabilities of \u20ac1.5 billion at year-end 2023. This amount will be recorded in financial earnings as a reduction in expenditures and spread out over the maturity period of the respective bonds (see Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. These balance-sheet and earnings effects do not alter\n\nthe interest and principal payments. To manage economic net debt, E.ON continues to use the nominal amount of financial liabilities, which deviates from the figure shown in its balance sheets.\n\nE.ON aims for a debt factor of up to 5.0. Debt factor at year-end 2023 of 4.0 was significantly below the maximum allowable figure.\n\n## Economic Net Debt\n\nEconomic net debt increased by \u20ac5 billion relative to year-end 2022 (\u20ac32.7 billion) to \u20ac37.7 billion.\n\nFinancial liabilities of \u20ac33.9 billion reflect E.ON SE's issuance of bonds in the year under review as well as the repayment of five bonds (details on the next page).\n\nE.ON's net financial position declined by \u20ac3.8 billion compared with year-end 2022 to about -\u20ac25.3 billion. Investment expenditures and E.ON SE's dividend payment exceeded operating cash flow and disposals.\n\nThe decrease in actuarial discount rates for pensions, which led to an increase in defined benefit obligations, did not offset the positive development of plan assets and, on balance, had an adverse impact on economic net debt (see Note 25 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Despite the effects of accruals and the change in interest rates, the slight decrease in provisions for asset-retirement obligations mainly resulted from the utilization of provisions for asset-retirement obligations in the nuclear energy unit, which offset these effects (see Note 26 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Because the utilization affects operating cash flow, however, the economic net debt was negatively affected by the interest-rate effects.\n\n## Economic Net Debt\n\n|                                | December 31,   | December 31,   |\n|--------------------------------|----------------|----------------|\n| \u20ac in millions                  | 2023           | 2022           |\n| Liquid funds                   | 7,412          | 9,378          |\n| Non-current securities         | 1,177          | 1,347          |\n| Financial liabilities 1        | -33,943        | -32,483        |\n| FX hedging adjustment          | 11             | 196            |\n| Net financial position         | -25,343        | -21,562        |\n| Provisions for pensions        | -4,985         | -3,735         |\n| Asset-retirement obligations 2 | -7,363         | -7,445         |\n| Economic net debt              | -37,691        | -32,742        |\n\n1 Bonds previously issued by innogy are recorded at their nominal value. The figure shown in the Consolidated Balance Sheets is \u20ac1.5 billion higher (year-end 2022: \u20ac1.7 billion higher).\n\n2 The figure for asset-retirement obligations at December 31, 2023, does not fully correspond to the figure shown in the Consolidated Balance Sheets (\u20ac7,375 million at  December 31, 2023). This is because economic net debt is calculated in part based on the actual amount of E.ON's obligations. The figure at December 31, 2022, corresponded to the figure shown in the Consolidated Balance Sheets (\u20ac7,445 million).\n\n## Funding Policy and Initiatives\n\nThe key objective of E.ON's funding policy is for the Company to have access to a variety of financing sources at all times. E.ON achieves this objective by using different markets and debt instruments to maximize the diversity of its investor base. E.ON issues bonds with tenors that give its debt portfolio a balanced maturity profile. Moreover, large-volume euro-denominated benchmark issues may in some cases be combined with bonds denominated in foreign currencies, smaller euro-denominated issues, private placements, and/or promissory notes. Furthermore, from 2019 onward E.ON has issued green bonds and has since established them in its financing mix. E.ON continues to intend to cover more than 50 percent of its annual long-term financing requirements with green bonds (the 'E.ON on Capital Markets' chapter contains information about the E.ON Green Bond Framework).",

In the past, external funding was also carried out by the Company's Dutch finance subsidiary, E.ON International Finance B.V. ('EIF'), under guarantee of E.ON SE. In 2023 E.ON paid back in full maturities of \u20ac2.6 billion. E.ON issued new debt totaling \u20ac3.3 billion (see the chapter entitled Special Events in the Reporting Period), of which \u20ac2.5 billion were green bonds.\n\nWith the exception of a U.S.-dollar-denominated bond issued in 2008, all of E.ON SE and EIF's currently outstanding bonds were issued under a Debt Issuance Program ('DIP'). Similarly, innogy and innogy Finance B.V. bonds were formerly issued under the former innogy Group's DIP. A DIP simplifies a company's ability to issue debt to investors in public and private placements in flexible time frames. E.ON SE's DIP was last updated in March 2023 with a total volume of \u20ac35 billion, of which about \u20ac19.7 billion was utilized at year-end 2023 E.ON SE intends to renew the DIP in 2024.\n\nIn addition to its DIP, E.ON has a \u20ac10 billion Commercial Paper ('CP') program and a US$10 billion CP program, under which it can issue short-term notes. After years of inactivity, the U.S. dollar CP program was utilized again in 2023. \u20ac0.2 billion of CP was outstanding at year-end 2023 (prior year: \u20ac0.8 billion).\n\nE.ON also has access to \u20ac3.5 billion syndicated credit facility, which was concluded on October 24, 2019. It originally had a fiveyear term and includes two options to extend the facility, in each case for one year. After both options to extend the facility were exercised, the term of the credit facility ends on October 24, 2026. The credit margin is linked, among other things, to the development of certain ESG ratings, which gives E.ON financial incentives to pursue a sustainable corporate strategy. The ESG ratings are set by three renowned agencies: ISS ESG, MSCI ESG Research, and Sustainalytics. The facility serves as a reliable, ongoing general liquidity reserve for the E.ON Group and can be drawn on as needed. The credit facility is made available by 21 banks which constitute E.ON's core group of banks.\n\n## Financial Liabilities\n\n|                   | December 31,   | December 31,   |\n|-------------------|----------------|----------------|\n| \u20ac in billions     | 2023           | 2022           |\n| Bonds 1           | 27.9           | 27.2           |\n| EUR               | 20.5           | 19.3           |\n| GBP               | 5.7            | 6.1            |\n| USD               | 0.9            | 1.0            |\n| JPY               | 0.3            | 0.3            |\n| Other currencies  | 0.6            | 0.6            |\n| Promissory notes  | -              | -              |\n| Commercial paper  | 0.2            | 0.8            |\n| Other liabilities | 5.8            | 4.5            |\n| Total             | 33.9           | 32.5           |\n\n1 Includes private placements.\n\nAlongside financial liabilities, E.ON has, in the course of its business operations, entered into contingencies and other financial obligations. These include, in particular, guarantees, obligations from legal disputes and damage claims, as well as current and non-current contractual, legal, and other obligations. Notes 27, 28, and 32 to the Consolidated Financial Statements contain more information about E.ON's bonds as well as liabilities, contingencies, and other commitments.\n\nE.ON's creditworthiness has been assessed by Standard & Poor's ('S&P'), Moody's and Fitch with long-term ratings of BBB, Baa2, and BBB+ (A- for bonds), respectively. The outlook for all ratings is stable. The ratings are based on the expectation that, over the near to medium term, E.ON will be able to maintain a debt ratio commensurate with these ratings.

Alongside the ongoing dialog with capital market investors (at road shows, for example) and rating analysts, E.ON organizes events that include an annual informational meeting for its core group of banks.\n\n## Investments\n\nThe E.ON Group's cash-effective investments of \u20ac6.4 billion in 2023 were significantly above the prior-year figure of \u20ac4.8 billion. \u20ac6 billion (prior year: \u20ac4.6 billion) went toward property, plant, and equipment and intangible assets, whereas share investments totaled about \u20ac411 million (prior year: \u20ac177 million).\n\n## Investments\n\n| \u20ac in millions                                     | 2023   | 45291  2022   |\n|---------------------------------------------------|--------|---------------|\n| Energy Networks                                   | 5,156  | 3,845         |\n| Customer Solutions                                | 1,124  | 831           |\n| Thereof: Energy Infrastructure Solutions  (\"EIS\") | 684    | 523           |\n| Corporate Functions/Other 1                       | 141    | 76            |\n| Consolidation                                     | -      | 1             |\n| E.ON Group                                        | 6,421  | 4,753         |\n\n1Prior-year figures were adjusted owing to the transfer of Non-Core Business.\n\nThe strategic focus of our investment activity is Energy Networks. This segment's investments rose by 34 percent to \u20ac5.2 billion (prior year: \u20ac3.8 billion). The main focus in all regions was on new connections and network expansion in conjunction with the energy transition.\n\nCustomer Solutions' investments increased by 35 percent to \u20ac1.1 billion (prior year: \u20ac0.8 billion). Fully \u20ac0.7 billion (prior year: \u20ac0.5 billion) of total investments went toward Energy Infrastructure Solutions ('EIS') across all regions. This increase is attributable in particular to higher investments in the smart energy meter business in the United Kingdom and the acquisition of Equans Energy Solutions ('EES'). EES offers aquifer thermal energy storage ('ATES') in the Netherlands and focuses on low-carbon heat and cooling solutions for existing residential and business buildings. In addition, investments to decarbonize the heat and power generation of municipalities and industrial customers in Germany were increased.\n\nInvestments at Corporate Functions/Other of \u20ac141 million (prior year: \u20ac76 million) went especially toward intangible assets and other shareholdings.\n\n## Cash Flow\n\nCash provided by operating activities of continuing operations before interest and taxes of \u20ac7.2 billion was \u20ac4.3 billion below the prior-year figure (\u20ac11.5 billion). This resulted in part from a decline of \u20ac0.9 billion at Energy Networks, which is mainly attributable to adverse changes in working capital at the network business in Germany. In particular, back payments to energy feed-in customers who had received insufficient installment payments in the previous year had a negative impact on operating cash flow in the year under review. The remaining decline (a total of -\u20ac3.4 billion) came from Customer Solutions and Corporate Functions/Other and was likewise mainly due to negative changes in working capital in the 2023 financial year that more than offset the increase in cash-effective earnings. These negative changes in working capital are mainly attributable to the timing difference between customer installment payments already received in 2022 and payments from government support measures and the related cash outflows from commodity procurement in the year under review. In addition, the closure of E.ON's last nuclear power plant in the 2023 financial year led to a further deterioration of cash provided by operating activities relative to the prior year.\n\nCash provided by investing activities of continuing operations of -\u20ac5.6 billion was 2.4 billion below the prior-year figure of -\u20ac3.2 billion. This includes cash-effective investments of \u20ac6.4 billion (prior year: \u20ac4.8 billion). The increase is primarily attributable to the planned increase in investments in property, plant, and equipment and intangible assets, particularly at the network business Germany. A reduction in cash inflow from disposals also affected cash provided by investment activities. There was no transaction in the 2023 financial year comparable to the sale of E.ON's 50 percent stake in Westconnect in the prior year.",

The net of the issuance and repayment of bonds, commercial paper, and bank liabilities led to an improvement in cash provided by financing activities. A net reduction in adverse effects in conjunction with variation margins due to the settlement of derivative transactions led to a further improvement in cash provided by financing activities.\n\n## Cash-Conversion Rate\n\nCash-conversion rate ('CCR') indicates how much of the E.ON Group's earnings are transformed into cash flow. CCR is equal to operating cash flow before interest and taxes divided by adjusted EBITDA. Cash outflows for the decommissioning of nuclear power plants were excluded from CCR until 2022. Because the earnings streams from PreussenElektra's generation activities are no longer included in adjusted EBITDA due to the discontinuation of power operations effective December 31, 2022, CCR was adjusted for the 2023 financial year. Cash flows of \u20ac271 million included in operating cash flow before interest and taxes in conjunction with the decommissioning of nuclear power plants and their temporary continued operation from January 1 to April 15, 2023, were not factored into the calculation of CCR. E.ON's CCR in 2023 was 80 percent (prior year: 151 percent).",

Noncurrent assets rose by \u20ac1.3 billion to \u20ac83 billion. This is mainly attributable to an increase in investments in property, plant, and equipment as well as a rise in the book value of companies valued using the equity method. This was mainly due to the addition of VSEH at Z\u00e1padoslovensk\u00e1 energetika a.s. ('ZSE') and the application of IAS 29 in Turkey. By contrast, receivables from derivative financial instruments declined. This relates in particular to the development of commodity derivatives. In addition, deferred tax assets increased owing to the development of derivatives and the reversal of deferred tax assets in the E.ON SE's tax group.\n\nCurrent assets decreased by 41.7 percent, from \u20ac52.2 billion to \u20ac30.5 billion. This likewise resulted mainly from the decline in receivables on derivative financial instruments due to developments on commodity markets and from a reduction in liquid funds caused by higher investments and dividend payments.\n\nEquity attributable to E.ON SE shareholders was about \u20ac14.1 billion at year-end 2023 (prior year: about \u20ac15.9 billion), whereas equity attributable to non-controlling interests was roughly \u20ac5.9 billion (prior year: about \u20ac5.9 billion). The equity ratio (including non-controlling interests) at year-end 2023 was about 18 percent, which is 2 percentage points higher than at year-end 2022. The primary reason for the decline in equity was the reduction in net income, the dividend payment along with the remeasurement of pension obligations. In addition, other income and expenses decreased because of the recycling of the cash flow hedge relationships for commodity derivatives that were unwound in the prior year.\n\nNon-current debt declined by \u20ac2 billion, or 3.5 percent, chiefly because of the development of liabilities relating to derivative financial instruments and a decline in other provisions for contingent losses from pending transactions because of their utilization following the settlement of the underlying transactions. An increase in provisions for pensions due to lower interest rates and an increase in financial liabilities had a countervailing effect.\n\nCurrent debt of \u20ac37.6 billion was 30.6 percent below the figure at year-end 2022, due principally to a decrease in liabilities relating to derivative financial instruments, which is likewise due to developments on commodity markets, and a decrease in liabilities from trade accounts payable.\n\n## Consolidated Assets, Liabilities, and Equity\n\n| \u20ac in millions                | Dec. 31, 2023   |     | %    Dec. 31, 2022   |   % |\n|------------------------------|-----------------|-----|----------------------|-----|\n| Non-current assets           | 83,034          |  73 | 81,769               |  61 |\n| Current assets               | 30,472          |  27 | 52,240               |  39 |\n| Total assets                 | 113,506         | 100 | 134,009              | 100 |\n| Equity                       | 19,970          |  18 | 21,867               |  16 |\n| Non-current liabilities      | 55,923          |  49 | 57,934  1            |  43 |\n| Current liabilities          | 37,613          |  33 | 54,208  1            |  41 |\n| Total equity and liabilities | 113,506         | 100 | 134,009              | 100 |\n\n1 Adjusted (see also page 136).\n\nThe Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements contain more commentary on E.ON's asset situation.",

KG ('MEON') into E.ON SE, the acquiring entity, on August 28, 2023, resulted in MEON's business assets accruing to E.ON as part of the universal succession.  The accrual limits individual line items' comparability with the prior year.\n\nThe increase in financial assets consists mainly of an increase in loans to affiliated companies (\u20ac1,451 million) and an increase in securities held as fixed assets due to the MEON accrual (\u20ac985 million). A decline in stakes in affiliated companies due to the MEON accrual (-\u20ac1,371 million) was a countervailing factor.\n\nThe increase in receivables from affiliated companies is mainly attributable to higher receivables from profit-pooling agreements with subsidiaries (\u20ac842 million). The decline in other liabilities results mainly from a reduction in the amount in money market funds (-\u20ac1,279 million).\n\nThe change in equity reflects a \u20ac650 million increase in retained earnings resulting from changes in treasury shares under the employee stock-purchase program conducted in 2023 (\u20ac15 million) along with a \u20ac28 million decrease in net income available for distribution.\n\nThe increase in provisions results mainly from the provisions for pensions added from MEON at the date of the accrual (\u20ac2,722 million).\n\nE.ON SE issued new bonds and commercial paper in the amount of \u20ac3,300 million in the 2023 financial year and repaid bonds in the amount of \u20ac1,750 million. In addition, liabilities from commercial paper declined by \u20ac559 million. The decrease in liabilities to affiliated companies of \u20ac3,484 million reflects a decline in intraGroup financing.\n\nInformation on treasury shares can be found in Note 11 to the Financial Statements of E.ON SE and Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Income Statement of E.ON SE (Summary)\n\n| \u20ac in millions                               | 2023   | 2022   |\n|---------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Income from equity interests                | 4,011  | 2,954  |\n| Financial result                            | -743   | -876   |\n| Other expenditures and income               | -1,155 | -635   |\n| Taxes                                       | -160   | 106    |\n| Net income                                  | 1,953  | 1,549  |\n| Profit carryforward from the prior year     | 1,494  | 1,276  |\n| Net income transferred to retained earnings | -650   | 0      |\n| Net income available for distribution       | 2,797  | 2,825  |\n\nE.ON SE is the parent company of the E.ON Group. As such, its earnings situation is affected by income from equity interests. The main contributors to positive income from equity interests were income from the transfer of profits from E.ON Beteiligungen GmbH in the amount of \u20ac2,174 million, E.ON Finanzanlagen GmbH in the amount of \u20ac1,030 million, and E.ON Energie AG in the amount of \u20ac764 million.\n\nThe financial result for 2023 includes a deterioration in net interest expense of \u20ac516 million, mainly due to the increase in interest rates. By contrast, the prior-year financial result was adversely affected by expenses from impairment charges on equity interests in affiliated companies (\u20ac649 million).\n\nThe negative balance of other income and expenses in 2023 resulted primarily from \u20ac489 million in losses due to the transfer of MEON Pensions GmbH & Co. KG to E.ON SE, \u20ac265 million in personnel-related expenses, \u20ac225 million in expenses for purchased third-party services, \u20ac64 million in auditing and consulting services, and \u20ac174 million in net expenses from currency effects. The increase in the provision for recultivation and remediation obligations in 2023 reflected expenditures of \u20ac16 million (prior year: \u20ac109 million).",

In addition, E.ON SE provides a relatively limited degree of energy-specific services to affiliated network operators for network operations relating to electricity distribution and/or gas distribution and prepares activity statements for these services. The resulting earnings, individually and in total, are minimal (about -\u20ac0.2 million).\n\nIn the year under review, total tax expenses amounted to \u20ac160 million relating to taxes for the current financial year as well as taxes for prior years. This consists of income tax expense of \u20ac160 million and an expense from other taxes of \u20ac0.2 million.\n\nAt the Annual Shareholders Meeting in 2024, the Management Board will propose that net income available for distribution be used to pay a dividend of \u20ac0.53 per ordinary share and the remaining amount of \u20ac1,412 million to be carried forward to the next financial year. Management's proposal for the use of net income available for distribution is based on the number of ordinary shares on March 4, 2024, the date the Financial Statements of E.ON SE were prepared.\n\nThe complete Financial Statements of E.ON SE, with an unqualified opinion issued by the auditor, KPMG AG, D\u00fcsseldorf, will be announced in the Federal Gazette ( Bundesanzeiger ).\n\n## Outlook\n\nThe E.ON SE Management Board has decided on a dividend policy that foresees annual growth in the dividend per share of up to 5 percent through the dividend for the 2028 financial year. This also applies to dividend growth of up to 5 percent for the 2024 financial year. E.ON will aim for an annual increase in dividend per share after 2028 as well. In E.ON's strategy, sustainability with an emphasis on climate-neutral economic activities is a key growth factor that will enable E.ON to meet its dividend targets.",

However, the current situation gives forecasts a high degree of uncertainty.\n\nThe forecast for global economic growth in 2024 takes into account stricter financing conditions, weak trade growth amid geopolitical tensions, and the effects of tighter monetary policy. Assuming that inflation continues to fall and real incomes rise, the OECD expects the global economy to grow by 3 percent in 2025. Global goods trade and industrial production are expected to regain momentum owing to the considerable drawdown of companies' inventories, while China's weak economic development will have a dampening effect.\n\nThe European Commission's experts predict that the EU's GDP will grow by 1.3 percent in 2024 and 1.7 percent in 2025.\n\nEconomic institutes anticipate that Germany's economy will begin to recover and grow by 0.9 percent in 2024 and to normalize further in 2025 with GDP growth of 1.3 percent. Declining inflation at the end of 2023, rising incomes, and the high employment rate indicate an increase in purchasing power and overall economic demand, which support these estimates and forecasts.\n\n## General Statement on E.ON's Anticipated Development\n\nThe growth strategy adopted in 2021 as a continuation of the Group's far-reaching transformation in the preceding years proved to be correct and resilient in 2023 as well. In our view, the strategic elements of sustainability and digitalization, which remain valid and underscore E.ON's growth ambitions, are precisely the success factors that will accelerate the transformation of the energy system. We anticipate that in 2024 our operating business will continue to be shaped by a higher level of commodity prices and of inflation and interest rates than before the start of the crisis.\n\n## Anticipated Earnings and Financial Situation\n\n## Forecast Earnings Performance\n\nThe most important key performance indicators for managing the E.ON Group are adjusted EBITDA, investments, and earnings per share from adjusted net income ('EPS'). E.ON expects adjusted Group EBITDA of \u20ac8.8 to \u20ac9.0 billion in the 2024 financial year. It anticipates adjusted net income of \u20ac2.8 to \u20ac3.0 billion, or \u20ac1.07 to \u20ac1.15 per share in 2024 (based on around 2,612 million shares outstanding). We report on the E.ON Group's dividend policy and planned annual dividend growth in the E.ON on Capital Markets chapter.\n\n## Forecast by segment\n\n## Adjusted EBITDA 1 : 2024 Plan\n\n| \u20ac in billions                                 |              |\n|-----------------------------------------------|--------------|\n| Energy Networks                               | 6.7 to 6.9   |\n| Energy Retail (previously Customer Solutions) | 1.6 to 1.8   |\n| Energy Infrastructure Solutions (EIS)         | 0.55 to 0.65 |\n| Corporate Functions/Other                     | about -0.2   |\n| E.ON Group                                    | 8.8 to 9.0   |\n\n1 Adjusted for non-operating effects.\n\nThere are changes to the E.ON Group's segment reporting effective January 1, 2024. The Energy Infrastructure Solutions ('EIS') business, which was previously included in the Customer Solutions segment, has been carved out and will be reported as a separate segment. From 2024 onward, Customer Solutions also includes the activities of E.ON Energy Markets GmbH, our central commodity procurement unit (previously included in Corporate Functions/Other), and, due to its business activities' new profile, has been renamed Energy Retail.\n\nE.ON expects Energy Networks to record an earnings increase in 2024 compared with the past financial year. This performance will result from further growth in the regulated asset base due to additional investments along with positive regulatory changes, particularly in Sweden. In addition, brought forward catch-up effects for costs incurred in prior years for network losses that were not fully covered are expected in Hungary.\n\nEarnings at Energy Retail (formerly Customer Solutions), without the Energy Infrastructure Solutions business, are expected to be significantly below the prior-year level, which will not be significantly altered by the initial inclusion of E.ON Energy Markets GmbH. The non-recurrence of positive one-off effects and the anticipated stabilization of the market environment will have an adverse impact on earnings.",

This is mainly attributable to the higher investment activity of recent years and the related commissioning of new customer projects.\n\nEarnings at Corporate Functions/Other are expected to be below the prior-year level. Lower earnings from generation activities in Turkey and the fact that E.ON Energy Markets GmbH's earnings are now reported at Energy Retail will have an adverse impact.\n\nAdjusted net income and earnings per share from adjusted net income ('EPS') are expected to be below the prior-year level. In addition to the above-described developments in adjusted EBITDA, higher depreciation charges due to increased investments in the energy transition will have a negative impact. This will be partially offset by lower non-controlling interests resulting from a decline in operating earnings from companies with a significant share of minority interests.\n\n## Planned Investments\n\nInvestments in the sustainable expansion and digital transformation of energy networks and customer solutions operations form the basis for the value-driven growth E.ON aims to achieve. Investments of around \u20ac7.2 billion are therefore planned for the 2024 financial year.\n\n## Cash-Effective Investments: 2024 Plan\n\n|                                               | \u20ac in billions   |   Percentages |\n|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------|---------------|\n| Energy Networks                               | ~5.7            |            79 |\n| Energy Retail (previously Customer Solutions) | ~0.5            |             7 |\n| Energy Infrastructure Solutions (EIS)         | ~0.8            |            11 |\n| Corporate Functions/Other                     | ~0.2            |             3 |\n| E.ON Group                                    | ~7.2            |           100 |\n\nE.ON will make most of these investments in its Energy Networks segment, the backbone of a successful energy transition. Investments will go toward expanding, enhancing, and modernizing networks, switching equipment, and metering and control technology in order to ensure the reliable, uninterrupted, and sustainable distribution of electricity and to meet rising energy demand. In addition, E.ON will invest in the digitalization of network planning, monitoring, and control.\n\nInvestments at Energy Infrastructure Solutions will mainly go toward business expansion in our markets in Sweden, Germany, and the United Kingdom.\n\nAt Energy Retail, E.ON will invest in advanced IT platforms, smart charging solutions for eMobility, and integrated energy solutions.\n\nCorporate Functions/Other's investments will go mainly toward Group-wide IT infrastructure and digital platforms for the networks and customer solutions business.",

It provides:\n\n- \u00b7 meaningful information about risks and chances to the business, thereby enabling the business to derive individual risks/chances as well as aggregate risk profiles within the time horizon of the medium-term plan\n- \u00b7 transparency on E.ON's risk position in compliance with legal requirements including KonTraG, BilMoG, and BilReG.\n\nThe ERM is based on a centralized governance approach that defines standardized processes and tools covering the identification, evaluation, countermeasures as well as the monitoring and reporting of risks and chances. Overall governance is provided by the Group Controlling & Risk division's Group Risk & Special Projects department on behalf of the E.ON SE Risk Committee.\n\nAll risks and chances have an accountable member of the Management Board, have a designated risk owner who remains operationally responsible for managing that risk/chance, and are identified in a dedicated bottom-up process.\n\n## Scope\n\nE.ON's risk management system in the broader sense has a total of four components:\n\n- \u00b7 an internal monitoring system\n- \u00b7 a management information system\n- \u00b7 preventive measures\n- \u00b7 the ERM, which is a risk management system in the narrow sense.\n\nThe purpose of the internal monitoring system is to ensure the proper functioning of business processes. This consists of preventive organizational measures (such as policies and work instructions) and internal controls and audits (particularly by Internal Audit).\n\nThe E.ON internal management information system identifies risks early so that steps can be taken to actively address them. Close consultation between the business units and with departments at Corporate Functions such as Controlling, Finance, and Accounting,",

Furthermore, the Company strives to conduct proper project management so as to identify early and minimize the risks attending major investments.\n\nE.ON attempts to minimize the operational risks of legal proceedings and ongoing planning processes by managing them appropriately and by designing appropriate contracts beforehand.\n\n## Managing Operational and IT Risks\n\nTo limit operational and IT risks, E.ON continually improves its network management and the optimal deployment of its assets. At the same time, E.ON implements operational and infrastructure improvements that will enhance the reliability of its generation assets and distribution networks, even under extraordinarily adverse conditions. In addition, E.ON has factored the operational and financial effects of environmental risks into its emergency plan. They are part of a catalog of crisis and system-failure scenarios prepared for the Group by the Incident and Crisis Management team.\n\nE.ON IT systems are maintained and optimized by qualified E.ON Group experts and outside experts, and by a wide range of technological security measures. In addition, the E.ON Group has in place a range of technological and organizational measures to counter the risk of unauthorized access to data, the misuse of data, and data loss.\n\n## Managing Health, Safety, and Environmental ('HSE'), Human Resources ('HR'), and Other Risks\n\nThe following are among the comprehensive measures E.ON takes to address such risks (including in conjunction with operational and IT risks):\n\n- \u00b7 systematic employee training, advanced training, and qualification programs for employees\n- \u00b7 further refinement of production procedures, processes, and technologies\n- \u00b7 regular facility and network maintenance and inspection\n- \u00b7 Company guidelines as well as work and process instructions\n- \u00b7 quality management, control, and assurance\n- \u00b7 project, environmental, and deterioration management\n- \u00b7 crisis-prevention measures and emergency planning\n- \u00b7 management systems for health, safety, and environmental protection certified to ISO standards; in some cases, technical safety management ('TSM') as well\n- \u00b7 defined continual improvement processes ('CIPs').\n\nShould an accident occur despite the measures taken, E.ON has a reasonable level of insurance coverage. Detailed information can be found in various chapters of the Combined Group Management Report.\n\n## Managing Market Risks\n\nE.ON uses a comprehensive sales-management system and extensive customer management to manage margin risks caused by market prices. E.ON conducts systematic risk management to limit exposure to risks of price changes. Its key elements are, in addition to binding Group-wide policies and a Group-wide reporting system, the use of quantitative key figures, the limitation, pricing, and optimization of risks, and the strict separation of functions between departments. Furthermore, E.ON utilizes derivative financial instruments that are commonly used in the marketplace. These instruments are transacted with financial institutions, brokers, power exchanges, and third parties whose creditworthiness is monitored on an ongoing basis. E.ON's local sales units and the remaining generation operations conduct local risk management under central governance standards to monitor these underlying commodity risks and to minimize them through hedging.\n\n## Managing Strategic Risks\n\nE.ON has comprehensive preventive measures in place to manage potential risks relating to acquisitions and investments. These measures include, in addition to the relevant company guidelines and manuals, comprehensive due diligence, legally binding contracts, a multistage approvals process, and shareholding and project controlling. Comprehensive post-acquisition projects also contribute to successful integration.\n\n## Managing Finance and Treasury Risks\n\nThis category encompasses credit, interest-rate, currency, tax, and asset-management risks and chances. E.ON uses systematic risk management to monitor and control its interest-rate and currency risks and manage these risks using derivative and non-derivative financial instruments. Here, E.ON SE plays a central role by aggregating risk positions through intragroup transactions and hedging these risks in the market. Due to E.ON SE's intermediary role, its risk position is largely closed.",

E.ON manages credit risk by taking appropriate measures, which include obtaining collateral and setting limits. The E.ON Group's Risk Committee is regularly informed about credit risks. A further component of E.ON's risk management is a conservative investment strategy for financial funds and a broadly diversified portfolio.\n\nNote 31 to the Consolidated Financial Statements contains detailed information about the use of derivative financial instruments and hedging transactions. Note 32 describes the general principles of E.ON's risk management and applicable risk metrics for quantifying risks relating to commodities, credit, liquidity, interest rates, and currency translation.\n\n## Enterprise Risk Management ('ERM')\n\nE.ON's ERM, which is the basis for the risks and chances described in the next section, encompasses:\n\n- \u00b7 systematic risk and chance identification\n- \u00b7 risk and chance analysis and evaluation\n- \u00b7 management and monitoring of risks and chances by analyzing and evaluating countermeasures and preventive systems\n- \u00b7 documentation and reporting.\n\nAs required by law, E.ON's ERM's effectiveness is reviewed regularly by Internal Audit. In compliance with the provisions of Section 91, Paragraph 2, of the German Stock Corporation Act relating to the establishment of a risk-monitoring and early warning system, E.ON has a Risk Committee for the E.ON Group and for each of its business units. The Risk Committee's mission is to achieve a comprehensive overview of E.ON's risk exposure at\n\nthe Group and unit level and to actively manage risk exposure in line with E.ON's risk strategy.\n\nThe ERM applies to all fully consolidated E.ON Group companies and all companies valued at equity whose gross book value in the Consolidated Financial Statements is greater than \u20ac50 million. E.ON takes an inventory of its risks and chances at each quarterly balance-sheet date.\n\nTo promote uniform financial reporting Group-wide, E.ON has in place a central, standardized system that enables effective and automated risk reporting. Company data are systematically collected, transparently processed, and made available for analysis both centrally and decentrally at the units.\n\n## Risks and Chances\n\n## Methodology\n\nE.ON's IT-based system for reporting risks and chances has the following risk categories and examples:\n\n## Legal and regulatory risks\n\n- \u00b7 Policy and legal risks and chances\n- \u00b7 Regulatory risks\n- \u00b7 Risks from public consent processes\n\n## Operational and IT risks\n\n- \u00b7 IT and process risks and chances\n- \u00b7 Risks and chances relating to asset operations and new-build projects\n\n## HSE, HR, and other\n\n- \u00b7 Health, safety, and environmental risks and chances\n\n## Market risks\n\n- \u00b7 Risks and chances from the development of commodity prices and margins and from changes in market liquidity\n\n## Strategic risks\n\n- \u00b7 Risks and chances from investments and disposals\n\n## Finance and treasury risks\n\n- \u00b7 Credit, interest-rate, foreign-currency, tax, and assetmanagement risks and chances",

Risks and chances are generally reported on the basis of objective evaluations. If this is not possible, estimates by in-house experts are used. The evaluation measures a risk's/chance's financial impact on the current earnings plan while factoring in risk-reducing countermeasures. The evaluation therefore reflects the net risk.\n\nFor quantifiable risks and chances, E.ON then evaluates the likelihood of occurrence and the potential loss or damage. In the commodity business, for example, commodity prices can rise or fall. This type of risk is modeled with a normal distribution. Modeling is supported by a Group-wide IT-based system. Extremely unlikely events-those whose likelihood of occurrence is 5 percent or less-are classified as tail events. Tail events are not included in the simulation described below.\n\nThis statistical distribution makes it possible for E.ON's internal risk management system to conduct a Monte Carlo simulation of these risks. This yields an aggregated risk distribution that is quantified as the deviation from the Company's current earnings plan for adjusted EBITDA.\n\nE.ON uses the 5th and 95th percentiles of this aggregated risk distribution as the worst case and best case, respectively. Statistically, this means that with this risk distribution there is a 90 percent likelihood that the deviation from the Company's current earnings plan for adjusted EBITDA will remain within these extremes.\n\n## Impact Classes\n\n| Low      | x < \u20ac50 million                 |\n|----------|---------------------------------|\n| Moderate | \u20ac50 million \u2264 x < \u20ac200 million  |\n| Medium   | \u20ac200 million \u2264 x < \u20ac500 million |\n| Major    | \u20ac500 million \u2264 x < \u20ac2 billion   |\n| High     | x \u2265 \u20ac2 billion                  |\n\nThe last step is to assign, in accordance with the 5th and 95th percentiles, the aggregated risk distribution to impact classeslow, moderate, medium, major, and high-according to their quantitative impact on planned adjusted EBITDA. The impact classes are shown in the table above.",

It also addresses major/high tail events and major/high qualitative risks. In the case of qualitative risks (which by definition are more difficult to assess both in terms of their loss amount and their probability), a further distinction is made between risks with a low probability (6 percent < x \u2264 25 percent) and a medium probability (26 percent < x \u2264 50 percent). Example: in category x, there is a risk y (medium, high) and a risk z (low, major).\n\nIn the case of tail events and qualitative risks, the focus is not only on E.ON's key performance indicator, adjusted EBITDA, but also on other indicators relating to its asset and financial position.\n\nThe E.ON Group has major risk positions in the following category: market risks. As a result, the aggregate risk position of E.ON SE as a Group is major. In other words, the E.ON Group's maximum annual adjusted EBITDA risk ought not to exceed -\u20ac500 million to -\u20ac2 billion in 95 percent of all cases.\n\nCommodity prices, which rose sharply in 2022 in conjunction with the war in Ukraine, declined significantly in 2023. This has significant positive implications for the assessment of individual risks as well as, on the negative side, individual chances relative to the prior year. On the one hand, commodity prices can affect wheeling volume and prices in the sales business; on the other, it is a material risk factor for possible bad debts in the sales business. Persistently high commodity prices also lead to material counterparty risks; however, our major suppliers' good credit ratings and system relevance continue to render the likelihood of occurrence very low (tail/high).\n\nThe energy network business could likewise experience a decline in wheeling volume, credit losses, price increases for network losses, and redispatch expenditures that lead to lower earnings. A distinctive feature of several of regulatory jurisdictions in Europe in which we operate networks is that regulatory mechanisms generally foresee that a decline in wheeling volume and pricedriven cost increases for network losses can generally be recovered in subsequent years by corresponding adjustments to network tariffs.\n\n## Risks and Chances by Category\n\nE.ON's major risks and chances by risk category are described below. Also described are major risks and chances stemming from tail events as well as qualitative risks that would impact adjusted\n\n## Risk Position\n\n| Risk category              | Worst case (5th percentile)   | Best case (95th percentile)   |\n|----------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|\n| Legal and regulatory risks | Medium                        | Medium                        |\n| Operational and IT risks   | Moderate                      | Low                           |\n| HSE, HR, and other         | Low                           | Low                           |\n| Market risks               | Major                         | Medium                        |\n| Strategic risks            | Moderate                      | Low                           |\n| Finance and treasury risks | Medium                        | Medium                        |\n\nEBITDA by more than \u20ac500 million. Also included are risks and chances that would affect planned net income and/or cash flow.\n\n## Legal and Regulatory Risks\n\nThe political, legal, and regulatory environment in which the E.ON Group does business is a source of risks. This could confront E.ON with direct and indirect consequences that could lead to possible financial disadvantages. New risks-but also opportunities-arise from energy-policy decisions at the European and national level. The Energy Policy and Regulatory Environment chapter contains detailed information about the energy policy environment.\n\nIn the wake of the economic and financial crisis in many EU member states, interventionist policies and regulations have been adopted in recent years, such as additional taxes and additional reporting requirements (for example, EMIR, MAR, REMIT, MiFID2). The relevant agencies monitor compliance with these regulations closely. This leads to attendant risks for E.ON's operations. The same applies to price moratoriums, regulated price reductions, statutory price adjustment requirements, and changes to support schemes for renewables, which could pose risks to, as well as create chances for, E.ON's operations in the respective countries.\n\nThe operation of energy networks is subject to a large degree of government regulation. New laws and regulatory periods cause uncertainty for this business. In addition, matters related to Germany's Renewable Energy Sources Act, such as issues regarding solar energy, can cause temporary fluctuations in cash flow and adjusted EBITDA. The rapid growth of renewables is also creating new risks for the network business. For example, insolvencies among renewables operators or feed-in tariffs unduly paid by grid operators lead to court or regulatory proceedings.\n\nThis risk category also includes major risks arising from possible litigation, fines, and claims; governance and compliance issues; as well as risks and chances related to contracts and permits. Changes to this environment can lead to considerable uncertainty with regard to planning and, under certain circumstances, to",

This results in a medium risk and a medium chance position.\n\nIn addition, the decommissioning of gas networks and attendant possible asset-retirement obligations could pose significant risks for the Energy Networks segment (tail, high).\n\nThe operations of the E.ON Group's Customer Solutions segment subject it to certain risks relating to legal proceedings, ongoing planning processes, and regulatory changes. But these risks also relate, in particular, to legal actions and proceedings concerning contract and price adjustments to reflect market dislocations or (including as a consequence of the energy transition) an altered business climate in the power and gas business, alleged pricerigging, and anticompetitive practices. This poses a major risk (tail/high).\n\nA significant change will result from Germany's implementation of the European Court of Justice's ruling requiring it to form a largely independent national regulatory agency, which could have an impact on E.ON's regulated business activities in Sweden (low/major).\n\nPreussenElektra's business is substantially influenced by regulation as well. This could pose risks for its remaining business and the dismantling of decommissioned nuclear power plants.\n\n## Operational and IT Risks\n\nThe operational and strategic management of the E.ON Group relies heavily on complex information technology ('IT') and complex operational technology ('OT'). Consequently, there are risks and chances in conjunction with information security and the security of operating processes in E.ON's business segments.\n\nCybersecurity and the continuous protection of IT and OT systems against cyberattacks constitute a focus area of E.ON's risk management. Examples include the analysis of attacks on the systems of the network business (which could affect the operation\n\nof E.ON's critical infrastructure), on the sales business (which could result in the loss of customer data), and on internal systems (which E.ON uses to control commercial processes in all its business units). It is important that the operating units and the Cybersecurity and Enterprise Risk Management divisions jointly and proactively evaluate and manage risks for E.ON.\n\nTechnologically complex production facilities are used in the distribution of energy, resulting in major risks from procurement and logistics, construction, the operation and maintenance of assets, as well as general project risks. The risks at PreussenElektra encompass dismantling activities as well. E.ON's operations in and outside Germany face major risks of a power failure as well as higher costs and additional investments resulting from unanticipated operational disruptions or other problems. Operational failures or extended production stoppages of facilities or components of facilities as well as environmental damage could negatively impact earnings, affect the cost situation, and/or result in the imposition of fines. In unlikely cases, this could lead to a high risk. Overall, it results in a moderate risk position and a low chance position in this category. General project risks can include delays and increased capital requirements.\n\nExtraordinary environmental events could also affect the operation of energy networks or equipment and equipment components. This could pose a liquidity risk for E.ON (tail/major).\n\nE.ON could also be subject to environmental liabilities that could have a significant adverse impact on its business. In addition, new or amended environmental laws and regulations may result in cost increases for E.ON.\n\n## HSE, HR, and Other Risks\n\nHealth and occupational safety are important aspects of E.ON's day-to-day business. The Company's operating activities can therefore pose risks in these areas and create social and environmental risks and chances. In addition, E.ON's operating business potentially faces risks resulting from human error and\n\nemployee turnover. It is important that E.ON acts responsibly along its entire value chain and that it communicates consistently, enhances the dialog, and maintains good relationships with key stakeholders. E.ON actively considers environmental, social, and corporate governance issues. These efforts support the Company's business decisions and public relations. E.ON's objective is to minimize reputational risks and retain public acceptance so that the Company can continue to operate its business successfully. These matters result in a low risk and chance position.\n\nIn the past, predecessor entities of E.ON SE conducted mining operations, resulting in obligations in North Rhine-Westphalia and Bavaria (low/major). E.ON SE can be held responsible for damage. This could lead to major individual risks that E.ON currently only evaluates qualitatively.\n\n## Market Risks\n\nE.ON's units operate in an international market environment that is characterized by general risks relating to the business cycle. In addition, the entry of new suppliers into the marketplace along with more aggressive tactics by existing market participants and reputational risks have created a keener competitive environment for the Company's sales business in and outside Germany, which could reduce margins. However, market developments could also have a positive impact on E.ON's business. Such factors include wholesale and retail price developments, customer churn rates, and temporary volume effects in the network business. This results in a major risk and a medium chance position in this category.\n\nThe demand for electric power and natural gas is seasonal, with E.ON's operations generally experiencing higher demand during the cold-weather months of October through March and lower demand during the warm-weather months of April through September. As a result of these seasonal patterns, E.ON's sales and results of operations are higher in the first and fourth quarters and lower in the second and third quarters. E.ON procures the required quantities of electricity and gas for its customers based",

Nevertheless, actual customer demand may deviate from the forecast owing to various factors (such as the weather and the economy). Such deviations could have a positive or negative business impact, particularly in an environment of highly volatile prices. E.ON aims to reduce these impacts by, for example, pursuing a prudent hedging strategy in conjunction with a proactive approach to reforecasting or by pricing its risks vis-\u00e0-vis customers.\n\nAlongside E.ON's own procurement organization for its sales business, the E.ON Energy Markets GmbH ('EEM') subsidiary functions as a central interface to wholesale markets. EEM's main purpose is to consolidate E.ON's commodity positions in order to manage market price risks and to diversify and mitigate credit and margin (cash flow) risks.\n\n## Strategic Risks\n\nE.ON's business strategy involves acquisitions and investments in its core business as well as disposals. This strategy depends in part on the ability to successfully identify, acquire, and integrate such companies that enhance, on acceptable terms, the Company's energy business. In order to obtain the necessary approvals for acquisitions, E.ON may be required to divest other parts of its business or to make concessions or undertakings that affect its business. In addition, there can be no assurance that E.ON will be able to achieve the returns expected from any acquisition or investment. It is also possible that E.ON will not be able to realize its strategic ambition of enlarging its investment pipeline and that significant amounts of capital could be used for other opportunities. The overall risk position in this category was moderate at the balance-sheet date; the chance position was low.\n\nFurthermore, acquisitions and investments in new geographic areas or lines of business require E.ON to become familiar with new sales markets and competitors and to address the attending business risks.\n\nIn the case of planned disposals, E.ON faces the risk of disposals not taking place or being delayed and the risk that E.ON receives lower-than-anticipated disposal proceeds. In addition, after transactions close E.ON could face major liability risks resulting from contractual obligations (tail/major).\n\n## Finance and Treasury Risks\n\nE.ON is exposed to credit risk in its operating activities and through the use of financial instruments. Credit risk results from nondelivery or partial delivery by a counterparty or customer of the agreed consideration for services rendered, from total or partial failure to make payments owed on existing accounts receivable, and from replacement risks in open transactions.\n\nE.ON's international business operations are exposed to risks from currency fluctuation. One form of this risk is transaction risk, which arises when payments are made in a currency other than E.ON's functional currency. Another form of risk is translation risk, which arises when currency fluctuations lead to accounting effects when assets/liabilities and income/expenses of E.ON companies outside the eurozone are translated into euros and entered into E.ON's Consolidated Financial Statements. Positive developments in foreign-currency rates can also create chances for E.ON's operating business.\n\nE.ON faces earnings risks relating to net income from financial liabilities, planned funding, and interest-rate derivatives that are based on variable interest rates and from non-current assetretirement obligations.\n\nDerivative transactions may result in short-term cash inflows or outflows. This relates in particular to margin payments for electricity and gas procurement transactions on energy exchanges. The additional liquidity requirements potentially resulting from this are factored into E.ON's financing strategy.\n\nIn addition, the price changes and other uncertainty relating to the current and non-current investments E.ON makes to cover its non-\n\ncurrent obligations (particularly pension and asset-retirement obligations) could, in individual cases, be major.\n\nIn principle, E.ON could also encounter tax risks and chances.\n\nThis category has a medium risk and a medium chance position.\n\nFurthermore, declining or rising discount rates could lead to increased or reduced provisions for pensions and asset-retirement obligations, including non-current liabilities (tail, major). This can create a high balance-sheet risk for E.ON.\n\nRefinancing terms on debt capital markets depend in part on rating agencies' credit ratings. Rating agencies Moody's, S&P, and Fitch have given E.ON a strong investment-grade rating. E.ON has contracts that would trigger additional collateral requirements if certain rating levels were not met. Consequently, significant rating downgrades could lead to additional liquidity requirements (tail/high). On the other hand, positive business performance or further debt reduction could have a positive impact on E.ON's rating.\n\n## ESG Risks and Chances\n\n\u25ba E.ON strives to operate responsibly at all times and therefore monitors all the material impacts of its business activities. Alongside financial aspects, E.ON also considers environmental, social, and governance ('ESG') aspects along its value chain. This encompasses monitoring and assessing ESG risks and chances as well as their possible impact on the E.ON Group, but also the impact of E.ON's business activities on the climate, the environment, employees, suppliers, and customers. The systematic consideration of non-financial issues enables the Company to identify opportunities and risks for business development at an early stage.\n\nE.ON has integrated the reporting of non-financial risks related to ESG and their impact on the Group into the ERM. All risks and chances related to ESG are made identifiable in the ERM system.",

Sustainability risks can have a considerable impact on all of these known risk categories and can be a factor in contributing to their materiality.\n\nIn addition, E.ON analyzes potential reportable risks within the meaning of Section 289c, Paragraph 3, Sentence 1, Items 3 and 4 of the German Commercial Code (German abbreviation: 'HGB'), while taking into account its ESG materiality analysis, management approaches, and the ERM's findings. This involves considering risks relating to environmental, employee, and social matters as well as human rights, anticorruption, and antibribery. At year-end 2023, E.ON had not identified any major risks related to its own business activities and business relationships as well as products and services pursuant to Section 289c, Paragraph 3, Sentence 1, Items 3 and 4 of the HGB that are very likely to have or will have serious negative impacts on ESG aspects.\n\nE.ON places an emphasis on analyzing its climate risks, in part because of E.ON's support of the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures ('TCFD'). Safeguarding its assets against climate-change impacts and the climate resilience of its business model are economically relevant to E.ON. Our analysis therefore includes both physical risks (direct impacts of climate change, such as extreme weather and rising temperatures) and transitory risks resulting from the transition to a low-carbon and more climate-resilient economy (such as changes in consumer preferences, the regulatory environment, and carbon pricing).\n\nPhysical climate risks are also the focus of the EU Taxonomy Regulation's do-no-significant-harm ('DNSH') provisions (see the 'EU Taxonomy' chapter). They are assigned to the EU environmental objective 2 'climate change adaptation.' E.ON assesses DNSH compliance with climate change adaptation at the Group level. Each E.ON Group business unit is required to comprehensively assess and record climate risks as part of its risk reporting. Any risks that significantly jeopardize climate change\n\nadaptation are identified in the risk management process. This basic approach to identifying any potential harm to climate change adaptation is verified in consultation with relevant specialist departments.\n\nIn addition, in 2021 E.ON for the first time developed a qualitative scenario analysis describing the impact of three different climate scenarios on E.ON and on individual E.ON business units through 2050. This involved defining three reference scenarios (conservative, ambitious, and fully committed) and assessing and identifying the relevant business units on the basis of key value drivers and related key performance indicators ('KPIs'). The next step was to develop a qualitative scenario impact analysis by analyzing the key value drivers identified by the business units and by performing a risk assessment as well as by evaluating the business impacts. The last step was to develop strategic recommendations.\n\nThis scenario analysis was enlarged in 2022 and applied to the climate risks defined in the EU taxonomy. First, E.ON's main EU taxonomy-aligned economic activities and its companies making the main contribution to the corresponding investments were identified centrally. Next, these companies used a bottom-up process to determine the climate risks for the relevant economic activities or investments in accordance with the EU taxonomy catalog. These risks were then subjected to a scenario analysis. A qualitative risk assessment was performed for each identified climate risk and economic activity in line with the IPCC scenarios SSP1-2.6 and SSP5-8.5 for the reference period 2041 to 2060. We conducted an update of the scenario analysis for the 2023 financial year. The findings of this risk assessment do not differ in nature from the risks already reported and managed in the ERM. As for the amount of damage estimated in the scenario analysis, in 2023 there were again no significant deviations from the century events for weather or climate risks already reported in the ERM. \u25c4\n\n## Management Board's Evaluation of the Risk and Chances Situation\n\nThe E.ON Group's overall risk and chances situation at year-end 2023 changed significantly relative to year-end 2022, in particular because of lower commodity prices. Although the maximum annual risk for the E.ON Group's adjusted EBITDA over the period under consideration remains classified as major and despite the major counterparty risks and risks resulting from lawsuits and legal proceeding relating to contract and price adjustments at Customer Solutions, from today's perspective E.ON does not perceive any risk profile that could threaten the existence of E.ON SE, the E.ON Group, or individual segments.",

Energy Networks (Germany, Sweden, and East-Central Europe/Turkey), Customer Solutions (Germany, United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Other), and Corporate Functions/Other are the Company's IFRS reportable segments.\n\nE.ON SE prepares its Financial Statements in accordance with the German Commercial Code, the SE Ordinance (in conjunction with the German Stock Corporation Act), and the German Energy Act.\n\nE.ON prepares a Combined Group Management Report which applies to both the E.ON Group and E.ON SE.\n\n## Accounting Process\n\nAll companies included in the Consolidated Financial Statements must comply with E.ON's uniform Accounting and Reporting Guidelines for the Annual Consolidated Financial Statements and the Interim Consolidated Financial Statements. These guidelines describe applicable IFRS accounting and valuation principles. They also explain accounting principles typical in the E.ON Group, such as those for provisions for nuclear-waste management, the treatment of financial instruments, and the treatment of\n\nregulatory obligations. E.ON regularly analyzes amendments to laws, new or amended accounting standards, and other important pronouncements for their relevance to, and consequences for, the Consolidated Financial Statements and, if necessary, update its guidelines and systems accordingly.\n\nCorporate Functions defines and oversees the roles and responsibilities of various Group entities in the preparation of E.ON SE's Financial Statements and the Consolidated Financial Statements. These roles and responsibilities are described in a Group Policy document.\n\nE.ON Group companies are responsible for preparing their financial statements in a proper and timely manner. They receive substantial support from Business Service Centers in Regensburg, Germany; Cluj, Romania; and Krak\u00f3w, Poland. E.ON SE combines the financial statements of subsidiaries belonging to its scope of consolidation into its Consolidated Financial Statements using standard consolidation software. Group Accounting is responsible for conducting the consolidation and for monitoring adherence to the guidelines for scheduling, processes, and contents. Monitoring by means of system-based automated controls is supplemented by manual checks.\n\nIn conjunction with the year-end closing process, additional qualitative and quantitative information relevant for accounting is compiled. Furthermore, dedicated quality-control processes are in place for all relevant departments to discuss and ensure the completeness of important information on a regular basis.\n\nE.ON SE's Financial Statements are prepared with SAP software. The accounting and preparation processes are divided into discrete functional steps. Bookkeeping processes have largely been outsourced to E.ON's Business Service Centers. Cluj has the primary responsibility for processes relating to subsidiary ledgers and several bank activities. Regensburg has the principal responsibility for processes relating to the general ledgers. Automated or manual controls are integrated into each step.\n\nDefined procedures ensure that all transactions and the preparation of E.ON SE's Financial Statements are recorded, processed, assigned on an accrual basis, and documented in a complete, timely, and accurate manner. Relevant data from E.ON SE's Financial Statements are, if necessary, adjusted to conform with IFRS and then transferred to the consolidation software system using SAP-supported transfer technology.\n\nThe following explanations about E.ON's internal control system ('ICS') and its general IT controls apply equally to the Consolidated Financial Statements and to E.ON SE's Financial Statements.\n\n## Internal Control System\n\nThe purpose of the ICS framework and the annual ICS process is to provide sufficient assurance to prevent error or fraud from resulting in material misrepresentations in the Financial Statements, the Combined Group Management Report, the HalfYear Financial Report, the Quarterly Statements, as well as ESG reporting. Furthermore, it serves to assure compliance to significant internal and external regulations and to assure effectiveness and efficiency of business activities. The management of each unit in the E.ON Group is legally responsible for establishing and maintaining an adequate and effective internal control system ('ICS'). The Compliance function is responsible for the implementation of the compliance management system ('CMS') which is described in the Corporate Governance Declaration. The Corporate Governance Declaration can be found on the E.ON website www.eon.com in the Corporate Governance section under \"Corporate Governance Declaration.\" The ICS department at Corporate Audit is responsible for the oversight and coordination of the overall ICS process in order to ensure an effective ICS in the E.ON Group. For this purpose, the ICS department at Corporate Audit provides the ICS framework and the necessary tools. An ICS Business Partner ('ICS BP') is assigned to each unit that is of importance to the E.ON Group and therefore in the ICS documentation scope. The ICS BP is responsible for coordinating and monitoring the unit's ICS activities and advises",

The unit's management remains responsible for the appropriateness and effectiveness of the implemented ICS. The ICS BP system ensures a uniform approach as well as consistent and efficient collaboration and fosters continuous improvement by means of extensive information-sharing among Group companies.\n\n## E.ON's ICS Framework\n\nE.ON's ICS is based on the globally recognized COSO framework from May 2013 (COSO: The Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission).\n\nThe catalog of ICS Principles, which defines the minimum requirements for an effective internal control system, is a key component of E.ON's ICS. It contains overarching principles such as authorization, segregation of duties, and master data management as well as specific requirements for managing potential risks in various areas and processes, such as supplier monitoring, project management, invoice verification, payments, and ESG reporting. All fully consolidated companies and majorityowned units are subject to the ICS Principles.\n\nIn addition to the ICS Principles, certain units of special importance to the E.ON Group's Consolidated Financial Statements must fulfill several additional ICS requirements for selected processes. These requirements relate to the documentation and assessment of the relevant processes and controls-the ICS model-as well as reporting to Corporate Audit. The ICS model, which incorporates company- and industry-specific aspects, defines potential risks for accounting (financial reporting), for ESG reporting (non-financial reporting), for compliance with important internal and external rules, and for the operating units of their operating targets, and serves as a checklist, and provides guidance for the establishment of internal controls as well as their documentation and implementation.\n\nA functionally managed digital organization and third-party service providers provide IT and digital services for the E.ON Group. IT systems used for accounting as well as IT systems relevant for the ESG-Reporting are subject to the internal control system framework, which includes IT general controls, such as access controls, segregation of duties, processing controls, measures to prevent the intentional and unintentional falsification of the programs, data, and documents as well as controls related to supplier monitoring. The documentation of the IT general controls is stored in E.ON's documentation system.\n\nEach year, qualitative criteria and quantitative materiality aspects are used to determine which processes and controls must be documented and assessed by which E.ON units.\n\nE.ON units in the ICS documentation scope use a central documentation system (SAP-GRC) for this purpose. The system contains the scope, detailed documentation requirements, the assessment requirements for process owners, and the final SignOff process.\n\n## Management Self-Assessment and Control Tests\n\nAfter E.ON units have documented their processes and controls, the individual process owners conduct an annual assessment of the design and the operational effectiveness of the controls embedded in these processes and the ICS principles. This is known as a management self-assessment. The assessment is supported by tests of control effectiveness for selective risk areas. Corporate Audit's ICS department defines the methodology for these tests, which are conducted by the process owners or employees assigned by them.\n\nIn addition, the effectiveness of the internal controls is audited by Internal Audit. These audits are conducted based on a risk-oriented audit plan. Any identified deficiencies are reported to the relevant companies.\n\nFurthermore, the E.ON Group's general IT controls that are relevant for the Consolidated Balance Sheets, selected controls of the Business Service Centers in Regensburg and Cluj, selected controls of the Human Resources Service Center in Germany (E.ON Country Hub Germany GmbH), and selected controls of the Pension Service Company in Germany (Energie PensionsManagement GmbH) were audited as part of the audit of the Group's Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nThe findings of the management self-assessments and the audits are included in the integrated annual report on the effectiveness of the entire E.ON Group's ICS and are reported to the E.ON SE Management Board.\n\n## Sign-Off Process\n\nBased on the self-assessment result and internal and external audit findings, the respective management of the unit conducts the final Sign-Off. The final step of the internal evaluation process is the submission of a formal written declaration confirming the ICS's effectiveness ('Sign-Off'). The Sign-Off process is conducted at all levels of the Group companies before E.ON SE, as the final step, conducts it for the Group as a whole. The Chairman of the E.ON SE Management Board and the Chief Financial Officer perform the final Sign-Off for the E.ON Group.\n\nCorporate Audit regularly informs the E.ON SE Supervisory Board's Audit & Risk Committee about the ICS for financial reporting and about any significant deficiencies identified in the E.ON Group's various processes.\n\n## Statement on the E.ON Group's Internal Control System and Risk Management System in the Narrower Sense (Enterprise Risk Management)\n\n\u203a The entire E.ON SE Management Board affirms that it is aware of its responsibility to establish and maintain an appropriate and effective internal control system ('ICS') and enterprise risk management ('ERM') system for the E.ON Group.

Each share of stock grants the same rights and one vote at a Shareholders Meeting.\n\n## Restrictions on Voting Rights or the Transfer of Shares\n\nAn employee stock-purchase program was offered in 2021 and 2022. Shares acquired by employees under the employee stockpurchase program are subject to a blackout period that begins the day ownership of such shares is transferred to the employee and that ends on December 31 of the next calendar year plus one. As a rule, an employee may not sell such shares until the blackout period has expired.\n\nPursuant to Section 71b of the German Stock Corporation Act (German abbreviation: 'AktG'), the Company's treasury shares give it no rights, including no voting rights.\n\n## Legal Provisions and Rules of the Company's Articles of Association Regarding the Appointment and Dismissal of Management Board Members and Amendments to the Articles of Association\n\nPursuant to the Company's Articles of Association, the Management Board consists of at least two members. The Supervisory Board decides on the number of members as well as on their appointment and dismissal.\n\nThe Supervisory Board appoints members to the Management Board for a term not exceeding five years; reappointment is\n\npermissible. If several persons are appointed as members of the Management Board, the Supervisory Board may appoint one of the members as Chairperson of the Management Board. If there is a vacancy on the Management Board for a required member, the court makes the necessary appointment upon petition by a concerned party in the event of an urgent matter. The Supervisory Board may revoke the appointment of a member of the Management Board and of the Chairperson of the Management Board for serious cause (for further details, see Sections 84 and 85 of the AktG).\n\nResolutions of the Shareholders Meeting require a majority of the valid votes cast unless mandatory law or the Articles of Association explicitly prescribe otherwise. An amendment to the Articles of Association requires a two-thirds majority of the votes cast or, in cases where at least half of the share capital is represented, a simple majority of the votes cast unless mandatory law explicitly prescribes another type of majority.\n\nThe Supervisory Board is authorized to decide by resolution on amendments to the Articles of Association that affect only their wording (Section 10, Paragraph 7, of the Articles of Association).\n\nFurthermore, the Supervisory Board is authorized to revise the wording of Section 3 of the Articles of Association upon utilization of authorized or conditional capital.\n\n## Management Board's Power to Issue or Buy Back Shares\n\nPursuant to a resolution of the Shareholders Meeting of May 28, 2020, the Management Board is authorized, until May 27, 2025, to have the Company acquire treasury shares. The shares acquired and other treasury shares that are in possession of or to be attributed to the Company pursuant to Sections 71a et seq. of the AktG must altogether at no point account for more than 10 percent of the Company's share capital.\n\nAt the Management Board's discretion, the acquisition may be conducted:\n\n- \u00b7 through a stock exchange\n- \u00b7 by means of a public offer directed at all shareholders or a public solicitation to submit offers\n- \u00b7 by means of a public offer or a public solicitation to submit offers for the exchange of liquid shares that are admitted to trading on an organized market, within the meaning of the German Securities Purchase and Takeover Law, for Company shares\n- \u00b7 by the use of derivatives (put or call options or a combination of both).\n\nThese authorizations may be utilized on one or several occasions, in whole or in partial amounts, in pursuit of one or more objectives by the Company and also by its affiliated companies or by third parties for the Company's account or one of its affiliates' account.\n\nWith regard to treasury shares that will be, or have been, acquired based on the aforementioned authorization and/or prior authorizations by the Shareholders Meeting, the Management Board is authorized, subject to the Supervisory Board's consent and excluding shareholder subscription rights, to use these shares-in addition to a disposal through a stock exchange or an offer granting a subscription right to all shareholders-as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 to be sold and transferred against cash consideration\n- \u00b7 to be sold and transferred against contributions in kind\n- \u00b7 to be used in order to satisfy the rights of creditors of bonds with conversion or option rights or, respectively, conversion obligations issued by the Company or its Group companies",

Subject to the Supervisory Board's approval, the Management Board is authorized to exclude shareholders' subscription rights.\n\nAt the Annual Shareholders Meeting of May 28, 2020, shareholders approved a conditional increase of the Company's share capital (with the option to exclude shareholders' subscription rights) up to the amount of \u20ac264 million ('Conditional Capital 2020'). Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements contains more information about Conditional Capital 2020.\n\n## Significant Agreements to Which the Company Is a Party That Take Effect on a Change of Control of the Company Following a Takeover Bid\n\nThe underlying contracts of debt issued since 2007 contain change-of-control clauses that give the creditor the right of cancellation. This applies, inter alia, to bonds issued by E.ON SE and E.ON International Finance B.V. and guaranteed by E.ON SE and other instruments such as credit contracts. Granting changeof-control rights to creditors is considered good corporate governance and has become standard market practice. More information about financial liabilities is contained in the section of the Combined Group Management Report entitled Financial Situation and in Note 27 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Settlement Agreements between the Company and Management Board Members or Employees in the Case of a Change-of-Control Event\n\nIn the event of a premature loss of a Management Board position due to a change-of-control event, the service agreements of Management Board members entitle them to severance and settlement payments. The entitlement exists if, within 12 months of the change of control, a Management Board member's service agreement is terminated by mutual consent, expires, or is terminated by the Management Board member; in the latter case, however, only if the member's Management Board position is materially affected by the change of control. Management Board members' severance payment consists of their base salary and target bonus plus fringe benefits for two years after termination of their service agreement. In accordance with the DCGK, these\n\nseverance payments are limited to the amount of the annual compensation for the remaining term of the service agreement. Total compensation for the past financial year and the expected total compensation for the current financial year in which the service agreement ends prematurely are used to calculate the severance payment cap.\n\nThe purpose of these contractual agreements is to preserve the independence of Management Board members.\n\nA change-of-control event would also result in the early payout of virtual shares under the E.ON Performance Plan.\n\n## Other Disclosures Regarding Takeovers\n\nThe Company has been notified about the following direct or indirect interests in its share capital that exceed 10 percent of the voting rights:\n\n- \u00b7 notification on December 10, 2020, by RWE Aktiengesellschaft for 15 percent of the voting rights.\n\nStock with special rights granting power of control has not been issued. In the case of stock given by the Company to employees, employees exercise their rights of control directly and in accordance with legal provisions and the provisions of the Articles of Association, just like other shareholders.",

On March 4, 2024, the Board of Management of E.ON SE approved the Consolidated Financial Statements as of December 31, 2023, for publication.\n\n## Principles\n\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements of the E.ON Group ('E.ON' or the 'Group') are generally prepared at cost, with the exception of financial assets that are measured at fair value through OCI (FVOCI), financial assets that are measured at fair value through profit or loss (FVPL) and financial liabilities that are measured at fair value through profit or loss (FVPL).\n\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements were prepared in euros. Unless otherwise stated, all amounts are shown in millions of euros (\u20ac million). For accounting reasons, rounding differences may occur. These financial statements relate to the financial year from January 1 to December 31, 2023. In accordance with IAS 1, 'Presentation of Financial Statements' ('IAS 1'), the Consolidated Balance Sheets have been prepared using a classified balance sheet structure. Assets that will be realized within 12 months of the reporting date, as well as liabilities that are due to be settled within one year of the reporting date are generally classified as current. The Consolidated Statement of Income is classified using\n\nthe nature of expense method, which is also applied for internal purposes.\n\n## Scope of Consolidation\n\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements incorporate the financial statements of E.ON SE and entities controlled by E.ON ('subsidiaries'). Control exists when the Group is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to use its power over the investee to influence those returns. Control is generally deemed established when a majority of the voting rights is held. An entity is a structured entity if control is based on contractual arrangements or other legal relationships and is not reflected in a majority of voting rights.\n\nThe results of the subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the Consolidated Statement of Income from the date of acquisition or until the date of their disposal, respectively.\n\nIf the issue of shares in subsidiaries or associates to third parties leads to a reduction in E.ON's ownership interest in these investees ('dilution'), and consequently to a loss of control, joint control or significant influence, gains and losses from these dilutive transactions are included in the income statement under other operating income or expenses.\n\nWhere necessary, adjustments are made to the subsidiaries' financial statements to bring their accounting policies into line with those of the Group. Intercompany receivables, liabilities and results are eliminated in the consolidation process.\n\n## Associated Companies\n\nAn associate is an investee over whose financial and operating policy decisions E.ON has significant influence and that is not controlled by E.ON or jointly controlled with E.ON. Significant influence is presumed if E.ON directly or indirectly holds at least 20 percent, but not more than 50 percent, of an entity's voting\n\nrights. Interests in associated companies are accounted for using the equity method.\n\nInterests in associated companies accounted for using the equity method are reported on the balance sheet at cost, adjusted for changes in the Group's share of the net assets after the date of acquisition and for any impairment charges. Losses that might potentially exceed the Group's interest in an associated company when attributable long-term loans are taken into consideration are generally not recognized. Any difference between the cost of the investment and the pro rata remeasured value of its net assets is recognized in the Consolidated Financial Statements as part of the carrying amount.\n\nCompanies accounted for using the equity method are tested for impairment by comparing the carrying amount with its recoverable amount. If the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount, the carrying amount is adjusted for this difference. If the reasons for previously recognized impairment losses no longer exist, such impairment losses are reversed accordingly.\n\n## Joint Ventures\n\nJoint ventures are also accounted for using the equity method. Unrealized gains and losses arising from transactions with jointventure companies are eliminated within the consolidation process on a pro rata basis if they are material.\n\n## Joint Operations\n\nA joint operation exists when E.ON and other investors directly control an operation, but unlike a joint venture, they do not have a claim to the changes in net assets from the operation. Instead, they have direct rights to individual assets or direct obligations with respect to individual liabilities in connection with the operation. E.ON recognizes assets and liabilities as well as revenues and expenses in a joint operation pro rata according to the rights and obligations attributable to E.ON.",

The fair values are determined using published exchange or market prices at the time of acquisition in the case of marketable securities or commodities, for example, and in the case of land, buildings and major technical equipment, generally using independent expert reports that have been prepared by third parties. If exchange or market prices are unavailable for consideration, fair values are derived from market prices for comparable assets or comparable transactions. If these values are not directly observable, fair value is determined using appropriate valuation methods. In such cases, E.ON determines fair value using the discounted cash flow method by discounting estimated future cash flows by a weighted-average cost of capital.\n\nNon-controlling interests can be measured either at cost (partial goodwill method) or at fair value (full goodwill method). The choice of method can be made on a case-by-case basis. The partial goodwill method is generally used within the E.ON Group.\n\nIntangible assets must be recognized separately if they are clearly separable or if their recognition arises from a contractual or other legal right. Provisions for restructuring measures may not be recorded in a purchase price allocation. If the purchase price paid exceeds the proportional share in the revalued net assets at the time of acquisition, the positive difference is recognized as goodwill. No goodwill is recognized for positive differences attributable to non-controlling interests. A negative difference is recognized in net income.\n\n## Foreign Currency Translation\n\nThe Company's transactions denominated in foreign currency are translated at the current exchange rate at the date of the transaction. At each balance sheet date monetary foreign currency items are adjusted to the exchange rate on the reporting date; any gains and losses resulting from fluctuations in the relevant\n\ncurrencies are recognized in net income and reported as other operating income and other operating expenses, respectively. Gains and losses from the translation of non-derivative financial instruments used in hedges of net investments in foreign operations are recognized in equity as a component of other comprehensive income. The ineffective portion of the hedging instrument is immediately recognized in net income.\n\nThe functional currency as well as the reporting currency of E.ON SE is the euro.

As a result, among other things, non-monetary assets and liabilities are generally adjusted using a general price index and a gain or loss on the net monetary position is recognized. For additional information on the application of IAS 29 in fiscal year 2023, please refer to Note 16.\n\n## Recognition of Income\n\n## a) Revenues\n\nRevenues in the 'Customer Solutions' segment are generated primarily from the sale of electricity and gas to retail customers, industrial and commercial customers and wholesale markets as well as from district heating and cooling. For contracts that do not provide for defined purchase quantities, the performance obligation consists in particular in the provision and availability of energy on demand at any time (standing ready obligation). The distribution of products and services used to increase energy efficiency and energy autonomy are also part of the 'Customer Solutions' business. This primarily includes the energy infrastructure segments (here the performance obligations are primarily the installation of block-type thermal power stations and photovoltaic power stations, air-conditioning systems and heat pumps, wall insulation and window replacement), Future Energy Home (energy efficiency services, modernization of interior lighting, transformer maintenance, heating solutions, energy consulting services) and eMobility (eFleet service, installation and service of eChargers).\n\nIn the Energy Networks business, mainly earnings from the distribution of electricity and gas are included in revenues. E.ON makes the electricity and gas distribution network available to its customers. Significant parts of the fees generated from this distribution are regulated and are therefore subject to efficiencybased upper limits on revenue. Since the introduction of IFRS 15 with effect from January 1, 2018, revenues no longer include the",

An asset is deemed to be transferred when the customer obtains control of the asset. The majority of the E.ON Group's revenues are recognized over time because customers use these services when they are provided. For all such revenues, progress is measured using output-based methods, e.g., through the measurement of services that have already been provided or units that have been produced or delivered. For construction contracts, the stage of completion for overtime revenue recognition can be determined using input-based methods, such as the cost-to-cost method. The methods used appropriately reflect the pattern of transfer of goods to customers or provision of services for customers. The relatively subordinate point-in-time revenue recognition occurs primarily in the 'Build & Sell' area on the installation of solar panels or charging stations and for socalled linear products, where a fixed amount of energy is provided to commercial customers at a specific point in time. Revenue is recognized when control is transferred to the customer, which means that no significant discretionary decisions are required.\n\nRevenues from the sale of goods and services are measured using the transaction prices allocated to these goods and services. They reflect the value of the volume supplied, including an estimated value of the volume supplied to customers between the date of the last invoice and the end of the period. Monthly advance payments for B2C customers are generally determined on the basis of historical consumption data, taking into account current temperature effects. Peak payments are settled at the end of the settlement period. In B2B, a bottom-up approach is used to calculate individual rates. Contractually agreed variable consideration may be allocated to an entire contract or to specific components of a contract, which is the case with energy supply agreements with a base fee, for which the variable consideration is allocated in full to the actual supply of energy, but not to the\n\nfundamental willingness to supply the energy. E.ON's sales transactions generally are not based on any material finance components. The average target payment period is generally between 10 and 30 days, in exceptional cases longer. Refunds to customers are an exception and are granted if the customer is disconnected from the power supply for an extended period of time. Cash bonuses or bonus payments to customers are recognized as refund liabilities and presented as a decrease in revenues uniformly over the term of the contract. As a rule, no warranties are granted in the Core Business. Warranties are only granted in the 'Build & Sell' activities.\n\n## b) Interest Income\n\nInterest income is recognized pro rata using the effective interest method.\n\n## c) Dividend Income\n\nDividend income is recognized when the right to receive the distribution payment arises.\n\n## Electricity and Energy Taxes\n\nElectricity and energy taxes are levied on electricity and natural gas delivered to retail customers and are calculated on the basis of a fixed tax rate per kilowatt-hour ('kWh'). This rate varies between different classes of customers. Electricity and energy taxes payable are deducted from sales revenues on the face of the income statement if those taxes are levied upon delivery of energy to the retail customer.\n\n## Earnings per Share\n\nBasic (undiluted) earnings per share is computed by dividing the consolidated net income attributable to the shareholders of the parent company by the weighted-average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the relevant period. At E.ON, the computation of diluted earnings per share is identical to that of basic earnings per share because E.ON SE has issued no potentially dilutive ordinary shares. The increase in the weighted-average number of shares outstanding resulted primarily from the issue of\n\ntreasury shares in E.ON SE under the voluntary employee stock purchase program.\n\n## Goodwill and Intangible Assets\n\n## Goodwill\n\nGoodwill is not amortized, but rather tested for impairment at the cash-generating unit level on at least an annual basis. The term cash-generating unit also always includes groups of cashgenerating units and is referred to in simplified form as a cashgenerating unit. Goodwill must also be tested for impairment, during the year, at the level of individual cash-generating units if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the recoverable amount of a particular cash-generating unit might be impaired, resulting in a shortfall in the carrying amount.\n\nNewly created goodwill is allocated to those cash-generating units expected to benefit from the respective business combination. The cash-generating units to which goodwill is allocated are generally equivalent to the operating segments, since goodwill is reported, and considered in performance metrics for controlling, only at that level. If goodwill cannot be allocated arbitrarily to individual cashgenerating units but instead can only be allocated to groups of cash-generating units, the lowest level within the unit at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes then includes several cash-generating units to which the goodwill relates but to which it cannot be allocated individually. Goodwill impairment testing is performed in euros, while the underlying goodwill is always carried in the functional currency.\n\nIn a first step, E.ON determines the recoverable amount of a cashgenerating unit on the basis of the fair value (less costs to sell) using generally accepted valuation procedures. This is based on the medium-term planning data of the respective cash-generating unit. Valuation is performed using the discounted cash flow method unless market transactions or valuations prepared by third parties for comparable assets which are higher-level in the fair",

If needed, a calculation of value in use is also performed.\n\nIf the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount, the goodwill allocated to that cash-generating unit is adjusted in the amount of this difference.\n\nE.ON performs the annual testing of goodwill for impairment at the cash-generating unit level in the fourth quarter on October 1 of each fiscal year.\n\nImpairment charges on the goodwill of a cash-generating unit and reported in the income statement under 'Depreciation, amortization and impairment charges' may not be reversed in subsequent reporting periods.\n\n## Intangible Assets\n\nIAS 38, 'Intangible Assets' ('IAS 38'), requires that intangible assets be amortized over their expected useful lives unless their lives are considered to be indefinite. Factors such as typical product life cycles and legal or similar limits on use are taken into account in the classification.\n\nInternally generated intangible assets subject to amortization are related to software and are recognized as development costs. Intangible assets subject to amortization are generally amortized using the straight-line method over their expected useful lives. The useful lives of customer relationships and similar assets range between 2 and 50 years, and between 3 and 50 years for concessions, industrial property rights, licenses and similar rights, unless depreciation based on consumption reflects an appropriate level of depletion. This latter category includes software in particular. Useful lives and amortization methods are subject to regular verification. Intangible assets subject to amortization are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that such assets may be impaired.\n\nIntangible assets whose use has not yet started are not amortized. An impairment test is carried out at least once a year as well as whenever there are indications of impairment, either for the individual asset or at the level of the cash-generating unit. The useful life of an intangible asset with an indefinite life is tested annually to determine whether the indefinite life assumption continues to be justified.\n\nBoth assets with definite and indefinite useful lives are impaired if the recoverable amount -the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use -is lower than the carrying amount. If the reasons for the impairment losses previously recognized under depreciation, amortization and impairment charges no longer apply, these assets are written up to a maximum of the value that would have resulted if no impairment losses had been recognized during the preceding periods, taking into account scheduled depreciation.\n\nSee Note 15 for additional information about goodwill and intangible assets.\n\n## Research and Development Costs\n\nUnder IFRS, expenditure on research is expensed as incurred, while costs incurred during the development phase of new products, services and technologies are to be recognized as assets when the specific criteria for recognition specified in IAS 38 are present. In the 2022 and 2023 fiscal years, E.ON capitalized costs for internally generated software and other technologies in this context.\n\n## Property, Plant and Equipment\n\nProperty, plant and equipment are initially measured at acquisition or production cost, including decommissioning or restoration cost that must be capitalized, and are depreciated over the expected useful lives of the components, generally using the straight-line method, unless a different method of depreciation is deemed more suitable in certain exceptional cases. Useful lives are regularly tested for appropriateness and the underlying assumptions and\n\nestimates are updated, for example, in view of technical, economic or legal circumstances.\n\nThe useful lives of the most significant asset classes of material property, plant and equipment are presented below:\n\n## Useful Lives of Property, Plant and Equipment\n\n| Buildings                                                 | 5 to 60 years   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|\n| Technical equipment, plant and machinery                  | 2 to 80 years   |\n| Other equipment, fixtures, furniture and office equipment | 2 to 30 years   |\n\nProperty, plant and equipment are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset may be impaired. In such a case, property, plant and equipment are tested for impairment according to the principles prescribed for intangible assets in IAS 36. If the reasons for the impairment losses previously recognized under depreciation, amortization and impairment charges no longer exist, such impairment losses are reversed and recognized in income. Such reversal shall not cause the carrying amount to exceed the amount that would have resulted had no impairment taken place during the preceding periods.\n\nSubsequent costs arising, for example, from additional or replacement capital expenditure are only recognized as part of the acquisition or production cost of the asset, or else-if relevantrecognized as a separate asset if it is probable that the Group will receive a future economic benefit and the cost can be determined reliably.\n\nRepair and maintenance costs that do not constitute significant replacement capital expenditure are expensed as incurred.\n\n## Borrowing Costs\n\nBorrowing costs that arise in connection with the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset from the time of acquisition or from the beginning of construction or production",

In the case of a specific financing arrangement, the respective borrowing costs incurred for that particular arrangement during the period are used. For non-specific financing arrangements, a financing rate uniform within the Group of 2.66 percent was applied for 2023 (2022: 2.59 percent). Other borrowing costs are expensed.\n\n## Government Grants\n\nThe Group receives grants for assets and grants related to income.\n\nGovernment investment subsidies do not reduce the acquisition and production costs of the respective assets; they are instead reported on the balance sheet as deferred income. They are recognized in income on a straight-line basis over the associated asset's expected useful life.\n\nGrants related to income are also generally recognized as deferred income on the balance sheet. The liability item is reversed over the period necessary to match the corresponding income effects that are intended to compensate for the government grants. Grants are recognized in the same way as subsidized items.\n\nGovernment grants are recognized at fair value if the Group satisfies the necessary conditions for receipt of the grant and if it is highly probable that the grant will be issued.\n\n## Leasing\n\nLease agreements are accounted for in accordance with IFRS 16, 'Leases' ('IFRS 16'). A lease is an agreement that conveys the right to use an identified asset for a specified period in exchange for consideration. In certain cases, agreements that are not concluded in the form of a rental or lease agreement (e.g., physical power purchase agreements) are also reviewed to determine whether they contain a lease in accordance with IFRS 16. E.ON is party to some agreements in which it is the lessor and to others in which it is the lessee.\n\n## E.ON as Lessee\n\nTransactions in which E.ON acts as a lessee are accounted for on the basis of the right-of-use model. The recognition exemption of IFRS 16.5 is used for low-value leases and for agreements with a lease term of less than 12 months (short-term leases). Accordingly, there is no recognition of the right-of-use asset and the lease liability. Instead, the payments are recognized on a straight-line basis as an expense. In line with internal management practice, intragroup leases are recognized as current expenses in the segment reporting.\n\nA lease liability is recognized in the amount of the present value of the existing payment obligation. Where an arrangement provides for payments for lease components and non-lease components, the payments are not separated using the practical expedient under IFRS 16.15 (with the exception of real estate leases); the lease liability is measured taking into account the total amount of the payments. Present value is determined by discounting with an incremental borrowing rate that is equivalent in terms of risk and term if the implicit interest rate cannot be determined. The liability is subsequently measured using the effective interest method. A right-of-use asset corresponding with the lease liability is recognized in the amount of the present value of the lease payments. The initial recognition amount of the right-of-use asset is increased by the amount of the initial direct costs, as well as expected costs for asset retirement obligations; prepayments made are included and lease incentives received are deducted from the initial recognition amount. A right-of-use asset is subsequently measured at amortized cost. Depreciation is carried out on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease term or the useful life of the identified asset. An impairment test is carried out in accordance with IAS 36 if events or changed circumstances indicate an impairment.\n\nE.ON ensures its operational flexibility when concluding leasing agreements through the use of extension and termination options. In determining the lease term, E.ON considers all facts and circumstances that provide an economic incentive to exercise\n\nexisting options. The lease term therefore also includes periods covered by extension options if it is assumed with reasonable certainty that they will be exercised.\n\n## E.ON as Lessor\n\nLease transactions in which E.ON acts as lessor are classified as operating or finance leases depending on the distribution of risks and rewards. If a lease is classified as an operating lease, E.ON recognizes the identified asset and recognizes the lease payments as other operating income on a straight-line basis over the lease term. For finance leases, the identified asset is derecognized and a receivable is recognized in the amount of the net investment value. Payments made by the lessee are treated as a reduction of the lease receivable or interest income. The income from such arrangements is recognized over the term of the lease using the effective interest method. Subleases are classified based on the right-of-use asset under the head lease.\n\n## Financial Instruments\n\n## Non-Derivative Financial Instruments\n\nNon-derivative financial instruments are measured in accordance with IFRS 9, 'Financial Instruments' ('IFRS 9'). They are recognized at fair value, including transaction costs, on the settlement date when acquired, provided they are not recognized at fair value through profit and loss.\n\nFinancial assets are classified as financial assets measured at amortized cost (AmC), financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) and financial assets measured at fair value through profit and loss (FVPL) based on the business model and the characteristics of the cash flows.\n\nIf a financial asset is held for the purpose of collecting contractual cash flows and the cash flows of the financial asset represent exclusively interest and principal payments, then the financial asset is measured at amortized cost (AmC).",

Realized gains and losses are determined by analyzing each transaction individually.\n\nDebt instruments that do not exclusively serve to collect contractual cash flows or to both generate contractual cash flows and sales revenue, or whose cash flows do not exclusively consist of interest and principal payments are measured at fair value through profit and loss (FVPL). For equity instruments that are not held for trading purposes, E.ON does not exercise the FVOCI option.\n\nImpairments of financial assets are both recognized for losses already incurred and for expected future credit defaults. The amount of the impairment loss calculated in the determination of expected credit losses is recognized on the income statement.\n\nThe expected future credit loss is calculated by multiplying the probability of default by the carrying amount of the financial asset (exposure at default) and the expected loss ratio (loss given default). For information on the treatment of impairments under IFRS 9, please see Note 32.\n\nNon-derivative financial liabilities (including trade payables) within the scope of IFRS 9 are measured at amortized cost, using the effective interest method. Initial measurement takes place at fair value, with transaction costs included in the measurement. In the subsequent measurement, the residual carrying amount is adjusted by the amortization and accretion of any premium or\n\ndiscount remaining until maturity. The premium or discount is recognized in financial results over its term.\n\n## Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging\n\nDerivative financial instruments and separated embedded derivatives are measured at fair value as of the trading date at initial recognition. Under IFRS 9, they are classified as at fair value through profit and loss (FVPL) as long as they are not a component of a hedge accounting relationship. Gains and losses from changes in fair value are immediately recognized in net income.\n\nThe instruments primarily used are foreign currency forwards and cross-currency interest rate swaps, as well as interest rate swaps. In commodities, the instruments used primarily include physically and financially settled forwards and options related to electricity and gas.\n\nAs part of fair value measurement in accordance with IFRS 13, the counterparty risk is also taken into account for derivative financial instruments. E.ON determines this risk based on a portfolio valuation in a bilateral approach for both own credit risk (debt value adjustment) and the credit risk of the corresponding counterparty (credit value adjustment). The counterparty risks thus determined are allocated to the individual financial instruments by applying the relative fair value method on a net basis.\n\nE.ON has designated some of these derivatives as part of a hedging relationship. IFRS 9 sets requirements for the admissibility of hedging instruments and the underlyings, the formal designation and documentation of hedging relationships, the hedging strategy, as well as fulfilling requirements of effectiveness in order to qualify for hedge accounting. The designated hedged items and hedging instruments are subject to the same risk. This economic relationship ensures that the amounts of the hedged items and hedging instruments are offset against each other and that the hedging relationships are therefore effective. The hedge ratio of the hedges is 1:1. Ineffectiveness\n\narises only if the measurement parameters of the hedged item and the hedging instrument differ from one another or in the case of subsequent designation of the hedging instrument. All components of derivative gains and losses from the measurement of hedge ineffectiveness are taken into consideration during recognition.\n\nFor qualifying fair value hedges, the change in the fair value of the derivative and the change in the fair value of the hedged item that is due to the hedged risk(s) are recognized in income.\n\nIf a derivative instrument qualifies as a cash flow hedge under IFRS 9, the effective portion of the hedging instrument's change in fair value is recognized in equity (as a component of other comprehensive income) and reclassified into income in the period or periods during which the cash flows of the transaction being hedged affect income. In accordance with IFRS 9, the currency basis spread (hedging costs) will be separated from the hedging instrument and reported separately as an excluded component in accumulated other comprehensive income in the reserve for hedging costs as a component of equity.\n\nThe hedging result is reclassified into income during the period in which the cash flows of the hedged asset are recognized in income. The result is recognized immediately in income if it becomes probable that the hedged underlying transaction will no longer occur. For hedging instruments used to establish cash flow hedges, the change in fair value of the ineffective portion is recognized immediately in the income statement to the extent required.\n\nTo hedge the foreign currency risk arising from the Company's net investment in foreign operations, derivative as well as nonderivative financial instruments are used. Gains or losses due to changes in fair value and from foreign currency translation are recognized within equity, as a component of other comprehensive income, under currency translation adjustments.",

Gains and losses from interest-rate derivatives are included in interest income.\n\nUnrealized gains and losses resulting from the initial measurement of derivative financial instruments at the inception of the contract are not recognized in income. They are instead deferred and recognized in income systematically over the term of the derivative. An exception to the accrual principle applies if unrealized gains and losses from the initial measurement are verified by quoted market prices, observable prices of other current market transactions or other observable data supporting the valuation technique. In this case the gains and losses are recognized in income.\n\nE.ON holds portfolios of sales and procurement contracts for electricity and gas supplies with various customer and supplier groups (commodity futures). Contracts (in particular sales and procurement contracts for electricity and gas) that are entered into for purposes of receiving or delivering non-financial items in accordance with E.ON's anticipated procurement, sale or use requirements, and held as such, are generally classified as ownuse contracts.\n\nThey are not accounted for as derivative financial instruments at fair value through profit and loss (FVPL) in accordance with IFRS 9, but as pending transactions subject to the rules of IAS 37. Contracts that provide for net settlement and resales of the quantities to be delivered at a future date generally cannot, as a rule, be classified as own-use contracts. Based on forward-looking forecasts of delivery quantities specified by customer structure and portfolio management, contracts with physical settlement upon conclusion are recognized as derivatives for which settlement cannot be ensured within the scope of ordinary\n\ndelivery. This 'safety buffer' is reviewed on a regular basis and adjusted if necessary.\n\nEmbedded derivatives in own-use contracts must be separated from the host contract and accounted for as derivatives in accordance with IFRS 9 if the economic characteristics and risks of these derivatives are not closely related to those of the host contract. The contract is assessed upon conclusion to determine whether a derivative is required to be separated. A reassessment must be carried out if there is a significant change in the terms of the contract or in the context of business combinations.\n\nAgreements to buy or sell non-financial items that are not classified as own-use contracts under IFRS 9 and that are required to be accounted for as derivatives must be recognized in the balance sheet at their fair value until they are realized. At the time of physical settlement of such energy delivery contracts, the electricity or gas volumes delivered are measured at the market price prevailing at the time of physical fulfillment and the difference between the contracted price and the market price is recognized in other operating income. In addition, any income from commodity derivatives arising from the difference between the contract price and the market price is recognized in other operating income. In exceptional cases, commodity derivatives are designated as hedging instruments of a cash flow hedge in accordance with IFRS 9, and the effective part of the value change is recognized in equity as a component of other comprehensive income.\n\nIFRS 7, 'Financial Instruments: Disclosures' ('IFRS 7'), and IFRS 13 both require comprehensive quantitative and qualitative disclosures about the extent of risks arising from financial instruments. Additional information on financial instruments is provided in Notes 31 and 32.\n\nNon-derivative and derivative financial instruments are netted on the balance sheet if under IAS 32 E.ON has both an unconditional right-even in the event of the counterparty's insolvency-and the\n\nintention to settle offsetting positions simultaneously and/or on a net basis.\n\n## Inventories\n\nInventories are measured at the lower of acquisition or production cost and net realizable value. The cost of raw materials, finished products and goods purchased for resale is determined based on the average cost method. In addition to production materials and wages, production costs include material and production overheads based on normal capacity. The costs of general administration are not capitalized. Inventory risks resulting from excess and obsolescence are provided for using appropriate valuation allowances, whereby inventories are written down to net realizable value.\n\n## Emission Rights and Similar Certificates\n\nEmission rights and similar certificates held under national and international emissions trading systems for the settlement of obligations are capitalized at cost at the date of acquisition and reported under current assets. Subsequent measurement is at amortized cost under IAS 38.\n\nThe obligation to submit emission rights and similar certificates to the relevant authorities is recognized as a liability as of the balance sheet date. Measurement is based on the best estimate of the future settlement amount.\n\n## Receivables, Contract Assets or Liabilities and Other Assets\n\nA receivable is recognized under IFRS 15 when the goods or services are delivered, provided that the right to consideration is unconditional, i.e., is only related to the passage of time. However, if the right to receive the consideration is contingent upon conditions other than the passage of time, a contract asset is recognized. A contract liability under IFRS 15 is recognized when consideration has been received for an existing IFRS 15 contract and the right to receive the goods or services still exists in full or in part. The contractual liability is only reversed with an effect on revenue when E.ON has performed the corresponding service. An",

Other assets are amortized over the estimated term of the contract depending on how the goods or services to which the costs relate are transferred to the customer. If the estimated term of the contract is less than one year, the costs are immediately recognized as an expense on the income statement. Trade receivables without a significant financial component are measured upon initial recognition at their transaction price. Valuation allowances, included in the reported net carrying amount, are provided for identifiable individual risks. If the loss of a certain part of the receivables is probable, valuation allowances are provided to cover the expected loss. Impairments are also recognized for expected future credit losses.\n\n## Liquid Funds\n\nLiquid funds include checks, cash on hand, bank balances and current securities.\n\nLiquid funds with an original maturity of more than three months are recognized under securities and fixed-term deposits provided that their maturities are not more than 12 months and therefore are recognized under non-current financial receivables and other financial assets.\n\nLiquid funds with an original maturity of less than three months are considered to be cash and cash equivalents in accordance with IAS 7. This also applies if they are merely contractually restricted, in which case the funds can technically be disposed of at any time at E.ON's discretion. However, if, as a result of a restriction, liquid funds cannot technically be disposed of at any time at E.ON's discretion, they are reported separately as restricted liquid funds.\n\n## Assets Held for Sale and Liabilities Associated with Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations\n\nNon-current assets and any corresponding liabilities held for sale and any directly attributable liabilities are recognized separately from other assets and liabilities in the balance sheet in the line\n\nitems 'Assets held for sale' and 'Liabilities associated with assets held for sale' if they can be disposed of in their current condition and if there is sufficient probability of their disposal actually taking place. The reclassification to the separate balance sheet items is shown in the fixed asset movement schedule under Changes in scope of consolidation.\n\nDiscontinued operations are components of an entity that are either held for sale or have already been sold and can be clearly distinguished from other corporate operations, both operationally and for financial reporting purposes. Additionally, the component of the entity classified as a discontinued operation must represent a major business line or a specific material geographic business segment of the Group or a subsidiary acquired exclusively for resale.\n\nNon-current assets that are held for sale either individually or collectively as part of a disposal group, or that belong to a discontinued operation, are no longer depreciated. They are instead accounted for at the lower of the carrying amount and the fair value less any remaining costs to sell. If this value is less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognized in other operating expenses.\n\nThe income and losses resulting from the measurement of components held for sale as well as the gains and losses arising from the disposal of discontinued operations, are reported separately on the face of the income statement under income/loss from discontinued operations, net, as is the income from the ordinary operating activities of these divisions. Prior-year income statement figures are adjusted accordingly. The relevant assets and liabilities are reported in a separate line on the balance sheet. The cash flows of discontinued operations are reported separately in the cash flow statement, with prior-year figures adjusted accordingly. However, there is no reclassification of prior-year balance sheet line items attributable to discontinued operations.\n\n## Equity Instruments\n\nE.ON has entered into purchase commitments to holders of noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries. By means of these agreements, the non-controlling shareholders have the right to require E.ON to purchase their shares on specified conditions. None of the contractual obligations has led to the transfer of substantially all of the risk and rewards to E.ON at the time of entering into the contract. Under the anticipated acquisition method, however, the right of tender is accounted for as if it had already been exercised. Accordingly, the minority interests are derecognized-irrespective of the probability of the option being exercised-and at the same time a liability is recognized in the amount of the present value of the repurchase amount in accordance with IAS 32, 'Financial Instruments: Presentation' ('IAS 32'). The difference between this measurement and the carrying amount of the minority shareholders' equity to be derecognized is recognized in equity of E.ON SE shareholders. The accretion of the liability is recognized as interest expense. If a purchase commitment expires unexercised, the liability reverts to non-controlling interests. Any remaining difference is then recognized directly in equity in retained earnings.\n\nWhere shareholders of entities own statutory, non-excludable rights of termination (as in the case of German partnerships, for example), such termination rights require the reclassification of non-controlling interests from equity into liabilities under IAS 32. The liability is recognized at the present value of the expected settlement amount irrespective of the probability of termination. Changes in the value of the liability are reported within other operating income. Accretion of the share of the results of the noncontrolling shareholders' share in net income is recognized in Net interest income/expense. In the event that non-controlling shareholders are entitled to a guaranteed dividend, this entitlement is recognized as a liability through reclassification from non-controlling interests in equity.\n\nIf E.ON SE or a Group company buys treasury shares of E.ON SE, the value of the consideration paid, including directly attributable",

If such treasury shares are subsequently distributed or sold, the consideration received, net of acquisition costs, any directly attributable additional transaction costs and associated income taxes, is recognized in additional paid-in capital.\n\n## Share-Based Payment\n\nShare-based payment plans issued in the E.ON Group are accounted for in accordance with IFRS 2, 'Share-Based Payment' ('IFRS 2').\n\nIn fiscal years 2017 to 2023, virtual shares were granted to members of the Management Board of E.ON SE and certain E.ON Group executives under the new E.ON Performance Plan. See the Compensation Report for more details on the structure of the plan.\n\nThe E.ON Performance Plan represents commitments of the Company which provide for cash compensation based on the share price performance at the end of the term. The compensation expense is measured taking into account the fair value of the virtual shares granted and recognized in personnel expense pro rata over the vesting period.\n\nIn 2023, as in 2022, employees of E.ON SE and participating subsidiaries once again had the opportunity to purchase E.ON shares at favorable conditions under the employee stock purchase program. The program includes a share-based payment settled in equity instruments (shares of E.ON SE) as consideration for services rendered or work performed. The corresponding compensation under IFRS 2 was recognized in personnel expense and the offsetting entry was made in equity.\n\n## Provisions for Pensions and Similar Obligations\n\nMeasurement of defined benefit obligations in accordance with IAS 19, 'Employee Benefits,' is based on actuarial computations using the projected unit credit method, with actuarial valuations performed at year-end. The valuation encompasses both pension\n\nobligations and pension entitlements that are known on the reporting date and economic trend assumptions such as assumptions on wage and salary growth rates and pension increase rates, among others, that are made in order to reflect realistic expectations, as well as variables specific to reporting dates such as discount rates, for example.\n\nIncluded in gains and losses from the remeasurements of the net defined benefit liability or asset are actuarial gains and losses that may arise especially from differences between estimated and actual variations in underlying assumptions about demographic and financial variables. Additionally included is the difference between the actual return on plan assets and the expected interest income on plan assets included in the net interest result. Remeasurement effects are recognized in full in the period in which they occur and are not reported within the Consolidated Statements of Income, but are instead recognized within the Statements of Recognized Income and Expenses as part of equity.\n\nThe employer service cost representing the additional benefits that employees earned under the benefit plan during the fiscal year is reported under personnel costs; the net interest on the net liability or asset from defined benefit pension plans determined based on the discount rate applicable at the start of the fiscal year is reported under financial results.\n\nPast service cost, as well as gains and losses from settlements, are fully recognized in the income statement in the period in which the underlying plan amendment, curtailment or settlement takes place. They are reported under personnel costs.\n\nThe amount reported on the balance sheet represents the present value of the defined benefit obligations reduced by the fair value of plan assets. If a net asset position arises from this calculation, the amount is limited to the present value of available refunds and the reduction in future contributions and to the benefit from prepayments of minimum funding requirements. Such an asset position is recognized as an operating receivable.\n\nPayments for defined contribution pension plans are expensed as incurred and reported under personnel costs. Contributions to state pension plans are treated like payments for defined contribution pension plans to the extent that the obligations under these pension plans generally correspond to those under defined contribution pension plans.\n\n## Provisions for Asset Retirement Obligations and Other Miscellaneous Provisions\n\nIn accordance with IAS 37, 'Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets' ('IAS 37'), provisions are recognized when E.ON has a legal or constructive present obligation towards third parties as a result of a past event, it is probable that E.ON will be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. The provision is recognized at the expected settlement amount. Long-term obligations are reported as liabilities at the present value of their expected settlement amounts if the interest rate effect (the difference between present value and repayment amount) resulting from discounting is material; future cost increases that are foreseeable and likely to occur on the balance sheet date at year-end must also be included in the measurement. Long-term obligations are generally discounted at the market interest rate applicable as of the respective balance sheet date, provided that it is not negative. The accretion amounts and the effects of changes in interest rates are generally presented as part of financial results. A reimbursement related to the provision that is virtually certain to be collected is capitalized as a separate asset. No offsetting within provisions is permitted. Advance payments remitted are deducted from the provisions.\n\nObligations arising from the decommissioning or dismantling of property, plant and equipment are recognized during the period of their occurrence at their discounted settlement amounts, provided that the obligation can be reliably estimated, whereby no negative discount rates are applied. The carrying amounts of the respective property, plant and equipment are increased by the same amounts. In subsequent periods, capitalized asset retirement costs are",

Advance payments remitted are deducted from the provisions.\n\nChanges in estimates arise in particular from deviations from original cost estimates, from changes to the maturity or the scope of the relevant obligation, and also as a result of the regular adjustment of the discount rate to current market interest rates. The adjustment of provisions for the decommissioning and restoration of property, plant and equipment for changes to estimates is generally recognized by way of a corresponding adjustment to these assets, with no effect on income. As the property, plant and equipment concerned have, however, frequently already been fully depreciated, changes to estimates are primarily recognized within the income statement.\n\nThe estimates for nuclear decommissioning provisions are derived from studies, cost estimates, legally binding civil agreements and legal information. A material element in the estimates are the real interest rates applied (the applied discount rate, less the cost increase rate).\n\nIf onerous contracts exist in which the unavoidable costs of meeting a contractual obligation exceed the economic benefits expected to be received under the contract, provisions are established for losses from pending transactions. Such provisions are recognized at the lower of the excess obligation upon performance under the contract and any potential penalties or compensation arising in the event of non-performance. Obligations under an open contractual relationship are determined from a sales market perspective, in part on the basis of contract portfolios.\n\nProvisions for pending sales transactions must also be recognized if these transactions are subject to the own-use exemption under IFRS 9 and if they are partially offset by transactions that are accounted for as derivative financial instruments measured at\n\ncurrent market prices. As a result, provisions under IAS 37 are recognized for transactions actually subject to the own-use exemption, for the purpose of which the intrinsic values of the derivatives accounted for under IFRS 9 held in the procurement portfolio are taken into consideration in the calculation of the imputed performance costs. The book structure adopted under IFRS 9 therefore affects the accounting treatment of the corresponding provisions.\n\nContingent liabilities are possible obligations toward third parties arising from past events that are not wholly within the control of the entity, or else present obligations toward third parties arising from past events in which an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits is not probable or where the amount of the obligation cannot be measured with sufficient reliability. Contingent liabilities are not recognized on the balance sheet.\n\nA full disclosure of information is not provided for certain contingent liabilities, contingent receivables and provisions in connection with pending litigation if such disclosure could have a significant influence on further proceedings.\n\nProvisions for restructuring costs are recognized at the present value of the future outflows of resources. Provisions are recognized once a detailed restructuring plan has been decided on by management and whose implementation has either already begun or which have been publicly announced or communicated to the employees or their representatives. Only those expenses that are directly attributable to the restructuring measures are used in measuring the amount of the provision. Expenses associated with the future operation are not taken into consideration.\n\n## Income Taxes\n\nUnder IAS 12, 'Income Taxes' ('IAS 12'), deferred taxes are recognized on temporary differences arising between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities on the balance sheet and their tax bases (balance sheet liability method). Deferred taxes are recognized for temporary differences that will result in taxable or\n\ndeductible amounts when taxable income is calculated for future periods, unless those differences are the result of the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that, at the time of the transaction, affects neither accounting nor taxable profit/loss and does not generate any temporary differences in the same amount that are subject to tax or to deduction (initial differences). Uncertain tax positions are recognized at their most likely value or the expected value. IAS 12 further requires that deferred tax assets be recognized for unused tax loss carryforwards and unused tax credits. Deferred tax assets are recognized to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences and unused tax losses can be utilized. Each of the corporate entities is assessed individually with regard to the probability of a positive tax result in future years. The planning horizon is basically three to five years in this context. Any existing history of losses is incorporated in this assessment. For those tax assets to which these assumptions do not apply, the value of the deferred tax assets is reduced. Deferred taxes in connection with the global minimum tax ('Pillar II') are not recognized.\n\nDeferred tax liabilities caused by temporary differences associated with investments in affiliated and associated companies are recognized unless the timing of the reversal of such temporary differences can be controlled within the Group and it is probable that, owing to this control, the differences will in fact not be reversed in the foreseeable future.\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted or substantively enacted tax rates expected to be applicable for taxable income in the years in which temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of changes in tax rates and tax law is recognized in net income unless the change affects deferred taxes that had previously been recognized directly in equity. The change is generally recognized in the period in which the material legislative process is completed. Income taxes for transaction costs of an equity transaction are recognized directly in equity.",

E.ON is responding to this circumstance, in particular through the application of IFRIC 23, by continuously identifying and assessing the tax environment and the resulting effects. The most current information is then incorporated into the estimate parameters necessary for measuring the tax provisions. Accordingly, related potential interest rate effects are also assessed, measured and reported separately.\n\n## Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows\n\nIn accordance with IAS 7, 'Statement of Cash Flows,' the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows are classified in cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities.\n\n## Segment Information\n\nIn accordance with the so-called management approach required by IFRS 8, 'Operating Segments,' the internal reporting organization used by management for making decisions on operating matters is used to identify the Company's reportable segments. The internal performance measure used as the segment result is EBITDA adjusted to exclude certain non-operating effects (see Note 35). Transactions between the reportable segments are recorded at arm's length transfer prices.\n\n## Structure of the Consolidated Balance Sheets and Statement of Income\n\nIn accordance with IAS 1, 'Presentation of Financial Statements,' the Consolidated Balance Sheets have been prepared using a classified balance sheet structure. Assets that will be realized within 12 months of the reporting date, as well as liabilities that are due to be settled within one year of the reporting date are generally classified as current.\n\nThe Consolidated Statement of Income is classified using the nature of expense method, which is also applied for internal purposes.\n\n## Critical Accounting Estimates and Assumptions; Critical Judgments in the Application of Accounting Policies\n\nThe preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that may both influence the application of accounting principles within the Group and affect the measurement and presentation of reported figures. Estimates are based on past experience and on current knowledge obtained on the transactions to be reported. Actual amounts may differ from these estimates.\n\nThe estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis and are adjusted as necessary in the periods in which they were recognized.\n\nEstimates are particularly necessary for the measurement of the value of property, plant and equipment and of intangible assets, specifically in connection with purchase price allocations and determining the useful life, the recognition and measurement of deferred tax assets, the accounting treatment of provisions for pensions and other provisions (in particular provisions for the decommissioning of nuclear power plants and provisions for contingent losses from pending transactions involving the sale of electricity and gas), for impairment testing in accordance with IAS 36, as well as the determination of the fair value of certain financial instruments, as well as for the application of IFRS 15, and here in particular for the estimation of the value of electricity and gas units supplied, including the estimated values for units between the last settlement and the end of the period. Estimates are also factored in when applying IFRS 16, namely in connection with the determination of lease terms and the calculation of the discount rate, and in part when applying IFRS 9 in connection with the determination of expected future credit losses.\n\nThe application of accounting policies requires judgments to be made that may affect the amounts recognized in the financial statements. Judgments are relevant, for example, when assessing whether an item is to be classified in accordance with IFRS 5. Here, management assesses whether a disposal is considered highly\n\nprobable. Further judgments may be necessary in assessing whether E.ON controls, jointly controls with other investors, or can significantly influence an entity.\n\nSpecifically, management assesses here what the significant activities of the Company are, i.e., which activities have a material impact on the returns of the investee. The list of shareholdings (see Note 38) provides information on the form of inclusion in the consolidated financial statements of certain investees whose share of voting rights indicates a different form of inclusion.\n\nThe underlying principles used for estimates and judgments in the named topics and in additional relevant topics are outlined in the respective sections.\n\nCritical judgment is required in the recognition of risks arising from claims asserted by customers for the restitution of amounts collected through price adjustment measures (provisions in connection with price adjustments). Judgment is also required when assessing the potential recognition of assets or liabilities and their classification as contingent assets or liabilities (see Note 29).\n\nIn addition, estimates and judgments continue to be subject to increased uncertainty, in particular due to the significant volume and price volatilities on the energy markets and due to the war in Ukraine. The actual amounts may differ from the estimates and judgments made; changes may have a material impact on E.ON's net assets, financial position and results of operations. When the estimates and judgments were updated, all available information on expected economic developments and country-specific government measures was taken into account on the reporting date. It is difficult to predict the duration and the extent of the impact on assets, liabilities, earnings and cash flows of the war in Ukraine. More information on the impact of the war in Ukraine on the E.ON Group is presented in Note 3.",

This invasion is having far-reaching economic consequences, and direct impacts -particularly in the energy sector -are being experienced, which are also explained further in the 'Macroeconomic and Industry Environment' section of the Management Report.\n\nThe consequences of the war in Ukraine continue to have an impact on E.ON's business, primarily due to volatile commodity prices. Following the sharp rise in commodity prices seen in the previous year, they fell over the course of the reporting year but remained at a significantly higher level. This resulted in a declining market valuation of sales and procurement transactions recognized as derivatives in the balance sheet, as well as declines in these partially offsetting provisions for onerous contracts. The impacts are explained in more detail in the sections 'Earnings Situation,' 'Financial Situation' and 'Asset Situation' of the Management Report.\n\nThe situation assessable at the balance-sheet date with regard to the war in Ukraine indicated no triggering events that would necessitate impairment charges on non-current assets under IAS 36, in particular goodwill, other intangible assets, and property, plant and equipment.\n\nIn fiscal year 2023, high energy prices due to the war in Ukraine affected the ability of customers to pay significantly increased energy bills and led to additional impairment losses on trade receivables (see also the comments in Note 18).\n\nPotential balance sheet effects of the future development of the war in Ukraine are being analyzed on an ongoing basis.\n\nThe Europe-wide energy crisis has prompted the governments of some countries in which E.ON operates to adopt various measures\n\nto soften the impact on the end consumer. Some of these measures may directly impact E.ON, such as the introduction of price caps or the elimination of excess earnings. In particular, the price caps could have a direct impact on E.ON's revenues under IFRS 15. However, these charges did not have a material effect on E.ON's earnings in the 2023 financial year. For example, negative effects from price caps were primarily offset by government grants, which were in part recognized as grants related to income in accordance with IAS 20 (see the comments in Notes 6 and 9). There are also government measures that do not directly affect E.ON, such as the temporary assumption of energy costs for the end consumer.\n\n## (4) Scope of Consolidation\n\nThe number of consolidated companies changed as follows in 2023:\n\n## Scope of Consolidation\n\n|                                                 |   Domestic |   Foreign |   Total |\n|-------------------------------------------------|------------|-----------|---------|\n| Consolidated companies  as of January 1, 2022   |        166 |       156 |     322 |\n| Additions                                       |          4 |         3 |       7 |\n| Disposals/Mergers                               |          4 |        16 |      20 |\n| Consolidated companies  as of December 31, 2022 |        166 |       143 |     309 |\n| Additions                                       |          5 |         4 |       9 |\n| Disposals/Mergers                               |          7 |        18 |      25 |\n| Consolidated companies  as of December 31, 2023 |        164 |       129 |     293 |\n\nIn 2023, a total of 53 domestic and 10 foreign associated companies were consolidated under the equity method (2022: 54 domestic companies and 10 foreign companies). One domestic company reported as joint operations was presented pro rata on the Consolidated Financial Statements (2022: one domestic company).\n\n## (5) Material Acquisitions, Disposals and Disposal Groups in 2023\n\n## Consortium Agreement with RheinEnergie\n\nOn June 29, 2021, Westenergie AG, a fully consolidated subsidiary of the E.ON Group, entered into a consortium agreement with RheinEnergie AG. The agreement was finalized effective March 31, 2023, after the conditions imposed by the Bundeskartellamt (German Federal Cartel Office) were met. With the closing of the transaction, Westenergie and RheinEnergie merged shareholdings in individual municipal utilities into rhenag Rheinische Energie Aktiengesellschaft ('rhenag'). It also resulted in the initial consolidation of AggerEnergie GmbH within the E.ON Group. Westenergie also transferred 20 percent of the shares of Stadtwerke Duisburg, which, pursuant to IFRS 5, was previously included in E.ON's Consolidated Financial Statements as an associated company, to RheinEnergie, which increased its share in RheinEnergie from 20 to 24.2 percent.\n\nThe acquisition cost of a business combination is generally determined based on the fair values of the assets transferred as consideration, the liabilities assumed and the equity interests issued by the acquirer at the acquisition date. Because the shares in AggerEnergie were acquired in the course of a complex swap transaction, in accordance with IFRS 3.33, no determination was carried out at the acquisition date of the rhenag shares transferred in the framework of the overall swap transaction. Instead, the shares in AggerEnergie acquired were measured as of the acquisition date of March 31, 2023. The acquisition cost of the 62.7 percent shareholding determined on this basis amounts to \u20ac137 million. Accordingly, there is no need to allocate the consideration to major classes of consideration in accordance with IFRS 3.B64(f). The non-cash swap and the different value transfers to rhenag reduce the shareholding in rhenag from 66.67 percent to 45.56 percent. Contingent consideration and compensatory assets were not included in the agreement.",

These mainly consist of trade receivables (\u20ac58 million).\n\nThe 37.3 percent non-controlling interest is measured using the partial goodwill method for identified pro rata net assets. Goodwill mainly reflects the value of assets that may not be recognized separately, such as the workforce and expected synergies.\n\nNo significant transaction costs were incurred for the acquisition of control over AggerEnergie GmbH.\n\nThe acquisition contributed \u20ac0.2 billion to revenue and \u20ac15 million to consolidated net income from April 1, 2023, to December 31, 2023. If the acquisition had been completed by January 1, 2023, the revenue contribution of AggerEnergie GmbH would have been around \u20ac0.1 billion and the contribution to consolidated net income would have been in the low single-digit million euro range.\n\nThe purchase price allocation to the identified assets and liabilities was made on a provisional basis due to the ongoing process of preparing and reviewing the underlying financial information. Consequently, changes to the allocation of the purchase price to the individual assets and liabilities may still be made within the agreed adjustment period of up to 12 months.\n\n## Closing of the Future Consolidation Agreement by ZSE shareholders\n\nOn April 8, 2022, the shareholders of Z\u00e1padoslovensk\u00e1 energetika a.s. ('ZSE') and V\u00fdchodoslovensk\u00e1 energetika Holding a.s. ('VSEH'), E.ON SE and the Slovak Republic, concluded a Future Consolidation Agreement to combine ZSE and the VSEH Group. The agreement provides, among other things, for 100 percent of the VSEH shares to be transferred to ZSE, the sale of all subsidiaries of VSEH to ZSE, and the implementation of corporate law changes at VSEH.\n\nThe transfer of VSEH shares to ZSE results in ZSE being VSEH's sole shareholder (and thus also shareholder of the VSEH subsidiaries). The ownership interests in ZSE remains unchanged; that is, E.ON has a 49 percent stake in ZSE and the Slovakian state a 51 percent stake. The new ZSE shareholder agreement essentially corresponds to the shareholder agreement that has been in force before. After closing of the agreement, ZSE continues to be accounted for using the equity method in E.ON's Consolidated Financial Statements, while the business activities of VSEH, which was previously fully consolidated, are now integrated in this joint venture.\n\nThe transaction was originally expected to be closed by the end of 2022. Accordingly, the VSEH Group has been presented as a disposal group in accordance with IFRS 5 since December 31, 2021. The last condition precedent was fulfilled on June 12, 2023. On November 23, 2023, all closing conditions were formally met, in particular the signing of the relevant documents such as the agreement on the transfer and contribution of the shares and the amended and restated shareholders' agreement as well as registration by the Slovak Central Depositary of Securities of the transfer of all of the VSEH's shares to ZSE and publication of all relevant documents with Central Register of Contracts. As of this date, the VSEH Group was deconsolidated and the value of the investment in ZSE was increased accordingly by the fair value of these VSEH shares.\n\nThe deconsolidation of VSEH resulted in a gain of \u20ac15 million. As the shares of VSEH were transferred to the ZSE, there was no gain/loss on the revaluation of a remaining stake in VSEH. The divested assets (before deduction of minority interests) consisted of \u20ac1,001 million in non-current assets and \u20ac415 million in current assets. In addition, goodwill of \u20ac104 million was allocated. Outgoing liabilities (before deduction of minority interests) consisted of \u20ac738 million in liabilities, \u20ac15 million in provisions and \u20ac127 million in deferred tax liabilities.\n\nDeconsolidation results are generally allocated to other operating income.\n\n## Discontinued Operations\n\nIncome from discontinued operations in the amount of \u20ac61 million resulted from a transaction already completed in 2005. In accordance with the purchase agreement, a one-time purchaseprice adjustment was made after an audit of the divested company was completed in the first quarter of 2023, and the contractual clause now took effect.",

In contrast, and more than offsetting this development, there was a significant reduction due to price developments on the commodity markets. This was due to forward contracted sales volumes, which are accounted for as a derivative in accordance with IFRS 9. The resulting sales must be reported at market prices at the time of physical delivery. The decreased revenues are mainly related to income as well as expenses from derivative financial instruments, which are reported under other operating income.\n\nRevenue realized in the current reporting period and resulting from performance obligations that had already been fulfilled in whole or in part in previous reporting periods amounted to \u20ac0.8 billion (2022: \u20ac0.7 billion). As of December 31, 2023, the total amount of performance obligations already contracted but still outstanding (excluding expected contract extensions and expected new contracts) amounted to \u20ac30.8 billion (December 31, 2022: \u20ac43.6 billion). The greater part of these performance obligations is expected to be fulfilled within the next three years. In the E.ON Group, revenues are mainly realized over time. Revenues that were not recognized under IFRS 15 but under other accounting standards totaled \u20ac5.4 billion in fiscal 2023 (2022: \u20ac5.1 billion). Of this, \u20ac5.2 billion was attributable to income-related government grants from the public sector (2022: \u20ac1.6 billion).\n\nRevenues are broken down in detail into intragroup and external revenues in the segment information (Note 35). They are also broken down into key regions and technologies. The overview also shows the effect of revenues on operating cash flow before interest and taxes.\n\n## (7) Own Work Capitalized\n\nOwn work capitalized amounted to \u20ac1,334 million in 2023 (2022: \u20ac997 million) and resulted primarily from capitalized work performed in connection with ongoing and completed IT projects and network assets.\n\n## (8) Other Operating Income and Expenses\n\nThe table below provides details of other operating income for the periods indicated:\n\n## Other Operating Income\n\n| \u20ac in millions                                                              | 2023   | 2022   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Income from exchange rate differences                                      | 578    | 853    |\n| Gain on derivative financial instruments  (including currency derivatives) | 37,273 | 70,234 |\n| Gain on disposal of non-current assets and  securities                     | 151    | 999    |\n| Gain on the reversal of provisions                                         | 29     | 16     |\n| Miscellaneous                                                              | 857    | 1,091  |\n| Total                                                                      | 38,888 | 73,193 |\n\nOther operating income decreased by \u20ac34,305 million to \u20ac38,888 million (2022: \u20ac73,193 million).\n\nIncome and expenses from derivative financial instruments (including currency derivatives) relate to fair value measurement under IFRS 9.\n\nIncome from derivative financial instruments decreased year-onyear by \u20ac32,961 million to \u20ac37,273 million (2022: \u20ac70,234 million), mainly due to price developments on the commodity markets. Commodity derivatives generated income in the amount of \u20ac35,931 million (2022: \u20ac68,302 million). In addition, income from derivative financial instruments (including\n\ncurrency derivatives) includes realized income from currency derivatives of \u20ac1,174 million (2022: \u20ac1,632 million).\n\nConversely, income from currency translation effects decreased by \u20ac275 million to \u20ac578 million. Corresponding items from derivative financial instruments (including currency derivatives) are included in other operating expenses. The effects of foreign currency translation within other operating income amounted to \u20ac611 million (2022: \u20ac2,143 million).\n\nThe gain on the disposal of property, plant and equipment and securities were \u20ac848 million below prior year. In 2022 there were gains on the disposal of Westconnect GmbH in the amount of \u20ac810 million. Gains were realized on the sale of securities in the amount of \u20ac51 million (2022: \u20ac26 million).\n\nMiscellaneous other operating income decreased by \u20ac234 million compared with the prior year.\n\nMiscellaneous other operating income also includes items such as transactions other than ordinary business activities in the amount of \u20ac105 million (2022: \u20ac212 million), income from contract penalties of \u20ac67 million (2022: \u20ac83 million), rental and lease income of \u20ac59 million (2022: \u20ac58 million) and income from the reversal of investment grants in the amount of \u20ac25 million (2022: \u20ac104 million).",

The decrease is due to the \u20ac13,318 million decline in expenses from derivative financial instruments (including currency derivatives) to \u20ac53,345 million (2022: \u20ac66,663 million). Similar to the development in income from derivative financial instruments, this was mainly due to price developments on the commodity markets over the course of the year.\n\nExpenses from commodity derivatives amounted to \u20ac52,026 million in 2023 (2022: \u20ac64,615 million). In addition, expenses from derivative financial instruments (including currency derivatives) includes realized expenses from currency derivatives of \u20ac1,312 million (2022: \u20ac1,473 million).\n\nExpenses from exchange rate differences in the amount of \u20ac718 million increased by \u20ac194 million compared with the previous year (\u20ac524 million).\n\nForeign currency translation effects within other operating expenses amounted to \u20ac707 million (2022: \u20ac1,880 million).\n\nMiscellaneous other operating expenses includes third-party services and passthrough charges in the amount of \u20ac1,204 million (2022: \u20ac981 million). Also included are IT expenses in the amount of \u20ac654 million (2022: \u20ac480 million), advertising and marketing expenses in the amount of \u20ac279 million (2022: \u20ac177 million, as well as consulting and audit fees in the amount of \u20ac217 million (2022: \u20ac155 million). Additionally reported under this item are office expenses in the amount of \u20ac121 million (2022: \u20ac104 million), repair expenses in the amount of \u20ac110 million (2022: \u20ac89 million), travel expenses in the amount of \u20ac98 million (2022: \u20ac71 million), contributions and fees in the amount of \u20ac67 million (2022: \u20ac64 million), insurance premiums in the amount of \u20ac66 million (2022: \u20ac56 million), and rents and leases in the amount of \u20ac60 million (2022: \u20ac54 million).\n\n## (9) Cost of Materials\n\nThe principal components of expenses for raw materials and supplies and for purchased goods are the purchase of gas and electricity. Fuel supply is also included in this line item in the previous year. Expenses for purchased services consist primarily of network usage charges and maintenance costs.\n\n## Cost of Materials\n\n| \u20ac in millions                                                    | 2023   | 2022    |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|---------|\n| Expenses for raw materials and supplies and  for purchased goods | 47,968 | 93,141  |\n| Expenses for purchased services                                  | 16,260 | 15,486  |\n| Total                                                            | 64,228 | 108,627 |\n\nCost of materials of \u20ac64,228 million was significantly lower than the prior-year level of \u20ac108,627 million. This sharp decrease was mainly due to energy price developments on the commodity markets. Under the long-term procurement strategy, higher energy prices in the first half of last year exerted persistent upward pressure on procurement costs even into the second half\n\nof the year, in spite of the fact that the overall price trend in 2023 was downward. This was partially offset by the fact that forward procurement contracts are recognized as derivative financial instruments in accordance with IFRS, and on recognition this requires adjustment to the market price at the time of delivery. Accordingly, income from the market valuation of commodity derivatives is recognized in other operating income.\n\nIn addition, the change in provisions for contracted sales transactions reported that are not subject to IFRS 9 (so-called own-use contracts), which are economically part of a portfolio that is partly offset by procurement transactions to be accounted for as derivative financial instruments. Provisions were significantly reduced in the current reporting period.\n\nGovernment subsidies received reduced the cost of materials by \u20ac453 million (2022: \u20ac774 million).",

The decline in net interest income is mainly due to the fact that interest rates fell moderately compared to the previous year. This eliminated the very positive effect of the previous year, when a significant rise in interest rates had resulted in high income from the discounting of provisions.\n\nThe amortized cost reported in interest and similar income includes positive effects from cash investments in the amount of \u20ac150 million (2022: \u20ac32 million).\n\nThe amortized cost reported in interest and similar expenses included the positive effect from the difference between the nominal interest rate and the effective interest rate of former innogy bonds, which was adjusted due to the purchase price allocation, in the amount of \u20ac187 million, which is \u20ac17 million lower than in the previous year. This item was also negatively impacted by the increased interest expense from the newly issued bonds, which was higher than the decreased interest expense from the matured bonds. This was offset by the effects on earnings of \u20ac7 million (2022: \u20ac80 million) from non-controlling interests in subsidiaries that have already been fully consolidated and interests in fully consolidated partnerships, which are to be recognized as liabilities in accordance with IAS 32, and with legal structures that give their shareholders a statutory right of withdrawal combined with an entitlement to a settlement payment. Capitalized interest on debt (\u20ac8 million; 2022: \u20ac8 million) remained unchanged in interest expenses.\n\nThe valuation effects of securities recognized at fair value through P&L are included in both income (\u20ac86 million; 2022: \u20ac35 million) and expenses (-\u20ac35 million; 2022: -\u20ac236 million) from fair value through P&L.\n\nOther interest income consists of interest income from discounting provisions for asset retirement obligations in the amount of \u20ac0 million (2022: \u20ac1,338 million), provisions for recultivation and remediation obligations in the amount of \u20ac77 million (2022: \u20ac253 million) and other non-current provisions in the amount of \u20ac31 million (2022: \u20ac302 million).\n\nOther interest expenses mainly relate to net interest expenses from pension provisions of \u20ac114 million (2022: \u20ac51 million) and from the discounting of provisions for asset retirement obligations of \u20ac224 million (2022: \u20ac0 million) as well as the regular accretion of other non-current provisions of \u20ac245 million (2022: \u20ac1 million).",

The income tax rate of 31 percent corresponds to the tax rate applicable to E.ON SE for 2023.

This corresponds to a theoretical tax rate of -592 percent. This was primarily due to market valuations of commodity derivatives in various countries with different tax rates, which resulted in a higher tax rate. In addition, the tax rate was influenced by changes in the value of deferred tax assets as well as taxes for previous years.",

The change in previously unrecognized tax losses and temporary differences reduced deferred tax expense by \u20ac77 million (2022: \u20ac71 million).\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, E.ON reported deferred tax assets for companies that incurred losses in the current or the prior-year period that exceed the deferred tax liabilities by \u20ac2,028 million (2022: \u20ac478 million). Of this amount, \u20ac1,672 million is attributable to companies in Germany and \u20ac339 million to companies in the UK. These amounts mainly include deductible temporary differences. Recognition in the UK is due to the fact that expenses for the integration of new business activities and processes that led to tax losses in the past are non-recurring. In Germany, recognition is based, among other factors, on taxable profits realized in the current financial year and on sufficient taxable profits in subsequent financial years. These factors are based on scenario analyses as well as stable earnings contributions\n\nfrom the regulated area. E.ON also expects derivative financial instruments recognized at negative fair value to have a positive effect on non-operating earnings through a reversal during the planning period. When considered in the aggregate, the management has concluded that each company will generate sufficient taxable income against which the previously unused tax losses and deductible temporary differences can be offset.\n\nIncome taxes recognized in other comprehensive income break down as follows:\n\n## Income Taxes of Other Comprehensive Income\n\n| \u20ac in millions             |   2023 |   2022 |\n|---------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Deferred taxes within OCI |    602 |    124 |\n| Current taxes within OCI  |     -2 |    -13 |\n| Total                     |    600 |    111 |",

Changes in deferred tax liabilities, with net additions of \u20ac65 million, relate primarily to property, plant and equipment (+\u20ac39 million), receivables (+\u20ac34 million) and liabilities (-\u20ac16 million).\n\nChanges in deferred tax assets in the prior year, with net disposals of \u20ac1 million, relate mainly to intangible assets (+\u20ac12 million), property, plant and equipment (+\u20ac11 million) and liabilities (-\u20ac18 million). Changes in deferred tax liabilities, with net disposals of \u20ac20 million, relate primarily to intangible assets (+\u20ac15 million), property, plant and equipment (-\u20ac48 million) and receivables (-\u20ac11 million) as well as liabilities (+\u20ac25 million).\n\nThe VSEH Group has been presented as a disposal group in accordance with IFRS 5 since December 31, 2021. The transaction was then concluded on November 23, 2023 (see Note 5). The VSEH Group was deconsolidated on this date and the value of the investment in ZSE was increased accordingly by the fair value of these VSEH shares. The deconsolidation of VSEH resulted in the derecognition of deferred tax liabilities in the amount of \u20ac127 million.\n\n## Global Minimum Tax\n\nThe E.ON Group is included in the scope of application of the OECD Model Rules of Pillar 2 for the national implementation of the global minimum tax. The Model Rules were transposed into German law through the introduction of a minimum tax law in December 2023, which applies to all fiscal years beginning after December 31, 2023. Because the legislation had not entered into force as at the reporting date in any country in which the E.ON Group has business units as defined by the legislation, there was no current tax exposure associated with it for the 2023 fiscal year. The E.ON Group applies the exemption in IAS 12 for the recognition and disclosure of information on deferred tax assets and liabilities in connection with income taxes from global minimum taxation.\n\nThe minimum tax legislation applicable from 2024 requires E.ON to determine the effective tax rate for each country in which business units as defined by the law exist and, if the effective tax rate determined is below the minimum tax rate of 15 percent, to pay a so-called supplementary tax equal to the difference between the effective tax rate and the minimum tax rate.\n\nAn initial indicative analysis was carried out as of the reporting date to determine the fundamental impact and the jurisdictions in which E.ON could be exposed to potential effects in connection with a supplementary tax.\n\nThe first step was to determine whether the safe harbor regulations were applicable. The effective tax rate was calculated on a simplified basis for countries that were not exempt from the Pillar 2 calculation after a review of the safe harbor rules.\n\nThis initial indicative analysis did not identify any countries in which the E.ON Group operates that could result in a material impact in the form of a supplementary tax. Consequently, E.ON is currently not expected to be materially affected by a supplementary tax. Accordingly, the average effective Group tax rate would have remained unchanged if the minimum tax legislation had already been in force on the balance sheet date.",

The change is primarily attributable to the higher headcount and tariff increases. This is counteracted by lower expenses for pensions.\n\n## Share-Based Payment\n\nThe expenses for share-based payment in 2023 (the E.ON Performance Plan) amounted to \u20ac93.3 million (2022: \u20ac24.6 million).\n\n## Employee Stock Purchase Program\n\nThe voluntary employee stock purchase program took place again in 2023, giving employees in the German Group companies the opportunity once again to purchase E.ON shares at favorable conditions. The favorable pricing conditions granted within the framework of the employee stock purchase program (IFRS 2, 'Share-based Payment') resulted in personnel expense of \u20ac6.7 million; the offsetting entry was made in equity.\n\n## Long-term Variable Compensation\n\nMembers of the Management Board of E.ON SE and certain executives of the E.ON Group receive share-based payment as part of their voluntary long-term variable compensation. The purpose of such compensation is to reward their contribution to E.ON's growth and to further the long-term success of the Company. This variable compensation component, comprising a long-term incentive effect along with a certain element of risk, provides for a logical linking of the interests of shareholders and management.\n\nThe following discussion includes reports on the E.ON Performance Plan introduced in 2017.\n\n## E.ON Performance Plan (EPP)\n\nIn the years 2017 to 2023, E.ON granted the members of the Management Board of E.ON SE and certain executives of the E.ON Group virtual shares under the E.ON Performance Plan. The vesting period of each tranche is four years. Vesting periods start on January 1 of each year.\n\nThe beneficiary will receive virtual shares in the amount of the agreed target. The conversion into virtual shares will be based on the fair market value on the date when the shares are granted. The number of virtual shares allocated may change during the fouryear vesting period. For tranches granted through 2021, the only relevant criterion was the total shareholder return ('TSR') of E.ON stock compared with the TSR of the companies in a peer group ('relative TSR'). The final number of virtual shares allocated in the 2022 tranche depends on three performance criteria, namely, relative TSR, ROCE, and the E.ON Sustainability Index.\n\nThe TSR is the return on E.ON stock, which takes into account the stock price plus the assumption of reinvested dividends, adjusted for changes in capital. The peer group used for relative TSR will be the other companies in E.ON's peer index, the STOXX \u00ae Europe 600 Utilities. During a tranche's vesting period, E.ON's TSR\n\nperformance is measured once a year in comparison with the companies in the peer group and set for that year.\n\nThe E.ON Sustainability Index reflects the four most relevant ESG aspects (ESG = Environment, Social, Governance) at E.ON. In 2023 these aspects were: climate action, diversity, health and safety, and ESG ratings.\n\nFor the tranches granted up to and including 2021, the final number of virtual shares is determined as follows: E.ON's TSR performance in a given year determines the final number of onefourth of the virtual shares granted at the beginning of the vesting period. If target attainment in a year is below the threshold defined by the Supervisory Board upon allocation, the number of virtual shares is reduced by one-fourth. If E.ON's performance is at the upper cap or above, the fourth of the virtual shares allocated for the year in question will increase, but to a maximum of 150 percent.\n\nFor the tranche granted beginning in 2022, in addition to TSR (50 percent weighting), ROCE (25 percent weighting) and the E.ON Sustainability Index (25 percent weighting) are also taken into account as performance criteria.\n\nThe resulting number of virtual shares at the end of the vesting period is multiplied by the average price of E.ON stock in the final 60 days of the vesting period. This amount is increased by the dividends distributed on E.ON stock during the vesting period and then paid out. The sum of the payouts is capped at 200 percent of the agreed target.\n\nThe virtual shares are canceled if the employment relationship of the beneficiary ends before the end of the term for reasons within the control of the beneficiary. If the employment relationship of the beneficiary is terminated before retirement, through the end of a limited term or for operational reasons before the end of the term, the virtual shares do not expire but are settled at maturity.",

The same shall apply in the case of a change in control related to E.ON SE and also if the allocating company leaves the E.ON Group before maturity.\n\nThe following are the base parameters of the tranches of the E.ON Performance Plan active in 2023:\n\n## E.ON Performance Plan Virtual Shares\n\n|                          | 7th tranche   | 6th tranche   | 5th tranche   | 4th tranche   |\n|--------------------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|\n| Date of issuance         | Jan. 1, 2023  | Jan. 1, 2022  | Jan. 1, 2021  | Jan. 1, 2020  |\n| Term                     | 4 years       | 4 years       | 4 years       | 4 years       |\n| Target value at issuance | \u20ac 9.32        | \u20ac 12.76       | \u20ac 7.65        | \u20ac 7.88        |\n\nThe provision for the fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh tranches of the E.ON Performance Plan as of the balance sheet date is \u20ac165.0 million (2022: \u20ac92.9 million). The expense for the fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh tranches amounted to \u20ac93.3 million in the 2023 fiscal year (2022: \u20ac24.6 million).\n\n## Employees\n\nIn 2023, E.ON employed an average personnel of 71,629 (2022: 68,888).

Because there were no binding sales transactions or market prices for the respective cash-generating units in 2023, fair values were calculated based on discounted cash flow methods.\n\nValuations are based on the medium-term corporate planning authorized by the Management Board. The calculations for impairment-testing purposes are generally based on the three planning years of the medium-term plan plus two additional detailed planning years. Deviations from this are made in certain justified exceptional cases. The cash flow assumptions extending beyond the detailed planning period are determined using sustainable, business and currency-specific growth rates based on the analysis of past years and predictions for the future. In 2023, the sustainable, currency-specific inflation rate used for the euro area was 1.25 percent (2022: 1.25 percent). The discount rates after taxes used for discounting cash flows in the annual impairment test are calculated using market data for each cashgenerating unit, and as of the valuation date, ranged between 4.3 and 12.6 percent after taxes (2022: between 3.9 and 13.0 percent).\n\nThe principal assumptions underlying the determination by management of recoverable amount are the respective forecasts for E.ON's investment activity, the regulatory framework, as well as for growth rates and the cost of capital, of revenue and EBITDA margin (in the Customer Solutions business) and Regulatory Asset Base and regulatory return (in the Energy Networks business). The assumptions used in these forecasts regarding the development of commodity market prices, future electricity and gas prices in the wholesale and retail markets are based on external market data from reputable suppliers as well as internal assessments and also appropriately take into account climate-related impacts on market conditions and macroeconomic linkages as well as the sustainability targets anchored in the Group strategy, such as the reduction of Scope 3 emissions by 100 percent by 2050. For example, impacts of climate targets on CO2 prices and changing weather conditions (temperature, wind, etc.) are included. The assumed development of all of the key influencing factors mentioned corresponds to the expectations set out in the forecast report.",

        "page_content": "- \u2192 Consolidated Statement of Income \u2192 Consolidated Statement of Recognized Income and Expenses \u2192 Consolidated Balance Sheets\n- \u2192 Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows\n- \u2192\n- Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity \u2192 Notes\n\nOverall, medium-term planning assumes that the regulatory environment will remain stable.\n\nAgainst the backdrop of the expansion of the network, which is key to achieving climate protection targets, the detailed planning period provides for a significant increase in investments in the Energy Networks Germany segment, with a corresponding increase in the regulated asset base. We expect regulatory returns to remain stable.\n\nIn the Customer Solutions Germany and UK segments, we anticipate a significant increase in investments and a significant decline in sales revenue during our detailed planning period compared to the 2023 financial year. The decline in revenues in spite of a comparable number of customers is due to the assumption that prices on the commodity markets will normalize. We expect a moderate increase in estimated EBITDA margins in the detailed planning period in the Customer Solutions UK and Germany segments due to the planned portfolio optimization and the expansion of our growth business areas.\n\nThe above discussion applies accordingly to the testing for impairment of intangible assets and of property, plant and equipment and investments subject to the application of the equity method (IAS 28), and of groups of these assets. If the goodwill of a cash-generating unit is combined with assets or groups of assets for impairment testing, the assets must be tested first.\n\n## Goodwill\n\nOn September 11, 2023, the Board of Management of E.ON SE adopted a new management concept for the Group. This will take effect from 1 January, 2024, and, due to the concept in IFRS 8, will require a change in the definition of the operating segments and thus also a reallocation of the existing goodwill of all segments affected by the changes as of 1 January, 2024. The decision of the Board of Management was seen as a triggering event to review the recoverability of these goodwill amounts. As of September 2023, no impairment losses were identified.\n\nThe performance of the annual goodwill impairment tests in the 2023 financial year did not result in any impairments under IAS 36. The determination of a value in use was not necessary for any cash generating unit.\n\nThe tested goodwill of all cash-generating units whose respective goodwill as of the balance sheet date is material in relation to the total carrying amount of all goodwill shows a surplus of recoverable amounts over the respective carrying amounts and, therefore, based on current assessment of the economic situation, only a significant change in the material valuation parameters that is not considered realistic would necessitate the recognition of goodwill impairment.\n\nIn 2023, impairments were recognized on the goodwill of the Slovakian operations after they were classified as held for sale under IFRS 5 since the fourth quarter of 2021 (see Note 5 for more information). These required impairments amounted to approximately \u20ac44 million and are attributable to the fact that the fair value less costs of disposal was below the carrying amount of the disposal group. An impairment loss in such a case will always be allocated first to the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the disposal group. In November 2023, following the closing of the Future Consolidation Agreements the VSEH has been deconsolidated (see also Note 5).\n\n## Intangible Assets\n\nIn 2023, approximately \u20ac63 million of impairments were recognized on intangible assets. In terms of amount, the largest impairment loss occurred in the Customer Solutions Germany segment. The German Sales Technology Platform, a platform for technological solutions in German sales, was written down by \u20ac44 million on an unscheduled basis. The migration of certain customers planned for calendar year 2023 has been postponed indefinitely. In addition, the current medium-term planning no longer includes costs for multi-client capability, but costs for the continuation of the previous billing systems. As of December 31,\n\n2023, the new carrying amount of the sales platform, which consists of several assets and sub-assets, amounts to \u20ac84 million.\n\nReversals of impairments on intangible assets amounted to around \u20ac30 million in the current year. A write-up of \u20ac30 million was recognized on the Delgaz power grid in the cash generating unit Energy Networks Romania, bringing the new carrying amount to \u20ac521 million. The main reasons for this are the more stable market environment compared to 2021 with a functioning allocation mechanism, including a price cap for energy procurement for the distribution system operator's technological consumption, as well as the positive development of the regulatory asset base.\n\nIn 2023, the Company recorded an amortization expense on intangible assets of \u20ac606 million (2022: \u20ac714 million).\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, the closing balance of intangible assets with an indefinite useful life amounted to \u20ac82 million (2022: \u20ac308 million). These assets are mainly attributable to concession rights from the Swedish energy grid with a value of \u20ac37 million. In 2023, easements/rights of way from the Energy Network Germany segment in the amount of \u20ac237 million were reclassified from an indefinite useful life to a limited useful life. Implementation has been done prospectively in accordance with IAS 8.36.\n\nIn the year under review, \u20ac104 million (2022: \u20ac68 million) of research and development costs within the meaning of IAS 38 were recognized as expenses.\n\n## Rights of Use\n\nIn 2023, the Company recorded an amortization expense of \u20ac417 million (2022: \u20ac393 million). Impairment charges on rights of use amounted to \u20ac2 million (2022: \u20ac3 million).\n\n## Property, Plant and Equipment\n\nImpairments on property, plant and equipment amounted to \u20ac114 million in 2023.",

Two geothermal plants in Kirchwaidach (by \u20ac25 million) and Heidelberg (by \u20ac12 million) were impaired to their new carrying amounts of \u20ac15 million and \u20ac47 million, respectively. The main reasons for the impairments were the expected sustained decline in earnings as well as disagreements with the customer of one plant regarding further investment requirements. In addition, in the past, construction work on one of the large biomass power plant projects (Green Steam H\u00fcrth) had been significantly delayed due to the Covid-19 pandemic, rising procurement costs and financial challenges on the part of our technical suppliers. Although these problems have been solved in the meantime, based on the latest assessments of the business case, there was an impairment loss of \u20ac28 million (new carrying amount \u20ac142 million).\n\nIn the UK, impairment losses amounted to \u20ac29 million, mainly due to the full write-off of conventional meters that were no longer needed and which have been replaced by smart energy meters (\u20ac14 million), as well as the impairment on the Monkerton combined heat and power plant (\u20ac13 million, new book value \u20ac25 million) due to lower earnings expectations and higher cost of capital.\n\nReversals of impairments on property, plant and equipment amounted to around \u20ac3 million in the current year (2022: \u20ac17 million).\n\nDepreciation amounted to \u20ac2,313 million in 2023 (2022: \u20ac2,219 million).\n\nIn 2023, land and buildings as well as technical equipment and machinery in the amount of \u20ac173 million (2022: \u20ac0 million) were subject to restrictions on disposal.\n\nBorrowing costs in the amount of \u20ac8 million were capitalized in 2023 (2022: \u20ac8 million) as part of the historical cost of property, plant and equipment.\n\n## (16) Companies Accounted for under the Equity Method and Other Financial Assets\n\nThe following table shows the structure of the companies accounted for under the equity method and the other financial assets as of the dates indicated:\n\n## Companies Accounted for under the Equity Method and Other Financial Assets\n\n|                                                 | December 31, 2023   | December 31, 2023   | December 31, 2023   | December 31, 2022   | December 31, 2022   | December 31, 2022   |\n|-------------------------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n| \u20ac in millions                                   | E.ON Group          | Associates 1        | Joint  Ventures 1   | E.ON Group          | Associates 1        | Joint  Ventures 1   |\n| Companies accounted for under the equity method | 6,653               | 2,923               | 3,730               | 5,532               | 2,596               | 2,936               |\n| Equity investments                              | 2,561               | 803                 | 296                 | 2,191               | 788                 | 256                 |\n| Non-current securities                          | 1,177               | -                   | -                   | 1,347               | -                   | -                   |\n| Total                                           | 10,391              | 3,726               | 4,026               | 9,070               | 3,384               | 3,192               |\n\nCompanies accounted for under the equity method consist solely of associates and joint ventures.\n\nThe \u20ac1,120 million increase in the carrying amounts of companies measured at equity compared with December 31, 2022, was mainly due to the increase in the carrying amount of the investment in Z\u00e1padoslovensk\u00e1 energetika a.s. (ZSE) in Slovakia and the application of IAS 29 in Turkey.\n\nThe net income from companies measured at equity of \u20ac478 million includes impairments of \u20ac237 (2022: \u20ac878 million) and reversals of impairment losses of \u20ac7 million (2022: \u20ac311 million).

Consequently, since the second quarter of 2022, the financial statements prepared on the basis of historical cost have been adjusted in accordance with IAS 29 for the first time for two Turkish investees included in the Group using the equity method (joint ventures). Under IAS 29, financial statements in the functional currency of a hyperinflationary economy must be expressed in terms of the measuring unit current at the balance sheet date. As a result, among other things, non-monetary assets and liabilities are generally adjusted using a general price index and a gain or loss on the net monetary position is recognized. The adjustment under IAS 29 is made on the basis of the consumer price index as of December 31, 2023, published by the Turkish Statistical Institute, which amounted to 1,859.38 index points (December 31, 2022: 1,128.45).\n\nThe transition effect as of January 1, 2022, amounted to \u20ac612 million (in foreign currency OCI), partially offset by a write-down in accumulated retained earnings (-\u20ac381 million).\n\nThe amount shown for non-current securities relates primarily to fixed-income securities.\n\nImpairments on other financial assets amounted to \u20ac63 million (2022: \u20ac30 million). Write-ups totaled \u20ac1 million (2022: \u20ac3 million).

(ZSE). Prior-year data may differ from the data published in the previous year due to subsequent findings. The Group adjustments at Enerjisa \u00dcretim Santralleri A.\u015e. are mainly the result of impairments recognized at the Group level in the reporting period and the previous year, respectively.\n\nThe material associates and the material joint ventures are active in diverse areas of the gas and electricity industries as well as telecommunications. Disclosures of company names, registered offices and equity interests as required by IFRS 12 for material joint arrangements and associates can be found in the list of shareholdings pursuant to Section 313 (2) HGB (see Note 38).\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, the investment in Enerjisa Enerji A.\u015e. is marketable. The pro rata market value amounted to \u20ac659 million as of December 31, 2023 (2022: \u20ac853 million). The carrying amount is \u20ac659 million as of December 31, 2023. The free float in the company totals 20 percent, with E.ON and Haci \u00d6mer Sabanci Holding A.\u015e. holding half of the remaining shares; from E.ON's perspective, Enerjisa Enerji A.\u015e. is therefore a joint venture.\n\nOf investments in companies accounted for under the equity method, the shareholdings in companies with a carrying amount of \u20ac709 million (2022: \u20ac702 million) are restricted because they were pledged as collateral for financing as of the balance sheet date.\n\nThere are no further material restrictions apart from those contained in standard legal and contractual provisions.",

In accordance with the decision of the Federal Constitutional Court, the legislator was required to remedy the violation of constitutional law by December 31, 2023, with retroactive effect. However, the legislator has not yet taken any action in this respect. Therefore, it is not currently clear how the legislator will structure the new regulation. Depending on how the new legislation is enacted, this could potentially result in a tax refund for E.ON SE in the future of up to a low, three-digit million euro amount in the context of ongoing appeal proceedings. Due to\n\nthe tight budgetary situation, however, it cannot be ruled out that the legislator will use its discretionary powers in a pro-fiscal manner.\n\n## (19) Liquid Funds\n\nThe following table provides a breakdown of liquid funds by original maturity as of the dates indicated:\n\n## Liquid Funds\n\n| \u20ac in millions                                                       | 2023   | 2022   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Securities and fixed-term deposits                                  | 1,375  | 1,600  |\n| Current securities with an original maturity  greater than 3 months | 1,375  | 1,600  |\n| Restricted liquid funds                                             | 452    | 452    |\n| Cash and cash equivalents                                           | 5,585  | 7,324  |\n| thereof subject to an only contractual  restriction                 | 33     | 351    |\n| Total                                                               | 7,412  | 9,376  |\n\nCash and cash equivalents include \u20ac5,096 million (2022: \u20ac6,001 million) in cash, checks, cash on hand and balances at financial institutions with an original maturity of less than three months.

The reduction in additional paid-in capital is attributable to the issue of employee shares to eligible employees of the E.ON Group.\n\n## (22) Retained Earnings\n\nThe following table breaks down the E.ON Group's retained earnings as of the dates indicated:\n\n## Retained Earnings\n\n|                         | December 31,   | December 31,   |\n|-------------------------|----------------|----------------|\n| \u20ac in millions           | 2023           | 2022           |\n| Legal reserves          | 45             | 45             |\n| Other retained earnings | 1,446          | 3,172          |\n| Total                   | 1,491          | 3,217          |\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, these IFRS retained earnings totaled \u20ac1,491 million (2022: \u20ac3,217 million). The total change of -\u20ac1,726 million is primarily due to E.ON SE's distribution to shareholders. In addition, actuarial losses from pensions led to a change in retained earnings. This was partially offset by the positive consolidated net income.\n\nUnder German securities law, E.ON SE shareholders may receive distributions from E.ON SE's income available for distribution in accordance with the German Commercial Code (German GAAP).\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, these German-GAAP retained earnings totaled \u20ac3,294 million (2022: \u20ac2,630 million). Of this amount, legal reserves of \u20ac45 million (2022: \u20ac45 million) are restricted pursuant to Section 150 (3) and (4) AktG. The increase in retained earnings is due to the transfer of \u20ac650 million to the revenue reserve from the current result, as well as the sale of treasury shares under the employee stock purchase program in 2023. In addition, amounts of \u20ac102.9 million (2022: \u20ac117.6 million) are restricted from distribution under German commercial law as a result of the surplus of plan assets and the difference between the recognition of provisions for retirement benefit obligations based on the corresponding average market interest rate over the past ten fiscal years and the recognition of these provisions based on the corresponding average market interest rate over the past seven fiscal years. The dividend-restricted amounts are fully covered by a sufficient amount of available reserves.\n\nThe amount of retained earnings available for distribution is \u20ac3,146 million (2022: \u20ac2,467 million).\n\nA proposal to distribute a cash dividend for 2023 of \u20ac0.53 per share will be submitted to the Annual Shareholders Meeting. For 2022, shareholders at the May 17, 2023, the Annual Shareholders Meeting voted to distribute a dividend of \u20ac0.51 for each dividendpaying ordinary share. Based on a \u20ac0.53 dividend, the total profit distribution is \u20ac1,384 million (2022: \u20ac1,331 million).\n\n## (23) Changes in Other Comprehensive Income\n\nThe change in other comprehensive income is primarily the result of exchange rate differences recognized on the balance sheet, indexation effects from the application of IAS 29 (hyperinflationary accounting) in Turkey, and the recognition of actuarial gains and losses.\n\nThe table below illustrates the share of OCI attributable to companies accounted for under the equity method.\n\n## Share of OCI Attributable to Companies Accounted for under the Equity Method\n\n| \u20ac in millions                            | 2023   | 2022   |\n|------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Balance as of December 31 (before taxes) | -412   | -889   |\n| Taxes                                    | -      | -      |\n| Balance as of December 31 (after taxes)  | -412   | -889   |",

Both defined benefit plans and defined contribution plans are in place at E.ON. Benefits under defined benefit plans are generally paid upon reaching retirement age, or in the event of disability or death.\n\nE.ON regularly reviews the pension plans in place within the Group for financial risks. Typical risk factors for defined benefit plans are longevity and changes in nominal interest rates, as well as inflation developments and rising wages and salaries.\n\nThe features and risks of defined benefit plans are shaped by the general legal, tax and regulatory conditions prevailing in the respective country. The configurations of the major defined benefit and defined contribution plans within the E.ON Group are described in the following discussion.\n\n## Germany\n\nActive employees at the German Group companies are covered by both cash balance plans and pension plans based on final salary. Pension plans based on final salary are closed to new hires. All new hires will receive cash balance plans in accordance with a capital or pension module system, which, depending on the pension plan, can provide for alternative payout options of a prorated single payment and payments of installments in addition to the payment of a regular pension. The cash balance plans used different interest rules until December 31, 2021. Depending on the underlying pension plan, either interest rates adjusted to market developments with a fixed lower limit or guaranteed interest rates were used to determine the capital or pension modules. The majority of pension commitments still with a fixed guaranteed interest rate were modified as of January 1, 2022, in that the pension modules acquired from January 1, 2022, onwards now also bear interest at a rate adjusted to market developments and\n\nprotected by a fixed lower limit. The benefit expense for the cash balance plans is determined at different percentage rates based on the ratio between compensation and the contribution limit in the statutory retirement pension system in Germany. Employees can additionally choose to defer compensation.\n\nFuture pension adjustments are either guaranteed at 1 percent per annum or largely track the development of the inflation rate, usually in a three-year cycle.\n\nTo fund the pension plans for the German Group companies, plan assets were established. The major part of these plan assets is administered in the form of Contractual Trust Arrangements ('CTAs') in accordance with specified investment principles. There are additional plan assets available through the implementation channels of the pension fund ('Pensionsfonds') and smaller German pension vehicles ('Pensions- und Unterst\u00fctzungskassen'). Only the pension fund and the 'Pensionskassen' vehicles are subject to regulatory provisions in relation to the investment of capital and funding requirements.\n\n## United Kingdom\n\nIn the United Kingdom, there are various pension plans. In the past, employees were covered by defined benefit plans, which for the most part were final-pay plans and make up the majority of the pension obligations currently reported for the United Kingdom. Benefit payments to the beneficiaries are adjusted for inflation on a limited basis. These pension plans were closed to new hires. Since then, new hires are offered a defined contribution plan. Aside from the payment of contributions, this plan entails no additional risks for the employer.\n\nPlan assets in the United Kingdom are administered by trustees in independent special-purpose vehicles, most of which are separate sections of the Electricity Supply Pension Scheme (ESPS). The trustees are selected by the members of the plan or appointed by the entity. In that capacity, the trustees are particularly responsible for the investment of the plan assets.",

The actuarial assumptions underlying the valuation are agreed upon by the trustees and E.ON UK plc. They include presumed life expectancy, wage and salary growth rates, investment returns, inflationary assumptions and interest rate levels.\n\nThe last technical valuation for the E.ON UK Section took place on the reporting date of March 31, 2021, and no technical funding deficit was identified. The most recent completed technical valuation carried out for the Npower section was completed as of March 31, 2022, and there was also no technical financing deficit identified.\n\n## Other Countries\n\nThe remaining pension obligations are divided between the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Sweden, Italy, Poland, Romania, the Czech Republic and the USA.\n\nThe defined benefit plan in the Netherlands consists of commitments made by various employers within the framework of a sector-specific fund and does not permit a pro rata allocation of the obligations, plan assets and service cost. The E.ON Group accordingly accounts for this obligation as a defined contribution plan. There are no minimum funding requirements in this respect. Benefits may be reduced or contributions increased if there is insufficient funding.\n\nFrom the perspective of the Group, however, the benefit plans are relatively insignificant in the above-mentioned countries.",

This investment policy stems from the corresponding governance guidelines of the Group. An increase in the net defined benefit liability or a deterioration in the funded status following an unfavorable development in plan assets or in the present value of the defined benefit obligations is identified in these guidelines as a risk. E.ON therefore regularly reviews the development of the funded status in order to monitor this risk.\n\nTo implement the investment objective, the E.ON Group primarily pursues an investment approach that takes into account the structure of the benefit obligations. This long-term investment\n\nstrategy seeks to manage the funded status, with the result that any changes in the defined benefit obligations, especially those caused by fluctuating inflation and interest rates are, to a certain degree, offset by simultaneous corresponding changes in the fair value of plan assets. The investment strategy may also involve the use of derivatives (for example, interest rate swaps and inflation swaps, as well as currency hedging instruments) to facilitate the control of specific risk factors of pension liabilities. In the table above, derivatives have been allocated, based on their substance, to the respective asset classes. In order to improve the funded status of the E.ON Group as a whole, a portion of the plan assets will also be invested in a diversified portfolio of asset classes that are expected to provide for long-term returns in excess of those of fixed-income investments and the discount rate.\n\nThe determination of the target portfolio structure for the individual plan assets is based on regular asset-liability studies. In these studies, the target portfolio structure is reviewed in a comprehensive approach against the backdrop of existing investment principles, the current funded status, the condition of the capital markets and the structure of the benefit obligations, and is adjusted as necessary. The parameters used in the studies are additionally reviewed regularly, at least once each year. Asset managers are tasked with implementing the target portfolio structure. They are monitored for target achievement on a regular basis.",

As in the prior year, E.ON assumes a 2 percent increase in costs when estimating annual payments. A change in the discount rate or in the cost increase rate of 0.1 percentage points would change the amount of the provision recognized on the balance sheet by approximately \u20ac40 million.\n\nExcluding the effects of discounting and cost increases, the amounts for disposal obligations would be \u20ac6,540 million with average credit terms of approximately six years.\n\nThere were changes in estimates for the nuclear power business in 2023 in the amount of \u20ac266 million (2022: -\u20ac965 million). This mainly includes the discounting effect in the amount of about \u20ac200 million resulting from the decrease in interest rates, effects from cost adjustments in the amount of \u20ac230 million and offsetting effects from the optimization of decommissioning and disposal services. \u20ac686 million (2022: \u20ac624 million) of this was used, of which \u20ac592 million (2022: \u20ac562 million) related to decommissioning nuclear power plants based on circumstances for which decommissioning and dismantling costs were capitalized.\n\n## Personnel Obligations\n\nProvisions for personnel costs primarily cover provisions for early retirement benefits, performance-based compensation components, restructuring and other deferred personnel costs. Restructuring provisions, which totaled \u20ac641 million at December 31, 2023 (2022: \u20ac766 million), were made especially in Germany for various restructuring projects.\n\n## Obligations from Green Certificates\n\nRenewables Obligation Certificates (ROCs or Green Certificates) are an important mechanism for promoting renewable energies, especially in the UK. The ROCs represent a fixed share of Renewables in power sales and can be acquired either from renewable sources or on the market. During a 12-month ROC period, the obligations recognized as a provision for this purpose are offset against the acquired certificates and used.",

In addition, the provisions for dismantling conventional plant components in the nuclear power segment, which are based on legally binding civil agreements and public provisions, in the amount of \u20ac375 million (2022: \u20ac300 million) are taken into account here. The change in this item is in addition to inflationrelated adjustments also due to the decrease in interest rates. Excluding discounting and cost-increase effects, the amounts for these disposal obligations with an average payment term of about 14 years would be \u20ac380 million.\n\nThe other asset retirement obligations disclosed under economic net debt, not including the provisions for dismantling conventional plant components in the nuclear power segment, amount to \u20ac447 million.\n\n## Sales and Supplier-Related Obligations\n\nProvisions for supplier-related obligations consist of provisions for potential losses on open purchase contracts.\n\nThe main changes in the area of sales-related obligations result from impending losses from pending sales contracts. There was a reversal in the amount of \u20ac1.9 billion in connection with the lower energy prices on the commodity markets. In addition \u20ac1.4 billion was utilized. Provisions for sales market-oriented obligations include provisions for risks of loss from pending sales agreements in the amount of \u20ac0.1 billion (2022: \u20ac3.2 billion).\n\n## Environmental Remediation and Similar Obligations\n\nProvisions for environmental remediation refer primarily to redevelopment protection measures and the rehabilitation of contaminated sites.\n\n## Other\n\nThe other miscellaneous provisions consist of certain environmental remediation obligations from predecessor companies in the amount of \u20ac0.3 billion (2022: \u20ac0.4 billion), possible obligations from tax-related interest expense in the amount of \u20ac0.1 billion (2022: \u20ac0.1 billion) and litigation cost risks in the amount of \u20ac0.1 billion (2022: \u20ac0.1 billion).",

E.ON can use this collateral without restriction.\n\nThe financial liabilities of innogy recognized at the date of initial consolidation were marked to market under IFRS. This market value was considerably higher than the nominal value because market interest rates had fallen since the bonds were issued. The difference between the nominal value and the market value calculated during the purchase price allocation totaled \u20ac1,496 million as of December 31, 2023 (as of December 31, 2022: \u20ac1,668 million) and will be reversed over the term of each bond and recognized as an expense in the financial result (see Note 10). This difference is not taken into account in the economic net debt.",

As of December 31, 2023, there were bilateral credit facilities in the amount of about \u20ac2.3 billion (2022: \u20ac4.0 billion), with original maturities of up to 1.5 years. These facilities were agreed with a share of E.ON's core banking group and were not drawn on during the reporting year.\n\n## \u20ac3.5 Billion Syndicated Revolving Credit Facility\n\nEffective October 24, 2019, E.ON arranged a syndicated revolving credit facility in the amount of \u20ac3.5 billion over an original term of five years, with two extension options for one year each. After\n\nboth options are exercised, the term of the credit line will end on October 24, 2026. The credit margin is linked, among other things, to the development of certain ESG ratings, which gives E.ON financial incentives to pursue a sustainable corporate strategy. The ESG ratings are set by three prominent agencies: ISS ESG, MSCI ESG Research, and Sustainalytics. The facility serves as the Group's reliable, long-term liquidity reserve, one purpose of which is to function as a backup facility for the commercial paper programs. The facility was granted by 21 banks, which make up E.ON's core banking group. The facility has not been drawn in the reporting year.\n\n## \u20ac10 Billion and $10 Billion Commercial Paper Programs\n\nThe euro commercial paper program in the amount of \u20ac10 billion allows E.ON SE to issue from time to time commercial paper with maturities of up to two years less one day to investors. The US commercial paper program in the amount of $10 billion allows E.ON SE to issue from time to time commercial paper with maturities of up to 366 days to investors. As of December 31, 2023, \u20ac44 million was outstanding under the euro commercial paper program (2022: \u20ac364 million) and the equivalent of \u20ac170 million (prior year: \u20ac403 million) under the US commercial paper program.",

As in the prior year, the majority of these were government grants, in particular for the network business. The E.ON Group retains ownership of the assets. The grants are non-refundable and are recognized in other operating income over the period of the depreciable lives of the related assets.\n\nDerivative liabilities totaled \u20ac12,440 million as of December 31, 2023 (2022: \u20ac28,009 million). Of this amount, \u20ac10,832 million (2022: \u20ac26,316 million) is attributable to forward commodity contracts. The change compared with the previous year is mainly due to the market valuation of commodity derivatives.\n\nContract liabilities under IFRS 15 in the amount of \u20ac4,392 million (2022: \u20ac4,098 million) consist primarily of construction grants that were paid by customers for the cost of new gas and electricity connections in accordance with the generally binding terms governing such new connections. These grants are customary in the industry, generally non-refundable and recognized as revenue in the amount of \u20ac314 million according to the useful lives of the related assets (2022: \u20ac372 million).\n\nOther operating liabilities consist primarily of other tax liabilities in the amount of \u20ac950 million (2022: \u20ac1,019 million) and interest payable in the amount of \u20ac441 million (2022: \u20ac369 million). This item also includes other liabilities to our customers from overpayments and refund claims of \u20ac1,765 million (2022: \u20ac902 million) and current personnel liabilities of \u20ac503 million (2022: \u20ac458 million). Also included in other operating liabilities are carryforwards of counterparty obligations to acquire additional shares in already consolidated subsidiaries as well as noncontrolling interests in fully consolidated partnerships with legal\n\nstructures that give their shareholders a statutory right of withdrawal combined with a compensation claim, in the amount of \u20ac563 million (2022: \u20ac555 million).\n\n## (28) Contingent Liabilities and Other Financial Obligations\n\nAs part of its business activities, E.ON is subject to contingent liabilities and other financial obligations involving a variety of underlying matters. These primarily include guarantees, obligations from litigation and claims (as discussed in more detail in Note 29), short- and long-term contractual, legal and other obligations and commitments.\n\n## Contingent Liabilities\n\nThe contingent liabilities of the E.ON Group amounted to \u20ac0.3 billion as of December 31, 2023 (December 31, 2022: \u20ac0.3 billion) and primarily include contingent liabilities in connection with potential long-term environmental remediation measures and legal disputes. This value represents the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation as of the reporting date.\n\nE.ON has also issued direct and indirect guarantees and surety bonds to third parties in connection with its own operations or the operations of affiliated companies, which may trigger payment obligations based on the occurrence of certain events. These instruments include both financial guarantees as well as operational guarantees, which primarily secure contractual obligations as well as benefit obligations for active and former employees.\n\nIn addition, E.ON has entered into indemnification agreements, which as a rule are incorporated in agreements concerning the disposal of shareholdings and, above all, affect the customary\n\nrepresentations and warranties with relation to liability risks for environmental damage and contingent tax risks. In some cases, obligations are covered in the first instance by provisions of the disposed companies before E.ON itself is required to make any payments. Guarantees issued by companies that were later sold by E.ON SE or its legal predecessors are usually included in the respective final sales contracts in the form of indemnities.\n\nMoreover, E.ON has commitments under which it assumes joint and several liability arising from its interests in civil-law companies ('GbR'), non-corporate commercial partnerships and consortia in which it participates.\n\nThe guarantees of E.ON also include items related to the operation of nuclear power plants. Under the German Nuclear Energy Act ('Atomgesetz' or 'AtG') and the ordinance regulating the provision for coverage under the Atomgesetz ('Atomrechtliche Deckungsvorsorge-Verordnung' or 'AtDeckV') of April 27, 2002, German nuclear power plant operators are required to provide nuclear accident liability coverage of up to \u20ac2.5 billion per incident.\n\nThe coverage requirement is satisfied in part by a standardized insurance facility in the amount of \u20ac255.6 million. The institution Nuklear Haftpflicht Gesellschaft b\u00fcrgerlichen Rechts ('Nuklear Haftpflicht GbR') now only covers costs between \u20ac0.5 million and \u20ac15 million for claims related to officially ordered evacuation measures. Group companies have agreed to place their subsidiaries operating nuclear power plants in a position to maintain a level of liquidity that will enable them at all times to meet their obligations as members of the Nuklear Haftpflicht GbR, in proportion to their shareholdings in nuclear power plants.\n\nTo provide liability coverage for the additional \u20ac2,244.4 million per incident required by the above-mentioned amendments, E.ON Energie AG ('E.ON Energie') and the other parent companies of German nuclear power plant operators reached a Solidarity Agreement ('Solidarvereinbarung') on July 11, July 27, August 21, and August 28, 2001, extended by agreement dated March 25,",

If an accident occurs, the Solidarity Agreement calls for the nuclear power plant operator liable for the damages to receive-after the operator's own resources and those of its parent companies are exhausted-financing sufficient for the operator to meet its financial obligations. Under the Solidarity Agreement, E.ON Energie's share of the liability coverage on December 31, 2023, was 43.3 percent (prior year: 43.3 percent), plus an additional 5.0 percent charge for the administrative costs of processing damage claims. The contract does not provide for a change in share for the 2023 calendar year. Sufficient liquidity has been provided for and is included within the liquidity plan.\n\nFurthermore, as of December 31, 2023, E.ON is continuing to provide collateral in the amount of \u20ac454.2 million (2022: \u20ac700.8 million) for the former Group companies transferred to RWE which are to be repaid or assumed by RWE Group companies. In the course of the fiscal year 2023, \u20ac246.6 million of guarantees were redeemed as part of the exchange process with RWE.\n\n## Other Financial Obligations\n\nIn addition to provisions and liabilities carried on the balance sheet and to reported contingent liabilities, there also are other financial obligations arising mainly from contracts entered into with third parties, or on the basis of legal requirements.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, purchase commitments for investments in property, plant and equipment amounted to \u20ac2.9 billion (2022: \u20ac2.3 billion). Of these commitments, \u20ac2.4 billion are due within one year (2022: \u20ac1.7 billion). \u20ac2.3 billion of the purchase commitment at December 31, 2023 (2022: \u20ac2.0 billion) relates to the segments Energy Networks Germany and Sweden.\n\nAdditional contractual obligations in place at the E.ON Group as of December 31, 2023, relate primarily to the purchase of electricity and natural gas. Fixed financial obligations under electricity\n\npurchase contracts amount to \u20ac6.7 billion on December 31, 2023 (2022: \u20ac11.3 billion), of which \u20ac5.0 billion (2022: \u20ac8.6 billion) is due within one year. Financial obligations under fixed gas purchase contracts amount to approximately \u20ac3.9 billion on December 31, 2023 (2022: \u20ac5.4 billion). Of this amount, \u20ac2.8 billion (2022: \u20ac4.5 billion) is due within one year. Additional fixed purchase commitments as of December 31, 2023, amount to \u20ac0.8 billion (2022: \u20ac0.7 billion). They essentially include long-term contractual commitments to purchase heat and alternative fuels. Of these commitments, \u20ac0.2 billion (2022: \u20ac0.2 billion) are due within one year. There are also additional purchase commitments whose amount is not fixed yet.\n\nOther financial obligations exist only to an insignificant extent. These include capital commitments in connection with joint ventures, obligations concerning the acquisition of financial assets, and obligations arising from capital measures.\n\n## (29) Litigation and Claims\n\nA number of different court actions, governmental investigations and proceedings, and other claims are currently pending or may be instituted or asserted in the future against companies of the E.ON Group. This in particular includes an increased number of legal actions and proceedings relating to contract amendments and price adjustments initiated in response to market upheavals and the changed economic and geopolitical situation in the electricity, gas and heat sectors (also as a consequence of the energy transition and the energy crisis) and concerning price increases and anticompetitive practices. The courts and authorities are also subjecting competitive practices to stricter reviews. Where appropriate, Group companies have recognized corresponding contingent assets (see Note 18), provisions (see Note 26) or contingent liabilities (see Note 28).\n\nIn the Energy Networks segment, Group companies are involved in proceedings for the award of concessions and in connection with\n\ngrid connections and the calculation of the grid fee. Official regulations, approvals and changes in regulatory practice have given rise to legal disputes. Of particular note here are effects in connection with the regulatory treatment of capital costs, return on equity and other key regulatory parameters. The national legal framework conditions within Europe are subject to changes, some of which have a significant impact on network operations. Owing to a number of factors, including regulatory and legal decisions, the regulatory framework has increased here. However, these regulatory interventions are not restricted to the network area; distribution activities in the customer solutions area have also been affected by regulatory measures.\n\nThe changes to the legal and regulatory framework can in some cases also significantly impact subsidies and remuneration practices in the area of Renewables, which in turn are the object of regulatory or court proceedings.\n\nThere are also legal disputes in connection with completed M&A activities, in particular as a result of the acquisition of innogy SE. With regard to the latter, all legal actions brought against the European Commission's merger control approval decision were dismissed by the Court of First Instance of the European Union; E.ON SE intervened on the side of the European Commission in these proceedings.\n\n## (30) Supplemental Cash Flow Disclosures\n\nPlease refer to the detailed presentation in Note 5 for information on the shares in AggerEnergie GmbH and other shares in Z\u00e1padoslovensk\u00e1 energetika a.s. ('ZSE') acquired in the framework of swap transactions.\n\nIn the current fiscal year, E.ON made external payments for additions to consolidated shareholdings and activities in the amount of \u20ac14 million (2022: \u20ac0 million). Cash and cash equivalents in the amount of \u20ac2 million were also acquired. The",

Cash and cash equivalents disposed of amounted to \u20ac0 million (2022: \u20ac3 million). The sale of the consolidated activities led to reductions of \u20ac1 million (2022: \u20ac855 million) in assets and \u20ac1 million (2022: \u20ac55 million) in provisions and liabilities.\n\nCash provided by operating activities of continuing operations before interest and taxes of \u20ac7.2 billion was \u20ac4.3 billion below the prior-year figure (\u20ac11.5 billion). This resulted in part from a decline of \u20ac0.9 billion at Energy Networks, which is mainly attributable to adverse changes in working capital at the network business in Germany. In particular, back payments to energy feed-in customers who had received insufficient instalment payments in the previous year had a negative impact on operating cash flow in the year under review. The remaining decline (a total of -\u20ac3.4 billion) came from Customer Solutions and Corporate Functions/Other and was likewise mainly due to negative changes in working capital in the 2023 financial year that more than offset the increase in cash-effective earnings. These negative changes in working capital are mainly attributable to the timing difference between customer instalment payments already received in 2022 and payments from government support measures and the related cash outflows from commodity procurement in the year under review. In addition, the closure of E.ON's last nuclear power plant in the 2023 financial year led to a further deterioration of cash provided by operating activities relative to the prior year.\n\nCash provided by investing activities of continuing operations of -\u20ac5.6 billion was 2.4 billion below the prior-year figure of -\u20ac3.2 billion. This includes cash-effective investments of \u20ac6.4 billion (prior year: \u20ac4.8 billion). The increase is primarily attributable to the planned increase in investments in property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, particularly at the\n\nnetwork business Germany. A reduction in cash inflow from disposals also affected cash provided by investment activities. There was no transaction in the 2023 financial year comparable to the sale of E.ON's 50-percent stake in Westconnect in the prior year.\n\nCash provided by financing activities of continuing operations of -\u20ac1.8 billion was \u20ac1.3 billion above the prior-year figure of -\u20ac3.1 billion. The net of the issuance and repayment of bonds, commercial paper, and bank liabilities led to an improvement in cash provided by financing activities. A net reduction in adverse effects in conjunction with variation margins due to the settlement of derivative transactions led to a further improvement in cash provided by financing activities.\n\n## Supplemental Information on Cash Flows from Operating Activities\n\n| \u20ac in millions                    | 2023   | 2022   |\n|----------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Income taxes paid (less refunds) | -716   | -594   |\n| Interest paid                    | -1,203 | -1,091 |\n| Interest received                | 348    | 219    |\n| Dividends received               | 571    | 575    |",

E.ON also hedges net investments in foreign operations.\n\nIn the commodity sector, fluctuations in future cash flows from procurement and sales transactions are economically hedged by offsetting transactions. Hedge accounting was applied in individual cases with regard to hedging electricity and gas price change risks.\n\nTo hedge currency risk, E.ON entered into hedging transactions in the reporting year in pounds sterling at an average hedging rate of \u00a30.90/\u20ac (2022: \u00a30. 91/\u20ac) and in US dollars at an average hedging rate of US$1.36/\u20ac (2022: US$1.36/\u20ac). Hedging transactions were concluded at an average interest rate of 2.80 percent (2022: 2.67 percent) to hedge the interest rate risk in the eurozone. To hedge commodity price risk, E.ON entered into hedging transactions with an average hedged price of \u20ac30/MWh for gas and an average hedged price of \u20ac115/MWh for electricity.\n\n## Fair Value Hedges\n\nFair value hedges are used to protect against the risk from changes in market values. Gains and losses on these hedges are generally reported in that line item of the income statement which also includes the respective hedged items.\n\n## Cash Flow Hedges\n\nCash flow hedges are used to protect against the risk arising from variable cash flows. Interest rate swaps and cross-currency interest rate swaps are the principal instruments used to limit interest rate and currency risks. The purpose of these swaps is to\n\nmaintain the level of payments arising from long-term interestbearing receivables and liabilities denominated in foreign currency and euros by using cash flow hedge accounting in the functional currency of the respective E.ON company. Futures contracts are concluded to reduce future cash flow fluctuations arising from commodity transactions effected at variable spot prices. Cash flow hedge accounting to hedge the risk of changes in commodity prices (electricity and gas) was applied in individual cases in the 2023 fiscal year. The following table presents the carrying amounts of the hedging instruments and the changes in the fair values of the hedging instruments and hedged items by hedged risk type:\n\n## Carrying Amounts of Hedging Instruments and Changes in Fair Value of Hedging Instruments and Hedged Items in Connection with Cash Flow Hedges\n\n|                              | Carrying amount             | Carrying amount             | Carrying amount                                    | Carrying amount                                    | Carrying amount                                                | Carrying amount                                                | Carrying amount                           | Carrying amount                           |\n|------------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|\n|                              | Receivables from derivative | Receivables from derivative | Liabilities from derivative  financial instruments | Liabilities from derivative  financial instruments | Change in the fair value of the  designated portion of hedging | Change in the fair value of the  designated portion of hedging | Change in the fair value of  hedged items | Change in the fair value of  hedged items |\n| \u20ac in millions                | 2023                        | 2022                        | 2023                                               | 2022                                               | 2023                                                           | 2022                                                           | 2023                                      | 2022                                      |\n| Currency risk                | 325                         | 408                         | 165                                                | 107                                                | -141                                                           | 100                                                            | 140                                       | -99                                       |\n| Interest-rate risk           | 1                           | 66                          | 327                                                | 465                                                | 72                                                             | 816                                                            | 7                                         | -827                                      |\n| Commodity price change  risk | 0                           | -                           | 3                                                  | -                                                  | -3                                                             | 676                                                            | 520                                       | -676                                      |\n\nThe total amount of ineffectiveness for cash flow hedges recorded for the year ended December 31, 2023, produced income of \u20ac6 million (2022: income of \u20ac3 million) resulting from exchange rate hedging.\n\nGains and losses from the ineffective portions of cash flow hedges are classified as other operating income or other operating expenses.",

The fair values of the designated portion of the hedging instruments changed by -\u20ac110 million in the reporting period (2022: +\u20ac304 million).\n\nAs in 2022, no ineffectiveness resulted from net investment hedges in 2023.\n\nThe development of OCI arising from net investment hedges is as follows:\n\n## Changes in OCI Arising from Net Investment Hedges\n\n| \u20ac in millions                                     | Currency risk   |\n|---------------------------------------------------|-----------------|\n| Balance as of January 1, 2022                     | 220             |\n| Unrealized changes-hedging reserve                | 322             |\n| Unrealized changes-reserve for hedging costs      | -18             |\n| Reclassification adjustments recognized in income | -               |\n| Change in scope of consolidation                  | -               |\n| Income taxes                                      | -170            |\n| Balance as of December 31, 2022 1                 | 354             |\n| Balance as of January 1, 2023                     | 354             |\n| Unrealized changes-hedging reserve                | -113            |\n| Unrealized changes-reserve for hedging costs      | 2               |\n| Reclassification adjustments recognized in income | -               |\n| Change in scope of consolidation                  | -               |\n| Income taxes                                      | 23              |\n| Balance as of December 31, 2023 1                 | 266             |\n\n1 As of December 31, 2023, includes -\u20ac71 million (2022: -\u20ac71 million) from terminated net investment hedges.\n\nAs a rule, reclassification adjustments recognized in income are reported under other operating income and expenses. The nominal volume of hedging instruments in net investment hedges amounted to \u20ac4,613 million as of December 31, 2023 (2022: \u20ac4,759 million). Since the currency risk of net investment hedges is hedged through the ongoing rollover of the hedging instruments, the majority are concluded with a remaining term of less than one year.\n\n## Valuation of Derivative Instruments\n\nThe fair value of derivative financial instruments is sensitive to movements in underlying market rates and other relevant variables. The Company assesses and monitors the fair value of derivative instruments on a periodic basis. The fair value to be determined for each derivative instrument is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date (exit price). E.ON also takes into account the counterparty credit risk for both own credit risk (debt value adjustment) and the risk of the corresponding counterparty (credit value adjustment) when determining fair value. The fair values of derivative instruments are calculated using common market valuation methods with reference to available market data on the measurement date.\n\nThe following is a summary of the methods and assumptions for the valuation of utilized derivative financial instruments in the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n- \u00b7 Currency, electricity and gas forward contracts, swaps, and emissions-related derivatives are valued separately at their forward rates and prices as of the balance sheet date. Whenever possible, forward rates and prices are based on market quotations, with any applicable forward premiums and discounts taken into consideration.",

Discounted cash values are determined for interest rate, currency and cross-currency interest rate swaps for each individual transaction as of the balance sheet date. Interest income and expenses are recognized in income at the date of payment or accrual.\n- \u00b7 Equity forwards are valued on the basis of the stock prices of the underlying equities, taking into consideration any timing components.\n- \u00b7 Exchange-traded futures and option contracts are valued individually at daily settlement prices determined on the futures markets that are published by their respective clearing houses. Paid initial margins are disclosed under other assets. Variation margins received or paid during the term of such contracts are stated under other liabilities or other assets, respectively, unless they are offset against the recognized market values of the commodity derivatives, as the offsetting criteria of IAS 32.42 are met.\n- \u00b7 Certain long-term energy contracts are valued with the aid of valuation models that use internal data if market prices are not available. A hypothetical 10 percent increase or decrease in these internal valuation parameters as of the balance sheet date would lead to a theoretical change in market values of \u00b1\u20ac5 million.\n\n## (32) Additional Disclosures on Financial Instruments\n\nThe carrying amounts of the financial instruments, their grouping into IFRS 9 measurement categories, their fair values and their measurement sources by class are presented in the following table:",

Any necessary discounting takes place using current market interest rates over the remaining terms of the financial instruments. The determination of the fair value of derivative financial instruments is discussed in Note 31.\n\nAt the end of each reporting period, E.ON assesses whether there might be grounds for reclassification between hierarchy levels. In 2023, due to adjusted price quotes, securities with a fair value of \u20ac169 million were reclassified from hierarchy level 1 to hierarchy\n\nlevel 2 and securities with a fair value of \u20ac283 million were reclassified from hierarchy level 2 to hierarchy level 1.\n\nThe input parameters of Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy for equity investments are specified taking into account economic developments and available industry and corporate data (see also Note 1). A hypothetical change of +10 percent or -10 percent in these key internal valuation parameters as of the balance sheet date would lead to a theoretical change in market values of +\u20ac77 million or -\u20ac3 million, respectively. Certain long-term energy contracts are measured using valuation models based on internal fundamental data if market prices are not available.\n\nA hypothetical change of \u00b110 percent in the internal valuation parameters as of the balance sheet date would result in a theoretical increase or decrease in fair values of \u00b1\u20ac5 million. A change of +10 percent or -10 percent in the key internal measurement parameters of other financial receivables and other financial assets as of the balance sheet date would result in a theoretical increase or decrease in fair values of \u00b1\u20ac2 million. The fair values determined using valuation techniques for financial instruments carried at fair value are reconciled as shown in the following table:\n\n## Fair Value Hierarchy Level 3 Reconciliation\n\n|                                                  |              |                                   |                               |             |                                    | Transfers     | Transfers       |                            |               |\n|--------------------------------------------------|--------------|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------|------------------------------------|---------------|-----------------|----------------------------|---------------|\n| \u20ac in millions                                    | Jan. 1, 2023 | Purchases  (including  additions) | Sales  (including  disposals) | Settlements | Gains/losses  in income  statement | into  Level 3 | out of  Level 3 | Exchange rate  differences | Dec. 31, 2023 |\n| Equity investments                               | 388          | 93                                | 1                             | -           | -44                                | -             | -               | -2                         | 436           |\n| Derivative financial instruments                 | -398         | -69                               | 447                           | -           | 2                                  | -             | -               | -                          | -18           |\n| Financial receivables and other financial assets | 102          | -                                 | -                             | -11         | 10                                 | -             | -               | -                          | 101           |\n| Total                                            | 92           | 24                                | 448                           | -11         | -32                                | -             | -               | -2                         | 519           |",

If there is also currently a legal right to set off and the intention is to settle on a net basis, offsetting is mandatory in accordance with IAS 32.\n\nThe netting agreements are derived from netting clauses contained in master agreements including those of the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA), the German Master Agreement for Financial Derivatives Transactions (DRV), the European Federation of Energy Traders (EFET) and the Financial Energy Master Agreement (FEMA).\n\nCollateral pledged to and received from financial institutions in relation to these liabilities and assets limits the utilization of credit lines in the fair value measurement of interest rate and currency derivatives, and is shown in the table.\n\n## Netting Agreements for Financial Assets and Liabilities as of December 31, 2023\n\n| \u20ac in millions                          | Gross amount   | Amount offset   | Carrying  amount   | Conditional  netting  amount  (netting  agreements)   | Financial  collateral  received/  pledged   | Net value   |\n|----------------------------------------|----------------|-----------------|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|-------------|\n| Financial assets                       |                |                 |                    |                                                       |                                             |             |\n| Trade receivables                      | 14,172         | 3,912           | 10,260             | 192                                                   | 6                                           | 10,062      |\n| Commodity derivatives                  | 6,712          | 3               | 6,709              | 4,049                                                 | -

This amount is the maximum amount that E.ON would have to pay in the event of claims on the guarantees. E.ON has recognized a liability for this in the amount of \u20ac8 million (2022: \u20ac8 million).\n\nFor financial liabilities that bear floating interest rates, the rates that were fixed on the balance sheet date are used to calculate future interest payments for subsequent periods as well. Financial liabilities that can be terminated at any time are assigned to the earliest maturity band in the same way as put options that are exercisable at any time.\n\nIn gross-settled derivatives (usually currency derivatives and commodity derivatives), outflows are accompanied by related inflows of funds or commodities.\n\nThe net gains and losses from financial instruments by IFRS 9 category are shown in the following table:\n\n## Net Gains and Losses by Category\n\n| \u20ac in millions                        | 2023    | 2022   |\n|--------------------------------------|---------|--------|\n| Financial assets Amortized Cost      | -748    | -310   |\n| Financial liabilities Amortized Cost | -899    | -512   |\n| Fair Value through P&L               | -15,810 | 3,438  |\n| Fair Value through OCI               | 52      | -5     |\n| Total                                | -17,405 | 2,611  |\n\nThe net result of the category fair value through OCI results in particular from currency translation effects, interest results and income from the sale of fair value through OCI securities in the amount of \u20ac33 million (2022: \u20ac12 million).\n\nIn addition to impairments of financial assets, net gains and losses in the amortized cost category are due primarily to interest income from financial assets and liabilities and effects from the currency translation of financial liabilities.\n\nThe net gains and losses in the fair value through profit or loss measurement category encompass both the changes in fair value from derivative financial instruments and from equity instruments, and gains and losses on realization. The decrease in net results was due in particular to reduced income from the valuation and realization of commodity derivatives.\n\n## Impairments of Financial Assets\n\nImpairment losses on financial assets must be recognized not only for losses already incurred but also for expected future credit losses. E.ON takes into account expected future credit losses of financial assets carried at amortized cost, financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income, and receivables from finance leases.\n\nFor trade receivables, expected credit losses are recognized over their entire residual term using the simplified method (lifetime expected credit loss (ECL) trade receivables). For other financial assets, E.ON first determines the credit loss expected within the first 12 months (stage 1-12 month ECL). In derogation of this, in the event of a significant increase in the default risk, the expected credit loss over the entire residual term of the respective instrument is recognized (stage 2-lifetime ECL). Whether the default risk has increased significantly depends largely on the counterparty risk as calculated internally on initial recognition. E.ON uses an 18-point internal rating scale to monitor counterparty risk. A significant increase in the default risk is assumed at the earliest after a three-level decline in the rating (since initial recognition). If there are objective indications of an actual default, an individual impairment loss must be recognized on the income statement (stage 3-losses already incurred).\n\nE.ON distinguishes between two approaches when calculating expected future credit losses. If external or internal rating information is available, the expected credit loss for trade receivables and other financial assets is determined on the basis of this data. If no rating information is available, E.ON determines default ratios for trade receivables on the basis of historical default rates, taking into account forward-looking information on economic developments. In the E.ON Group, a default or the classification of a receivable as uncollectable is assumed after 180, 270 or 360 days, depending on the region.\n\nIn 2023, valuation allowances for trade receivables changed as shown in the following table:\n\n## Valuation Allowances for Trade Receivables\n\n| \u20ac in millions             | 2023   | 2022   |\n|---------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Balance as of January 1   | -1,612 | -1,253 |\n| Disposals                 | 121    | 259    |\n| Impairments               | -983   | -657   |\n| Other 1                   | -17    | 39     |\n| Balance as of December 31 | -2,491 | -1,612 |\n\n1 The item \"Other\" includes currency translation differences.\n\nThere were no significant changes in valuation allowances in 2023 for other financial assets measured at amortized cost or at fair value through other comprehensive income, or for receivables from finance leases.",

The units have developed additional guidelines of their own within the confines of the Group's overall guidelines. To ensure efficient risk management at the E.ON Group, the Trading (Front Office), Finance Controlling (Middle Office) and Financial Settlement (Back Office) departments are organized as strictly separate units. Risk steering and reporting in the areas of interest rates, currencies and credit for banks and liquidity management is performed by the Finance Controlling department (in the credit area, also in part by Counterparty Risk Management), while risk steering and reporting in the area of commodities and in the credit area for industrial enterprises is performed at Group level by a separate department.\n\nE.ON uses a Group-wide treasury, risk management and reporting system. This system is a standard information technology solution that is fully integrated and is continuously updated. The system is designed to provide for the analysis and monitoring of the E.ON Group's exposure to liquidity, foreign exchange and interest risks. On a Group-wide basis, Finance Controlling/Counterparty Risk Management monitors and steers credit risks for banks, and Counterparty Risk Management monitors and steers corporates of a certain materiality. These activities are carried out each using a standard software package.\n\nSeparate Risk Committees/Steering Groups are responsible for the maintenance and further development of the strategy set by the Management Board of E.ON SE with regard to commodity, treasury and credit risk management policies.\n\n## 1. Liquidity Management\n\nThe primary objectives of liquidity management at E.ON consist of ensuring the ability to pay at all times, the timely satisfaction of",

Funds are provided to the other Group companies as needed on the basis of an 'in-house banking' solution.\n\nE.ON SE determines the Group's financing requirements on the basis of short- and medium-term liquidity planning. The financing of the Group is controlled and implemented on a forward-looking basis in accordance with the planned liquidity requirement or surplus. Relevant planning factors taken into consideration include operating cash flow, capital expenditures, divestments, margin payments and the maturity of bonds and commercial paper.\n\n## 2. Price Risks\n\nIn the normal course of business, the E.ON Group is exposed to risks arising from price changes in foreign exchange, interest rates, commodities and asset management. These risks create volatility in earnings, equity, debt and cash flows from period to period. E.ON has developed a variety of strategies to limit or eliminate these risks, including the use of derivative financial instruments, among others.\n\n## 3. Credit Risks\n\nE.ON is exposed to credit risk in its operating activities and through the use of financial instruments. Uniform credit risk management procedures are in place throughout the Group to identify, measure and steer credit risks.\n\nThe following discussion of E.ON's risk management activities and the estimated amounts generated from value-at-risk ('VaR') and sensitivity analyses are 'forward-looking statements' that involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those projected due to actual, unforeseeable developments in the global financial markets. The methods used by the Company to analyze risks should not be considered forecasts of future events\n\nor losses. For example, E.ON faces certain risks that are either nonfinancial or non-quantifiable. Such risks principally include country risk, operational risk, regulatory risk and legal risk, which are not represented in the following analyses.\n\n## Foreign Exchange Risk Management\n\nE.ON SE is responsible for steering the currency risks to which the E.ON Group is exposed.\n\nBecause it holds interests in businesses outside of the eurozone, currency translation risks arise within the E.ON Group. Fluctuations in exchange rates produce accounting effects attributable to the translation of the balance sheet and income statement items of the foreign consolidated Group companies included in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Translation risks are hedged through borrowing in the corresponding local currency, which may also include shareholder loans in foreign currency. In addition, derivative and non-derivative financial instruments are employed as needed. The hedges qualify for hedge accounting under IFRS as hedges of net investments in foreign operations. The Group's translation risks are reviewed at regular intervals and the level of hedging is adjusted whenever necessary. The respective debt factor, net assets and the enterprise value denominated in the foreign currency are the principal criteria governing the level of hedging.\n\nThe E.ON Group is also exposed to operating and financial transaction risks attributable to foreign currency transactions. The subsidiaries are responsible for managing their operating currency risks and are generally required to hedge their currency risks through E.ON SE. E.ON SE coordinates hedging throughout the Group companies and makes use of external derivatives as needed. It may either directly close out foreign currency positions that have been tendered, in whole or in part, through external transactions, or keep the position open within approved limits. The one-day value-at-risk (95 percent confidence) for transactional foreign currency positions totaled \u20ac0.2 million as of December 31, 2023\n\n(2022: \u20ac0.7 million) and is mainly determined by the currencies Czech koruna, Hungarian forint and Swedish krona.\n\nFinancial transaction risks result from payments originating from financial receivables and payables. They are generated both by external financing in a variety of foreign currencies, and by shareholder loans from within the Group denominated in foreign currency. Financial transaction risks are generally hedged.\n\n## Interest Rate Risk Management\n\nE.ON is exposed to profit risks arising from floating-rate financial liabilities and future (re)financing needs. Positions based on fixed interest rates, on the other hand, are subject to changes in fair value resulting from the volatility of market interest rates. E.ON seeks a balanced maturity profile. This is influenced, among other factors, by the type of business model, existing liabilities as well as the regulatory framework in which E.ON operates. Interest rate derivatives are also used to manage interest rate risk.\n\nWith interest rate derivatives and cash on hand included, the share of financial liabilities with floating interest rates or with maturities of less than 12 months was 0 percent as of December 31, 2023 (2022: 0 percent). The volume-weighted average interest rate of the financial liabilities, including interest rate derivatives, was 2.8 percent as of December 31, 2023 (2022: 2.7 percent).\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, the E.ON Group held interest rate derivatives with a nominal value of \u20ac5,512 million (2022: \u20ac6,263 million).\n\nA sensitivity analysis was performed on the Group's floating-rate borrowings and planned financing, including interest risk hedges. This measure is used for internal risk controlling and reflects the economic position of the E.ON Group. A one-percentage-point upward or downward change in interest rates (across all currencies) would raise or lower interest charges by \u00b1\u20ac15 million (2022: \u00b1\u20ac8.0 million) in the subsequent fiscal year.",

The principal commodity prices to which E.ON is exposed relate, in particular, to electricity, gas, green and emissions certificates.\n\nThe objective of commodity risk management is to transact through physical and financial contracts to optimize the value of the portfolio while reducing the potential negative deviation from target EBITDA and OCF.\n\nIn the normal course of business of the underlying energy production and retail sales activities, E.ON's individual management units are exposed to uncertain commodity market prices, which impacts operating results. All external trading on commodity markets contributes to reducing open commodity positions driven by sales and is undertaken in strict accordance with approved commodity hedging strategies.\n\nA very small number of proprietary trading transactions are entered into in separate trading books, which are subject to strict monitoring and limits based on risk metrics and governance. The processes and operational management models within the trading system are monitored by the local market risk teams and centrally managed by the Risk Management department.\n\nThe subsidiary, E.ON Energy Markets GmbH (EEM), acts as a central interface to the wholesale markets. The main function of EEM is to consolidate E.ON's commodity positions, to reduce price risks from the distribution business and to diversify and reduce credit and margin risks.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, the E.ON Group primarily held electricity and gas derivatives with a nominal value of \u20ac125,767 million (2022: \u20ac136,765 million). Electricity derivatives account for \u20ac45,418 million (2022: \u20ac66,648 million) of this amount and gas derivatives for \u20ac80,268 million (2022: \u20ac70,055 million).\n\nA key foundation of the commodity risk management system is the Group-wide Commodity Risk Policy and the corresponding internal policies of the units. These specify the control principles for commodity risk management, minimum required standards and clear management and operational responsibilities.\n\nCommodity exposures and risks are reported across the Group on a monthly basis to the members of the Risk Committee. A report on complex weather risks is prepared once each quarter.\n\nA hypothetical change in market prices at the reporting date of +10 percent or -10 percent would result in a theoretical increase in fair value and recognition in income in the amount of \u20ac767 million, or a decrease in fair value and recognition in expense in the amount of \u20ac768 million for the electricity derivatives (2022: \u00b1\u20ac1,338 million). A corresponding hypothetical change would result in a theoretical increase in fair value and recognition in income in the amount of \u20ac279 million or a decrease in fair value and recognition in expense in the amount of \u20ac279 million for gas derivatives (2022: \u00b1\u20ac810 million). Because commodity hedge accounting is only applied in individual cases, hypothetical changes in market prices result in only immaterial effects recognized in other comprehensive income.\n\n## Credit Risk Management\n\nIn order to minimize credit risk arising from operating activities and from the use of financial instruments, the Company enters into transactions only with counterparties that satisfy the Company's internally established minimum requirements. Maximum credit risk is confined by credit limits based on internal and (where available) external credit ratings. The setting and monitoring of credit limits is subject to certain minimum requirements, which are based on Group-wide credit risk management guidelines. Longterm operating contracts and asset management transactions are not comprehensively included in this process. They are monitored separately at the level of the responsible units.\n\nIn principle, each Group company is responsible for managing credit risk in its operating activities. Depending on the nature of the operating activities and the credit risk, additional credit risk monitoring and controls are performed both by the units and by Corporate Headquarters. Regular reports on credit limits, including their utilization, are submitted to the Risk Committee. Intensive, standardized monitoring of quantitative and qualitative earlywarning indicators, as well as close monitoring of the credit quality of counterparties, enable E.ON to act early in order to minimize risk.\n\nTo the extent possible, collateral is negotiated with counterparties for the purpose of reducing credit risk. Accepted as collateral are primarily guarantees issued by the respective parent companies, letters of comfort or evidence of profit and loss transfer agreements in combination with letters of awareness. To a lesser extent, the Company also requires bank guarantees and deposits of cash and securities as collateral to reduce credit risk. Risk management collateral in the forms mentioned above totaling \u20ac10.3 billion (2022: \u20ac61.0 billion) was used for setting limits. The lower wholesale market price level over the course of 2023 means that the collateral attributable to individual parent companies of our counterparties is lower and must be taken into account accordingly.\n\nDerivative transactions are generally executed on the basis of standard agreements that allow for the netting of all open transactions with individual counterparties. To further reduce credit risk, bilateral margining agreements are entered into with selected banks. Limits, which are regularly monitored, are imposed on the credit and liquidity risk resulting from bilateral margining agreements and exchange clearing. The systematic management of liquidity risk remains an important component of risk management at E.ON, particularly against the backdrop of the continued possibility of energy price volatility.\n\nThere is no credit risk with respect to the exchange-traded forward and option contracts with an aggregate nominal value of \u20ac21,979",

For the remaining financial instruments, the maximum risk of default is equal to their nominal amounts.\n\nAt E.ON, liquid funds are normally invested at banks with good credit ratings, in money market funds with first-class ratings or in short-term securities (for example, commercial paper) of issuers with strong credit ratings. Bonds of public and private issuers are also selected for investment. Group companies that for legal reasons are not included in the cash pool invest money at leading local banks. Standardized credit assessment and limit-setting is complemented by daily monitoring of CDS levels at the banks and at other significant counterparties.\n\n## Asset Management\n\nFor the purpose of financing long-term payment obligations, including those relating to asset retirement obligations (see Note 26) and cash investments, financial investments totaling \u20ac2.3 billion (2022: \u20ac2.4 billion) were held predominantly by German E.ON Group companies as of December 31, 2023.\n\nThese financial assets are invested on the basis of an accumulation strategy (total-return approach), with investments broadly diversified across the various asset classes, for example the money market, bond and equity asset classes, as well as alternative asset classes like real estate. The majority of the assets are held in investment funds managed by external fund managers. Corporate Asset Management at E.ON SE, which is part of the Company's Finance Department, is responsible for continuous monitoring of overall risks and those concerning individual fund managers. The three-month VaR with a 98 percent confidence interval for these financial assets was \u20ac78 million (2022: \u20ac166 million).\n\nThe liquidation of Versorgungskasse Energie VVaG (VKE i. L.) was almost complete as of December 31, 2023. Financial investments under management amounted to \u20ac46.0 million as of December 31,\n\n2023 (2022: \u20ac51.9 million). The company was deconsolidated on June 30, 2019.",

Leases are recognized in accordance with the right-of-use model as set out in IFRS 16. The tables in Note 15 present the development of the right-of-use assets by asset class. The net carrying amount of the rights of use at the balance sheet date of December 31, 2023, in the amount of \u20ac2,710 million (2022: \u20ac2,377 million) increased year-on-year by \u20ac333 million (2022: \u20ac47 million). In addition to the network business, the increase is primarily attributable to the areas of fiber optics, real estate and battery storage systems. Depreciation of right-of-use assets in the amount of \u20ac417 million (2022: \u20ac390 million) showed a slight increase compared with the prior year.\n\nTo ensure operative flexibility, in particular for real estate leases as well as in the area of wastewater disposal, extension and termination options are included in the agreements. In determining the lease term, E.ON considers all facts and circumstances that have an impact on the exercise of an extension option or the nonexercise of a termination option. In the determination of the lease liability, and correspondingly of the right-of-use assets, all reasonably certain cash outflows are taken into consideration. As of December 31, 2023, potential future cash outflows in the amount of \u20ac304 million (2022: \u20ac235 million) were not included in the lease liability as it is not reasonably certain that the leases will be renewed or not terminated. Possible future cash outflows for lease agreements that can be terminated without penalty by either party, subject to certain deadlines, are not included in this amount due to higher levels of uncertainty. Variable lease payments occur in only immaterial amounts and E.ON generally does not issue residual value guarantees. Leases not yet commenced to which E.ON as a lessee is committed result in potential future cash outflows over the expected lease terms of \u20ac26 million (2022: \u20ac110 million). The majority of the figure reported in 2022 related\n\nto future rental payments for the new office building of E.ON Sverige AB in Malm\u00f6, which was occupied in 2023 and is now included in the rights of use. The existing lease liabilities do not contain any covenant clauses that are linked to financial ratios.\n\nAs of the balance sheet date of December 31, 2023, right-of-use assets are offset by lease liabilities with a present value of \u20ac2,874 million (2022: \u20ac2,512 million) recognized under financial liabilities\n\n(see Note 27); the short-term portion of the lease liabilities totals \u20ac371 million (2022: \u20ac367 million). The maturity structure of the future payment obligations from leases is presented in Note 32. Due to the practical expedients used, the recognition of a right-ofuse asset is not necessary for low-value leases and leases with a lease term of less than 12 months. Instead, a lease expense is recognized in these cases. The following amounts are recognized in the income statement in connection with leases in the fiscal year:\n\n## E.ON as Lessee-Effects within the Income Statement\n\n| \u20ac in millions                                                  | 2023   | 2022   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Expenses from short-term leases (< 12 months)                  | 37     | 36     |\n| Expense for low-value leases not included in short-term leases | 18     | 11     |\n| Expense from variable lease payments                           | 11     | 14     |\n| Interest expense from leasing                                  | 185    | 162    |\n| Income from subleases                                          | -      | -      |\n| Gain/loss from sale and leaseback transactions                 | -3     | -6     |",

This includes the lease expense for short-term and low-value leases as well as the expense from variable lease payments and interest expense for the period. Payments allocated to the amortization of the lease liability are recognized in cash flows from financing activities in the amount of \u20ac383 million (2022: \u20ac357 million).\n\n## E.ON as Lessor\n\nE.ON enters into lease agreements as a lessor to a limited extent. Finance leases include technical equipment and machinery, in particular generation plants, that have been transferred to customers for use. Operating leases include assets that have been transferred for use, in particular real estate, heat and electricity generation plants and lines. There are no material risks in connection with rights retained to the assets temporarily transferred for use, with the result that risk management strategies, in particular, are not necessary. Residual-value guarantees are only entered into on an individual basis for purposes of additional hedging.\n\nThe present value of minimum lease payments is recognized under receivables from finance leases (see Note 18). The short-term portion totals \u20ac29 million (2022: \u20ac33 million). There were no material changes to net investments in the period under review.\n\nThe nominal and present values of the lease payments had the following maturities:\n\n## E.ON as Lessor-Finance Leases\n\n|                          |   Undiscounted lease payments Unrealized interest income |   Undiscounted lease payments Unrealized interest income |      |      | Discounted non-guaranteed  residual value   | Discounted non-guaranteed  residual value   |   Present value of minimum  lease payments |   Present value of minimum  lease payments |\n|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|------|------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|\n| \u20ac in millions            |                                                     2023 |                                                     2022 | 2023 | 2022 | 2023                                        | 2022                                        |                                       2023 |                                       2022 |\n| Due within 1 year        |                                                       46 |                                                       53 |   17 |   20 | -                                           | -                                           |                                         29 |                                         33 |\n| Due in 1 to 2 years      |                                                       49 |                                                       45 |   18 |   18 | -                                           | -                                           |                                         32 |                                         27 |\n| Due in 2 to 3 years      |                                                       38 |                                                       38 |   14 |   15 | -                                           | -                                           |                                         23 |                                         23 |\n| Due in 3 to 4 years      |                                                       33 |                                                       32 |   13 |   14 | 8                                           | 8                                           |                                         28 |                                         26 |\n| Due in 4 to 5 years      |                                                       32 |                                                       28 |   12 |   12 | -                                           | -                                           |                                         20 |                                         16 |\n| Due in more than 5 years |                                                      141 |                                                      174 |   33 |   44 | 12                                          | 11                                          |                                        120 |                                        141 |\n| Total                    |                                                      339 |                                                      370 |  107 |  123 | 20                                          | 19                                          |                                        252 |                                        266 |\n\nThe following effects from activity as lessor are recognized for the period under review:\n\n## E.ON as Lessor-Effects within the Income Statement\n\n| \u20ac in millions                                | 2023   | 2022   |\n|----------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Finance lease                                |        |        |\n| Gain/loss from the disposal of assets        | 1      | -      |\n| Financial income from net investments        | 20     | 21     |\n| Income from variable lease payments          | 2      | 5      |\n| Operating lease                              |        |        |\n| Income from leasing                          | 87     | 59     |\n| thereof income from variable lease  payments | -      | 19     |\n\nCash flows from operating leases are allocated to operating cash flow before interest and taxes.

Transactions with related parties in the reporting year and in the previous year are summarized as follows:\n\n## Related-Party Transactions\n\n| \u20ac in millions         | 2023   | 2022   |\n|-----------------------|--------|--------|\n| Income                | 2,232  | 3,881  |\n| Associated companies  | 1,587  | 3,235  |\n| Joint ventures        | 365    | 405    |\n| Other related parties | 280    | 241    |\n| Expenses              | 1,510  | 3,357  |\n| Associated companies  | 678    | 2,543  |\n| Joint ventures        | 161    | 298    |\n| Other related parties | 671    | 516    |\n| Receivables           | 1,007  | 1,199  |\n| Associated companies  | 437    | 695    |\n| Joint ventures        | 83     | 62     |\n| Other related parties | 487    | 442    |\n| Liabilities           | 2,494  | 2,590  |\n| Associated companies  | 1,090  | 1,543  |\n| Joint ventures        | 755    | 525    |\n| Other related parties | 648    | 521    |\n| Provisions            | 7      | 11     |\n| Associated companies  | 4      | 8      |\n| Joint ventures        | 3      | 3      |\n| Other related parties | -      | -      |\n\nIn 2023, E.ON generated income from transactions with related companies through the delivery of gas and electricity to distributors and municipal entities, especially municipal utilities. The relationships with these entities do not generally differ from those that exist with municipal entities in which E.ON does not have an interest. Expenses from transactions with related companies are generated mainly through electricity and gas deliveries as well as through management fees, IT services and third-party services.\n\nLiabilities of E.ON payable to related companies as of December 31, 2023, include \u20ac60 million (2022: \u20ac55 million) in trade payables and shareholder loans to operators of jointly owned nuclear power plants. These shareholder loans bear interest at 1.0 percent (2022: 1.0 percent) and have no fixed maturity. E.ON continues to have in place with these power plants a cost-transfer agreement and a cost-plus-fee agreement for the procurement of electricity. The settlement of such liabilities occurs mainly through clearing accounts.\n\nUnder IAS 24, compensation paid to key management personnel (members of the Management Board and of the Supervisory Board of E.ON SE) must be disclosed.\n\nThe total expense for 2023 for members of the Management Board amounted to \u20ac12.5 million (2022: \u20ac11.8 million) in shortterm benefits and \u20ac0.2 million (2022: \u20ac0.3 million) in postemployment benefits. The cost of post-employment benefits is equal to the service cost of the provisions for pensions.\n\nThe expense determined in accordance with IFRS 2 for existing commitments arising from share-based payment in 2023 was \u20ac11.0 million (2022: \u20ac2.7 million).\n\nProvisions for these commitments amounted to \u20ac18.0 million as of December 31, 2023 (2022: \u20ac10.1 million).\n\nThe members of the Supervisory Board received a total of \u20ac4.6 million for their activity in 2023 (2022: \u20ac5.0 million).\n\nEmployee representatives on the Supervisory Board were paid compensation under the existing employment contracts with subsidiaries totaling \u20ac0.9 million (2022: \u20ac1.0 million).",

To improve its meaningfulness as an indicator of the sustainable earnings power of the E.ON Group's business, unadjusted EBITDA is adjusted for certain non-operating effects.\n\nOperating earnings also include income from investment subsidies for which liabilities are recognized.\n\nThe non-operating earnings effects for which EBITDA is adjusted include, in particular, non-operating interest expense/income, income and expenses from the marking to market on the reporting date of unrealized commodity derivatives and related provisions for contingent losses, where material, book gains/losses, certain restructuring expenses, impairment charges and reversals recognized on equity investments in affiliated or associated companies, and other contributions to non-operating earnings. IAS 29 was applied for the first time in 2022 because of the hyperinflation in Turkey and the effects recognized in income are also presented in other non-operating earnings.\n\nIn addition, effects from the valuation of certain provisions on the balance sheet date are disclosed in non-operating earnings. In addition, effects that are to be initially recognized from the subsequent measurement of hidden reserves and charges in connection with the innogy purchase price allocation are included.\n\nNet book gains/losses were minor in 2023 and resulted mainly from the combination of VSEH and ZSE in Slovakia. Book gains in the prior year consist in particular of the partial disposal of Westconnect.\n\nRestructuring expenses in the 2023 financial year were below those of the prior year and included, as in the prior year, primarily expenditures in conjunction with the restructuring of the sales business in the United Kingdom.\n\nEffects in connection with derivative financial instruments changed by \u20ac1,110 million to -\u20ac4,233 million. The reason was that prices on commodity markets decreased almost continually during the year, which led to declining fair value measurements on forward sales and procurement contracts.\n\nNon-operating expense/income mainly consists of earnings effects of -\u20ac229 million (prior year: \u20ac286 million) at shareholdings in Turkey accounted for using the equity method in conjunction with the application of IAS 29 and a significantly lower valuation effects\n\nof -\u20ac130 million (prior year: -\u20ac410 million). PreussenElektra's earnings, which are disclosed as non-operating income effective 2023, had a countervailing effect (\u20ac289 million).\n\nAlong with the depreciation charges in connection with the innogy purchase-price allocation, which are disclosed separately, E.ON recorded impairment charges mainly on specific assets at Customer Solutions and on the IFRS book value of VSEH in Slovakia at Energy Networks.\n\nThe decline in non-operating interest expense/income resulted from the altered direction of interest-rate movements. An increase in interest rates in the prior year led to income from accruals on non-current provisions for asset-retirement obligations, provisions for recultivation and remediation obligations, and other noncurrent provisions. In the interim interest rates declined relative to prior-year balance-sheet date. By contrast, E.ON recorded positive valuation effect on securities recognized at fair value. The positive effect of \u20ac187 million (prior year: \u20ac204 million) from the difference between the nominal interest rate and the effective interest rate of former innogy bonds adjusted due to the purchaseprice allocation is still recorded under non-operating interest expense/income.\n\nThe non-operating tax result is primarily influenced by the fair value measurement of commodity derivatives in various countries with different tax rates and by reversals of deferred taxes due to the improved earnings situation in Germany and the United Kingdom and taxes for previous years mainly from changes in tax provisions.\n\nNon-controlling interests' share of operating earnings rose from \u20ac517 million to \u20ac912 million mainly because of higher operating earnings at companies at the network business in Germany with a significant proportion of non-controlling interests. This development resulted from a larger regulated asset base compared with the prior year and the recording of a price-driven increase in network fees.",

This consists of nonperformance-based compensation (base salary, fringe benefits) and performance-based compensation (bonus, long-term variable compensation).\n\nIn 2023, the members of the Management Board were granted seventh-tranche virtual shares under the E.ON Performance Plan (2022: sixth tranche of the E.ON Performance Plan) with a value of \u20ac7.8 million (2022: \u20ac7.8 million) and a total number of shares of 832,082 (2022: 607,760) as part of the total compensation.\n\nTotal payments to former members of the Management Board and their beneficiaries amounted to \u20ac16.3 million (2022: \u20ac14.0 million). Provisions of \u20ac170.6 million (2022: \u20ac184.5 million) have been established for the pension obligations to former members of the Management Board and their beneficiaries.\n\nThere were no loans to members of the Management Board in 2023.\n\n## (37) Subsequent Events\n\n## Changes to the Business Model\n\nOn September 11, 2023, the Management Board approved a new management concept for the E.ON Group. Effective from January 1, 2024, this entails a change in the definition of certain operating segments in accordance with IFRS 8 and the reallocation of the current goodwill amounts for all operating segments affected by the changes and reporting goodwill as of January 1, 2024. The Management Board's decision was regarded as an opportunity to test the goodwill of the existing operating segments for impairment. The impairment tests carried out as of September 2023 found no indication of impairment. Following the entry into force of the new management concept, the goodwill amounts reallocated as of January 1, 2024, are subject to the provisions of IAS 36 on impairment testing. In the new Energy Infrastructure Solutions segment, there may be an impairment risk of up to a mid-triple-digit million euro amount.\n\n## Corporate Bonds Issued\n\nE.ON issued two green corporate bonds at the beginning of January 2024. One bond has a volume of \u20ac750 million due in January 2031 with a 3.375 percent coupon; the other bond has a volume of \u20ac750 million due in January 2036 with a 3.75 percent coupon.\n\n## Arbitration Proceeding in Spain\n\nE.ON SE, E.ON Finanzanlagen GmbH and E.ON Iberia Holding GmbH are plaintiffs in arbitration proceedings against the Kingdom of Spain. In the arbitration proceedings, the three companies are asserting claims for damages for changes to the Spanish renewable energies subsidies regime. The arbitration proceedings have been pending at the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) their registration on August 10, 2015. On January 18, 2024, an arbitration court\n\nawarded the companies damages totaling approximately \u20ac0.3 billion. Because not all legal remedies have yet been pursued and there are therefore currently uncertainties regarding the final outcome of the proceedings, E.ON is not recognizing either a receivable or any associated income in the 2023 financial statements, and instead a contingent receivable is reported (see Note 18).\n\n## Termination of Operating Concession Wastewater Treatment Plant in Croatia\n\nA concession agreement for the operation of a wastewater treatment plant exists between Zagrebacke otpadne vode d.o.o., a company consolidated at equity in the E.ON Group, and the City of Zagreb. By majority resolution of the City Assembly on January 25, 2024, the City of Zagreb exercised its contractually agreed right to unilaterally terminate this concession. This results in a six-month period from the receipt of the termination letter of February 2, 2024, during which the city will either acquire the individual assets of Zagrebacke otpadne vode d.o.o. or the shares held by E.ON in this company. The City of Zagreb has yet to determine how the sale will take place at the time of preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements. The financial impact of the transactions cannot yet be reliably estimated at the time of preparation. Under the terms of the concession agreement, the disposal value will initially be determined by a consultant to be appointed jointly. The associate is allocated to the Energy Networks ECE/Turkey segment.",

In addition, we have audited the management report of the Company and the Group (hereinafter referred to as 'combined group management report') of E.ON SE for the financial year from 1 January to 31 December 2023.\n\nIn accordance with German legal requirements, we have not audited the content of those components of the combined management report specified in the \"Other Information\" section of our auditor's report.\n\nIn our opinion, on the basis of the knowledge obtained in the audit,\n\n- \u00b7 the accompanying consolidated financial statements comply, in all material respects, with the IFRSs as adopted by the EU, and the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to Section 315e (1) HGB [Handelsgesetzbuch: German Commercial Code] and, in compliance with these requirements, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, and financial position of the Group as at 31 December 2023, and of its financial performance for the financial year from 1 January to 31 December 2023, and\n- \u00b7 the accompanying combined group management report as a whole provides an appropriate view of the Group's position. In all material respects, this combined group management report is consistent with the consolidated financial statements, complies with German legal requirements and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development. Our opinion on the combined group management report does not cover the content of those components of the combined group management report specified in the \"Other Information\" section of the auditor's report.\n\nPursuant to Section 322 (3) sentence 1 HGB, we declare that our audit has not led to any reservations relating to the legal compliance of the consolidated financial statements and of the combined group management report..\n\n## Basis for the Opinions\n\nWe conducted our audit of the consolidated financial statements and of the combined group management report in accordance with Section 317 HGB and the EU Audit Regulation No 537/2014 (referred to subsequently as \"EU Audit Regulation\") and in compliance with German Generally Accepted Standards for Financial Statement Audits promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftspr\u00fcfer [Institute of Public Auditors in Germany] (IDW). Our responsibilities under those requirements and principles are further described in the \"Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements and of the Combined group management report\" section of our auditor's report. We are independent of the group entities in accordance with the requirements of European law and German commercial and professional law, and we have fulfilled our other German professional responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. In addition, in accordance with Article 10 (2) (f) of the EU Audit Regulation, we declare that we have not provided non-audit services prohibited under Article 5 (1) of the EU Audit Regulation. We believe that the evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinions on the\n\nconsolidated financial statements and on the combined group management report.\n\n## Key Audit Matters in the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements for the financial year from 1 January to 31 December 2023. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n## Accounting for derivatives relating to sales and procurement contracts for electricity and gas supplies (commodity forward transactions) and provisions for salesrelated onerous contracts\n\nPlease refer to Note [1] to the consolidated financial statements for information on the accounting policies applied. The disclosures on Accounting for derivatives relating to sales and procurement contracts for electricity and gas supplies (commodity forward transactions) and provisions for sales-related onerous contracts are presented in the notes to the consolidated financial statements under notes [9], [18], [26] and [27].\n\n## THE FINANCIAL STATEMENT RISK\n\nIn the consolidated financial statements as at 31 December 2023 E.ON SE recognised market values for derivatives in connection with commodity forward transactions of EUR 6.7 billion in the other operating assets and market values of EUR 10.8 billion in the non-current and current (other) operating liabilities for procurement and sales transactions that are accounted for at fair value in accordance with the provisions of IFRS 9: Financial Instruments. Provisions for onerous contracts were reported in the amount of EUR 0.1 billion.\n\nE.ON maintains portfolios of sales and procurement contracts for electricity and gas supplies with various customer and supplier",

The contracts in these portfolios are predominantly entered and processed by way of mass processes.\n\nDiscretion is required when determining whether a commodity forward transaction was concluded to satisfy own requirements and is being held for this purpose and therefore fulfils the own-use criteria on initial and subsequent recognition. In compliance with the requirements of IFRS 9, the underlying contracts are to be classified as \"own use\" contracts or as derivative financial instruments and monitored on an ongoing basis. With regard to the consolidated financial statements, there is a risk that these may be incompletely or incorrectly recognised and/or incorrectly classified. There is also the risk that a change in purpose at a later date will not be recognised and the contracts will not be properly accounted for.\n\nFair values are to be determined for the commodity forward transactions classified as derivative financial instruments. Provided that no market prices are observable, the fair values are to be determined on the basis of recognised valuation methods. The methods, assumptions and data used for this purpose require judgement. There is a risk for the financial statements that the other operating assets, the (other) operating liabilities and the other operating income will not be measured or determined in line with the accounting requirements.\n\nIn the context of its business activities, E.ON fulfils its sales obligations towards customers through commodity forward transactions. If there is a risk of losses from sales obligations, provisions for onerous contracts must be recognised. The amount of the provisions is determined based on the best possible estimate of the amount by which the unavoidable costs of fulfilling the contract will exceed the expected economic benefit of the contract, i.e. generally the agreed sales price for sales transactions.\n\nA direct allocation of procurement transactions to individual sales obligations is generally not possible for electricity and gas supply companies and thus also not possible within the E.ON Group. The recognition and measurement of recognised provisions for onerous contracts from pending sales transactions - in due consideration of the various procurement transactions of the E.ON Group - are consequently based on complex allocations and calculations for the sales portfolios of the E.ON Group as well as estimates requiring judgement by management, for example the future expected contribution margins of the sales portfolios. There is the risk for the consolidated financial statements that provisions are not recognised or not in the amount required.\n\n## OUR AUDIT APPROACH\n\nIn the course of our audit, we obtained a comprehensive insight into the development of commodity forward transactions and the associated risks as well as an understanding of E.ON's process used to record and classify these transactions and to recognise and assess sales from the portfolio in terms of the permissibility of the own-use criteria.\n\nFor the IT and individual data processing systems deployed, with the involvement of our IT specialists we evaluated the effectiveness of the rules and procedures relating to a large number of IT applications and which support the effectiveness of the application controls.\n\nWith the involvement of our specialists for financial instruments, we assessed the appropriateness, implementation and effectiveness of the controls established by E.ON to recognise and classify commodity forward transactions and to completely and accurately recognise and assess sales from the portfolio in terms of the permissibility of the own-use criteria.\n\nWe used analyses to satisfy ourselves that the commodity forward transactions were properly recognised and classified. In the case of sales, we assessed whether there was a change in purpose and\n\nwhether it was recognised in the consolidated balance sheet appropriately.\n\nFurthermore, with regard to the measurement of commodity forward transactions for which no market prices are observable, we made enquiries with the involvement of our valuation specialists and gained insight into the relevant documents and, in doing so, assessed the selection of methods, data and assumptions used for measurement. To assess the methodically and mathematically correct implementation of the valuation method, our valuation experts verified E.ON's valuation using their own calculations and analysed deviations for a risk-based selection. Price and market information observable in the market were used where possible.\n\nIn addition, we assessed the appropriateness of the key data and assumptions as well as the method used by E.ON in relation to the recognition of provisions for onerous contracts for sales portfolios. To this end, we verified the allocations of the procurement transactions to the sales portfolios and also discussed the expected future contribution margins in the various sales portfolios of the E.ON Group with those responsible for planning. To ensure the computational accuracy of the method used, we verified the Company's calculations on the basis of selected riskbased elements.\n\n## OUR OBSERVATIONS\n\nThe recognition, classification and ongoing monitoring of commodity forward transactions has been carried out appropriately. The methods, assumptions and data used to measure commodity forward transactions and provisions for onerous contracts are appropriate.\n\n## Recoverability of goodwill\n\nPlease refer to Note [1] to the consolidated financial statements for information on the accounting policies applied.

If impairment triggers arise during the financial year, an event-driven goodwill impairment test is also carried out during the year. The goodwill is allocated to the cash-generating units or groups of cashgenerating units, which essentially correspond to the operating segments at the E.ON Group. For the goodwill impairment test, the carrying amount is compared with the recoverable amount of the relevant cash-generating units or groups of cash-generating units. If the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount, an impairment loss is recognised. At E.ON, the recoverable amount is initially calculated as the fair value less costs to sell.\n\nThe goodwill impairment test is complex and based on a number of assumptions requiring judgement. These include the estimate of the expected business and earnings performance of the operating segments, the assumed long-term growth rates and the discount rate used.\n\nOn 11 September 2023, the Board of Management of E.ON passed a resolution on a new management concept for the E.ON Group. The concept is effective from 1 January 2024 and requires a change in the definition of some segments according to IFRS 8 and, in this context, a reallocation of the current goodwill for all segments affected by the changes and carrying goodwill as at 1 January 2024. The Board of Management's decision was seen as an event triggering testing of the recoverability of goodwill for the segments affected by the changes and carrying goodwill.\n\nAs a result of the impairment tests conducted, the Company did not identify any need for impairment. Furthermore, no requirement to recognise an impairment loss was identified in the course of the annual impairment testing.\n\nThere is the risk for the consolidated financial statements that impairment existing as at the reporting date was not identified. There is also the risk that the related disclosures in the notes are not appropriate).\n\n## OUR AUDIT APPROACH\n\nFirst, we obtained an understanding of the process for impairment testing of goodwill through explanations provided by staff of the finance organisation and by evaluating the Company's documentation. With the involvement of our valuation experts, we assessed (among other things) the appropriateness of the significant assumptions and the Company's calculation method for both annual as well as indicator-based (ad hoc) impairment testing. To this end, we discussed and validated the expected cash flows and the assumed long-term growth rates with those responsible for planning. We also carried out reconciliations with the budget drawn up by management and approved by the Supervisory Board for the following year and the medium-term planning, including the projected development for the next three to five years, that has been acknowledged by the Supervisory Board. In addition, we assessed the consistency of the assumptions with external market forecasts.\n\nWe also confirmed the accuracy of the Company's previous forecasts by comparing the budgets of previous financial years with actual results and by analysing deviations. We compared the assumptions and data underlying the weighted average cost of capital, especially the risk-free interest rate, the market risk premium and the beta factor, with our own assumptions and publicly available data.\n\nTo assess the methodically and mathematically correct implementation of the valuation method, we verified the valuation\n\nperformed by the Company using our own calculations and analysed deviations.\n\nIn order to take account of the existing forecast uncertainty and the early cut-off date for impairment testing, we investigated the impact of possible changes in the discount rate, earnings performance and the long-term growth rate on the recoverable amount by calculating alternative scenarios and comparing them with the values stated by the Company (sensitivity analysis).\n\nFinally, we assessed whether the disclosures in the notes regarding impairment of goodwill are appropriate.\n\n## OUR OBSERVATIONS\n\nThe calculation method used for impairment testing of goodwill is appropriate and in line with the accounting policies to be applied.\n\nThe Company's assumptions and data underlying the measurement are appropriate.\n\nThe related disclosures in the notes are appropriate.\n\n## Other Information\n\nThe The Board of Management and/or the Supervisory Board are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the following components of the combined group management report, whose content was not audited:\n\n- \u00b7 the sections marked as \"not part of the statutory audit\" and the disclosures contained there and thus marked as unaudited; and\n- \u00b7 the combined corporate governance statement of the Company and the Group referred to in the combined group management report.\n\nThe other information also includes the remaining parts of the annual report.

We have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n## Responsibility of the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board for the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Combined group management report\n\nBoard of Management is responsible for the preparation of consolidated financial statements that comply, in all material respects, with IFRSs as adopted by the EU, and the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to Section 315e (1) HGB and that the consolidated financial statements, in compliance with these requirements, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position, and financial performance of the Group. In addition, the Board of Management is responsible\n\nfor such internal control as they have determined necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud (i.e., fraudulent financial reporting and misappropriation of assets) or error.\n\nIn preparing the consolidated financial statements, the Board of Management is responsible for assessing the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. They also have the responsibility for disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern. In addition, they are responsible for financial reporting based on the going concern basis of accounting unless there is an intention to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or there is no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\nFurthermore, the Board of Management is responsible for the preparation of the combined group management report that, as a whole, provides an appropriate view of the Group's position and is, in all material respects, consistent with the consolidated financial statements, complies with German legal requirements, and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development. In addition, the Board of Management is responsible for such arrangements and measures (systems) as it has considered necessary to enable the preparation of a combined group management report that is in accordance with the applicable German legal requirements, and to be able to provide sufficient appropriate evidence for the assertions in the combined group management report.\n\nThe Supervisory Board is responsible for overseeing the Group's financial reporting process for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and of the combined group management report.\n\n## Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements and of the Combined group management report\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and whether the combined group management report as a whole provides an appropriate view of the Group's position and, in all material respects, is consistent with the consolidated financial statements and the knowledge obtained in the audit, complies with the German legal requirements and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development, as well as to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the combined group management report.\n\nReasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with Section 317 HGB and the EU Audit Regulation and in compliance with German Generally Accepted Standards for Financial Statement Audits promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftspr\u00fcfer (IDW) will always detect a material misstatement. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements and this combined management report.\n\nWe exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n\n- \u00b7 Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements and of the combined group management report, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinions. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal controls.",

On the basis of sufficient appropriate audit evidence we evaluate, in particular, the significant assumptions used by the Board of Management as a basis for the prospective information, and evaluate the proper derivation of the prospective information from these assumptions. We do not express a separate opinion on the prospective information and on the assumptions used as a basis. There is a substantial unavoidable risk that future events will differ materially from the prospective information.\n\nWe communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.\n\nWe also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with the relevant independence requirements, and communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, the actions taken or safeguards applied to eliminate independence threats.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters.

We also:\n\n- \u00b7 Identify and assess the risks of material intentional or unintentional non-compliance with the requirements of Section 328 (1) HGB, design and perform assurance procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain assurance evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our assurance opinion.\n- \u00b7 Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the assurance on the ESEF documents in order to design assurance procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an assurance opinion on the effectiveness of these controls.\n- \u00b7 Evaluate the technical validity of the ESEF documents, i.e. whether the file made available containing the ESEF documents meets the requirements of the Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/815, as amended as at the reporting date, on the technical specification for this electronic file.\n- \u00b7 Evaluate whether the ESEF documents provide an XHTML rendering with content equivalent to the audited consolidated financial statements and the audited combined group management report.\n- \u00b7 Evaluate whether the tagging of the ESEF documents with Inline XBRL technology (iXBRL) in accordance with the requirements of Articles 4 and 6 of the Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/815, as amended as at the reporting date, enables an appropriate and complete machine-readable XBRL copy of the XHTML rendering.\n\n## Further Information pursuant to Article 10 of the EU Audit Regulation\n\nWe were elected as group auditor at the Annual General Meeting on 17 May 2023. We were engaged by the Audit and Risk\n\nCommittee of the Supervisory Board on 6 December 2023. We have been the group auditor of E.ON SE without interruption since financial year 2021.\n\nWe declare that the opinions expressed in this auditor's report are consistent with the additional report to the Audit Committee pursuant to Article 11 of the EU Audit Regulation (long-form audit report).\n\n## Other Matter - Use of the Auditor's Report\n\nOur auditor's report must always be read together with the audited consolidated financial statements and the audited combined group management report as well as the examined ESEF documents. The consolidated financial statements and combined group management report converted to the ESEF format including the versions to be entered in the German Company Register [Unternehmensregister] - are merely electronic renderings of the audited consolidated financial statements and the audited combined group management report and do not take their place. In particular, the ESEF report and our assurance opinion contained therein are to be used solely together with the examined ESEF documents provided in electronic form.\n\n## German Public Auditor Responsible for the Engagement\n\nThe German Public Auditor responsible for the engagement is Gereon Lurweg.\n\nD\u00fcsseldorf, 5 March 2024\n\nKPMG AG\n\nWirtschaftspr\u00fcfungsgesellschaft\n\nKneisel\n\nLurweg Wirtschaftspr\u00fcfer [German Public Auditor]\n\nWirtschaftspr\u00fcfer\n\n[German Public Auditor]",

Furthermore, management is responsible for such internal control as they consider necessary to enable the preparation of a consolidated non-financial statement that is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error (manipulation of the consolidated non-financial statement as well\n\nand the German original. We do not accept any liability for the use of, or reliance on, the English translation or for any errors or misunderstandings that may arise from the translation.\n\nas the further qualitative and quantitative sustainability information).\n\nThe EU Taxonomy Regulation and the Delegated Acts issued thereunder contain wording and terms that are still subject to considerable interpretation uncertainties and for which clarifications have not yet been published in every case. Therefore, management has disclosed their interpretation of the EU Taxonomy Regulation and the Delegated Acts adopted thereunder in section 'EU Taxonomy' of the consolidated non-financial statement. They are responsible for the defensibility of this interpretation. Due to the immanent risk that indeterminate legal terms may be interpreted differently, the legal conformity of the interpretation is subject to uncertainties.\n\n## Independence and Quality Assurance of the Assurance Practitioner's firm\n\nWe have complied with the independence and quality assurance requirements set out in the national legal provisions and professional pronouncements, in particular the Professional Code for German Public Auditors and Chartered Accountants (in Germany) and the quality assurance standard of the German Institute of Public Auditors ( Institut der Wirtschaftspr\u00fcfer, IDW ) regarding quality assurance requirements in audit practice (IDW QMS 1 (09.2022)).\n\n## Responsibility of the Assurance Practitioner\n\nOur responsibility is to express a conclusion based on our assurance engagement\n\n- \u00b7 with limited assurance on the consolidated non-financial statement for the period from January 1 to December 31 2023",

This includes making steady progress toward our climate targets, effectively managing climate-related risks, seizing climate-related opportunities that fit with our corporate strategy, and reporting transparently on all these matters. To ensure that we do so, we have put in place a highly effective governance structure.\n\nThe TCFD's recommendations provide important guidance for reporting. Established in 2015, the TCFD aims to develop consistent, comparable, and accurate climate-related financial risk disclosures that companies can use to provide information to investors, lenders, insurers, and other stakeholders. E.ON became an official TCFD supporter in 2019, which marks the start of our TCFD reporting below. Going forward, we will continue to expand our TCFD reporting. One consequence of TCFD reporting is that we have developed a qualitative scenario analysis to assess how our businesses might be affected under different climate scenarios.\n\n\u203a In addition, the TCFD reporting is supported by additional information in the publication 'On course for net zero-Supporting paper for E.ON's decarbonization strategy and climate-related disclosures.' \u2039\n\n## Governance\n\nThe importance of climate change for E.ON is reflected in our governance. The Management Board has overall responsibility for the sustainability strategy, including the climate targets. It is informed on a quarterly basis by the Chief Sustainability Officer ('CSO') about important initiatives and developments as well as KPIs. The CSO manages and monitors all of the Company's sustainability activities and chairs the Sustainability Council. The council is E.ON's most important forum for discussing\n\nsustainability issues, establishing a sustainable mindset, and embedding it in business processes. The Supervisory Board is regularly informed about material sustainability topics by its Audit and Risk Committee, by its Innovation and Sustainability Committee, and by the Management Board. As part of the carbon management plan introduced in 2022, emission reduction paths were defined for the business units to implement the Group's climate targets at the local level. Our units conduct annual controls to ensure that we are on track to meet our targets.\n\n## Strategy\n\nE.ON's business operations cause carbon emissions. Yet our two core businesses-Energy Networks and Customer Solutions-also help millions of customers avoid emissions. They make the energy system more efficient and increase the proportion of renewables in the energy mix.\n\nE.ON's current climate strategy includes emission-reduction targets for 2030, 2040 and 2050. In 2020 E.ON set new climate targets and intends to be climate-neutral by 2040 (Scope 1 and 2).\n\nBoth climate change and the energy transition aimed at slowing it could create risks as well as opportunities for E.ON's business. A scenario analysis models how the key value drivers of E.ON and five of our business units might be affected under different scenarios through 2050. The analysis consisted of three different climate scenarios: a conservative, ambitious, and fully committed climate policy. Subject experts analyzed the implications, which were used to conduct a risk-and-opportunity assessment. It shows that we have a robust business model and great opportunities for decarbonization for every scenario. E.ON's high proportion of regulated business makes it robust, while massive electrification and decarbonization offer major opportunities for the Company's business model. In view of these important findings, we intend to review of the scenario analysis on an annual basis. We again began a qualitative scenario analysis at the end of 2023.\n\n## Risk Management\n\nE.ON regularly monitors and assesses its non-financial, climate, and other sustainability risks and opportunities and their potential impact in the short, medium, and long term. In 2020 we integrated climate related risks into our Enterprise Risk Management system. In 2021 human rights risks in the supply chain, employee matters, social matters, and anti-corruption were integrated as well. Risk and sustainability managers at the units were actively involved in this process. The status of this process is presented to the E.ON Group Risk Committee on a regular basis. Our analyses of climate risks encompass physical risks (such as extreme weather and rising temperatures) as well as transitional risks (such as changes in consumer preferences, the regulatory environment, and carbon pricing). The Risks and Chances Report contains additional information.\n\n## Metrics and Targets\n\nE.ON's current climate metrics consist mainly of the emission figures for its carbon footprint categories (Scope 1, 2, and 3) and the measurement of progress toward its climate targets (see above). The climate targets defined in 2020 remain valid (see Climate Protection chapter). We monitor progress toward these targets on an annual basis for all relevant GHG categories. The aforementioned carbon management plan apportions our emission-reduction targets to the business units, while giving them the operational decision-making authority on how to achieve them.\n\nIn addition, E.ON discloses avoided emissions. This applies to the annual reporting for its green bonds, which includes disclosures on the metric tons of CO2e avoided by the projects funded. A green bond is a fixed-interest security whose issuance proceeds are used to fund infrastructure and energy-efficiency projects that yield measurable carbon savings. In 2023 E.ON issued three green bonds totaling \u20ac2.5 billion.",

Capital markets in particular want standardized ESG KPIs. Consequently, this report discloses KPIs on our ESG performance over three years.\n\nIn addition, since 2010 we have reported our KPIs in accordance with standards of the German Association for Financial Analysis and Asset Management (German abbreviation: 'DVFA') and the European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies ('EFFAS'). KPIs that reflect these standards are indicated by the DVFA/EFFAS ID. KPIs that are particularly important to us are highlighted.\n\nThe audit levels of the KPIs that were part of the independent Sustainability Assurance or the audit of the consolidated financial statements can be found in the Combined Group Management Report as well as the Annexes to the Combined Group Management Report. The About This Report chapter explains how the respective KPIs are marked and with which audit level they were audited.\n\n## Environment\n\n## Climate protection 1\n\n|                                                                                          | DVFA/EFFAS   |   2023 |   2022 | 2021      |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|--------|--------|-----------|\n| Greenhouse gas emissions (total CO\u2082 equivalents in million  metric tons, location-based) | E03-01       |  76.17 |  86.81 | 107.99    |\n| Greenhouse gas emissions (total CO\u2082 equivalents in million  metric tons, market-based)   | E03-01       |  73.41 |  91.29 | 113.02  8 |\n| Scope 1 2, 3                                                                             | E02-01       |   2.01 |   2.88 | 3.71      |\n| Scope 2 (location-based) 4                                                               | E02-01       |   3.46 |   3.38 | 3.90      |\n| Scope 2 (market-based) 5                                                                 | E02-01       |   6.17 |   5.83 | 5.73      |\n| Scope 3 (location-based) 3, 6, 7                                                         | E02-01       |  70.69 |  80.55 | 100.38    |\n| Scope 3 (market-based)                                                                   | E02-01       |  65.23 |  82.58 | 103.58    |\n\nThe Climate Protection chapter contains more information.",
