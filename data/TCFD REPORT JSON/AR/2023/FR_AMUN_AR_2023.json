The first is a historical link with the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole group and its Banque Universelle de Proximit\u00e9, or universal client-focused banking model, which enables the distribution of savings solutions across all our networks as part of a comprehensive, coordinated approach to our clients' needs. The second driving force is Amundi's simultaneous ability to grow on its own by expanding its geographical footprint internationally through partnerships with new distributors, joint ventures and acquisitions.\n\n'Thanks to its strong Cr\u00e9dit Agricole group roots, unique business model and rigorous management, Amundi has continued to grow both commercially and financially despite a sluggish asset management market.'\n\nPHILIPPE BRASSAC\n\nChair\n\nAnd lastly, by remaining attentive to operational and budgetary efficiency, allowing to stabilise volume-adjusted costs while continuing to invest, particularly in technology.\n\n2023 was also a year of brisk business momentum for Amundi, which once again cleared the symbolic threshold of 2 trillion euros in assets under management despite a sluggish asset management market, with strong financial results (+3.9% (2) compared with 2022).\n\nThese various factors have led the Board of Directors to propose a dividend of 4.10 euros per share to the Annual General Shareholders' Meeting, unchanged from the dividend paid in respect of the 2022 financial year. This dividend corresponds to a pay-out ratio of 72% net income, Group share (3) .\n\nI have full confidence that Amundi will continue its successful long-term development trajectory, keeping pace with the major changes in our society and serving as a trusted partner for all our clients.\n\n- (1) See glossary.\n- (2) Adjusted data, excludes amortisation of intangible assets and Lyxor integration costs in 2022.\n\n(3) The dividend pay-out ratio is calculated on the basis of adjusted net profit attributable to equity holders of the parent (\u20ac1,165m), including the amortisation of intangible assets (contracts relating to the acquisition of Lyxor and distribution contracts relating to previous transactions).\n\n<!-- image -->",

Global growth is expected to come in at 2.7%, with inflation falling towards the targets set by the central banks. Inflationary risks remain on the upside, due in particular to a disorderly energy transition, geopolitical conflicts, increased  protectionist  measures  and  unforeseen climate  events.

ShareAction evaluated 257 shareholder resolutions in 2023.\n\nTo cut greenhouse gas emissions linked to purchasing, Amundi aims to work with suppliers who are committed to  reducing  their  own  carbon  footprint.  By  2025, Amundi has  set  itself  the  target  of  sourcing  at  least 35%  of  its  goods  and  services  outside  the  Cr\u00e9dit Agricole group from suppliers committed to decarbonisation.  More  generally,  Amundi  takes  the CSR  risk  into  account  when  assessing  its  suppliers. Accordingly,  the  weighting  allocated  to  CSR  issues in  the  multi-criteria  analysis  grids  for  short  list  bids increased from 15% to 35% in 2022.\n\nAmundi has made purchasing a lever for employment for disadvantaged  groups,  entrusting \u20ac500,000 in  2023  to  companies  in  the  sheltered  employment sector  (EA  /  ESAT (1) ),  12%  more  than  in  2022.

What is your policy in this area?\n\nAmundi has always considered the individual and collective development of its employees central to its responsibility as an employer. Adapting human resources to changes in Amundi's business lines is also critical to the company's strategy. And it is successfully meeting the twofold challenge of development and adaptation that has enabled us to support the Group's strong growth in recent years. To achieve this, Amundi relies on a number of measures designed to promote mobility and, by extension, employability. These include cross-functional training programmes, which have continued to grow in number and diversity.\n\nThere are also more targeted initiatives, aimed at developing managerial talent or preparing employees to occupy key positions within the company. Such is the purpose of the Amundi Tomorrow programme, for example, launched at the end of 2023.\n\n## Does internal mobility suffice to cover all needs, including those abroad and staffing in technology-intensive professions?\n\nAmong the sector's major players, Amundi has one of the highest levels of functional and geographical mobility. This proactive policy, which reconciles individual aspirations with the needs of the company, is fully endorsed by our employees. Alongside other societal or social values promoted by Amundi, including diversity, gender equality, social dialogue, quality of life, etc., it contributes to the attractiveness of our employer brand. So, Amundi not only has the capacity to develop specific profiles, we are also able to attract them. This is true both at home and internationally, where it is often essential to combine local skills with the Group's expertise. And it holds in areas such as IT, where needs are set to grow with the rise of Amundi Technology.\n\n## What are the main challenges of managing talent, whether internal or external?\n\nThe main challenge is to stay one step ahead when it comes to anticipating business needs, as we have succeeded in doing so far. This is why, for example, we have launched programmes to assess the impact of artificial intelligence on employment. But we must also continue to shape our future, by fostering the emergence of tomorrow's managers.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Amundi publishes studies for its clients that describe these risks and their economic evolution, as well as the solutions to capitalise on them.\n\n## Main risks\n\nIn the course of its business, Amundi is mainly exposed to risks related to third-party asset management acti -vities and financial risks, arising mainly from the mana -gement of its investment portfolio and the guarantees granted to certain products:\n\n## Asset management risks\n\n- \u00b7 Operational risks, including:\n- > non-compliance with investment rules and misalignment of management practices and client promises:\n- > process malfunction, human error;\n- > non-compliance, tax, regulatory and legal;\n- > business discontinuity (including cybersecurity).\n- \u00b7 Business risks.\n- \u00b7 Non-financial risks:\n- > non-alignment  with  investor  expectations  in  terms of  ESG  exemplarity  and  engagement  (especially with regard to sustainability, climate, etc.).\n- \u00b7 CSR risks (including duty of care, corruption).\n\n## Financial risks\n\n- \u00b7 Credit risks.\n- \u00b7 Market risks.\n\n## MONITORING THE INTEGRITY OF OUR ESG STRATEGY\n\nEarning and maintaining our clients' trust is paramount. Any failure to meet their CSR or ESG expectations could harm Amundi's reputation. In this respect, non-financial risks in the portfolios are strictly controlled by exposure limits, defined on the basis of ratings resulting from analyses carried out by a dedicated team according to ESG criteria. This work is supplemented by additional indicators and limits, depending on internal policy and/or regulatory developments (carbon footprint, risks associated with climate change, etc.). Compliance with these limits is monitored on a daily basis. The non-financial risks borne by the company are addressed by policies relating to its operations (procurement governance, human resources policies, etc.) implemented by the business lines concerned.",

During their strategy seminar, they were asked to reflect on the Net Zero framework and its deployment within Amundi's  Responsible  Investment  strategy.  To deepen  their  knowledge  of  environmental  issues, they also received specific training on the challenges of nature and biodiversity.\n- (2) Twelve directors are appointed by the Annual General Shareholders' Meeting, and one is elected under the employee representation scheme.\n- (3) Not including the employee-elected director.

G\u00e9rald Gr\u00e9goire , chosen in particular for his expertise in the commercial field, is also Deputy  Chief  Executive  Officer  of  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  S.A.,  in charge of the Client and Development division.\n\nThe same Board also decided, on the recommendation of its Appointment Committee, to submit to the General Shareholders'  Meeting  of  May  2024  the  renewal  of  the mandates  of  the  following  four  directors  for  three  financial years:\n\n- \u00b7 Patrice Genti\u00e9 ;\n- \u00b7 G\u00e9rald Gr\u00e9goire ;\n- \u00b7 Mich\u00e8le Guibert ;\n- \u00b7 Nathalie Wright (1) .\n\nThis  General  Shareholders'  Meeting  will  also  be  called  upon to  ratify  the  co-options  of  B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte  Chr\u00e9tien,  G\u00e9rald Gr\u00e9goire and Christine Grillet.\n\n## 2.1.1.1.4 The directors appointed by the General Shareholders' Meeting\n\nDiversity Policy of the Board: In accordance with its diversity policy, the Board of Directors ensures the collective balance and plurality of skills of the members comprising it, in view of the  challenges  Amundi  faces.  It  maintains  a  diversity  of backgrounds  and  gender,  while  ensuring  that  all  members are committed to the company's core values.\n\nPlurality  of  skills: Each  director  self-assesses  the  skills  that are  specific  to  themselves  and  which  appear  in  section  2.2 \"Individual presentation of the directors and the non-voting member.\"\n\nIn  addition,  it  is  recalled  that, in  accordance  with  banking regulations, each director is subject to a thorough review of their  profile  by  the  ECB (European  Central  Bank)  upon appointment.  The  good  repute,  availability  and  skills  are therefore carefully analysed beforehand by the Appointment Committee,  so  that  the  individual  skills  of  the  selected candidate correspond to the collective need of the Board.\n\nTo  identify  the  expertise  that  the  Board  needs  to  function properly,  the  Appointment  Committee  first  brought  in  the knowledge  and  experience  recommended  by  the  European banking authorities, and has added an ongoing requirement for  skills  in  the  fields  of  asset  management  and  social  and environmental issues. It has therefore defined a target matrix in line with its needs.\n\nThe Appointment Committee strives to preserve this overall balance  as  it  analyses  and  recommends  candidates  to  the Board. To this end, it ensures that each of the themes in the skills  matrix  retains  a  satisfactory  level  of  representation.  It also  assesses  the  development  of  the  skills  of  directors already in office through training sessions organised by the Company. Following its recommendations, the Board sought in particular to consolidate its level of expertise in the field of  ESG  and  more  specifically  in  climate,  energy  transition, biodiversity and social relations, as well as in the field of IT and digital, in particular in the field of cybersecurity.\n\nThus,  in  2023,  the  two  training  sessions,  the  strategic seminar, and the appointments and renewals made within the Board  and  its  committees  made  it  possible  to  further strengthen the collective competence of the Amundi Board of Directors in these areas.\n\nIn  general,  as  presented  in  the  skills  matrix  below,  each expertise  is  increasingly  represented  on  the  Board,  which makes  it  possible  to  consider  the  Board's  collective competence  as balanced  and adapted  to  the  current  and future needs of the Company.\n\nIt  should  be  noted  that  a  majority  of  the  members  of  the Board  of  Directors considered that the \"Social and Environmental Issues\"  expertise  was  the  one,  or  one  of  the areas,  on  which  they  had  made  progress  in  2023.  Their respective  skills  are  also  relatively  balanced  on  each  of  the themes E (Environment), S (Sustainability) and G (Governance)  that  this  expertise  covers,  it  being  specified that:\n\n- \u00b7 expertise  in  governance  continues  to  be  strong,  in particular insofar as it is firmly anchored in the culture of the banking sector;\n- \u00b7 social competence has been strengthened, in particular by the arrival of B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte Chr\u00e9tien, who provides a specific perspective on the subject; and\n- \u00b7 in  terms  of  the  environment,  the  directors  continued  to develop  their  climate  skills  during  the  financial  year,  in accordance  with  the  commitments  made  as  part  of  the \"Say On Climate.\" During their strategic seminar, they were led  to  reflect  on  the Net  Zero framework  and  its deployment  within  Amundi's  Responsible  Investment strategy.  To  deepen  their  knowledge  of  environmental issues,  at  the  end  of  the  year,  they  also  benefited  from specific training on issues related to nature and biodiversity.",

for more details on each of the themes covered by the notion of social and environmental issues\n\nPlurality of cultures: the  Board of Directors' diversity policy seeks, through the profile of each of its members (presented in the \"Individual presentation of the directors and the nonvoting  member\"  of  section  2.2),  to  ensure a  diversity  of cultures, in line with the needs of the Company.\n\nAlthough all members are French nationals, several of them have  a  real  international  culture  or  professional  experience, especially in Asian and European areas, perfectly in line with Amundi's development strategy. For example, Virginie Cayatte is Chief Financial Officer of a major Chinese listed player, BlueStar Adisseo Company Ltd. Nathalie Wright has worked for a large US company, so she strengthens the Board's culture in this area. It should be noted that although the  Board  already  has  real  skills  in  international  matters,  it follows from the evaluation made in 2023 of the functioning of the Board  of  Directors  and  its  committees,  that the  strengthening  of  these  skills  remains  a  desired  area  for improvement.\n\nThe four directors,  as  well  as  the  observer,  from  the  Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Regional Banks add a local and regional culture.\n\nFor more details, with regard to the profiles of each of the members of the Amundi Board, see section 2.2.\n\nThis  diversity  policy  also  incorporates  a gender  balance policy in the composition of the Board and its Committees.\n\nThe Board has set itself the objective of maintaining at least a gender equality rate of 50% men and 50% women within the Board.\n\nIn a context where the Board of Directors seeks to favour the profile,  rather  than  gender,  of  the  directors,  the percentage of  women  present  on  the  Board  improved  further  in  2023 (58.33%) (1) , while remaining in compliance with the applicable French  legal  requirements.  The  Board  now  includes seven women .\n\nIn addition,  the  membership  of  each  of  the  Board's specialised committees includes at least one woman and two of  the  committees  are  chaired  by  women.  There  was  an increase  in  representation  of  women  in  2023,  in  the Appointment Committee, the Compensation Committee and the Strategy and CSR Committee.\n\nThe desire for balanced representation of women and men is also  reflected  in  the  Company's  internal  organisation  ( see section 2.3.4 - The Group's Management Bodies). The gender equality policy, and specifically the objectives of this policy, the  methods  of  implementation  and  the  results  achieved during the past financial year, are discussed each year by the Board of Directors when  reviewing the Report on Professional  Equality,  after  an  in-depth  analysis  conducted by the Compensation Committee.\n\nHolding  of  shares: In  accordance  with  Article  10  of  the Articles of Association and the AFEP-MEDEF  Code (corporate governance code of reference for publicly traded companies), each  director  must  hold  at  least  200  shares during their term of office.\n\n2\n\n<!-- image -->",

In the light of the results for the 2023 financial  year,  since  no  financial  flows  greater  than  this amount, nor any qualitative element likely to be of concern, were identified, the Committee considered that there was no commitment  constituting  a  situation  of  dependence  or generating conflicts of interest.\n\nThus,  at  its  meeting  of  6  February  2024,  the  Board  of Directors  was  able  to  rely  on  the  work  of  its  Appointment Committee  to  consider Virginie  Cayatte,  Laurence  DanonArnaud,  Robert  Leblanc,  H\u00e9l\u00e8ne  Molinari  and  Nathalie Wright as meeting all the criteria required to be qualified as independent  members  under  the  AFEP-MEDEF  Code.  This shows a percentage of 41.67% of independent directors (1)(2) .\n\nNote  that  the  Board  of  Directors  refers  to  the  following  eight  criteria  as  stipulated  by  Article  10  of  the  AFEP-MEDEF  Code presented below:\n\n## Summary of Article 10.5 of the AFEP-MEDEF Code:\n\nCriterion  1. Employee or company officer in the last  five years: Not to be or have been in the last five years:\n\n- \u00b7 an  employee  or  executive  company  officer  of  the Company;\n- \u00b7 an employee, executive company officer or director of a company consolidated by the Company;\n- \u00b7 employee, executive company officer or director of the parent  company  of  the  Company  or  of  a  company consolidated by this parent company.\n\nCriteria No. 2. Directorships in other companies: not be an executive  company  officer  of  a  company  in  which  the Company directly or indirectly holds a mandate as director or in which an employee appointed as such or an executive company officer of the Company (current or having been for less than five years) holds a mandate as director.\n\nCriteria No. 3. Significant business relationships: not be a client,  supplier,  investment  banker,  financing  banker (3) , significant  adviser  to  the  Company  or  its  Group,  or  for which  the  Company  or  its  Group  represents  a  significant share  of  the  activity.  The  evaluation  of  the  significant  or non-significant relationship with the Company or its Group must be debated by the Board, and the quantitative  and qualitative  criteria  that  led  to  the  evaluation  (continuity, economic dependence, exclusivity etc.) must be explicitly stated in the report on corporate governance.\n\nCriteria  No.  4. Family  tie: not  having  a  close  family relationship with a company officer.\n\nCriteria  No.  5. Statutory  Auditor: not  having  been  an auditor of the company during the previous 5 years.\n\nCriteria  No.  6. Mandate  greater  than  12  years: not  be  a director of the Company for more than 12 years. The loss of the  status  of  independent  director  occurs  on  the  12-year anniversary date.\n\nCriteria No. 7. Status of non-executive company officer: a non-executive  company  officer  cannot  be  considered independent if they receive variable compensation in cash or securities or any compensation  related to the performance of the Company or the Group.\n\nCriteria  No.  8. Status  of  the  significant  shareholder: Directors  representing  significant  shareholders  of  the Company  or  its  parent  company  may  be  considered independent  as  long  as  these  shareholders  do  not participate in the control of the Company. However, above a  10%  threshold  of  capital  or  voting  rights,  the  Board,  on the  basis  of  a  report  from  the  Appointment  Committee, shall  systematically  query  whether  the  person  can  be considered  as  independent,  taking  into  account  the composition of the Company's capital and the existence of any potential conflict of interest.",

Amundi is therefore exempt from the AFEP-MEDEF Code requirements on this point.\n\nNevertheless,  the  Board  of  Directors  wished  to  use  the optional  regime  set  out  in  Article  L.  225-27  of  the  French Commercial Code, under which a director may be elected by the  Company's  employees,  if  permitted  by  the  Company's Bylaws. Since the General Shareholders' Meeting of 2016 that approved  the  amendment  to  the  Bylaws  to  this  end,  the Board  includes  a  director  elected  by  the  employees.  The aforementioned  article  also  states  that  the  director  elected by  the  employees  should  not  be  taken  into  account  when applying  the  rules  relating  to  the  requirement  for  gender balance under Article L. 225-18-1 of the same Code.\n\nIt  is  recalled that Joseph Ouedraogo, Risk Project Manager, was  elected  on  25  March  2022  as  director  chosen  by  the employees  of  Amundi's  social  and  economic  unit  (UESUnit\u00e9  \u00e9conomique  et  sociale) and  has  been  on  the  Board since that date. Like its predecessors, the Board of Directors awarded  to  Joseph  Ouedraogo  the  time  and  resources necessary  for  the  preparation  of  the  company  director's certificate  dispensed  by  the  IFA-Sciences  Po  that  he obtained during the financial year.\n\n## 2.1.1.1.6 Non-voting member\n\nOn 27 July 2023, the Board of Directors appointed Nicolas Maur\u00e9 , President of the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Toulouse 31 Regional Bank, as non-voting member, to replace Jean-Michel Forest, who  was  called  to  retire.  At  47  years  old,  Nicolas  Maur\u00e9 shows a clear appetite for innovation, new technologies and renewable energies, which are valuable assets for the work of the Board.\n\nUnder the Bylaws, the observer, nominated by the Board, is invited  to  attend  meetings  of  the  Board  of  Directors  and, where  applicable,  Committee  meetings  in  a  consultative capacity. In this way, observer fulfil his role as advisor to the Board of Directors and may give advice and recommendations.\n\nIt  is  specified that the observer is considered a full member of  the  Board  and,  as  such,  complies  with  all  the  charters applicable  to  directors  (Stock  Market  Ethics  Charter  and Directors' Charter).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2\n\n<!-- image -->",

They refrain from participating in the discussions and taking decisions on the subjects concerned.\n\nHowever,  it  is  recalled  that  a  certain  number  of  directors were appointed in their own name on the proposal of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole  S.A.,  the  majority  shareholder:  Philippe  Brassac, B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte Chr\u00e9tien,  Patrice  Genti\u00e9,  Christine  Grillet,  Mich\u00e8le Guibert, Christian Rouchon, Michel Mathieu and his successor G\u00e9rald Gr\u00e9goire.\n\nAt  the  date  of  registration  of  this  Universal  Registration Document,  there  are  no  restrictions  accepted  by  the members of the Board of Directors, or the members of the Senior Management of the Company concerning the sale of their holdings in the share capital of the Company, with the exception  of:  (i)  rules  to  prevent  insider  trading  and  (ii) recommendations  of  the  AFEP-MEDEF  Code  obliging directors to hold shares (except the director elected by the employees),  translated  as  the  requirement  to  hold  200 shares set out in Article 10 of the Articles of Association.\n\nFinally, no service agreement has been signed that binds any members of the administrative or management bodies to the issuer or any of its subsidiaries, and providing benefits at its conclusion, with the exception of the suspension agreements for  two  executive  company  officers'  employment  contracts, described in section 2.1.1.4.\n\nUntil 12 May 2023, Yves Perrier, as Chairman of the Board of Directors, was likely to find himself in a potential conflict of interest situation due to his former duties as Chief Executive Officer of the Company. Until that date, the Risk Committee was  therefore  specifically  responsible  for  monitoring  this particular  situation  and  ensuring  compliance  with  the  rules adopted in terms of managing conflicts of interest. These are identical  to  the  rules  applicable  to  any  director  and  are mainly  contained  in  the  Company's  Directors'  Charter,  as follows:\n\nThe director refrains from using for their personal benefit or for  the  benefit  of  whomsoever  the  inside  information  to which  they  have  access.  The  director  shall  refrain  from carrying out\n\nany  transaction  on  the  Amundi  security  during  the  30 calendar days preceding the publication of the annual and half-yearly  results,  and  during  the  15  calendar  days preceding  the  publication  of  the  quarterly  financial information, as well as on the day of said publications.\n\nThe director must, in application of the Market in Financial Instruments  Directive  (MiFID  II),  declare  any  personal transaction  on  a  financial  instrument  if  they  consider  that they potentially are in a situation of conflicts of interest or if they hold confidential information likely to be considered as inside information and acquired in relation to their duties as director.",

        "page_content": "## 2.1.1.3 Role and functioning of the Board of Directors\n\nThe  role  of  the  Board  is  that  of  a  Board  of  Directors  of  a French  limited  company  governed  by  French  law:  in accordance with Article L 225-35 of the French Commercial Code, it \" determines the strategies of the company's business and  ensures  their  implementation,  in  accordance  with  its corporate  interest,  considering  the  social,  environmental, cultural  and  sports  issues  of  its  activity.  [...]  Subject  to  the powers  expressly  granted  to  shareholders'  meetings  and within  the  limit  of  the  corporate  purpose,  it  considers  any matter concerning the smooth running of the company and takes decisions on the business concerning it. \"\n\nThe tasks and operation of the Board of Directors are set out in  the  Board's  internal  rules  and  in  the  Bylaws,  more specifically  Articles  12  to  14  of  the  Bylaws,  as  well  as Articles 2 to 4 of the internal rules, which are set out in full in Chapter 8 of this Universal Registration Document.\n\nInternal  Rules: the  Internal  Rules  of  the  Board  of  Directors are  also  available  on  the  Company's  website:  https:// about.amundi.com/our-group - see 'THE GOVERNANCE'.\n\nThey consist of five main sections related to the powers of the  Chairman  of  the  Board  of  Directors,  the  powers  of  the Board and of the Chief Executive Officer and of any deputy chief executive officers, the functioning of the Board, and to its specialised committees.\n\nTwo  Charters  (Directors'  Charter  and  Stock  Market  Ethics Charter) are appended to the Internal Rules. All directors and observers are required to accept these regulations individually when taking office.\n\nDuring  its  meeting  of  7  February  2023,  the  Board  of Directors  updated  its  internal  rules  to  take  account  of changes to the duties of the Board and its Committees in the area  of  social  and  environmental  responsibility  and  climate issues, in accordance with its practices and the updating of the AFEP-MEDEF Code.\n\nFrom  now  on,  social  and  environmental  issues  have  been incorporated  into  the  specific  missions  of  each  Committee (for more  details,  see  section  2.1.3  'Overview  of  the specialised committees and their activities in 2023').\n\nDuration  and  allocation  of  mandates: in  accordance  with recommendation  15.2  of  the  AFEP-MEDEF  Code,  the mandates  of  directors  with  a  duration  of  three  years  are properly  spread  out  over  time.  Each  year,  the  mandate  of four directors expires, allowing for the renewal of the entire Board over time.\n\nTraining  /  Seminar: Traditionally,  directors  are  offered  the opportunity to participate in two training sessions during the year,  organised to improve both their knowledge and skills, and  to  allow  them  to  deepen  their  understanding  of  the Company's business and strategic issues.\n\nIn  this  context,  and  in  accordance  with  the  commitments made in connection with the \" Say on Climate ,' the members of the Board benefit each year from training in climate issues. In particular, during their strategic seminar, they were led to reflect on the Net Zero framework and its implementation as part  of  Amundi's  Responsible  Investment  strategy.  To deepen their knowledge of environmental issues, at the end of  the  year,  they  also  benefited  from  specific  training  on issues related to nature and biodiversity.\n\nFor the rest, the topics change each year, according to the regulatory news, the evolution of the Company's business, or the needs expressed by the members of the Board.\n\nDuring the last financial year closed, the directors significantly  strengthened  their  knowledge  of  the  economic and  financial  prospects,  at  the  macroeconomic  level,  in  the specific  context  of  the  year  2023.  They  also  strengthened their knowledge of the Group through a presentation of the Spanish  management  company  Sabadell  AM,  which  joined the group in 2020.\n\nThey  were  also  made  aware  of  the  European  strategy  for retail investment, as well as the financial security framework for international sanctions.\n\nIn  terms  of  IT,  training  was  provided  on  the  topic  of  cyber security  and  resilience.  Finally,  the  directors  were  given  a demonstration on the ALTO platform.\n\nNathalie  Wright  was  also  able  to  benefit  from  the  annual training session organised throughout Cr\u00e9dit Agricole group for all new directors.\n\nMeetings  without  the  presence  of  the  Executive  Company Officers: during  the  two  training  sessions  organised  during 2023, the directors were able to meet without the presence of  the  Executive  Company  Officers.  The  following  persons were present at these meetings: Virginie Cayatte, B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte Chr\u00e9tien,  Laurence  Danon-Arnaud,  Patrice  Genti\u00e9,  Mich\u00e8le Guibert,  Robert  Leblanc,  Nicolas  Maur\u00e9,  H\u00e9l\u00e8ne  Molinari, Christian Rouchon, Joseph Ouedraogo and Nathalie Wright.\n\nIn  addition,  as  every  year,  the  members  of  the  Audit Committee exchanged with the Statutory Auditors,  without the presence of the Executive Company Officers, at the end of their meeting on the 2022 financial statements.\n\nEvaluations: In  December  2023,  the  Board  carried  out two formal  self-assessments at  the  initiative  of  the  Appointment Committee,  in  accordance  with  the  recommendations  of  the AFEP-MEDEF  Code.  One  concerns  the  functioning  of  the Board  and  its specialised committees  (collective selfassessment)  and  the  second  concerns  an  individual  selfassessment  of  skills,  supplemented,  as  every  year,  by  an individual statement from each director. All assessments take the form of online questionnaires.\n\nThe  responses  to the  assessment  which  focuses  on  the collective  functioning of  the  Board  and  its  specialised committees remain strictly anonymous to  preserve freedom of expression. This assessment measures the effectiveness of the Board's operation, its composition and its organisation. In 2023,  each  director  thus  gave  their  assessment  on  the preparation and the progress of the work of the Board and its specialised committees through, in particular, an assessment of the frequency and the quality of the meetings and their  supports.  They  also  commented  on  the  quality  of the training sessions and also on the quality and completeness of the documents, as well as the time awarded to the discussions. The summary,  prepared  by  the Appointment Committee, and presented to the Board, shows an  overall  satisfaction  rate  with  a  very  slight  improvement compared to the previous year (99.01% vs 98.47%). However, the average rate of \"very satisfactory\" responses (77.71%) is slightly lower than last year (78.78%).\n\n2\n\n<!-- image -->",

They  also continue to praise the availability and quality of the Board's Secretariat  teams,  as  well  as  the  reception  and  the environment,  as  well  as  the  duration  and  frequency  of  the meetings. The score on the composition and diversity of the Board  increased  significantly  (77%  vs.  62%  in  2022), particularly following recent appointments.\n\nThe  continued  strengthening  of  the  Board's  international skills  remains  a  desired  area  for  improvement,  as  well  as better diversification in terms of generations in the medium and long term.\n\nThe self-assessment and the individual declaration, completed by each member of the Board, relate to their skills and  possible  training  needs,  but  also  their  availability, independence, identification of potential conflicts of interest, good repute and compliance with ethical rules. The individual feedback allows the Appointment Committee to support its analysis concerning the collective competence of the Board and  the  effective  contribution  of  each  of  its  members\n\n( see \"Individual  presentation  of  the  directors  and  the  nonvoting  member\"  in  section  2.2  below  and  the  paragraph relating  to  \"Skills\"  in  section  2.1.1.1.4  above).  The  feedback from  each  member  also  makes  it  possible  to  refine  the training programmes according to the needs identified.\n\nSuccession  plan: the  procedure  relating  to  the  plan  for succession  of  the  company  officers,  Executive  Company Officers and holders of key positions had been updated during the  2021  financial  year,  in  particular  to  take  into  account  a regulatory change. Since then, any proposed dismissal of the Heads  of  Risk  Management,  Compliance  and  Internal  Audit functions,  representatives  of  key  positions,  is  now  subject  to the  prior  approval  of  the  Board.  It  should  be  noted  that  this succession  planning  procedure  provides  for  actions  by  the Appointment Committee that depend on whether or not the company officer to be recruited is independent. No update to this procedure was  deemed  necessary  in  2023.  The Appointments  Committee  of  1 February  2024  confirmed  the robustness  of  the  system  for  replacement  of  executive company officers.\n\n## 2.1.1.4 Reference and Compliance with a Corporate Governance Code\n\nThe Company refers to the Corporate Governance Code for Listed  Companies,  published  by  AFEP  and  MEDEF  (the 'AFEP-MEDEF  Code'  as  updated  in  December  2022).  The Code can be viewed at www.afep.com or www.medef.com. The  Company  complies  with  all  the  recommendations  in this Code.\n\nAt  the  end  of  the  2023  financial  year,  and  after  in-depth analysis, it was found that the recommendations of the Code were respected , including, under Article 5 thereof relating to the consideration of Social and Environmental Responsibility issues in the missions of the Board .  However, it seems useful to provide a clarification for the 2023 financial year:\n\n## ARTICLE 23\n\n## TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT CONTRACTS FOR COMPANY OFFICERS\n\n'It is recommended, when an employee becomes an executive company officer, to terminate the employment contract that binds them to the Company or to a Group company, either by contractual termination or by resignation \"\n\nArticle  23  of  the  AFEP-MEDEF  Code,  as  interpreted  by  the  High  Committee  on  Corporate Governance  in  its  application  guide,  recommends  outright  termination  of  the  employment contract when an employee becomes an Executive Corporate Officer.\n\nIt  should be noted that in 2022, the General Shareholders' Meeting approved the agreement previously  approved  by  the  Board  of  Directors,  providing  for  the  suspension  of  Val\u00e9rie Baudson's employment contract. In accordance with the doctrine of the Autorit\u00e9 des march\u00e9s financiers (French Financial Markets Authority, AMF) and the Haut Comit\u00e9 du Gouvernement d'Entreprise (High Committee for Corporate Governance), the Board considered that Val\u00e9rie Baudson's 25-year long service and her personal situation were sufficient grounds to maintain her employment contract, while arranging for its suspension.\n\nAlthough Article 23 of the AFEP-MEDEF Code does not apply to the Deputy Chief Executive Officer  of  a  company  with  a  Board  of  Directors,  it  seems  useful  to  specify  that  the  Board adopted the same approach for Nicolas Calcoen. In 2023, the General Meeting also approved the agreement to suspend the latter's employment contract.\n\nIn  order  to  provide  an  appropriate  framework  for  these  two  situations  from  a  contractual perspective, it is specified that the aforementioned suspension agreements stipulate, for both Val\u00e9rie Baudson and Nicolas Calcoen, that the suspension period will not be taken into account when calculating their length of service. Furthermore, the non-compete commitments set out in  the  suspension  agreements  last  for  a  period  of  12  months  following  the  effective  date  of their termination. The financial consideration for these commitments is set at 50% of the fixed compensation  to  which  Val\u00e9rie  Baudson  or  Nicolas  Calcoen  would  be  entitled  upon reactivating  their  employment  contract.  These  employment  contract  suspensions  still  mean that Val\u00e9rie Baudson and Nicolas Calcoen will not be entitled, during their mandates, to any related  items  of  compensation,  whether  arising  from  their  employment  contracts,  the applicable  contractual  stipulations  or  the  legal  and  regulatory  provisions  in  force.  These officers will therefore only receive compensation in respect of their corporate mandate, in line with the terms and conditions described in section 2.4 of this Universal Registration Document.\n\nLastly,  it  should  also  be  noted  that,  in  the  event  that  their  duties  are  terminated,  under  no circumstances may the total amount of any severance pay and any indemnities that may be paid as a result of terminating their employment contract exceed an amount corresponding to two years' fixed and variable annual compensation.",

The  involvement  of  the  directors  was tangible, the overall attendance rate at 29 meetings / written consultations of the Committees and Boards during the year being 95.77% . The attendance records of each of the directors are given in the summary table set about above.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Strategic guidelines\n\nIn accordance with its 2025 Medium-Term Plan communicated  in  June  2022,  the  Board  of  Directors  paid particular attention in 2023 to monitoring the progress of the various strategic axes that it defined:\n\n- \u00b7 Strengthening  its  leadership  in  asset  management: the Board  focused  in  particular  on  the  progress  of  passive management  activities,  post  acquisition  of  Lyxor,  the deployment  in  France  and  Europe  of  an  innovative  of structured  product  range,  and  the  excellent  development of its business activities in Asia, in a context of stabilisation in China and significant developments in India, through its joint venture SBI FM;\n- \u00b7 Continuing  to  lead  the  way  in  responsible  investment: Amundi  was  one  of  the  first  asset  managers  to  have defined  and  submitted  its  Climate  Strategy  to  its shareholders for their opinion in 2022. In 2023, the Board focused  on  precisely  monitoring  the  progress  of  each indicator  specific  to  Say  On  Climate  during  quarterly updates,  in  accordance  with  its  commitments.  This concrete and precise monitoring allowed it to report on its progress  in  this  area  at  its  2023  General  Meeting.  The resolution  approved  with  98.26%  in  favour  reflects  the Board's desire to ensure total transparency on its progress, with respect to its shareholders and the various players in the  market.  In  addition,  regulatory  developments  in  the field of Responsible Investment, Amundi's  strategic positioning  in  this  unstable  environment,  as  well  as  the management of ESG risks were further developed during the year. Finally, the Board examined the strategic review of its product range in Responsible Investment and noted the first successes of the Net Zero range;\n- \u00b7 Asserting  itself  as  a  leading  provider  of  technology  and services  throughout  the  savings  value  chain:  the  Board focused on following the advances of Amundi Technology, which already offers five ALTO products to more than 50 clients  throughout  the  world.  It  has  thought  about  the actions allowing it to strengthen both its business model , the  comprehensiveness  of  its  range  of  products  and  the means allowing it to achieve that;\n- \u00b7 Pursuing  external  growth  transactions  that  create  value: the  Board  has  worked  on  many  external  growth  or partnership  projects,  with  the  constant  aim  of  generating value  for  the  Company.  Discussions  have  been  initiated and certain projects have already been able to materialise in 2023, such as the strategic partnership established with CACEIS to  accelerate  the  development  of  Fund  Channel, one of the leaders in B2B fund distribution platforms, the acquisition of a stake in AirFund, a digital fund distribution platform,  or  more  recently  the  acquisition  of  the  Swiss company Alpha Associates, specialising in funds of funds and  secondary  activities  for  Private  Equity,  private  debt and  infrastructure.  .  During  its Strategic  Seminar , the Board also improved its knowledge of structural trends in the  asset  management  market  and  ensured  Amundi's proper  positioning  in  this  context.  The  challenges  of  the regulatory developments of Retail Investment Strategy , the monitoring of the relationship with its strategic distribution partners and the developments in Distribution and  Private  Banking,  were  the  other  subjects  that  the Board examined in depth.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2\n\n<!-- image -->",

This is how B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte Chr\u00e9tien , HR Director of the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. group, Nicolas Maur\u00e9 and  Christine  Grillet ,  Presidents  of  Regional  Banks,  joined during the financial year.\n\n## Activity and results\n\nEach  quarter,  the  Board  of  Directors  examined  the  overall evolution of the performance of the products managed by all the management companies of the Amundi Group as well as the evolutions  of  the  net  inflows  of  the  various  client segments .  It  also  closely  monitored the contributions to the results of the joint ventures .\n\n## Risks and internal control\n\nThis year, the Board particularly strengthened its work on internal control  in  the  fields  of cybersecurity, the  situation of property funds and on managing developments in Responsible Investment activities.\n\nIn  addition,  each  quarter,  the  Board  of  Directors  studies  the developments and detailed news of the internal control activity integrating the elements specific to the Compliance, Audit, Risk and IT Security business lines. A presentation was made by the Deputy Chief Executive Officer in charge of the Strategy, Finance and  Control  division  and  the  opinion  of  the  Risk  Management Committee  on  the  various  sensitive  subjects  identified  was transmitted at the meeting by its Chairman.\n\nBeyond the usual topics of preparation for General Shareholders'  Meetings,  the  other  work  of  the  Board  of Directors  in  terms  of  governance  and  compensation,  focused on the following topics in 2023:\n\n- \u00b7 approving  the  principles  of  the  compensation  policy  for financial year 2023, as well as ensuring it complies with the applicable  regulations  in  the  area  of  asset  management and  banking  with  regard  to  the  categories  of  identified staff;\n- \u00b7 the  validation  of  new  performance  share  plans  and  their attributions as part of the compensation campaign;\n- \u00b7 the  compensation  of  company  officers  as  well  as  the allocation  of  compensation  among  the  members  of  the Board;\n- \u00b7 implementing a capital increase reserved for employees;\n- \u00b7 analysing  the  Report  on  gender  pay  equality  and  the progress made in 2023 in the area of gender equality, as well as  recording  the  progress  made  in  relation  to  setting objectives in the Gender equality policy (2) ;\n- \u00b7 the evolution of the internal rules of the Board to integrate CSR issues into its missions and those of its Committees.\n\nIn terms of net income, and in addition to the adoption of the annual  financial statements  and  consolidated  financial statements ,  the  Board  of  Directors  also  examined  the  halfyearly  financial  statements  and  the  quarterly  results  for  the year  2023.  On  each  of  these  occasions  it  heard  from  the Statutory  Auditors,  who  presented  their  findings.  It  also approved the entire financial communication prepared, after taking into account the development proposals put forth by the Audit Committee.\n\nAt  the  end  of  2023,  the  Board  of  Directors  finally  took  a decision  on  the  presentation  of  the 2024  budget and  the Company's 2024-2026 financial trajectory.\n\nThe Board also approves the terms of the annual internal control report  drawn  up  in  the  context  of  banking  regulations  and communicated  to  the  ACPR  [the  French  Authority  responsible for  supervising  banking  and  insurance  undertakings],  as  well  as the  half-year  report  on  internal  control  for  the  majority shareholder.\n\nFinally,  it  decides  each  year  on  the  Short  Declaration  on  Risks and on the ICAAP and ILAAP Declarations (3) ,  in  connection with the requirements of the banking regulations.",

        "page_content": "## Regulated agreements and the procedure for evaluating current agreements\n\nDuring the 2023 financial year, a regulated agreement, within the meaning  of  Article  L.  225-38  of  the  French  Commercial  Code, was concluded (1) .\n\nThe Board of Directors of Amundi, meeting on 27 July 2023, after a  favourable  opinion  from  its  Audit  Committee,  authorised  the conclusion  of  an  agreement  between  Amundi  and  its  parent company  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  S.A.  relating  to  the  operation  of  the VAT Group of which Amundi is a member.\n\nThe  purpose  of  the  Agreement  is  to  establish  a  principle  of equity between the members of the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole VAT group, which  must  result  in  the  establishment  of  a  compensation mechanism  and,  where  appropriate,  a  sharing  of  residual  VAT savings between the members.\n\nFirst of all, the Board of Directors recalled that membership in the VAT  group  allowed  the  Amundi  Group  to  sustain  the  VAT savings, which shall be forfeited, and from which it benefited in its  own  right  because  of  the  grouping  of  resources  that  it  had previously  constituted  (and  which,  in  accordance  with  EU  law, can no longer have effect since 1 January 2023). In addition, the Board of Directors noted that the agreement neutralises for each member entity  the  effects  induced  by  membership  in  the  VAT group  (gains  or  losses  other  than  the  positive  impacts  of  the former pooling of resources of Amundi) and also has the interest, for  Amundi,  of  benefiting  from  a  share  of  the  residual  net  gain that would possibly be realised by the VAT group each year.\n\nPhilippe  Brassac,  Christine  Gandon,  Patrice  Genti\u00e9,  Mich\u00e8le Guibert and Christian Rouchon, considered interested parties, did not take part in the deliberations and the vote.\n\nFurthermore, in accordance with the procedure adopted in 2020 on  assessing  agreements  relating  to  current  transactions  and concluded  under  normal  conditions,  the  Board  of  Directors verified  that  the  Audit  Committee  had  carried  out  the  work necessary  to  implement  it  properly.  It  should  be  remembered that the procedure approved by the Board of Directors is based on the following key principles:\n\n- \u00b7 the  Audit  Committee  is  responsible  for  ensuring  compliance with this procedure;\n- \u00b7 the due diligence to be carried out to perform the evaluation of the agreements is based on criteria determined by the Audit Committee and referring to those established by the National Commission of Statutory Auditors;\n- \u00b7 individuals  who  may  have  a  direct  or  indirect  interest  in  an agreement are excluded from the evaluation process;\n- \u00b7 the Company's Statutory Auditors or the Audit Committee are consulted over legal disputes;\n- \u00b7 finally,  the  Board  of  Directors  shall  oversee  any  work  carried out by the Audit Committee in this regard.\n\n## 2.1.3 Overview of the specialised committees and their activities in 2023\n\nIn accordance with the Company's Bylaws and the applicable banking  regulations,  the  Board  of  Directors  has  set  up five specialised committees to carry out a thorough examination of  certain  specific  issues  falling  within  the  mission  of  the Board  of  Directors.  These  Committees  have no  decisionmaking power . Their task is to study any issue relating to the Company that is submitted to them by the Board or by the Chairman, to carry out preliminary work and prepare for the decisions  by  the  Board  in  the  form  of  reports,  proposals, opinions, information or recommendations.\n\nThe  Committee  members  are  appointed  by  the  Board  of Directors, which may remove them at any time. A member of a Committee may resign his or her functions at any time. All members  of  the  committees  and  anyone  attending  the Committee meetings are bound by professional confidentiality.\n\nThe Chairman of each Committee will call the meetings and validate the meeting agenda or the main purpose, taking into consideration  the  requests  of  members,  and  in  accordance with  the  committee's  powers.  The  Board  of  Directors  may also  make  a  specific  request  to  each  committee  within  the scope of its powers, and may ask the Committee Chairman to call an exceptional meeting on that topic.\n\nEach  Committee  may  meet  by  any  means,  including by means  of  video  or  teleconferencing.  It  may  also  give  its opinion by written consultation.\n\nThe  members  of  each  Committee  must  receive  information sufficiently far in advance of the meeting to enable them to make an informed decision. In order to validly deliberate or give  an  opinion,  at  least  half  of  the  Committees'  members must  be  present.  Opinions  and  recommendations  made  to the Board of Directors are adopted by a majority of members present or represented.\n\nThe  Chairman  of  each  Committee  will  lead  the  discussions and  report  the  Committee's  recommendations,  opinions  or proposals to the Board of Directors.\n\nMinutes  must  be  prepared  and  distributed  to  Committee members following each meeting. The minutes shall state the opinion  of  any  member.  Once  approved,  the  minutes  shall also be made available to all directors.\n\nThe  Committee  may  obtain  the  opinion  of  any  person, including  a  third  party,  who  may  shed  light  on  a  subject being discussed.\n\nIt is specified that the Board pays particular attention to the composition of  its  committees so  that  it complies with the recommendations of the AFEP-MEDEF Code and the banking regulations,  but  also  that  it  allows  a  good  match  between the specific expertise of its members and the skills necessary for each Committee.\n\nThis composition is evaluated annually by the Board and has given rise to changes in 2023. The Board also ensures good coordination  between  the  various  Committees by bringing together  certain  members .  For  instance,  Robert  Leblanc,  a member  of the Audit Committee, liaises with the Compensation  Committee,  which  he  chairs, and the Appointments Committee. Christian Rouchon does the same between  the  Audit  Committee  and  the  Risk  Management Committee,  as  Chairman  of  each  of  them.  Virginie  Cayatte can now link the points seen in the Audit Committee and the Strategy and CSR Committee and Laurence Danon chairs the Strategy  and  CSR  Committee  and  participates  in  the Compensation Committee.\n\nTo  continue  these  efforts  to  create  synergies,  the  Board decided  to  convene,  for  the  first  time,  a Joint  Committee bringing together the members of the Audit Committee and those of the Risk Management Committee in December 2023.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2\n\n<!-- image -->",

Val\u00e9rie Baudson proposed to the Board to appoint Nicolas Calcoen, Head of Finance, Strategy and Public Affairs, as Deputy Chief Executive  Officer.  After  consulting  with  the  Appointment Committee,  the  Board  of  Directors  agreed  to  this  proposal and endorsed it on 28 March 2022.\n\nThere  are  therefore  three  executive  company  officers:  the Chairman of the Board and the two Executive Directors.\n\n## 2.3.1 The Chairman of the Board and his duties\n\nOn 12 May 2023, Philippe Brassac succeeded Yves Perrier as Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Company.\n\nIn fulfilment of his legal duties, the Chairman of the Board of Directors:\n\n- \u00b7 organises and directs the work of the Board and reports to the General Shareholders' Meeting;\n- \u00b7 oversees the proper functioning of the Company's bodies and, in particular, makes sure that the board members are able to carry out their assignments;\n- \u00b7 decides  on  the  Board's  agendas  and  ensures  that  the information  provided  to  the  board  members  allows  them to make an informed decision;\n- \u00b7 encourages and promotes dialogue within the Board;\n- \u00b7 ensures the clarity of the decisions taken by the Board.\n\n## 2.3.2 Executive directors and their powers\n\nIn  2022,  the  Board  of  Directors  decided,  when  Nicolas Calcoen  was  appointed  as  Deputy  Chief  Executive  Officer, the  Board  resolved  to  follow  the  recommendations  of  the Appointment  Committee  and  give  him  identical  powers  to those of the Chief Executive Officer.\n\nVal\u00e9rie  Baudson  and  Nicolas  Calcoen,  who  are  in  post  until the Board decides otherwise, therefore have the powers set out  in  Article  15  of  the  Company's  Articles  of  Association: \"The Chief Executive Officer has the broadest powers to act in  all  circumstances  in  the  name  of  the  Company.    They exercise  these  powers  within  the  limit  of  the  corporate purpose and subject to those powers that the law expressly grants  to  the  shareholders'  meetings  and  the  Board  of Directors.  They  represent  the  Company  in  its  dealings  with third  parties. [...] On  the  proposal  of  the  Chief  Executive Officer,  the  Board  may  appoint  a  maximum  of  one  to  five natural persons to assist the Chief Executive Officer with the title  of  Deputy  Chief  Executive  Officer,  the  scope  and duration of whose powers it determines, it being understood that with regard to third parties the Deputy Chief Executive Officers  have  the  same  powers  as  the  Chief  Executive Officer. \"\n\nPhilippe Brassac has also been a member of the Strategy and CSR  Committee  since  October  2022,  when  he  was appointed a director of the Company.\n\nGiven his duties as Chief Executive Officer of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A., Philippe Brassac was particularly involved in 2023 in the work  carried  out  by  the  Strategy  and  CSR  Committee  and the Board on the strategic files submitted to them, as well as on the work relating to the Company's Climate Strategy.\n\nThe  personal  information  concerning  Philippe  Brassac appears in the following section 2.3.3 relating to \"Individual information relating to the Executive Corporate Officers.\"\n\nIn  accordance  with  the  recommendations  of  the  AFEPMEDEF Code, it is recalled that the Chairman of the Board of Directors, from his appointment as director until the end of his duties, is subject to the obligation to hold a minimum of 200 shares pursuant to Article 10 of the Company's Articles of Association.\n\nThe  Internal  Rules  of  the  Board  of  Directors  (Article  3), however, specify, with regard to the Chief Executive Officer and the Deputy Chief Executive Officer, the need to \"obtain the  prior  agreement  of  the  Board  of  Directors  for  the following operations:\n\n- \u00b7 the establishment, acquisition or disposal of any subsidiaries and investments in France or abroad where the overall investment is over \u20ac100 million;\n- \u00b7 any other investment or divestiture of any kind whatsoever of over \u20ac100 million;\n- \u00b7 any  significant  operation  (including,  but  not  limited  to, external acquisition operations, organic growth operations and internal restructuring operations) outside the Company's announced strategy. \"\n\nIt  is  recalled  that  the  Executive  Directors  are  subject  to  a retention  obligation  of  20%  of  the  performance  shares acquired,  until  the  end  of  their  duties,  under  the  conditions described in sections 2.4.3.3.3 and 2.4.4.4 below.\n\nThe  personal  information  concerning  Val\u00e9rie  Baudson  and Nicolas Calcoen appears in the following section 2.3.3, after that of the Chairman of the Board.",

The Committee meets weekly and is involved in all major  decisions of a commercial, organisational and HR management nature.\n\nAmong  other  things,  this  Committee  coordinates  Amundi's core business lines, balances priorities and makes the Group's major  governance  decisions.  The  members  making  up  this committee  are  presented  to  you  in  chapter  1  (Integrated report) of this Universal Registration Document.\n\n## 2.3.4.2 Diversity and gender equality policy\n\nThe Management Bodies described above are varied in terms of  geographical  and  gender  representation,  thus  enabling  a diversified,  balanced  representation  of  the  entire  Amundi Group.\n\nIn  December,  the  Board  of  Directors  made  sure  that  the Group  had  made  progress  in  2023  in  terms  of  gender equality.\n\nIt noted:\n\n- \u00b7 the  significant  increase  in  gender  diversity  within  the Executive Management Committee to 35.7% compared to 28.6% in 2022;\n- \u00b7 the  result  of  the  actions  carried  out  by  the  Senior Management  since  2021  allowing  the constant  growth in the  percentage  of  women  on  the Executive  Committee . These actions made it possible to reach a rate of 38.1% at the  end  of  December  2023  (compared  to  36.7%  in  2022 and  29.6%  in  2021),  a  level  significantly  higher  than  the average  of  the  executive  committees  of  SBF  120 companies (around 26%); and\n- \u00b7 maintaining  the  percentage  of women  within  the  Senior Leadership Team at 33% .\n\nThese  good  levels  of  gender  diversity  make  it  possible  to contribute to maintaining the high score of 85 points on the Women-Men Equal Pay Index and 34.4% of  women, among senior executives in accordance with the Rixain Law .\n\nIn  addition,  a  larger  Executive  Committee  ensures  the consistent  and  effective  deployment  of  the  strategy  in  all countries  in  which  the  Amundi  Group  is  present.  This Committee, the membership of which includes the Heads of the  key  countries  in  which  Amundi  operates,  monitors business  developments  and  ensures  the  right  balance  is struck  between  the  over-arching  policies  of  the  Amundi Group  and  their  interpretation  and  implementation  at  the local level. Its composition is set out in chapter 1 (see section 1.1 p.48).\n\nThese  two  management  bodies  are  complemented  by  the Senior Leadership Team (SLT), a group that brings together 203  senior  executives  (including  the  members  of  the Executive Committee) spread across the various geographical locations of the Amundi Group.\n\nAware of the significant  progress  made  on  the  subject,  the Board also noted the following commitments made by Senior Management  to  promote  the  gender  equality  policy  within the company:\n\n- \u00b7 continue  the  work  on  variable  compensation  in  actions relating  to  any  gender  disparities  regarding  variable compensation;\n- \u00b7 continue  the  actions  started  in  2023  to  increase  the percentage of women in the Management positions;\n- \u00b7 aim to develop talent pools with a 50/50 gender balance\n- \u00b7 gradually  continue  to  extend  paternity  leave  to  28  days per year in international entities;\n- \u00b7 continue  training,  communication  and  awareness-raising initiatives,  particularly  with  managers,  aimed  at  nondiscrimination and the promotion of diversity.\n\nThe Board of Directors mandated management to continue its  efforts  to  improve  the  company's  Diversity  in  a  broad sense.\n\nIt also maintained the objective of 35% of women within the Senior Leadership Team in 2025 and, in line with the Rixain Law, is on course to attain a minimum of 40% of women on the Executive Committee by 2029 .",

The  compensation policy  promotes,  on  the  one  hand,  a  fair  balance  between performance  and  sound  and  controlled  risk  management and, on the other hand, the development of an increasingly responsible and sustainable investment. It thus contributes to the  sustainability  of  the  Company  in  the  interest  of  all stakeholders: investors, shareholders, clients and employees.\n\nAmundi's  compensation  policy  applies  to  all  Amundi employees, including senior executives, and is based on the principle  of  equal  compensation  between  male  and  female workers  for  the  same  work  or  work  of  the  same  value  in accordance with the European Banking Authority's guidelines of  2  July  2021  and  22  November  2021  on  compensation policy.\n\nEach employee is entitled to all or part of the following items of compensation, depending on the responsibilities held and place of work:\n\n- \u00b7 the fixed compensation rewards the missions, responsibilities  and  ongoing  achievements  as  part  of  the position held by the employees;\n- \u00b7 individual  variable  compensation  values  the  individual contribution to collective performance and is broken down into two parts:\n- \u00b7 the annual bonus recognising individual performance;\n- \u00b7 the  performance  shares  plan  (known  as  LTI)  aimed  at motivating certain executives to achieve the multi-year commercial  and  financial  objectives  and  to  implement Amundi's ESG trajectory;\n- \u00b7 the  collective  variable  compensation  ensures  employees' share in the returns of financial performance generated by Amundi;\n- \u00b7 benefits offer protection to the employee and their family and accompany the employee in preparing for retirement.\n\nThe overall amount of variable compensation is validated by the  Board  of  Directors  after  review  by  the  Compensation Committee and is determined on the basis of a percentage of the Gross Operating Income before variable compensation.\n\nThe  allocation  of  this  overall  amount  within  the  different business  lines  and  entities  is  carried  out  according  to  the contribution of each team to the collective performance.\n\nThe  individual  allocation  of  variable  compensation  items  is discretionary and is based on the management's assessment of individual risk-adjusted performance. To this end, Amundi's variable compensation scheme:\n\n- \u00b7 takes into account, in the allocation of individual bonuses, compliance with risk limits and client interest;\n- \u00b7 foresees objective criteria, both quantitative and qualitative, integrating, depending on the position held, an appropriate time scale (short to long term);\n- \u00b7 sets, for investment managers, quantitative criteria associating  risk  with  performance  (Information  Ratio/ Sharpe Ratio at one, three and five years) (1) ;\n- \u00b7 takes  into  consideration  the  opinion  of  an ad-hoc committee  (whose  composition  is  described  in  2.4.1.3)  in the  allocation  and  final  vestin  of  deferred  variable compensation,  which  makes  it  possible  to  adjust  the variable  compensation  according  to  the  risk  observed ex post .",

The  highest variable compensation amounts are therefore partly deferred  and  spread  over  a  period  of  at  least  three  years. They  are  only  paid  if  the  performance  conditions  are  met and in the absence of excessive risky professional behaviour during this period.\n\n## 2.4.1.2 Integration of ESG criteria and sustainability risk in the compensation policy\n\nAmundi has made responsible investment one of its founding pillars since it was created in 2010. In 2018, Amundi launched a three-year action plan aimed at integrating ESG into 100% of its open funds under active management. On 8  December 2021,  with  the  aim  of  further  strengthening  its commitments,  Amundi  set  up  a  new  Ambitions  ESG  2025 plan.  The  Group's  compensation  policy  is  aligned  with  the responsible  investment  policy  and  with  the  Ambitions  ESG 2025 plan.\n\nCompliance  with  the  responsible  investment  policy  is embedded into Amundi's control framework. Responsibilities are  spread  between the first level of control carried out by the management teams themselves and the second level of control performed by the risk management teams, who can verify that the funds comply with the responsible investment policy on an ongoing basis. ESG rules are monitored by the risk management teams in the same way as other investment management  constraints, using the same tools and procedures.\n\n## 2.4.1.3 Governance\n\nIn order to ensure compliance with the guiding principles of the compensation policy and their application in accordance with the applicable regulations (AIFM / UCITS V, IFD, CRD V, MIFID  and  SFDR),  Amundi  has  set  up  a  governance  of  the compensation policies and practices that concern all Amundi entities.\n\nThe  Human  Resources  Department,  under  the  direct supervision  of  the  Senior  Management,  is  responsible  for implementing the compensation policy.\n\nIn  accordance  with  regulatory  requirements,  permanent control  functions  play  a  role  in  the  process  of  reviewing variable compensation, specifically for 'identified staff'. This applies  primarily  to  the  Risk  Management  Department  and Compliance Department.\n\nAn ad-hoc committee, which brings together the executives of  the  Investment  business  line,  the  Human  Resources Department  and  the  control  functions  (audit,  compliance, risks and security), reviews for the risk takers, the respect of risk limits and compliance procedures put in place.\n\nIn addition to these controls, in accordance with Commitment No. 8 of the Ambitions ESG 2025 plan, Amundi has integrated ESG  criteria in the determination of compensation. Thus:\n\n- \u00b7 the  implementation  of  the  10  commitments  of  the Ambitions ESG 2025 plan accounts for 20% of the criteria supporting the performance shares plan awarded in 2023 to 200 Amundi senior executives;\n- \u00b7 as  of  2022,  Amundi  included  Responsible  Investment objectives in the performance evaluation of sales representatives  and  portfolio  managers,  so  that  the determination of their variable compensation includes this dimension,  as  shown  in  table  2.4.1.1  above.  In  addition,  in 2023, Responsible Investment objectives were also set for marketing teams to ensure consistency with the objectives set for sales teams.\n\nFinally, in 2023, the evaluation of the performance of the Chief Executive  Officer  and  the  Deputy  Chief  Executive  Officer  is based on ESG and CSR objectives up to 20% (considering the criteria relating  to  the  implementation  of  Amundi  ESG projects, accounting for 12.5%, and the Societal and Environmental  CSR  of  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  group,  accounting  for 7.5%).\n\nThese  items  are  referred  to  Senior  Management  and  the managers  concerned  so  that  the  implementation  of  the compensation policy takes them into account.\n\nThe  Amundi  Compensation  Committee,  which  is  composed of  two  thirds  of  independent  directors  and  chaired  by  an independent  director,  met  twice  during  the  2023  financial year.  It  provides  an  opinion  on  the  compensation  policy  to enable the Board of Directors to make informed decisions. It monitors the implementation of this compensation policy in particular for the 'identified staff' referred to below.\n\nEach  year,  Amundi's  Risk  Management  Committee  also ensures  the  compatibility  of  the  compensation  policy  with the Company's economic and prudential situation.\n\nIn addition, the implementation  of  policies  applicable pursuant  to  the  CRD V  and  IFD  regulations  falls  within  the scope of the compensation governance introduced by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A.",

The subscription to this operation named We Share Amundi 2023 was open from 20 to 30 June 2023. This  operation  was  a  success,  with  more  than  one  in  three employees  worldwide  (37.4%)  having  subscribed  to  the operation, with a subscription peak at 57.5% in France. More than  2,100  employees  in  15  countries,  subscribed  to  this capital  increase  for  an  amount  slightly  over  \u20ac30  million,  an increase of 6% compared to the amount subscribed in 2022. Employee  ownership  in  Amundi's  share  capital  represents 1.43% at 31 December 2023.\n\n## Long-term incentive plans\n\nThe General Shareholders' Meeting of 10 May 2021 authorised the Board of Directors to grant performance shares (existing shares or to be issued) to some or all Group employees and executive  company  officers,  subject  to  achieving  certain performance conditions. This authorisation was given for up to 2% of the maximum share capital. For each financial year, the  total  number  of  shares  allocated  to  executive  company officers  may  not  represent  more  than  0.1%  of  the  share capital. Pursuant to this authorisation, the Board of Directors decided  on  the  exact  terms  and  conditions  of  the performance shares plans at its meeting of 7 February 2023 and determined the list of beneficiaries at its meeting of 27 April 2023. Two separate plans have been implemented:\n\n- \u00b7 General 2023 plan: the shares awarded will vest at the end of a three-years vesting period and will be fully subject to the achievement of performance conditions defined by the Board  of  Directors,  the  absence  of  risky  professional behaviour  and  continued  employment  on  the  acquisition date. The number of shares that vest depends on the level of  achievement  of  the  average  budgetary  targets  for  the years 2023, 2024, and 2025 in respect of the adjusted Net Income  Group  Share,  adjusted  cost-to-income  ratio  and adjusted net inflows, as well as the level of implementation of the Ambitions ESG 2025 plan by the end of 2025. Their level  of  achievement  will  be  assessed  over  the  entire length of the plan.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u00b7 Capital  Requirements  Directive  (CRD  V)  2023  Plan: it  is adapted  to  the  deferred  variable  compensation  rules specific  to  the  CRD  V  regulations,  as  provided  for  in  the 26 th resolution  approved  by  the  General  Shareholders' Meeting  of  10  May  2021.  The  shares  awarded  will  vest  in five tranches over five years and will be fully subject to the achievement  of  performance  conditions  defined  by  the Board  of  Directors,  the  absence  of  risky  professional behaviour  and  continued  employment  on  the  acquisition date. The number of shares that vest depends on the level of  achievement  of  the  annual  budgetary  targets  for  the years 2023 to 2027 in respect of the adjusted Net Income Group  Share,  adjusted  cost-to-income  ratio  and  adjusted net inflows, as well as annual progress in the implementation  of  the  Ambitions  ESG 2025  plan  and  the successive  ESG  plan.  Their  level  of  achievement  will  be assessed annually. It is also specified that the shares were awarded to the Executive Company Officers only after the General Meeting of 12 May 2023 which approved the total variable compensation awarded in respect of 2022. These awards are detailed in section 2.4.3.5 in Table 6.\n\nIt  is  also  specified  that no  previously  authorised  long-term incentive plan was delivered during the 2023 financial year .\n\n<!-- image -->",

Thus,  for  the  scope  of  management companies,  the  compensation  policy  applicable  to  all  of Amundi's \"identified staff\" is determined in accordance with the AIFM /UCITS V Directives applicable to them. For certain entities  of  the  Amundi  Group  having  the  status  of  credit institution or investment firm, a limited number of employees are  subject  to  CRD  V  (Capital  Requirements  Directive)  and IFD  (Investment  Firms  Directive)  regulations,  as  defined  in sections 2.4.2.1.2 and 2.4.2.1.3. The banking entities within the Amundi scope are subject to the same compensation policies as  the  banking  entities  of  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  group.  These policies provide for in particular:\n\n- \u00b7 rules and thresholds for deferred compensation in line with CRD V;\n- \u00b7 the indexation of deferred variable compensation according to the principles defined in section 2.4.2.2.2;\n- \u00b7 linking the payment of the deferred bonus to the absence of risky professional behaviour.\n\nThe compensation of \"identified staff' under CRD V whose professional  activities  have  a  significant  impact  on  the  risk profile of the relevant entities for the 2023 financial year, is the subject of an \"Annual Report on the compensation policy and  practices  of  identified  staff  under  CRD  V\"  prepared  in accordance with the applicable regulations and presented in section 2.4.2.3.\n\nThe \"identified staff\" under IFD are subject to specific rules described in section 2.4.2.2.3. A report on the compensation policy and practices for IFD identified staff will be published at the level of each entity to which it applies.\n\n## 2.4.2.1 Scope of 'identified staff' (AIFM / UCITS V, IFD and CRD V)\n\n## 2.4.2.1.1 'Identified staff' under AIFM / UCITS V\n\nThe  compensation  policy  that  applies  to  identified  staff  is aligned  with  Amundi's  general  principles  and  stems  from  a highly controlled regulatory environment that imposes rules on the structure of their compensation.\n\n'Identified  staff'  includes  all  categories  of  employees  who have an impact on their entity's risk profile by virtue of their function, level of authorisation or their compensation, as well as  employees  in  the  control  functions  of  the  entities concerned.\n\n'Identified  staff'  are  designated  through  a  joint  process between the Amundi Group functions (Human Resources and the  Control  functions)  and  its  entities.  This  process  is supervised by the Compensation Committee.\n\nPursuant  to  European  Directives  AIFM  2011/61  of  8  June 2011  and  UCITS  V  2014/91  of  23  July  2014,  the  \"identified staff\" of asset management companies, alternative investment funds (AIF) and UCITS are the employees whose professional  activities  have  a  substantial  impact  on  the  risk profile of the Group's management companies managing AIF or UCITS or on the AIF or UCITS, which covers:\n\n- \u00b7 the  members  of  senior  management  and  the  company Executive Senior Managers;\n- \u00b7 persons in charge of a control function;\n- \u00b7 other risk takers;\n- \u00b7 employees whose  compensation  exceeds  a  certain threshold.\n\n## 2.4.2.1.2 \"Identified staff\" under CRD V\n\nThe CRD regulation applies to the categories of staff whose professional  activities  have  a  significant  impact  on  the  risk profile  of  the  company  having  the  status  of  a  credit institution or a class 1 bis investment firm within the meaning of  Article  L.  531-4  of  the  French  Monetary  and  Financial Code.\n\nAmundi's 'identified staff' within the meaning of CRD V are identified based on the consolidated scope (Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A.)  and  the  sub-consolidated  scope  (Amundi)  under  the joint responsibility of the Human Resources, Risk Management and Compliance departments.\n\nThe  following  are  therefore  defined  as  'identified  staff'  in accordance with the qualitative and quantitative identification criteria established by CRD V:\n\n- \u00b7 the members of the Board of Directors of Amundi S.A.;\n- \u00b7 the Chief Executive Officer and the Deputy Chief Executive Officer, both being Executive Senior Managers of Amundi S.A.;\n- \u00b7 the Chief Executive Officer and the Deputy CEO of Amundi Finance.",

More specifically,  there  are  three  categories  of  investment  firms, defined  in  Article  L.  531-4  of  the  French  Monetary  and Financial Code:\n\n- \u00b7 Class  1  bis  investment  firms,  which  are  subject  to  CRD regulations;\n- \u00b7 Class 2 investment firms, which are defined as opposed to class 1  bis and  class  3  investment  firms  and  which  are subject to the obligations laid down by the IFD regulations;\n- \u00b7 Class  3  investment  firms,  which  are  subject  to  IFD regulation  but  have  an  exemption  from  compensation rules.\n\nIt  is  specified that no investment company belonging to the Amundi  Group  falls  into  the  category  of  Class  1  bis investment companies mentioned in Article L. 531-4 (1) of the French  Monetary  and  Financial  Code,  which  are  subject  to the CRD V regulations.\n\nThe rules that apply to Class 2 investment firms are based on the  rules  provided  for  by  the  AIFM  /  UCITS  and  CRD regulations.  They  include  the  obligation  to  establish  a compensation  policy,  to  set  a  ratio  between  fixed  and variable  compensation,  and  to  make  the  acquisition  of variable compensation  subject  to  the  achievement  of performance conditions.\n\n## 2.4.2.2 Compensation policy for 'Identified Staff' (AIFM / UCITS V, IFD and CRD V)\n\nAmundi's compensation policy aims at ensuring an adjustment of compensation to performance in the mediumto long-term and preventing conflicts of interest.\n\n## 2.4.2.2.1 Deferral rules applicable to variable compensation\n\nAs set out in 2.4.1.1, it is reminded that variable compensation can comprise two  components,  the  bonus  and  the performance  shares  plan  (LTI).  The  characteristics  of  these performance shares plans are given in 2.4.2.2.4.\n\nSubject to the specific provisions set out in 2.4.2.2.2, variable compensation awarded to 'identified staff' is deferred for a minimum of 50% of the amount awarded as of the first euro, by  tranches  over  a  minimum  of  three  years,  as  soon  as  it attains a materiality  threshold  agreed  upon  with  the regulator.\n\n'Identified  staff'  are  also  subject  to  bonus  vesting  and indexation conditions.\n\nEach  deferred  compensation  tranche  only  becomes  vested based  on  performance  conditions,  the  absence  of  risky professional  behaviour  and  continued  employment  on  the vesting date. The non-achievement of these conditions may lead to a decrease, or even a definitive loss of the amount to be vested.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIt is specified  that  Amundi  carried  out  the  necessary verifications  in  order  to  determine  to  what  extent  the  IFD Directive applied taking into account  the  derogation provided for in Article 32 (4) under the conditions mentioned in Article 32 (5) of this same directive. It appears from these verifications  that,  for  the  2023  financial  year,  Investment companies which satisfied the said conditions (and particularly  taking  into  account  the  size  of  their  balance sheet) were eligible to the exemption provided for in Article 32 (4) concerning deferrals, payment in financial instruments and discretionary pension benefits.\n\nIn  accordance  with  the  IFD  regulation,  an  identification process  was  implemented  under  the  responsibility  of  the Human  Resources,  Risk  and  Compliance  functions  within Amundi's Class 2 investment firms in order to draft the list of Amundi's  'identified  staff'  pursuant  to  the  qualitative  and quantitative  identification  criteria  provided  for  by  the European Commission's Delegated Regulation No. 2021/2154 and  Article  533-30  of  the  French  Monetary  and  Financial Code.\n\n'Identified  staff'  are  those  employees  whose  professional activities have a significant impact on the risk profile of the investment firm or the assets it manages:\n\n- \u00b7 the  members  of  senior  management  and  the  company Executive Senior Managers;\n- \u00b7 those  persons  in  charge  of  a  control  function  whose activity is entirely dedicated to the investment firm;\n- \u00b7 other risk takers;\n- \u00b7 employees whose  compensation  exceeds  a  certain threshold.\n\nThe deferred portion of the bonus is indexed on a basket of funds that are representative of the activity of the Group or of  its  entities,  thus  encouraging  the  alignment  of  employee compensation  with  the  Company's  performance  in  the medium-  to  long-term.  The  employees  concerned  are  not authorised  to  use  personal  hedging  strategies  intended  to counteract  the  effects  of  this  indexation  on  the  risk  that  is part of the management of deferred variable compensation.\n\n## 2.4.2.2.2 Specific rules applicable to the variable compensation of \"identified staff\" under the CRD V\n\nThe  variable  compensation  awarded  to  CRD  V  'identified staff' may not exceed 100% of their fixed compensation; this ratio may be increased to a maximum of 200% if the General Shareholders'  Meeting  votes  in  favour.  This  upper  limit  was increased  to  200%  for  Amundi  S.A.  by  the 9 th resolution approved  by  the  General  Shareholders'  Meeting  of  12  May 2016, and for Amundi Finance by the 7 th resolution approved by the General Shareholders' Meeting of 17 May 2022.\n\nThe  variable  compensation  is  deferred  when  it  reaches  the threshold of \u20ac50,000 or when it is greater than one third of the total compensation (1) :\n\n- \u00b7 40% to 60% depending on the level of compensation;\n- \u00b7 for a period of four to five years depending on the level of responsibility.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The non-achievement of these conditions may lead to a decrease, or even a definitive loss of the amount to be vested.\n\nMoreover,  if  it  is  discovered,  within  a  five-year  period  after the delivery of a tranche of deferred variable compensation, either in cash or shares, that a member of 'identified staff' is (i) responsible for or has contributed to significant losses to the  detriment  of  Amundi  or  (ii)  has  engaged  in  particularly risky behaviour, the Group reserves the right to demand the restitution of all or some of the shares already delivered or of the  sums  already  paid  out,  subject  to  the  applicability  of local law.\n\nfact,  apply to members of the Board of Directors insofar as they  do  not  receive  variable  compensation.  The  principles applicable to the compensation of the members of the Board of Directors are described in section 2.4.3.1. of this Universal Registration Document.\n\n## 2.4.2.2.3 Specific rules applicable to the variable compensation of \"identified staff\" under the IFD\n\nAmundi entities subject to IFD must respect a ratio between the  variable  and  fixed  portion  of  the  total  compensation allocated to their employees. This ratio is not set by law. It was set by Amundi at 200%; it may be increased to 300% in certain entities, in line with the local regulator's requirements, and after approval by the Risk and Compliance functions.\n\nIn  addition,  as  explained  in  section  2.4.2.1.3,  certain  rules relating  to  variable  compensation  provided  for  by  the  IFD regulations may not apply in accordance with the exemption provided  for  in  Article  32  (4)(a)  of  the  IFD  Directive. Pursuant  to  the  Group's  compensation  policy,  the  more restrictive  rules  set  out  above  in  2.4.2.1.1  regarding  the deferral  and  payment  of  variable  compensation  in  the  form of instruments apply to IFD 'identified staff'.\n\nIt  should  be  further  noted  that  the  above  principles  on  the variable  compensation  of  CRD  V  identified  staff  do  not,  in\n\n## 2.4.2.2.4 Vesting conditions of the rights attached to performance shares plans\n\nWhen individuals have been awarded performance shares, specific conditions for the vesting of the rights related to these awards are set.

Given  the  approval  rate  of  98.48%  of  the resolution  voted  by  the  General  Shareholders'  Meeting,  the directorship  compensation  awarded  for  the  2022  financial year was paid in June 2023.\n\n## 2.4.3.1.1 Reminder of the general principles of the 2023 policy\n\nThe  compensation  policy  for  Directors  was  drafted  by  the Board  of  Directors  on  the  recommendation  of  and  after review by the Compensation Committee. It was approved by the  2023  Annual  General  Shareholders'  Meeting  at  99.92% (9 th resolution).\n\nIn accordance with Article 22.1 of the AFEP-MEDEF Code, it features  a  predominantly  variable  portion,  according  to  the effective  participation  of  the  directors  in  the  various meetings  of  the  Board  and  its  Committees  (with  the exception of the Chairman of the Board, who is subject to a specific policy, whose principles are described in section 2.4.3.2).\n\nThis  policy  was  deemed  reasonable  in  relation  to  common practice among both SBF 120 companies and the Company's European peers.\n\nAs  a  reminder,  the  maximum  annual  amount  allocated  to Directors was set at \u20ac700,000 at the General Shareholders' Meeting of 30 September 2015 and has not changed since.\n\nDirectors'  compensation for a given year is paid during the following year. As such, the amounts shown below in 2.4.3.1.2 are therefore those:\n\n- \u00b7 allocated for the 2021 financial year and paid in 2022;\n- \u00b7 allocated for the 2022 financial year and paid in 2023; and\n- \u00b7 allocated for the 2023 financial year, to be paid in 2024.\n\nThe compensation policy approved by the General Shareholders' Meeting provides for the following distribution rules for the 2023 financial year:\n\n- \u00b7 an  amount  of  \u20ac3,650  per  director  per  Board  meeting attended;\n- \u00b7 \u20ac2,300 per director per committee meeting attended, up to an annual limit of \u20ac15,000 per Committee;\n- \u00b7 an annual lump-sum of \u20ac15,500, awarded to the Chairman of the Audit Committee;\n- \u00b7 an annual lump-sum of \u20ac15,500, awarded to the Chairman of the Risk Management Committee;\n- \u00b7 an annual lump-sum of \u20ac10,500 awarded to the Chairman of  the  Compensation  Committee,  the  Chairman  of  the Strategic and CSR Committee, and to the Chairman of the Appointment Committee.\n\nThe  non-voting  member  shall  receive  the  same  amount  as the directors, deducted from the annual fixed sum allocated by the General Meeting to the directors.",

This came to an end after the General Shareholders' Meeting of 12 May 2023. Accordingly, the Board of Directors, on the recommendation of the Appointment Committee, approved the following changes to its governance:\n\n- \u00b7 Philippe Brassac, who joined the Board of Directors in October 2022,  succeeded  Yves  Perrier  as  Chairman  following  the General Shareholders' Meeting of 12 May 2023, his co-option as a director having been ratified by the Meeting; and\n- \u00b7 Yves  Perrier  was  appointed  Honorary  Chairman  of  the Company.\n\nThe compensation policy applicable to them was established by the  Board  of  Directors  on  the  basis  of  a  proposal  by  the Compensation Committee. It was approved by the shareholders gathered at the General Shareholders' Meeting on 12 May 2023 by a 99.86% vote in favour (10 th resolution). This policy provides for an annual fixed compensation, to the exclusion of any variable compensation,  in  order  to  guarantee  the  independence  of  the Chairman  of  the  Board  of  Directors  in  the  performance  of  his duties.\n\nThe  amounts  of  compensation  awarded  to  Yves  Perrier  in respect of the period from 1 January 2023 to 12 May 2023, and then  to  Philippe  Brassac  from  12  May  2023,  are  therefore described below.",

The  Board  noted  the  increase  in  total revenues  thanks  in  particular  to  a  good  resistance  of  net management fees excluding performance fees and the increase in  financial  income.  In  addition,  operating  expenses  remained under  control  in  an  inflationary  environment,  benefiting  both from  the  implementation  of  productivity  gains  and  the synergies unlocked by the integration of Lyxor.\n\nThe  Board  determined  the  achievement  rates  shown  in  the table above, by applying to each criterion the payment curve set  at  its  meeting  of  7  February  2023.  This  results  in an overall achievement rate on Amundi's economic objectives of 107.7% on a 100% basis.\n\n## Non-economic criteria - Amundi scope (accounting for 22.5% of the total)\n\nWith  respect  to  the non-economic  criteria  on  the  Amundi scope, on the proposal of the Compensation Committee, the Board  set  the  level  of  achievement  by  taking  into  account the following elements:\n\n## Implement ESG projects (accounting for 12.5% of the total):\n\nGiven the objectives that had been set to the Chief Executive Officer  and  the  Deputy  Chief  Executive  Officer,  the  Board  set the  achievement rate of this objective at 115% .  In  doing  so,  it took  into  account  the  progress,  at  the  end  of  2023,  in  the implementation of the 10 commitments of the Ambitions ESG 2025 plan. In detail, the Board's analysis was as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Three of the ten commitments of the Ambitions ESG 2025 plan (1) that  were  achieved  at  the  end  of  2022  were maintained in 2023:\n- \u00b7 commitment No. 7: Companies that generate over 30% of their activity from unconventional oil and gas sectors were excluded from Amundi's investments in 2023, as was the case in 2022;\n- \u00b7 commitment No. 8: ESG objectives have been integrated into the annual objectives of 99% of portfolio managers and sales representatives  and  the  implementation  of  the  Ambitions ESG 2025 plan accounts for 20% of the criteria supporting the performance shares plan awarded to 200 Amundi senior executives in April 2023. In addition, ESG objectives have also been set for the marketing teams in 2023;\n- \u00b7 commitment No. 10: the progress report documenting the implementation of the climate strategy was presented to shareholders at the General Meeting of 12 May 2023 and approved with 98.26% in favour.\n\n<!-- image -->",

At the  end  of  December  2023,  emissions  decreased  by 57%  per  employee  compared  to  2018,  for  a  target  of - 30% by the end of 2025.\n- \u00b7 Other achievements supporting the Responsible Investment  strategy  were  also  noted  by  the  Board  of Directors:\n- \u00b7 at the end of 2023, more than \u20ac200 billion assets under Net Zero management, reflecting a systematic approach to transforming institutional clients;\n- \u00b7 benchmark successes in terms of responsible management: raising a second transition fund with the World Bank (\u20ac0.5billion) for the transition in emerging countries,  Amundi  won  the  European  Commission's GGBI (Global Green Bond Initiative) call  for  tenders  to launch  the  European  Union's  largest  blended  finance impact programme in the next five years (\u20ac1 billion).\n\n## Amundi's strategic projects (accounting for 10% of the total)\n\nThe  Board  set  the rate  of  achievement  of  this  criterion  at 97% by noting that:\n\n- \u00b7 Development of Amundi Technology and services:\n- \u00b7 several  projects  led  by  strategic  clients  have  been  put into production;\n- \u00b7 ten new external clients signed a contract with Amundi Technology;\n- \u00b7 revenues  continued  to  grow  to  reach  \u20ac60  million,  an increase of +24% compared to 2022;\n- \u00b7 the  percentage  of  recurring  revenues  (licences)  in Amundi Technology's revenues increased in 2023.\n\n- \u00b7 Development of Asia and Europe:\n- \u00b7 in  Asia,  development  continued,  with  net  inflows  of +\u20ac21bn  (excluding  China),  thanks  in  particular  to continued strong growth in India and market stabilisation in China;\n- \u00b7 in  Europe,  Amundi  experienced  strong  growth  in Germany,  with  net  inflows  of  more  than  +\u20ac6bn,  and strengthened its relations with its main partners.\n- \u00b7 Development of real assets and passive management:\n- \u00b7 despite  the  slowdown  in  real  estate  activity  in  2023, Amundi  continued  its progress on real assets in accordance  with  the  strategic  plan,  notably  with  +\u20ac2bn net inflows in net private debt and multi-management and the launch of an infrastructure investment program for the production  of  renewable  energies.  The  year  was  also marked by the progress made in the negotiations for the acquisition of Alpha Associates.\n- \u00b7 on the passive management side, net inflows are +\u20ac17bn (including  +\u20ac13bn  in  ETFs),  the  evolution  of  the  product range  continued  with  the  development  of  ESG  ETF products  (33%  of  the  ETF  range),  Fixed  Income  and  the domiciling of funds in Ireland.\n\n## Economic criteria - Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. scope (accounting for 10% of the total)\n\nWith  regard  to  the economic  objectives  relating  to  the Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  S.A.  scope , on  the  basis  of  the  annual financial statements of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A., the Board noted an overall  achievement  rate  of  123.6%  on  a  100%  basis . Indeed,  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  S.A.  was  able  to  deliver  excellent results for the 2023 financial year. This performance is driven by strong revenue growth in all business divisions, supported by  all  development  projects.  All  financial  indicators  are  in line  or  ahead  of  the  PMT  Ambitions  2025  trajectory.  The achievement rates for each of the indicators are as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 117.5% for Cost-to-income ratio ;\n- \u00b7 128.7% for Net Income Group Share (NIGS) ;\n- \u00b7 124.7% for Return on Tangible Equity (RoTE) ;\n\n## Non-economic criteria - Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. scope (accounting for 7.5% of the total)\n\nWith  regard  to  the  evaluation  of  the Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  S.A. non-economic  criteria ,  relating  to  the  Group's  Societal  and Environmental CSR, the Board adopted an achievement rate of 130%, taking into account the following elements:\n\n## Societal CSR (accounting for 3.75% of the total):\n\n- \u00b7 concerning the objective to promote workforce entry for young  people  through  employment  and  training , the objective is to welcome and support 50,000 young people by  2025,  equivalent  to  12,500  young  people  per  year  for Cr\u00e9dit Agricole group. This annual target was exceeded for 2023,  with  the  Group welcoming more  than  20,000 young people ;\n- \u00b7 regarding the Collective Dynamics target ,  participation in the  Accountability  Index  survey  rose  by  2  points  and reaches  83%,  the  highest  participation  rate  since  the surveys were introduced in 2016.

In  parallel,  a  new travel policy has been published, limiting the use of planes for  journeys  that  are  easily  accessible  by  train,  which  will help to reduce emissions linked to business travel. As at 31 December 2023, emissions were -57% lower than in 2019 .\n\n## 2.4.3.3.2 Determination of the total variable compensation awarded in respect of 2023\n\nAt its meeting of 6 February 2024, on the recommendation of the Compensation Committee, the Board of Directors determined the amount of the total variable compensation awarded to the Chief Executive Officer and the Deputy Chief Executive Officer in respect of the 2023 financial year, by applying the overall achievement rate to the target variable compensation. Thus, the total variable compensation awarded to the Chief Executive Officer and the Deputy Chief Executive Officer is 10.8% higher than the target variable compensation .

This is set at 170% of the fixed compensation, i.e.:\n\n- \u00b7 \u20ac1,496,000 for the Chief Executive Officer;\n- \u00b7 \u20ac714,000 for the Deputy Chief Executive Officer.\n\nThis  maximum  level  is  also  in  line  with  the  application  of Article  L.  511-78  of  the  French  Monetary  and  Financial  Code, which  provides  that  the  General  Shareholders'  Meeting  may increase  the  total  variable  compensation  to  a  maximum  of 200% of the annual fixed compensation, including in the event that objectives are exceeded.\n\n## 2.4.3.3.3 Terms of payment of the total variable compensation\n\nIn accordance with the compensation policy approved by the General  Shareholders'  Meeting  of  12  May  2023,  the  total variable compensation is awarded, up to the target amount:\n\n- \u00b7 for two-thirds of the total, in the form of a cash bonus;\n- \u00b7 for  one-third  of  the  total,  in  the  form  of  performance shares.\n\nBeyond the target amount, the award is made exclusively in the form of a cash bonus.\n\nThe compensation policy also specifies that the deferral and indexing terms applicable to the total variable compensation are implemented in accordance with the CRD V regulations, which stipulate that:\n\n- \u00b7 at least 50% of the total variable compensation is paid in the form of instruments;\n- \u00b7 60% of the total variable compensation is deferred over a five-year period;\n- \u00b7 tranches paid in the form of instruments (indexed cash or performance shares) are subject to a holding period of one year.\n\nThus, pursuant to the above-mentioned provisions, the terms of  payment  of  the  total  variable  compensation  awarded  to the Chief Executive Officer and the Deputy Chief Executive Officer are summarised in the table below. It is recalled that the payment  of  the  variable  compensation  items  is conditional  upon  the  approval  of  the  Annual  General Shareholders'  Meeting  called  to  approve  the  financial statements for the year ending 31 December 2023.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The number of Amundi shares fully vested for each tranche will be determined each year by the Board of Directors, acting on the recommendation of the Compensation Committee, based on the level of achievement of the performance conditions set out in the table below:\n\n## Achievement rate\n\n| Indicator                       | Weighting   | Threshold (0%)           | Target  (100%)            | Upper limit (125%)     |\n|---------------------------------|-------------|--------------------------|---------------------------|------------------------|\n| Adjusted Net Income Group Share | 40%         | < 50% of target amount   | 100% of the target amount | 125% of target amount  |\n| Adjusted cost-to-income ratio   | 20%         | < Target rate + 10 pts   | Target rate               | Target rate - 5 pts    |\n| Adjusted net inflows            | 20%         | < target amount - \u20ac50 bn | 100% of the target amount | Target amount + \u20ac25 bn |\n| ESG & CSR criterion             | 20%         | < 50% of the objective   | 100% of the objective     | 125% of the objective  |\n\nFor the three economic criteria , this achievement rate will be determined  by  comparing  the  result  obtained  with  the annual budget target validated by the Board of Directors (1) .\n\n## With regard to the ESG & CSR criterion :\n\n- \u00b7 for the first two tranches (vesting in 2025 and  2026), each year the Board of Directors will assess Amundi's progress in  the  implementation  of  the  Ambitions  ESG  2025  plan (2) on the basis of quantitative and qualitative criteria;\n- \u00b7 for  the  last  three  tranches  (vesting  in  2027,  2028  and 2029),  the  Ambitions  ESG  2025  Plan  will  have  expired. Therefore, at the end of 2026, 2027 and 2028, the Board of Directors will assess the progress in the implementation of the  ESG  plan  that  will  succeed  the  Ambitions  ESG  2025 Plan. The targets of this new plan will be set by the Board of Directors in 2025.\n\n## For each criterion :\n\n- \u00b7 a trigger threshold is applied below which the achievement rate will be considered as zero;\n- \u00b7 the achievement of the target objective corresponds to an achievement rate of 100%;\n- \u00b7 the  maximum  achievement  rate  used  in  the  event  of outperformance may not exceed 125%.\n\nFor  each  tranche ,  the  overall  performance  is  equal  to  the weighted  average  of  the  achievement  rates  of  each performance condition, this average being capped at 100%. It is recalled  that the  above  conditions  do  not  give entitlement  to  any  additional  compensation.  They  simply specify  the  terms  and  conditions  for  payment  of  the deferred portion of the variable compensation.  The variable compensation  was  already  subject  to  a  performance assessment  by  the  Board  of  Directors and  its  payment remains subject to the ex post vote  of  the  General  Meeting called  to  approve  the  financial  statements  for  the  financial year ended 31 December 2023.\n\nThe number of shares that vest for each tranche will be equal to  one-fifth  of  the  number  of  shares  initially  awarded multiplied by the achievement rate of the concerned tranche.\n\nIt is also recalled that upon appointment of Val\u00e9rie Baudson and  Nicolas  Calcoen,  the  Board  of  Directors  had  set  a requirement to retain, until the end of the office, 20% of the shares acquired. This amount is reviewed annually when the compensation  policy  is  adopted.  In  this  context,  and  in application of the 2023 compensation policy, the Board of 6 February 2024 ,  which  defined  the  terms  of  payment  of  the variable compensation awarded  in respect of 2023, confirmed the obligation for the Chief Executive Officer and the Deputy Chief Executive Officer to retain, until the end of their  office,  for  each  tranche,  20%  of  the  shares  acquired . By  accepting  these  awards,  they  will  also  make  a  formal commitment  not  to  use  any  hedging  or  insurance  strategy until the date of availability of the performance shares.\n\n## Bonus paid in cash\n\nThe  portion  of  deferred  compensation  paid  in  cash  is  paid over  five  years  in  five  equal  tranches.  The  amount  of  each tranche  paid  to  Val\u00e9rie  Baudson  will  be  \u20ac87,507  and  to Nicolas Calcoen \u20ac41,765, rounded to the nearest euro.\n\nThe payment of each tranche is subject to the achievement of performance objectives at the level of Amundi and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A., as set out below.\n\n## It is specified that for each criterion :\n\n- \u00b7 a trigger threshold is applied below which the achievement rate will be considered as zero;\n- \u00b7 the achievement of the target objective corresponds to an achievement rate of 100%;\n- \u00b7 the  maximum  achievement  rate  used  in  the  event  of outperformance may not exceed 120%.\n\nIn addition, for each tranche , the overall performance is equal to  the  weighted  average  of  the  achievement  rates  of  each performance condition, this average being capped at 100%. It is recalled  that the  above  conditions  do  not  give entitlement  to  any  additional  compensation.  They  simply specify  the  terms  and  conditions  for  payment  of  the deferred portion of the variable compensation.  The variable compensation  was  already  subject  to  a  performance assessment  by  the  Board  of  Directors and  its  payment remains subject to the ex post vote  of  the  General  Meeting called  to  approve  the  financial  statements  for  the  financial year ended 31 December 2023.\n\n2\n\n<!-- image -->",

In these cases, the unvested tranches of  deferred  variable  compensation  will  be  paid  on  their normal maturity date pro-rated to the level of achievement of the performance conditions originally set.\n\n## Clawback clause applicable to the deferred portion of total variable compensation\n\nIn addition, in accordance with the compensation policy, if it is  discovered, over a period of five years after delivery of a tranche of deferred compensation, whether in cash or in the form of shares, that the Chief Executive Officer or the Deputy Chief  Executive  Officer:  (i)  is  responsible  for  or  has contributed to significant losses to the detriment of Amundi or (ii) has engaged in particularly serious risky behaviour, the Board of Directors reserves the right to demand the return of all  or  part  of  the  shares  already  delivered  or  the  sums already  paid  out,  subject  to  any  legal  constraints  that  may apply under French law.\n\n## 2.4.3.3.4 Compensation awarded in respect of the 2023 financial year or paid during the same financial year to Val\u00e9rie Baudson, Chief Executive Officer\n\nIn  accordance  with  Article  L.  22-10-34  II  of  the  French Commercial  Code,  the  General  Shareholders'  Meeting  must approve the fixed, variable and exceptional items constituting the total compensation and benefits in kind paid during  the  year  ended  31  December  2023  or  awarded  in respect  of  the  same  financial  year  to  Val\u00e9rie  Baudson,  as Chief Executive Officer. These  items  arise from  the application of the compensation policy of the Chief Executive Officer for the 2023 financial year as approved by 97.09% by the General Shareholders' Meeting of 12 May 2023 in its 11th resolution. These items are detailed in full in the table below.\n\nIt should be noted that Val\u00e9rie Baudson had an employment contract  until  10  May  2021.  As  set  forth  in  2.1.1.4,  an agreement  to  suspend  her  employment  contract  was concluded on 10 May 2021, after authorisation by the Board of Directors under the regulated agreements. In accordance with  the  provisions  of  Article  L.  225-40  of  the  French Commercial Code, this agreement was submitted to the vote and  approved  by  99.99%  of  the  General  Shareholders' Meeting on 18 May 2022 in its 4th resolution.",

The study conducted in  2023  by  McLagan,  on  the  basis  of  the  compensation awarded  in  respect  of  2022,  concludes  that  the  total compensation of the Chief Executive Officer of Amundi is at the  lowest  range  of  the  market.  Indeed,  on  the  basis  of  a panel  of  8  listed  European  asset  managers,  whose  assets under management are, for each, less than \u20ac1,000bn ,  while Amundi manages more than \u20ac2,000bn, the total compensation  for  Val\u00e9rie  Baudson  is 64%  less  than  the median  compensation awarded  to  the  Chief  Executive Officers  of  the  panel.  The  Compensation  Committee  noted that ,  considering  the  compensation  awarded  in  respect  of 2023 , i.e. \u20ac2,342,560, the difference would still be 57% less .\n\nThis  analysis  is  consistent  with  that  of  the  main  proxy advisory  agencies  which  positioned  the  total  compensation of  the  Chief  Executive  Officer  at  a  level  significantly  below the median of the peers they consider representative.\n\nThe positioning of the Chief Executive Officer's compensation in relation to peers is shown below:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 2.4.3.4.2 Legal pay ratios (France)\n\n## Evolution over five years of the pay ratio and the compensation of the position of Chief Executive Officer\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Ratio of remuneration awarded compared to the average remuneration of employees in France\n- After waiver by the Chief Executive Of'cer of 50% of his variable remuneration for 2019 *\n- (1) Study by Willis Towers Watson of June 2023: Compensation of Executives: monitoring and evolution.\n\n<!-- image -->",

By way of illustration, as at 31 December 2023, this workforce represents  2,516  employees,  i.e.  more  than  92%  of  the permanent workforce in France, which is significantly more representative  than  the  workforce  limited  to  the  11 employees of the company Amundi S.A. alone, i.e. 0.4% of the  permanent  workforce  in  France  (for  information purposes, and in strict application of the law, in 2023, the ratio of the compensation awarded to the Chairman of the Board  of  Directors  to  the  average  compensation  of employees in this scope would be equal to 3.5, 23.6 in the case of the compensation awarded to the Chief Executive Officer and 11.2 in the case of the compensation awarded to the Deputy Chief Executive Officer);\n- \u00b7 all  compensation  shown  is  the  compensation  awarded  in respect of the financial years under consideration;\n- \u00b7 the  following  items  were  used  on  a  gross  basis:  fixed compensation,  variable  compensation,  employee  profitsharing, performance shares granted for the financial year in question (awards in 2024 in respect of 2023 subject to the approval of the Board), exceptional bonus. Benefits in kind have been excluded both for the Executive Company Officers  and  for  all  employees  due  to  the  difficulty  of consolidating  this  information  throughout  the  scope. Severance payments, non-compete payments and possible contributions  to  supplementary  pension  schemes  have also been excluded;\n- \u00b7 the performance shares, which form an integral part of the annual variable compensation, are valued at 100% of their award  value (1) . This  method  applies  to  both  Executive Company Officers and employees;\n- \u00b7 the  data  in  respect  of  2022,  which  was  based  on  an estimate  for  employees'  variable  compensation,  was updated with the final amounts.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The compensation  policy  is  consistent  with  Amundi's  corporate interest,  contributes  to  its  sustainability  and  aligns  with  its strategy,  both  from  a  commercial  standpoint  and  as  a responsible investor, as set out in Chapter 1 of this Universal Registration  Document.  To  this  end,  it  complies  with  the general framework described in section 2.4.1, particularly for Executive  Company  Officers,  for  whom  a  variety  of mechanisms such as the indexation of deferred compensation on the Amundi share price evolution promote the alignment of their interests with those of shareholders.\n\nDetailed proposals on the implementation and revision of this policy  are  analysed  by  the  Compensation  Committee.  Two thirds  of  the  members  of  this  committee  are  independent directors  and  it  is  chaired  by  an  independent  director.  The proposals  are  then  discussed  by  the  Board  of  Directors, which  is  responsible  for  drafting  the  compensation  policy. The Board is required to comply with the principles laid down in  the  AFEP-MEDEF  Code  and  the  Company's  Directors' Charter,  particularly  with  regard  to  the  management  of potential  conflicts  of  interest.  These  Board  decisions  relate both to the items of compensation for the past financial year and  to  the  compensation  policy  for  the  upcoming  financial year.  They  take  into  account  the  votes  and  any  opinions expressed  by  the  shareholders  during  the  previous  General Shareholders' Meeting or during regular stakeholder discussions.\n\nThe work of the Board of Directors is based on analyses that enable a comparison to be drawn with the compensation of other executives. For the Chairman of the Board of Directors, the  Board  refers  to  executives  from  SBF  120  listed companies.    For  the  Chief  Executive  Officer,  as  detailed  in 2.3.4.1, it is based on an analysis conducted by the McLagan firm on the basis of a panel of CEOs of eight European listed asset  managers.  As  regards  the  Deputy  Chief  Executive Officer, whose scope of responsibility is specific to Amundi, the  Board uses as a reference a panel of financial directors who also have responsibility for control functions, within the panel  of  European  listed  asset  managers.  The  Board  of Directors  also  takes  into  account  the  compensation  and employment  conditions  of  the  employees  when  taking decisions  regarding  Company  Officers.  In  particular,  it analyses  changes  in  the  Company's  performance  over  the past  five  years,  as  well  as  employees'  average  and  median compensation.\n\nThis  policy  and  the  components of its implementation have been  submitted  to  the  vote  of  the  General  Shareholders' Meeting of the Company since the 2018 financial year.\n\nIn this context, the Company complies with the provisions of the following regulations:\n\n- \u00b7 the regulatory framework set by the French Monetary and Financial  Code  relating  to  the  compensation  of  identified staff, which includes Amundi's Chief Executive Officer and Deputy Chief Executive Officer;\n- \u00b7 the provisions of the French Commercial Code;\n- \u00b7 the  AFEP-MEDEF Corporate Governance Code for Listed Companies (AFEP-MEDEF Code), as revised in December  2022,  and  all  the  guidelines  contained  therein (with  clarifications,  as  the  case  may  be,  from  the  HGCE and/or the AMF).\n\nThe  provisions  of  the  compensation  policy  applicable  to Company Officers,  subject  to  their  approval  by  the  Annual General Shareholders' Meeting called to approve the financial statements  for  the  year  ended  31  December  2023,  are intended to apply to newly appointed Company Officers or those  whose  appointment  is  renewed  after  the  General Shareholders' Meeting, on the understanding that the Board of  Directors,  on  the  recommendation  of  the  Compensation Committee, reserves the right to decide on the adjustments required  to  take  account  of  the  individual  situation  of  the Company  Officer  in  question  and  of  the  responsibilities conferred by their appointment. These items will apply until the next General Shareholders' Meeting called to approve the compensation  policy  for  Company  Officers  in  accordance with Article L. 22-10-8 II of the French Commercial Code.\n\nIn  exceptional circumstances (such as an exceptional change in market conditions or unforeseen changes that substantially affect  the  Company's  business),  the  Board  of  Directors  may allow  an  exception  to  the  application  of  the  compensation policy.  In  accordance  with  Article  L. 22-10-8 III  of  the  French Commercial Code, this exemption must be temporary, in line with  the  corporate  interest,  and  necessary  to  guarantee  the continuity or viability of the Company. The Board of Directors shall  rule,  after  seeking  the  advice  of  the  Compensation Committee and after obtaining any necessary or useful advice if required, in order to decide on the principle and procedures of  this  exception  in  line  with  the  applicable  rules.  The  policy items  to  which  an  exception  may  apply  are,  exclusively,  the variable items allocated to the Chief Executive Officer and/or the Deputy Chief Executive Officer, with the sole objective of taking  into  account,  as  fairly  as  possible,  the  impact  of  the exceptional circumstance in question on the calculation of the quantitative objectives set out in this compensation policy, in compliance with the cap set for total variable compensation. Where  appropriate, the use of this option will be communicated  by  the  Company  and,  in  any  event,  will  be described in the corporate governance report for the financial year in question, along with an explanation of the nature of the exceptional  circumstances  and  an  indication  of  the  items  to which  the  exception  has  been  applied,  in  accordance  with point  10,  section  I  of  Article  L.  22-10-9  of  the  French Commercial Code.",

These policies were approved by the General Meeting of Shareholders of 12 May 2023, as follows:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn addition, the information referred to in Article L. 22-10-9 (I) of the  French  Commercial  Code,  appearing  in  the  report  on corporate  governance,  was  approved  by  98.48%  in  favour (6 th resolution). Additional information was included in the report on  corporate  governance  to  take  into  account  exchanges  with stakeholders  (proxy  advisory  agencies,  shareholders,  investors). Notably  the  details  of  the  comparative  analysis  of  the  Chief Executive Officer's compensation presented in 2.4.3.4.1.\n\n- \u00b7 the  compensation  policies  applicable  to  the  Chairman  of  the Board  of  Directors  (10 th resolution,  approved  by  99.86%  in favour), the members of the Board of Directors (9 th resolution, approved by 99.92% in favour), the Chief Executive Officer (11 th resolution  approved  by  97.09%  in  favour),  the  Deputy  Chief Executive  Officer  (12 th resolution  approved  by  97.76%  in favour).\n\n## 2.4.4.2 Compensation policy applicable to Directors and the Non-voting member\n\nThe  directors'  compensation  policy (1) includes,  on  the  one hand,  elements  common  to  all  the  Company  Officers presented  in  section  2.4.4.1,  and,  on  the  other  hand,  specific elements detailed below.\n\nDirectors are paid exclusively via a fixed annual sum allocated by the General Shareholders' Meeting and distributed by the Board of Directors.\n\nThis  aggregate  amount  was  set  at  \u20ac700,000  at  the  General Shareholders' Meeting of 30 September 2015.\n\nIt is recalled that this compensation is paid in N+1 in respect of the year N. Thus, the compensation policy applicable in 2024 to  the  directors,  subject  to  its  approval  by  the  General Shareholders' Meeting, will give rise to payment of compensation in 2025 in respect of the 2024 financial year.\n\nIt  was proposed by the Board of Directors of 6 February 2024, based  on  the  opinion  of  its  Compensation  Committee,  to maintain  the  same  director  compensation  policy  as  that approved and applied for the 2023 financial year:\n\n- \u00b7 \u20ac3,650 per director per Board meeting attended;\n- \u00b7 \u20ac2,300 per director per committee meeting attended, up to an annual maximum of \u20ac15,000 per committee;\n- \u00b7 an annual lump-sum of \u20ac15,500, allocated to the Chairman of the Audit Committee;\n- \u00b7 an annual lump-sum of \u20ac15,500, allocated to the Chairman of the Risk Management Committee;\n- \u00b7 an annual lump-sum of \u20ac10,500, allocated to the Chairman of the  Compensation  Committee,  the  Chairman  of  the  Strategic and  CSR  Committee  and  the  Chairman  of  the  Appointment Committee.\n\nThis compensation policy is consistent with the compensation of  directors  of  SBF  120  companies (2) and  complies  with Article  22.1  of  the  AFEP-MEDEF  Code,  since  it  comprises  a predominant  variable  portion,  depending  on  the  effective participation  of  the  directors  in  the  various  meetings  of  the Board and its Committees (with the exception of the Chairman of  the  Board,  who  is  the  subject  of  a  specific  policy  whose principles are described in section 2.4.4.3).\n\nThe non-voting member shall receive the same amount as the directors, deducted from the annual fixed sum awarded by the General Meeting to the directors.\n\nIt  is  recalled  that  the  payment  of  the  sum  awarded  to  the directors  as  compensation  for  their  work  may  be  suspended (i)  under  the  second  paragraph  of  Article  L.  225-45  of  the French Commercial Code, when the Board of Directors is not composed in accordance with Article L. 225-18-1 of the same Code, and (ii) under the conditions of Article L. 22-10-34 (I) of the French Commercial Code, when the General Shareholders' Meeting  does  not  approve  the  draft  resolution  on  the information referred to in I of Article L. 22-10-9 of the French Commercial Code.\n\nIn accordance  with  Article L. 22-10-8 II of the French Commercial Code, the following resolution  will  be  submitted to the Annual General Shareholders' Meeting called to approve the  financial  statements  for  the  year  ended  31  December 2023:\n\n## 'Approval of the compensation policy for directors for the 2024 financial year, in application of Article L. 22-10-8 II of the French Commercial Code\n\nThe  General  Shareholders'  Meeting,  making  decisions  under the  quorum  and  majority  conditions  required  for  Ordinary General  Shareholders'  Meetings,  having  taken  note  of  the report of the Board of Directors and the report on corporate governance describing the compensation policy for Company Officers,  approves,  pursuant  to  Article  L.  22-10-8  II  of  the French  Commercial  Code,  the  compensation  policy  for directors  established  by  the  Board  of  Directors  for  the  2024 financial  year,  as  presented  in  the  report  on  corporate governance  contained  in  section  2.4.4.2  of  the  Company's 2023 Universal Registration Document.'\n\n<!-- image -->",

For  each  criterion,  the  target  objective  to  be  achieved  was  set  on  the  basis  of  the  budget approved by the Board of Directors (the values of which are not made public because of their confidentiality). It is specified that the values set out in the budget correspond to the target values.\n\n## Non-economic criteria\n\nThe Amundi non-economic criteria chosen by the Board of Directors are identical to those applicable in 2023 and are aligned with the Company's strategic ambitions for 2025, as presented in the press release of 22 June 2022 (1) ,  on  Investor  Day.  These  strategic  ambitions  include  strengthening  leadership  in  asset  management, continuing to lead the way in responsible investment and establishing the Company as a leading provider of technology and services throughout the savings value chain.\n\nAt  the  end  of  financial  year  2024,  the  Board  will  use  quantitative  and  qualitative  factors  to  evaluate  the achievement of:\n\n- \u00b7 the criterion relating to the implementation of ESG projects, by measuring Amundi's progress, at the end of 2024, in implementing the ten commitments provided for in the Ambitions ESG 2025 plan (as presented in the press release of 8 December 2021), on the basis of quantitative and qualitative results, as was done at the end of 2022 and at the end of 2023;\n- \u00b7 the criterion relating to Amundi's strategic projects based on the results achieved in terms of the development of:\n- \u00b7 Amundi Technology and services,\n- \u00b7 Asia and Europe,\n- \u00b7 Real assets and passive management,\n- \u00b7 The proper implementation of M&A operations.\n\nThe  non-economic  criteria  for  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  S.A.  also  concern  the  Executive  Company  Officers  of  Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. However, the environmental CSR criterion is adapted for Amundi's Executive Company Officers in order to take into account their sphere of influence. Thus, these criteria, identical to those applicable in 2023, are as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Societal CSR: promoting the integration of young people through employment and training (number of young people welcomed into the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole group per year) and developing collective dynamics as measured by the new Accountability Index (Indice de Mise en Responsabilit\u00e9, or IMR);\n- \u00b7 Environmental CSR: improving the carbon footprint of the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole group.\n\nThe Board will assess the level to which these criteria have been fulfilled on the basis of the achievements in 2024.\n\nThus, taking into account the criteria relating to the implementation of the Amundi ESG projects, the societal and  environmental  CSR  of  the  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  group, 20%  of  the  Executive  Company  Officers'  variable compensation is related to CSR and ESG subjects.\n\nIt is specified that in accordance with recommendation 26.1.1 of the AFEP-MEDEF Code, in its revised version in December 2022, within these criteria related to societal and environmental responsibility, several criteria are related to the climate objectives of Amundi and the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole group, accounting for a total of 10% of the variable compensation . These concern commitments numbers 2,6,7,9 and 10 of the Ambitions ESG 2025 plan (i.e. half of the ten commitments) and the improvement of the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole group's carbon footprint.",

It will apply to the entire target total variable compensation, up to the cap of 113.3%.\n\nThe  maximum  total  variable  compensation  will  be  \u20ac1,496,000  for  Val\u00e9rie  Baudson  and  \u20ac714,000  for Nicolas Calcoen, i.e. 113.3% of the target compensation or 170% of the fixed compensation.\n\nTerms and conditions for deferral and indexation of total variable compensation\n\nThe  deferral  and  indexing  procedures  applicable  to  total  variable  compensation  are  defined  in  compliance with the CRD V Directive, which stipulates that:\n\n- \u00b7 50% of the total variable compensation awarded is paid in the form of instruments;\n- \u00b7 60% of the total variable compensation awarded is deferred over a five-year period;\n- \u00b7 tranches paid in the form of instruments (indexed cash or performance shares) are subject to a holding period of one year.\n\nThe  calculation  of  the  compensation  to  be  deferred  in  respect  of  the  financial  year  is  based  on  the  total variable compensation including performance shares awarded in respect of that year.\n\n## Non-deferred portion of total variable compensation, accounting for 40% of the total, paid entirely in cash\n\nThe total variable compensation is, up to 40%, acquired immediately at the time of its allocation by the Board of Directors, subject to the ex-post approval of the General Shareholders' Meeting. This non-deferred portion will be paid in two tranches:\n\n- 1. one half, i.e. 20% of the total, within 15 days after the General Shareholders' Meeting called to approve the financial statements for the year in which this compensation is awarded, i.e. May 2025 for compensation awarded in respect of the 2024 financial year;\n- 2. the  other  half,  i.e.  20%  of  the  total,  will  be  paid  one  year  after  it  is  awarded,  i.e.  in  March  2026  for  the compensation awarded in respect of the 2024 financial year.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\n## Items of the compensation policy\n\n## Total variable compensation:\n\nTerms and conditions of payment\n\n## Overview\n\nThis second portion of variable compensation will be 85% indexed on the Amundi share price evolution and 15% on the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. share price evolution.\n\n## Deferred portion of annual variable compensation, accounting for 60% of the total\n\nThe total variable deferred compensation, accounting for 60% of the total compensation, equals to the sum of:\n\n- \u00b7 the  performance  shares  awarded,  representing  a  maximum  of  one-third  of  the  target  total  variable compensation;\n- \u00b7 the bonus paid in cash for the remainder.\n\n## Performance shares\n\nTo encourage the Executive Company officers to create long-term value and to align their interests with those of  the  Company and its shareholders, a portion of their total variable compensation will be awarded in the form of shares subject to performance conditions. It is specified that in accordance with the 25 th resolution approved by the 2023 General Shareholders' Meeting, the total number of shares awarded to the Executive Company Officers may not represent more than 0.1% of the share capital .\n\n## Number of shares initially granted\n\nThe number of Amundi shares, corresponding to the portion of the variable compensation awarded in respect of 2024 in the form of performance shares, will be determined by the Board of Directors on the basis of the average of the opening prices of the Amundi share during the 40 business days preceding the Board meeting which will award the performance shares in respect of the 2025 plan to a select group of key executives. As these performance shares represent a form of payment of the variable compensation, their effective grant will only  take  place  after  the ex-post vote  of  the  Annual  General  Shareholders'  Meeting  called  to  approve  the financial statements for the 2024 financial year.\n\n## Terms and conditions for performance shares vesting\n\nSubject to the performance conditions being met, these shares will vest in five tranches over five years. Each tranche is subject to a compulsory holding period of one year from the vesting date.\n\nThe number of Amundi shares fully vested for each tranche will be determined each year by the Board of Directors, based on the level of achievement of the performance conditions defined at the time of the initial grant.  These  conditions  will  encompass  the  adjusted  NIGS,  the  adjusted  cost-to-income  ratio,  adjusted  net inflows and criteria reflecting the implementation of Amundi's ESG and CSR policy.  The precise terms and conditions, such as the weighting and vesting scale, will be decided by the Board of Directors at the time of the grant and described in the reports on the compensation granted to the Chief Executive Officer and Deputy Chief Executive Officer for 2024, which will be submitted to the ex-post vote  of  the  General  Shareholders' Meeting called to approve the financial statements for the 2024 financial year.\n\n## Other provisions applicable to performance shares\n\nThe Board of Directors established, at the time of the appointment of the Executive Company Officers, an obligation to retain, until the end of their term of office, 20% of the shares acquired . This amount is reviewed annually  when  the  compensation  policy  concerning  them  is  adopted.  It  is  not  modified  for  the  2024 Compensation Policy. The Chief Executive Officer and the Deputy Chief Executive Officer will also make a formal  commitment  not  to  use  any  hedging  or  insurance  strategy  until  the  date  of  availability  of  the performance shares.\n\n## Bonus paid in cash\n\nThe bonus paid in cash is paid over five years in five equal tranches.\n\n## Terms and conditions for bonus payment\n\nThe payment of each tranche is subject to the achievement of two performance conditions determined by the Company's  Board  of  Directors  on  the  recommendation  of  the  Compensation  Committee. The  overall completion  rate  regarding  these  two  conditions  cannot  exceed  100%. These  conditions  are  weighted  as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 85% on the Amundi Group's adjusted NIGS, with identical terms to those applicable for 2023 (as described in section 2.4.3.3.3);\n- \u00b7 15% on the pre-tax Return on Tangible Equity of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. The condition will be satisfied if the pre-tax Return on Tangible Equity is greater than 5%.\n\nIn the event that the performance shares granted do not represent at least 50% of the compensation to be deferred, then each tranche will be paid partly in cash and partly in the form of indexed cash, 85% of which will be indexed on the Amundi share price evolution, and 15% on the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. share price evolution. The  payment  of  these  tranches  would  also  be  subject  to  a  one-year  holding  period  and  to  the  same performance conditions as for non-indexed cash tranches.\n\n## Payment methods for total variable compensation\n\nThe  payment  of  items  of  variable  compensation  (including  the  effective  grant  of  performance  shares)  is conditional upon their approval by the Annual General Shareholders' Meeting called to approve the financial statements for the year ending 31 December 2024.",

Societal  engagement  is  thus  one  of the four founding pillars of the company. It is based on three convictions:\n\n- \u00b7 economic and financial players bear a social responsibility;\n- \u00b7 incorporating ESG criteria into investment choices provides a source of long-term performance;\n- \u00b7 accelerating  our  ESG  commitments  will  be  our  primary growth driver around the world.\n\nIn  December  2021,  Amundi  presented  its  new  2022-2025 action plan, the Ambitions ESG 2025 plan (details in insert). The plan sets out three objectives:\n\n- \u00b7 increase  the  level  of  ambition  of  its  savings  solutions  in terms of responsible investment;\n- \u00b7 engage as many companies as possible to define credible strategies for aligning with the Net Zero 2050 objective;\n- \u00b7 align  its employees  and  shareholders  with  its  new ambitions.\n\nTo meet these objectives and in line with the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole group's social project, Amundi is committed to:\n\n- \u00b7 acti as a responsible financial institution;\n- \u00b7 act in the interest of clients;\n- \u00b7  act as a responsible employer;\n- \u00b7 and act as an environmentally responsible citizen\n\n## Ambitions ESG 2025 plan\n\n## For its savings and technology solutions offering, Amundi has committed by 2025 to:\n\n- 1. introducing a new environmental transition rating that assesses  companies'  efforts  in  decarbonising  their operations  and  the  development  of  their  sustainable activities, covering \u20ac400 bn of actively manager openended active funds (1) . In order to encourage companies to make this transformation, portfolios will overweight those  companies  that  have  made  the  most  efforts  in their energy transition;\n- 2. Offering  open-ended  funds  in  all  asset  classes  with  a binding Net Zero 2050 investment objective;\n- 3. reaching  \u20ac20bn  in  assets  in  impact  funds  that  will invest  in  companies  that  seek  positive  environmental or  social  performance.  This  impact  will  be  measured and reported annually;\n- 4. ensuring  that  40%  of  its  range  of  passive  funds  is made up of ESG funds;\n- 5. Developing ALTO* (2) Sustainability, a technology analysis  solution  designed  to  support  investors  in decision-making  regarding  the  environmental  and social impact of their portfolio.\n\n## In terms of voting & engagement with companies:\n\n- 6. working  with  1000  additional  companies  to  define credible  strategies  for  reducing  their  greenhouse  gas emissions, to vote at their annual General Shareholders' Meetings and for management remuneration packages to be linked to these strategies;\n- 7. from  2022,  excluding  from  its  portfolios  companies that generate  over  30%  of  their  activity  from unconventional oil and gas production.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAmundi has a dedicated governance to manage its strategy as  a  responsible  investor  and  responsible  company.  This governance operates at two levels:\n\n- \u00b7 supervision  by  the  Board  of  Directors:  the  Board  of Directors relies primarily on the work of the Strategic and CSR  Committee.  Composed  of  two-thirds  independent directors including the Chairman, it formulates an opinion on the company's climate strategy and its policy on social and  environmental  responsibility  and,  at  least  annually,  it review the actions taken by the Group in this area and the results achieved;\n- \u00b7 monitoring  and  management  by  the  Senior  Management: Amundi has committees dedicated to Responsible Investment and CSR chaired by Amundi's Chief Executive Officer:\n- \u00b7 The ESG and Climate Strategy Committee (described in section 3.2.1.2). This Committee meets monthly to define and guide responsible investment actions,\n- \u00b7 the CSR Committee: this Committee, which meets every half  year,  defines  and  guides  Amundi's  responsible actions for its own operations.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\n## Amundi will apply to its own business what it asks of other companies, and has therefore decided to:\n\n- 8. take  into  account  the  level  of  achievement  of  these ESG  objectives  (weight  20%  of  total  criteria)  in  the KPIs  calculation  of  performance  shares  for  our  200 senior executives. We will also set ESG targets for all investment managers and sales representatives;\n- 9. reduce  its  own  direct  greenhouse  gas  emissions  by approximately 30% (vs. 2018) per employee in 2025;\n- 10. present its climate strategy to its shareholders at its Annual General Shareholders' Meeting in 2022.\n\nAmundi's Ambitions ESG 2025 plan is part of the collective mobilisation of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. group for its Societal Project.\n\n## 3.2 ACT AS A RESPONSIBLE FINANCIAL INSTITUTION\n\nA  signatory  of  the Principles  for  Responsible  Investment (PRI)  since  2006,  Amundi  is  one  of  the  pioneers  of responsible investment, which it has placed at the heart of its development strategy. This strategy is based in particular on a  generalisation  of  the  consideration  of  ESG  criteria  in  all open-ended funds actively managed by Amundi (1) , in order to offer  its  clients  investment  solutions  that  seek  to  reconcile financial  performance  and  achievement  of  non-financial objectives while respecting the level of risk they have chosen. After  confirming,  at  the  end  of  2021,  its  position (2) as European  leader  in  responsible  investment  by  finalising  its 2018-2021 ESG  strategic plan, Amundi  announced  in December 2021 that it would further increase its commitments  to  a  just  environmental  transition  through  a new Ambitions ESG 2025 plan.\n\nTo  meet  the  core  challenges  of  responsible  investment, Amundi continues to strengthen its position in six key areas (described in this section):\n\n- \u00b7 dedicated governance to oversee and manage its responsible investment strategy and its implementation;\n- \u00b7 its responsible investment policy to support the transition of the economy towards a more sustainable model;\n- \u00b7 its savings and technology solutions;\n- \u00b7 its system and resources combine a team dedicated to its ESG & Climate commitments and the involvement of all its employees;\n- \u00b7 its commitment  to  stakeholders  within  the  external stakeholder ecosystem;\n- \u00b7 its demand  for  transparency  in  respect  of  all  its stakeholders.\n\nAt its 2022 General Shareholders' Meeting, Amundi submitted  its  Climate  Strategy  to  a  consultative  vote,  a resolution that received 97.7% votes in favour.\n\nIn  addition  to  the  need  for  a  scientific  approach  and  the search for social and economic progress that guarantees an acceptable  energy  transition,  Amundi's  climate  strategy  is based on the conviction that companies must be supported in their transition and that exclusions must be limited to highemission sectors for which viable alternatives exist.\n\nAmundi's  \"Say  on  Climate\"  shows  how  climate  issues  are integrated into the conduct of Amundi's business, demonstrating  its  willingness  to  align  external  and  internal stakeholders  around  a  transparent  climate  strategy.  It  also details  how  Amundi  integrates  the  climate  issue  into  its management activity on behalf of third parties and seeks to accelerate the alignment of its investments with the Net Zero objective  by  2050.  Finally,  it  describes  Amundi's  actions regarding the companies in which it invests, in particular the deployment of ambitious resources in the area of engagement,  in  order  to  support  them  in  their  necessary transformation towards decarbonised development models.\n\nAmundi  will  continue  to  adjust  its  climate  strategy  in  the coming years, according to the scientific reference scenarios and in close connection with its clients'  objectives,  both  by developing investment solutions to accelerate the transition and  by  progressively  aligning  its  portfolios  with  the  2050 neutrality objective.\n\nIn  line  with  the  commitment  made  by  Amundi  in  2023,  the progress made in the implementation of this climate strategy (detailed in this section) will be submitted to the consultative  vote  of  its  shareholders  at  its  2024  General Shareholders' Meeting.\n\nThis  responsible  investment  strategy  complements  our various  internal  measures  to  generate  a  positive  impact  on society  as  a  whole  by  taking  action  on  our  own  operations which  are  included  in  our  approach  on  Corporate  Social Responsibility (CSR).\n\nIn  accordance  with  the  good  practice  of  presenting  the annual progress on implementation of the Climate Strategy, at its 2023 General Shareholders' Meeting Amundi presented an ex post \"Say on Climate\" resolution, detailing the progress made  during  the  2022  financial  year.  This  resolution  was adopted  by  98.26%  of  the  vote.  All  commitments  are  on track for achievement by 2025.",

Amundi  obtained  an  overall  score  of  98%  of favourable  votes  on  the  257  environmental  and  social shareholder resolutions analysed in the report.\n- 3. Majority  Action :  Amundi,  along  with  Franklin  Templeton and LGIM, has distinguished itself by its leadership in using proxy voting to compel directors of companies critical to the transition to net zero to ensure that their operations and business models are aligned with the 1.5\u00b0C trajectories.\n\n## Amundi's commitments\n\n- 4. FollowThis :    Amundi  is  cited  as  \"leader  of  the  world's largest investors in climate management. Amundi was the only  asset  manager  to  consistently  vote  in  favour  of climate resolutions calling for emission reduction targets aligned with those of Paris.\n- 5. Responsible Investment Brand Index (RIBI) : Amundi, in the \"avant-garde\" category, is ranked 8th among nearly 600 asset  managers  worldwide  for  its  ability  to  translate  the commitment to responsible development into its brand.\n- 6.

Global Capital European Securitization Awards :  \"ESG/SRI Investor of the Year\" award won several years in a row (in 2022 and 2023).\n\n## 3.2.1 Governance ensuring the implementation of an ambitious responsible investment strategy\n\n## 3.2.1.1 Supervision of the responsible investment strategy by the Board of Directors\n\nBecause acting as a responsible financial institution is an essential part of Amundi's strategy, its governance structure integrates the challenges of responsible management. The responsibilities related to the achievement of its ESG objectives - in particular climate  objectives  -  are  reflected  in  the  supervisory  and  management  bodies,  as  well  as  in  the  operation  of  the  governance bodies.\n\n## Role of the Board of Directors\n\nThe missions of the Board of Directors relate to the definition of  the  strategic  orientations  of  Amundi's  activity,  while ensuring  their  operational  implementation  by  the  senior management.  The  responsible investment strategy is therefore fully integrated within the scope of its deliberations and decisions. This role is explicitly described in Article 2 of its  Internal  Rules  since  it  \" regularly  reviews,  in  connection with  the  strategy  it  has  defined,  the  opportunities  and  risks such as financial, legal, operational, social and environmental risks as well as the measures taken as a result \".\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors  thus  ensures  that  Amundi  fulfils  its role as a responsible financial player. In 2022, it determined that  Amundi,  as  a  pioneer  in  responsible  investment  and  a committed player on climate issues, should participate in the transparency movement concerning climate strategies, in line with  its  expectations  towards  the  companies  in  which  it invests.  With  this  in  mind,  the  Amundi  Board  of  Directors decided  to  table  a  \"Say  on  Climate\"  resolution  at  its  2022 General Shareholders' Meeting as one of the ten objectives of its  Ambitions ESG 2025 plan. The purpose of this resolution is  to  allow  shareholders  to  vote  on  the  company's  climate strategy  and  to  seek  an  annual  consultative  vote  on  the\n\nprogress  made  in  implementing  this  strategy,  thereby ensuring an ongoing dialogue on environmental issues.\n\nIn accordance with the commitments made in the framework of the climate strategy, the members of the Board participate in an annual training session on climate issues, in addition to the discussions on responsible investment challenges during Board  meetings.  And  as  such,  in  2023,  the  directors continued to deepen their knowledge of climate issues and carbon  neutrality  (\"Net  Zero\")  by  devoting  a  session dedicated  to  this  topic,  during  which  various  experts intervened. At the end of the year, they also benefited from specific training on issues related to nature and biodiversity.\n\nFinally, the Board of Directors monitors the key indicators for measuring  progress  in  the  implementation  of  the  climate strategy.\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors  relies  in  particular  on  the  in-depth work carried out by its specialised committees, as described in  chapter  2,  including  the  Strategic  and  CSR  Committee described  below.  The  other  Committees  (Audit,  etc.)  also each contribute within their scope. For example, a presentation of the main sensitive indicators and the control procedures applied was made during the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors' meeting of 6 February 2023.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Under Article 5.3 of the Internal Rules of the Board  of  Directors,  the  latter's  mission  is  to  deepen  the Group's  strategic  thinking  in  its  various  business  lines,  in France and internationally, as well as in terms of social and environmental  responsibility.  Chaired  by  an  independent director  and  comprising  three  members,  it  formulates  an opinion  on  the  company's  climate  strategy  as  well  as  its social and environmental responsibility policy and examines, at least annually, the actions taken by the Group in this area and the  results  obtained.  At  the  request  of  the  Committee,\n\nthe senior management, the Responsible Investment business line  or  other  ad  hoc  participants  may  be  asked  to  attend some of its meetings. The work and opinions of the Strategic and CSR Committee are reported to the Board of Directors by  the  Chairman  of  the  Committee  or  by  a  member  of  the Committee appointed by the latter.\n\nIn 2023, the Committee was namely called on to assess the report  on  the  progress  of  Amundi's  Climate  and  ESG strategy.  After  noting  that  Amundi  was  in  line  with  the expected  progress,  it  recommended  to  the  Board  of Directors that they adopt the report to be presented to the Meeting accordingly.\n\n## 3.2.1.2 Monitoring and steering of the responsible investment strategy by the Senior Management\n\nFour Committees regularly monitor the work carried out.\n\n## ESG & Climate Strategic Committee\n\nThis Committee meets on a monthly basis and is chaired by the  Chief  Executive  Officer.  It  defines,  validates  and  steers Amundi's  ESG  and  climate  strategy,  as  well  as  the responsible investment policy. More specifically, its mission is to:\n\n- \u00b7 define,  approve  and  monitor  Amundi's  ESG  and  climate strategy;\n- \u00b7 approve  the  main  strategic  guidelines  of  the  responsible investment policy;\n- \u00b7 monitor key strategic projects.\n\n## The ESG Rating Committee\n\nChaired  by  the  Chief  Responsible  Investment  Officer,  this Committee meets every month with the aim to:\n\n- \u00b7 validate Amundi's standard ESG methodology\n- \u00b7 review  exclusion  policies  and  sector-specific  policies  and approve their rules of application;\n- \u00b7 review and decide individual ESG rating issues, and advise on new ESG cases whenever necessary.\n\n## The Voting Committee\n\nThis  Committee  is  chaired  by  the  member  of  executive management in charge of Responsible Investment supervision.  It  is  held  once  a  year  to  approve  the  voting policy, and ad hoc the rest of the year to:\n\n- \u00b7 advise  on  voting  decisions  at  the  General  Shareholders' Meeting for ad hoc cases; members are called upon to give their views in an expert capacity;\n- \u00b7 approve Amundi's voting policy (for the entities covered) and its rules of implementation;\n- \u00b7 approve  specific/local  approaches  that  are  not  directly covered by the voting policy;\n- \u00b7 approve periodic reports on voting disclosures.\n\n## The ESG Management Committee\n\nThis  weekly  Committee  is  chaired  by  the  member  of executive management in charge of Responsible Investment supervision. It focuses on the definition and implementation of  the  responsible  investment  strategy  by  the  responsible investment team, including monitoring of business development, HR, budgeting, regulatory projects, audits, ESG communication  campaigns,  market  initiatives  and  specific communication topics.\n\nThe Chief Responsible Investment Officer also participates in the Group's Investment Committee.\n\n## 3.2.1.3 Integration of the Responsible Investment and Climate Strategy into the Compensation Policy\n\nThe implementation of Amundi's climate strategy can only be done  by  raising  awareness  among  all  its  stakeholders.  This means  aligning  the  employee  compensation  policy  with Amundi's  ESG  and  climate  strategy.  This  decision  is implemented as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 in  2023,  the  evaluation  of  the  performance  of  the  Chief Executive Officer  and  the  Deputy  Chief  Executive  Officer takes  into  account  the  achievement  of  ESG  objectives (including climate commitments (1) ) and CSR up to 20%. The same will apply for the year 2024, subject to the approval of the compensation policy during the General Shareholders' Meeting on 24 May 2024;\n- \u00b7 the  implementation  of  the  Ambitions  ESG  2025  plan (which includes climate commitments) accounts for 20% of the  criteria  underpinning  the  performance  shares  plan applicable  in  2023  to  Amundi's  more  than  200  senior executives; This provision will be renewed  in  the performance share plan to be awarded in 2024;\n- \u00b7 since 2022, Amundi has integrated ESG objectives into the evaluation of the performance of sales representatives and portfolio managers, so that these objectives are taken into account in their variable compensation.",

        "page_content": "## 3.2.2 A responsible investment policy to support the economy's transition towards a more sustainable model\n\n## 3.2.2.1 ESG analysis at the heart of the responsible investment process\n\nDetails  of  Amundi's  analysis  methodologies  are  available  in the Amundi Responsible Investment Policy, updated annually. ESG  analysis  is  the  responsibility of the responsible investment  team  and  is  integrated  into  Amundi's  portfolio management systems. It is available in real time in the tools used  by  investment  managers  so  as  to  provide  them,  in addition  to  financial  ratings,  with  immediate  access  to  the ESG scores of corporates and sovereign issuers.\n\nAmundi  has  defined  its  own  analytical  framework  and developed its ESG rating methodology. This methodology is both  proprietary  and  centralised.  This  methodology  is  both proprietary and centralised, thereby promoting a consistent approach to responsible investment across the organisation, in line with Amundi's values and priorities.\n\nIn  listed  markets,  Amundi  has  developed  two  main  ESG rating  methodologies,  one  for  companies  and  the  other  for sovereign  entities.  Our  approach  is  based  on  international frameworks,  such  as  the  UN  Global  Compact,  the  OECD Guidelines  on  Corporate  Governance,  the  International Labour Organisation (ILO), and the United Nations Framework  Agreement  on  Climate  Change  (UNFCCC), among others.\n\nThe ESG rating aims to measure the ESG performance of an issuer, e.g. its ability to anticipate and  manage  the sustainability  risks  and  opportunities  inherent  to  its  sector and  particular  situation.  The  ESG  rating  also  assesses  the ability of  the  company's  management  to  manage  the potential negative impact of its activities on the sustainability factors (1) that can affect it.\n\nOur analysis is based primarily on 22 external data providers.\n\n## Corporate issuer analysis\n\nAmundi  applies  a  \"best  in  class\"  approach  in  its  corporate ESG analysis. Each company is assessed by a numerical score scaled around the average of its sector, so as to distinguish between the best and worst practices in the sector. Amundi's assessment  is  based  on  a  combination  of  external  nonfinancial data and qualitative sectoral and thematic analyses. Amundi allocates its ratings on a scale from A, for the best practices, to G, for the worst. Companies that are G-rated are excluded  from  our  actively  managed  funds (2) .  The  issuer's rating  is  taken  into  account  in  the  selection  process  in accordance with the philosophy and objective of the fund.\n\nOur analysis methodology is based on 38 criteria, including 17  generic  criteria,  common  to  all  sectors,  and  21  specific criteria,  relevant  to  the  challenges  of  the  various  sectors. These  criteria  are  designed  to  assess  the  impact  of  ESG issues on companies as well as how fully companies integrate them.  Both  the  impacts  on  sustainability  factors  and  the quality of ESG risk mitigation measures taken by companies are considered in the analysis. All these criteria are available in the investment managers' management tools.\n\nESG  ratings  are  based  on  data  provided  by  specialised companies  and  are  subject  to  a  specific  selection  process. Amundi  guarantees  its  clients  transparency  regarding  the data used.\n\nPortfolio managers and analysts from the various management  platforms  thus  have  permanent  access  to issuers'  ESG  ratings,  as  well  as  related  ESG  analyses  and metrics.  More  than  19,600  issuers  are  given  an  ESG  rating. The investment managers use these ratings and analyses in a differentiated way according to the management processes. For example, different management platforms have developed  alpha-generation  approaches  based  on  the prospects  of  improving  the  ESG  profile  of  invested companies.\n\n## Sovereign issuer analysis\n\nThe  sovereign  issuers  rating  methodology  is  designed  to assess  their  ESG  performance.  The  E,  S  and  G  factors  may have an impact on the ability of States to repay their debts in the  medium  and  long  term.  They  may  also  reflect  the  way countries  pursue  policies  on  key  sustainability  issues  that affect global stability.\n\nAmundi's  methodology  relies  on  about  fifty  ESG  indicators deemed  relevant  by  Amundi's  ESG  research  to  address sustainability risks (1) and sustainability factors (1) . Each indicator  may  combine  several  data  points,  drawn  from different  sources,  including  open  international  databases (such as those of the World Bank Group, the United Nations etc.)  or  proprietary  databases.  Amundi  has  defined  the weight  of  each  ESG  indicator  that  contributes  to  the  final ESG score and the different  components  (E,  S  and  G).  The indicators are obtained from an independent provider.\n\nThe  indicators  have  been  grouped  into  eight  categories  to ensure greater clarity, with each category falling into one of the E, S or G pillars. Like the corporate ESG rating scale, the ESG  analysis  of  sovereign  issuers  results  in  an  ESG  rating ranging from A to G.\n\n## Consideration of environmental transition in the analysis\n\nAs part of its Ambitions ESG 2025 plan, Amundi announced that  it  wanted  to  further  integrate  non-financial  objectives related  to  climate  into  its  active  portfolio  management. Accordingly,  Amundi  is  working  on  establishing  a  rating methodology to assess the transition efforts  undertaken  by issuers in service of the Net Zero scenario, particularly efforts to decarbonise their business and develop green activities.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

It  focuses  on  concrete  results  to  be achieved within a given timeframe, is  proactive  and  is  part  of our overall responsible investment strategy.\n\nThe  engagement  activity  is  led  by  the  ESG  Research, Engagement  and  Voting  team.  It  involves  ESG  analysts  and corporate  governance  analysts.  Engagement  can  also  be carried out by financial analysts or portfolio managers. In any case,  the  ESG  Research,  Engagement  and  Voting  team ensures  the  consistency,  traceability  and  quality  of  these commitments.\n\nOur proactive engagement policy aims to:\n\n- \u00b7 Contribute  to  the  dissemination  of  best  practices  and promote a better integration of sustainability in governance, operations and business development models;\n- \u00b7 Trigger  positive  changes  in  the  way  companies  manage their  impacts  on  key  topics  related  to  the  sustainability  of our society and economy;\n- \u00b7 Support  companies  in  their  own  transition  to  a  more sustainable, inclusive and low-carbon business model;\n- \u00b7 Encourage  companies  to  increase  their  levels  of  investment, research and development, in the areas most needed for this transition.\n\nIn addition, our voting policy makes it possible to best fulfil our duty as a shareholder and underscores the need for:\n\n- \u00b7 A responsible, diversified and efficient Board of Directors;\n- \u00b7 A  corporate  governance  capable  of  understanding  the environmental and social challenges\n- \u00b7 Ensuring  that  boards  and  companies  are  properly  positioned and  prepared  to  manage  the  transition  to  a  sustainable, inclusive and low-carbon economy.\n\nAmundi  engages  the  companies  in  which  it  invests  or  will potentially invest, regardless of the type of holding (investment,  financing  etc.).  Engaged  issuers  are  selected primarily  on  their  level  of  exposure  to  an  engagement  issue. Amundi's engagement extends over different continents and takes specific local circumstances into account. The aim is to have the same level of ambition worldwide, but with gradual expectations according to different geographical areas.\n\nAmundi engages issuers on six key themes:\n\n- \u00b7 The transition towards a low-carbon economy;\n- \u00b7 Natural  capital  preservation  (ecosystem  protection  and fight against biodiversity loss);\n- \u00b7 Social cohesion through the protection of direct and indirect employees and the promotion of human rights;\n- \u00b7 Client, product and societal responsibilities;\n- \u00b7 Strong  governance  practices  that  strengthen  sustainable development;\n- \u00b7 Dialogue to foster increased exercising of the right to vote and a sound corporate governance.\n\nAs part of its Ambitions ESG 2025 plan, Amundi has launched a cycle of engagement on climate issues in 2022 that will see an  additional  1,000  companies  engaged  by  2025.  Amundi specifically requests that businesses publish a detailed climate strategy  based  on  specific  indicators  and  setting  out objectives  for  each  carbon  emission  scope  and  on  the corresponding capital expenditure (investment plan). In 2023, Amundi engaged an additional 966 companies on the climate issue.\n\nThis  engagement  covers  all  environmental,  social  and governance  issues.  Beyond  the  subject  of  climate,  specific subject  engagements  in  2023  focused  on  the  circular economy,  biodiversity,  for  which  specific  reports  were published  on  our  site,  deforestation,  the  protection  of  the oceans, the strategy of alignment with the Paris agreements, physical  risks,  the  just  transition,  human  rights,  the  living wage,  gender  diversity  and  the  equitable  distribution  of added value within companies.\n\n## 3.2.2.3 A voting policy that complements the engagement process\n\nAmundi's  Voting  Policy  is  publicly  available  and  updated annually.\n\nAmundi's  voting  policy  is  based  on  the  conviction  that  the consideration of environmental, social and good governance issues  by  the  Boards  of  Directors  is  essential  to  the  sound management  of  a  business.  Amundi  intends  to  play  its  full role as a responsible investor and is thus gearing itself up to support resolutions on climate or social issues.\n\nThe voting policy is reviewed annually, based on the lessons learnt from the previous campaign. The Corporate Governance team  submits  proposals  for  changes  to  their voting  practices  on  the  main  pillars:  Shareholder  Rights, Boards, Committees and Executive Bodies, Financial Operations  and  Executive  Compensation  Policies.  Policy changes are approved by the Voting Committee.\n\nWe focus on holding the members of the Boards of Directors accountable, by not hesitating to call out individual directors for  poor  management  of  the  issues  assigned  to  them,  in particular  with  regard  to  their  responsibility  for  monitoring environmental  and  social  issues.  In  addition,  we  very  often supported shareholder resolutions demanding greater transparency  on  matters  of  ecological  and  the  energy transition. We thus record 88% of votes in favour of climate-\n\nrelated shareholder resolutions at the General Shareholders' Meetings of companies in which Amundi participated as an investor.\n\nIn the  context  of  exercising  the  voting  rights  of  its Undertakings for Collective Investment (UCIs), Amundi may be  faced  with  situations  of  potential  conflicts  of  interest. Measures  to  prevent  and  manage  this  risk  have  therefore been  put  in  place.  The  first  preventive  measure  is  the definition  and  publication  of  the  voting  policy  validated  by the management  bodies  of  the  Group's  management companies. The second measure involves submitting to the Voting  Committee,  for  validation  ahead  of  the  General Shareholders'  Meeting,  the  voting  proposals  for  resolutions relating to a pre-established list of listed companies that are considered  sensitive  due  to  their  links  with  Amundi.  In addition to these previously identified issuers, the Corporate Governance team also submits to the Voting Committee the General  Meetings  for  which  conflicts  of  interest  have  been identified during the analysis of the resolutions.\n\nSince  2022,  in  order  to  best  exercise  its  responsibility  as  a manager in the exclusive interest  of  its  clients,  Amundi  has decided to vote the majority of the UCIs managed, regardless of their management method.",

        "page_content": "## 3.2.2.4 A targeted exclusion policy\n\nAmundi has set minimum standards and exclusion policies on critical topics regarding sustainability, triggering specific followups and escalation procedures when violations by an issuer are identified,  which  may  lead  to  engagement,  specific  voting actions (if applicable) or exclusion.\n\nDetails  of  Amundi's  Minimum  Standards  and  Exclusion  Policy are  available  in  Amundi's  General  Responsible  Investment Policy.\n\nThe  ESG  and  Climate  Strategy  Committee  validates  the  main strategic orientations of the responsible investment policy and the ESG Rating Committee defines the rules for implementing the exclusion policy. Issuers subject to exclusion are reported in the  management  tools  and  transactions  on  these  names  are blocked  before  they  are  traded.  The  risk  department  ensures second-level controls.\n\nThe  Minimum  Standards  and  Exclusion  Policy  are  applied  to actively managed portfolios and passive ESG portfolios, unless otherwise  requested  by  our  clients,  and  always  in  compliance with applicable laws and regulations. These rules are implemented  on  all  new  mandates  or  dedicated  funds,  in accordance  with  our  pre-contractual  documentation,  unless otherwise requested by the client.\n\nFor the passive management fund, application of the exclusion policy differs between ESG products and non-ESG products:\n\n- \u00b7 For  ESG  passive  funds:  All  ESG  ETFs  and  ESG  index  funds apply the Amundi Minimum Standards and Exclusion Policy.\n- \u00b7 For  non-ESG  passive  funds:  The  fiduciary  duty  is  to reproduce  an  index  as  faithfully  as  possible.  The  portfolio manager therefore has limited room for manoeuvre and must respect  the  contractual  objectives  so  that  the  passive exposure is  perfectly  in  line  with  the  benchmark  requested. Amundi's  index  funds/ETFs,  replicating  standard  (non-ESG) benchmarks  do  not  apply  systematic  exclusions  beyond those  imposed  by  the  regulations.  However,  for  securities that are excluded from the active investment universe, due to the application of Amundi's  Minimum  Standards  and Exclusion  Policy,  but  may  be  present  in  non-ESG  passive funds, Amundi has strengthened its engagement process and voting shares that may lead to a vote against the discharge of the board of directors or management, or against the reelection of the chairman and certain directors.\n\nThe  Minimum  Standards  and  the  Exclusion  Policy  establish  a distinction between the exclusion criteria applied to companies from those of sovereign states. The first targets activities  and practices that may lead to the exclusion of securities issued by a  company. The latter may lead to the exclusion of sovereign bonds.\n\n## 1. Norms-based exclusions related to international conventions\n\nAmundi excludes the following issuers:\n\n- \u00b7 Issuers  involved  in  the  manufacture,  sale,  stockpiling  or services  related  to  anti-personnel  mines  and  cluster bombs, prohibited by the Ottawa and Oslo treaties (1) ;\n- \u00b7 Issuers involved in the production, trade or stockpiling of chemical (2) , biological (3) and depleted uranium weapons (4) ;\n- \u00b7 Issuers who seriously and repeatedly violate one or more of  the  ten  principles  of  the  United  Nations  Global Compact (5) , without taking credible corrective action.\n\n## 2. Sectoral Policies\n\nAmundi  is  implementing  targeted  sectoral  exclusions, specific  to  the  coal,  unconventional  hydrocarbons,  tobacco and nuclear weapons industries.\n\n## A. Thermal coal\n\nCoal  combustion  is  the  main  contributor  to  human-induced climate  change (6) .  The  phasing  out  of  coal  is  paramount  to achieving the decarbonisation of our economies. This is why Amundi  is  committed  to  phasing  out  thermal  coal  from  its investments  by  2030  in  the  European  Union  and  OECD countries, and by 2040 in the rest of the world.\n\nIn 2016, Amundi set up a sectoral policy dedicated to thermal coal,  resulting  in  the  exclusion  of  certain  companies  and issuers.  Since  then,  Amundi  has  gradually  strengthened  the rules and thresholds of its thermal coal policy.\n\nIn  line  with  the  United  Nations  Sustainable  Development Goals (SDGs) and the 2015 Paris Agreement, this strategy is based  on  the  research  and  recommendations  of  the  Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Scientific Committee, which takes into account the scenarios  developed  by  the  International  Energy  Agency (IEA),  the  Climate  Analytics  report  and  the  Science  Based Targets.\n\nThis policy applies to all companies in which we invest, but primarily affects mining companies, utilities and transportation infrastructure companies. The scope concerned  covers  all  active  management  strategies  and  all passive  management  ESG  strategies,  on  which  Amundi applies discretionary management (7) .\n\nIn line with our thermal coal phase-out schedule by 2030/2040, the  following  rules  and  thresholds  are  the  benchmark  from which companies are deemed too exposed to be able to phase out thermal coal at an appropriate pace.\n\nIn  2023,  1,748  issuers  (corporates  and  sovereigns  were excluded from the managed portfolios.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\n## Amundi's commitments\n\nWhere applicable (1) , Amundi excludes:\n\n- \u00b7 mining, utilities and transportation infrastructure companies,  which  are  developing  thermal  coal  projects, benefiting from an authorised status, and which are in the building phase.\n\nCompanies whose thermal coal projects are at earlier stages of  development,  including  announced,  proposed  projects, with a pre-authorised status, are monitored on yearly basis.\n\nWith regard to mining, Amundi excludes:\n\n- \u00b7 companies realising more than 20% of their revenue from thermal coal mining extraction;\n- \u00b7 companies whose annual thermal coal mining extraction is greater  than  or  equal  to  70  million  tonnes,  with  no intention of reducing this amount.\n\nFor companies deemed too exposed to be able to abandon thermal coal at the appropriate pace, Amundi excludes:\n\n- \u00b7 all  companies  that  generate  more  than  50%  of  their revenue from the mining extraction of thermal coal and the production of electricity from thermal coal;\n- \u00b7 all companies that generate between 20% and 50% of their revenue  from  thermal  coal-based  electricity  production and  thermal  coal  mining  extraction, and  have  an insufficient transition trajectory (2) .\n\nIn  addition,  Amundi  conducts  engagement  actions  with  all companies held in the portfolio that are exposed to thermal coal  (on  the  basis  of  revenue)  and  that  have  not  yet published  a  thermal  coal  exit  policy  consistent  with  the 2030/2040 phase-out schedule set by Amundi.\n\nIn  addition,  for  companies  excluded  from  the  investment universe or those considered late with regard to their thermal coal  policy,  Amundi  applies  escalation  measures  which consist  of  voting  against  the  discharge  of  the  board  or management or against the re-election of the chairman and certain directors.\n\n## B. Unconventional hydrocarbons\n\nInvesting  in  companies  with  high  exposure  to  fossil  fuels leads to increasing social, environmental and economic risks. Once  extracted,  shale  oil,  shale  gas  and  oil  sands  are  no different  from  natural  gas  or  conventional  oil  that  will continue  to  contribute  to  the  global  energy  mix  in  the coming years, according to the IEA's \"Sustainable Development Scenario\" and the IEA's \"NZE 2050 Scenario\". However,  unconventional  oil  and  gas  exploration  and production  is  exposed  to  acute  climate  risks  (due  to potentially  higher  methane  emissions  -  if  not  properly managed - for shale oil and gas, and higher carbon intensity for oil sands), environmental risks (water use and contamination,  induced  seismicity  and  air  pollution)  and social risks (public health (3) ).\n\nWhere  applicable (4) , Amundi  excludes  companies  whose activity related  to  the  exploration  and  production  of unconventional  hydrocarbons  (including  shale  oil,  shale  gas and oil sands) represents more than 30% of revenue.\n\n## C. Tobacco\n\nTobacco not only has a negative impact on public health, but its  value  chain  also  faces  human  rights  violations,  and specific health problems that affect its workforce. It also has an impact on poverty, has significant environmental consequences and bears substantial economic costs (estimated  at  more  than  $1  trillion  per  year  worldwide, according to estimates by the World Health Organization (5) ). In  May 2020, Amundi became a signatory to the \"TobaccoFree Finance Pledge\".\n\nAmundi penalizes issuers exposed to the tobacco value chain by limiting their ESG score and has put in place an exclusion policy for cigarette companies. This policy affects the entire tobacco industry, including suppliers, cigarette manufacturers and retailers.\n\nAmundi applies the following rules:\n\n- \u00b7 exclusion of companies  that  manufacture  complete tobacco  products  (application  thresholds:  revenue  above 5%);\n- \u00b7 the ESG score for the tobacco sector is capped at E (on the  rating  scale  from  A  to  G).  This  policy  applies  to companies involved in tobacco manufacturing, supply and distribution activities (application  thresholds:  revenue greater than 10%).\n\n## D. Nuclear armament\n\nAs  stipulated  in  the  Treaty  on  the  Non-Proliferation  of Nuclear  Weapons  (NPT):  \"the  proliferation  of  nuclear weapons would considerably increase the risk of nuclear war\" and such a war could lead to devastation that \"would affect all humanity\". Therefore, \"it is necessary to make every effort to avoid the danger of such a war and to take measures to safeguard  the  safety  of  the  populations\".  The  fundamental objective of nuclear weapons must clearly be deterrence, and trade must be carried out with extreme caution.\n\nAmundi  restricts  investments  in  companies  exposed  to nuclear weapons, especially those involved in the production of  key  components  and/or  dedicated  to  nuclear  weapons. Amundi  excludes  issuers  that  meet  at  least  one  of  the following conditions:\n\n- \u00b7 issuers  involved  in  the  production,  sale  or  stockpiling  of nuclear weapons from states that have not ratified the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, or from states that are signatories to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons but are not members of NATO;\n- \u00b7 issuers  involved  in  the  production  of  nuclear  warheads and/or  complete  nuclear  missiles,  as  well  as  components that have been significantly developed and/or modified for exclusive use in nuclear weapons;\n- \u00b7 issuers that earn more than 5% of their revenue from the production or sale of nuclear weapons, with the exception of  revenues  from  dual-use  components  as  well  as  launch platforms.\n\n## Sovereign bonds\n\nCountries on the European Union (EU) sanctions list with a sanction consisting of an asset freeze and a sanction index at the  highest  level  (taking  into  account  both  US  and  EU sanctions)  are  excluded,  after  formal  review  and  validation by the ESG Ratings Committee.",

Reflecti Amundi's commitment as a  responsible  investor,  100%  of  actively  managed  openended funds include ESG criteria where technically possible. In addition, Amundi's ESG analysis covers over 19,650 issuers.\n\nAmundi  has  defined  and  developed  many  indicators  to identify  and  manage  the  risks  and  opportunities  related  to the environmental  transition: the carbon  footprint of\n\nportfolios,  the  alignment  of  companies  based  on  data  from the Science  Based  Targets  Initiative ,  the  energy  transition rating, the just transition rating, etc. Using this wide range of indicators,  Amundi is able to set short-, medium- and longterm climate objectives.\n\nAll  these  climate-related indicators are detailed in Amundi's annual  Climate  and  Sustainability  report,  available  on Amundi's website (legroupe.amundi.com).\n\n## 3.2.2.6 A Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services policy\n\nThe issue of biodiversity, intrinsically linked to that of climate change, is becoming increasingly important in our societies, in research,  but  also  in  economic  considerations.  The economic impact of biodiversity and ecosystem degradation, as  well  as  the  depletion  of  finite  natural  resources,  is  a serious risk to the economy and society.\n\nBiodiversity is one of the themes addressed in Amundi's ESG analysis.  It  is  reflected  in  the  methodological  grid via the \"Biodiversity  &  Pollution\"  criterion  and  thus  plays  a  role  in determining  the  issuers'  ESG  rating.  Amundi  also  pays particular  attention  to  biodiversity-related  controversies. In  2023,  Amundi  continued  its  actions  to  better  integrate biodiversity  into  internal  analysis  and  investment  processes and  adopted  a  new  \"Biodiversity  and  Ecosystem  Services\" policy. This policy targets the four main  drivers  of biodiversity  loss:  change  in  land  and  sea  use,  direct exploitation of natural resources,  climate  change  and pollution (1) . The  policy  focuses  on  companies  that  are particularly exposed to activities that harm biodiversity and that present insufficient management of the associated risks. It considers activities that have a potential critical impact on forests or water, offshore mining activities, and more broadly the  extractive  activities  of  mining,  oil  and  gas  companies that  operate  in  biodiversity-sensitive  areas.  The  policy  also considers pesticide production, as well as the main producers and users of single-use plastic. All companies thus identified are  the  subject  of  a  dedicated  dialogue  in  order  to  make improvements.  When  the  commitment  fails  or  if  the company's  remediation  plan  seems  weak,  the  mode  of escalation  even  provides  for  exclusion.  The  exclusion  of  an issuer  is  subject  to  the  vote  of  a  dedicated  ESG  Rating Committee.\n\nIn  2023,  618  companies (2) were  engaged  through  various programmes  related  to  the  preservation  of  natural  capital (the biodiversity strategy, the preservation of the oceans, the promotion of a circular economy and better management of plastic,  the  prevention  of  deforestation,  and  various  topics\n\nrelated  in  particular  to  the  limitation  of  pollution  or  the sustainable  management  of  water  resources).  Amundi  has also joined Nature Action 100, a global engagement initiative to  strengthen corporate ambition and action to reverse the loss of nature and biodiversity.\n\nIn addition, the subject was included among the Responsible Investment Research team's issues of priority analysis, which resulted  in  the  production  of  a  series  of  research  papers entitled \"Biodiversity: it's  time  to  protect  our  only  home\" in ten parts and published online in 2023. In this way, Amundi seeks  to  participate  in  the  dissemination  and  sharing  of knowledge  in  line  with  the  principles  of  the  \"Finance  for Biodiversity Pledge\".\n\nIn 2022, Amundi began deploying data that will enable it to calculate  the  biodiversity  footprint  of  its  portfolios.  The metric  used  to  display  the  biodiversity  footprint  is  the MSAppb * per \u20ac billion (3) .  This  makes it possible to quantify the impact of companies' activities and their value chain on their  environment. In 2023, Amundi finalised the integration of  biodiversity  footprint  data  into  its  tools  and  chose  an additional data provider to complete its analysis.\n\nFinally,  Amundi  continued  its  commitment  to  marketplace initiatives  and  working  groups  dedicated  to  biodiversity. In 2021, Amundi joined the \"Finance for Biodiversity Pledge\" collective investor initiative and thus committed to collaborate  and  share  its  knowledge,  to  engage  with businesses  and  to  assess  its  impacts  and  set  targets  about biodiversity,  as  well  as  to  disclose  them  publicly.  Following the  dissemination  of  the  first  framework  on  risks  and opportunities related to nature and biodiversity of the TNFD ( Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosure (4) ), Amundi participated in a pilot project in 2023, launched by the TNFD to  test  the  feasibility  of  its  framework  on  different  aspects. Led by UNEP-FI and CDC Biodiversit\u00e9, the Group tested the TNFD approach, and more specifically the application of the GBS ( Global Biodiversity Score (5) ) for financial institutions.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

They  are  designed  to  meet the  various  ESG  preferences  of  our  clients  and  fall  into several broad categories:\n\n## ESG integration solutions\n\nAmundi's ESG integration process is applied by default to all actively  managed  open-ended  funds  (master  and  feeder funds), whenever technically possible. The objective of each fund is to achieve a better weighted average ESG score than the weighted average ESG score of its ESG benchmark. Many individual  products  or  ranges  of  funds  also  benefit  from further ESG integration, via higher selectivity, a higher rating level or higher non-financial indicators, or a broader selection of issues, etc.\n\nIn the framework of the ESG Ambitions 2025 Plan, Amundi is committed  to  integrate  the  assessment  of  companies  with regard to their decarbonisation efforts and the development of  their  green  activities  into  the  actively  managed  openended  funds.  Amundi  also  has  the  ambition  to  continue  to expand its offer of ESG ETFs with the objective of reaching 40% of the range of ETF products in ESG ETFs.\n\n## Impact products\n\nImpact investments are investments made with the intention to generate  positive,  measurable,  social  and/or  environmental impact alongside a financial yield. Impact is measured in relation to  specific  impact  goals  that  have  been  defined  ex-ante  and are based on the intentionality of investors or, where applicable, of  the  companies  in  which  they  invest.  To  qualify  impact products,  Amundi  has  developed  an  internal  evaluation  grid specific to this type of fund. It is used to evaluate funds on the three  key  dimensions  of  impact  investment:  intentionality, measurability  and  additionality.  Funds  must  have  a minimum score  across  all  three  dimensions  and  minimum  requirements met in the Intentionality dimension to be categorised as Impact products.\n\nUnder the Ambitions ESG 2025 plan, Amundi has committed to expanding  the  range  of  impact  investment  solutions  to \u20ac20 billion.\n\n## Launch of the \"Net Zero Ambition\" range\n\nIn line with the Group's overall objective of contributing to the effort to transition the economy to Net Zero ,  this year Amundi announced  the  launch  of  a  complete  range  of  \"Net  Zero Ambition\" funds. This range is intended to cover the main asset classes, management style and geographical areas. Amundi has developed  a  clean  investment  framework  that  defines  the minimum  conditions  to  be  met  for  an  active  management product to be stamped \"Net Zero Ambition\":\n\n- \u00b7 An overall objective of reducing the carbon intensity in order to  monitor  the  progress  of  the  portfolio  with  regard  to  the reduction  trajectories  of  the  reference  universe,  compatible with a limitation of global warming to 1.5\u00b0C compared to the pre-industrial level.\n- \u00b7 A  constraint  of  minimum  exposure  to  high  climate  impact sectors to encourage transition in these key sectors.\n- \u00b7 Targeted exclusions of issuers in sectors deemed incompatible  with  the  objective  of  transitioning  to  a  lowcarbon economy.\n\nBy  providing  a  range  of  actively  managed  transition  funds, Amundi aims to steer savings into investment solutions that are able to support the transition of issuers, while offering resources to  its  clients  to  align  their  portfolios  with  their  own  climate commitments they have made. Savers will thus have the option of investing their savings in funds that fully incorporate this Net Zero transition objective.\n\n## Variation of the \"Net Zero Ambition\" range launched in 2023 on major asset classes\n\nIn 2023, Amundi accelerated the development of its \"Ambition Net Zero\" offer with the launch of the following solutions:\n\n- \u00b7 For equities:\n\nThe  launch  of  three  different  \"Net  Zero  Ambition\"  active management funds covering global equities, Europe as well as emerging markets. These three investment solutions assess the credibility and feasibility of companies' decarbonisation objectives and select the issuers best able to support the real economy towards Net Zero .\n\n- \u00b7 For bonds:\n\nLaunch of two \"Net Zero Ambition\" active management funds with  the  objective  of  generating  performance  while  gradually reducing their carbon intensity compared to a benchmark with a decarbonisation trajectory.\n\n- \u00b7 In diversified management\n\nLaunch  of  a  diversified  global  equity  and  bond  strategy  that aims  to  reduce  its  carbon  intensity  while  funding  the  energy transition across a wide range of asset classes.\n\n- \u00b7 On Real Estate\n\nLaunch  of  an  impactful  real  estate  management  strategy.  It aims to distribute  to  investors  a  regular  coupon  accompanied by  long-term  capital  growth  in  the  belief  that,  in  the  future, assets that are part of a decarbonisation trajectory will be more attractive to tenants and investors.\n\n- \u00b7 On Climate ETFs\n\nWith more than 30 climate ETFs aligned with the objectives of the Paris Agreement launched or transformed in 2023, Amundi offers a complete range of passive management on the subject. Amundi's  ETF,  Index  and  Smart  Beta  business  line  offers investors  a  simple  way  to  invest  in  the  transition  to  a  lowcarbon  economy  regardless  of  the  geographical  area  (World, Europe, United States or emerging markets).",

This  fund  is  built  in  such  a  way  as  to  have  a reduction  in  carbon  intensity  which  is  in  line  with  the Climate Transition Benchmark composite;\n- \u00b7 AMUNDI  FUNDS  NET  ZERO  AMBITION  TOP  EUROPEAN PLAYERS,  a  European  equity  fund  that  aims  to  seize investment  opportunities,  primarily  in  listed  European equities,  to  decarbonise  the  global  economy.  This  sousfund  is  built  in  such  a  way  as  to  have  a  carbon  intensity reduction  in  line  with  the  MSCI  Europe  Climate  Paris Aligned benchmark;\n- \u00b7 Amundi EUR Corporate Bond Climate Net  Zero Ambition PAB, a euro credit ETF compliant with the European Paris Aligned Benchmark regulation.\n\nBeyond  this  range,  Amundi  has  also  launched  other strategies related to the Climate:\n\n- \u00b7 CPRAM  launched  in  January  2023  CPR  Invest  -  Circular Economy,  a  thematic  fund  of  international  equities,  in active  management, which aims to support the transition from a linear economy to a circular economy;\n- \u00b7 CPRAM  strengthened  its  range  at  the  end  of  2023  with CPR Invest - B&W Climate Target 2028, a credit solution invested mainly in bonds with a maturity of 5 years, with the objective of selecting companies with best practices in the fight against climate change, and CPR Invest - Climate\n\n## 3.2.3.3 Innovative partnerships\n\nAmundi develops solutions  to  finance  the  energy  transition and  inclusive  growth  through  innovative  partnerships  with large public investors. We encourage initiatives that stimulate both  supply  and  demand,  contributing  to  the  development of sustainable capital markets and the growth of responsible financing and investment solutions.\n\nBetween 2018 and 2023, Amundi developed strategies with the following four partners:\n\n- \u00b7 the World Bank's International Finance Corporation (IFC):\n- \u00b7 in 2018, launch of the largest green bond fund issued in emerging markets, Amundi Planet Emerging Green One\n\nUltra  Short  Term  Bond,  a  cash  solution  that  combines short-term investment on a selection of Investment Grade securities  and  support  for  companies  committed  to participating in the climate transition;\n\n- \u00b7 Amundi Real Assets launched Amundi Ambition Agri Agro Direct  Lending  Europe:  an  impact  fund,  which  aims  to finance  the  transition  of  the  agriculture  and  agri-food sectors in Europe to a more sustainable model.\n\nStrategies  on  other  dimensions  of  responsible  investment have also emerged in 2023:\n\n- \u00b7 Amundi  launched  AMUNDI  FUNDS  ASIA  INCOME  ESG BOND, a fund that invests in a wide range of instruments in Asian fixed-income markets, aiming to provide a high level of  income  from  diversified  sources,  with  a  strong  ESG approach  that  aims  for  a  minimum  allocation  to  green, social and  sustainable  bonds  while  reporting  on  4 predefined ESG key performance indicators;\n- \u00b7 BFT IM has enhanced its \"Invest in France for sustainable growth\"  offer  with  the  creations  of  sustainable  bonds called  BFT  France  Obligations  Durables  ISR  (Socially Responsible  Investment),  with  funds  invested  mainly  in green  and  social  bonds  issued  by  French  companies  and BFT  France  Solidaire  ISR,  a  fund  invested  in  company shares  that  have  an  impact  on  employment  and  in solidarity companies;\n- \u00b7 Launch by CPRAM in March 2023 of two funds which aim to finance  the  strengthening  of  Europe's  sovereignty:  CPR Invest - European Strategic Autonomy, active management fund in European equities and CPR Invest - B&W European Strategic  Autonomy  2028,  \"buy  and  watch\"  diversified credit funds.\n\nIn passive  management ,  Amundi  proactively  continued  its ESG  development  with  the  launch  of  new  investment solutions in 2023.\n\nIn  addition  to  the  aforementioned  PAB  Euro  Credit  ETF, Amundi  has  launched  the  Amundi  Euro  Government  Tilted Green  Bond  ETF,  a  Euro  Govies  sovereign  ETF  with  30% exposure  to  Green  Bonds  of  sovereign  issuers,  to  help investors  improve  the  sustainability  profile  of  their  Govies allocation.\n\nThese launches are in line with the commitment made as part of  the  ESG  Ambition  2025  plan  to  expand  the  range  of responsible  investment  strategies  in  passive  management and to ensure that 40% of the ETF range is made up of ESG ETFs  by  2025.  In  particular,  the  Amundi  Euro  Government Tilted Green  Bond  ETF  offers  a  robust  approach  to supporting  the  transition  efforts  of  governments  in  the eurozone.\n\n(\"AP EGO\"). The initiative has since invested $1.4 billion in green bonds from emerging countries. In addition, the objectives  related  to  the  share  of  green  bonds  in  the portfolio  were  achieved  in  advance  of  the  targets  set (target of 70% in 2023 exceeded during 2022);\n\n- \u00b7 in 2021, announcement  of the Build-Back-Better Emerging  Markets  Sustainable  Transaction (\"BEST\") Bond  Fund strategy  which  aims  to  mobilise  private capital  towards  sustainable  emerging  markets  bonds, promoting  green,  resilient  and  inclusive  growth.

Investing  in labelled  green  bonds  and  unlabelled  climate  bonds,  it engages  with  issuing  companies  to  help  them  evolve their business models to increase climate resilience and green leadership.\n- \u00b7 Application  in  2023  of  the  CCIF  scheme  to  an  openended  fund  of  $200  million,  supported  by  a  major consultant and  providing  international institutional investors  with  a  tool  to  measure  climate-related  risks and opportunities emanating from their portfolio.\n\n## 3.2.4 Responsible investment: a responsibility shared by all employees\n\nAll  of  Amundi's  employees  are  involved  in  the  company's  social  project  under  the  guidance  and  support  of  the  dedicated responsible investment team.\n\n## 3.2.4.1 Parties involved in active management\n\n## Cross-functional governance between the active management and the responsible investment teams\n\nStrategic  alignment  and  cooperation  between  the  active management and responsible investment teams are ensured through committees of decision makers from both teams.\n\nSenior  executives  of  the  Responsible  Investment  business line are  members  of  the  Key  Committees  of  Active Management:\n\n- \u00b7 the  CRIO  ( Chief  Responsible  Investment  Officer )  is  a member  of  the  two  Executive  Committees  of  Active Management (select committee and enlarged committee);\n- \u00b7 the CRIO and the Head of ESG Research, Engagement and Voting are members of the Global Investment Committee.\n\nLikewise,  senior  executives  of  the  active  management business line are members of the decision-making Responsible Investment Committees. The CIO ( Chief Investment  Officer )  is  a  member  of  the  ESG  &  Climate Strategy Committee and the Voting Committee.\n\n## Integration of ESG into the investment process\n\n## A. Common foundations for all portfolios\n\n## ESG mainstreaming (at global portfolio level)\n\nAmundi's ESG integration process is applied by default to all actively  managed  open-ended  funds  (master  and  feeder funds), whenever technically possible. The objective of each fund is to achieve a better weighted average ESG score than the weighted average ESG score of its ESG benchmark. This means that all relevant portfolio managers take into account the issuers' ESG scores, as defined by our proprietary rating system, in order to meet their funds' objectives.\n\n## Integration into portfolio stock selection\n\nESG criteria, like financial criteria, are an integral part of the overall  analysis  framework  of  issuers.  The  assessment  of business models incorporates the ESG factors relevant to the company, many of which depend on the industry in which it operates.\n\n## Engagement and voting\n\nThe  engagement  policy  is  defined  by  the  Responsible Investment team, in conjunction with the investment teams. It is deployed  through  dialogue  with  issuers,  with  the involvement of investment platforms. The engagement aims to encourage and incentivise companies to take into account social, environmental and governance issues, with a view to improving their financial and non-financial performance.\n\nAmundi's voting policy supplements  the  engagement strategy.  It  is  based  on  an  integrated  approach  to  the company,  and  analyses  in  particular  the  consideration  of environmental and social issues by its Board of Directors and within its governance.  The  Voting  Committee  is  the governance  body  that  validates  the  voting  policy.  Several investment  platform  managers  are  members  of  the  Voting Committee and participate in all decisions taken.\n\n## Integration in research by the Amundi Investment Institute\n\nFor  the  Amundi  Investment  Institute's  research  teams,  the integration of ESG issues is structured around the following targets:\n\n- \u00b7 inclusion of climate and social issues in the calculations of projected yields on asset classes in the long term;\n- \u00b7 development and proposal of new ESG and climate impact investment strategies to investment teams.\n\n## B. Development of specific ranges whose value proposition is centred on ESG, or which have specific ESG objectives\n\n- \u00b7 Net  Zero  Ambition Products: these  products  have  an additional objective of reducing the carbon footprint of a portfolio by a given percentage each year, consistent with the 2050 carbon neutrality target. Issuers that commit to achieving carbon footprint reduction targets while investing  in  the  transition  to  a  low-carbon  society contribute  to  the  transition  and  position  themselves  to benefit from it.",

        "page_content": "- \u00b7 Engagement  Equity  Products: these products  place engagement at the heart of their approach. As a long-term shareholder, Amundi aims to influence the ESG practices of the companies in which she invests. Amundi's management  and  engagement  teams  have  in-depth discussions  with  the  companies'  management  teams  in order to encourage them to better take into account the impacts of ESG issues on their business model.\n- \u00b7 \"ESG  Improvers\"  Products: these  products  capture  the alpha  generated  by  companies  whose  ESG  profile  we believe  is  improving.  In  this  case,  priority  is  given  to investing  in  companies  at  an  early  stage  of  their  ESG transformation by assessing their potential for improvement and their transformation trajectory.\n- \u00b7 Green,  Social  and  Sustainable  bonds: these  products allow investments in projects contributing to the ecological transition  or  to  actions  with  a  strong  social  impact, particularly for disadvantaged communities.\n\n## 3.2.4.2 Parties involved in passive management\n\n## Shared governance between the passive management and the responsible investment teams\n\nThe passive management platform teams work closely with the  responsible  investment  teams  and  in  particular  the quantitative  research  teams.  This  cooperation  makes  it possible to broaden discussions regarding the implementation of new ESG or Climate solutions for clients or to coordinate dialogue with index providers.\n\nIn addition, the passive management platform participates in the ESG & Climate Strategy Committee and the ESG Rating Committee,  thereby  ensuring  coordination  between  the teams  in  the  implementation  of  the  Group's  responsible investment strategy.\n\n## Integration of ESG in the investment process\n\nAmundi's passive management fully takes part in the Group's ambitions in terms of responsible investment.\n\nMoreover, the intrinsic characteristics of index management and ETFs in particular - simplicity, accessibility and low cost - make these products effective tools for broadening access to responsible investment.\n\nResponsible investment in Amundi's passive management is based on three pillars:\n\n## A. Replication of ESG and Climate/ Net Zero indices\n\nAmundi  has  the  widest  range  of  responsible  ETFs  on  the European  market.  This  covers  the  main  asset  classes  and geographical regions for a diversified portfolio allocation.\n\nIn line with the Ambitions ESG 2025 plan, Amundi intends to continue to expand this range with the objective to have 40% of the total ETF range in ESG ETFs by 2025.\n\n## Integration into the portfolio management tool\n\nInvestment  teams  have  integrated  access  to  ESG  data  and scores via Amundi's proprietary portfolio management tool, ALTO.  This  allows investment managers  to  consider sustainability  risks  and  negative  impacts  on  sustainability factors  in  their  investment  decision  process  and  to  apply Amundi's exclusion policy as appropriate. They are also able to  design  and  manage  their  portfolio  in  compliance  with specific  ESG  rules  and  ESG  objectives  that  may  apply  to investment  strategies  and  products  for  which  they  are responsible.\n\nAchieving this objective requires not only the launch of new products, but above all a proactive approach to transforming funds  from  replicating  traditional  indices  to  responsible indices.\n\nWith  regards  to  Climate  / Net  Zero solutions,  Amundi's passive platform was a pioneer in the development of index solutions with the co-creation in 2014 of the first low-carbon indexes  with  MSCI,  AP4  and  the  \"Fonds  de  R\u00e9serve  des Retraites\". Since then, Amundi has continued to innovate and was  one  of  the  first  players  to  launch  ETFs  replicating  the \"EU Climate Transition\" and \"EU Paris Aligned Benchmark\".\n\n## B. Customised ESG optimisation or exclusion solutions\n\nThe  development  of  fully  dedicated  responsible  index solutions is one of the strengths of the passive management platform.\n\nIt  leverages in-depth knowledge of equity and bond market indices, ongoing dialogue with index providers and continuous cooperation with the Group's quantitative research  teams.  In  addition,  the  Solutions  and  Engineering team  within  the  investment  team  helps  support  clients  in their  ESG  or Net  Zero transition  objectives  by  carrying  out simulations and in a tangible way illustrating the impacts of ESG and Climate filters and optimisation in their portfolio.\n\n## C. Voting and engagement\n\nFinally,  Amundi  believes  that  being  a  responsible  passive investment manager goes beyond developing and managing responsible  products  and  solutions.  It  requires  a  robust engagement  strategy  and  voting  policy  to  promote  the transition  to  a  more  sustainable,  low  carbon  and  inclusive economy.  Amundi's  actions  in  terms  of  engagement  and voting  apply  to  all  its  asset  management  activities,  both passive and active.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

This new structure reinforces the close  collaboration  that  has  existed  for  several  years between  the  investment  teams  of  the  AARA  platform  and Amundi's  ESG  Research  team,  in  order  to  integrate  and implement  the  ambitions  of  Amundi's  Ambitions  ESG 2025 plan at the heart of AARA's strategy.\n\nAmundi  Alternatives and Real Assets' commitments  to responsible investment revolve around three major pillars, namely:\n\n- \u00b7 acting for the climate;\n- \u00b7 increasing transparency;\n- \u00b7 aligning the interests of all stakeholders.\n\nIn order to ensure  transparency  on  the  governance principles,  policy  and  strategy  that  guide  the  integration  of ESG criteria into its investment policy, Amundi Alternative & Real  Assets  has  established  a  Responsible  Investment Charter  and  published  in  2023  the  second  edition  of  its responsible investor report:\n\nTo  strengthen  its  commitment  to  ESG  and  take  a  step further  in  supporting  SMEs  and  midcaps,  by  promoting exchanges  on  their  best  practices,  for  the  second  year  in October 2023, Amundi Alternatives & Real Assets organised the ESG meeting dedicated to SMEs and midcaps that AARA supports in private equity and private debt.\n\n## Amundi Immobilier\n\nWith  a  \u20ac37  billion  of  assets  under  management,  Amundi Immobilier  has  been  placing  ESG  at  the  heart  of  its management and investment processes for more than twelve years.  Amundi  Immobilier  has  been  committed  in  this  area since 2010, when it implemented an ESG Charter, becoming one of the founding members of the Sustainable Real Estate Observatory  (Observatoire  de  l'immobilier  durable,  OID), where  it  also  acts  as  Treasurer.  Amundi  Immobilier  also contributes to market association projects whose objective is to bring transparency and greater consideration of environmental,  social  and  governance  aspects  throughout the  entire  value  chain  of  the  real  estate  business,  and  in particular in those ensuring the development of the SRI Label for real estate funds.\n\nAmundi  Immobilier  actively  contributes  to  various  initiatives  in favour of biodiversity or to take into account non-financial issues by the real estate value  chain at the European level, such as:\n\n- \u00b7 Biodiversity  Impulsion  Group (BIG) which  aims  to develop a common  framework  of indicators and measurement tools to define and improve the biodiversity footprint of property projects;\n- \u00b7 European Sustainability Real Estate Initiative (ESREI), which aims,  within  the  Observatory  for  Sustainable  Real  Estate (OID), to broaden the scope of its research to the European level,  and  in  particular  to  reinforce  technical  and  regulatory monitoring in the countries of the European Union and at the level of the European Commission, as well as to create a network of European sustainable property players.\n\nAs  an  active  member  of  the  Commission  of  the  French Association  of  Real  Estate  Investment  Companies  (ASPIM) for the variation of the SRI label to real estate funds, Amundi Immobilier continued its efforts to obtain labels for its funds with  the  OPPCI  (professional  real  estate  investment  fund) Vivaldi fund in 2023.\n\n## Amundi Private Equity Funds (1)\n\nSince 2014, the ESG approach has been a lever for creating value  for  Amundi  Private  Equity  Funds  (PEF),  which  has integrated it into its investment decisions and throughout the holding period of its investments.\n\nFor  its  fund  of  funds  activity (2) ,  the  ESG  policies  of  the investment managers are carefully reviewed. They form part of  the  overall  assessment  of  an  investment  proposal.  To expand this approach during the investment period, Amundi PEF  analyses  pertinent  quantitative  and  qualitative  ESG indicators,  across  investment  managers  and  across  their underlying investments.\n\nFor its direct fund activity, the ESG  due diligence questionnaire has been revised to include new requirements:\n\n- \u00b7 greater  correlation  with  the  ESG  rating  of  listed  issuers developed by the Group;\n- \u00b7 a  response  to  increasing  regulation  (SFDR,  Taxonomy etc.);\n- \u00b7 semi-automation  of  the  tool,  in  order  to  standardise company ratings;\n- \u00b7 a  company  rating  shared  with  the  other  asset  classes covered by Amundi Real Assets (Private Debt and Impact).\n\nThis new methodology helps to accelerate the implementation  of  ESG  roadmaps  for  each  of  the  portfolio companies.  It  ensures  that  companies  fulfil  their  regulatory obligations  in  terms  of  ESG  and  assists  them  in  defining  or improving  their  CSR  strategy.  As  an  active  shareholder involved in corporate governance, Amundi PEF (direct funds) makes ESG a subject of shareholder dialogue. It ensures that ESG  issues  are  addressed  by  the  Board  of  Directors  or Supervisory  Board  and  that  the  company  makes  progress throughout the investment period. Our commitment approach  involves  recommendations  covering  periods  that vary in length, adapted to the company and its sector.\n\n## Economic, Social and Solidarity Impact\n\nIn  2023,  Amundi  continued  to  reinforce  its  social  and solidarity impact investment activity in line with its ambition, announced in 2018, to become the sector leader. The Amundi Finance  et  Solidarit\u00e9  fund  celebrated  its  tenth  anniversary this  year,  confirming  its  position  as  a  leader  in  social  and solidarity  impact  investment  in  France,  with  assets  under management of \u20ac509 million at the end of December 2023.\n\nThe investment themes have a core focus on \"taking care\" of people, by giving them access to proper housing, recognised work, appropriate care and suitable training. They also focus on  \"taking  care\"  of  the  planet:  preservation  of  land  and natural  resources  as  well  as  development  of  the  circular economy.  Environmental  impact  and  social  impact  are closely  linked.  A  combination  of  the  two  is  a  guarantee  of greater social cohesion.\n\nAmundi Finance et Solidarit\u00e9 invests mainly in companies in the  social  and  solidarity  economy  (SSE),  by  supporting  the change  in  size  and  scaling  up.  The  website  https:// amundi.oneheart.fr provides details of each of the companies financed  and  follows  their  developments  throughout  the year. Finally, the Partners Club, organised every year by the investment  team,  allows  our  entire  ecosystem  to  meet, launch common ideas and develop synergies.",

        "page_content": "## Amundi Private Debt\n\nConsideration of ESG criteria is an integral part of the private debt  investment  process,  from  the  investment  selection phase and until the loans and bonds mature.\n\nEach opportunity presented to the Investment Committee is subject to due diligence on the ESG risks identified and the improvement commitments made by the company. This due diligence informs the credit analysis, carried out simultaneously. ESG due diligence is carried out by the AARA ESG team, in collaboration with the ESG Research team and the  Private  Debt  investment  team.  It  includes  sending  out ESG  questionnaires,  discussions  with  management  and reviews  of  sector-specific  studies  by  non-financial  rating agencies. It is also an opportunity for the Private Debt team to  engage  with  businesses,  helping  them  to  improve  their environmental and social practices.\n\nIn  2022  and  2023,  the  Private  Debt  team  launched  and participated with the ESG team in market working groups, in particular  on  the  theme  of  Sustainability-Linked Loans (financing whose margin is partly indexed to ESG indicators) allowing the creation and dissemination of a reference guide reflecting the ESG ambition that Amundi Private Debt seeks to defend through these new instruments, under the aegis of France Invest (1) .\n\nThe year 2023 was an opportunity to strengthen the policy of engagement with issuers and to continue the deployment of strategies  focused  on  the  impact  and  improvement  of  ESG practices within the Private Debt activity, such as the launch of the  impact  investment  strategy  Amundi  Ambition  Agri  Agro Direct  Lending  Europe  which  has  a  fundraising  objective  of \u20ac750  million.  The  fund  aims  to  finance  the  transition  of  the European agriculture and agri-food sector.\n\nFinally, in the fields of real estate debt, cooperation with the AARA  and  Amundi  Immobilier  ESG  teams  has  made  it possible  to  better  integrate  sustainability  issues  into  the selection  and  management of outstandings by means of an ESF rating on the underlying real estate as well as at the level of the equity sponsor.\n\n## Amundi Transition \u00c9nerg\u00e9tique\n\nAmundi Transition Energ\u00e9tique (ATE) is an asset management  company  that  was  created  in  2016  and  is dedicated to green infrastructure and the energy transition. It promotes a robust and sustainable energy model in the face of  the  challenges  of  energy  supply,  changes  in  prices, resource depletion and environmental protection.\n\nIn  2023,  ATE  revised  and  updated  its  Responsible  Investor Policy  to  incorporate  the  new  provisions  of  European Regulation  (EU)  2019/2088  known  as Sustainable  Finance Disclosure (SFDR) concerning sustainability-related disclosures  in  the  financial  services  sector.  The  inclusion  of sustainability risks has therefore been  made  explicit. Similarly, negative sustainability impact indicators have been added to the information collected from investee companies.\n\nEach year, ATE publishes an impact report for the investors of each of the funds under management. The reports present the relevant ESG indicators for the last and previous financial years.  The  2023  reports  have  been  enhanced  with  new indicators and information related to the SFDR.\n\n## The central place of non-financial criteria in the management of Amundi Alternatives & Real Assets (\"AARA\")\n\nAt the heart of Amundi's strategy, responsible investment is implemented  within  the  6  areas  of  expertise  of  Amundi Alternatives & Real Assets, which offer a wide range of funds ranging from funds with a strong ESG policy to impact funds. The implementation of this ESG policy is the result of close and  ongoing  cooperation  between  the  ESG  resources  and the different investment teams. Within Amundi Alternatives & Real Assets, the development of impact investment is part of responsible investment with an initial focus on social impact that is increasingly taking an environmental direction as well; indeed, it is our firm belief that the environmental and social dimensions are closely linked.\n\nThese  ESG  criteria  are  taken  into  account  through  5  key stages in the life of a product:\n\n## Exclusion policy\n\nAmundi Alternatives & Real Assets applies targeted exclusion rules in line with those of the Group's exclusion policy.\n\nIn  addition,  the  nuclear  sector  is  also  excluded  from  the expertise of Amundi Transition \u00c9nerg\u00e9tique.\n\n## Selection policy\n\nDuring  the  asset  selection  phase,  the  preliminary  review ensures that the investment team focuses exclusively on the sectors  permitted  by  the  responsible  investment  policy  for the asset class, fund or mandate. Additional exclusions may be applied in the prospectuses of certain funds depending on the strategy targeted by the fund.\n\n## Due diligence\n\nIn addition to the exclusion policy applied as a first filter, any opportunity  received  and  presented  to  the  investment committee  is  subject  to  ESG  due  diligence  which  allows  a thorough  analysis  of  the  non-financial  risks  identified.  This due diligence is  an  integral  part  of  the  analysis  criteria  and makes it possible to complete the financial analysis, carried out concurrently.\n\nESG due diligence is carried out by all expert assessments, in collaboration if necessary, with Amundi's ESG experts.\n\n## Investment decision\n\nThe  investment  decision  process  and  the  investment memorandum of each expert assessment always include the results of the ESG due diligence. The teams of each fund are particularly  attentive  to  the  opportunities  and  ways  of reducing  the  carbon  footprint  of  the  assets.  The  ESG dimension is an integral part of the investment decision.\n\n## Holding period\n\nWhere possible during the holding period, each manager or investment manager shall maintain an ongoing dialogue with the companies  and/or  portfolio  asset  managers.  This privileged  relationship  is  used  for  the  monitoring  of  action plans and the improvement of ESG performance. Management teams have two responsible investor priorities: periodically reviewing the non-financial performance of their portfolio assets and conducting carbon footprint assessments. Each expert has also developed practices and action plans specific to its investment universe.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

It  supports  the  various  asset  management  activities, which integrate responsible investment into every aspect of their  work:  analysis  and  rating  of  companies,  engagement and  voting,  integration  of  ESG  factors  and  design  of sustainable investment solutions, key sustainability indicators for  portfolios,  ESG  promotion,  and  participation  in  industry projects and initiatives.\n\n## ESG COO Office Team\n\nThis  team  coordinates  the  projects  of  the  Responsible Investment business line with the Group's support functions, which produces dashboards for business monitoring  (business,  budget,  IT,  audit,  projects)  and oversees major cross-functional projects.\n\n## ESG Research, Engagement and Voting Team\n\nThis international team is present in Paris, London, Singapore, Beijing and Tokyo. ESG analysts cover ESG topics from each industry and major investment segments (sovereign issuers, sustainable bonds, etc.). They assess their sustainability risks and opportunities as well as negative exposure to sustainability factors, select the associated KPIs (1) and assign the  appropriate  weights  in  the  proprietary  ESG  rating system.  ESG  analysts  work  with  the  Corporate  Governance team  composed  of  specialists  dedicated  to  voting  and conducting  the  pre-assembled  dialogue.  These  specialists exercise  the  voting  rights  attached  to  the  securities  held  in the  portfolio  that  Amundi  manages  on  behalf  of  its  clients. ESG  analysts  and  corporate  governance  analysts  meet, engage  and  maintain  a  constant  dialogue  with  companies with the aim of improving their ESG practices and impacts. Team  members  actively  work  with  portfolio  managers  and financial  analysts  to  build  ESG  know-how  and  expertise across  the  Group,  including  cultivating  and  practising ambitious  and  impactful  engagement  with  issuers  across different investment platforms.\n\n## \"ESG Method and Solutions\" Team\n\nThis  team  of  quantitative  analysts  and  financial  engineers ensures the development and maintenance (in collaboration with  the  ESG  research  team  and  the  ESG  Global  Data Management  team)  of  Amundi's  proprietary  ESG  rating system. These specialists drive the integration and development of ESG ratings and ESG solutions. They enable analysts and portfolio managers to integrate ESG considerations and  sustainability into their investment decisions,  as  well  as  commercial  development  teams  to create innovative investment solutions by integrating sustainability-related data  into  financial  products  (ESG ratings,  climate  data,  impact  measures,  controversies,  etc.). They  oversee  the  development  and  integration  of  ESG analytical  tools  into  Amundi's  portfolio  management  and client reporting systems.\n\n## Business Development and ESG Advocacy Team\n\nPresent  in  Paris,  Munich,  Tokyo,  Milan  and  Hong  Kong,  the objective of this team is to support and develop the range of ESG  solutions  adapted  to  the  needs  and  challenges  of investors,  in  collaboration  with  investment  platforms  and marketing units. It provides responsible investment expertise, advice and services to all Amundi clients and partners. Team members contribute to the internal  and  external  promotion of responsible investment and oversee Amundi's engagement in responsible finance initiatives.  They  develop training programs for clients and employees.\n\n## ESG Regulatory Strategy Team\n\nWithin the ESG department, this team is responsible for ESG regulatory  issues.  It  supports  Amundi's  development  by anticipating  the  impact  of  future  ESG  regulations,  and contributes to the financial sector's work on the continuous strengthening  of  the  ESG  investment  framework  in  all jurisdictions.\n\n## Deployment of resources dedicated to our ESG and climate commitments\n\nThe industry's methodological and analytical frameworks are still incomplete. They develop as scientific and technological advances are made in understanding the impacts of climate change.  The  need  for  research  is  also  crucial  so  that  our investment  professionals  can  make  informed  decisions  and so  that  climate  issues  can  be  incorporated  into  investment strategies.\n\nAmundi  has  a  sustainable  qualitative  and  quantitative research  system  focused  on  the  analysis  of  risks  and opportunities  related  to  the  major  ESG  issues  (including climate  and  carbon  neutrality  goals),  and  their  impacts  on macroeconomic  scenarios,  the  different  sectors  and  on companies.\n\nTo this end, Amundi invests in data and the development of decision-making tools. In order for its investment professionals to have access to the information they need to make informed decisions, Amundi significantly expanded its coverage  by  increasing  the  number  of  ESG  data  providers. Amundi  has  also  stepped  up  its  investment  in  IT  systems over the past few years. In particular, the management tool ALTO*  has  been  enhanced  by  more  efficient  calculation engines and a set of new climate and ESG functionalities.\n\nAmundi  is  strengthening  the  teams  both  in  terms  of  the integration  and  processing  of  climate-related  non-financial data  and  in  terms  of  technology,  and  plans  to  continue enhance analytical coverage by incorporating functionalities designed by our internal experts.",

        "page_content": "## 3.2.4.5 A policy of continuous training for all employees\n\nIn  order  for  each  employee  to  fully  participate  in  the company's development, Amundi supports them in understanding and implementing the Responsible Investment strategy.\n\nTo  this  end,  it  has  set  up  a  training  and  support  system covering  a  wide  range  of  subjects  to  familiarise  them  with Responsible  Investment  in  general  and  to  understand  how Amundi  operates  as  a  responsible  investor.  This  system covers definitions, stakeholders, regulations, social, environmental and governance (ESG) challenges, and details the  missions  of  Amundi's  ESG  research,  ESG  policies  and proprietary methodologies as well as the dedicated tools.\n\nThese  different  topics  are  presented  in  the  form  of compulsory e-learning training, but also webinars, videos or other educational materials.\n\nThe Responsible Investment business line, the training team and the Amundi Institute all contribute to the production of this  content,  which  is  made  available  on  the  \"ESG  Suite\" digital  platform  managed  by  the  Responsible  Investment team.\n\nThis system was enhanced by the launch of the programme \"Responsible  Investment  Training\".  Launched  at  the  end  of 2022  and  rolled  out  in  2023,  this  programme  offers dedicated  training  courses  by  business  line.  The  training journeys  are  based  around  a  common  set  of  compulsory training units. They are enriched by modules whose content\n\nand  level  of  expertise  are  adapted  to  the  needs  and expectations of the business lines concerned. These training journeys  designed  jointly  by  the  Responsible  Investment, Training and CSR teams and the business lines, aim to help employees  understand  Amundi's  responsible  investment strategy, particularly the Climate Strategy, so that everyone can make a full contribution at their own level. In 2023, this course  was  enriched  with  in-depth  e-learning  on  climate, videos  and  a  detailed  memo  on  sustainable  finance regulations as well as tutorials.\n\nFurthermore, particular attention is paid to training Amundi's senior executives so that they have the knowledge required to ensure a robust and effective implementation of Amundi's responsible investment strategy.\n\nIn  2023,  100%  of  Amundi  employees (1) were  trained  in responsible investment, in accordance with the commitment made in the Say-on-Climate.\n\nIn addition to training, employees also receive expert support (in particular the Responsible  Investment  team,  \"ESG champions)  to  help  them  implement  good  responsible investment  practices.  The  \"ESG  champions\"  within  the management platforms serve as ambassadors of responsible investment issues for their colleagues and are key contributors to cross-functional projects related to responsible investment (e.g. the definition of the Sustainable Investment Framework).\n\n## 3.2.5 A stronger commitment to Amundi's other stakeholders\n\nFirst  of  all,  Amundi  is  committed  to  its  issuers.  We  define engagement  as  a  process  separate  from  our  traditional dialogues with companies. The main objective of engagement is to influence companies' activities or actions, guiding them to improve their ESG practices or to have an impact  on  key  topics  related  to  sustainable  development. Amundi is also committed to helping its clients in their own efforts to align their investment portfolios with the Net Zero trajectory. In this context, Amundi is making its research on climate  challenges  and Net  Zero trajectories  available  to them. It organises training on ESG and Net Zero topics. It is gradually  offering  its  Institutional  clients  the  opportunity  to manage their portfolios with a view to alignment.\n\nAmundi  sees  collaboration  with  its  peers  as  a  way  to contribute to best practices in its ecosystem and is actively involved  in  initiatives  that  are  essential  to  improve  market standards,  such  as Taskforce  on  Nature-related  Financial Disclosure (TNFD)  and  the High  Level  Expert  Group  on Sustainable  Finance (HLEG).  Lastly,  to  better  contribute  to the empowerment of its clients on climate issues, and as part of  its  Ambitions  ESG  2025  plan,  Amundi  announced  the launch  of  ALTO  Sustainability,  a  technological  analysis  and decision-making solution for investors on environmental and societal issues.\n\nAmundi  Technology  thus  strengthens  its  support  for responsible investment and sustainable finance. ALTO  Sustainability  is  an  innovative  modular  solution  that provides  clients  with  additional  flexibility  and  helps  them align  investment  decisions  with  their  ESG  and  Climate objectives. It will allow users to:\n\n- \u00b7 integrate  their  own  ESG  data  and  analytics  into  ALTO* Investment;\n- \u00b7 integrate third-party ESG data and benefit from a service of control and quality of this data by the Amundi teams;\n- \u00b7 build customised scores at issuer and/or portfolio level;\n- \u00b7 use ESG, climate, biodiversity  and  SFDR  data  throughout the  asset  management  value  chain:  portfolio  analysis, simulation, pre-trade and post-trade controls of investment rules, production of reports;\n- \u00b7 follow  the Net  Zero trajectory  of  portfolios  with  ALTO Dashboard.\n\nALTO  Sustainability  will  facilitate  the  implementation  of regulatory  reporting  obligations.  This  will  allow  investment professionals  to  effectively  implement  ESG  investment strategies.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

All  its  policies  and  reports  in  the  area  of  responsible investment and the climate can be consulted on its website.\n\n## 3.2.6.1 Voting and Responsible Investment Policies\n\nThe manner in which Amundi integrates the climate challenge and ESG issues into its investment policy, as well as the policy relating to its use of voting rights, is set out in various documents:\n\n- \u00b7 the  responsible  investment  policy  sets  out  Amundi's  approach  in  this  area,  including  a  description  of  our  ESG  assessment methodology, which comprises several climate-related components, and its exclusion policy;\n- \u00b7 the voting policy sets out the principles that guide our voting activity, and in particular how we integrate both ESG and climate issues. This policy is published in advance of the voting campaign.\n\n## 3.2.6.2 Continuously adapt to sustainable finance regulations (MIFID 2, SFDR, etc.)\n\nAmundi welcomes new regulations to build a strong and transparent responsible investment market, with ESG issues becoming increasingly important, especially in Europe. The group adapts its strategies, marketing, information systems and organisation to best  serve  its  clients  in  a  more  demanding  regulatory  environment.  For  example,  for  the  implementation  of  MIFID  2,  specific governance was put in place to complete the sustainable preference questionnaires and trainings were organised throughout the year 2023.\n\n## 3.2.6.3 The Engagement and Voting reports\n\nThe Engagement and Voting Reports summarise the campaigns conducted by Amundi in its shareholder dialogue, and the use of its voting rights (individual votes are also published on its website).\n\nIn addition, Amundi publishes an annual Stewardship report, approved by the FRC (Financial Reporting Council) , reviewing how it responds to the various Stewardship codes to which it is a signatory.\n\n## 3.2.6.4 The Climate and Sustainability Report\n\nThe Climate and Sustainability Report meets the requirements of Article 29 of the Climate Energy Law and the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD Report). This annual report aims to increase the transparency of our  activities  and  non-financial  practices.  It  reports  on  Amundi's  responsible  investment  strategy  as  well  as  its  progress  on climate and biodiversity issues.\n\n## 3.2.7 Amundi's climate strategy\n\n## 3.2.7.1 Status update\n\nIn  line  with  the  commitment  made  in  the  Ambitions  ESG 2025  plan,  Amundi  submitted  its  climate  strategy  to  a consultative  vote  of  its  shareholders  at  its  2022  General Shareholders'  Meeting.  This  \"Say  on  Climate\"  resolution received 97.7% of votes in favour.\n\nIn  line  with  the  best  practice  of  reporting  annually  on  the state of implementation of the Climate Strategy, at its 2023 General Shareholders' Meeting Amundi submitted an ex post \"Say  on  Climate\"  resolution,  detailing  the  progress  made during  the  first  financial  year  of  implementation  2022.  This resolution was approved by 98.26% of the vote.\n\nAt  its  2024  General  Shareholders'  Meeting,  Amundi  will present  an ex  post \"Say  on  Climate\"  resolution,  setting  out the  progress  made  during  the  financial  year  2023.  A  table detailing  the  progress  made  point  by  point  is  provided below.\n\nIn addition to its climate strategy associated with the \"Say on Climate,\" Amundi had clarified in 2022 its commitment as a member of the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative .",

Through  the  Glasgow  Financial  Alliance  for  Net  Zero,, the financial sector has committed to a common goal: to use its  own  resources  to  support  a  low-carbon  global  economy and meet the objectives of the Paris Agreements.\n\nAware  of  the  challenges  and  the  means  required  for deployment, Amundi believes that shareholders must be fully informed  of  the  way  in  which  companies  intend  to contribute to this collective effort.\n\nAs a shareholder, Amundi therefore strongly encourages the companies  in  which  it  invests  to  submit  their  climate strategy to a consultative vote at their General Shareholders' Meetings.\n\nAs  a  listed  company,  Amundi  also  believes  that  it  has  a responsibility  to  be  transparent  with  its  shareholders  about its climate strategy.\n\nIn  addition,  the  presentation  of  this  strategy,  its  ambitions and  its  annual  progress  is  an  exercise  that  we  believe  is essential to a balanced dialogue with shareholders.\n\nGiven that hareholders may have multiple motives at the time of such a vote, we state that in the event that the resolution is not adopted, the Board of Directors would use any means at its disposal to discuss with and gather information from its shareholders  regarding  the  reasons  behind  their  decision not to the proposed draft resolution, should it occur. It would inform  all  its  shareholders  of  the  outcome  of  this  process and  put  forward  the  measures  to  take  into  consideration these conclusions.\n\nTherefore, Amundi wishes to submit its climate strategy to the annual consultative vote at its 2022 General Shareholders' Meeting. From 2023, Amundi will also request a  consultative  vote  on  the  progress  made  in  implementing this strategy.\n\n## Amundi's approach: a progressive and evolving process\n\nAware  of  its  responsibility  and  obligations  to  the  clients  it invests  for,  Amundi  must  adopt  a progressive  approach in setting  the  ambitions  of  a  long-term  climate  strategy, with intermediate steps .\n\nDetermining  a  company's  alignment  with  the  objectives  of the  Paris  Agreement  remains  a  challenge  to  date.  Scientific knowledge and methodologies continue to grow and evolve. The broad spectrum of asset classes and regions of the world in  which  Amundi  invests  does  not  yet  benefit  from  the analytical frameworks and data necessary for a comprehensive  action  plan.  Nevertheless,  the  means  can already be deployed.\n\nAmundi's Climate strategy will therefore evolve in line with methodological developments, protocols for defining ambitions, regulatory frameworks and the data available for assessing alignment with a 2050 carbon neutrality objective.\n\nIn  addition,  recent  circumstances,  linked  to  the  conflict  in Ukraine, will have consequences for the evolution of energy systems. In particular, they require a strengthening of energy independence  in  Europe  as  in  all  the  countries  in  which Amundi invests. While it is too early to measure the impact, short-term  adjustments  in  energy  trajectories  are  likely  and will  influence  the  strategy  of  progressive  alignment  of investment portfolios.\n\nWhile the financial system can in no way substitute for action by  States  and  governments  to  combat  the  climate  crisis, Amundi nevertheless considers that it is part of the solution.\n\nBased  on  our  commitment  to  climate  issues  and  our responsibility  to  our  clients,  Amundi's  climate  strategy  is dynamic and steady, with shortand medium-term objectives.\n\nIt is based on three convictions:\n\n- 1. the  need  for  a  scientific  approach : transition  is  a fundamental  issue  that  calls  for  an  industrial  revolution based  on  both  established  scientific  findings  and  the development of proven technological solutions;\n- 2. the  need  to  support  the  transition  of  the  companies in which  Amundi  invests  rather  than  excluding  them  or divesting from them, a method which must be restricted to businesses  that  compromise  this  transition.  The transition  involves  supporting  the  transformation  of  high carbon-emitting business models into models of decarbonised development;\n- 3. the  search  for  social  and  economic  progress :  Amundi believes that the transition can only happen if it is socially acceptable.",

        "page_content": "In addition to joining the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative, Amundi is putting in place a Climate 2022-2025 Action Plan based on three key mechanisms :\n\n- 1. the  integration  of  climate  change  within  its  business operations ,  namely  the  resources  implemented  within  its organisation, the alignment of its employees, its governance  and  its  commitments  to  reducing  direct greenhouse gas emissions;\n\n## Amundi's commitments\n\n- 2. the integration of climate change within its management for third parties ,  describing its commitments with regard to savings and investment solutions;\n- 3. the  integration  of  climate  change  within  its  actions targeting the businesses in which  it is invested , describing  its  exclusion  policy,  shareholder  dialogue  and policy  on  the  use  of  voting  rights  in  order  to  acc  the transition of these businesses to a decarbonised business model  associated  with  the  objectives  of  the  Paris Agreement.\n\n## 1. Integrating climate change into Amundi's business operations aimed at aligning stakeholders with a transparent climate strategy\n\n## A. Putting climate at the centre of governance, aligning and empowering\n\n## Role of the Board of Directors\n\nAt  the  end  of  2020,  the  Board  of  Directors  decided  to integrate social and environmental issues within its governance.  Since  May  2021,  the  Board  has  been  analysing the progress made against key climate and ESG indicators on at  least  a  quarterly  basis.  Concerned  with  developing  their skills  in  this  area,  every  year  since  2020  members  of  the Board  have  received  training  on  topics  related  to  climate issues.\n\nLastly, for the first year in 2021, a one-day strategic seminar allowed members of the Board to focus on the strategy to be deployed in this area and to develop specific ways in which to implement the new ESG Ambition 2025 Plan.\n\nIn implementing governance, the Board is also supported by its Strategic and CSR Committee, chaired by an independent director  who  annually  reviews  the  progress  made  in  the Annual  Report  with  regard  to  social,  environmental  and societal  data,  including  that  related  to  climate  issues, constituting Chapter 3 of the Universal Registration Document.\n\nIn  2021,  and  through  its  work  on  strategy,  it  was  asked  to recommend  to  the  Board  of  Directors  the  adoption  of  the Group's plan relating to strategic climate and ESG ambitions.\n\nIn  the  future,  the  Strategy  and  CSR  Committee  will  also check the quality of Amundi's progress of Amundi's report on the climate and ESG strategy.\n\nGovernance  implemented  at  Board  level  is  also  part  of  the Company's internal organisation.\n\n## ESG & Climate Strategic Committee\n\nThis  monthly  Committee,  chaired  by  the  Chief  Executive Officer, defines and validates the ESG and climate policy thus applicable  to  investments,  as  well  as  Amundi  Group's strategic guidelines in this area. Its purpose is to:\n\n- \u00b7 manage, monitor and validate Amundi's ESG and Climate strategy in terms of investment;\n- \u00b7 validate the strategic guidelines of the responsible investment policy and the voting policy;\n- \u00b7 manage the main strategic projects.\n\nThis  Committee  draws  upon  the  ESG  Rating  Committee, chaired by the Director of the ESG Department, in charge of the responsible investment policy and associated methodologies, and on the Voting Committee, chaired by a member  of  senior  management  in  charge  of  the  voting policy.\n\n## Employee Alignment System, through a new compensation policy\n\nThe  implementation  of  the  climate  strategy  can  only  be achieved by raising awareness among  all Amundi's stakeholders  and  by  aligning  the  employee  compensation policy with Amundi's ESG and climate strategy. This decision is currently being rolled out.\n\nThus,  the  integration  of  ESG  and  climate  criteria  into  the compensation policy will be done in two stages:\n\n- \u00b7 As  of  2022,  and  subject  to  approval  by  the  General Shareholders'  Meeting,  the  performance  evaluation  and compensation of the Chief Executive Officer will take into account  ESG  and  CSR  objectives  up  to  20%.  In  addition, the  implementation  of  the  Ambitions  ESG  2025  plan  will account for 20% of the criteria supporting the performance share plan for Amundi's 200 senior managers;\n- \u00b7 from  2022  onwards,  Amundi  will  progressively  integrate ESG  objectives  into  the  performance  evaluation  of  sales representatives  and  portfolio  managers,  so  that  the determination of their variable compensation includes this dimension.\n\n## B. Setting objectives for reducing direct emissions\n\n## Aligning the CSR Policy with 2050 Net Zero Challenges\n\nAs part of its Ambitions ESG 2025 Plan, Amundi has set itself two  objectives  for  controlling  its  direct  environmental footprint:\n\n- \u00b7 a 30% reduction in its CO2 emissions per FTE from energy consumption  (scopes  1  and  2)  and  from  business  travel (scope 3), between now and 2025 in comparison with the 2018 reference year;\n- \u00b7 elements relating to climate change and aiming to reduce the  carbon  footprint  generated  by  purchasing  (scope  3) will  be  included  in  the  purchasing  policy  from  2022. Suppliers  will  also  be  called  on  to  assess  their  CO2 emissions, with a view to setting decarbonisation targets.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Deploying the resources necessary to achieve the objectives\n\n## Deployment of resources dedicated to our ESG and\n\n## climate commitments\n\nIn a  context  where  the  methodological  and  analytical frameworks at industry level are still only partial, building up as and when scientific advances and technologies are made available for understanding the impact of climate change, the need  for  research  is  crucial  so  that  our  investment professionals  can  make  informed  decisions  and  so  that climate issues can be incorporated into investment strategies.\n\nAs such, Amundi has almost doubled the size of its ESG team over  the  past  three  years,  reaching  40  employees,  and  its target  is  to  increase  it  by  a  furhter  40%  in  2022,  thereby strengthening  its  research  programme  efforts  in  terms  of analysing  the  risks  and  opportunities  related  to  the  climate and  the  carbon  neutrality  objectives  at  macroeconomic scenario, sector and business level. Although it is already part of  our  ESG  sector  analysis  for  the  sectors  that  are  highly exposed  to  climate  change,  it  remains  dependent  on available data and credible net zero trajectory methodologies.  Amundi  therefore  allocates  resources  to continuing  its  research  efforts  in  order  to  improve  theses analyses.\n\nTo supplement and complement this effort, Amundi invests massively  in  data  and  the  development  of  decision-making tools. In order for investment professionals to have access to the  information  necessary  to  make  informed  decisions, Amundi  has  significantly  expanded  its  data  coverage  by increasing  the  number  of  ESG  data  providers  from  4  to  14, thus giving access to 100 million items of non-financial data per month. Furthermore, Amundi has increased the IT budget fivefold over  the  last  three  years.  In  particular, the management  tool  has  been  enhanced  by  more  efficient calculation  engines  and  a  set  of  new  climate  and  ESG functionalities.\n\nAmundi  is  strengthening  the  teams  both  in  terms  of  the integration  and  processing  of  non-financial  data  and  at  IT level,  and  plans  to  enhance  analytical  equipment  on  climate issues  on  a  continuous  basis  by  incorporating  functionalities designed by our internal experts.\n\n## Continuous training of employees\n\nWhile  it  is  necessary  to  engage  Amundi's  entire  workforce and roles in the implementation of this climate strategy, the training  issue  is  key  and  should  complement  the  resource strengthening plans.\n\nIn  2021,  several  training  sessions  were  held  on  climate,  net zero and ESG  issues more  globally for investment professionals. An enhanced training offer was made available to all staff and implemented during the year.\n\nFrom 2022 onwards, a climate and ESG training programme created  with  Amundi  experts  and  covering  all  staff  will  be implemented,  with  modules  tailored  to  different  levels  of expertise, to ensure that over time every employee receives bespoke climate and ESG training.\n\nIn addition, ensuring that senior executives and members of key  committees  have  the  necessary  climate  knowledge  is essential to enabling the robust, high-quality implementation of  climate  strategy.  Amundi  is  thus  developing  a  specific training programme for this audience.\n\n## Contribution to industry efforts\n\nAmundi  values  collaboration  with  its  peers  as  a  way  to contribute  to  best  practices  in  its  ecosystem.  Amundi  is actively  involved  in  industry  initiatives  that  are  essential  for improving industry standards (1) .\n\nFurthermore,  Amundi  is  committed  to  helping  its  clients  as they align their investment portfolios. To this end, Amundi is making  available  its  research (2) and  education  documents relating  to  the  climate  challenge  and  the  terms  of  net  zero trajectories, and is gradually offering its existing institutional clients  the  opportunity  to  manage  their  portfolios  with alignment in mind.\n\nLastly, to better contribute to the empowerment of its clients on  climate  issues,  and  as  part  of  its  Ambition  2025  Plan, Amundi  announced  the  launch  of  Alto  Sustainability,  a technological  analysis  and  decision-making  solution  for investors on environmental and societal issues.\n\n## D. Implementing this strategy in a fully transparent manner\n\nTransparency  remains  the  cornerstone  of  our  approach  to implementing this strategy. All our policies and reports relating to ESG and the climate can be consulted on our website (3) .\n\n## Voting and Responsible Investment Policies\n\nThe  manner  in  which  Amundi  integrates  the  climate challenge and ESG issues within its investment policy, as well as  within  its  use  of  voting  rights,  is  explained  in  various documents:\n\n- \u00b7 the  responsible  investment  policy  sets  out  Amundi's approach to responsible investment, including a description  of  our  ESG  assessment  methodology,  which comprises  several  climate-related  components,  and  our exclusion policy;\n- \u00b7 the  voting  policy (4) sets  out  the  principles  that  guide  our voting,  and  in  particular  how  we  integrate  both  ESG  and climate issues.\n\n## The Stewardship Report\n\nThis report, which meets the standards of the UK Stewardship Code as well as other similar codes (in particular the Japanese, Australian,  Canadian  and  Italian  codes),  provides  an  annual summary  of  actions  implemented  in  the  delegation  of management for third  parties  in  order  to  fully  enhance  our clients' interests. The Engagement Report and Voting Report, both published annually, summarise the campaigns conducted by  Amundi  in  its  shareholder  dialogue,  and  the  use  of  its voting rights (votes also published on our website (5) ).\n\n## The Climate Report - TCFD\n\nThis annual report, which meets the requirements of the TCFD (Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures), describes the governance structure in place to address climate issues, risk management and initiatives  aimed  to  support  transitions  to  a low-carbon economy.",

Integrating climate change into its management for third parties\n\nAmundi works proactively to speed up the alignment of its investments  with  the  Net  Zero  by  2050  target,  thus contributing to the collective effort required for the transition to a low-carbon economy. Although Amundi has a policy of excluding issuers exposed to certain activities, its philosophy  is  clearly  to  accompany,  support  and  influence the transition of issuers in order to have a positive impact on the  real  economy. To  do  so,  Amundi  has  developed  and intends to continue developing a wide range of actions.\n\n## A. Systematically incorporating the assessment of the transition into actively managed open-ended funds\n\nAmundi has developed its own ESG rating methodologies to measure  an  issuer's non-financial performance, which specifically  include  climate-related  performance  indicators, selected  according  to  sector  and  the  materiality  of  their impact. Since 2021, all (1) actively managed open-ended funds have incorporated an ESG rating target exceeding that of the investment universe.\n\nAs part of its Ambition 2025 Plan, Amundi announced that it wanted to  further  integrate  non-financial  objectives  into  its active portfolio management in relation to the climate issue. Accordingly,  Amundi  is  working  on  establishing  a  rating methodology  to  assess,  based  on  a  best-in-class  approach, the transition efforts undertaken by issuers in service of the Net  Zero  scenario,  particularly  efforts  to  decarbonise  their business  and  develop  green  activities.  By  2025,  the  stated objective of the portfolios in question will be to have a better environmental transition profile than their benchmark investment universe.\n\n## B. Developing Net Zero 2050 transition funds on major asset classes\n\nBy  2025,  Amundi  will  also  offer  open-ended  funds  for  all major asset classes asset classes, open-ended funds for the transition  to  the  Net  Zero  2050  objective.  By  providing  an active  range  of  transition  funds,  Amundi  aims  to  guide savings towards investment solutions that will support issuer transitions, while offering our clients the means to align their portfolios  with  the  net  zero  commitments  they  have  made. Savers will thus have the choice of investing their savings in funds that fully incorporate this net zero transition objective. Amundi  is  also  continuing  to  develop  its  passive  climate management range.\n\n## C. Contributing to the energy transition financing effort\n\nA sharp increase in capital and R&D spending is needed if we are to reach the Net Zero by 2050 target. To contribute to this  financing,  Amundi  has  over  the  past  three  years, accelerated  its  development  of  innovative  solutions  to finance climate-friendly developments  and  the  energy transition.  These  solutions  are  part  of  a  range  of  financial innovations  and  strategic  partnerships  with  major  public institutions  to  generate  both  supply  and  demand  for  new green  financing  projects.  At  the  end  of  2021,  green  bond solutions totalled \u20ac5.3bn, covering developed and emerging markets.\n\nIn 2022, Amundi will continue its efforts to develop solutions aimed  at  investing  in  businesses  or  financing  projects  that make a positive environmental contribution.\n\n## 3. Integrating climate change into its actions targeting businesses in order to accelerate their transition towards to a carbon-free business model\n\nConvinced  that  we  must  support  the  transition  of  the businesses we invest in, rather than encouraging divestment, our  action  plan  for  issuers  is  based  on  the  rollout  of ambitious means in terms of \"engagement\", to help support them  and  to  back  the  necessary  transformations  towards decarbonised  development  models.  Accordingly,  the  use  of exclusion  policies  linked  to  climate  issues  is  considered relevant  when  such  policies  target  businesses  exposed  to activities that jeopardise the transition.\n\nAmundi applies a range of exclusion policies, which is one of the  pillars  of  its  managerial  responsibility.  They  consist  in excluding  businesses  that  do  not  comply  with  our  ESG policy (2) ,  Activities  that  do  not  comply  with  international agreements and national recognized frameworks (3) . Moreover,  Amundi  implements  targeted  sector  exclusions specific  to  industries  that  compromise  the  achievement  of net zero objectives and the environment in general, through its shareholder investment.\n\n## Coal\n\nAs coal is the largest single contributor to human-induced climate change,  Amundi  has  implemented  a  sector-specific  policy  on thermal  coal  since  2016,  resulting  in  the  exclusion  of  certain companies  and  issuers.  Every  year  since  2016,  Amundi  has gradually strengthened its coal exclusion policy. In 2020, Amundi\n\nfurther extended its exclusion policy to any company developing or planning to develop new thermal coal operating capacities.\n\nAccordingly, today Amundi excludes (4) :\n\n- \u00b7 businesses developing or planning to develop new thermal coal  capacities  (producers,  mining  companies,  power stations, transport infrastructures);\n- \u00b7 companies  earning  more  than  25%  of  their  revenue  from thermal coal mining;\n- \u00b7 companies mining 100 MT or more of thermal coal with no intention of making reductions;\n- \u00b7 all companies whose income from thermal coal mining and thermal coal-powered electricity generation exceeds 50% of the total income without analysis;\n- \u00b7 all coal-fired electricity generation and coal mining companies  generating  between  25%  and  50%  and  with  a degraded energy transition score.\n\nAmundi is committed to being coal-free by 2030 in OECD countries  and  by  2040  in  other  countries.  To  that  end, Amundi  has  engaged  with  all  the  businesses  in  its  coalexposed  portfolios,  asking  them  to  provide  a  gradual  exit plan  by  2030/2040,  depending  on  the  location  of  their activities.  This  engagement  will  continue  and  will  be complemented by the addition of voting rights, in line with the progress made in terms of this dialogue.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Establishing an active dialogue to speed up and further urge the transformation of models\n\nA  major  pillar  in  our  vision  as  a  responsible  investor, engagement  occurs  via  discussions  between  analysts  and the businesses in which we are invested throughout the year, and through individual or collaborative engagement actions on  major  sustainable  development  issues,  in  order  to promote  real  change  and  shift  towards  an  inclusive, sustainable  and  low-carbon  economy.  Global  warming  and the  degradation  of  ecosystems,  which  threaten  to  cause destructive  chain  reactions,  are  a  priority  theme  in  our engagement campaigns.\n\nAmundi engaged with 472 and 547 businesses respectively in 2020  and  2021  on  climate  issues.  As  part  of  its  Ambition 2025  plan,  Amundi  will  begin  a  cycle  of  engagement  with 1,000 additional companies by 2025. As part of this dialogue, Amundi requests that  businesses  publish  a  detailed  climate strategy based on specific indicators and objectives for each carbon  emission  scope,  and  on  the  corresponding  capital expenditure (investment plan).\n\nIn  addition  to  the  commitment,  since  2019,  Amundi  has included the consideration of climate issues in the exercise of its  voting  rights  as  one  of  its  priority  themes,  based  the conviction  that  the  consideration  of  these  challenges  by Boards of Directors is essential for the sound management of a company.\n\nIn  this  sense,  Amundi  supports  the  resolutions  that  aim  to implement better reporting and transparency on businesses' climate strategies.\n\nThe  voting  policy  aims  to  check  that  the  compensation policies  and/or  the  compensation  reports  submitted  for voting include a non-financial component. For businesses in the  energy  sector  (oil  and  gas,  power  utilities  and  mining companies),  a  climate  criterion  must  be  included  in  the variable compensation parameters.\n\nIt  also consists of voting against the discharge of the Board or the Management, or against re-electing the Chairman and certain  Directors  within  a  scope  of  targeted  businesses, excluded from the investment universe covered by Amundi's Responsible Investment Policy or with an insufficient climate strategy  despite  operating  in  sectors  in  which  the  energy transition is critical.\n\n## B. Promoting a socially acceptable energy transition\n\nAmundi believes that the transition to a low-carbon economy must  be  inclusive  and  sustainable.  We  must  thus  consider the  social  impact  as  well  as  the  impact  on  the  preserving natural capital. Given that the impact analysis for these issues is still in its infancy, Amundi has decided to dedicate specific engagement  programmes  to  these  themes  based  on proprietary research.\n\nIn addition,  Amundi  co-founded \"Investors  for  a  Just Transition\" , the first investor coalition on the just transition in order to support collaborative efforts to rise to this complex challenge.\n\nAmundi also  launched  two  major  engagement  programmes around  the  circular  economy  and  biodiversity  (as  well  as related research) to raise issuer awareness of this topic, their exposure  and  impact,  and  to  ask  issuers  to  set  out  a  solid strategy (3) .\n\nThe  social  dimension  of  the  energy  transition  remains  an important  focus  for  Amundi,  which  will  continue  to  invest resources in terms of both research and commitment.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAmundi  will  continue  to  adjust  its  climate  strategy  in  the coming years, according to the scientific reference scenarios and in close connection with its clients'  objectives,  both  by investing  in  solutions  to  accelerate  the  transition  and  by progressively aligning its portfolios with the 2050 neutrality objective.",

        "page_content": "## 3.3 ACT IN THE INTEREST OF CLIENTS\n\nBe a trusted partner, working every day in the interest of its clients  and  of  society,  is  Amundi's  raison  d'\u00eatre.  This commitment is reflected in the desire to:\n\n- \u00b7 develop lasting relationships with all of its clients: partner networks, third-party distributors and privat banks, institutional and corporates;\n- \u00b7 offer clients a wide range of expertise, investment advice and management delegation services as well as technological solutions, adapted to their needs, preferences, risk profile and market context;\n\nTo  achieve  this  goal,  Amundi  is  implementing  a  set  of measures for clients:\n\n- \u00b7 a responsible approach in client relationships;\n- \u00b7 easily  accessible,  clear  and  transparent  Client-oriented information and local client service;\n- \u00b7 a system for preventing and controlling the risks inherent in business practices.\n- \u00b7 ensure ethics in business with independent controls.\n\n## 3.3.1 A responsible approach in its Client relationships\n\nFaced  with  the  challenges  encountered  by  all  client  segments  (e.g.  economic,  health,  geopolitical),  Amundi  stands  out  as  a responsible, attentive and proactive partner.\n\n## 3.3.1.1 A dedicated organisation by client segments\n\nAmundi,  with  its  subsidiaries  and  joint  ventures,  supports more  than  100  million  clients.  Each  large  client  segment benefits  from  dedicated  sales,  marketing  and  client  service teams,  with  strong  local  relationships,  thanks  to  Amundi's presence in 35 countries. The three main client segments are:\n\n## Partner networks in France and internationally\n\nAmundi  is  a  historical  partner  in  three  major  banking networks in France, and has established long-term partnerships with over ten or so networks in Europe and Asia.\n\n## 3.3.1.2 Listening to client expectations\n\nTo listen to its clients, Amundi has set up a system to analyse their  needs  and  their  commitment  with  associations,  to measure client satisfaction and manage their complaints.\n\n## Understanding the needs\n\nAmundi relies on listening and monitoring systems (covering market  trends,  regulatory  developments  and  competitive practices)  to  develop  offers  and  services  adapted  to  the needs  of  each  client  segment  and  integrating  the  latest technological  developments  in  the  industry.  Thus,  for example:\n\n- \u00b7 Since  2016,  Amundi  has  been  leading  a  \" Global  Board Advisory\" Committee composed of major experts external to the Group. Meeting three times a year, they discuss the global economic and geopolitical prospects, analyse their impacts  on  the  financial  markets  in  each  of  the  major geographical  areas  and  refine  the  understanding  of  the financial needs of clients in the countries where Amundi is present.\n\n## Third-party Distribution and Private Banks\n\nAmundi is engaged with wealth banks, wealth managers as well as with more than 1,000 French and foreign third-party distributors  (banks,  insurance  companies,  brokers)  who market  savings  solutions  built  by  Amundi  and  intended  for clients in their networks.\n\n## Institutions and Companies\n\nAmundi supports more than 1,500 institutional and corporate clients  on  all  continents:  asset  managers,  insurers,  central banks, companies - both for their own account management and employee savings or pension solutions -, pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, mutual funds and other institutions.\n\n- \u00b7 Amundi  carries  out  active  regulatory  monitoring,  led  in particular  by  the Public  Affairs team.  It  participates, directly  or via industry  associations,  in  the  work  and consultations around European regulatory projects, including those of sustainable finance.\n- \u00b7 The Business  Intelligence team  provides  competitive intelligence. Based in Paris, as well as in Boston, Milan and Singapore, it also works with correspondents in each of the markets  where  Amundi  is  present.  Its  productions  are accessible to employees via an intranet regularly enhanced with product studies.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\n- \u00b7 Amundi also regularly sponsors studies in order to better understand the expectations of the various client segments it  serves  and  to  monitor  their  evolution.  For  example,  in 2023, Amundi:\n- \u00b7 conducted  studies  to  analyse  the  needs  of  individual clients in terms of impact management,\n- \u00b7 renews the annual Amundi CREATE survey, launched in 2014.  More  than  150  pension  funds  were  surveyed  on the topic of responsible investment and climate change,\n- \u00b7 conducted,  as  every  year,  a  survey  of  clients  and prospects  (companies,  insurers,  pension  funds,  supranational  organisations,  etc.)  to  assess  their  experience with Amundi on five key dimensions: client relationship and  service,  commercial  activity,  brand  positioning, investment capacities and pricing,\n- \u00b7 sponsored,  as  in  previous  years,  the  OMFIF (1) Global Public  Investor  Report,  based  on  interviews  with  75 central bank reserve managers from around the world.\n\n## Cooperate with associations and stakeholders\n\nAmundi  is  active  within  an  ecosystem  of  stakeholders  to jointly create the offers best adapted to its clients. As such, it interacts in particular with professional associations (such as AFG (2) and  EFAMA (3) ), responds  to  consultations  with regulators and participates in industry initiatives.\n\nAs  part  of  its  employee  savings  and  retirement  activities, Amundi works in partnership with federations, trade unions and  associations  to  discuss  value  sharing  issues  in  the interest of employee savers. For example, Amundi cooperates  with  CIES (4) to  create  solutions  for  savers.  The entire  range  of  responsible  and  solidarity  multi-company funds is labelled by the CIES, which demonstrates Amundi's commitment to offering responsible  savings  solutions  to  all employees of Amundi client companies.\n\n## Measuring client satisfaction with the Customer Recommendation Index (IRC (5) )\n\nAmundi  conducts  IRC  (Customer  Recommendation  Index) campaigns to ensure that its clients' expectations are met.\n\nThus,  IRC  campaigns  were  conducted  with  distributor networks in six countries in 2023. More than 20,000 clients of  these  networks  were  surveyed.  Amundi's  results,  all sectors  combined,  have  been  in  the  top  range  for  several years.\n\nAmundi  also  measures  the  satisfaction  of  its  institutional clients through questionnaires sent each year to clients and prospects.  They  make  it  possible  to  assess  Amundi's perception of its competitive positioning, its client service, its investment  strategies  and  performance  as  well  as  its responsible  investor  approach,  among  others.  They  include the measure of the Net Promoter Score (NPS) (6) which aims to  understand  the  degree  of  client  engagement  with  the Amundi  brand,  measure  their  overall  satisfaction  and  the likelihood of recommending Amundi to other institutions.\n\nThis  IRC  for  institutional  clients  continues  to  increase  year after  year  and gained 14 points (7) .  This  increase  is  explained by a high rate of advocates (+10 points with more than half of  the  clients)  and  a  still  very  low  level  of  critics  (only  5%). The  majority  of  clients  confirm  a  very  good  overall experience with Amundi.\n\n## Managing complaints\n\nAs  part  of  a  process  of  continuous  improvement  of  the quality  of  service,  the  Amundi  Group  has  a  system  for managing  complaints.  It  aims  to  deal  with  its  clients' complaints  in  an  efficient,  fair  and  harmonised  manner,  in accordance  with  the  applicable  regulations.  This  system applies to all clients.\n\nThe procedures for processing complaints, contacts as well as information on the possibility of benefiting from mediation free  of  charge  (when  the  system  is  applied  locally)  are available on the external sites of Amundi and its subsidiaries.\n\nThe management of complaints is governed by periodically updated internal procedures relating to:\n\n- \u00b7 receipt and analysis of the complaint;\n- \u00b7 the  channel  for  processing  and  complying  with  the response time;\n- \u00b7 restitution and monitoring.\n\nThe  system  also  makes  it  possible  to  identify  possible shortcomings in order to implement corrective actions.\n\nMonitoring the implementation of these actions is carried out under  the  supervision  of  the  Compliance  Department.  The monitoring  of  complaints  is  integrated  into  the  Senior Management's dashboard of indicators.\n\nThe  Amundi  Group  monitors  very  closely  any  complaints received from its clients in order to improve the quality of the services and products offered.",

This  process  thus  ensures  the protection  of  the  interest  of  clients,  both  professional  and non-professional.\n\nThis governance relies on 2 key committees:\n\n## The New Activities Products ( NAP ) Committee\n\nChaired by the director of the Risks business line, it validates any new activity/new type of product developed within the Group before its development by the relevant business line or entity.\n\nThis  Committee allows all operational and control functions to approve the activity/product/service in all its components (Operations, IT, Management, Trading, Legal, Risks, Compliance,  Finance,  Marketing,  Commercial,  Responsible Investment, etc.).\n\n## 3.3.1.4 Training at all levels in the value chain\n\nTo act in the interest of its clients, Amundi seeks to increase the expertise of all  stakeholders in  the  value  chain:  Amundi employees  and  executives,  advisers  at  distributors  and partner networks, individual clients as well as employees of prospects  and  institutional  or  corporate  clients.  The  Group has comprehensive training content, which can be used \"\u00e0 la carte\" according to the each profile or profession.\n\n## In-house training\n\nAmundi  continued  to  train  its  employees  and  enriched  the transfer  of  knowledge  with,  for  example,  new  e-learning  on Responsible  Investment,  videos  on  the  regulations  of sustainable  finance,  video  conferences  on  geopolitical  and climate  risks,  currency  management,  regulatory  changes,  as well as the economic outlook for 2024.\n\nAmundi's  training  policy  is  described  in  further  detail  in chapters 3.2.4.5 and 3.4.2.3.\n\n## Training for clients of Partner Networks and Distributors\n\nAmundi offers training solutions, such as Amundi Academy , on offers, markets and services to advisors and savers. This solution integrates varied and  fun  educational  paths, accessible via a  platform.  Available  in  several  languages,  it delivers a final certification that, in some cases, can meet the request of the regulator.\n\nThe training modules allow:\n\n- \u00b7 for  partner  and  distributor  networks,  to  improve  the financial  knowledge  of  advisers  as  well  as  to  support  the marketing of Amundi funds;\n- \u00b7 for savers, to understand the main concepts of finance.\n\nIn 2023, the content was enriched and adapted to meet local demands in twelve countries.\n\nAmundi Academy offers  more  than  100  modules  with  three levels  (fundamentals,  expert  and  CFA)  and  has  more  than 13,000 users on 20 digital platforms.\n\n## The Central Products and Services ( CPS ) Committee\n\nA decision-making body, chaired each month by the director of  the Marketing  &  Products business  line,  it  validates  the creation, development of investment supports and associated services offered by Amundi.\n\nApplications for approval from the regulatory authorities are then  processed  before  the  marketing  teams  deploy  all  the necessary resources.\n\nAll  products,  services  and  activities  of  all  Group  entities,  in France and internationally, are concerned.\n\nIts  members  include,  in  particular,  the  heads  of  the  Risk, Legal,  Compliance,  Management,  Finance,  Strategy  and Responsible Investment business lines as well as the project sponsor.\n\nAt  the  same  time,  Amundi  has  a  process  for  validating dedicated  funds  and  mandates  (creation  or  evolution) equivalent to that of open-ended funds.\n\n## Training for Institutional and Corporate Clients\n\nAmundi  offers  an  increasing  number  of  training  and knowledge  transfer opportunities  for  its  institutional  and corporate clients.\n\nKnowledge is disseminated to all employees, from newcomers to senior executives and managers for strategic decision-making support through Executive Programs .\n\nIn  2023,  Amundi developed digital training courses focused on  risk  management  in  the  era  of  global  transformation (technological, demographic and geopolitical changes).

It aims to  guide  them  on  a  daily  basis  in  their  actions,  decisions  and conduct,  in  full  compliance  with  the  law,  ethical  rules  and Amundi's  values.  This  Code  of  Conduct  puts  into  practice  the commitments  of  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  S.A.  group's  Ethics  Charter defined  in  2017,  as  the  result  of  a  collaborative  approach between its various business lines.\n\nUpdated regularly, it is shared with all stakeholders (employees, suppliers,  clients,  investors,  etc.).  It  is  available  to  the  public  on the Amundi website. It applies to all members of the company in France  and  abroad.  Consisting  of  seven  chapters  presented  in four  sections:  \"relations  with  clients  and  suppliers,\"  \"social, environmental  and  societal,\"  \"fight  against  corruption\"  and \"protection and reputation of the Group,\" this code specifies the behaviours to adopt, but also those to avoid.

These  aim  to  support  employees, with special monitoring for those who change business line, and to enhance all the company's business lines. Management Committees comprised of the HR managers of each business line regularly review the positions that need to be  filled  and  the  transfer  requests,  thereby  promoting  the coordination  of  supply  and  demand. Via the  MyJobs  site, employees have access to job vacancies available in France and abroad. A guide to internal mobility is also available to them.\n\n## 3.4.2.3 Training\n\nAs a tool, professional training helps to drive the company's development.  Amundi  implements  a  set  of  actions  whose objectives aim to satisfy its strategic ambitions:\n\n- \u00b7 maintain a high level of performance for each position by ensuring  a  match  between  the  activities,  responsibilities and skill level of each employee;\n- \u00b7 develop employability in accordance with individual career plans and company requirements.\n\nThe skills  development plan is drafted annually. It  responds to individual and collective needs, in line with the company's structuring  projects  and  both  regulatory  and  technical developments within the business lines.\n\nJob mobility enhances employee development and commitment. Each employee is followed up individually and appropriate  training  is  provided  at  their  request  or  that  of their manager. Similarly, employees returning from long-term leave  are  trained,  without  prior  arbitration  and  over  the course of the year as soon as the need is reported.\n\nAmundi  has  implemented  a  set  of  training  and  workshops based on the principles of  Amundi  Management Spirit .  This reference framework asserts our management convictions, in line with Amundi's four values, the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole SA human project,  and  our  social  and  societal  commitments.  This framework aims to help managers reflect on their managerial practices.  It  also  encourages  sharing  between  peers  as  well as  within  teams,  to  jointly  arrive  at  solutions  adapted  to problems,  as  close  as  possible  to  individual  needs.  It  is  a matter  of  developing  a  \"mindset\",  rather  than  imposing systematic solutions or training schemes.\n\nIn terms  of  individual  support,  in  addition  to  career management interviews, in 2023, Amundi organised various \"international  days\".  On  this  occasion,  Amundi  employees can  meet  the  managers  of  the  business  lines  that  are recruiting and discuss their career paths.\n\nTo develop international mobility and improve the management  of  the  Group's  different  employment  areas,  a monthly  International  Mobility  Committee  brings  together human resources managers from different countries every 15 days to examine the offers open to international mobility and discuss  the  profiles  of  employees  who  have  expressed  the desire for experience abroad.\n\nManagers are also at the heart of facilitating  internal  mobility, particularly  during  the  annual  professional  interview,  part  of which  is  devoted  to  dialogue  and  gathering  expressions  of interest in geographic and professional mobility.\n\nIts roll-out was communicated to all managers and countries. Amundi  Management  Spirit is based  on  eight  pillars: feedback, evaluation, a 360\u00b0 vision, training, the specific role of managers  of  managers,  coaching, co-development between  peers  and  co-construction  within  teams.  These actions  all  aim  to  develop  the  skills  of  individual  managers, rather than selecting or assessing.\n\nAmundi Management Spirit has been rolled out into training actions for the entire managerial line. New courses have been designed  and  implemented  to  support  new  operational managers and managers of managers. These courses cover the  fundamental  themes  of  management,  in  short  modules that  encourage  discussion  between  peers.  This  offer  is enhanced by individual and collective support solutions (360, development assessment , classic or digital coaching , feedback workshops, co-development cycles).\n\nIt  should  also  be  noted  that  a  mandatory  objective  on  the quality  of  team  management was included for managers of managers  and  front-line  managers  in  the  annual  interview campaign (responsibility interview).\n\nThe training offer on the topic of Responsible Investment was strengthened in 2023 as part of the \"Responsible Investment Training  Journeys\".  Several  digital  training  courses  were carried  out  and  deployed  in  2023  (responsible  investment, Climate  Focus).  These  training  courses  are  aimed  at  all Amundi employees and require a common base in the form of  e-learning.  This  course  includes  the  fundamentals  of responsible investment along with Amundi's convictions and ambitions for Responsible Investment by 2025. Certain areas of  expertise  (management,  middle  office,  risks,  etc.)  will benefit  from  a  specific  offer,  which  may  include  ESG certification, to guarantee a high level of skills in responsible investment,  both  in  their  professional  practice  and  with clients.",

        "page_content": "## 3.4.2.4 Talent Management\n\nEach employee has a dedicated HR manager and individual career  management  to  support  their  development  and growth.  Working  together  with  management,  individual management teams also contribute to tailoring resources to the company's requirements. Organisation of this management  is  aligned  with  the  management  structure. As  such,  it  takes  into  account  the  matrix  dimension  of  the company's  organisation  and  first  comes  into  play  at  local level, pertaining  to  the  direct  hierarchy,  before  being organised  by  business  lines,  with  specific  contacts  for  each one and a cross-functional approach.\n\nHuman  Resource  Managers  (HRMs)  play  a  role  at  several levels:\n\n- \u00b7 employee  reviews  between  HR  business  partner  and management covering all scopes;\n\n## 3.4.2.5 Compensation\n\nAmundi's compensation  policy reflects individual and collective  performance.  It  takes  into  account  the  economic environment, competitiveness and the labour market, factors that  may  vary  from  one  country  to  another.  It  also incorporates the ESG and Climate strategy (as described in 3.2.1.3).  It  is  also  tailored  to  local  situations  and  regulations. The  compensation  policy  is  reviewed  annually  by  the Compensation  Committee  chaired  by  an  independent director and  composed  of  directors  that  are  either independent or who do not hold an executive function within Amundi.  It  complies  with  regulatory  standards  (AIFMD/ UCITS V, MIFID, CRDV, SFDR, and IFR/IFD).\n\nThe key components of Amundi's compensation scheme are as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 a  fixed  salary ,  linked  to  assignments  and  responsibilities, taking into account local specificities and market conditions;\n- \u00b7 variable compensation , which breacks down into an annual bonus  awarded  at  the  manager's  discretion,  and  a Long Term Incentive:\n- \u00b7 the annual bonus rewards an employee's contribution to Amundi's performance and is based on both individual and collective factors,\n- \u00b7 the Long Term Incentive \"LTI\"  is  allocated  to  a  chosen population  of  key  executives,  in  the  form  of  Amundi performance  shares.  It  aims  to  motivate  managers  to achieve multi-year commercial and financial objectives, as well as to implement the ESG pathway. Pursuant to the authorisation granted by the General Shareholders' Meeting  on  10  May  2021,  Amundi's  Board  of  Directors resolved on 27 April 2023 to grant performance shares to certain beneficiaries under the 2023 Plan;\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u00b7 drafting succession plans for key positions;\n- \u00b7 support  for  professional  re-training,  as  well  as  open  and varied career paths within and between business lines;\n- \u00b7 support for employees in difficult circumstances.\n\nExchanges between HR and management are an opportunity to  identify  employees  with  high  potential  for  development within the business. Talent management evolved significantly in  2023  with  the  launch  of  a  new  talent  identification  and support system called \"Amundi Tomorrow\". This system has two  main  objectives:  to  identify  talent  across  all  countries through  three  groups:  Early  Years,  Novamundi  and  Future leaders; and develop the succession plans of the management  committees  in  the  countries  and  divisions  in order  to  prepare  the  management  teams  of  tomorrow, integrating the issues of diversity and leadership support.\n\n- \u00b7 collective variable compensation which associates employees in France with Amundi's financial performance. Its total amount is set as a function of a benchmark figure adjusted  for  changes  in  net  income,  in  assets  under management, and in the cost-to-income ratio. In 2023, the average  amount  of  collective  variable  compensation  was more than \u20ac10,000, in connection with Amundi's results for 2022;\n- \u00b7 social benefits, which offer protection to the employee and his/her  family  ( health  and  pension )  and  support  the employee in preparing for retirement.\n\nIn  2023,  Amundi's  priorities  in  the  implementation  of  the compensation policy were as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 to protect purchasing power while continuing to value the professional development of employees:\n- \u00b7 the protection of purchasing power against the context of  inflation  resulted,  in  France,  in  two  value-sharing bonuses,  one  in  the  amount  of  \u20ac800  paid  in  March  to employees whose fixed compensation was less than or equal  to  \u20ac90,000,  the  other  in  the  amount  of  \u20ac1,000 paid in July to employees meeting the same condition. These  two  measures  follow  the  collective  increase  of July 2022 which represented 2% of the payroll,\n- \u00b7 support for the professional development of employees resulted  in  a  significant  boost  in  increase  budgets:  the budget  devoted  to  individual  increases  represented 2.8% of the payroll;\n- \u00b7 to ensure equal pay between women and men: to this end, since  2018,  specific  annual  envelopes  have  been  used  to correct  unjustified  pay  gaps  between  women  and  men. Thus, as in 2022, a budget was provided in 2023 to close any gaps in variable compensation. This measure comes in addition to the non-proratisation of bonuses for women on maternity leave, implemented since 2020.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The  employee  health prevention  policy  is  based  on  a  continuous  improvement approach,  integrated  into  the  policies  of  the  Human Resources  Department  and  marked  by  a  multidisciplinary approach  (Managers,  Human  Resources,  Prevention  and Occupational  Health  Service,  social  worker,  harassment contacts,  employee-representative  bodies (1) ).  This  gives  rise to extensive social dialogue with employee representatives.\n\nNumerous  agreements  set  out  the  commitments  made  by Amundi on these issues:\n\n- \u00b7 the 2018 agreement on the exercise of trade union rights lays the foundation for social dialogue in the company;\n\n## 3.4.3.1 Psychosocial risk prevention:\n\nFor Amundi, in France, psychosocial risk(PSR)  prevention is the  subject  of  specific  corporate  governance.  It  is  led  by  a Watchdog Committee which meets quarterly. Its purpose is to  detect  collective  situations  that  may  cause  psychosocial risk, in particular through  the  analysis  of  monitoring indicators, and identifies collective prevention actions to be implemented. A monthly Management Committee is dedicated to the monitoring by the Human Resources (HR) department  of  sensitive  individual  situations.  At  the  same time,  all  HR  stakeholders  and  the  Occupational  Health  and Prevention Department are on hand to provide personalised support  to  employees  who  are  experiencing  difficulties  (all dialogue remains confidential).\n\nIn 2023, Amundi:\n\n- \u00b7 continued its psychosocial risk prevention actions already in  place:  listening  space,  monitoring  of  long  absences  in coordination with the Occupational Health and Prevention Department, training of managers and employees on stress prevention and management, Responsage platform (information and advice service for family caregivers) and extension of working from home for care-giving employees, working from home support system intended for  managers  and  employees  (self-diagnostics,  virtual classes  on  remote  management,  hybrid  team  charter, co -development  cycles,  coaching  for  managers,  working from home guide, webinars and conferences);\n- \u00b7 strengthened  its  response  to  the  potential  consequences of new hybrid modes of work: isolation, loss of community, work overload/underload, hyperconnection/ disconnection,  work/life  balance,  stress,  etc.  Indeed,  the\n\n- \u00b7 the new international framework agreement applicable to all  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole subsidiaries signed on 9 October 2023 with  UNI  Global  (World  Confederation  of  Trade  Unions) includes  specific  measures  in  terms  of  health,  safety  and quality of life at work;\n- \u00b7 the  agreement  on  quality  of  life  and  working  conditions ensures,  among  other  things,  the  balance  between  work and personal  life  (working  from  home,  parenting,  helping employees, social services, etc.);\n- \u00b7 the  working  from  home  agreement  in  2021  (commuting, the  right  to  disconnect  after  hours,  digital  tools)  and  the Disability  agreement,  re-signed  in  2022,  (one  of  the components  of  which  concerns  the  adaptation  of workstations) round off the reference frameworks.\n\nexperience  of  the  sanitary  crisis  and  the  emergence  of hybrid  work  have  demonstrated  the  need  to  ensure  a framework  and  monitoring  in  terms  of  disconnection,  in order  to  preserve  the  work/life  balance.  This  principle  is enshrined  in  the  first  agreement  on  quality  of  life  and working conditions signed on 8 February 2022 (guarantee of a right to disconnect outside working hours, reminder of the importance of taking leave in particular);\n\n- \u00b7 initiated  an  approach  aimed  at  strengthening  its  system and processes in terms of prevention of psychosocial risks: formalisation  of  a  global  prevention  policy,  strengthening the monitoring of risk situations, formalisation of the alert processing  process,  training  of  those  involved  in  the prevention of psychosocial risks, implementation  of awareness-raising  actions,  overhaul  and  updating  of  the single professional risk assessment document (referred to by its French acronym as DUERP).\n\nInternationally, the  entities are also committed  to  the prevention  of  psychosocial  risks  by  offering  managerial training  and  carrying  out  specific  actions.  For  example,  in Ireland,  the  focus  is  on  the  mental  and  physical  health  of employees. To do this, a contribution is paid to all employees for costs related to health and well-being, such as exercise and fitness  classes,  club  membership,  sports  equipment.  A  Wellbeing at Work Week is organised with individual consultations with a nutritionist, physiotherapist or health coach. Amundi US offers,  in  partnership  with  a  health  insurance  company,  an online  mental  health  service  (\"Learn  to  Live\")  as  well  as  an Employee  Assistance  Program  (EAP).  In  Germany,  training was carried out on the topics of work/life balance and stress management.",

        "page_content": "## 3.4.3.2 Health policy\n\nIn  2023,  preventive  actions  in  the  area  of  physical  health were still an essential part of Amundi's health policy, both in France and internationally.\n\nIn France:\n\n- \u00b7 In  January,  a  COVID  vaccination  booster  campaign  was offered to all employees and benefited around 250 people.\n- \u00b7 Throughout the year, first aid training sessions have been scheduled, whether in a reduced format of 2 hours, as an introduction  to  lifesaving  actions  or  in  a  more  complete format  of  2  days  to  become  an  International  Workplace Rescuer). This concerns about 150 people.\n- \u00b7 In  October,  the  seasonal  flu  vaccination  campaign  and COVID booster  allowed  more  than  550  employees  to  be vaccinated  without  having  to  go  to  a  doctor  or  a pharmacy.\n- \u00b7 In  November,  the  Prevention  and  Occupational  Health Department  launched  an  Annual  Health  Course  entitled: \"Let's  learn  how  to  take  care  of  our  health\"  which  will extend until July 2024. During this course, employees have the opportunity to register for face-to-face workshops on 3 main topics: physical health, mental health and emotional health.  This  Health  Course  is  in  line  with  the  Ergonomics Course offered in 2022 and the Quality of Life and Working Conditions  weeks  and  aims  to  meet  the  needs  of employees in terms of physical and mental health.\n\n## 3.4.3.3 Quality of life in the workplace (QLW)\n\nConvinced  that  sustainable  performance  must  strike  a  balance between  the  search  for  efficiency  and  the  well-being  of employees, Amundi has implemented measures to improve the quality of life at work and to promote a better work-life balance of its employees.\n\n- In France,  the  agreement  on  quality  of  life  and  working conditions signed in 2022 continued to be implemented. Its main pillars are:\n- \u00b7 support for new ways of organising work, in particular through training;\n- \u00b7 redesigned,  modern,  responsible  and  supportive  workspaces. As part of the \"Happy at work\" project, initiated in early 2023 and aimed at improving on-site working conditions in terms of quality of facilities and dining, Amundi is currently testing the establishment  of  three  relaxation  areas/coffee  break/lunch break outside the usual dining areas. A food truck service has also been rolled out since 2023 to diversify the dining offer;\n- \u00b7 a better work/life balance, including by strengthening the right to  disconnect  after  working  hours  in  the  context  of  working from  home;  as  such,  the  possibility  of  adding  a  specific mention in the email signature relating to disconnecting after working hours was studied in 2023 and is being implemented;\n- \u00b7 the continuation of actions for the health of employees and the strengthening  of  monitoring  and  prevention  systems  for mental and physical health resulted in 2023  in the programming  of  a  discovery  course  in  physical,  mental  and emotional  health  called  \"Let's  learn  how  to  take  care  of  our health\"  and  by  setting  up  an  HR  working  group  on strengthening the prevention of psychosocial risks;\n- \u00b7 solidarity schemes (donation of days' leave between colleagues for those facing critical human situations).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u00b7 In December, a webinar on understanding and preventing addiction and how to get support to overcome them took place with the President of SOS Addictions France. A day of skin cancer screening conducted by a dermatologist in person continued Amundi's commitment to preventing and combating cancer.\n\nInternationally, the  entities  are  also  developing  health initiatives.  In  Japan,  in  the  event  of  sickness,  measures  are planned  to  adjust  working  time  with  sick  leave  of  6  days granted  beyond  the  statutory  leave,  the  possibility  of working  from  home  and  increased  flexibility  with,  in particular,  organising  work  hours  in  shifts.  In  Germany, special  attention  is  paid  to  vision  problems,  with  each employee  benefiting  from  eye  tests  and  receiving  a  \u20ac150 grant  for  their  eyeglasses.  In  Italy,  three  coaching  sessions are  offered  to  employees  returning  from  long  sick  leave  to support their return to work. In 2023, Amundi US developed a  comprehensive  programme aimed at the mental, physical and  well-being  of  employees.  These  programmes  include reimbursement of the costs of massage, hypnosis, meditation,  tai  chi  and  the  free  provision  of  an  application that  offers  guided  meditations,  courses  to  improve  sleep, fight  against  anxiety  and  stress.  Contributions  are  also granted  to  support  weight  loss  (reimbursement  of  health club subscriptions, online fitness subscriptions, fitness classes, cardio and weightlifting equipment).\n\nAmundi goes beyond what is required by legislation in a number of areas by acting on:\n\n- \u00b7 the  organisation  of  work:  meetings  that  comply  with  the team's working hours, defined planning ahead of time, periods when accessible in the context of remote working etc.;\n- \u00b7 measures  for  parents:  contractual  maternity  leave,  sick  child days,  maintenance  of  salary  as  part  of  paternity  leave, maternity and parenting guides, etc.;\n- \u00b7 improvement  of  the  working  conditions  of  seniors,  with  the adjustment  of  the  transition  between  activity  and  retirement (assisted part-time, personalised assessment, retirement preparation  training,  end-of-career  leave,  transition  leave financed by the Time Savings Account, days freed up as part of a societal and environmental commitment, etc.);\n- \u00b7 services  for  employees  to  simplify  their  daily  lives:  company concierge,  gym,  food  take-away  service  in  addition  to  the company restaurant;\n- \u00b7 systems  dedicated  to  caregiving  staff:  practical  guide, the Responsage platform (information and advice service), donations of days' leave, extension of teleworking;\n- \u00b7 supporting the social endeavours of the Works Council: access to  childcare  centres,  help  with  childcare  costs,  universal service employment vouchers.\n\nFollowing on from the signing of the QVCT (Quality of Life and Working  Conditions)  agreement,  Amundi  organised  its  second QVCT Week in June 2023 on its Paris and Valence (in France) sites on the theme \"disconnect, reconnect, balance,\" as well as a cycle  of  conferences  which  addressed  various  topics  such  as neuroatypism, intergenerational issues and even addictions.\n\nIn  addition,  since  February  2023,  Amundi has increased the reimbursement of cost of public transport to 90% and has set up the sustainable mobility package.\n\n<!-- image -->",

On  a  case-by-case basis,  some  entities  also  offer  more  flexible  working  time arrangements  that  take  account  of  individual  situations,  for example  in  the  United  States  and  Ireland.  Some  countries, such  as  Spain  and  Italy,  provide  an  allowance  that  covers part of the costs of teleworking (ergonomic chairs, screens, WiFi, energy etc.).\n\nIn  Great  Britain,  a  monthly  committee  to  monitor  and improve  the  working  environment  is  organised  with  the\n\ninvolvement  of  the  occupational  physician;  its  work  may  in some  cases  lead  to  the  organisation  of  programmes, seminars or events focused on the health and well-being of employees.\n\nIn Italy, in addition to the \"smart-working\" agreement signed in early 2022, providing for two days a week of working from home,  in  2023,  self-service  bicycles  are  offered  to  all employees at the office.\n\nIn  Germany,  in  addition  to  the  possibility  of  working  from home two days a week, each employee can take up to  six days a year to reconcile work and private life. In the United States, work-life balance also includes service proposals that include pet care.\n\n## 3.4.4 Compliance with the principles of equality, diversity and inclusion\n\nAmundi  believes  that  the  diversity  of  all  its  employees,  their integration and the promotion of all talents are essential to help spearhead its development. Respect for the equal opportunities principle is the driving force behind its HR policy.\n\nAmundi considers that all forms of discriminatory behaviour are unacceptable,  depriving  people  of  the  respect  they  are  due and harming their  well-being  at  work.  To  combat  stereotypes and overcome the cognitive bias that fuels prejudice, Amundi raises awareness  of  non-discrimination  issues  among  its executives, managers and employees.\n\nPromoting  equal  opportunities  for  all,  regardless  of  age, nationality,  ethnic  origin,  gender,  sexual  orientation,  socioeconomic background or disability, is not just a matter of legal or  ethical  compliance.  Encouraging  internal  cohesion  and  a sense of belonging is also a factor of performance.\n\nThe equality, diversity and inclusion policy applies to all Amundi employees. It complies with the national laws and regulations in force,  which  explains  why  it  can  be  adapted  locally,  as  is  the case in the United States, the United Kingdom and Austria.\n\nIt encompasses:\n\n- \u00b7 promoting an inclusive culture and raising awareness among all  employees  by  combating  sub-conscious  prejudices  and stereotypes, collecting and disseminating good practice and asking for managers' help in disseminating this culture;\n- \u00b7 equity in key HR processes: recruitment, compensation, and merit-based career promotion and review;\n- \u00b7 the development of global programmes to speed up priority Inclusion  and  Diversity  issues  and  at  the  same  time,  the provision  of  support  for  local  initiatives  to  better  take geographical specificities into account.\n\nAmundi's non-discrimination and diversity policy is based on the main principles laid down in French and international texts, of which the Group has long been a signatory, such as:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAmundi's  Equality,  Diversity  and  Inclusion  policy  aims  to eliminate all types of discrimination and focuses in particular on  four  themes  that  are  the  subject  of  dedicated  action plans:  gender  equality,  parenting,  age  and  intergenerational connections  as  well  as  the  inclusion  of  people  with disabilities.\n\nIn  2023,  Amundi  strengthened  its  equality,  diversity  and inclusion policy while maintaining its long-standing commitments, in particular by:\n\n- \u00b7 defining  an  action  plan  to  support  the  increase  in  the percentage of women among investment professionals;\n- \u00b7 the gradual international extension of paternity/coparenting leave of 28 paid calendar days;\n- \u00b7 the development and deployment of a new action plan for people  with  disabilities,  in  line  with  the  7 th Group Agreement signed in 2022;\n- \u00b7 the establishment by the Human Resources Department of a  dedicated  Equality,  Diversity  and  Inclusion  Steering Committee  including  representatives  from  Great  Britain, Ireland,  Japan,  Italy  and  Luxembourg.  This  committee promotes  the  sharing  of  best  practices  and  transversal themes  to  be  deepened.  In  2023,  initial  work  was undertaken on intergenerational issues;",

In  France,  Amundi  has been  particularly  involved  in  the  work  initiated  on  the theme  of diversity by the French Association of Investment Management (AFG) which brings together the actors  of  asset  management.  The  company  is  also  a partner of the Club Landois whose goal is to come up with innovative solutions to demographic change.\n\n## 3.4.4.1 Gender equality in the workplace\n\nAmundi's Board of Directors has set a target for the number of  women  across  all  management  bodies,  to  ensure  a balanced gender representation in the company's governing bodies:\n\n- \u00b7 a  target  of  30%  women  in  its  Executive  Committee  by 2022. This figure was actually exceeded. It stood at 38.1% at the end of December 2023;\n- \u00b7 a target of 35% in 2025 for the Senior Leadership Team (1) . This rate stood at 33% at the end of December 2023.\n\nIn so doing, Amundi is on track to comply with Article 14 of the  French  \"Rixain\"  law  which  sets  out  the  obligation  of balanced  gender  representation  among  senior  executives and  members  of  the  management  bodies  of  companies, accompanied  by  an  obligation  of  transparency.  The  target is 30% from 1 March 2026 and 40% as of 1 March 2029.\n\nThe  action  plan  dedicated  to  professional  equality  for  all employees is based on two major axes\n\n## 1 st axis: Monitoring differences in pay between men and women in order to detect, prevent, reduce and compensate for unjustified differences in pay.\n\nAmundi  set  up  a  gender  equality  index  in  2019,  which  has made regular progress since that date. In 2023, it settled at 86 out of a maximum of 100 points, based on the following indicators:  equality  of  rates  of  individual  wage  increases (excluding promotions), promotion rate, proportion of female employees  whose  wages  were  increased  after  returning from maternity leave.\n\nTo help reduce or prevent unjustified discrepancies, Amundi has implemented several initiatives in recent years:\n\n- \u00b7 specific  financial  packages  intended  to  reduce  unfair  pay gaps. In 2022 and 2023, an envelope specifically targeted differences in individual variable compensation;\n- \u00b7 the  guarantee  given  to  female  employees  returning  from maternity leave that they will receive a pay increase equal to at least the average increase granted during the period of leave, as part of the annual compensation campaign. All female  employees  returning  from  maternity  leave  benefit from this measure;\n- \u00b7 the  non-prorating  of  women's  bonuses  for  the  period corresponding  to  statutory  and  conventional  maternity leave.\n\n## Amundi's commitments\n\n- Internationally,  in  Great  Britain  or  Ireland,  entities  engage in  initiatives  such  as  Women  in  Finance.  Amundi  US  is  a partner  of  the  \"Fort\u00e9  Foundation\"  dedicated  to  the advancement of women;\n- \u00b7 a  video  collected  under  the  banner  \"Amundi  for  All,\"  the word  as  well  as  the  commitments  in  terms  of  diversity, carried by the HR Director World, France and international entities.\n\n## 2 nd axis: Supporting women towards positions of responsibility.\n\nIn  order  to  support  women  in  taking  responsibility  with  a view  to  ensuring  a  balanced  representation  within  the company and to removing obstacles to their careers, Amundi acts on four essential drivers:\n\n- \u00b7 awareness-raising  and  training.  Each  year,  leadership training  programmes  are  offered  to  female  talent  to enhance their access to positions of responsibility. In 2023, twelve  women  were  supported  during  these  various programmes, whether in Europe or Asia. In addition, twelve other  women  benefited  from  the  specific  mentoring programme proposed to feminize the investment management professions;\n- \u00b7 taking the objectives of female representation into account throughout the HR process. Women now make up 43% of talent  pools.  In  succession  plans  for  key  positions,  the percentage of women has increased to 48%. A global action plan has been launched to develop the presence of women in investment  management  professions.  This  plan  addresses four major issues: attractiveness and recruitment, development  and  retention,  compensation  and  corporate culture. It is being implemented with the provision of tools for managers, the implementation of mentoring programmes put in  place  by  senior  managers,  the  systematisation  of  career path  interviews,  and  the  review  of  succession  plans  and compensation;\n- \u00b7 communication  and  promotion  of  first-rate  career  paths. Throughout  the  year,  and  around  the  world,  Amundi contributes  to  numerous  events  and  increases  initiatives aimed at raising public awareness of the importance of a more balanced representation in the workplace and, more particularly, in finance:\n- \u00b7 a  Gender  Equality  Network,  Amundi  Women's  Network (AWN),  has  more  than  570  members  in  France,  and  its international  activities  continued  to  be  rolled  out  in  2023  in Ireland, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, the United States and Japan.  On  the  occasion  of  International  Women's  Day,  the AWN network organised an international conference whose guest  of  honour  was  Val\u00e9rie  Hoffenberg,  co-founder  of  the think tank \"Marie-Claire, agir pour l'\u00e9galit\u00e9. [\"Marie-Claire, act for equality\"] Another example, the gender quality network in the  United  States,  the  \"Women  &  Allies  Group\"  carries  out awareness-raising actions on the theme of gender equity and intersectionality which makes it possible to better think and act  on  inequalities.  In  Ireland,  a  partnership  was  set  up between Amundi Women's Network Ireland and the National College  of  Ireland  \"100  Women  in  Finance\",  which  enabled welcoming a hundred students from University College Dublin during the month of diversity;\n- \u00b7 International  Women's  Rights  Day  is  an  opportunity  to  lead initiatives  in  many  countries:  such  as,  for  example,  Women's Stories  and  celebration  of  Women's  History  Month  in  the United States and the Americas.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

In 2023, we can  highlight  the  promotion  of  investment  professions  to  a female audience in connection with the University of Bocconi in Italy, the Women in Finance Charter in Great Britain or Ireland. A partnership continued with the Women & Science Chair at Paris Dauphine University. It analyses the determinants and impact of the low percentages of women in scientific studies and careers. Amundi  adheres  to  charters  and  initiatives  that  promote diversity:\n\n- \u00b7 in July 2022, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. group signed the \"Women's empowerment  principles,\"  created  under  the  aegis  of  the United Nations to advance gender equality and the empowerment of women in the workplace;\n\n## 3.4.4.2 Parenting\n\nAs part of its equality, diversity and inclusion policy, Amundi affirms that career development is compatible with parenthood, in particular through:\n\n- \u00b7 measures in favour of maternity with:\n- \u00b7 a 16-week maternity leave allowing every woman since 2020,  in  all  Amundi  locations,  to  combine  their  career with motherhood,\n- \u00b7 non-prorating  of  the  bonus during  maternity  leave which has also been implemented since 2020,\n- \u00b7 the expansion of working from home opportunities for pregnant women;\n- \u00b7 measures in favour of paternity/co-parenting with:\n- \u00b7 in France, since July 2022, a paid paternity leave of 28 calendar  days  to  include  men,  equally  concerned  by parenthood and the work/life balance,\n- \u00b7 internationally, from  2023,  the  extension  of  this paternity/co-parenting leave of 28 paid calendar days in eight  entities:  Italy,  USA,  Luxembourg,  Switzerland, Spain, Poland, Germany and Japan.\n\n## 3.4.4.3 Youth, Seniors and intergenerational ties\n\nAmundi  continues  to  strengthen  the  connection  and synergies  between  generations  at  work,  for  the  mutual benefit of young people and all the company's employees.\n\nWith  this  in  mind,  Amundi  contributes  to  the  professional integration of young people, providing a host of initiatives to give them work experience or initial immersion:\n\n- \u00b7 internships  and  work-study  programmes  allow  them  to gain  a  first  experience,  while  benefiting  from  funding  for their studies. Since the beginning of the year 2023, Amundi has welcomed and trained more than 1,300 young people, including  720  trainees,  370  work-study  students  and  104 apprenticeships;\n- \u00b7 the \" Engagement Jeunes \" (Youth Engagement platform to which  the  company  has  adhered  since  2021)  makes students more visible at the end of their journey at Amundi and  promotes  their  access  to  employment  (mentors  can recommend  the  students  they  have  welcomed  and  this information is shared with other member companies);\n\n- \u00b7 in  the  United  Kingdom,  Amundi  is  committed  to  gender balance in positions of responsibility by respecting the Women in Finance Charter;\n- \u00b7 Amundi Italy mobilised in 2023 to obtain gender equality certification  issued  by  Bureau  Veritas,  an  independent certification  body,  recognised  by  the  Italian  ministry  of equal opportunities;\n- \u00b7 Amundi  has  also  been  involved  with  the  \"30%  Club  France Investor  Group\"  since  November  2020,  alongside  six  French asset  management  companies,  in  order  to  promote  better gender  diversity  within  the  management  bodies  of  the SBF 120. This club calls  on  French  large  caps  to  draw  up  an action  plan  so  that  their  governing  bodies  comprise  at  least 30% women by 2025.\n- \u00b7 taking into account specific parenting situations with:\n- \u00b7 the  continuation  of  the  disability  bonus  of  \u20ac1,200  for employees with a spouse or a child with a disability,\n- \u00b7 additional  leave  of  3  days  per  year  in  the  event  of  a hospitalised child and donation of days in the event of a serious illness,\n- \u00b7 a  work  started  in  2023  aimed  at  better  taking  into account  single  parenthood  and  its  issues  within  the company,  resulting  in  the  signing  of  a  professional equality  agreement  committing  to  raising  awareness and  supporting  employees  in  a  situation  of  single parenthood.\n\nInternationally, the entities are also committed to parenting: in  the United States, establishment of a childcare system to support parents in need of assistance (working from home, care,  unforeseen absence from school...) - \"summer camps\" offered in Germany - Babysitting coupons in Japan. Several entities  also  offer  support  in  person  or via webinars  for employees  returning  from  leave  related  to  parenting,  in  an effort to promote a smooth return to work and to guarantee a work/life balance. For instance, Ireland offers three annual sessions  to  organise  this  return  in  the  best  possible conditions.\n\n- \u00b7 the recruitment and integration program Odyss\u00e9e targets young  graduates  in  search  of  a  permanent  employment contract  in  order  to  integrate  into  the  company  new profiles with potential for development and to support the development of Amundi, especially internationally (Asia);\n- \u00b7 the signing of the PAQTE, as part of an Amundi-Moza\u00efk HR partnership,  makes  it  possible  to  work  to  create  jobs  for young people from the Priority Neighbourhoods of Urban Policy.  In  addition,  as  part  of  its  work-study  campaign, Amundi  is  committed  to  integrating  young  people  with disabilities,  thus  increasing  to  17%  the  number  of  workstudy students with disabilities or from priority neighbourhoods of urban policy;\n- \u00b7 the company is also mobilised through actions included in the Youth Plan led by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. group. This is a comprehensive, collective approach  to support the integration and employment of young people.",

        "page_content": "The year 2023 was also marked by numerous meetings and actions carried out with young people, including:\n\n- \u00b7 four  school  partnerships  led  by  Amundi  employees: Dauphine, EDHEC, ESSEC, Centrale Sup\u00e9lec;\n- \u00b7 participation  in  16  forums  and  school  events  throughout the year 2023: Legal careers forum, ENSIMAG forum, Trium forum...;\n- \u00b7 three meetings with the universities of Dauphine, Bocconi, and Dresden within our premises which made it possible to welcome students within a framework more conducive to exchanges and the presentation of professions;\n- \u00b7 participation in the MobiliJeunes, a support and preparation scheme for career management, organised by Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  S.A.  group,  for  trainees  and  work-study participants at the end of their assignment: CV advice and motivation letters, training in interview skills.\n\nIn  addition,  the  \"Give  a  Hand\"  programme  was  launched  in 2023 (explained in 3.4.6.2) to young apprentices engaged in solidarity  initiatives.  Two  projects  submitted  by  apprentices were  selected  to  receive  financial  assistance  through  this scheme.\n\nFor  the  10 th consecutive  year,  Amundi  has  obtained  the Happy Trainees label, rewarding the company for the quality of its reception and support of young people, with:\n\n- \u00b7 a recommendation rate of 90%;\n- \u00b7 87% of students who say they have opportunities to learn and develop new skills;\n- \u00b7 90%  of  students  who  report  that  their  work  is  well organised and respects their work/life balance.\n\nInternationally,  the  entities  are  also  active  in  youth  policy: reception  of  trainees  and  apprenticeships,  interventions  in schools  (such  as  in  Taiwan  and  Hong  Kong),  partnerships with  associations  in  favour  of  minorities  (United  States)  or promoting finance professions among students, as is the case in Great Britain or Ireland.\n\nAs part of its career and talent management policy, Amundi also  encourages  the  development  of  intergenerational  links between  young  people  gaining  their  first  work  experience and  seniors  ready  to  share  their  skills.  Based  on  voluntary work,  this  cooperative  work  between  the  generations strengthens team spirit, one of the company's values.\n\nIn  this  way,  Amundi  wishes  to  help  young  people  integrate by  inviting experienced  employees  to  pass  on  their knowledge  and  explain  the  company's  codes  to  ease  their immersion in its  culture.  It  is  also  a  way  of  highlighting  the experience of seniors. These opportunities for discussion and openness are a source of mutual enrichment.\n\nIn order to strengthen intergenerational cooperation, Amundi has  also  renewed  its  partnership  with  the  T\u00e9l\u00e9maque association  for  the  mentoring  of  young  middle  and  high\n\n## Amundi's commitments\n\nschool  students,  in  which  20  volunteer  employees  are involved.  In  addition,  each  young  trainee  who  joins  the company is offered mentoring. In 2023, Amundi reviewed its system  for  welcoming  trainees  in  the  company,  a  full  day having  been  devoted  to  them  in  addition  to  the  usual practices.\n\nInternationally, individual coaching programs (United States), mentoring (in Ireland or the United States, with the launch of a  new  \"Amundi  connect\"  programme)  or  aimed  at  putting together mixed teams (Czech Republic) have been launched in several entities.\n\nIn  2023,  Amundi  launched  work  on  intergenerational  issues to analyse demographic dynamics in the different regions of the  world,  in  a  dual  context  of  issues  of  retaining  young talent and increases in years worked.\n\nIn intergenerational matters, Amundi's policy is underpinned by an essential principle: to support its employees throughout their professional career, from their hiring to their departure from the company, in a logic of long-term careers.\n\nFor seniors, the company offers them mobility opportunities as well as an upskilling /reskilling programme when relevant and - depending on the specific context of the country - by supporting them during their gradual retirement. This  senior  policy  aims  to  prevent  situations  of  age-related discrimination, while ensuring senior employees have career development  opportunities  consistent  with  that  of  all employees.  As  they  approach  the  end  of  their  careers, schemes are in place to simplify the transition from work to retirement  and  to  facilitate  the  transfer  of  their  skills  and expertise.\n\nAmundi's  policy  in  favour  of  seniors  is  based  on  two  main pillars:\n\n- \u00b7 mechanisms for supporting and adapting positions aimed at job retention with the possibility of organising working time,  skills  assessments,  preventive  health  actions  and health  assessments,  as  well  as  the  possibility  of  evolving into new roles such as senior advisor, interim manager or occasional trainer;\n- \u00b7 end-of-career  schemes  involving  part-time  work,  end-ofcareer leave, a retirement simulation, skills sponsorship or support for caregiving employees.\n\nSeveral  international  entities  are  experiencing  changes  in their local regulations regarding retirement age. For example, in  Japan,  the  retirement  age  has  increased  from  60  to  65 years. Others face challenges related to the \"seniorisation\" of their  employees,  which  leads  them  to  carry  out  specific retirement  preparation  programmes  (Luxembourg),  end-ofcareer  mentoring  (Germany),  specially  arranged  part-time work (Austria, Czech Republic), or succession plans in most entities such as the United States, Germany or Japan.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

It includes commitments to develop long term the employment rate of people  with  disabilities  and  is  part  of  a  continuous improvement approach: job retention, support for employees at  the  end  of  their  career  or  preparation  for  the  end  of approved agreements.\n\nThanks  to  this  proactive  policy,  in  2023  Amundi  has  15 recruits,  all  types  of  contracts  combined  and  has  an increasing  employment  rate  for  the  4 th consecutive  year (3.3%). In 2023, nearly 8% of its students recruited on a workstudy basis were disabled. These results are based namely on partnerships  established  for  many  years  with  recruitment firms or specialised actors such as Moza\u00efk HR, JobInLive and Comp\u00e9thance who combine their knowledge of the disability sector  with  an  approach  focused  on  skills  consistent  with Amundi's business lines.\n\nAmundi therefore had 99 employees with disabilities in 2023. In addition,  aware  that  the  inclusion  of  people  with disabilities  requires  a  customised  approach  to  respond  to specific individual situations, Amundi knows how to count on the commitment of its employees who have welcomed:\n\n- \u00b7 nine  trainees  with  disabilities,  including  2  high  school students  from  the  EREA  (Regional  School  for  Adapted Education)  Jean  Monnet  de  Garches  and  3  high  school students  from  the  French  National  Institute  for  Young Blind People;\n- \u00b7 on the occasion of DuoDay, 18 people with disabilities, to allow  them  to  discover  the  world  of  business  and  the different  possible  professions,  with  a  wide  variety  of profiles:    ten  middle  school  students  from  specialised classrooms,  a  high  school  student  from  the  French National  Institute  for  Young  Blind  People  and  seven  jobseekers.\n\n## 3.4.4.5 Actions for raising awareness\n\nTraining,  awareness,  communication  and  the  fight  against unconscious  bias  and  stereotypes  are  an  integral  part  of Amundi's global action plan to achieve progress on the issues of diversity and non-discrimination.\n\nIn  2023,  in  France,  the  awareness-raising  programme  for employees and managers continued, thanks to a serious game available to all on the Phileas training platform. A \"Combating\n\n## 3.4.4.6 Cultural diversity and diversity in society\n\nWith  a  presence  in  35  countries  and  with  more  than 80  nationalities,  Amundi  nurtures  and  promotes  cultural diversity.\n\nAmundi  firmly  believes  that  the  cultural  wealth  of  its  teams, united  around  a  common  goal,  strategy  and  values  (courage, team  spirit,  entrepreneurship,  solidarity)  is  a  key  factor  in  its success.\n\nWhile  common  principles  guide  Amundi  entities  around  the world, particular attention is paid to consideration of local social and societal realities.\n\nMultiple actions have also been carried out:\n\n- \u00b7 participating in a working group for the implementation of disability  awareness  training  for  all  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  S.A. group employees;\n- \u00b7 the launch of an internal questionnaire, on the occasion of the  European  Week  for  the  Employment  of  People  with Disabilities (SEEPH), to assess the vision and expectations of employees with regard to the disability policy;\n- \u00b7 support  for  the  protected  sector,  through  a  responsible procurement policy (more than \u20ac600,000 per year).\n\nIn  2023,  in  France,  Amundi  participated  in  financing  the renovation  work  for  the  restaurant  \"La  Belle  Etincelle,\" located near Amundi's Paris headquarters, which employs a majority  of  employees  with  disabilities.  In  addition  to  the allocation  of  a  disability  allowance  of  \u20ac1,200  paid  to employees  with  a  spouse  or  child  with  disabilities  (see 3.4.4.2),  Amundi has provided a support measure of \u20ac1,200 for  employees  who  have  disabilities.  This  measure  aims  to offset part of the costs (care, well-being, etc.) incurred due to disability in the private sphere.\n\nA charter has been issued to allow employees who welcome a guide dog for blind students to come accompanied by their dog  to  their  workplace,  for  the  purpose  of  educating  the latter.\n\nMore  generally,  a  portion  of  the  company's  apprenticeship tax  (the  non-quota  portion)  is  also  set  aside  to  support schools  and  charities  working  to  promote  disability  and inclusion in France. Internationally, actions for the inclusion of people with disabilities  are  carried  out,  such  as  recruitment (Japan), financial aid or inclusive partnership, such as in Italy, additional leave in Germany or actions for raising awareness in Ireland.\n\ndiscrimination\"  module  is  integrated  into  the  training  course for  managers  taking  up  a  position  as  well  as  that  of  Human Resources  professionals  required  to  carry  out  recruitments. This  topic  is  also  addressed  in  the  training  provided  to  the mentors  of  students  on  work-study  programmes  at  Amundi. As part of Diversity Month, several events made it possible to raise employees' awareness of the issues of equality, diversity and inclusion.\n\nConsequently, countries can build on the diversity, equality and inclusion policy and are responsible for its local implementation. A global  HR  Management Committee, chaired by the Amundi Group HR Director, bringing together all the HR Directors of the Amundi entities, meets every week to ensure that specific local circumstances  are  taken  into  account  and  to  encourage  the exchange of best practices. In 2023, Amundi launched an action plan  to  internationalise  its  talent  pools  and  set  the  goal  of reaching 50% international profiles and 50% French profiles by 2025.",

        "page_content": "## 3.4.5 Encouraging social dialogue and profit sharing\n\n## 3.4.5.1 Social dialogue policy\n\nAmundi  believes  that  the  quality  of  social  dialogue  and respect for the role and operation of employee representative bodies are factors in cohesive, balanced social relations and  contribute  to  the  development  of  the company.\n\nA  driver  of  economic  efficiency  and  social  progress,  social dialogue  is  one  of  the  pillars  of  its  responsible  employer policy.\n\nThe company respects freedom of association and therefore considers the exercise of trade union rights, staff representation and collective bargaining to be a fundamental right.  Several  commitments  aimed  at  ensuring  the  exercise of  trade  union  rights  have  been  made,  in  particular  in  the agreement on the exercise of the right to organise (2018), the international framework agreement (2019 - renegotiated and signed again in 2023), or the agreement on the constitution of the European Committee (2008).\n\nAll these texts, to which Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. group's Ethical Charter refers, apply to Amundi.\n\nIt  is  in  this  context  that  Amundi  conducts  a  constructive social  dialogue  with  the  various  employee  representatives, whether through formal bodies or through the implementation of ad hoc bodies.\n\nIn  2023,  professional elections were held during which staff representatives  were  elected  to  Amundi's  Economic  and Social Unit (UES) for a term of 4 years. At the end of these elections, training was organised to support elected officials in the exercise of their mandate.\n\nIn order to take into account the inflation context of 2022, it is recalled that Amundi, in consultation with the trade unions, had decided to open the annual salary negotiations early. A major collective  measure  on  the  annual  gross  fixed  compensation (increase of \u20ac1,800 gross of the annual fixed compensation for employees with a fixed annual compensation less than or equal to  \u20ac100,000  gross)  had  been  decided  in  order  to  sustainably\n\nsupport  purchasing  power.  This  measure  had  affected  more than 80% of Amundi's employees. It was put in place on 1 July 2022.  As the economic context remains marked by significant changes in the level of inflation,  an  agreement  on  exceptional measures  in  favour  of  purchasing  power  was  concluded  in January  2023,  notably  providing  for  the  payment  of  a  value sharing  bonus.  A  first  payment  of  \u20ac800  was  made  for employees with a gross annual fixed compensation of less than or equal to \u20ac90,000.\n\nIn order to continue its commitment to the purchasing power of  its  employees,  in  addition  to  this  first  payment,  Amundi decided  to  make  a  second  payment  in  July  2023,  in  the amount of \u20ac1,000.  The year 2023 was also marked by the negotiation  on  professional  equality  between  women  and men,  during  which  Amundi  reaffirmed  its  commitment  to equal  opportunities  involving  fair  treatment  and  nondiscrimination  of  employees  in  the  professional  context. Amundi continues its actions to promote an inclusive culture, guarantee  equal  opportunities  on  all  its  HR  processes, support parenthood and single parenthood, and act against sexism, harassment and violence (see 3.4.4).\n\nIn addition, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. group has concluded a new international  framework  agreement  with  UNI  Global  Union, which  includes  Amundi.  Over  a  period  of  four  years,  it reinforces  the  Group's  commitments  on  human  rights, fundamental labour rights, trade union rights as well as the continuous  development  of  social  dialogue  and  collective bargaining.  In  line  with  its  Human  Project,  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole S.A. group is committed to continuing its actions in terms of accountability  and  quality  of  life  at  work.  Finally,  the agreement includes a new strong commitment to parenthood: the implementation of a paid paternity leave of 28  calendar  days  for  all  its  employees.  This  commitment echoes the one made in the first global agreement concluded in 2019, which established a paid maternity leave of 16 weeks for all its employees.\n\n## 3.4.5.2 Measuring employee commitment\n\nAmundi conducts an annual survey called the \"Accountability Index\" among its employees to measure their commitment. This approach has been taken by all the entities of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. group. In 2023, Amundi carried out the survey in France and in all its other places of business around the world. More than 5,300 employees were approached. The participation rate was 82%. More specifically, the Amundi's recommendation score is 80% and Amundi's pride in belonging score is 86%.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

As has been the case every year since 2018, a capital  increase  transaction  reserved  for  employees  was carried  out  in  mid-2023.  This  transaction  offered  eligible employees the opportunity to subscribe to Amundi shares at a 30% discount on the market price for the fourth consecutive year.\n\nMore  than  2,000  employees,  present  in  15  countries,  have subscribed to this capital increase.\n\nThis  transaction,  which  falls  within  the  framework  of  the existing legal authorisations approved  by  the  General Shareholders' Meeting of 12 May 2023, reflects Amundi's desire to involve its employees  not  only  in  the  company's development,  but  also  in  the  creation  of  economic  value.  It also  strengthens  their  sense  of  belonging.  The  portion  of employee share ownership in Amundi's capital now represents nearly 1.5%.\n\n## 3.4.6 A long-standing commitment to sponsorship and solidarity actions\n\n## 3.4.6.1 Corporate Sponsorship Actions\n\nThe Sponsorship Committee, consisting of five members, was established in 2021. It meets twice a year to consider various requests  for  institutional  support  for  causes  related  to culture,  education,  solidarity  and  the  environment.  The allocation  procedure  is  composed  of  five  phases:  analysis, decision, conclusion of the contract, control and traceability.\n\nIn  the  area  of  culture,  Amundi  has  continued  the  support provided for nearly 20 years to Villa Medicis, of which it is the main sponsor, as well as to the Ch\u00e2teau de Vaux le Vicomte, of  which  it  has  been  a  partner  since  2019.  Amundi  also contributes sustainably to regional preservation and development through the  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  Pays  de  France Foundation. In addition, Amundi has signed an agreement in France  to  support  the  National  Guard,  to  strengthen  the commitment  of  the  company  and  reservists  to  community service, and to encourage values such as courage, team spirit and solidarity.\n\nAround  the  world,  directly,  or through its subsidiaries, Amundi is committed, at different  scales  of  geography  and duration. The year 2023 was thus marked by numerous acts of solidarity.\n\nSome are related to current events. This is the case with the ongoing conflict in Ukraine: Luxembourg has supported the living  conditions  of  displaced  populations  on  the  Moldovan border  with  the Concordia  SozialProjekte association.  The Group  and  the  subsidiaries  have  also  made  donations following  natural  disasters,  sometimes  supplemented  by individual  donations  from  employees:  in  February,  for earthquakes in Syria and Turkey, in May and June, following floods  in  Emilia-Romagna,  and  in  September,  after  the earthquakes in Morocco.\n\nOther  actions  are  the  result  of  long-standing  and  regular commitments. France has been supporting Action Contre La Faim (an  association  that  fights  against  hunger  and  for development in  the  world)  for  13  years,  through  a  financial donation  amplified  by  the  participation  of  employees  in  a sporting challenge. The Singaporean entity has developed a new  charitable  component  in  its  collaboration  with  the Rainbow  Centre ,  which  welcomes  people  with  disabilities based  on  donations  and  volunteering  by  employees.  In Japan, since 2016, continuous support has been given to the Japanese Association against Childhood Cancer .\n\nIn the area of social inclusion in the broad sense, Amundi has financed a medical monitoring centre in Paris for the National Institute  for  Blind  Youth and  integrates  visually  impaired professionals. The US subsidiary continues its action in favour of  children's  literacy  with  the  associations 826  Boston and Raising a Reader MA , and fights against poverty with Rosie's Place , Home for Little Wanderers , On the Rise and Room To Grow .  Amundi  Ireland  has  been  supporting  (financially  and through  employee  volunteering) Dublin  Simon  Community for over fifteen years. This association helps homeless people and  people  in  situations  of  addiction.  The  Italian  entity continues to support PizzAut ,  a Milanese pizzeria exclusively employing young autistic people.\n\nAmong many initiatives related to education, Amundi's local subsidiaries  support  the  university  research  centres  at CCU and NCCU in Taiwan to develop local talent, the ESSEC Asset &  Risk  Management  Chair and  its  PhD  students,  the Stiftverband in Germany,  which  supports  science  and innovation among young audiences; and Italy has completed its three-year project, shared with other Italian entities of the Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  group,  to  improve  digital  skills  and  active citizenship in 100 schools for 6,000  students from disadvantaged regions.\n\nEnvironmental commitments multiplied in 2023. For example, in  Japan,  volunteers  participated  in  the  manufacture  of wooden  puzzles  in  a  facility  for  people  with  disabilities,  to help raise awareness  among  young  people  living  in specialised facilities about  the  preservation  of  forest resources. In a spirit of working together very closely, for the second  consecutive  year,  the  Czech  entity  organised reforestation  efforts  with  employees  in  order  to  restore natural environments and combat global warming. In another area, Amundi and particularly the CPR AM entity support the Maud Fontenoy Foundation for the distribution of educational kits on the protection of the sea in schools.",

        "page_content": "Everywhere, Amundi ensures that its institutional commitments make sense in relation to its activity as a fund manager.  For  example,  in  Spain,  an  Ethics  Committee  is dedicated to allocating part of the management fees of the local  fund  \"Sabadell  Inversi\u00f3n  \u00c9tica  y  Solidaria\"  to  social inclusion  and  development  projects  in  Spain,  Kenya,  Brazil and Ethiopia; Japan participates in the Mirai E-us project and pays  part  of  the  trust  commissions  of  the  funds  (Medtech, Education Fund, Income Opportunity Fund) to two foundations  that  organise  scholarships  for  disadvantaged students.  CPR  AM  donates  3%  of  the  management  fees\n\ncollected  each  year  by  the  CPR  Invest  -  Education  fund  to associations  that  promote  education  and  access  to  the  job market.  On  a  different  axis,  the  diversity  of  the  teams, Amundi UK continued its action with the association GAIN -Girls Are Investors , to promote the emergence of female and non-binary candidates starting in the investment management  professions  -  with  the  establishment  of  pairs for two weeks in the premises. Finally, an example of financial education:  the  Belgian  entity  facilitates  financial  education games  for  children  from  all school backgrounds,  in connection with the King Baudoin Foundation .\n\n## 3.4.6.2 Employee engagement in solidarity initiatives\n\nAmundi's commitment to social responsibility has also led to involving individual employees in solidarity projects.\n\nIn France, for the 11 th consecutive year, Amundi organised its annual Give A Hand sponsorship programme which supports solidarity  projects  of  employees  invested  in  associations: thirty-three projects on humanitarian causes, the environment, disability, health or social issues were presented  by  employees,  and  were  the  subject  of  internal awareness  and  co-financing  by  Amundi.  Employees  have once again generously contributed to the clothes drive (for people  in  rehabilitation  accompanied  in  particular  by  the associations La  Cravate  Solidaire or Wrap  Up  London )  and toy  drives  (for  the  renovation  and  resale  sector  led  by  the associations Rejou\u00e9 or Secours  Populaire ):  approaches  that are  both  supportive,  social  and  ecological.  Once  again,  a large number of employees committed themselves to the day of  sharing  and  discovering  the  world  of  the  company Duo Day, during  which  twenty  schoolchildren  and  young  adults with  disabilities  were  welcomed  in  the  Parisian  premises. Finally, mentoring partnerships are developing for the benefit of  young  people  in  fragile  regions  in  the  cultural  and professional fields  in  order  to  give  them  the  opportunity  to develop  their  full  potential;  such  is  the  case  in  Ireland  with Basis Point and in France with T\u00e9l\u00e9maque . Inclusive initiatives include  the  investment  of  teams  from  Great  Britain  in students  with The  Switch association  (mentoring)  and assisting  homeless  people  in  London  with The  Felix  Project (meal preparation and distribution). Employees of the Fund Channel in Luxembourg have assisted women unable to find employment  by  coaching  and  equipping  them  with  skills through the association Dress For Success .\n\nThe ESG Challenge initiative brought together more than 450 employees in more than 90 teams in 17 countries to support 4 M\u00e9decins  Sans  Fronti\u00e8res projects  (purchase  of  4,975 emergency  food  rations  of  500  g),  the  International Committee  of  the Red  Cross , Action  Against  Hunger (purchase of 55 ceramic filters to treat more than 2,222 litres of  water  per  day  in  communities  without  access  to  water), Reforest'Action (planting  of  4,676  trees  in  Indonesia,  South Africa, Iceland and Peru).  In 2023, Amundi mobilised again as  part  of  the  annual  global  event  \"Earth  Day\"  whose purpose  is  to  raise  awareness  of  the  need  to  preserve  the planet's resources. In Paris, about 600  employees participated in awareness-raising workshops.\n\nFor 2023, we can also highlight:\n\n- -The multiplying  of  local  efforts  carried  out  by  employees through  local  associations;  for  example,  in  Slovakia,  with Dobry  skutok which  particularly  supports  the  daily  life  of people  with  mental  or  physical  disabilities;  in  the  Czech Republic, with Domov Sulick\u00e1 which provides accommodation for families in distress and whose children have been able to receive end-of-year gifts.\n- -the  sustainability  of  employee  commitment.  Those  in Dublin  who  have  been  involved  in  activities  with  the Barretstown association  for  17  years,  working  to  maintain and  improve  a  place  for  children  with  serious  illnesses  in the countryside. In the United States, employees continue to  \"give  back\"  to  local  communities  and  charitable organisations through 175 annual actions, accompanied by the  US  Helping  Others  Program  of  the  US  entity,  which receives generous individual financial donations as part of a Matching Gift Program.\n- -the  variety  of  charitable  fundraising  activities  that  took place this year, following the natural disasters in February in  Syria  and  Turkey  (coordinated  campaigns  of  individual donations for the Red Cross/Red Crescent by Austrian and Irish employees, and for the association People in Need by Czech  employees,  all  three  received  generous  support from  the  subsidiaries);  or  in  sports  (golf  tournament  in Japan, race in Singapore for SportCares for the benefit  of youth  inclusion  programs,  etc.)  or  cultural  (a  charity concert  in  the  Czech  Republic  for  the  benefit  of  patients with amyotrophic  lateral  sclerosis), as well as the development  of  salary  rounding  schemes  in  France ( Microdon ) and the United Kingdom ( Give As You Earn ): so many  individual  donations  matched  equally  by  the company.\n\nThus, throughout the world, Amundi and Amundi's employees continue to engage in many solidarity projects. In the  year  2023,  the  annual  amount  paid  by  Amundi  for sponsoring and solidarity activities amounted to \u20ac2.3 million.\n\n## Amundi's commitments\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

More than 3,600 employees in thirty countries have already attended a Climate Fresk workshop and more than 140 have wished to become in-house Climate Fresk ambassadors. The roll-out is ongoing  in  order  to  raise  awareness  among  all  employees who wish to participate.\n\n## \"Go Green\" initiative\n\nIn  France  and  abroad,  Amundi  regularly  encourages  its employees  to  adopt  eco-friendly  practices.  All  newcomers have  an  eco-friendly Welcome  Box consisting  of  recycled cutlery, eco-friendly cups and a Gobi to eliminate plastic. The packaging of the set given to the employee is prepared by a Work-Based Support Establishment or Services (1) .\n\nThe Go-Green actions of previous years had made it possible: to  remove  plastic  cups  from  coffee  machines  or  plastic cutlery, to remove individual printers or to raise awareness of responsible printing and waste sorting and reduction.\n\n## Eco-friendly practices\n\nThe  participation  of  employees  in  day-to-day  eco-friendly acts is enriched each year by new initiatives:\n\n- \u00b7 on the occasion of Earth Day, awareness-raising campaigns  have  been  organised  in  several  countries:  in France,  more  than  600  employees  participated  in  ecoresponsible manufacturing workshops for hygiene products,  more  than  130  Amundi  employees  in  eight countries  (Ireland,  Japan,  Hong  Kong,  United  States) mobilised  and  participated  in  collective  actions  to  clean beaches, cities and rivers;\n- \u00b7 a  responsible  digital  guide  was  made  available  to  all employees in September 2023;\n- \u00b7 during the year-end celebrations, the children of employees are invited to participate in a Climate Fresco for juniors;\n- \u00b7 the promotion of eco-responsible means of travel such as in Luxembourg, Germany, and Ireland, and the implementation  of  the  Sustainable  Mobility  Package  in France.",

(See 3.5.4.1.).\n\nThe year 2023 concludes with:\n\n- \u00b7 a very significant decrease in energy-related CO2 emissions,  reflecting  efforts  to  reduce  consumption  in  a context of energy crisis (down 68% compared to 2018);\n- \u00b7 a  controlled  and  desirable  recovery  in  business  travelrelated emissions (down 52% compared to 2018) following the end of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nAmundi will  publish  its  new  carbon  footprint  assessment  in 2024  based  on  2023  data.

Other countries, such as Germany and Austria, have been using 100% green electricity for several years.\n\nIn  2023,  Italy  and  Japan  benefited  from  the  full  year  effect  of changing their sources of supply to renewable electricity.\n\n## Building environmental certification\n\nAmundi's  registered  office  at  91  boulevard  Pasteur  in  Paris complies  with  environmental  standards.  It  is  labelled  BBC (2) Effinergie, certified HQE Exploitation (3) and BREEAM (4) .\n\nIn  2019,  Amundi  undertook,  for  a  5-year  cycle,  the  complete renewal of the \"HQE B\u00e2timents Tertiaires en Exploitation\" (High Environmental  Quality  -  Tertiary  Buildings  in  Operation) certification,  issued  by  an  external  body  (Certiv\u00e9a).  Thanks  to the  implementation  of  regular  improvement  actions,  Amundi has  obtained  the  maximum  \"Outstanding\"  level  on  the Management and Sustainable Use axes.\n\nIn  Paris,  the  Amundi  Village  project,  started  in  2021,  had  the primary  objective  of  moving  from  Agoram  90,  a  high-energy building  from  the  1970s,  to  more  environmentally  friendly buildings:\n\n- \u00b7 Deskopolitan,  located  in  the  15 th arrondissement,  whose owner has initiated a BREEAM RFO (Refurbishment and Fit Out)  certification  process  and  is  awaiting  a  reply  from  the certifying  body  with  the  objective  of  achieving  the Very Good level;\n- \u00b7 Tomb-Issoire in the 14 th arrondissement, whose landlord has obtained  the  BREEAM  RFO  (Refurbishment  and  Fit  Out)  Very  Good certification and  is  also  awaiting  the  BBC Effinergie R\u00e9novation Energy Performance Label and the NF HQE  R\u00e9novation  B\u00e2timent  Tertiaire  [Renovation  Tertiary Building]  HQE  Renovation  certification  -  with  the  goal  of achieving Exceptional level.\n\nFive  Amundi  sites  in  Munich,  Frankfurt,  Boston,  Taiwan  and Milan are also situated at LEED Platinum-certified premises.\n\n## Continuous improvement approach\n\nIn accordance with the regulations, Amundi's Parisian buildings are subject to regular external energy audits. The last audit was carried  out  in  2023.  Amundi  is  continuing  the  actions undertaken  since  2015  by  improving  the  management  and control of technical facilities, reducing the operating time slots of  CTAs [1] ,  replacing  lights  with  LED,  and  installing  window contacts to cut off the fan coils in the event of opening.\n\nA  process  to  improve  the  energy  efficiency  of  sites  is  also underway  in  all  international  entities,  favouring  low-energy electronic  devices  and  optimising  automated  lighting,  heating and  air  conditioning  systems.  Since  2022,  several  entities including  Austria,  Ireland,  Germany,  the  United  Kingdom  and the United States have continued their actions to generalise the use  of  LEDs  and  systematise  the  installation  of  presence detectors.\n\nAll  entities  also  reinstated  the  automatic  computer  switch-on/ off system that had been suspended during the pandemic.\n\n## Energy efficiency\n\nIn line with the \"Energy Restraint Emergency\" plan launched by the  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  group  at  the  instigation  of  the  French government  in  2022,  Amundi  is  committed  to  continuing  in 2023 the actions taken to reduce its electricity consumption:\n\n- \u00b7 limiting the temperature of offices in winter;\n- \u00b7 maintaining a minimum temperature of 24\u00b0C in summer;\n- \u00b7 switching off illuminated signs;\n- \u00b7 removing hot water from the kitchen areas on each floor and from toilet blocks;\n- \u00b7 limiting  lighting  in  corridors  and  communal  areas  (in accordance with French regulations);\n- \u00b7 adapting  the  power  consumption  of  office  equipment  (e.g. switching  off  computers  fully,  placing  printers  on  standby more quickly).\n\nA similar plan has been introduced in other European countries, notably Italy.\n\n## Travel\n\nWith  the  end  of  the  global  pandemic,  the  year  2023  was marked by a controlled recovery in business travel.\n\nAmundi's travel policy, applicable to all its  entities  around  the world,  demonstrates  its  desire  to  reduce  its  CO2  missions. Among  other  things,  it  imposes  the  requirement  for  prior authorisation from a member of senior management for foreign travel, compulsory rail travel for journeys of less than three hours and the categorisation of hire vehicles according to the number of passengers. Several years ago, new functionality was added to the reservation system to strengthen the justification for travel (within the Group or outside it, for a conference or a client visit, for  example)  and  to  avoid  travel  when  a  video-conference  is more  appropriate.  The  Company  will  continue  its  efforts  to reduce  its  carbon  footprint  by  2025,  by  reducing  emissions related  to  business  travel  (scope  3)  by  30%  per  employee compared  to  the  reference  year  of  2018.  In  2023,  a  tool  for monitoring business travel-related carbon emissions was made available to managers to facilitate monitoring the achievement of this objective.\n\nAmundi  also  encourages  its  employees  to  reduce  their emissions  during  their  commute  to  work.  It  contributes  to public  transport  expenses  in  order  to  ensure  its  employees prioritise  these  forms  of  transport.  In  France,  Amundi  covers 90%  of  public  transport  expenses  (e.g.  Navigo  card  or  V\u00e9lib' card in Paris).\n\nIn  France,  Ireland,  Italy  and  the  United  Kingdom,  Amundi  is putting aid in place to encourage its employees to use bicycles to  get  to  their  workplace:  setting  up  the  sustainable  mobility package  worth  \u20ac700  per  year  in  France,  self-service  bicycle offering  or  even  an  increase  in  the  number  of  bicycle  parking spaces.\n\nIn France, several electric charging points have been installed in Amundi  car  parks.  When  selecting  company  cars,  Amundi favours the use of fuel-efficient and hybrid vehicles.",

        "page_content": "## Monitoring direct environmental footprint through the Greenway platform\n\nSince 2021, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. group has implemented a nonfinancial information producing platform, called Greenway. This tool,  which  ensures,  among  other  things,  the  monitoring  of direct  environmental  footprint  indicators,  is  used  to  steer  the CO2 emission reduction trajectory. It calculates and reports key indicators that are quantified, transparent and auditable.\n\n## Amundi carbon offsetting\n\nSince 2019, Amundi has been part of the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. carbon offset programme, via the Livelihoods funds, to offset its  residual  CO2  emissions  related  to  energy  and  business commutes,  i.e.  6,400  tonnes  of  CO2  per  year.  These  funds finance agroforestry, rural energy and ecosystem restoration projects.\n\n## 3.5.2.2 Other actions to reduce the environmental footprint\n\n## Responsible use of paper\n\nAmundi has  a  responsible  paper  policy  both  in  France  and abroad,  aimed  at  reducing  consumption,  increasing  the  use of eco-friendly paper and recycling used paper.\n\n- \u00b7 Office equipment is subject to specific measures. In France, invoices  are  paperless.  Printers  in  all  locations  are configured  by  default  to  print  in  black  and  white  and double-sided. Printing can only be performed with a swipe card. Reams of paper are certified and low-weight.\n- \u00b7 An increasing number of documents are paperless. When printing is necessary, communication materials are printed on certified paper. The printers used have the Imprim'Vert label.\n- \u00b7 With  regard  to  electronic  publishing,  Amundi  ESR,  the account-keeping  subsidiary  responsible  for  employee savings schemes, continued its efforts to reduce its paper consumption. The subscription rate for its e-services offer reached 77.2% in 2023, an increase of +2.7% compared to 2022,  making  it  possible  to  continue  reducing  paper consumption per managed account.\n\nFinally, several initiatives were launched or continued in 2023 to reduce paper consumption or increase the use of recycled paper.  At  the  Paris  headquarters,  the  process  of  switching newspaper and magazine subscriptions to digital versions is ongoing. In the United Kingdom, only 10% of employees still subscribe  to  paper  publications.  Contracts  are  signed electronically and receipts from the company restaurant are no  longer  automatically  printed.  Internationally,  several entities  are  also  continuing  their  efforts  to  go  paperless: creation  of  electronic  signatures  in  Italy,  digitalisation  of meeting handouts and reports.\n\n## Responsible waste management\n\nAmundi has implemented a responsible waste management policy for several years in France and has promoted selective sorting  through  the  voluntary  use  of  recycling  bins  since 2013.\n\nIn 2023, 86% of the waste produced was recycled.\n\nRecyclable  waste  (paper,  plastic  cups  and  bottles,  cans, printer consumables, batteries, and waste from electrical and electronic equipment - WEEE) is taken care of by CEDRE, a sheltered  workshop  employing  people  with  disabilities.  In addition  to  selective  sorting,  Amundi  annually  launches  a Cleaning Weeks operation in its Parisian buildings to sort and dispose of unnecessary paper.\n\nBiodegradable  consumables  were  introduced  into  the cafeteria  of  the  Paris  site  from  2019.  The  grease  traps  are biologically  treated  in-house  in  both  buildings  (Procession and Tombe-Issoire),  resulting  in  less  waste  and  fewer  truck movements to clean the traps and dispose of the grease at an external station.\n\nFor  the  new  restaurants,  some  dishes  are  cooked  in  an external  facility,  which  in  the  long  term  will  lead  to  a decrease  in  the  bio-waste  generated  locally  (of  which vegetables represent on average 60%).\n\nEvery  year,  Amundi  strives  to  integrate  more  recyclable materials  into  its  sorting  line.  In  2018,  a  cigarette  butt recycling  initiative  was  installed  at  our  buildings  in  Paris. In 2021, this was supplemented by a system for sorting used pens, and in 2022, one for surgical masks and coffee grounds (the new coffee machines in France no longer use capsules). Today, some 10 waste sorting streams have been set up in Parisian buildings.\n\nSince  1  January  2023,  hazardous  waste  mainly  from  multitechnical maintenance activities is now traced and monitored on Trackd\u00e9chets, the digital  tool  developed  by  the  Ministry of Ecological Transition in France.\n\nIn the UK, Austria and Ireland, capsules are recycled. And in Japan,  waste  sorting  bins  can  be  used  to  sort  15  different types of waste.\n\n## Reducing food waste\n\nThe company's catering partner in Paris has implemented a fine management of its services, in order to limit as much as possible the part not consumed, not reusable on a daily basis.\n\n## Building cleaning products\n\nAs  part  of  the  performance  of  their  services,  our  cleaning partners at our Parisian and European sites use eco-labelled cleaning products.\n\n## Removing plastic\n\nIn Japan, recyclable bags are made available to employees to reduce the use of disposable bags when shopping for lunch outside. In France, coffee machine cups were removed early in 2020. In Italy, plastic coffee stirrers were replaced in 2021 by 100% recyclable wooden stirrers. In Ireland, stirrers were completely  removed  in  2020.  And  coffee  breaks  in  the United  States  are  now  entirely  plastic-free.  In  the  various locations,  the  use  of  glass  bottles  to  replace  plastic  is gradually becoming more widespread.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

In 2023, 2,700 landline  phones,  458  duplicate  devices,  18  printers  and  5 copying machines were removed.\n\nElectricity  consumption  is  controlled:  all  the  equipment intended for users (screens, workstations, telephones, printers)  is  in  accordance  with  international  energy  saving standards and norms. Likewise, all IT equipment purchased is TCO-certified.  This  label  is  awarded  to  high-quality,  lowenergy electronic equipment that reduces environmental and health  risks.  Personal  computers,  shared  printers  and  all equipment that can be, are all switched off at night.\n\nShopping  habits  are  changing:  more  than  460  pieces  of equipment  have  been  repaired  and  the  lifespan  of  laptops has been extended to five years, that of desktop computers to six years, that of screens to seven to ten years and that of smartphones to 4 years. Finally, 92 e-SIMs were deployed on personal mobile phones to avoid replacing physical devices.\n\n## 3.5.4 Responsible purchasing\n\nCr\u00e9dit  Agricole  S.A.  group  has  a  Responsible  Procurement Policy (2) that contributes to the company's overall performance.  This  policy  is  part  of  the  Group's  Ethical Charter  and  is  based  on  commitments  including  the  United Nations  Global  Compact,  the  Diversity  Charter  and  the Charter on the Mediation of Responsible Supplier Relations. All  of  the  commitments  set  forth  in  these  texts  relate  to respect  for  human  rights  and  compliance  with  labour\n\n## 3.5.4.1  Decarbonisation of purchases\n\nIn  order  to  reduce  greenhouse  gas  emissions  linked  to purchases, Amundi wishes to work with suppliers committed to reducing their own carbon footprint. Thus, Amundi has set itself the objective of making at least 35% of its purchases of goods  and  services,  outside  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  S.A.  group,  by 2025, with suppliers with science-based Net Zero objectives.\n\nSince 2022, a qualitative assessment of the carbon footprint of a purchased good or service has been carried out during calls for tender, based on the information communicated by the bidder, the methodology it adopts and its action plan.\n\nRecycling is preferred at the end of life: all office computer equipment (workstations, printers, portable microcomputers, small equipment, etc.) are recycled with the service provider ATF GAIA, a WEEE (1) certified  company  that  has  signed  an agreement  with  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  S.A.  group.  Hardware  that cannot be resold is automatically sent to a certified partner.\n\nAmundi  also  recycles  its  stock  of  used  cartridges.  Bins  for collecting used toner cartridges are provided on all floors. In the United  States,  an  end-of-life  device  management programme  is  in  place.  Devices  are  recycled  or  put  up  for sale on the second-hand market.\n\nThe development of the application portfolio and use of the cloud is mastered:  limited  growth  in  the  number  of applications (including during integration operations), mainly use of open source ,  implementation of the FinOps approach to optimise i-cloud resources, for example.\n\nFinally,  Amundi  is  implementing  innovative  solutions  to improve  energy  efficiency:  the  new  generation  of data centres has made it possible to improve energy efficiency by 30%,  in  particular  by  creating  cold  corridors  reducing  the consumption of air conditioning.\n\nregulations, the fight against all forms of discrimination, the promotion of diversity, environmental protection and business ethics.\n\nIn  2023,  Amundi  joined  the  CSR  projects  of  the  Cr\u00e9dit Agricole  group's  Medium-Term  Procurement  Plan  on  three topics:  the  decarbonisation  of  purchases,  the  inclusion  and the optimisation of the time frame for processing invoices.\n\nMore generally, Amundi considers CSR risk when evaluating these  suppliers.  Thus  the  weighting  of  CSR  in  the  multicriteria analysis grids of short list offers increased from 15 to 35% in 2022. Following the rating campaigns that have been in  place  since  2020  with  Ecovadis  (trusted  third  party), Amundi  began  monitoring  the  CSR  risk  of  suppliers (Ecovadis rating <35) in its ongoing audits. Quarterly reports are  provided  to  all  buyers/business  lines  at  Purchasing Committee meetings,  to  alert  them  to  the  economic,  social and environmental risks involved. At the end of 2023, 99% of Ecovadis-rated Amundi suppliers had a score above 35.\n\nFurthermore,  Amundi  contributed  to  the  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole group  study  to  identify  non-financial  rating  companies  in order to assess the possibilities of extending coverage on the one hand and deepening CSR criteria on the other.",

        "page_content": "## 3.5.4.2 Inclusion\n\nThe Agricole Group intends to make purchasing a driver of employment  for  vulnerable  groups,  thus  contributing  to employment in the regions. It identifies inclusive services in its  expenses.  It  trains  its  buyers,  according  to  various purchasing  types:  interbank  disability  information  sheets have been drawn up in order to increase awareness among suppliers in various business sectors (communication, events, marketing,  administrative  services,  IT,  general  services, waste treatment, printing and reprographics, catering).\n\n## 3.5.4.3 Optimising invoice processing times\n\nIn  2023,  new  communication  campaigns  were  launched  to inform  suppliers  that  they  could  send  their  invoices  to  a dedicated email address. In the event of a delay or dispute, a generic  second-level  address  makes  it  possible  to  process their  reminders  as  soon  as  possible.  All  suppliers  were  also reminded to send their invoices within a maximum period of 7 days from the date of issue of the invoice.\n\nAmundi is part of this approach by entrusting \u20ac0.5 million in 2023  to  companies  in  the  protected  and  adapted  work sector  (EA/ESAT (1) ),  an  amount  which  has  increased  12% compared  to  2022.    For  example,  since  January  2023,  the operation  of  the  reprography  centre  has  been  entrusted  to an Adapted Company (EA) for a period of three years.\n\nDetailed monthly reporting has been put in place to facilitate the accurate management of invoice processing times.\n\nInvoices awaiting processing are also the subject of a weekly report,  communicated  to  the  Finance  Department  and  the business lines in charge of validating them. In France in 2023, the  percentage  of  invoices  paid  on  time  is  87%,  up  5 percentage points from the previous year.\n\n## 3.6 DUTY OF VIGILANCE AND RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS\n\n## 3.6.1 The application of the duty of vigilance\n\nThe French law relating to the parent companies' and ordering companies' duty of vigilance (2) applies  to  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  S.A. group.\n\nAs a parent company, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A., a corporate entity, has chosen to draw up a vigilance action plan and to report on the effective  implementation  of  this  plan  for  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  S.A.  group.  In  accordance  with  the  law,  this  vigilance  plan  includes specific  reasonable  measures  to  identify  the  risks  and  to  prevent  serious  infringements  of  human  rights  and  fundamental freedoms, or the health and safety of persons and the environment, which could potentially result from the activity of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole SA, including Amundi.\n\nThe details  of  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  S.A.  group's  vigilance  action  plan  can  be  found  in  Chapter  3  of  its  2023  Universal  Registration Document.\n\n## 3.6.2 Respect for human rights\n\nThe  commitment  to  respect  human  rights  is  fundamental  at Amundi, both as an advocate of responsible management and as an employer. Respect for human rights is one of the criteria used  to  rate  issuers  and,  together  with  the  environmental criteria, constitutes the basis for Amundi's exclusion policy (see section  3.2.2.4).  Specifically,  respect  for  human  rights  is  taken into account in the ESG rating via the \"Local communities and human rights\" criterion. When a business commits serious and repeated  human  rights  violations  without  taking  effective measures to remedy those violations, this constitutes a breach of the  10  principles  of  the  Global  Compact.  Following discussions with that business, Amundi can therefore exclude it from  its  investment  universe.  For  several  years,  Amundi  has maintained  a  shareholder  commitment  with  many  companies on the subject of the living wage in order to ensure that direct\n\nemployees, regardless of their country of establishment and the development of social law in that country, receive a salary that enables them to live with dignity and to meet their needs and those of their family. The results of this commitment are used to refine  the  ESG  rating  of  companies  supplied  by  Amundi  and taken  into  account  by  investment  managers  when  setting  up funds.  The  human  rights  dimension  is  also  present  in  the analysis of the supply chain of certain sectors where vigilance is required in order to prevent human rights violations in some of them. Amundi's commitment is also reflected in its HR policy: actions  in  favour  of  diversity,  fight  against  discrimination, importance given to social dialogue and collective bargaining, and respect for freedom of association (see section 3.4).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Amundi  is  a  member (the list is not exhaustive) of: AFG (1) , EFAMA, AMAFI, ORSE, EpE and  the  French,  Canadian,  Japanese  and  Australian  forums  for responsible  investment  FIR,  Spainsif  (Spanish)  and  Swesif (Swedish). Amundi is also a member of FAIR.\n\nThe  Chief  Executive  Officer  of  Amundi  chairs  the  Coll\u00e8ge  des Investisseurs  de  Paris-Europlace  and  a  member  of  the  Senior Management  is  part  of  the  executive  board  of  the  Institute  of Sustainable Finance (IFD), formerly Finance for Tomorrow .\n\nThe Director of Governance and Public Affairs of Amundi chairs the Paris-Europlace Working Group on financial and non-financial data.  Finally,  another  member  of  the  Responsible  Investment Department represents the European Fund and Asset Management  Association (EFAMA)  on  the Sustainability Reporting Board of EFRAG, the entity responsible for providing technical  support  to  the  European  Commission  in  order  to establish European non-financial reporting standards.\n\nAs a major player in asset management, Amundi has maintained its active participation, directly or through market associations, in the work and consultations regarding European projects for the regulation  of  ESG  investment,  including: Disclosure Regulation both for the extension of delegated acts and for the evaluation of this regulation,  Taxonomy  Regulation , delegated  acts  and guidelines of the European supervisory authorities relating to the integration of sustainable  client preferences  and  product governance (MiFID2), redesign of the French SRI label, guidelines\n\non  the  \"ESG\"  designation  of  funds, Corporate  Sustainability Reporting Directive  and  delegated  acts  determining  European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS)... Amundi contributed to  the  work  of  the  AFG,  in  particular  that  of  the  \"Responsible Investment  Committee,\"  as  well  as  to  its  equivalents  within EFAMA or other local associations. Amundi strives to reconcile the  effectiveness  of  markets  and  of  its  asset  management business  with  the  promotion  of  a  more  responsible  investment model. As a European leader in asset management and pioneer of responsible investment, Amundi seeks to share its vision and expertise  with  a  range  of  different  European  stakeholders  and institutions.\n\nMore generally, Amundi has contributed to the regulatory work carried  out  by  the  AFG,  France  Invest,  ASPIM  and  AMAFI  and Paris  Europlace  for  France,  as  well  as  that  of  the  EFAMA  in Brussels  and  the  ICMA  in  London.  Amundi's  subsidiaries  in Europe  also  belong  to  the  professional  associations  of  their respective  countries.  Furthermore,  Amundi  has  made  a  direct contribution  to  European  and  French  regulatory  work.  Thus,  in 2023,  Amundi  responded  to  more  than  a  dozen  public consultations on European or French regulations under development  or  revision.  Finally,  Amundi  applies  strict  rules  of professional  conduct  in  its  interactions  with  the  French  and European  authorities,  as  set  out  in  the  Amundi  Group  Code  of Conduct  (Chapter  18),  and  also  complies  with  European  and French transparency regulations (making declarations to the EU transparency register and the HATVP - the French high authority for transparency in public life - respectively).",

The  main  aim  of  these  investor coalitions  is  to  urge  governments  to  adopt  incentives  and encourage companies to improve their ESG practices. These initiatives contribute in particular to the development of tools and  methodologies  that  facilitate  the  integration  of  ESG issues within corporate governance and asset management.\n\nAmundi  contributes  to  this  collaborative  commitment  by providing  expertise  on  responsible  investment  and,  where applicable,  logistical  support.

Assets in the portfolio that can  be  rated  (excluding  derivatives  or  government-issued securities,  for  example)  are  used  in  the  calculation  of  the portfolio's  carbon  footprint.  Amundi  has  developed  two carbon footprint indicators: carbon emissions in million euros invested  and  carbon  emissions  in  million  euros  of  revenue. These  data  and  methodologies  are  used  in  fund  reporting and  to  clarify  Amundi's  strategy  in  order  to  reduce  the carbon footprint of investment portfolios.",

Amundi  has chosen to calculate its carbon emissions on scopes 1, 2 and 3, which  correspond  to  the  entity's  direct  and  indirect emissions. The data was collected over 2021 for all Amundi Group entities with more than 100 employees, i.e. a coverage rate  of  87%.  The  data  was  extrapolated  for  entities  with fewer than 100 employees.\n\n## HR data\n\nThe HR reporting scope covers the entire Amundi Group as at 31 December 2023. The workforce of the consolidated and non-consolidated  Amundi  Group  entities  is  taken  into account (excluding minority joint ventures).\n\nCertain HR indicators are only available for France. This data is  identified  as  such  in  the  table  of  indicators.

Inflation  declined  considerably,  although  it  remained  above central  banks'  targets  at  the  end  of  the  year.  Growth  was surprisingly strong in the United States, Europe avoided the severe  recession  expected  at  the  start  of  the  year,  and activity remained buoyant overall in the emerging economies (despite  a  disappointing  recovery  in  China).  The  central banks  of  advanced  economies  continued  their  rate  hikes,  a move that was widely perceived to have come to an end by the  end  of  the  year,  while  some  central  banks  in  the emerging economies were already starting to lower rates. On the markets, bond yields hit new highs before falling sharply at the very end of the year, while most equity indices posted strong gains.\n\n## Eurozone\n\nAt  the  beginning  of  2023,  there  were  serious  fears  that economic activity would collapse due to difficulties with natural gas  supplies.  However,  energy  prices  fell  rapidly  and  the expected  sharp  recession  did  not  materialise.  However, economic activity failed to accelerate later  in  the  year,  mainly due to difficulties specific to the industrial sector and the rise in interest rates. Over the first three quarters, GDP in the eurozone remained  virtually  unchanged.  Over  the  same  period,  due  to the nature of their economies (more services and less industry), France and Spain grew slightly faster than Germany and Italy.\n\n## 2.9 %\n\n2023 INFLATION RATE EUROZONE\n\nInflation, for its part, has fallen sharply: in December 2023, the 12-month rise in the general consumer price index was just 2.9% (compared  with  9.2%  in  December  2022),  with  a  3.4%  rise  in the underlying index (compared with 5.2%). The ECB raised its key  rates  six  times,  at  each  of  its  monetary  policy  meetings (every 6 weeks or so) from February to September, taking its deposit rate to 4.0% (compared with 2.0% at end-2022). It then halted  this  trend;  however,  by  the  end  of  the  year,  it  had  not committed to any imminent rate cuts.\n\n## United States\n\nThe  US  economy  withstood  the  sharp  rise  in  interest  rates much better than expected. Over the first three quarters of the year, GDP grew by 2.3% (and even accelerated in Q3). In addition,  job  creation  averaged  over  200,000  per  month over the year - a very high figure - while the unemployment rate  remained  very  low  (3.7%  in  December).  These  strong figures  are  explained  by  the  abundant  savings  accumulated by households during the COVID crisis, the financial and cash reserves of companies (which allowed them to minimise the impact of rate increases) and budgetary measures favourable to investment. However,  a  slowdown  was  noticeable towards the end of the year. Inflation, for its part, fell sharply: in November, the 12-month rise in the consumer price index was  3.1%  (compared  with  6.5%  in  December  2022),  with  a 4.0% rise in the underlying index (compared with 5.7%). The Core PCE inflation index (monitored by the Federal Reserve), for  its  part,  was  up  by  3.2%  (compared  to  4.9%  in December 2022). The Federal Reserve raised rates four times between February and July, taking the upper limit of the Fed Funds rate to 5.5%. At the end of the year, it indicated that the pace of future rate cuts would be discussed.",

        "page_content": "## Emerging markets\n\nDespite a slowdown in the second half of the year, growth in emerging economies remained stable in annual terms (GDP growth of around 4%). It held up well against the headwinds of a disappointing recovery in China (especially in the second quarter), higher US and global interest rates and geopolitical crises and tensions. The slowdown in domestic demand and the  dissipation  of  negative  supply  shocks  have  led  to  a relative decline in inflation, which has gradually spread from prices  in  volatile  sectors  and  goods  to  inflation  in  services, which is more rigid. This trend allowed the central banks of emerging economies to start cutting key rates, even as the Federal Reserve continued to raise its rates. The movement began with all major central banks in Latin America, with the exception  of  Mexico,  and  spread  to  Central  and  Eastern Europe.  Economic  policies,  for  their  part,  have  moved  in  a more orthodox direction: in Brazil, President Lula has taken a cautious approach; in Turkey, President Erdogan has made a U-turn in  favour  of  a  more  traditional  policy,  while  the  new Argentine  President  Javier  Milei  was  elected  on  a  very ambitious liberal programme.\n\n## Rate\n\n2023  was  largely  divided  into  two  episodes.  The  first  saw yields  rise  until  the  end  of  October,  buoyed  up  by  resilient economies  and  the  determination  of  central  bankers  to maintain  relatively  restrictive  rates.  The  second  episode,  at the end of the year, was marked by a sharp fall in short- and long-term yields. US 10-year notes ended the year at around 3.8%, with German 10-year notes at around 2%. The market is also expecting the Federal Reserve and ECB to begin cutting rates in March. This rapid decline in yields can be explained by i)  a  stronger  than  expected  fall  in  inflation  in  developed economies,  and  ii)  a  change  in  tone  from  the  Federal Reserve, which has now returned to the point where its two mandates of \"inflation\" and \"employment\" are important. The Federal  Reserve  has  indeed  been  reassured  by  the  drop  in inflation, and FOMC members are now paying close attention to  the  impact  of  rate  rises  on  growth.  With  the  aim  of avoiding  an  excessive  slowdown  in  activity,  the  Federal Reserve does not want to restrain the economy any longer than necessary. Finally, iii) economic growth in the eurozone continues to be disappointing. However, the eurozone labour market  remains  solid.  The  markets  are  now  expecting inflation to quickly return to 2% without a recession.\n\n## Equities\n\n## +19.5 %\n\n2023 EQUITY MARKET INCREASE (MSCI WORLD AC) 2023\n\nEquity markets rose sharply in 2023, with the MSCI World AC up  19.5%  over  the  year.  Falling  global  inflation  and  the resilience  of  the  US  economy  were  the  main  catalysts  in 2023, along with the trend in long-term rates. Although US long-term  rates  rose  only  slightly  over  the  year,  they  did experience sharp movements, even passing the 5% mark in October. In addition to the good economic figures, the MSCI USA  index  (+25%)  benefited from the very strong performance  of  the  \"Magnificent  7\"  (Apple,  Microsoft, Alphabet,  Amazon,  Nvidia,  Meta,  Tesla).  Europe  (+11.2%) fared less well than its American counterpart. Within Europe, the  eurozone  stands  out  (+16%).  With  the  exception  of Portugal, Southern Europe comes out on top. Spain rose by +23.9%, closely followed by Italy (+27.2%). The Netherlands (+14.8%)  also  recorded  strong  growth  this  year,  finishing third.  The  other  Member  States  also  ended  the  year  in  the green,  with  Portugal  (+1.5%)  bringing  up  the  rear.  The Japanese  market  (+25.9%)  led  the  developed  markets, benefiting  from  the  fall  in  the  yen,  an  improving  economy and  encouraging  corporate  governance  reforms.  The  MSCI Emerging Markets Index closed the year in positive territory (+7.1%)  despite  the  very  poor  performance  of  the  Chinese market (-12.8%). All European sectors were in the green, with the  exception  of  consumer  goods  (-3.4%).  Interest-ratesensitive sectors fared well, led by IT services and technology (+32.9%),  followed  by  manufacturing  (+23.6%),  banking (+19.2%)  and  property  (+17.7%),  which  finally  recovered  at the  end  of  the  year.  Finally,  again  in  Europe,  value  stocks (+9.7%) slightly underperformed growth stocks (+12.8%).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\n<!-- image -->",

While  this performance remains positive, it is still a long way from 2021, which  saw  historic  net  inflows  of  around  +\u20ac2,500  billion euros.\n\n## >+ \u20ac500 bn\n\n## 2023 BOND FUND INFLOWS\n\nAt a time when interest rates looked set to reach a high for the  period,  boosting  bond  yields  while  limiting  interest  rate risk, bond  fund investors  returned  to  the  market  and reallocated more  than  \u20ac500  billion to  bond  funds  by  endDecember  2023,  corresponding  to  more  than  4%  of  the assets invested in this type of fund at the start of the year. This is in stark contrast to 2022, which ended with an outflow of  over  -\u20ac400 billion from bond funds. At the other end of the spectrum, diversified management seems  to  be continuing  to  bear  the  brunt  of  rising  interest  rates,  with investors  withdrawing  over  -\u20ac330  billion  from  this  type  of fund,  leading  to  an  organic  decline  of  almost  4%  in  this market. Equity  funds have  failed  to  emerge  from  their malaise  despite  the  strong  performance  of  the  equity markets,  barely  managing  to  post  a  very  slight  increase (+\u20ac12 billion  euros )  after  a  flat  2022. Alternative strategies ( hedge funds ) encapsulated in open-ended funds suffered a similar  decline  to  the  previous  year,  with  an  outflow  of around -\u20ac25billion ,  or  more  than  7.9%  of  the  \u20ac315  billion  in assets in this category at the start of the year.\n\nMoney  market  funds fared  well  in  the  high  interest  rate environment, as they did the previous year. This means net inflows  of  around +\u20ac1,400  billion in  2023,  almost  thirteen times the inflow recorded in 2022 (\u20ac110 billion).\n\nInvestor enthusiasm for passive management was once again confirmed  during  the  year.  Net  flows  into  index  funds  and ETFs  totalled  more  than +\u20ac820  billion over  the  period,  a volume  roughly  similar  to  the  previous  year  (around +\u20ac750  billion).  Excluding  money  market  instruments,  the market  share  of  active  management continued  to  fall worldwide, from  67%  to  65% .  This  increase  in  the  market share  of  passive  management  was  evident  in  all  markets (Asia, North America, Europe).\n\nIn  active  management, \"sustainable\"  funds remained  in  the green,  with  net  inflows  of +\u20ac62  billion ,  mainly  due  to  the strong  performance  of  sustainable  money  market  funds (almost  +\u20ac100  billion).  At  the  same  time,  this  is  still  well below the historical net inflow of over +\u20ac500 billion in 2021.\n\n## Global net inflows in 2023 by geographic area (medium- and long-term funds and money market funds)\n\n(In billions of euros)\n\n<!-- image -->",

This  good  and  growing  profitability  results  from  operating performance:\n\n- \u00b7 adjusted net revenues rose  by  2.1%  compared with 2022, to  \u20ac3,204  million,  thanks  to  a  turnaround  in financial revenues (\u20ac80 million vs. -\u20ac48 million in 2022), mainly as a result  of  the  high  yields  offered  by  short-term  rates  in Europe  in  2023  -  rates  which  were  negative  in  2022; Amundi  Technology 's revenues  also  registered  strong growth (+23.6% to \u20ac60 million), thanks to the acquisition of 10 new clients in 2023 and the rise in licence revenues; however, net  management  fees fell  slightly,  registering  a slightly more marked decline that average assets excluding JV, to 0.9% vs. 0.3% respectively; margins on assets under management held up well (17.7 bp over 2023 as a whole vs.  17.8  bp  in  2022  and  17.5  bp  in  2021),  despite  a significant  unfavourable  product  mix  effect  from  the second half of the year, linked to net inflows concentrated in  less  risky  assets;  on  the  other  hand, outperformance fees were down much more sharply, at -27.8% (\u20ac123 million vs.  \u20ac171  million),  reflecting  the  prudent  investment  policy in  risky  assets  and  the  implementation  of  the  ESMA recommendations, which extend the reference periods for calculating outperformance;\n\nAdjusted gross operating income came to \u20ac1,498 million, up 2.2% on 2022.\n\nThe  contribution  to  net  income  from  equity-accounted companies, which reflects Amundi's share in the net income of  the  JVs  in  which  it  has  non-controlling  interests  in  India (SBI  MF),  China  (ABC-CA),  South  Korea  (NH-Amundi),  and Morocco (Wafa Gestion), accentuate this growth, since their contribution, \u20ac102  million, saw strong  growth,  by  15.7% compared to 2022, mainly driven  by  the  JV  in  India  whose contribution amounted to \u20ac79 billion, up 37% versus 2022.\n\nAdjusted net Earnings per Share reached \u20ac6.00 in 2023.\n\n## Accounting data\n\nNet  income,  Group  share  stood  at  \u20ac1,165  million,  taking  into account the amortisation of intangible assets (client contracts related to the acquisition of Lyxor and distribution agreements pertaining to prior transactions), that being -\u20ac59 million after tax for the 2023 year. No integration costs pertaining to Lyxor were recognised during the financial year, versus -\u20ac57 million after tax in 2022.\n\nNet Earnings per Share reached \u20ac5.71.\n\n- \u00b7 adjusted  operating  expenses remained  under  control,  at \u20ac1,706m, an increase of +2.1% compared to 2022, identical to revenue  growth  despite  the  inflationary  context: investments  in  development  were  largely  absorbed  by productivity gains and synergies unlocked by the integration of Lyxor, which have now been almost entirely achieved and will take full effect in 2024 at \u20ac60 million. the adjusted cost-to-income ratio was 53.2% ,  compared with 53.3% in 2022, still at the best level and close to the 2025 target of 53%.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

This subsidiary acts as the  counterparty  for  structured  funds  and  by  hedging  a symmetrical transaction with a market counterparty; as a result, the performance swap outstanding assets recorded as  assets  appear  in  equal  amounts  as  liabilities  on  the Group balance sheet. Netted out, these transactions create no market risk;\n- \u00b7 the  positive  fair  value  of  interest  rate  and  performance swaps entered into as part of structured EMTN issues.\n\nDerivative instruments in liabilities represented \u20ac2,312 million as at 31 December 2023 ( vs. \u20ac2,890 million as at 31 December 2022).\n\nThese  amounts  mainly  reflect  the  negative  fair  value  of derivative  instruments  contracted  as  part  of  the  structured funds or EMTN business and relate to the corresponding asset item, as described above.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\n<!-- image -->",

As  at 31  December  2023,  they  consist  of  \u20ac1,791  million  in  shortterm  deposits  and  cash  and  \u20ac144  million  in  medium-  and long-term loans.\n\nLiabilities at  amortised  cost  consist  of  debts  to  credit institutions and totalled \u20ac1,595 million as at 31 December 2023, compared  to  \u20ac1,427  million  as  at  31  December  2022.  As  at 31 December 2023, debts owed to credit institutions consist of short-term  loans  of  \u20ac245  million  and  medium-  to  long-term loans  of  \u20ac1,350  million,  taken  out  with  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole S.A. group.  This  increase  is  based  on  Amundi's  liquidity  matching policy.\n\nThe subordinated debt item, which totalled \u20ac305 million as at 31 December 2023, is partly made up of the subordinated debt taken out with Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. group as part of the financing of the acquisition of the subsidiaries of the Pioneer Group (maturity 2027). In August 2022, an initial tranche of \u20ac100  million  was  repaid  and  a  new  subordinated  debt  of \u20ac100 million was set up with a 10-year term, due to mature in  2032.  In  August  2023,  a  second  tranche  of  \u20ac100  million euros  was  repaid  and  a  new  subordinated  debt  of \u20ac100 million was established over a period of 10 years, with maturity in 2033.\n\nAccruals and miscellaneous assets amount to \u20ac2,043 million as  at  31  December  2023,  versus  \u20ac2,862  million  as  at 31  December  2022,  down  28.6%;  This  item  records  the collateral  paid  for  Amundi's swap intermediation  activity  for \u20ac204 million (versus \u20ac816 million as at 31 December 2022) and other  accruals  and  miscellaneous  assets  for  \u20ac1,839  million (versus \u20ac2,046 million as at 31 December 2022), in particular net management fees receivable.\n\nAccruals  and  miscellaneous  liabilities amount  to  \u20ac2,975 million as at 31 December 2023, versus \u20ac2,484 million as at 31 December 2022. This item records the collateral received for  the  intermediation  activity  for  \u20ac620  million  (versus \u20ac38 million as at 31 December 2022) and other accruals and miscellaneous liabilities for \u20ac2,354 million (versus \u20ac2,447  million  as  at  31  December  2022),  in  particular retrocession fees payable to distributors.\n\nIntangible  fixed  assets amounted  to  \u20ac385  million  as  at 31 December 2023, versus \u20ac451 million as at 31  December 2022, this variation mainly being explained by the amortisation of the value of distribution contracts in the UniCredit,  BAWAG  and  Banco  Sabadell  networks  and  the value of the client contracts recognised in the context of the acquisition of Lyxor.\n\nGoodwill totalled  \u20ac6,707.7  million  as  at  31  December  2023, compared  to  \u20ac6,731.2  million  as  at  31  December  2022,  this variation being mainly attributable to exchange  rate fluctuations for the period.\n\nGoodwill includes the following main elements:\n\n- \u00b7 \u20ac377.9 million of goodwill recognised upon the transfer by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Indosuez of its asset management business in December 2003;\n- \u00b7 goodwill recognised in 2004 at the time of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole SA's acquisition of Cr\u00e9dit Lyonnais for \u20ac1,732.8 million;\n- \u00b7 \u20ac707.8 million of goodwill related to the transfer of Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale's asset management business in December 2009;\n- \u00b7 goodwill recognised in 2015 at the time of the acquisition of  Bawag  PSK  Invest  (asset  management  company  of Bawag PSK) for \u20ac78.4 million;\n- \u00b7 the goodwill recognised in 2016 following the acquisitions of  KBI  Global  Investors  and  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  Immobilier Investors for a total of \u20ac159.9 million;\n- \u00b7 the goodwill recorded in 2017 following the acquisition of Pioneer Investments for a total of \u20ac2,537.3 million;\n- \u00b7 a  total  of  \u20ac335.0  million  of  goodwill  recognised  in  2020 following the acquisition of Sabadell AM;\n- \u00b7 the goodwill recognised in 2021 following the acquisition of Lyxor for a total of \u20ac652.1 million.",

This  amount  varies depending on the market value of the underlying derivatives.\n- (a) Net cash means asset and liability balances of current accounts with credit institutions, as well as cash and central bank accounts.\n- (h) and (i) Debts to credit institutions carry no surety or guarantees.\n\nFurthermore,  on  28  July  2022,  the  Amundi  Group  renewed the syndicated multi-currency revolving credit agreement of \u20ac1,750  million  with  an  international  syndicate  of  lenders  for an initial term of five years from the signature date, with the option  of  a  two-year  extension.  The  purpose  of  this agreement  is  to  increase  the  Group's  liquidity  profile  in  all foreign  currencies  it  covers.  It  includes  a  mechanism  for indexing  to  ESG  criteria,  particularly  related  to  sustainable development.\n\n## Liquidity ratios\n\nThe  LCR (Liquidity  Coverage  Ratio) ,  Amundi's  one-month liquidity  coverage  ratio  under  stress  was  on  a  12  months average  at  516%  in  2023,  compared  to  525%  for  the year 2022. The objective of the LCR is to promote the shortterm resilience of the liquidity risk profile of credit institutions by  ensuring  that  they  have  a  sufficient  amount  of  high quality liquid assets (HQLA) that are unencumbered and can\n\nbe  easily  and  immediately  converted  into  liquid  assets  on private  markets,  in  the  event  of  a  liquidity  crisis  lasting 30 calendar days. Credit institutions have been subject to a limit  on  this  ratio  since  1  October  2015,  with  a  minimum threshold of 100% from 2018.\n\nThe Net  Stable  Funding  Ratio (NSFR)  is  a  stock  ratio  (the LCR being a  cash-flow  ratio)  that  compares  assets  with  an actual  or  potential  maturity  of  more  than  one  year,  to liabilities  with  an  actual  or  potential  maturity  of  more  than one year. The definition of the NSFR allocates a weighting to each element of the balance sheet (and to certain off-balance sheet  items)  that  reflects  their  potential  to  have  a  maturity greater than one year.\n\nThe Amundi Group is subject to European regulations on this matter  (Regulation  575/2013  as  amended  by  Regulation 2019/876 of 20 May 2019). As such, Amundi must maintain an NSFR ratio of at least 100% from 28 June 2021. Over the first three quarters of 2023, the average NSFR was 115%.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\n<!-- image -->",

The  ongoing  war  in Ukraine has given way to a new conflict in the Middle East, threatening equilibrium in the region. Optimism prevailed on the markets, however, against a backdrop of expectations of rate cuts by the major central banks, particularly the Federal Reserve. The CAC40's performance over the year as a whole bears witness to this: +16.5%.\n\nThe banking and financial world was also turned upside down in 2023: the instability of regional banks in the United States with  the  collapse  of  SVB  proved  contagious,  affecting Europe. This culminated in the collapse of Credit Suisse, one of the historic banks on the closed list of major global banks, and its takeover by UBS.\n\nA  tumultuous  year  which  was  not  reflected  in  the  sector's performance over the year as a whole: the Stoxx Europe 600 Banks  rose  by  20.3%  in  2023  and  the  Stoxx  Europe  600 Financial  Services  26.8%,  with  a  year-end  rally  echoing  this renewed market optimism.\n\nAmundi equity ended the year at \u20ac61.60, up 16.2% compared to end-2022. Amundi took advantage of investors' repositioning in the sector and in equity markets in general to return to trading above the \u20ac60 threshold at the end of the year, after slipping below \u20ac50 in October.\n\nAs of 29 December 2023, the last trading session of the year, the market capitalisation of Amundi was \u20ac12.6 billion. Amundi therefore  retained  its  number  one  position  in  market capitalisation among listed asset managers in Europe.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

In November 2017, the share also  joined  the  MSCI  index  family,  thanks  to  the  improved liquidity resulting from the capital increase of April 2017.\n\nAmundi is also a member of the ESG indices FTSE4Good and Euronext  Vigeo  Eiris,  which  reflects  its  good  CSR  profile (1) (see Chapter 3 of this Universal Registration Document).\n\nAt the end of 2023, Amundi ranked 60th in the SBF120, up three places on the previous year and still within the buffer zone for inclusion in the Next20.\n\n## Relations with shareholders and the financial community\n\nIn  addition  to  the  required  regulated  financial  disclosures, Amundi has,  since  its  listing,  implemented  a  disclosure  and communication  policy  with  the  financial  community  that  is aimed at maintaining a relationship based on trust:\n\n- \u00b7 quarterly  results: Amundi's  Senior  Management  presents the results to the market each quarter, during conference calls, in-person meetings or by videoconference;\n- \u00b7 relations with investors and shareholders: nearly 400  contacts  with  French  and  foreign  institutional investors  take  place,  either  with  Senior  Management  or with  the  Investor  Relations  team,  during  roadshows, sectoral or general conferences;\n\n## 4.5.3 Dividend policy\n\nAmundi  aims  to  distribute  to  its  shareholders  an  annual amount  representing  at  least  65%  of  its  consolidated  net income  Group  share,  before  integration  costs  related  to acquisitions (3) ,  and  before  exceptional  items  not  related  to cash flows (e.g. Affrancamento impact in 2021).\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors  has  decided  to  propose  a  cash dividend  of  \u20ac4.10  per  share  to  the  Annual  General Shareholders' Meeting to be held on 24 May 2024, a stable level  compared  to  the  dividend  per  share  for  the  2022 financial year.\n\n- \u00b7 brokers'  analysts  covering  Amundi's  stock: the  Amundi security as at 31 December 2023 was covered by 18 French and foreign  brokers  with  a  majority  of  a  positive  opinion about the Amundi stock (16 buy rating, and two neutral (2) ). Their  average  price  target  was  \u20ac69.7,  representing  a valuation potential of +13% compared with the price at the end of 2023;\n- \u00b7 the  perception  of  Amundi  by  investors  and  financial analysts  remains  very  positive: the  trajectory  since  the listing has demonstrated the Group's growth capacity and the  resilience  of  its  results,  thanks  to  its  diversified business  model.  In  an  asset  management  sector  facing many  challenges,  Amundi  is  perceived  as  a  solid  player, with significant development prospects.",

Under such a scenario, the Company will inform its shareholders through a press release.\n\nThe  Amundi  General  Shareholders'  Meeting  to  be  held  on 24  May  2024  will  be  asked  to  approve  the  renewal  of  the authorisation  granted  to  the  Board  of  Directors  to  perform transactions  on  Amundi  shares,  which  will  enable  the continued  operation  of  the  share  buyback  programme currently in progress, as described below.\n\n## Information on the use of the buyback programme announced at the General Shareholders' Meeting, in accordance with Article L. 225-211 of the French Commercial Code\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors  informs  the  General  Shareholders' Meeting  of  the  following  information  concerning  the  use  of the share purchase programme for the period from 1 January to 31 December 2023.\n\nDuring  the  financial  year  2023,  the  transactions  carried  out under  the  buyback  programme  were  intended  for  two distinct objectives:\n\n- \u00b7 to  stimulate  the  securities  market  through  a  liquidity agreement concluded with an investment service provider (Kepler  Cheuvreux),  in  accordance  with  the  market practice accepted  by  the  French  Financial  Markets Authority;\n- \u00b7 to cover commitments  made  to  employees  under performance  share  award  plans  in  accordance  with  the provisions of Articles L. 225-197-1 of the French Commercial Code.\n\nThe purchases were made:\n\n- \u00b7 in accordance with the authorisation given to the Board of Directors by the Ordinary General Shareholders' Meeting of Amundi  shareholders  held  on  18  May  2022  (twentieth resolution), until 12 May 2023;\n- \u00b7 afterwards,  in  accordance  with  the  authorisation  granted to  the  Board  of  Directors  by  the  Ordinary  General Shareholders'  Meeting  of  Amundi  shareholders  held  on 12 May 2023 (twenty-first resolution).\n\nAfter obtaining authorisation from the ECB, Amundi launched a  share buyback programme via a mandate concluded with an investment service provider (Kepler Cheuvreux) in order to cover the performance share award plans put in place for the  Group's  key  managers.  This  programme  runs  from 1 August 2022 to 27 September 2022. The number of shares repurchased  amounted  to  1  million  shares,  representing 0.49%  of  the  share  capital  (i.e.,  a  total  amount  of \u20ac50,800,630 on the basis of an average price of \u20ac50.8006). The  Amundi  equity  concerned  is  those  admitted  to  trading on  the  regulated  market  of  Euronext  in  Paris  under ISIN FR0004125920.",

Pursuant to the provisions of Article 241-2 of the AMF General Regulation, the description of this share buyback programme can be found below.\n\n## Number of securities and portion of the share capital directly held by Amundi\n\nAs  at  31  December  2023,  the  number  of  shares  held  directly  by  Amundi  is  1,247,998  shares,  representing  0.61%  of  the  share capital.\n\n## Breakdown of securities held according to objective\n\nAs at 31 December 2023, the shares held by Amundi could be broken down as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 1,188,434 shares intended to cover the commitments to employees under the performance share plan;\n- \u00b7 59,564 shares held under the liquidity agreement for market making purposes.\n\n## Share buyback programme objectives\n\nUnder the share buyback programme that will be submitted to the combined General Shareholders' Meeting of 24 May 2024, the shares may be acquired at any time within the limits permitted by legal or regulatory provisions in force, including  during  takeover  bids  or  public  exchange  offers initiated  by  the  Company  (except  during  a  public  offer targeting the securities of the Company), particularly in view of the following allocations:\n\n- \u00b7 the allocation or sale of shares to employees as part of a profit  sharing  agreement  or  the  implementation  of  any Company  or  Group  savings  plans  (or  a  similar  scheme) under  the  terms  and  conditions  provided  by  law, particularly Articles L. 3332-1 et seq. of the French Labour Code;\n- \u00b7 the  allocation  of  performance  shares  pursuant  to  the provisions of Articles L. 225-197-1 et seq., L. 22-10-59 and L. 22-10-60 of the French Commercial Code;\n- \u00b7 generally, to honour the obligations associated with share allocation programmes for employees or corporate officers of the issuer or an associated company;\n- \u00b7 the distribution of shares at the time of the exercise of the rights  attached  to  securities  giving  access  to  the  capital through reimbursement, conversion, exchange, presentation of a warrant or in any other way;\n- \u00b7 the cancellation of all or of a portion of the securities thus bought back;\n- \u00b7 the  stimulation  of  the  market  for  Amundi  shares  by  an investment services provider under the terms of a liquidity agreement  in  compliance  with  the  Code  of  Conduct recognised  by  the  French  Financial  Markets  Authority (AMF).\n\nThe  goal  of  this  programme  is  also  to  facilitate  the implementation  of  any  market  practice  that  may  be permitted in the future by the AMF, and more generally, the completion of any other transactions that are compliant with regulations in effect. Under such a scenario, the Company will inform its shareholders through a press release.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

It is moreover specified that (i)  the  number  of  shares  acquired  in  view  of  their  retention\n\n## Maximum authorised unit purchase price\n\nThe  maximum  purchase  price  of  the  shares  under  the buyback programme will be \u20ac120 per share (or the exchange value of this amount on the same date in any other currency). It is proposed  that  the  General  Shareholders'  Meeting delegates to the Board of Directors, in the event of a change in  the  par  value  of  the  share,  a  capital  increase  via  the capitalisation  of  reserves,  the  allocation  of  performance\n\nshares, the split or reverse split of securities, the distribution of  reserves  or  any  other  assets,  the  redemption  of  share capital, or any other transaction involving the share capital or equity,  the  power  to  adjust  the  aforementioned  maximum purchase  price  to  take  into  account  the  impact  of  these transactions on the value of the share.\n\n## Duration of the share buyback programme\n\nThe  share  buyback  programme  may  be  implemented  for  a period of 18 months from the General Shareholders' Meeting of 12 May 2023.\n\n## 4.6 OTHER INFORMATION\n\n## 4.6.1 Transactions with related parties\n\nThe  main  transactions  with  related  parties  are  described  in the  summary  consolidated  financial  statements  as  at  31 December 2023 in note 9.2.3 \"Related Parties\" .\n\nIn addition, in accordance with the provisions of Article  L.  225  37-4(2)  of  the  French  Commercial  Code,  the report  on  Corporate  Governance  as  it  will  be  incorporated into  the  2023  universal  registration  document  in  chapter  2 mentions the conclusion of an agreement under the regime of  Article  L.  225-38  of  the  French  Commercial  Code, concluded  during  the  financial  year  2022  and  submitted  to the General Shareholders' Meeting for approval.\n\n## 4.6.2 Main risks and internal control\n\n## 4.6.2.1 Main risks\n\nIn accordance with Article L. 225-100-1, paragraphs 3 and 4, of  the  French  Commercial  Code,  a  description  of  the  main risks  and  uncertainties  facing  the  Company  is  presented  in Chapter 5 of this 2023 Universal Registration Document.\n\nFurthermore,  information  on  financial  risks  arising  from climate  change  and  a  presentation  of  the  measures  the Company is taking (CSR issues, Corporate Social\n\nThe authorisation presented to shareholders at this General Shareholders' Meeting renders ineffective, as of 12 May 2023, up  to  the  portion  not  yet  used,  where  applicable,  any previous delegation given to the Board of Directors to trade in Company shares.\n\nThe special report of the Statutory Auditors dated 31 March 2024,  as  incorporated  into  the  2023  universal  registration document in chapter 8 \"Special auditors' report on regulated agreements\" informs you of the conclusion of this agreement under  Article  L.  225-38  of  the  French  Commercial  Code, describes  its  essential  characteristics  and  terms  and  also recalls the presence of two agreements previously approved during  prior  financial  years  whose  execution  continued during the financial year 2022.\n\nResponsibility)  to  mitigate  these  by  applying  a  low-carbon strategy  are  set  out  in  Chapter  3  of  this  2023  Universal Registration Document.\n\nAs  its  primary  function  is  asset  management,  essentially managing  assets  on  behalf  of  third  parties,  Amundi  is  not directly exposed to the risks associated with climate change.\n\n## 4.6.2.2 Internal control\n\nThe main features of the internal control and risk management procedures put in place by the Company relating to the preparation and processing of accounting and financial information are presented in Chapter 5 of this 2023 Universal Registration Document.\n\nand  subsequent  assignment  under  the  terms  of  a  merger, demerger  or  contribution  may  not  exceed  5%  of  the Company's share capital; and (ii) when the shares are bought back  to  promote  liquidity  under  the  conditions  defined  by the AMF General Regulation, the number of shares taken into account  to  calculate  the  10%  limit  stipulated  above  is  the number  of  shares  purchased,  minus  the  number  of  shares resold during the validity of the authorisation.\n\nThe  overall amount  allocated  to  the  share  buyback programme  cannot  exceed  \u20ac1  billion.

        "page_content": "## 4.7 RECENT EVENTS AND OUTLOOK\n\nAmundi announced on 7 February 2024 that it had signed a binding agreement to acquire Alpha Associates, an independent  asset  manager  offering multi-management investment  solutions  in  private  assets .  This  acquisition  will position  Amundi  as a  leading  European  player  in  the  field , with a team of over 70 experts , assets under management of around \u20ac20 billion , an extended multi-management offering covering  private  debt,  infrastructure, private  equity and venture  capital , and improved  client  and  geographic coverage .  It  will  also  strengthen  Amundi's  positions  in  the secondary market for private assets, at a time when this type of  transaction  is  particularly  relevant  given  the  market conditions.\n\nThis  acquisition  expands  Amundi's  offering  of  tailor-made funds  and  private  asset  solutions  for  its  institutional  clients worldwide.  Lastly,  it  will  accelerate  the  development  of private  asset  investment  solutions  designed  for  individual clients.\n\n## Combining two complementary platforms\n\nFounded in 2004, Alpha Associates is a Zurich-based asset management company run by its  founders.  It  specialises  in multi-management  investment  solutions  for  private  assets and  has  \u20ac8.5  billion  in  assets  under  management.  Alpha Associates provides differentiated fund-of-funds capabilities, notably in private debt, infrastructure and private equity, to over  100  institutional  clients,  including  pension  funds  and insurance companies in Switzerland, Germany and Austria.\n\nThese  capabilities  will  be  combined  with  Amundi's  existing resources,  which  have  more  than  20  years'  experience  in\n\nmulti-management  of  private  assets:  a  dedicated  team  in Paris manages \u20ac12 billion of assets on behalf of institutional clients, mainly in France, Italy and Spain.\n\nAs  a  result  of  this  transaction,  Amundi's  and  Alpha Associates' private asset multi-management activities will be combined into a new business line.\n\n## An expanded offering in a market segment whose growth is supported by long-term trends\n\nPrivate  equity  markets  have  been  among  the  most  dynamic niches in asset management in recent years, as investors seek to  diversify  their  portfolios  and  view  this  asset  class  as  an alternative  offering  attractive  yields  with  moderate  volatility over time.\n\nMulti-management  solutions  are  well-suited  to  support investors on this private asset path, as they provide access to a wide range of management styles and expertise, increasing diversification and improving the risk profile. Multimanagement  investment  solutions  should  also  make  it possible to offer private asset products tailored to individual clients, who currently invest very little in this asset class.\n\n## A transaction creating significant value\n\nThis  transaction,  which  is  in  line  with  Amundi's  financial discipline  and  strategic  plan,  will  create  significant  value through revenue synergies and growth potential. The return on  investment  will  be  above  13%  after  completion  of  the transaction, including revenue synergies.\n\nThe transaction was completed on 2 April 2024.\n\n## 4.8 ANALYSIS OF THE RESULTS OF AMUNDI (PARENT COMPANY)\n\nIn 2023,  the net  banking  income of  Amundi  (parent company) amounted to \u20ac1,198 million compared  to \u20ac968 million in 2022, an increase of \u20ac230 million.\n\nIt mainly consists of:\n\n- \u00b7 revenues on equity securities for \u20ac1,327 million in respect of dividends received from Amundi's subsidiarie;\n- \u00b7 the interest margin for -\u20ac131 million;\n- \u00b7 net income from trading, investment and similar portfolios for +\u20ac5 million.\n\nGeneral operating expenses amounted to \u20ac46 million in 2023.\n\nGiven these elements, gross operating income was \u20ac1,151  million  in  2023,  up  +\u20ac252  million  compared  to  the financial  year  2022.  This  was  mainly  due  to  an  increase  in dividends from equity investments in Group subsidiaries (by +\u20ac413 million), a lower interest margin of -\u20ac116 million and a fall in the market value of the trading, investment and similar portfolios of -\u20ac58 million.\n\nCurrent income before tax amounted to \u20ac1,151 million.\n\nAs part of the tax consolidation agreement, Amundi recorded net income from income tax of \u20ac33 million.\n\nIn  total,  Amundi's net  income was  a  profit  of  \u20ac1,184  million in 2023, versus a profit of \u20ac930 million in 2022.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\n<!-- image -->",

Consequently, risk culture is essential to all of the Company's business lines. Amundi constantly ensures that its organisation and  its  processes  enable  it  to  identify  risks  correctly  and contain  them  at  each  stage  of  its  products'  lives.  This approach is characterised by the sharing of experiences and best  practices  in  terms  of  understanding  and  managing  risk, facilitated by:\n\n- \u00b7 operating across business lines;\n- \u00b7 the  systematic  representation  of  Risk,  Compliance  and Security control functions in the various committees overseeing the activity: products, new activities validation process, investments, ESG, etc.;\n- \u00b7 combining the applications and risk measurement methods onto a single IT platform, creating a set of guidelines shared by all teams;\n- \u00b7 establishing initiatives to discuss and provide information on the various risks related to the Company's business;\n- \u00b7 raising employees' awareness of the emergence of new risks and  the  evolution  of  the  regulations  that  govern  them, through training in an e-learning format.\n\nMaintaining a risk culture also involves educating clients about the risks to which their assets are exposed. Amundi publishes various publications for its clients that describe these risks and their economic evolution, as well as the solutions put in place by the management teams to make the most of them.\n\n## 5.2 RISK FACTORS (AUDITED) (1)(2)\n\nWe present below the main risk factors to  which Amundi is exposed, in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2017/1129.

Amundi's  operational risks  mainly  include  the  risk  of  loss  resulting  from  the inadequacy  or  failure  of  the  processes,  systems  or  persons responsible  for  processing  transactions,  as  well  as  external events,  whether  deliberate,  accidental  or  natural  (floods, fires, earthquakes, terrorist attacks, etc.). Amundi's\n\n## Risks\n\n## Potential consequences\n\n## I. Failure to deliver on promise to clients\n\n- \u00b7 Non-compliance with investment rules.\n- \u00b7 Misalignment of the management with the (implicit or explicit) promise made to the client.\n- \u00b7 Decrease in fund liquidity.\n\n## II. Risk of process malfunction, human error\n\n- \u00b7 Incident resulting from the failure of an operational process.\n- \u00b7 Human error.\n\n## III. Non-compliance, tax, regulatory and legal risk\n\nAmundi's primary business is asset management and,\n\nconsequently, it is governed by the various regulatory frameworks associated with this activity. In addition, in its capacity as a credit institution, Amundi SA (the parent company of the Group) is also subject to the oversight of the banking supervisory authorities. As a consequence, Amundi is exposed to:\n\n- \u00b7 developments and increases in regulatory requirements;\n- \u00b7 regulatory reforms that could have an impact on Amundi's clients (banks, insurance companies or pension funds), encouraging them to review their investment strategies;\n- \u00b7 non-compliance with applicable laws or regulations, or any change in the interpretation or implementation of these.\n\nAs Amundi is regulated as a credit institution, the resolution authorities could open resolution proceedings against it if the Company were to face financial difficulties likely to justify the opening of such proceedings.\n\n## IV. Risk of business interruption\n\n- \u00b7 Unavailability of information systems (loss of hardware, viral attack, destruction of a database, etc.).\n- \u00b7 Unavailability of the working environment (inaccessibility of the site, failure of technical facilities).\n- \u00b7 Unavailability of personnel (public transport strike, epidemic, flood, etc.).\n- \u00b7 Client compensation.\n- \u00b7 Penalty applied by the regulator.\n- \u00b7 Ad hoc support measures.\n- \u00b7 Client compensation.\n- \u00b7 Penalty applied by the regulator.\n- \u00b7 Reputational damage to Amundi.\n- \u00b7 Complying with these requirements is costly and may impact Amundi's growth.\n- \u00b7 Regulatory reforms could impact Amundi's clients and encourage them to review their investment strategies to the detriment of Amundi and/or reduce clients' interest in Amundi's products, resulting in an adverse effect on the assets under management and its results.\n- \u00b7 Non-compliance with laws and regulations may result in sanctions, bans on certain business activities, a loss of clients or other penalties that could have an adverse effect on Amundi's reputation and its earnings, as applicable.\n- \u00b7 Amundi shares could be cancelled or significantly diluted.\n- \u00b7 Inability to carry out market transactions.\n- \u00b7 Potential losses as a result of breaches.\n- \u00b7 Amundi's ability to comply with its regulatory obligations could be impacted.\n- \u00b7 Reputational damage to Amundi.\n- \u00b7 Regulator sanctions or fines.\n\noperational  risks  also  include  the  legal  risk  related  to Amundi's  exposure  to  civil,  administrative  or  criminal proceedings, non-compliance  risk resulting from noncompliance with the regulatory and legislative provisions or ethical standards that govern  its activities, and  the reputational risk that may result.\n\nAs at 31 December 2023, RWAs ( Risk-Weighted Assets )  for operational  risk  amounted  to  \u20ac5.7  billion  for  total  riskweighted assets of \u20ac14.3 billion.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Risk of failure to deliver on promise to clients\n\nThe  risk  associated  with  asset  management  for  third parties arises from  the  misalignment  of  management practices with the (implicit or explicit) promise made to the client.\n\nThe  vast  majority  of  risks  related  to  investments  made  on behalf of third parties are borne by the clients. As such, the main  risk  is  the  liquidity  risk  in  relation  to  the  liabilities  of open-ended funds.\n\nFailure to comply with the investment rules could result in:\n\n- \u00b7 the implementation of support measures in the event of a lack of liquidity on certain asset classes to enable clients to withdraw their investment;\n- \u00b7 having  to  compensate  clients  in  the  event  of  adverse market  developments  as  a  result  of  non-compliance  with investment constraints;\n- \u00b7 a penalty imposed by the regulator.\n\nAs  at  31  December  2023,  risks  related  to  non-compliance with investment rules and misalignment of management with the  (implicit  or  explicit)  promise  made  to  the  client represented 72% of RWA under operational risk.\n\n## II. Risk of process failure, human error\n\nAmundi's communication and information systems, as well as those  of  its  clients,  service  providers  and  counterparties, may be subject to operational failure. It is also impossible to totally exclude the risk of someone making an unintentional error while they are performing a task. The consequences of an  operational  malfunction  or  human  error  vary  depending on  the  type  of  incident.  It  could  involve  having  to compensate  a  client,  being  sanctioned  by  the  regulator, damage to Amundi's reputation, etc.\n\nAs  at  31  December  2023,  risks  related  to  a  failure  of  a business process or human error accounted for 11% of RWAs under operational risk.\n\n## III. Non-compliance, tax, regulatory and legal risk\n\nAmundi  is  an  international  group  operating  in  numerous countries.  Asset  management  is  Amundi's  main  activity, primarily  in  Europe,  with  \u20ac1,524  billion  in  assets  under management as at 31 December 2023 (\u20ac950 billion in France, \u20ac203  billion  in  Italy,  \u20ac372  billion  in  the  rest  of  Europe), \u20ac399  billion  in  Asia,  \u20ac114  billion  in  the  rest  of  the  world. As  their  principal  business  is  asset  management,  the  asset management companies that make up most of the Amundi Group are subject to regulatory and supervisory regimes in each  of  the  countries  in  which  Amundi  operates.  Equally, certain  Amundi  entities,  as  authorised  credit  institution  or investment  companies,  are  subject  to  the  oversight  of  the banking  supervisory  authorities.  Moreover,  as  a  major subsidiary  of  a  banking  group,  the  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  group, Amundi is subject to additional regulatory requirements.\n\nThese  regulations  subject  Amundi's  business  activities  to  a pervasive array of detailed operational requirements. Complying with these requirements is costly and may impact Amundi's growth.\n\nRegulatory  reforms  could  also  affect  some  of  Amundi's clients, such as banking, insurance and pension fund clients, which could cause these clients or distributors to review their investment  strategies  or  allocations  to  the  detriment  of Amundi and/or to reduce their interest in Amundi's products. These  potential  regulatory  reforms  could  therefore  have  a material adverse effect on Amundi's assets under management, earnings and financial position.\n\nNon-compliance  by  Amundi  with  applicable  laws  or regulations, or any  changes  in  the  interpretation  or application  of  these,  could  result  in  the  imposition  of sanctions,  temporary  or  permanent  bans  on  conducting certain business activities, a loss of clients or other penalties that  could  have  an  adverse  effect  on  Amundi's  reputation and, consequently, a material adverse effect on its business and earnings.\n\nAmundi has structured its commercial and financial activities to comply with the tax regulations that apply to it. However, as  it  is  not  always  possible  to  reach  a  clear  and  definitive interpretation of the tax legislation of the various countries in which Amundi entities are located or  operate,  the  Group  is exposed to  tax  risk  and  any  failure  to  comply  with  the  tax legislation of a given country may result in tax reassessments and,  where  applicable,  penalties,  fines  and  interest  on arrears.\n\nIn  addition,  the  tax  legislation  of  the  different  countries  in which  Amundi  entities  are  located  or  operate  is  likely  to change (in particular in the event of changes in the position of the tax authorities and/or the interpretation of the law by a court).\n\nThese  various  risk  factors  may  result  in  an  increase  in Amundi's tax burden and have a material adverse effect on its business, its earnings and its financial position.\n\nAs Amundi is regulated as a credit institution, the resolution authorities  could  initiate  resolution  proceedings  against  it  if the  Company  faced  financial  difficulties  likely  to  justify  the initiation of such proceedings (see 8.5 Regulatory environment), or if the viability of the Company or the Group depended on it. The Company's outstanding shares could be diluted  by  being  converted  into  other  equity  or  debt instruments,  cancelled  or  transferred,  thereby  depriving shareholders  of  their  rights.  Even  before  the  Company's resolution,  if  the  Company's  financial  position  were  to deteriorate significantly, the risk of cancellation or dilution of its  shares  could  have  a  significant  negative  impact  on  their market value.",

        "page_content": "## IV. Risk of business interruption\n\nAmundi's infrastructure - including its technological capacity, data centres, and workspaces -is crucial to the competitiveness of its businesses. A significant proportion of Amundi's  critical  activities  are  concentrated  in  a  limited number  of  geographical  areas,  primarily  Paris,  but  also London,  Milan,  Dublin,  Tokyo,  Hong  Kong,  Singapore  and Boston.  External  events,  whether  deliberate,  accidental  or natural,  could  impact  Amundi's  ability  to  operate.  Such events could include:\n\n- \u00b7 an unavailability of the local work environment caused by site inaccessibility (a building or a group of buildings when these are grouped together) or by failure of the technical facilities (power  outage,  loss  of  access  to  telecom resources, etc.);\n- \u00b7 unavailability  of  staff  caused  by  a  public  transport  strike, an epidemic, a flood, etc.;\n- \u00b7 physical  unavailability  of  information  systems  caused  by the  physical  destruction  of  the  Datacenter's  hardware  or network access resources at the Datacenter;\n- \u00b7 unavailability  of Datacenter software  caused by malicious act,  error  or  accident  (virus  attack,  hacking,  accidental destruction of a database or a database-altering computer bug);\n- \u00b7 widespread  unavailability  of  workstations  caused,  for example, by a massive virus infecting them.\n\n## 5.2.1.2 Activity risk\n\nActivity risk relates to Amundi's strategy, its asset management activities and its competitors.\n\n## Risks\n\n## Potential consequences\n\n## I. Business risks\n\nThe main risks affecting asset management activities are:\n\n- \u00b7 changes in financial markets;\n- \u00b7 Amundi's dependence on the distribution networks of major partner groups such as Cr\u00e9dit Agricole, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale and Unicredit;\n- \u00b7 management fee rates;\n- \u00b7 client demand;\n- \u00b7 Amundi being unable to recruit and retain employees;\n- \u00b7 Amundi's reputation being damaged.\n\n## II. Non-financial risk\n\n- \u00b7 ESG offer not in line with investors' expectations in terms of exemplarity and commitment.\n- \u00b7 Poor marketing practices, contravening the obligations to provide accurate, clear and non-misleading information to assess the proposed ESG approach.\n- \u00b7 Non-compliance of the portfolio or certain securities held therein with the product's ESG characteristics.\n- \u00b7 Drop in the value of assets resulting in a decrease in overall fees.\n- \u00b7 Significant adverse impact on Amundi's assets under management and its net income.\n- \u00b7 Difficulty in achieving outperformance, leading to reduced performance fees.\n- \u00b7 Risk-averse investors in disrupted markets.\n- \u00b7 Loss of clients and reduction in assets under management.\n- \u00b7 Customer disaffection.\n- \u00b7 Reputational damage.\n- \u00b7 Regulator sanction.\n\nRisk factors (audited)\n\nDespite Amundi's efforts to ensure business continuity in the event of such an incident, there could be an adverse impact on  its  ability  to  operate,  which  could  lead  to  a  drop  in  the volume  of  assets  under  management  or  a  reduction  in  its earnings. Such an incident could also impact Amundi's ability to comply with its regulatory obligations, which could affect its  reputation,  or  result  in  regulatory  sanctions  or  fines.  In addition,  a  breakdown  or  failure  of  Amundi's  information systems  could  affect  its  ability  to  determine  or  control  the net asset value of the funds it manages, making it vulnerable to complaints from its clients and harming its reputation.\n\nAmundi  is  exposed  to  cybercrime  targeting  its  clients, suppliers and partners as well as its own infrastructure and IT data.  The  interconnection  between  the  various  market undertakings and the concentration of these increase the risk of an impact on Amundi in the event of an attack targeting one  of  the  links  in  this  chain,  particularly  given  the complexity of the systems that must be coordinated within tight deadlines.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Its  earnings  are  therefore  sensitive  to  factors that impact the performance of its assets:\n\n## \u00b7 The  value  of  financial  instruments  could  be  negative (direct impact on the value of assets under management and indirect impact on net flows).\n\nThe volume of assets under management largely depends on the  value  of  the  assets  held  in  the  funds  and  portfolios managed  by  Amundi,  in  particular  bonds,  equities,  money market products, foreign currencies and real assets.\n\nFluctuations in financial markets, in particular movements in interest rates, credit spreads, foreign exchange rates and the value  of  equities  may  result  in  a  significant  change  in  the value  of  Amundi's  assets  under  management.  Adverse movements  in  the  financial  markets  may  also  reduce  the amount  of new  investment and result in investors withdrawing  assets  from  the  funds  and  portfolios  Amundi manages,  further  impacting  the  volume  of  assets  under management and therefore Amundi's revenue.\n\n## \u00b7 Amundi is dependant upon the distribution networks of its major partners.\n\nAmundi  focuses  on  two  client  segments:  retail  and institutional  investors.  The  retail  investor  segment  includes the  distribution  of  savings  solutions  for  clients  of  partner networks in France and abroad and third party distributors.\n\nIn France, Amundi relies on the networks of banks affiliated with  the  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  and  Soci\u00e9t\u00e9  G\u00e9n\u00e9rale  groups,  with which it has distribution agreements guaranteeing it almost exclusivity  to  distribute  a  significant  part  of  its  products. Products  distributed  in  France  through  these  distribution agreements  represented  \u20ac132  billion in assets under management as at 31 December 2023.\n\nOutside  France,  since  2017,  Amundi  has  had  a  ten-year distribution  agreement  with  the  UniCredit  network  in  Italy, Germany, Austria and Eastern Europe. Amundi also remains the  preferred  supplier  for  the  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  and  Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale  networks  in  Italy  (CA  Italy),  the  Czech  Republic (Komer \u010d ni Banka) and Poland (CA Polska). Amundi is also in partnership with BAWAG P.S.K. in Austria, Resona in Japan and  Banco  Sabadell  in  Spain.  Products  distributed  through partner  distribution  networks  internationally  represented \u20ac162 billion in assets under management as at 31 December 2023. These assets include \u20ac3 billion in assets managed by the subsidiary created at the end of 2020 in China with Bank of China, Amundi Bank of China Wealth Management.\n\nIf  one of these contracts with the partner networks were to terminate  and  not  be  renewed,  Amundi's  assets  under management could be significantly (but gradually) reduced.\n\nThis  distribution  capacity  is  supplemented  by  third-party distributors,  private  banks  and  asset  management  advisors. Products  distributed  through  these  third-party  distributors represented  \u20ac317  billion  in  assets  under  management  by Amundi as at 31 December 2023.\n\nIn  addition,  Amundi  is  a  shareholder  in  joint  ventures  that operate in India, China, South Korea and Morocco. Products distributed through these joint ventures represented \u20ac316 billion in assets under management by Amundi as at 31 December 2023.\n\nThe  distribution  agreements  may  be  terminated  or  not renewed  for  commercial  or  legal  reasons.  Furthermore,  the third-party  distributors  that  distribute  Amundi  products  are not bound by any exclusivity clause. In other words, if a bank that  is  part  of  this  distribution  network  decided  to  replace Amundi's products with those of a competitor, or to reduce the resources dedicated to the promotion and distribution of Amundi's  products,  or  if  it  charged  higher  fees  for  the distribution of Amundi's products, this could adversely affect Amundi's  assets  under  management  and  revenues.  In addition,  factors  affecting  the  competitive  environment  or the reputation of these distribution networks, as well as any potential  default  by  these  entities,  could  have  an  adverse effect on Amundi's reputation and earnings.\n\n## \u00b7 Management fee rates are subject to competitive pressure and market pressure.\n\nAmundi's  management  fees  are  usually  a  percentage  of  its assets under management and vary according to the type of product,  the  geographic  market  and  other  factors.  In  2023, revenues generated by commissions and other income from client activities amounted  to  \u20ac2.94  billion  (excluding performance fees).\n\nFees  are  subject  to  intense  competitive  pressure:  the  fees charged on Retail products must be disclosed in accordance with  the  regulations  in  force,  and  those  charged  to institutional  investors  are  usually  determined  by  a  formal competitive process. The  fees  applied  on  the  asset management  market  have  been  subject  to  significant competitive pressure in recent years. A reduction in the scale of fees would have a direct and adverse effect on Amundi's net income.\n\nIn addition, many competitors offer products that are similar or  comparable  to  those  offered  by  Amundi.  If  competitors' products fail or perform badly, this could result in a loss of confidence  in  Amundi's  similar  products,  regardless  of  how they perform. Any loss of confidence in a given product type could lead to withdrawals, redemptions  and  liquidity problems  for  those  products,  which  could  adversely  affect Amundi,  resulting  in  a  fall  in  its  assets  under  management and reduced earnings.",

        "page_content": "- \u00b7 Demand  from  Amundi's  clients  depends  on  factors  that are beyond its control and have an overall impact on the asset management market.\n\nExternal  factors  such  as  the  macroeconomic,  health  or  tax environment could affect investors' willingness to save and/ or  invest  in  financial  products  and,  consequently,  reduce investors'  interest  in  financial  products  as  a  whole  or  in Amundi  products.  These  changes  could  have  a  significant adverse impact on Amundi's assets under management and its revenue.\n\n- \u00b7 Amundi's  inability  to  recruit  and  retain  its  employees could result in the loss of clients and provoke a drop in its assets under management.\n\nAmundi's success depends on the talent and hard work of its highly qualified employees and on its ability to plan for the Company's long-term future growth, by identifying employees who may ultimately play key roles at Amundi. The market for portfolio managers, investment analysts, product specialists,  sales  staff  and  other  qualified  professionals  is competitive,  and  the  factors  that  affect  Amundi's  ability  to attract  and  retain  these  employees  are,  in  particular,  its reputation,  the  compensation  and  benefits  it  offers,  and  its\n\n## II. Non-financial risk\n\nThe following events could affect Amundi's brand image and reputation and lead to the loss of clients:\n\n- \u00b7 not being aligned with investors' expectations in terms of its ESG offering or corporate social responsibility;\n- \u00b7 poor marketing practices  that  contravene  the  obligations to provide accurate, clear and non-misleading information allowing clients to assess the proposed ESG approach;\n- \u00b7 non-compliance of the portfolio or certain  securities  held therein with the product's ESG characteristics.\n\nAmundi takes steps to meet the expectations of its various stakeholders  in  terms  of  corporate  social  responsibility (CSR).  In  this  regard,  non-financial  risks  are  covered  by policies relating to its operation (Purchasing policies, Human Resources  policies,  etc.)  put  in  place  by  the  businesses  in question.\n\nTo meet investors' expectations in terms of ESG offerings, in 2018  Amundi  announced  its  objective  to  integrate  nonfinancial  criteria  (ESG)  into  its  discretionary  active  asset management  investment  processes.  This  objective  was achieved  in  2021.  In  2022,  new  gfoals  for  2025  were announced in line with investors' expectations.\n\ncommitment  to  the  effective  planning  of  management succession,  including  by  developing  and  training  qualified employees.  If  Amundi  is  unable  to  do  this,  its  ability  to maintain its competitiveness and retain existing clients could be  affected,  and  this  could  result  in  a  reduction  in  assets under management and in its earnings.\n\n- \u00b7 Damage to Amundi's reputation could result in a decrease in  its  assets  under  management,  its  revenue,  and  its earnings.\n\nThe integrity  of  Amundi's  brand  image  and  reputation  is  of crucial importance to its ability to attract and retain clients, commercial  partners  and  employees.  Amundi's  reputation could  be  damaged  by  factors  such  as  poor  investment performance, legal proceedings, action taken by a regulator, misconduct  or  violation  of  applicable  laws  or  regulations. Negative  publicity  in  relation  to  any  of  these  factors  could damage  Amundi's  reputation,  expose  it  to  regulatory sanctions  and  have  an  adverse  impact  on  its  relations  with clients, third-party distributors and other commercial partners. Any damage to Amundi's brand image could have a negative impact on its status within the industry and would result in a loss of business in both the short and long terms.\n\nTo  this  end,  Amundi  has  a  responsible  investment  policy which is revised each year (including in particular the details of  the  ESG  analysis  methodologies  or  its  exclusion  policy). Non-financial  risks  in  portfolios  managed  on  behalf  of  third parties  are  assessed  on  the  basis  of  proprietary  and centralised  ratings,  resulting  from  an  analysis  carried  out according  to  ESG  criteria  by  a  dedicated  team  of  analysts. The  various  parameters  used  for  the  development  of  these ratings are the subject of a specific governance in which the risk control teams participate.\n\nExposure  to  non-financial  risks  is  then  governed  by  limits applicable to all portfolios and/or individually depending on investment strategies.\n\nIn 2023, Amundi has also undertaken the necessary work to meet  the  changes  to  the  SFDR  regulation  (Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation) (see Chapter 3 for the details of the provisions adopted by Amundi in terms of corporate social responsibility and responsible investment).\n\nAmundi has also strengthened and expanded its approach to integrate  the  identification  and  assessment  of  sustainability risks, including physical and transition climate risks.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Default risk\n\nAmundi is exposed to default risk on its investment portfolio as well as through guarantees given on some of the products it  offers  to  clients.  If  the  issuers  of  securities  held  by  these funds and/or their contractual counterparties were to fail or become subject to insolvency or similar proceedings, Amundi would  be  required  to  replace  the  relevant  assets  and perform its obligations as guarantor, which could result in a significant  loss.  This  risk  is  monitored  continuously  by  the Credit  Analysis  team  of  the  Risk  Management  Department which alerts the Credit Committee if the financial condition of an issuer or counterparty deteriorates. The Credit Committee sets the individual limits on issuer risk for securities  held  directly  or  by  the  guaranteed  funds.  It  also sets the counterparty risk limits on market transactions.\n\nStructured  funds  benefiting  from  guarantees  granted  by Amundi  mainly  consist  of  three  types:  structured  funds, constant  proportion  portfolio  insurance  (CPPI)  funds  and Italian pension funds.\n\nStructured funds are  intended to deliver a predefined yield, based on a formula that is usually linked to share prices or indexes.  The  formula  usually  includes  a  form  of  capital protection.\n\nCPPI  funds are  intended  to  offer  partial  exposure  to  the returns  of  higher-risk  assets,  along  with  a  guarantee  that  is defined at the outset.\n\nGuaranteed  mandates  for  Italian  pension  fund  clients are designed  to  protect  the  capital of subscribers until retirement age (except in the case of early exit).\n\nThe following table shows amounts guaranteed as at 31 December 2023 and 31 December 2022:\n\n| (in \u20ac millions)                                      | 31/12/2023   | 31/12/2022   |\n|------------------------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Structured funds                                     | 6,715        | 4,712        |\n| Constant proportion portfolio insurance (CPPI) funds | 2,615        | 4,398        |\n| Italian guaranteed mandates                          | 1,543        | 2,679        |\n| Other guarantees                                     | 2,274        | 1,125        |\n| TOTAL OFF-BALANCE SHEET COMMITMENTS                  | 13,147       | 12,914       |",

As  at  31 December  2023,  the  total  nominal  amount  of  transactions concluded between  Amundi  Finance  and  its  market counterparties was \u20ac40.1 billion.\n\nOnce the funds and the EMTNs  have  been  sold, the  transactions  are  hedged  so  as  to  only  create  limited market  risk.  However,  they  do  result  in  liquidity  and counterparty risk.\n\nThe notional amount of the performance swaps on funds and EMTNs being marketed as at 31  December  2023  was  \u20ac548 million  compared  to  \u20ac804  million  at  31  December  2022. Performance swaps are written with market counterparties in a  notional  amount  equal  to  the  projected  level  of  sales. The  fund  is  committed  only  to  the  actual  level  of  sales. Amundi bears the risk of a variance between the projected level  of  sales  and  the  actual  level.  These  are  short-term liabilities  (average  marketing  time  is  three  months).  A provision appraised by experts is recognised on the closing date  should  there  be  a  variance  in  current  transactions between the projected level of sales and the actual level. No provision had been made as at 31 December 2023.\n\nRisk factors (audited)\n\nExcept for the Italian guaranteed mandates, the main risk to which the guarantor is exposed in relation to these funds is the risk of default on securities acquired directly by the fund.\n\nAssets  that  expose  the  guarantor  to  credit  risk  are permanently  monitored  by  an  independent  credit  analysis team within the Risk Management Department. Exposures for each issuer are subject to limits set by the Credit Committee. Exposures  are  monitored  on  the  basis  of  their  nominal amount. The credit quality measurement process includes an internal system that gives a ranking based on issuer quality.\n\nAssets exposing the guarantor to credit risk are subject to:\n\n- \u00b7 prior authorisation of each investment from the independent  credit  analysis  team.  The  exposure  for  each issuer  has  limits  placed  upon  it.  There  is  no  sector  or geographic restriction a priori but the assets must be rated at least investment grade at the time they are acquired;\n- \u00b7 monthly reports in terms of exposure, limits and ratings.\n\nTo reduce the funds' counterparty risk associated with these transactions  -  to  which  Amundi  is  exposed  as  guarantor  Amundi  deals  with  the  counterparties  on  its  own  account. These  are  all  large  financial  institutions.  These  transactions are  centralised  by  Amundi  Finance,  an  Amundi  subsidiary that specialises in guarantee activity. Counterparties used for derivatives  brokerage  are  pre-authorised  by  the  Credit Committee which sets the limits of separate exposures. The transactions  are  executed  under  master  agreements  with exchange of collateral, which substantially reduces Amundi's counterparty risk.\n\nAlthough transactions are executed under master agreements  with  exchange  of  collateral  in  order  to  reduce Amundi's counterparty risk,  Amundi may nevertheless incur significant losses in the event of default by major counterparties. In the event that one or more of the financial institutions defaults, Amundi should complete these transactions and seek other counterparties in order to enter into  new  transactions.  In  addition,  Amundi's  credit  risk  may be amplified if the collateral held by Amundi cannot be sold or is liquidated at a price that is not sufficient to recover the amount  owed  to  Amundi  as  a  result  of  its  exposure  to derivatives.\n\n## III. Equity investment risk\n\nWhen it makes strategic equity investments in the share capital of a company, Amundi's degree of control may be limited and any disagreement with other shareholders or with the management of the entity concerned could have an adverse impact on Amundi's ability to influence the policies of that entity. Amundi is exposed to the risk that the value of the capital securities it holds could fall.\n\nInterests in equity-accounted entities amounted to \u20ac498 million as at 31 December 2023.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Risk of price fluctuations in the investment portfolio\n\nThe  investment  portfolio  includes  surplus  capital  voluntary investments and seed money . Seed money is used to launch new funds. Portfolios mainly consist of investments in funds managed by Amundi and its subsidiaries.\n\nThe investment portfolio is supervised by:\n\n- \u00b7 the Seed  Money  Committee , which  meets  monthly  to validate and  monitor  Seed  Money  investments  and divestments;\n- \u00b7 the Financial Management Committee, which meets up to twice per quarter and establishes guidelines pertaining to the  voluntary  investments  portfolio  and  ensures  the monitoring of the risk structure of the investment portfolio; overall portfolio investment limits as well as limits for each underlying  asset  are  set  by  the  Risk  Management Department annually.\n\nFor  most  French  entities,  day-to-day  cash  management (relating  to  the  Company's  operations)  is  governed  by  a centralised  cash  management  agreement.  The  voluntary investment and seed money portfolios are largely managed centrally at Group level.\n\n## II. Foreign exchange risk\n\nAmundi's  primary  exposure  to  foreign  exchange  risk  is structural,  related  to  its  investments  in  foreign  subsidiaries and  joint  ventures.  Amundi's  policy  is  not  to  systematically hedge all of these exposures, but rather to hedge the most significant exposures so as to optimise hedging costs in line with  the  impact  of  this  risk  on  the  Common  Equity  Tier  1 (CET1) solvency ratio. These hedges amounted to \u20ac66 million as at 31 December 2023.\n\nThe  investment  portfolio  is  principally  divided  into  fixedincome  and  money  market  exposures  as  detailed  in  table 4.4.1.2 of this Universal Registration Document.\n\nFluctuations in the financial markets, particularly movements in interest rates, issuer credit spreads, foreign currencies and the value of equities may lead to significant variations in the value of Amundi's own investments and affect its net revenue and/or  capital.  Market  risk  is  measured  by  a  variety  of indicators, including Value at Risk (VaR), a statistical measure used  to  estimate  the  financial  risk  level  of  an  investment portfolio.  VaR  represents  the  potential  loss  over  a  given holding period at a given confidence level. Amundi's VaR is a historical  VaR.  Amundi  measures  VaR  at  a  99%  confidence level  and  a  20-day  holding  period,  based  on  a  historical observation period of one year. It amounted to \u20ac27.9 million as at 31 December 2023.\n\nOperational  foreign  exchange  positions  are  subject  to  an overall  limit  requiring  the  routine  conversion  of  revenue received in foreign currencies into euros and the hedging of any  investments  made  in  foreign  currencies  as  part  of  the investment portfolio. This limit ensures that Amundi does not have significant operational foreign exchange exposure.\n\nAlthough  Amundi's  currency  positions  are  not  significant, exchange  rate  fluctuations  could  affect  Amundi's  earnings and financial position.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Real estate risk\n\nSince the end of 2013, Amundi has developed a business in issuing index-linked bonds:\n\n- \u00b7 bonds  whose  structure  is  linked  to  the  equity  markets: these issues are hedged by derivatives and pose no market risk for Amundi;\n- \u00b7 bonds whose structure is benchmarked in part to the real estate  market:  these  issues  are  hedged  using  the  same principles as equity-linked issues, but they expose Amundi to the risk of changes in real estate prices, because of the capital guarantee attached to them. This type of risk has its own set of restrictions.\n\nAmundi  invests  a  proportion  of  the  income  from  these securities  in  units  of  real  estate  investment  funds  managed by one of its entities. These securities expose Amundi to real estate risk, given that it is usually obliged to pay the principal of the securities on maturity, irrespective of the performance of the underlying real estate investment funds.\n\nTo a lesser extent, Amundi may be exposed to liquidity risk, as  it  may  be  unable  to  sell  shares/units  of  the  underlying funds  sufficiently  quickly  to  generate  the  liquid  assets required  to  meet  redemption  requests,  particularly  in  times of market disruption.\n\nAs at 31 December 2023, the nominal amount of structured securities issues amounted to \u20ac16,236 million, including \u20ac985 million in bonds that were partly indexed to real estate.\n\n## 5.3 RISK MANAGEMENT SYSTEM\n\n## 5.3.1 Internal control and risk management system\n\nAmundi's internal control system notably complies with the provisions  of  the  French  Monetary  and  Financial  Code (Article L. 511-41), the Order of 3 November 2014 concerning the  internal  control  of  companies  in  the  banking,  payment services and investment services sector, which are subject to regulation  by  the  French  Prudential  Supervisory  Authority (Autorit\u00e9 de Contr\u00f4le Prudentiel et de R\u00e9solution, ACPR), the AMF  General  Regulation  and  guidelines  on  corporate governance,  particularly  those  issued  by  the  European Banking Authority and the Basel Committee.\n\nThe structure of the internal control system also consistently conforms to the guidelines laid down by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. and the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole group, which are aimed at ensuring a consolidated approach to risk as part of the controls carried out  by  the  Group,  the  majority  shareholder.  These  external guidelines  are  supplemented  by  Amundi's  own  charters, standards  and  internal  procedures  in  the  areas  of  risk monitoring, including IT and accounting, compliance checks and internal audit.\n\n## 5.3.1.1 Fundamental principles\n\nAmundi's  internal  control  system  is  based  on  the  following fundamental principles:\n\n- \u00b7 systematic reporting to the Board of Directors in relation to the risk management framework, the monitoring of set limits, the activities and results of audits carried out by the various  parts  of  the  internal  control  system,  as  well  as significant incidents;\n- \u00b7 direct involvement of Senior Management in the organisation and functioning of the internal control system;\n- \u00b7 comprehensive hedging of activities and risk;\n- \u00b7 clear  definition  of  responsibilities,  through  a  system  of formal, up-to-date delegations;\n- \u00b7 effective  segregation  of  the  commitment  and  control functions.\n\nThe  internal  control  system  applies  equally  to  all  Amundi Group  entities  and  covers  the  management  and  control  of activities, as well as the measurement and monitoring of risk. The  system  implemented  by  Amundi  is  customised  and adapted to suit the various operational units and subsidiaries depending  on  their  specialist  areas,  and  particularly  with regard to their regulatory obligations.\n\nThe Board of Directors defines the risk  appetite  framework and the risk limits that apply to the Group. The governance of the  internal  control  system  stipulates  that  the  Board  of Directors'  Risk  Management  Committee  is  to  systematically report back the results of controls and significant incidents in light of this framework.\n\nThe  resources,  tools  and  reports  used  in  this  regulatory environment mean that Senior Management and the Board of Directors can be given regular reports on the functioning of the internal control system and its adequacy with regard to the Group's risk profile.\n\nThe design of the internal control system relies on two main cornerstones:\n\n- \u00b7 systems  for  the  measurement,  monitoring  and  control  of risk: financial risk, operational risk (operational processing, accounting and financial information, information systems), legal risk and non-compliance risk;\n- \u00b7 Level  1  Permanent  Control  system  is  carried  out  by  the operational units, Level 2 Permanent Control is ensured by the Risk, Compliance, and Security functions and periodic controls are performed by Internal Audit.\n\nAmundi's  internal  control  system  covers  all  of  the  Group within  France  and  internationally,  except  for  the  joint ventures in which Amundi holds a minority interest.",

It is implemented by all operational units  under  their  hierarchy.  Level  1  Permanent  Control  is designed  to  ensure  compliance  with  internal  procedures relating  to  the  operational  processes,  and  their  compliance with current laws and regulations, professional standards and codes of conduct. It makes it possible to prevent or detect any risk arising as a result of Amundi's activities.\n\nThe  executives  of  the  operational  units  are  individually responsible  for  managing  the  risk  associated  with  their activities.  They  are  responsible  for  the  definition,  efficient deployment and regular updating of the Permanent Control system within their units.\n\nThe  control  system  takes  into  account  the  regulatory framework  and  internal  procedures.It  is  understood  that these procedures must evolve and be adapted to our clients' expectations.  They  must  take  into  account  improvements that  are  expected  in  relation  to  any  actual  or  potential incidents, as well as the recommendations made by Internal Audit.\n\nThe  operational  units  obtain  the  resources  necessary  to perform  these  controls  and  regularly  communicate  the results  to  the  Department  to  which  they  report,  the  Risk Management Department, the Compliance Department, and the Security Department.\n\nThey prepare reports for the attention of their supervisors at least  once  a  year,  including  a  list  of  the  key  indicators  and controls implemented to manage the risks to which they are exposed, as well as a summary of the results of the controls carried out.\n\nIn  the  event  of  the  significant  deterioration  of  a  risk,  the operational units alert  their  hierarchy  without  delay,  as  well as the control functions.\n\nThe  quality  and  relevance  of  the  Level  1  controls  and  the effective  feedback  of  their  results  for  Level  2  control functions  is  an  essential  factor  in  the  efficiency  of  Level  2 controls.\n\n## Level 2 Permanent Control\n\nLevel  2  Permanent  Control  is  performed  jointly  by  three control functions, which are independent from the operational units:\n\n- \u00b7 the Risk Management function;\n- \u00b7 the Compliance function;\n- \u00b7 the Security function.\n\nCollectively,  these  three  functions  are  responsible  for  the cooperative  and  coordinated  management  of  the  entire Permanent  Control  system  to  verify  that  it  provides comprehensive  hedging  of  the  risks  Amundi  is  exposed  to. They report to the Head of the Strategy, Finance and Control Division.\n\n## Coordination within Amundi as a whole\n\nAmundi's  Risk  Management,  Compliance,  and  Security Departments  are  responsible  for  the  overall  steering  of  the Permanent Control system of the Amundi Group. Accordingly,  they  define  the  approach  and  principles  for implementation  within  the  Group's  various  entities.  They coordinate  the  control  plans  and  organise  the  reporting  of the findings.\n\nThe  Risk  Management,  Compliance,  and  Security  functions act  in  a  collective  and  complementary  manner  in  their respective fields of competence by ensuring the consistency and  effectiveness  of  the  controls  carried  out  by  the operational departments.\n\nThe  Risk  Management,  Compliance,  and  Security  functions take  into  account  the  Level  1  controls  implemented  by  the business  lines  and  the  resulting  reports  relayed  when defining  their  own  Level  2  controls.  The  frequency  and comprehensiveness of these Level 2 controls depend on the annual risk assessment and mapping exercise carried out by each of the three functions.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

It ensures that  the  internal  control  system  is  subject  to  constant monitoring  to  verify  its  adequacy  and  effectiveness.  Senior Management is informed of the main malfunctions identified and the corrective measures applied.\n\n## Consolidated performance indicators for the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole group\n\nThe  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  group  has  established  a  set  of  key indicators  (consolidated  Level  2  controls,  classified  as  2.2c controls) in various fields, which include: credit risk, financial risks, accounting risk, non-compliance risk, business continuity  plan,  security,  safety  prevention,  IT  risk,  and operational risk.\n\nAn  individual  responsible  for  each  category  is  appointed within Amundi to establish the relevant indicators using the 2.2c  indicators  proposed  by  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  S.A.  as  a methodological  benchmark.  This  is  done  for  all  Amundi Group  entities.  This  individual  retains  the  audit  trail  of  the controls completed and the results obtained.\n\nAmundi's  Risk  Management  Department  is  in  charge  of coordinating the collection and consolidation of the results of controls  carried  out  based  on  indicators  defined  by  the individuals  responsible  for  each  category  on  behalf  of Amundi, and providing them to the Group's Internal Control Committee.\n\n## Level 3 controls\n\nAmundi's Internal Audit is in charge of the Group's periodic control; it ensures the lawfulness, security and effectiveness of all operations and risk control activities across all Amundi entities. It intervenes via audit plans approved by the Board of  Directors'  Risk  Management  Committee  to  cover  the activities  at  frequencies  appropriate  to  the  risks  of  each activity. Each audit results in a report and recommendations, to which  the  audited  entities  respond.  The  effective implementation  of  recommendations  is  monitored  twice yearly by Amundi's Internal Audit. The General Internal Audit Department of  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  S.A.  also  conducts  audits  of the Amundi Group.\n\nThe Board of Directors:\n\n- \u00b7 on the recommendation of Senior Management, approves the risk appetite in view of the Group's defined strategy;\n- \u00b7 is informed at least twice a year, through presentations by Senior  Management,  about  the  Group's  consolidated  risk situation  and  earnings,  the  status  of  the  risk  monitoring and  internal  control  system  and  the  earnings  from operations and the internal control findings.\n\nIn addition, the Board of Directors is informed of significant incidents that exceed certain thresholds which are reviewed annually by the Risk Management Committee of the Board of Directors.  Lastly,  it  reviews  the  annual  report  on  internal control once a year.",

Other members of this committee include Amundi's Head  of  Risk  Management,  Head  of  Compliance,  Head  of Security, Head of Legal Affairs and Head of Internal Audit. It meets 11 times a year.\n\nThe duties of the Committee include:\n\n- \u00b7 assessing  the  internal  control  system  and  the  control system implemented;\n- \u00b7 examining the major risks of any kind to which Amundi is exposed  and  changes  to  the  risk  and  performance measurement systems, and ensuring the adequacy of the internal control system to correctly oversee these risks;\n- \u00b7 making  any  decision  necessary  to  remedy  weaknesses  in the internal control system;\n- \u00b7 monitoring the implementation of commitments made as a consequence of internal and external audits;\n- \u00b7 deciding on corrective measures for shortcomings revealed  by  the  audits  as  well  as  by  the  operating  and control  reports  available  to  those  responsible  for  the control or management functions of the entity.\n\n## Risk Management Committee\n\nAmundi's  Group  Risk  Management  Committee,  chaired  by the  Deputy  Chief  Executive  Officer,  Head  of  the  Strategy, Finance  and  Control  Division,  is  the  main  risk  governance body. It meets 11 times a year.\n\nThe  objectives  of  the  Committee  are  to  set  the  risk management  policy  governing  all  Amundi  Group  entities (risks  taken  on  behalf  of  third  parties  and  on  its  own account). Accordingly, it has complete authority to:\n\n- \u00b7 define Amundi's risk policy;\n- \u00b7 approve management strategies and investment processes;\n- \u00b7 approve methodologies used to calculate risk indicators;\n- \u00b7 approve credit and counterparty limits;\n- \u00b7 set overall limits;\n- \u00b7 make  decisions  about  the  funds'  use  of  new  financial instruments;\n- \u00b7 determine  the  risk  framework  for  each  product  and activity;\n- \u00b7 review the findings of controls performed;\n- \u00b7 make  the  decisions  necessary  to  resolve  any  exceptions discovered.\n\nDecisions made by the Group Risk Management Committee apply to all Group entities.\n\nThe  Group  Risk  Committee  delegates  the  specific  duties entrusted to it to several sub-committees. Thus:\n\n- \u00b7 the Valuation Committee sets the valuation policy;\n- \u00b7 the  Credit  Committee  approves  the  per  issuer  limits  on supervised funds and own account and counterparty limits on all funds;\n- \u00b7 the Operational Risk Management Committee handles the monitoring  of  incidents  related  to  operational  processes and defines the measures to enhance these processes.\n\nThe  Risk  Management  Committees  of  Amundi  subsidiaries, chaired  by  the  local  Chief  Executive  Officer,  have  the authority  to  adapt  the  policy  framework  applicable  to investments  to  particular local regulations or market conditions,  though  always  complying  with  the  decisions  of the  Group  Risk  Management  Committee.  These  committees meet at least quarterly.\n\n## Compliance Committee\n\nAmundi's  Compliance  Committee,  chaired  by  the  Deputy Chief  Executive  Officer,  Head  of  the  Strategy,  Finance  and Control Division, meets 11 times a year. Amundi's Compliance Committee  is  an  operational  committee  responsible  for overseeing  the  implementation  and  application  of  the Compliance  control  program  for  Amundi  and  the  entities falling  within  the  scope  of  its  internal  control  system.  As such, the Compliance Committee:\n\n- \u00b7 defines and approves the Group's Compliance policy;\n- \u00b7 receives  reports  of  any  significant  information  regarding any  incidents  arising  from  the  application  of  French  or foreign legislation and regulations;\n- \u00b7 oversees  the  Group's  non-compliance  risk  management system and ensures it is relevant and effective;\n- \u00b7 approves  the  non-compliance  risk  mapping  and  the Compliance control plan, which are reviewed each year;\n- \u00b7 examines  the  results  of  controls,  dashboards  and  other indicators submitted by the entities;\n- \u00b7 monitors cases submitted by the entities;\n- \u00b7 monitors significant malfunctions of which it is aware and the  related  corrective  measures,  and  takes  all  decisions and provides all additional instructions regarding measures to be taken to correct malfunctions;\n- \u00b7 oversees  the  results  of  Compliance  Committees  for Amundi subsidiaries.\n\nAt  least  twice  a  year,  Amundi's  Compliance  Committee  will submit  to  its  Board  of  Directors  a  report  containing information regarding any incidents arising from  the application of French or foreign legislation and regulations.\n\n## Security Committee\n\nThe Security Committee, chaired by Amundi's Deputy Chief Executive  Officer  in  charge  of  the  Strategy,  Finance  and Control Division, oversees the security of goods and people, the  security  of  information  systems,  the  business  continuity plan (including resilience in the face of a major IT attack) and crisis  management,  as  well  as  the  protection  of  personal data.

These measures form an integral  part  of  the  internal  control  system.  The  scope covered  includes  operational  risk,  market  risk,  credit  and counterparty risk, legal risk, etc.\n\nAmundi  has  put  in  place  an  organisation  to  manage  risk which  is  based  on  a  high  level  of  integration  of  the  Risk Management business  line  across  the  whole  of  the  Amundi Group, with the following objectives:\n\n- \u00b7 uniformity of the risk monitoring processes;\n- \u00b7 pooling of resources adapted to suit the various entities;\n- \u00b7 high  level  of  team  expertise,  by  means  of  dedicated centres of competence.\n\n## 5.3.3.1.1 Organisation of the Risk Management business line\n\nThe  Risk  management  business  line  employs  a  matrix organisation consisting of:\n\n- \u00b7 cross-business Risk Management divisions, which determine the broad methods of controlling and monitoring risk related to the way funds are managed and provide  supervision  of  this  risk.  The  goal  of  these departments  is  to  integrate  all  risk  and  performance factors  and  indicators  for  each  fund  analysed  and  to ensure  the  internal  consistency  of  these  indicators  and their  suitability  to  a  fund's  objectives.  Within  these divisions, Senior Risk Managers (SRM) consult with Senior Investment  Managers  to  oversee  the  risks  of  each  asset class managed;\n- \u00b7 in  each  subsidiary  that  manages  assets,  a  Risk  team oversees the risks and reports functionally to a department head;\n- \u00b7 teams  specialised  by  field  of  expertise  and  brought together  in  a  dedicated  department  whose  mission  is  to\n\nensure  consistency  across  business  lines  of  the  approach taken  for  each  type  of  risk.  The  main  missions  of  this department are to define the standards and methods for measuring  risk,  produce  the  risk  indicators  and  provide expertise in applying these measurements to the portfolios;\n\n- \u00b7 the  department  is  organised  around  the  following  seven areas of expertise:\n- \u00b7 implementation  and  administration  of  the  monitoring software for regulatory and contractual constraints,\n- \u00b7 measurement and attribution of performance,\n- \u00b7 calculation of credit and market  risk indicators, definition and control of the valuation policy,\n- \u00b7 supervision of the monitoring system for operational risk and accounting risk, as well as coordination of the work done on permanent control at consolidated level,\n- \u00b7 establishment of a list of authorised counterparties and, for  certain  managed  portfolios,  the  setting  of  issuer limits,\n- \u00b7 the  steering  and  implementation  of  solutions  for  the Risk Management  department  and  cross-business projects,\n- \u00b7 establishment of a list  of  authorised  counterparties  for all  managed  portfolios  and  the  setting  of  per  issuer limits for certain managed portfolios;\n- \u00b7 a dedicated team in charge of steering the operational risk monitoring system. This team's main role is to:\n- \u00b7 map operational risk at the Amundi level,\n- \u00b7 collect information about operational incidents,\n- \u00b7 monitor all action plans designed to mitigate this risk,\n- \u00b7 contribute to calculating the capital requirement,\n- \u00b7 contribute to the Permanent Control system.\n- \u00b7 the Financial Management Committee, which analyses the financial risk borne by the Group (such as liquidity, foreign exchange and overall interest rate) and makes any decision to  optimise  the  structure  of  the  balance  sheet  and  limit the financial risk directly borne by the Group.",

All  teams  and  managers  are  involved  in managing operational risk.\n\nTo make  risk monitoring more consistent, the risk management  information  system  is  shared  by  all  entities within  the  internal  control  scope,  including  the  following tools:\n\n- \u00b7 applications for managing constraints and risk limitations;\n- \u00b7 applications for measuring market risk;\n- \u00b7 systems for performance measurement and attribution.\n\nPeriodic reports are provided to Senior Management and to the Board of Directors on the controls carried out by the Risk Management  function.  In  2023,  Senior  Management  was regularly updated by:\n\n- \u00b7 the Risk Management function's Monthly Scorecard, which provides  a  detailed  review  of  the  Group's  exposure  to various risks, and sensitive matters;\n- \u00b7 the update given by the Head of Risk Management to the Executive Committee; and\n- \u00b7 the  Risk  Management  business  line's  various  governance committees  which  Senior  Management  takes  part  in, including  Amundi's  Group  Risk  Management  Committee which  is  the  head  committee  of  the  Risk  Management system.\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors  also  receives  regular  information through  presentations  given  by  the  Risk  Management Committee  of  the  Board  of  Directors  at  meetings,  which cover:\n\n- \u00b7 the  risk  management  system,  its  current  state  and  any changes to it;\n- \u00b7 a summary of risks, changes in risk, the level of the main risk limits and usage of those limits.\n\n## 5.3.3.2 Compliance function\n\n## 5.3.3.2.1 Organisation of the Compliance business line\n\nAmundi's  Compliance  business  line  is  organised  as  a centralised  function  that  is  independent  of  operational services.  The  duties  of  Amundi's  Head  of  Compliance  are carried out totally independently. A feature of this independence is a dual reporting system; reporting hierarchically, on the one hand, to the Head of Compliance of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole and operationally, on the other, to Amundi's Deputy  Chief  Executive  Officer,  Head  of  the  Strategy, Finance and Control Division.\n\nThe  Compliance  Business  Line  ensures  that  the  prevention and  control  systems  for  non-compliance  risk  are  consistent and effective throughout the entities that are monitored on a consolidated basis by Amundi.  Along  with  the  Risk Management  and  Security  business  lines,  it  constitutes  the second line of defence of the Group's internal control system. The  Compliance  business  line  relies  on  the  controls formalised by the managers of the operational units, who are primarily responsible for and the guarantors of the effective deployment  of  the  internal  control  system  and  ensure  that the transactions carried out comply with laws and regulations and internal standards.\n\n## 5.3.3.1.2 Improvement and adaptation of the risk monitoring system in 2023\n\nThe principal changes to the risk monitoring system in 2023 involved  continuing  the  work  initiated  in  previous  years  on liquidity  risk,  particularly  with  regard  to  ESMA  regulations, and supporting the roll-out of the ESG approach.\n\n- \u00b7 Managing and monitoring liquidity risk:\n- \u00b7 hedging  of  missing  category  of  instrument  (collateral, internal mutual funds, etc.),\n- \u00b7 methodological  refinement  of  GIC  liquidity  buffers,  by redefining  liquid  assets  (dynamic  approach  based  on unit liquidation costs and average daily volumes (ADV) for  equities),  and  review  of  the  target  size  of  these buffers,  based  on  observed  historical  redemptions.  All categories have been migrated except for securitisations  and  funds  of  funds  (as  part  of  a continuous improvement process),\n- \u00b7 introduction  of  swing  pricing  and  Gate  mechanisms  in line with changes in regulatory doctrine (AMF, BaFin);\n- \u00b7 supporting the roll-out of the ESG approach:\n- \u00b7 continued  operational  roll-out  of  controls  on  ESG  and sustainable  investment  obligations,  in  particular  the implementation of the SFDR regulation to monitor ESG coverage rates and the minimum  weighting of sustainable assets specified in the legal documentation (Pre-contractual Document),\n- \u00b7 updating  the  ESG  risk  management  policy  in  response to these developments.\n\nIts main tasks are:\n\n- \u00b7 to disseminate a culture of compliance within the Group;\n- \u00b7 to define the framework of compliance standards;\n- \u00b7 to  assist  the  Group's  managers  and  employees  with carrying out their business activities;\n- \u00b7 to help the business lines assess non-compliance risk and implement and monitor the corresponding controls;\n- \u00b7 to  represent  the  Group  in  its  dealings  with  regulators, national authorities and  professional associations in conjunction with the Group's other control functions;\n- \u00b7 to inform and, if applicable, warn Senior Management of a non-compliance risk.\n\nAmundi's Compliance business line which is structured as a globally  integrated  function,  brings  together  all  of  the Compliance teams of Amundi and its subsidiaries. It is itself incorporated  into  the  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  group's  Compliance business  line.  Its  structure  is  designed  to  preserve  the independence  of  the  entities'  Compliance  Managers,  to ensure  that  the  resources  allocated  to  the  effective management  and  control  of  non-compliance  risk  are adequate  and  proportionate  and  to  ensure  information  is transparent.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Every year, the Compliance Department of each entity and subsidiary:\n\n- \u00b7 maps  the  risk  of  non-compliance  with  legislative  and regulatory  provisions  with  the  aim  of  identifying  major areas of risk and determining the regulatory procedures to be put in place and setting out any remedial action. In the event  of  a  significant  risk  being  identified,  the  escalation procedure  will  be  implemented  and  Senior  Management and the Board of Directors notified, if necessary;\n- \u00b7 draws up Compliance reports which are presented to the entity's Compliance Committee and forwarded to Amundi's  Compliance  Department:  these  Compliance reports describe the way in which Compliance is ensured, the  key  elements  thereof  and  the  lessons  learned  from measuring and monitoring the risks of non-compliance.\n\nBased  on  the  reports  of  its  subsidiaries,  as  well  as  on  the results of its own controls, the Head of Amundi's Compliance Department  produces  the  annual  Compliance  report  for Amundi's  Senior  Management  and  Board  of  Directors,  and informs the Head of Compliance of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole.\n\n## 5.3.3.2.2 Risk monitoring scheme\n\nThe main non-compliance risks are grouped together by level of risk in the following categories:\n\n- \u00b7 market integrity;\n- \u00b7 financial security;\n- \u00b7 professional ethics;\n- \u00b7 protection  for  clients  and  unitholders,  particularly  in relation to communications and ESG commitments;\n- \u00b7 prevention of fraud, corruption and conflicts of interest.\n\nNon-compliance risks are identified and assessed each year for  each  compliance  topic  within  the  \"non-compliance  risk mapping\".  These  maps  are  drawn  up  by  each  Group  entity and consolidated at the Amundi level.\n\nThe  Compliance  Department's  control  plan  is  aligned  with the non-compliance risks identified in the risk mapping. It is reviewed  periodically  and  validated  by  the  Compliance Committee at the start of the year.\n\nThe  Compliance  procedures  are  based  on  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole S.A.'s compliance  procedures  and  include  the  specific characteristics  of  the  business  lines  offered  by  Amundi  and its subsidiaries, particularly asset management.  These procedures apply to all  entities  in  the  Amundi  Group.  They are  accompanied  by  a  set  of  compliance  checks  that  are common to  all  entities,  ensuring  consistent  implementation of controls across the entire Group.\n\n## Market integrity\n\nRegulations  require  investment  service  providers  such  as Amundi to act in an honest, fair and professional manner that promotes  market  integrity.  The  Group  ensures  compliance with market integrity through checks on transactions and the way they are executed in the markets (time-stamping, preallocation  of  orders,  partial  execution,  management  of market  abuse  alerts,  monitoring  of  threshold  crossings, application of best execution criteria, etc.).\n\n## Monitoring of order allocation\n\nThe  system  in  place  is  based  on  a  strict  separation  of  the Portfolio Management and Trading business lines. Investment managers'  trading  orders  are  placed  and  processed  by  the Trading business line. A procedure outlines each stage of the process, which involves Investment Management, the Trading Desk and the Middle Office, using a single IT platform which systematically time stamps and pre-allocates orders from the moment they are entered and ensures a complete audit trail.\n\nThe order placement system uses a default model whereby, in  the  event  of  partial  execution,  the  allocation  of  partial quantities  is  determined  in  proportion  to  the  quantities initially requested. This method ensures the fair allocation of traded quantities.\n\n## \"Best selection and execution\" process\n\nAmundi has committed to take all reasonable steps to obtain the best possible result when executing orders. Amundi has implemented a selection and execution policy that applies to all financial instruments covered by Directive 2014/65/EU on markets in financial instruments (MiFID II) that are traded on financial  markets  by  intermediaries.  In  order  to  obtain  the best execution possible, Amundi has chosen to use Amundi Interm\u00e9diation  for  its  transmission  and  order  execution activities. Amundi Interm\u00e9diation has been approved by the Autorit\u00e9 de contr\u00f4le prudentiel et de r\u00e9solution (ACPR) as an investment company  able  to  provide  Reception  and Transmission of Orders (RTO) services and order execution on behalf of third parties relating to all financial instruments specified  in  Article  L.  211-1  of  the  French  Monetary  and Financial Code.\n\nAll measures are taken to ensure that the execution of orders is in the best interest of the client and promotes the integrity of  the  market  by  taking  into  account  the  following  factors: price,  cost,  speed,  probability  of  execution  and  settlement, size,  nature  of  the  order  and  any  other  considerations relating to the execution of the order. Amundi Interm\u00e9diation regularly re-examines the conditions and mechanisms it uses for  order  execution.  In  the  absence  of  internal  or  external events  requiring  a  review  during  the  course  of  the  year, Amundi Interm\u00e9diation's execution policy is reviewed on an annual basis during the selection committees. This review is formalised in the reports drawn up by these committees.",

        "page_content": "## Financial security\n\nIn  accordance with the applicable legislative and regulatory provisions  and  professional  standards,  each  Amundi  entity contributes at its respective level by:\n\n- \u00b7 implementing  procedures  to  prevent  money  laundering and  the  financing  of  terrorism  as  well  as  tax  fraud, including  in  particular  the  submission  of  a  suspicious activity report to the competent  national  financial intelligence unit, where necessary;\n- \u00b7 monitoring  flows  in  accordance  with  the  rules  on embargoes  and  asset  freezes  decided  by  the  UN,  the European  Union,  OFAC  and  States;  and  in  particular refusing to execute transactions that would contravene the applicable rules on embargoes and asset freezes;\n- \u00b7 adopting a pragmatic approach based on an assessment of the risks, due to the fact that certain situations present a higher  or  lower  risk  than  others,  by  implementing  a  risk assessment  and  management  system  associated  with financial  security.  The  aim  is  to  limit  risks  and  focus  the prevention effort on the most exposed situations.\n\n## Professional ethics\n\nAmundi  employees  undertake  to  comply  strictly  with  the applicable ethical standards in accordance with the law, and with  the  regulations  and  codes  of  conduct  in  force. Compliance with ethical standards is an essential element of the quality of service that Amundi is committed to delivering to its clients.\n\nThe holding of inside or confidential information is governed by  special  procedures  that  reiterate  the  obligations  of  the employees concerned and require the compilation of insider lists  and  confidentiality  lists.  Employees  on  those  lists  are informed of the fact, and they are reminded of the relevant conduct rules at that time.\n\nAmundi  aims  to  develop  and  promote  a  strong  culture  of compliance  in  accordance  with  the  laws  and  regulations  in force. The Compliance Department provides Amundi employees  with  mandatory  training  sessions,  available  in e -learning or face-to-face format.\n\n## Protection for clients and unitholders\n\nAs an investment services provider, Amundi:\n\n- \u00b7 ensures  that  information  about  the  products  offered  to clients  and  UCI  unitholders  is  clear,  transparent  and  not misleading, particularly in relation to ESG;\n- \u00b7 ensures that clients and unitholders are treated fairly;\n- \u00b7 refrains  from  placing  the  interests  of  a  group  of  clients, unitholders,  shareholders,  or  its  own  interests,  ahead of those of another group  of clients, unitholders or shareholders.\n\nIn  particular,  the  Compliance  Department  ensures  that  any information produced is balanced and of high quality, verifies that  clients  are  offered  appropriate  products,  approves  all new  products  or  any  substantial  change  to  an  existing product,  and  checks  that  responses  to  any  complaints submitted by clients and unitholders comply with procedures.\n\n## Preventing fraud, corruption and conflicts of interest\n\nWithin  Amundi,  the  system  for  preventing  the  risk  of  fraud applies  to  all  Amundi  businesses  and  offices  in  France  and worldwide. It aims to manage the consequences of fraud in the  broadest  sense,  whether  this  involves  financial  loss, regulatory  risk  or  reputational  risk.  This  system  is  built around three pillars: prevention, detection and management of fraud.\n\nThe  anti-corruption  measures  implemented  by  Amundi notably include:\n\n- \u00b7 monitoring  the  gifts  and  benefits  employees  give  or receive in the course of their professional activities;\n- \u00b7 incorporating  clauses  in  the  contracts  it  has  with  its partners that enable Amundi to terminate the relationship if the partner is involved in acts of corruption;\n- \u00b7 implementing  an  annual  non-compliance  risk  mapping system that includes the risk of corruption;\n- \u00b7 enabling any internal or external Amundi stakeholder who suspects or is aware of the existence of a corruption risk to report it through a special tool available to everyone.\n\nIn  order  to  protect  and  prioritise  the  interests  of  its  clients, Amundi has implemented a policy for identifying, preventing and managing any conflicts of interest that may arise during the  course  of  its  business.  The  system  for  preventing conflicts of interest is based partly on a map that identifies situations  posing  a  risk  of  a  conflict  of  interest,  the preparation and rating of conflict of interest scenarios, and a set of controls covering risky situations. In addition, Amundi is  organised  into  business  lines  to  separate  the  various functions likely to give rise to conflicts of interest, including Senior Management.\n\n## Governance information\n\nIn  2023,  Senior  Management  was  updated  on  Compliance matters as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 monthly, at Compliance Committee meetings, during which the  results  of  controls  performed  by  Compliance  were presented;\n- \u00b7 annually, via the annual report on the management of noncompliance risk.\n\nThe Board of Directors receives regular information through presentations  given  by  the  Board's  Risk  Management Committee, which cover:\n\n- \u00b7 the  system  for  managing  non-compliance  risk  (including non-compliance risk mapping);\n- \u00b7 the control plan and the results of controls.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

It  combines  divisions  with different  expert  departments  in  charge  of  the  security  of persons and property, business continuity, information systems security (see \"Management framework for the risks associated with information and communications technology\") or personal data protection. The Security Department helps combat fraud notably by coordinating relations with the judicial authority and, more specifically, investigation services.\n\n## Governance specifically for security issues\n\nThe  activities  and  controls  carried  out  by  the  Security function are regularly presented to Senior Management by a number of committees:\n\n- \u00b7 Security Committee (COMSEC): this decision-making body, chaired by the Deputy Chief Executive Officer in charge of the  Strategy,  Finance  and  Control  Division  (SFC),  meets four  times  a  year  and  determines  measures  relating  to  IT security  (cybersecurity),  physical  security  and  business continuity (operational resilience);\n- \u00b7 Monthly  Internal  Control  Committee  (ICC):  the  activity  and results  of  ongoing  controls  are  regularly  presented  to  Senior Management by this Committee;\n- \u00b7 Board  Risk  Management  Committee:  the  Board  of Directors is briefed regularly, at least twice a year.\n\nGiven the nature of the risks,  particular  attention  is  paid  to the cyber resilience plan, the progress of which is monitored by the Chief Executive Officer.\n\nThe  Security  Department  is  a  part  of  the  Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors.\n\n## Certifications\n\nThe  certifications  to  the  international  standards  chosen  by Amundi were renewed in 2023:\n\n- \u00b7 ISAE  3402  Type  2  (International  Standard  on  Assurance Engagements)  which  demonstrates  the  maturity  of  the controls in place, particularly in terms of IT security.\n- \u00b7 SOC  2  Type  II  (Systems  and  Organisations  Controls, standard developed by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants), which provides sufficient guarantees of  the  effectiveness  of  controls  relating  to  the  security, availability, integrity and confidentiality of data.\n- \u00b7 Financial  Security  and  third-party  knowledge  files  (KYx), particularly  in  connection  with  the  sanctions  against Russia;\n- \u00b7 implementing an ESG compliance control plan;\n- \u00b7 the continuous updating of our system of controls for the risks  of  non-compliance  (in  particular  the  systems  for preventing conflicts of interest and  anti-corruption, including our international entities within the Group);\n- \u00b7 promoting  a  culture  of  compliance  and  the  ethical attitudes expected of employees.\n\n## Business continuity\n\nAmundi's  overall  business  continuity  plan  derives  from  the regulations and also from Cr\u00e9dit Agricole group procedures that include disaster scenarios. It is adapted to Amundi's own business  and  each  subsidiary  has  its  own  version  that incorporates the local regulatory framework  and  the activities of each entity. Based on an analysis of the criticality of the various business lines, and regularly reviewed so as to take  into  account  any  changes  in  risks  and  the  associated disaster  scenarios,  the  business  continuity  plan  includes  a \"crisis  management\" and \"communications\" component and is  designed  to  ensure  that  the  company's  critical  business operations  can  continue  quickly.  The  overall  continuity system  is  coordinated  by  a  dedicated  team  within  the Security  Department.  It  is  supported  by  business  lines  that regularly conduct business continuity tests. The results of the tests,  the  associated  action  plans  and  the  controls  are shared with the Security Committee and the Risk Management Committee of the Board of Directors.\n\n## Physical security\n\nThe security of persons and property is dependant upon risk and threat mapping:\n\n- \u00b7 with regard to health and safety in the workplace, the Single Risk  Assessment  Document  ( Document  Unique  d'Evaluation des  Risques ,  DUER)  maps  out  the  risks.  It  is  coordinated  by Human Resources, with the Security Department contributing directly  to  the  areas  for  which  it  is  responsible.  The  DUER  is accompanied by the Annual Programme for the Prevention of Occupational  Risks  and  Improvement  of  Working  Conditions (Programme Annuel de Pr\u00e9vention des Risques Professionnels et  d'Am\u00e9lioration  des  Conditions  de  Travail,  PAPRIPACT),  a document  that  is  updated  annually  and  highlights  the measures  taken  to  prevent  and  continually  reduce  each  risk listed;\n- \u00b7 with regard to the risks associated with the central buildings operated by Amundi, regulatory inspections are carried out by the  department  in  charge  of  property  and  operations;  the Security  Department  carries  out  Level  2  inspections  of  the main risks  (risks  of  personal  injury  or  risks  affecting  business continuity);\n- \u00b7 in terms of security, the strategy implemented by the Security Department  is  based  on  a  range  of  threats  and  associated security objectives approved by Amundi's Senior Management.  It  aims  to  anticipate,  avert,  detect,  prevent  or, failing that, limit the consequences of malicious action against people,  buildings  or  assets  located  there.  This  strategy  is implemented through dedicated organisation, procedures and human  and  material  resources  (access  control,  physical barriers,  video  surveillance,  24-hour  Central  Security  Station monitoring  and  controlling  access  to  Amundi's  data  centres located  in  the  Ile  de  France  region,  etc.)  and  is  subject  to controls  which  are  presented  twice  a  year  to  the  Security Committee.",

        "page_content": "## Management framework for the risks associated with information and communications technology (ICT)\n\nWithin the \"security\"  function,  a  team  of  experts,  operating under the direct supervision of the Chief Information Security Officer , is responsible for managing and monitoring the risks associated with information and communications technology (ICT). This team is an offshoot of the IT Systems Department (ISD),  which  comes  under  the  Operations  Division  (OST).  It has  human  resources,  a  budget,  a  reporting  line  to  Senior Management  and,  as  a  result,  the  expertise,  skills  and appropriate  independence  for  risk  management  related  to information security.\n\nWhen rolling out the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole group's policy, the Chief Information  Security  Officer  is  responsible  for  defining  and implementing a strategy  in  order  to  anticipate  and  prevent any  breaches  to  the  integrity,  confidentiality,  availability  or traceability  of  data,  information  assets  and  ICT  assets. This  strategy  is  expressed  in  an  information  security  policy, which  has  been  approved  by  the  Amundi  management (Security  Committee  and  Risk  Management  Committee  of the  Board  of  Directors).  The  same  applies  for  the  digital operational  resilience  strategy  and  the  associated  response plans  (emergency,  communication  and  recovery/rebuilding plan).\n\nThe risk management framework is updated every year, or if there is a major incident.\n\nThe CISO's team  implements  procedures  tailored  to Amundi's own Information Security (IS) activities and ensure that  they  are  performed  properly.  It  is  also  responsible  for protecting the information systems, detecting any malicious acts or acts that breach internal policy and for responding to such acts.\n\nIn  view  of  cybersecurity threats, the CISO team is part of a wider system, organised primarily within the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole group and specifically  the  CERT-AG  (Computer  Emergency Response  Team  -  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole),  which  is  in  charge  of predicting, monitoring and responding to incidents (available 24/7).  In  addition  to  the  capacities  provided  by  the  Cr\u00e9dit Agricole  group,  Amundi's  CISO  team  relies  on  its  own Security  Operation  Centre  (SOC),  a  team  responsible  for detecting  and  handling  security  incidents.  The  CISO  is  also responsible for developing external partnerships to improve and optimise the processes for predicting and responding to incidents.  In  this  context,  Amundi  most  notably  established closer ties with the French government's agencies in charge of  cybersecurity,  namely  the  Cyber  Authority  of  the  French Gendarmerie (ComCyberGend). Created in August 2021, this authority is an agency of the French Ministry of the Interior, operating under the supervision of the Director of the French Gendarmerie.  Comprising  top-level  experts,  particularly  in the field of digital investigations, it works to prevent threats and protect major national interests. By decree published in the  French  Official  Journal  on  23  November  2023,  this  unit became  the  Cyber  Authority  of  the  Ministry  of  the  Interior (ComCyber-MI). These exchanges between Amundi and the French Gendarmerie include sharing experiences and expertise.  They  aim  to  establish  a  cyber  crisis  management plan  for  potential  cyberattacks,  including  those  involving ransomware.\n\nAmundi employees have an essential role to play within the framework  of  this  information  security  strategy,  actively contributing to the detection of hacking attempts and fraud as  well  as  to  the  protection  of  data  and  the  information system. In order to continually strengthen this active first line of  defence,  mandatory  training  and  awareness  campaigns are  regularly  carried  out  as  well  as  phishing  tests  to  raise awareness  of  the  risks  and  check  employees'  ability  to identify suspicious emails.\n\nManaging risks associated with information and communications  technology  (ICT)  relies  on  permanent controls that include vulnerability scans or regular penetration  tests  on  infrastructures,  applications  or  data. These  test  campaigns  are  mainly  conducted  by  third-party businesses and take various forms. These tests may include:\n\n- \u00b7 intrusion  tests  targeted  at  an  application,  a  section  of infrastructure or a particular system;\n- \u00b7 Threat Led Penetration Tests: these tests are conducted by Red Teams, made up of experts outside of Amundi, who simulate  an  adversary's  operating  processes  (tactics, techniques  and  procedures),  with  the  aim  of  penetrating information systems in order to jeopardise their integrity, exfiltrate  data  or  corrupt  them.  The  Red  Teams  rely  on, among other things, social engineering, targeted phishing campaigns and a vulnerability analysis of the most critical assets  of  the  target  businesses  in  order  to  carry  out physical and logical intrusions. These regular tests identify vulnerabilities that could be exploited by a malicious actor;\n- \u00b7 Purple Teams, which work alongside the teams in charge of  protecting  information  systems  (known  as  Blue  Teams for  the  purposes  of  these  tests,  composed  of  Amundi employees based at the company's own  Security Operation  Centre)  against  Red  Team-type  attacks.  The goal  is  to  capitalise  on  and  share  experience  in  order  to continuously strengthen detection, protection and response capabilities by learning from the various attacks and methods used by adversaries.\n\nThe  results  of  these  controls  are  shared  monthly  with  an operational  committee  (the  Information  Security  Steering Committee),  quarterly  with  the  Security  Committee  and  at least  once  a  year  with  the  Risk  Management  Committee  of the Board of Directors.\n\nFor Group subsidiaries located outside France, the implementation  of  the  cyber  security  strategy  and  the monitoring  of  checks  are  supported  by  a  governance approach  that  includes  the  ISD's  teams,  business  lines  and the various countries where Amundi is present.\n\nIn the context of evolving cybersecurity threats and notably ransomware  attacks,  the  information  security  strategy includes a multi-year cyber resilience plan that aims to limit the  risk  of  interruptions  to  the  information  system;  specific attention is paid to this plan.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

In response to this high threat level, this programme covers business  continuity,  information  security  and  organisational resilience issues. It aims  to  constantly  increase  Amundi's capabilities  around  anticipating  and  detecting  threats,  and protecting  information  systems.  The  Cyber  Crisis  Management Plan  defines  the  organisations,  procedures  and  resources committed should there be an incident and includes:\n\n- \u00b7 a communication plan;\n- \u00b7 an emergency plan to respond to incidents and minimise the consequences  of  any  attack,  and  ensure  the  continuity  of critical or important functions;\n- \u00b7 a data recovery plan or a rebuilding plan for all or part of the information system should an attack occur.\n\nThe \"cyber-resilience\" programme is operationally monitored by a specific quarterly steering committee, which includes activities identified  as  critical,  chaired  by  the  Head  of  Governance  and General  Secretary.  Any  progress  made  by  the  programme  is presented to and approved by the Security Committee and the Risk Management Committee of the Board of Directors at least once a year.\n\nSince 2023, the Security Department has been a member of the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors.\n\n## Awareness campaigns, crisis exercises and resilience tests\n\nIn 2023, in order to ensure the continuity of critical functions in the  event  of  a  major  cyber  attack,  operational  resilience  tests were conducted in order to validate the emergency, communication and rebuilding plans.\n\nIn addition, a cyber crisis exercise was organised with Amundi's entire  Senior  Management  (Global  Management  Committee)  in conjunction with external actors (notably the French Ministry of the Interior).\n\nAwareness-raising  campaigns  have  also  been  organised  for  all Amundi employees:\n\n- \u00b7 a mandatory cybersecurity training session:\n- \u00b7 phishing  test  campaigns  four  times  a  year,  followed  by appropriate and compulsory additional training sessions;\n- \u00b7 an online conference in March 2023 to illustrate the evolution of cyber risks and threats;\n- \u00b7 during Cyber Security Month in October, a weekly presentation on a specific theme illustrated by an educational video:\n- \u00b7 Week  1:  Repeated  authentication  attacks  (MFA  Fatigue attacks),\n- \u00b7 Week 2: External fraud,\n- \u00b7 Week 3: Personal email risks,\n- \u00b7 Week 4: Protecting data externally,\n- \u00b7 Week 5: Security tips.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 5.3.3.4 Periodic control\n\nThe Amundi Internal Audit Department reports hierarchically to the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. General Internal Audit Department and  operationally  to  Amundi's  Senior  Management.  The Periodic  Control  system  includes  a  central  Internal  Audit team, which covers the entire Amundi  scope, and decentralised Internal Audit teams  in several of its subsidiaries,  which  report  to  local  management  and  to Amundi's Head of Internal Audit.\n\nIntegrated  within  the  Internal  Audit  business  line  of  the majority shareholder, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A., Amundi's periodic control system is based on the tools and methods adopted by  the  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  group,  in  particular  with  regard  to audit  mapping,  planning  and  conducting  audits,  monitoring implementation  of  recommendations  and  reporting  on follow-up to its work.\n\nThe  audit  plan  is  drawn  up  on  the  basis  of  the  multi-year audit  programme  derived  from  the  Amundi  Group's  risk mapping.  It  also  factors  in  requests  from  Amundi's  Senior Management,  the  Internal  Audit  business  line  of  Cr\u00e9dit Agricole  S.A.  and  the  Risk  Management  Committee  of  the Board of Directors. The objective of the multi-year program is to cover the audit scope (which is based on the scope of the monitored entities) over a maximum of five years, with an average frequency of three years used.",

General  Internal  Audit  Department  and  by supervisory authorities are subject to this formal monitoring system which ensures that remedial actions are implemented within the deadlines agreed with the entity's management at the  end  of  the  audit.  The  system  also  enables  the  Head  of Internal Audit to issue alerts to the Board of Directors when\n\nnecessary,  as  set  out  in  Article  26  of  the  Order  of 3 November 2014.\n\nThe audit conclusions are presented to Senior Management, the Board of Directors' Risk Management Committee and the Board of Directors, who are also kept updated regarding the progress made to implement the recommendations.\n\nFinally,  the  approach  taken  by  Amundi's  Internal  Audit function  is  subject  to  an  ongoing  quality  improvement process.\n\n## 5.3.3.5 Specific internal control system for accounting, financial and non-financial information\n\n## Preparation of accounting, financial and non-financial information\n\nUnder  the  authority  of  the  Senior  Management,  Amundi's Finance  Department  is  responsible  for  preparing  the accounting  and  financial  information.  In  particular,  the Finance Department:\n\n- \u00b7 draws  up  the  consolidated  financial statements in accordance with international accounting standards (IFRS) and the accounting rules and principles set and distributed by the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole group;\n- \u00b7 prepares  the  financial  statements  of  each  entity  in accordance with current local accounting standards;\n- \u00b7 prepares  the  various  regulatory,  prudential  and  fiscal reports;\n- \u00b7 produces  the  various  pieces  of  management  information necessary to steer the activities;\n- \u00b7 is responsible for Amundi's financial communications with investors and other stakeholders.\n\nThe CSR unit is also responsible for preparing non-financial information.\n\n## Permanent controls on accounting, financial information and extra-financial information\n\nThe  accounting  and  financial  information  control  system within  the  Finance  Department  is  based  on  checks  carried out  on  the  one  hand  by  the  Accounting,  Management Control,  Asset  Management  and  Financial  Communication teams,  and  on  the  other,  by  an  accounts  auditing  unit reporting directly to the Chief Financial Officer. This system is supported by permanent accounting controls provided by an  independent  team  reporting  to  the  Risk  Management function.\n\nThe  permanent  accounting  control  objectives  are  designed to  ensure  adequate  hedging  of  the  major  accounting  risk which could alter the quality of the accounting and financial information in terms of:\n\n- \u00b7 compliance of data with regard to the legal and regulatory provisions, and the standards of the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole group;\n- \u00b7 reliability  and  accuracy  of  the  data,  so  that  it  provides  a true  picture  of  the  earnings  and  financial  position  of Amundi and of entities within its scope of consolidation;\n- \u00b7 security of the data preparation and processing procedures,  limiting  the  operational  risk  with  regard  to Amundi's commitment to the information published;\n- \u00b7 prevention of the risk of fraud and accounting irregularities.\n\nThe  permanent  controls  on  the  accounting  and  financial information  are  based  on  an  evaluation  of  the  risks  and controls  of  the  accounting  processes  managed  by  the operational  units.  In  particular,  the  risks  monitored  by  the Risk Management Department, especially those related to the off-balance-sheet commitments, are reconciled with Accounting  in  order  to  ensure  that  the  information  is complete  and  is  properly  evaluated  in  the  financial statements.\n\nThe  Head  of  Amundi's  Permanent  Accounting  Control ensures that any corrective actions are implemented in order to reinforce the system of permanent accounting controls.\n\nThe control system for non-financial information is based on the controls implemented by the CSR, Responsible Investment,  General  Secretary,  HR  and  Finance  Department teams and, on a secondary level, on those implemented by Amundi's  Risk  and  Compliance  functions.  A  review  by  its Statutory  Auditors  is  also  performed  to  ensure  that Responsible  Investment  assets  are  properly  calculated  and reported.\n\n## Relationships with Statutory Auditors\n\nIn accordance  with  current  professional  standards,  the Statutory Auditors carry out work as they deem necessary on the accounting and financial information published:\n\n- \u00b7 audit of the separate and consolidated financial statements;\n- \u00b7 a  limited  audit  of  the  half-yearly  consolidated  financial statements;\n- \u00b7 a reading of all the supporting materials for the published financial information.\n\nAs part of their legal mandate, the Statutory Auditors present their  findings  to  the  Audit  Committee  and  to  Amundi's Board of Directors.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Amundi  defines  its  risk  appetite  by  including  the  essential dimensions of its business: the attractiveness of the products it offers, the strength of its financial position and the pursuit of its short and long-term profitability objectives.\n\nThe formalisation of Amundi's risk appetite is instructive for Senior Management and the Board of Directors as they plan the Group's development trajectory and how that translates into each business line's strategy.\n\nThis  formalisation  is  the  result  of  a  coordinated  and  shared effort among the Finance, Risk Management, Compliance and Security Departments and has as its goal:\n\n- \u00b7 to formalise, standardise and specify the acceptable level of  risk  (framework  of  standards)  relating  to  a  given strategy;\n- \u00b7 to  fully  integrate  the  risk/return  relationship  into  the strategic steering and decision-making process;\n- \u00b7 to  have  at  hand  sophisticated  indicators  and  alert thresholds  enabling  Senior  Management  to  anticipate  an excessive  deterioration  in  strategic  indicators  and  to improve resilience by employing certain mechanisms in the event that an alert level is reached compared to standard risk appetite;\n- \u00b7 to  improve  external  communications  with  third  parties, regulators and investors concerning earnings stability and the management of risk.\n\nAmundi's risk appetite framework for the 2023 financial year was set out at the Board of Directors meeting of 8 December 2022.\n\n- \u00b7 to  engage  the  Directors  of  the  Board  and  Senior Management  in  discussions  and  conversations  about risk -taking;\n\n## Process for formalising the risk appetite framework\n\nIn  line  with  the  Group's  policy,  Amundi  expresses  its  risk appetite in terms of key indicators, broken down into three levels of risk:\n\n- \u00b7 appetite refers  to  the  normal,  recurring  management  of risk.  This is expressed in the form of budget objectives in terms  of  solvency,  liquidity  and  profitability,  as  well  as operational  limits  pertaining  to  market,  asset-liability management  and  credit  risk  which,  if  breached,  are immediately flagged and corrected by Senior Management;\n- \u00b7 tolerance refers  to  managing  a  deteriorated  risk  level  on an  exceptional  basis.  When  tolerance  thresholds  are breached,  this  immediately  triggers  a  report  to  the Chairman  of  the  Risk  Management  Committee  of  the Amundi  Board  of  Directors  and,  when  appropriate,  the Board of Directors itself;\n- \u00b7 capacity refers  to  the  maximum level of risk that Amundi could theoretically assume without violating its operational or regulatory constraints.\n\nWhen these thresholds are breached, the supervisory bodies of  the  Company  are  informed  in  proportion  to  the  level  of risk incurred.\n\nFurthermore,  although  Amundi  chooses  most  of  its  risks  as part  of  its  strategic  plan,  certain  risks  such  as  operational risks and some non-compliance risks are inevitably going to be  incurred,  even  though  the  protective  measures  and  the control systems in place may limit their occurrence and their potential  consequences.  Amundi  has  zero  appetite  for voluntary  risk-taking  in  terms  of  non-compliance  risks,  IT risks and, more generally, societal and environmental risks.\n\n## Key performance indicators in the risk profile as of 31 December 2023\n\nIn  2023,  Amundi  used  ten  key  performance  indicators  to express its risk appetite and risk profile:\n\n## \u00b7 four overall indicators of risk exposure:\n\n- \u00b7 total Risk-Weighted  Assets (RWA)  within  the  meaning of  the  CRD  IV  regulation.  As  at  31  December  2023, Amundi's RWA totalled \u20ac14,261 million,\n- \u00b7 RWA  in  terms  of  credit  risk  (including  threshold allowances and CVA) and market risk, which was \u20ac8,580 million as at 31 December 2023,\n- \u00b7 RWA  in  terms  of  operational  risk,  which  was  \u20ac5,681 million as at 31 December 2023. This indicator shows the implementation of controls and supervision, the purpose of which is to reduce the impact of operational risk to the incompressible minimum,\n- \u00b7 the Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) solvency ratio, which stood at 21.7% as at 31 December;\n\n## \u00b7 two indicators of balance-sheet liquidity:\n\n- \u00b7 the Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR): as at 31 December 2023,  Amundi's  long-term  structural  liquidity  ratio  is 115%,\n- \u00b7 the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR): Amundi's LCR as at 31 December 2023 was 389%;\n\n## \u00b7 four profitability indicators:\n\n- \u00b7 cost  of  risk,  which  takes  into  account  credit  risk (particularly  default  by  an  issuer  or  counterparty  that may affect Amundi) in addition to operational risk and, where  applicable,  any  market  risk  arising  from  the management  of  guaranteed  funds  and  mandates.  For the 2023 financial year, Amundi's cost of risk was \u20ac2.6 million,\n- \u00b7 accounting  cost-to-income  ratio,  which  reached  54.6% for the 2023 financial year,\n- \u00b7 accounting net income Group share NIGS (Net Income Group  Share),  which  for  the  2023  financial  year amounted to \u20ac1,165 million,\n- \u00b7 equity-accounted net income from joint ventures, which for the 2023 financial year amounted to \u20ac102.0 million.\n\nFor the 2023 financial year and as at 31 December 2023, the various key indicators of the risk profile were situated within the  acceptable  risk  range  defined  by  Amundi  and  did  not reach their tolerance thresholds.",

        "page_content": "## 5.4 SOLVENCY AND CAPITAL ADEQUACY\n\n## 5.4.1 Solvency ratios\n\n## 5.4.1.1 Applicable regulatory framework\n\nAs a credit institution, Amundi is subject to French prudential regulations, which implement into French law the provisions of  the  EU  Directive  \"Access  to  the  activity  of  credit institutions and the prudential supervision of credit institutions and investment firms\".\n\nAmundi has managed its capital so as to satisfy the levels of regulatory  capital  defined  in  the  EU  Directive  2013/36 (CRD  s4),  amended  by  Directive  2019/878  (CRD  5),  and European Regulation 575/2013 (CRR), amended by Regulation  2019/876  (CRR  2)  and  required  by  the  relevant authorities,  the  European  Central  Bank  and  the  Autorit\u00e9  de contr\u00f4le  prudentiel  et  de  r\u00e9solution  (ACPR)  to  cover  riskweighted assets in terms of credit risks, operational risks and market risks.\n\nRegulatory  capital,  calculated  based  on  Amundi's  reporting entities, breaks down into three categories:\n\n- \u00b7 Common Equity Tier 1 capital (CET1);\n- \u00b7 Additional Tier 1 capital (AT1);\n- \u00b7 Tier 2 capital consisting of equity and debt instruments, to which various adjustments are made.\n\nRegulatory capital is obtained from accounting shareholders' equity.  The  adjustments  made  (prudential  filters)  mostly involve  deducting  goodwill  and  intangible  assets  (net  of deferred taxes).\n\nAmundi  principally  holds  CET1  capital,  consisting  of  share capital and undistributed reserves. In addition, it holds \u20ac300 million  of  Tier  2  capital,  comprised  of  subordinated  debt issued  with  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  S.A.  as  part  of  financing  the acquisition  of  the  subsidiaries  of  the  Pioneer  Group  (first maturing  in  2027).  In  August  2022,  an  initial  instalment  of \u20ac100 million euros was repaid and a new subordinated debt of  \u20ac100  million  was  established  over  a  period  of  10  years, with maturity in 2032. In August 2023, a second instalment of \u20ac100 million euros was repaid and a new subordinated debt of  \u20ac100  million  was  established  over  a  period  of  10  years, with maturity in 2033.\n\n## 5.4.1.2 Minimum regulatory requirements\n\nThe requirements for Pillar  1  are  governed  by  the  CRR  regulation.  The  regulator  also  sets,  on  a  discretionary  basis,  minimum requirements under Pillar 2.\n\n## Minimum requirements of Pillar 1\n\n- \u00b7 Capital ratios before buffers: the capital requirements set under  Tier  1  comprise  a  minimum  CET1  capital  ratio  of 4.5%, a minimum Tier 1 capital ratio of 6% and a minimum global capital ratio of 8%.\n- \u00b7 These  requirements  are  supplemented  by  capital  buffer requirements:\n- \u00b7 the  capital  conservation  buffer  (2.5%  of  risk-weighted assets),\n- \u00b7 the countercyclical buffer (between 0 and 2.5% of range of risk-weighted assets),\n- \u00b7 systemic  risk  buffers  (generally  between  0%  and  3%, and up to 5% with European Commission approval, and more exceptionally over 5%) and for global systemically important banks (G-SIBs) (between 0% and 3.5%) or for the  other  systemically  important  institutions  (O-SIIs) (between 0% and 2%). These buffers are not cumulative and, generally speaking, with some exceptions, only the highest  will  apply.  Only  the  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  group belongs  to  the  systemically  important  institutions category. Amundi does not fall under these categories,\n- \u00b7 these buffers must be covered by CET1 capital.\n\n## Minimum requirements of Pillar 2\n\nSince  2017,  the  ECB  has  changed  the  methodology  used, splitting the regulatory requirements into two parts:\n\n- \u00b7 a Pillar  2  Requirement (P2R). This  requirement applies to all levels of capital. Non-compliance with this requirement automatically results in restrictions on distributions (coupons on additional Tier 1 capital instruments, dividends,  variable  compensation).  Consequently,  this requirement is published. The P2R is made up of at least 75% Tier 1 capital, including a minimum 75% of CET1;\n- \u00b7 a Pillar 2 Guidance (P2G), which is not currently published and  must  be  made  up  entirely  of  Common  Equity  Tier  1 capital (CET1).\n\nSince  1  January  2020,  Amundi  has  no  longer  had  any additional capital requirements  under  the  Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process - SREP (P2G and P2R). As a result, as at 31 December 2023, the minimum regulatory level for compliance was 7.3% for the CET1 ratio and 10.8% for the Total Capital ratio. These levels included the requirements of Pillar 1, the capital conservation buffer and the countercyclical buffer.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

It is up by 260 bps (19.1% in 2022), mainly due to the retention of profits.\n\nThe reconciliation between accounting equity and regulatory capital is presented  in  section  4.4  of  this  Universal Registration Document.\n\nThe key figures are set out in section 5.5 below.\n\nAmundi  has  applied  IFRS  9  to  financial  instruments  since  1 January  2018.  Accordingly,  the  impact  associated  with  the new  classification  and  the  measurement  principles  for financial instruments and the writing down of credit risk was all  taken  into  account  with  regard  to  Amundi's  capital.  This impact was not material for Amundi.\n\nFor credit risk purposes, risk-weighted assets are calculated using  the  standardised  prudential  method  set  out  in  the regulations. In practice, for the three main types of exposure:\n\n- \u00b7 for  the  investment  portfolio,  risk-weighted  assets  are calculated  on  a  transparent  basis,  taking  into  account assets actually held by the funds in which Amundi invests; risk-weighted assets related to these underlying assets are valued  for  regulatory  purposes  using  the  standardised prudential method;\n- \u00b7 for  guarantees  given  to  funds,  risk-weighted  assets  are also  calculated  using  the  standardised  approach  with respect  to  recognition  of  the  guarantee  mechanism.  The assets  held  by  the  funds  benefiting  from  the  guarantees are  then  estimated  on  a  transparent  basis  using  the standardised approach;\n- \u00b7 for Amundi Finance's derivatives transactions, risk -weighted assets are valued according to the standardised prudential standards (\"valued at their market price\" method).\n\n## 5.4.2 Leverage ratio\n\nThe leverage ratio is the ratio of a bank's Tier 1 capital to its leverage  exposure,  i.e.  total  assets  plus  off-balance  sheet items  after  certain  restatements  for  derivatives,  intra-group transactions, financial securities transactions, items deducted from the numerator and off-balance sheet items.\n\nIt was defined by the Basel Committee as part of the Basel III agreements and transposed into European law by article 429 of the CRR, amended by Delegated Regulation 62/2015 of 10 October  2014  and  published  in  the  Official  Journal  of  the European Union on 18 January 2015.\n\nSince  the  European  regulation  CRR  2  was  published  in  the Official  Journal  of  the  European  Union  on  7  June  2019,  the leverage  ratio  has  become  a  Pillar  1  minimum  requirement with effect from 28 June 2021:\n\nFor market risks,  the  risk-weighted  assets  are  mainly  linked to unhedged structural foreign exchange exposures.\n\nCapital requirements  for  operational  risk  are  partially calculated  using  the  advanced  measurement  approach (AMA) developed by the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole group and used by Amundi.  Use  of  the  AMA  method  was  approved  by  the French  Autorit\u00e9  de  contr\u00f4le  prudentiel  in  2007  and  then confirmed in 2010.\n\nThe  AMA  model  for  capital  calculation  is  based  on  an actuarial  Loss  Distribution  Approach,  taking  into  account both internal and external factors.\n\nInternal factors (change in the entity's risk profile) include:\n\n- \u00b7 changes in the entity's organisational structure, change in risk  profile  of  the  business  and  risk  mapping,  change  in internal losses;\n- \u00b7 quality  of  the  risk  management  system  and,  in  particular, the permanent control system.\n\nAs  regards  external  factors,  incidents  occurring  in  other credit  institutions  are  monitored  based  on  external  data, leading  when  necessary  to  adjustments  to  the  stress scenarios used in the model.\n\nIn  terms  of  type  of  operational  risk,  Amundi  is  mainly exposed to execution, delivery and process management risk and risk related to clients, products and business practices.\n\nFinally,  concerning  the  large  risk  ratio,  Amundi's  biggest exposure was \u20ac214 million at the end of 2023, in compliance with the 25%  threshold  of  Tier  1  regulatory  capital (CET1+AT1).\n\n- \u00b7 since  1 January  2023,  for  global  systemically  important  banks (G-SIBs), and therefore for the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole group, there has been an additional leverage ratio buffer set at half of the entity's systemic buffer;\n- \u00b7 finally,  non-compliance  with  the  leverage  ratio  buffer requirement  will  result  in  limitations  on  distributions  and calculation of a maximum distributable amount (L-MMD).\n\nSince  1  January  2015,  it  has  been  mandatory  to  publish  the leverage ratio at least once a year.\n\nAmundi's leverage ratio was 20.9% as at 31 December 2023, compared to 19.0% at the end of 2022.\n\n- \u00b7 the minimum leverage ratio requirement is 3%;\n\n| (in \u20ac millions)   | 31/12/2023   | 31/12/2022   |\n|-------------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Tier 1 capital    | 3,100        | 2,623        |\n| Leverage exposure | 13,523       | 13,812       |\n| LEVERAGE RATIO    | 20.9%        | 19.0%        |",

Economic capital is developed in accordance with the interpretation of the main regulatory standards:\n\n- \u00b7 the Basel agreements;\n- \u00b7 CRD  V  transposed  into French  law  by  the  Ordinance  of 21 December 2020;\n- \u00b7 European Banking Authority guidelines;\n\n- \u00b7 the prudential expectations relating to the ICAAP and the ILAAP.\n\nFor each of the risks recorded during the risk identification process,  calculating  economic  capital  requirements  consists of:\n\n- \u00b7 adjusting capital requirements calculated under Pillar 1 so that  internal  capital  reflects  the  risks  of  each  business activity from an economic standpoint;\n- \u00b7 applying  a  quantile  (probability  of  the  occurrence  of  a default)  at  a  defined  level  based  on  the  Group's  risk appetite in terms of external ratings;\n- \u00b7 taking  into  account,  in  a  prudent  manner,  the  effects  of diversification.\n\nIn  addition  to  a  quantitative  aspect,  Amundi's  approach  is also  based  on  a  qualitative  aspect  that  completes  the economic capital requirement measures.\n\n## 5.5 KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS/RISK PROFILE\n\n|                                                                    | 31/12/2023   | 31/12/2022   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|\n| ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT, INCLUDING JOINT VENTURES  (in \u20ac billions) | 2,037        | 1,904        |\n| of which assets under management excluding JV                      | 1,721        | 1,608        |\n| of which, JV AuM                                                   | 316          | 296          |\n| EQUITY, GROUP SHARE  (in \u20ac millions)                               | 11,369       | 11,026       |\n| REGULATORY EQUITY  (in \u20ac millions)                                 | 3,362        | 2,869        |\n| of which Tier 1 capital ( Tier 1 = CET1 + AT1 )                    | 3,100        | 2,623        |\n| of which Common Equity Tier 1  capital (CET1)                      | 3,100        | 2,623        |\n| of which Tier 2 equity                                             | 263          | 246          |\n| TOTAL RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS  (in \u20ac million)                         | 14,261       | 13,712       |\n| of which, Credit risk                                              | 7,626        | 6,753        |\n| of which, Credit risk excl. threshold allowances and CVA           | 5,776        | 5,064        |\n| of which, effect of threshold allowances                           | 1,508        | 1,285        |\n| of which, Credit value adjustment (CVA) effect                     | 342          | 404          |\n| of which, Market risk                                              | 955          | 1,357        |\n| of which, Operational risk                                         | 5,681        | 5,601        |\n| OVERALL SOLVENCY RATIO                                             | 23.6% (1)    | 20.9%        |\n| CET1 RATIO                                                         | 21.7% (1)    | 19.1%        |\n| INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT  (in \u20ac millions)      | 3,760        | 2,435        |\n| of which, Money market                                             | 1,608        | 390          |\n| of which, Fixed income                                             | 1,759        | 1,607        |\n| of which, Equities and multi-asset                                 | 182          | 207          |\n| of which, Other                                                    | 211          | 231          |\n\n- (1) Including the provisioning of the dividend, which will be proposed to the General Shareholders' Meeting on 24 May 2024.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Group employees held 1.4% of the share capital compared with 1.1% previously.\n\n## New tax regulations - Globe\n\nNew  international  tax  rules  have  been  established  by  the OECD, with the aim of imposing additional taxation on large international  groups  when  the  Effective  Tax  Rate  (ETR)  of the jurisdiction in which they are based is below 15%. These rules are designed to prevent countries from competing with each other through tax rates.\n\nThese  rules  must  be  implemented  by  the  various  Member States.\n\nA European Directive was adopted at the end of 2022 (which is  currently  being  transposed  into  national  law  by  the Member States) and stipulates that the GloBE rules will apply in  the  EU  from  financial  year  2024.  At  this  stage,  census work  is  in  progress.  However,  it  is  not  expected  to  have  a significant impact on the Amundi Group.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

This reference is available from the European Commission website at:\n\nhttps://ec.europa.eu/info/business-economy-euro/company-reporting-and-auditing/company-reporting/financial-reporting\\_en\n\n## 1.1.1 Standards applied as at 31 December 2023\n\nThe  accounting  principles  and  methods  chosen  by  Amundi  Group  to  prepare  its  consolidated  financial  statements  as  at 31 December 2023 are identical to those used for the preparation of the consolidated statements for the year ended 31 December 2022, with the exception of the following standards, amendments and interpretations newly applicable to the 2023 fiscal period:\n\n| Standards, amendments and interpretations                                         | Date of publication by the European Union   | Date of first mandatory application for open financial years from   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| IAS 1 Disclosure of accounting methods                                            | 3 March 2022 (EU 2022/357)                  | 1 January 2023                                                      |\n| IAS 8  Accounting estimates                                                       | 3 March 2022 (EU 2022/357)                  | 1 January 2023                                                      |\n| IAS 12  Deferred tax relating to assets and liabilities from the same transaction | 12 August 2022 (EU 2022/1392)               | 1 January 2023                                                      |\n\n## 1.1.2 Standards not yet adopted by the EU\n\nAs at 31 December 2023, the Group has not applied the standards and interpretations published by the IASB and not yet adopted by the European Union. They will not become compulsory until the date set by the European Union and, therefore, the Group has not adopted these as at 31 December 2023.\n\n## 1.2 Presentation format of the financial statements\n\nAmundi  presents  its  balance  sheet  in  decreasing  liquidity order. The assets and liabilities balance sheet is presented in notes 6.2.3. and 6.2.4.\n\nThe income statement is presented, by type, in note 6.2.1.\n\nThe main income statement aggregates are:\n\n- \u00b7 net  income,  including  net  revenues  from  commissions  and other customer activities (note 1.3.6) and net financial income;\n\n## 1.3 Accounting principles and methods\n\n## 1.3.1 Use of assumptions and estimates for the preparation of the financial statements\n\nThe  preparation  of  the  financial  statements  in  accordance with  the  IFRS  accounting  standards  implies  that  the  Group carries  out  a  number  of  estimates  and  retains  certain assumptions it deems realistic and reasonable. The estimates relate  to  the  identification  of  income  and  expenses  and  the valuation of assets and liabilities as well as the information in the notes to the financial statements.\n\nThe exercise assumes that Management applies its judgement based on the information available at the time the statements are prepared. Due to the uncertainties inherent in any valuation process, the Group revises its estimates based on  information  updated  on  a  regular  basis.  It  is  therefore possible that the future results of the operations in question differ from the estimates.\n\nFuture  results  can  indeed  be  impacted  by  a  number  of different factors, notably (but not exclusively):\n\n- \u00b7 the economic and political environment in certain business sectors and countries;\n- \u00b7 the  risks  associated  with  financial  markets,  including changes in the domestic and international markets as well as  fluctuations  in  interest  rates,  exchange  rates,  equities and credit spreads. In line with the sensitivity of managed assets  to  any  variation  in  financial  markets  (equity,  rates, etc.),  this  may  have  an  impact  on  the  Amundi  Group's asset management revenues;\n- \u00b7 changes in regulations and legislation;\n- \u00b7 the risk of non-compliance with regulations and legislation.\n\nThe significant estimates made by the Group to prepare the financial statements relate primarily to:\n\n- \u00b7 assessment  of  the  recoverable  amount  of  goodwill  and other intangible assets (see notes 1.4.6 and 5.13.);\n- \u00b7 general operating expenses;\n- \u00b7 cost of risk (note 1.3.13);\n- \u00b7 the share of net income from equity-accounted entities;\n- \u00b7 net gains or losses on other assets;\n- \u00b7 income tax charges.",

        "page_content": "- \u00b7 the  fair  value  measurement  of  financial  instruments, including  non-consolidated  participating  interests  (see notes 1.3.2 and 7);\n- \u00b7 the  valuation  of  provisions  for  guarantees  granted  to funds;\n- \u00b7 the valuation of provisions for retirement commitments;\n\n## 1.3.2 Financial instruments\n\n## 1.3.2.1 Definitions\n\nIAS  32  defines  a  financial  instrument  as  any  contract  that gives  rise  to  a  financial  asset  in  one  entity  and  a  financial liability  or  equity  instrument  in  another  entity,  i.e.  any contract representing contractual rights or obligations to pay or receive liquid assets or other financial assets.\n\nDerivatives are financial assets and liabilities that derive their value  from  an  underlying,  which  require  little  or  no  initial investment and which are settled at a future date.\n\n- \u00b7 the  valuation  of  provisions  for  legal,  tax,  regulatory  and non-compliance  risks  (please  refer  to  notes  1.3.2.10 and 5.14).\n\nAll  these  assessments  are  carried  out  on  the  basis  of  the information available on the date of establishing the financial statements.\n\nIFRS  9  sets  new  principles  governing  the  classification  and measurement  of  financial  instruments,  impairment  of  credit risk and hedge  accounting, excluding macro-hedging transactions.\n\nPlease  note,  however,  that  Amundi  has  opted  not  to  apply the general IFRS 9 hedging accounting model. Consequently, IAS  39  continues  to  be  applied  to  all  hedging  relationships whilst awaiting future provisions for macro-hedging.\n\nFinancial assets and liabilities are recognised in the financial statements  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  IFRS  9  as adopted by the European Union.\n\n## 1.3.2.2 Bases for measuring financial assets and liabilities\n\n## Initial measurement\n\nUpon  initial  recognition,  financial  assets  and  liabilities  are valued at fair value as defined by IFRS 13.\n\nFair  value  as  defined  by  IFRS  13  is  the  price  that  would  be received  to  sell  an  asset  or  paid  to  transfer  a  liability  in  an orderly  transaction  between  market  participants  at  the measurement  date,  on  the  primary  or  most  advantageous market.\n\n## Subsequent measurement\n\nAfter  initial  recognition,  financial  assets  and  liabilities  are valued based on their classification, either at their amortised cost using the effective interest rate (EIR) method for debt instruments,  or  at  their  fair  value  as  specified  by  IFRS  13. Derivatives are always measured at fair value.\n\n## 1.3.2.3 Financial assets\n\n## Classification and measurement of financial assets\n\nNon-derivative  financial  assets  (debt  or  equity  instruments) are  classified  in  accounting  categories  in  the  financial statements  that  determine  their  accounting  treatment  and their  subsequent  measurement  method.  These  financial assets are classified in one of the following three categories:\n\n- \u00b7 financial assets at fair value through profit or loss;\n\nAmortised cost is the amount at which the financial asset or liability  is  measured  upon  initial  recognition,  including  the transaction costs directly attributable to their acquisition or issue,  less  principal  repayments,  plus  or  minus  accumulated amortisation, calculated using the effective interest rate (EIR) method  for  any  difference  (discount  or  premium)  between the initial amount and the amount at maturity. In the case of a  financial  asset  at  amortised  cost  or  at  fair  value  through recyclable equity, the amount  may  be  adjusted  for impairment losses, if necessary.\n\nThe EIR discounts expected future cash inflows and outflows over  the  expected  life  of  the  financial  instrument  or,  where applicable,  over  a  shorter  period  in  order  to  obtain  the  net book value of the financial asset or liability.\n\n- \u00b7 financial assets at amortised cost (debt instruments only);\n- \u00b7 financial assets at fair value through equity (recyclable for debt instruments, non-recyclable for equity instruments).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

The management  model  is  specified  for  an  asset  portfolio  and does not constitute an intention, on a case-by-case basis, for an isolated financial asset.\n\nThere are three separate management models:\n\n- \u00b7 the  'hold  to  collect'  model  which  aims  to  collect contractual  cash  flows  over  the  life  of  the  assets;  this model does not necessarily mean that all assets are held to contractual maturity, but asset sales are strictly controlled;\n- \u00b7 the 'hold to collect and sell' model which aims to collect cash  flows  over  the  life  of  the  asset  and  to  dispose  of assets;  under  this  model,  the  sale  of  financial  assets  and the receipt of cash are both essential; and\n- \u00b7 the  other/sell  model  whose  primary  objective  is  asset disposal.\n\nThis  model  mainly  relates  to  portfolios  that  aim  to  collect cash  flows via disposals,  portfolios  whose  performance  is measured on the basis of fair value and portfolios of financial assets held for trading.\n\nWhen  the  strategy  pursued  by  the  Management  for managing financial  assets  does  not  match  either  the  'holdto-collect'  model  or  the  'hold-to-collect-and-sell'  model, these financial assets are classified in an other/sell portfolio model.\n\n## Contractual characteristics ('solely payments of principal & interests' or 'SPPI' test)\n\nThe 'SPPI' test combines a series of criteria, examined on a cumulative basis, that make it possible to establish whether the  contractual  cash  flows  have  the  characteristics  of  a simple  financing  arrangement  (payments  of  principal  and interest on the principal outstanding).\n\nThe  test  is  satisfied  when  the  financing  arrangement  gives rise solely to payments of principal and where the payment of  interest  received  reflects  the  time  value  of  money,  the credit  risk  associated  with  the  instrument,  the  other  costs and  risks  of  a  traditional  loan  agreement  as  well  as  a reasonable  margin,  whether  the  interest  rate  is  fixed  or variable.\n\nUnder a simple financing arrangement, the interest represents the cost of time elapsing, the price of credit and liquidity  risk  over  the  period  and  other  components  related to the asset's carrying cost (e.g. administrative costs etc.).\n\nIn some cases, this qualitative analysis is not conclusive and quantitative  analysis  (or  a Benchmark  test )  is  carried  out. This  additional  analysis  consists  of  comparing  contractual cash flows for the asset under consideration and cash flows for a benchmark asset.\n\nIf the difference between the financial asset's cash flows and those  of  the  benchmark  asset  is  deemed  to  be  immaterial, the asset is deemed to be a simple financing arrangement.\n\nIn  addition,  a  specific  analysis  will  be  conducted  if  the financial  asset  was  issued  by  special  purpose  entities establishing  an  order  of  payment  priority  between  financial asset  holders  by  bundling  multiple  instruments  together under  contract  and  creating  credit  risk  concentrations ('tranches').\n\nEach tranche is given a level of subordination which specifies the order of distribution of the cash flows generated by the structured entity.\n\nIn  this  event,  the  SPPI  test  requires  an  analysis  of  the contractual cash flow characteristics of the asset in question and  of  underlying  assets  according  to  the  'look-through' approach  and  of  the  credit  risk  carried  by  the  subscribed tranches  compared  with  the  credit  risk  for  the  underlying assets.\n\nThe debt instrument recognition method arising from qualification of the management model combined with the SPPI test can be presented in the form of the diagram below:\n\n## Management models\n\nDebt instruments\n\nMet\n\nAmortised cost\n\nNot met\n\nFair value through profit or loss\n\nFair value through profit or loss\n\n## Debt instruments at amortised cost\n\nDebt instruments are measured at amortised cost if they are eligible  for  the  hold-to-collect  model  and  if  they  satisfy  the SPPI test.\n\nThey are recorded on the settlement/delivery date and their initial measurement  also  includes  accrued  interest  and transaction costs.\n\nHold-to-collect\n\nHold-to-collect-and-sell\n\nOther/sell\n\nFair value through recyclable equity\n\nFair value through profit or loss\n\nAmortisation of any premiums or discounts and transaction costs on loans and receivables and fixed-income securities is recognised in  profit  or  loss  using  the  effective  interest  rate method.\n\nThis financial asset category is subject to impairment under the  conditions  described  in  the  specific  paragraph  on 'Provisions for credit risks'.\n\nSPPI test",

Although  contractual  cash  flows  are received  during  the  time  that  Amundi  holds  the  assets, receipt of these contractual cash flows is ancillary rather than essential;\n\n- \u00b7 debt  instruments  that  do  not  meet  the  SPPI  test  criteria. This is particularly true of UCIs;\n- \u00b7 financial  instruments  classified  in  portfolios  for  which  the entity  chooses  measurement  at  fair  value  to  lessen  a difference in accounting treatment in the income statement. In this case, classification of fair value through profit or loss is designated as an option.\n\nFinancial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss are  initially  recognised  at  fair  value,  excluding  transaction costs (taken directly to profit or loss) and including accrued interest.\n\nThey are subsequently measured at fair value and changes in fair  value  are  recognised  through  profit  or  loss,  in  net revenues through outstanding assets.\n\nNo impairments are recognised for this category of financial assets.\n\nDebt  instruments  measured  at  fair  value  through  profit  or loss as an option are recorded on the trading date.\n\nDebt  instruments  measured  at  fair  value  through  profit  or loss  that  do  not  satisfy  the  SPPI  test  are  recorded  on  the settlement/delivery date.\n\n## Equity instruments\n\nEquity  instruments  are,  by  default,  recognised  at  fair  value through  profit  or  loss,  apart  from  an  irrevocable  option  of classification at fair value in non-recyclable equity, provided that such instruments are not held for trading purposes.\n\n## Equity instruments at fair value through profit or loss\n\nFinancial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss are  initially  recognised  at  fair  value,  excluding  transaction costs (taken directly to profit or loss). They are recorded on the settlement/delivery date (except equity instruments held for  trading  purposes,  which  are  recorded  on  the  trading date).\n\nThey are subsequently measured at fair value and changes in fair  value  are  recognised  through  profit  or  loss,  in  net revenues through outstanding assets.\n\nNo impairments are recognised for this category of financial assets.\n\n## Equity instruments at fair value through non-recyclable equity (irrevocable option)\n\nThe irrevocable option of recognising equity instruments at fair  value  in  non-recyclable  equity  through  profit  or  loss  is taken  on  a  transactional  level  (line  by  line)  and  is  applied from  the  date  of  initial  recognition.  These  securities  are recorded on the trading date.\n\nThe initial fair value includes transaction costs.\n\nOn  subsequent  measurements,  changes  in  fair  value  are recognised in non-recyclable equity. In the event of disposal, these  changes  are  not  recycled  through  profit  or  loss,  the gain or loss on the disposal is recognised in equity.\n\nOnly dividends are recognised through profit or loss.\n\n## Derecognition of financial assets\n\nA  financial  asset  (or  group  of  financial  assets)  is  fully  or partially derecognised if:\n\n- \u00b7 the contractual rights to the related cash flows expire;\n- \u00b7 or  are  transferred  or  deemed  to  have  expired  or  been transferred because they belong de facto to one or more beneficiaries  and  if  almost  all  of  the  risks  and  benefits  of ownership of the financial asset are transferred.\n\nIn  this  case,  any  rights  or  obligations  created  or  retained at  the  time  of  transfer  are  recognised  separately  as  assets and liabilities.\n\nIf the contractual rights to the cash flows are transferred, but only some of the risks and rewards of ownership as well as control are retained, the entity will continue to recognise the financial asset to the extent of its involvement in the asset.\n\nFinancial  assets  renegotiated  for  commercial  reasons  in  the absence of financial difficulties by the counterparty and with the  aim  of  building  or  retaining  a  business  relationship  are derecognised on the renegotiation date. New loans to clients are  recorded  on  that  date  at  their  fair  value  on  the renegotiation date. Subsequent recognition is dependent on the management model and the SPPI test.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

No subsequent reclassification is authorised.\n\n## 1.3.2.5 Provisions for credit risk\n\n## Scope of application\n\nIn  accordance with IFRS 9, Amundi recognises impairments under 'expected credit losses' (ECL) for outstanding assets on the following:\n\n- \u00b7 financial  assets  that  are  debt  instruments  recognised  at amortised cost or at fair value in recyclable equity (loans and receivables, debt securities);\n\n## Distinction between liabilities and equity\n\nThe  distinction  between  debt  instruments  and  equity instruments  is  based  on  an  analysis  of  the  substance  of contractual arrangements.\n\nA  financial  liability  is  a  debt  instrument  if  it  includes  a contractual obligation:\n\n- \u00b7 to return cash, other financial assets or a variable number of equity instruments to another entity; or\n- \u00b7 to  exchange  financial  assets  and  liabilities  with  another entity under potentially unfavourable conditions.\n\nAn equity instrument is a non-repayable financial instrument that  provides  a  discretionary  return  which  highlights  a residual interest in a company after deduction of all financial liabilities  (net  assets)  and  which  is  not  qualified  as  a  debt instrument.\n\n## Buyback of treasury shares\n\nThe treasury shares purchased by Amundi, including shares held for hedging the performance share allocation plans, do not  fall  within  the  definition  of  a  financial  asset  and  are recognised as a deduction from the equity. They do not have any impact on the income statement.\n\n## Derecognition and modification of financial liabilities\n\nA financial liability is derecognised in full or in part:\n\n- \u00b7 when it is extinguished; or\n- \u00b7 when quantitative or qualitative analyses conclude that it has undergone a substantial change following restructuring.\n\nSubstantial modification of an existing financial liability must be  recorded  as  the  extinction  of  the  initial  financial  liability and the recognition of a new financial liability (the novation). Any difference between the carrying amount of the liability that  has  been  extinguished  and  the  new  liability  will  be recorded immediately in the income statement.\n\nIf the  financial  liability  has  not  been  derecognised,  the original effective interest rate continues. A discount/premium is immediately recognised through profit or loss on the date of  the  modification  and  is  then  apportioned  at  the  original effective  interest  rate  over  the  remaining  life  of  the instrument.\n\n- \u00b7 guarantee commitments covered by IFRS 9 and which are not measured at fair value through profit or loss.\n\nEquity instruments (at fair value through profit or loss or at fair value  in  non-recyclable  OCI)  are  not  affected  by impairment provisions.\n\nCounterparty  risk  is  calculated  for  derivatives  and  other instruments at fair value through profit or loss which is not pursuant to the ECL model.",

        "page_content": "## Credit risk and provisioning stages\n\nCredit risk is defined as the risk of losses associated with the default  of  a  counterparty  leading  to  its  inability  to  meet  its commitments to the Group.\n\nThe  credit  risk  provisioning  process  distinguishes  between three different stages ( Buckets or Stages ):\n\n- \u00b7 Stage  1  ( Bucket 1):  from  the  initial  recognition  of  the financial instrument (credit, debt security, guarantee etc.), the entity recognises 12-month expected credit losses;\n- \u00b7 Stage  2  ( Bucket 2):  if  the  credit  quality  deteriorates significantly for a given transaction or portfolio, the entity recognises  the  expected  losses  to  maturity  (ECL  to maturity);\n- \u00b7 Stage 3 ( Bucket 3): when one or more default events occur in respect of the transaction or the counterparty and have a  damaging  effect  on  estimated  future  cash  flows,  the entity recognises  objective  evidence  of  impairment. Subsequently,  if  the  conditions  for  classifying  financial instruments  in Bucket 3  are  not  met,  the  financial instruments are reclassified  in Bucket 2,  then  in Bucket 1, depending on the  subsequent  improvement  in  credit  risk quality.\n\n## Definition of default\n\nThe definition of default for the requirements of provisioning for  ECLs  is  identical  to  that  used  in  management  and  for calculating regulatory ratios. A debtor is thus considered to be  in  default  when  at  least  one  of  the  following  two conditions has been met:\n\n- \u00b7 significant payment arrears generally in excess of 90 days unless special circumstances show that the arrears are due to reasons unrelated to the debtor's situation;\n- \u00b7 the  entity  deems  it  unlikely  that  the  debtor  will  settle  its credit obligations in full without recourse to measures such as the provision of surety.\n\nAn  outstanding  asset  in  default  ( Bucket 3)  is  said  to  be impaired when one or more events have occurred that have a harmful effect on this financial asset's estimated future cash flows.  Signs  of  a  financial  asset's  impairment  include observable data on the following events:\n\n- \u00b7 major financial difficulties experienced by the issuer or the borrower;\n- \u00b7 a breach of contract, such as failed or late payment;\n- \u00b7 the  granting  of  one  or  more  favours  by  one  or  more lenders  to  the  borrower  for  economic  or  contractual reasons relating to the borrower's financial difficulties that the  lender  or  lenders  would  not  have  envisaged  under other circumstances;\n- \u00b7 the  increasing  probability  of  the  failure  or  financial restructuring of the borrower;\n- \u00b7 the  disappearance  of  an  active  market  for  the  financial asset due to financial difficulties;\n- \u00b7 the  purchase  or  creation  of  a  financial  asset  with  a  big discount, which reflects the credit losses suffered.\n\nIt  is  not  necessarily possible to single out a particular event since the impairment of the financial asset may be the result of the combined effect of several events.\n\n## The concept of expected credit loss (ECL)\n\nECL  is  defined  as  the  probability-weighted  estimate  of discounted credit loss (principal and interest). It is the actual value of the difference between contractual cash flows and expected cash flows (principal and interest).\n\nThe ECL approach aims to allow expected credit losses to be recognised as early as possible.\n\n## Governance and measurement of ECLs\n\nGovernance  of  the  system  used  to  measure  IFRS  9 parameters is based on the organisation put in place under the Basel framework.  The  Group's  Risk  Management Department  is  responsible  for  defining  the  methodological framework and oversight of the system of asset provisioning.\n\nThe Group prioritises the internal rating system and current Basel  processes  when  generating  the  IFRS  9  parameters needed to calculate ECLs. Assessment of the change in credit risk  is  based  on  an  expected  loss  model  and  extrapolation based  on  reasonable  scenarios.  All  available,  relevant, reasonable  and  supportable  information  must  be  used, including forward-looking information.\n\nThe  calculation  formula  incorporates  the  parameters  of probability  of  default,  loss  in  the  event  of  default  and exposure at the time of default.\n\nThese  calculations  are  based  on  internal  models  applied within  a  regulatory  framework  where  this  exists,  but  with restatements  to  determine  an  economic  ECL.  IFRS  9 recommends a point-in-time analysis while taking account of historic loss data and forward-looking macroeconomic data, whilst the prudential viewpoint is analysed through the cycle for the probability of default and at the lowest point of the cycle (downturn) for losses in the event of default.\n\nThis accounting approach also results in the recalculation of certain Basel parameters to neutralise internal recovery costs or  the  floors  imposed  by  the  regulator  in  the  regulatory calculation of loss given default (LGD).\n\nECL  calculation  methods  must  be  assessed  according  to product  type:  financial  instruments  and  off-balance  sheet instruments.\n\n12-month expected credit losses are a portion of the lifetime expected credit losses and represent the cash flow shortfalls caused by default within 12 months of the reporting date (or a  shorter  period  if  the  financial  instrument's  lifetime  is expected  to  be  less  than  12  months),  weighted  by  the probability of default within the 12 months.\n\nExpected  credit  losses  are  discounted  using  the  EIR determined at the financial instrument's initial recognition.\n\nECL  measurement  methods  take  into  account  the  assets assigned as collateral and other credit enhancements that are part  of  the  contractual  terms  and  that  the  entity  does  not recognise  separately.  The  estimated  cash  flow  shortfalls expected  from  a  secured  financial  instrument  reflects  the amount  and  the  timing  for  recovering  the  collateral.  In accordance with IFRS 9,  the  recognition  of  guarantees  and collateral  does  not  affect  the  assessment  of  the  significant deterioration in credit risk: this is based on changes in credit risk on the debtor without taking into account guarantees.\n\nThe  models  and  parameters  used  are  back-tested  at  least once a year.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

This assessment of the change in credit  risk  leads  entities  to  categorise  their  transactions  by risk rating ( Buckets ).\n\nTo  assess  significant  deterioration,  the  Group  operates  a process based on two levels of analysis:\n\n- \u00b7 an initial level depending on Group rules and relative and absolute criteria imposed on Group entities;\n- \u00b7 a second level relating to the assessment, certified by an expert for local Forward Looking data,  of  the  risk  carried by each entity on its portfolios that may lead the Group to adjust its criteria for downgrading to Bucket 2 (portfolio or sub-portfolio switching to ECL at maturity).\n\nAll  financial  instruments,  save  for  some  exceptions,  are monitored  for  significant  deterioration.  No  contagion  is required  to  switch  financial  instruments  from  the  same outstanding from Bucket 1 to Bucket 2. Monitoring significant deterioration  must  take  account  of  changes  to  the  main debtor's credit risk, without taking account of the warranty.\n\nFor outstanding assets comprising small loans and receivables with similar characteristics, the counterparty-bycounterparty  review  may  be  replaced  by  a  statistical estimate of expected losses.\n\nTo measure significant deterioration in credit risk since initial recognition,  it  is  necessary  to  recover  the  initial  internal rating and PD (probability of default).\n\nThe date of origination is understood to be the trading date, when the entity becomes party to the contractual provisions of  the  financial  instrument.  For  financing  and  guarantee commitments, the date of origination is understood to be the irrevocable commitment date.\n\nFor  outstanding  assets  (other  than  securities)  for  which internal rating systems have been constructed (in particular, exposures monitored using authorised methods), the Amundi Group considers that all the information incorporated in such rating  systems  allows  for  a  more  relevant  assessment  than the sole criterion of payments more than 30 days past due.\n\nIf the deterioration since the date of origination ceases to be recorded, the impairment may return to 12-month expected credit losses ( Bucket 1).\n\nTo  compensate  for  the  fact  that  some  factors  or  signs  of significant  deterioration  cannot  be  identified  at  the  level  of an individual financial instrument, the standard authorises the assessment of significant deterioration for portfolios, groups of portfolios or portions of portfolios of financial instruments.\n\n## 1.3.2.6 Financial derivatives\n\n## Classification and measurement\n\nDerivatives  are  financial  assets  or  liabilities  classified,  by default, as derivative instruments held for trading, unless they can be classified as derivative hedging instruments.\n\nThey  are  recorded  in  the  balance  sheet  at  their  initial  fair value on the trading date.\n\nThey are subsequently measured at fair value.\n\nThe  construction  of  portfolios  to  assess  deterioration  on  a collective basis may result in common characteristics such as:\n\n- \u00b7 the type of instrument;\n- \u00b7 the credit risk rating (including the internal Basel II rating for entities with an internal rating system);\n- \u00b7 the type of collateral;\n- \u00b7 the initial recognition date;\n- \u00b7 the remaining term to maturity;\n- \u00b7 the value of collateral relative to the financial asset, if it has an  impact  on  the  probability  of  a  default  occurring  (for example, non-recourse loans in some jurisdictions or loanto-value ratios).\n\nGroupings  of  financial  instruments  for  the  purpose  of assessing  changes  in  credit  risk  on  a  collective  basis  may change over time as new information becomes available.\n\nFor  securities,  Amundi  uses  an  approach  that  consists  of applying an absolute level of credit risk in  accordance with IFRS  9,  beyond  which  exposures  are  classified  in Bucket 2 and provisioned on the basis of ECL at maturity.\n\nThe  following  rules  will  apply  for  monitoring  the  significant deterioration of securities:\n\n- \u00b7 securities  ranked  as  'Investment  Grade'  securities  on  the closing date, will be classified in Bucket 1  and provisioned on the basis of a 12-month ECL;\n- \u00b7 securities ranked as 'Non-Investment Grade' (NIG) securities,  on  the  closing  date,  must  be  monitored  for significant deterioration, since the date of origination, and be classified in Bucket 2 (ECL at maturity) in the event of a significant deterioration in credit risk.\n\nRelative  deterioration  must  be  assessed  upstream  of  the occurrence of a proven default ( Bucket 3)..\n\n## Non-recoverability\n\nWhen a receivable is deemed to be irrecoverable, i.e. there is no  hope  of  recovering  all,  or  part,  of  the  receivable,  the amount  deemed  to  be  irrecoverable  must  be  derecognised and written off.\n\nAssessment of the time taken to write the receivable off is based on expert judgement. Each entity must set the writeoff  time  with  the  Risk  Management  Department,  depending on how much information it has on its business. Prior to any write-offs, Bucket 3 provisioning must be made (apart from financial assets at fair value through profit or loss).\n\nFor  loans  at  amortised  cost  or  at  fair  value  in  recyclable equity, the amount written off is recorded under cost of risk for  the  principal  and  under  net  financial  income  for  the interest.\n\nOn  every  reporting  date,  any  change  in  the  fair  value  of derivatives on the balance sheet is recorded:\n\n- \u00b7 in  profit  or  loss  for  derivatives  held-for-trading  or  as  fair value hedges;\n- \u00b7 in equity if these are derivatives used to hedge cash flows or a net investment in a foreign operation, for the effective portion of the hedge.",

The eligibility of financial instruments for hedge accounting under IAS 39 takes into consideration IFRS 9 principles governing the classification and measurement of financial instruments.\n\nUnder  IFRS  9,  and  in  consideration  of  IAS  39  hedging principles,  debt  instruments  at  amortised  cost  and  at  fair value in recyclable equity are eligible for fair value hedging and cash flow hedging.\n\n## Documentation\n\nHedging  relationships  must  comply  with  the  following principles:\n\n- \u00b7 The aim of fair value hedges is to protect against exposure to  changes  in  the  fair  value  of  a  recognised  asset  or  a liability  or  an  unrecognised  firm  commitment,  due  to  the risk(s)  hedged  and  which  may  affect  the  net  income  (for example, hedging of all or some changes in fair value due to interest rate risk on a fixed-rate debt).\n- \u00b7 Cash flow hedging is intended to provide protection from exposure  to  future  changes  in  cash  flows  from  a recognised  asset  or  liability  or  a  transaction  that  is considered  to  be  highly  likely,  attributable  to  the  risk(s) hedged  and  which  could  (in  the  case  of  a  forecast transaction that has not yet been performed) affect the net income  (for  example,  hedging  of  changes  in  all  or  some future interest payments on a floating-rate debt).\n- \u00b7 Hedging  of  a  net  investment  in  a  foreign  operation  is intended to provide protection from the risk of an adverse movement in fair value arising from the foreign exchange risks  associated  with  a  foreign  investment  in  a  currency other than the euro which is Amundi's reporting currency.\n\nHedges must also meet the following criteria in order to be eligible for hedge accounting:\n\n- \u00b7 the  eligibility  of  the  hedging  instrument  and  the  hedged instrument;\n- \u00b7 there  must  be  formal  documentation  from  inception, including the individual identification and characteristics of the  hedged  item  and  of  the  hedging  instrument,  the nature  of  the  hedging  relationship  and  the  type  of  risk hedged;\n- \u00b7 the  effectiveness  of  the  hedge  must  be  demonstrated  at inception and, retrospectively, by testing at each reporting date.\n\nFor  interest  rate  hedges  for  financial  asset  or  liability portfolios, the Amundi Group favours documentation of fair\n\nvalue  hedging  as  permitted  under  IAS  39  adopted  by  the European Union ( carve out version). In particular:\n\n- \u00b7 the  Group  documents these hedging relationships on the basis  of  the  gross  position  of  derivatives  and  hedged items;\n- \u00b7 the effectiveness of these hedging  relationships is evidenced by means of timelines.\n\n## Measurement\n\nThe  change  in  value  of  the  derivative  at  its  fair  value  is recognised as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 fair  value  hedge:  the  change  in  value  of  the  derivative  is recognised in profit or loss symmetrically with the change in value of the hedged item in the amount of the hedged risk. Only the net amount of any ineffective portion of the hedge is recognised in profit or loss;\n- \u00b7 cash  flow  hedge:  the  change  in  value  of  the  derivative, excluding  accrued  and  due  interest,  is  recognised  in  the balance  sheet  through  a  specific  account  in  gains  and losses  recognised  directly  in  recyclable  equity  for  the effective portion, and any ineffective portion of the hedge is recognised in profit or loss. Any profits or losses on the derivative  accrued  through  equity  are  then  recycled  in profit or loss when the hedged cash flows occur;\n- \u00b7 hedges  of  a  net  investment  in  a  foreign  operation:  the change  in  value  of  the  derivative  is  recognised  in  the balance sheet through the currency translation adjustments  in  recyclable  equity  and  any  ineffective portion of the hedge is recognised in profit or loss.\n\nWhen the conditions  for  benefiting  from  hedge  accounting are no longer met, the following accounting treatment must be applied prospectively:\n\n- \u00b7 fair value hedge: only the hedging instrument continues to be  revalued  through  profit  or  loss.  The  hedged  item  is wholly recognised according to its classification. For debt instruments at fair value in equity recyclable through profit or loss, changes in fair value subsequent to the end of the hedging  relationship  are  recorded,  in  full,  in  equity.  For hedged items valued at amortised cost which were interest rate hedges, the revaluation surplus is amortised over the remaining life of those hedged items;\n- \u00b7 cash flow hedge: the hedging instrument is valued at fair value through profit or loss. The amounts accumulated in equity under the effective portion of the hedge remain in equity  until  the  hedged  element  affects  net  income.  For interest rate hedged items, net income is allocated through the  payment  of  interest.  The  revaluation  surplus  is therefore  amortised  over  the  remaining  life  of  those hedged items;\n- \u00b7 hedging  of  a  net  investment  in  a  foreign  operation:  the amounts accumulated in equity in respect of the effective portion  of  the  hedging  remain  in  equity  while  the  net investment  is  held.  The  net  income  is  recorded  once  the net investment in the foreign operation exits the reporting entities.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

It is presented using the hierarchy defined by IFRS 13.\n\nIFRS 13 defines fair value as the price that would be received to  sell  an  asset  or  paid  to  transfer  a  liability  in  an  orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date,  on  the  primary  market  or  on  the  most  advantageous market.\n\nFair  value  applies  individually  to  each  financial  asset  and financial  liability.  It  can,  exceptionally,  be  estimated  by portfolio  if  the  management  and  risk  monitoring  strategy allow and if appropriately documented. Accordingly, certain fair  value  parameters  are  calculated  on  a  net  basis  when  a group of financial  assets  and  financial  liabilities  is  managed on the basis of its net exposure to market or credit risks. This is  particularly  the  case  for  the  calculation  of  CVA  /  DVA ( Credit  Valuation Adjustment)  and  DVA  ( Debit  Valuation Adjustment ).\n\nAmundi  believes  that  quoted  prices  published  in  an  active market are the best evidence of fair value.\n\nWhen  such  quoted  prices  are  not  available,  fair  value  is established by using valuation techniques that maximise the use  of  relevant  observable  data  and  minimise  the  use  of unobservable data.\n\n## Fair value of structured issues\n\nIn  accordance  with  IFRS  13,  Amundi  values  its  structured issues by integrating the issue spread of the guarantor.\n\n## Counterparty risk on derivative instruments\n\nIn application of IFRS 13, Amundi incorporates into fair value the  assessment  of  counterparty  risk  for  derivative  assets (CVA)  and,  using  a  symmetrical  treatment,  the  nonperformance risk for derivative liabilities (DVA or own credit risk).\n\nCVA makes it possible to determine expected counterparty losses from Amundi's perspective. DVA makes it possible to determine expected losses on Amundi from the counterparty's perspective.\n\nFor  derivatives  carried  out  with  market  counterparties,  the CVA/DVA calculation  is  based  on  an  estimate  of  expected losses given the probability of default and loss in the event of default.  The  methodology  used  maximises  the  use  of observable  market  data.  It  is  primarily  based  on  market parameters such as registered and listed CDS ( Credit Default Swap )  or CDS Single Name or  Index  CDS in the absence of named  counterparty  CDS.  Under  certain  circumstances, historical default parameters may also be used.\n\nNo CVA/DVA is calculated either for derivatives contracted by Amundi or for funds, taking into account that there is no historical  default  data  and  the  guarantee  provided  by Amundi to the funds.\n\n## Fair value hierarchy\n\nThe standard classifies  fair  value  into  three  levels  based  on the observability of inputs used in valuation techniques.\n\n## Level 1: fair value corresponding to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets\n\nLevel 1 is composed of financial instruments that are directly quoted  in  active  markets  for  identical  assets  and  liabilities that  the  entity  can  access  at  the  measurement  date.  These are  stocks  and  bonds  listed  on  active  markets,  shares  in investment  funds  listed  on  active  markets  and  derivatives traded on organised markets, in particular futures.\n\nA market is deemed to be active if quoted prices are readily and  regularly  available  from  an  exchange,  broker,  dealer, pricing service or regulatory agency, and the prices represent actual  and  regularly  occurring  market  transactions  under normal competitive conditions.\n\nFor financial assets and liabilities with offsetting market risks, Amundi uses mid-prices as the basis for establishing the fair value  of  the  positions.  The  current  bid  price  is  applied  to assets held or liabilities to be issued (open long position) and the current asking price to assets to be acquired or liabilities held (open short position).\n\n## Level 2: fair value measured using directly or indirectly observable inputs other than those in Level 1\n\nThis  data  is  directly  observable  (i.e.  prices)  or  indirectly observable  (data  derived  from  prices)  and  generally  meets the  following  criteria:  this  is  data  not  specific  to  the  entity, which is publicly available/accessible and based on a market consensus.\n\nLevel 2 consists of:\n\n- \u00b7 stocks and bonds listed on an inactive market or unlisted on an active market, but for which fair value is established using a valuation methodology habitually used by market participants  (such  as  the  method  of  discounting  future cash flows or the Black & Scholes method) and based on observable market data;\n- \u00b7 instruments  traded  over  the  counter,  the  fair  value  of which  is  measured  with  models  using  observable  market data,  i.e.  which  can  be  obtained  from  several  sources independent  of  internal  sources  on  a  regular  basis.  For example, the fair value of interest rate swaps is generally derived  from  the  yield  curves  of  interest  rates  based  on market interest rates observed on the closing date.\n\nWhen the models used are consistent with standard models and on observable market parameters (such as yield curves or implied volatility ranges), the initial margin generated on the instruments valued in this way is recognised in profit or loss from inception.",

        "page_content": "## Level 3: fair value for which a significant number of the parameters used for determination are not based on observable criteria\n\nIn  the  case  of  some  complex  instruments  which  are  not traded in an active market, fair value measurement is based on valuation techniques that use assumptions not supported by data observable on the market for an identical instrument. These instruments are presented in Level 3.\n\nThese  are  mainly  complex  rate  products,  equity  derivatives and structured credit products whose valuation requires, for example, correlation or volatility parameters that cannot be directly compared to market data.\n\n## 1.3.2.8 Offsetting of financial assets and liabilities\n\nIn  accordance with IAS 32, Amundi offsets a financial asset and  a  financial  liability  and  reports  the  net  balance  if,  and only if it has a legally enforceable right to offset the amounts reported  and  intends  either  to  settle  on  a  net  basis,  or  to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.\n\n## 1.3.2.9 Net gains or losses on financial instruments\n\n## Net gains or losses on financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss\n\nFor financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss, this heading includes the following income statement items:\n\n- \u00b7 dividends  and  other  revenue  from  equities  and  other variable-income securities classified under financial assets at fair value through profit or loss;\n- \u00b7 changes in fair value of financial assets or liabilities at fair value through profit or loss;\n- \u00b7 gains and losses on disposal of financial assets at fair value through profit or loss;\n- \u00b7 changes in fair value and gains and losses on disposal or termination  of  derivatives  not  included  in  a  fair  value hedging relationship or cash flow hedge.\n\nThis heading also includes the ineffective portion of hedging transactions.\n\n## 1.3.2.10 Financial guarantees given\n\nA financial guarantee contract is a contract that requires the issuer  to  make  specified  payments  to  reimburse  the  holder for  a  loss  it  incurs  because  a  specified  debtor  fails  to  make payment when due under the original or amended terms of a debt instrument.\n\nFinancial  guarantee  contracts  are  initially  measured  at  fair value, then subsequently at the higher of:\n\n- \u00b7 the  amount  of  impairment  losses  determined  under  the provisions of IFRS 9, section on 'Impairment'; or\n\nThe initial transaction price is deemed to reflect the market value and recognition of the initial margin is deferred.\n\nThe margin generated on these structured financial instruments  is  generally  recognised  in  profit  or  loss  spread over the period during which the parameters are deemed to be unobservable. When the market data becomes observable, the margin remaining to be spread is immediately recognised in profit or loss.\n\nThe valuation methodologies and models used to value the financial instruments presented in Levels 2 and 3 incorporate all of the factors that market players use to calculate prices. They  must  first  be  validated  by  an  independent  audit. Determination  of  the  fair  value  of  these  instruments  takes into account both the liquidity risk and the counterparty risk.\n\nThe  effect  of  this  offsetting  is  presented  in  table  5.4. concerning  the  amendment  to  IFRS  7  on  disclosures regarding  the  offsetting  of  financial  assets  and  financial liabilities.\n\n## Net gains or losses on financial instruments at fair value through equity\n\nFor financial assets at fair value through equity, this heading includes the following income statement items:\n\n- \u00b7 dividends  from  equity  instruments  classified  as  financial assets at fair value in non-recyclable equity through profit or loss;\n- \u00b7 gains  and  losses  on  disposals  as  well  as  net  income associated with the termination of the hedging relationship on  debt  instruments  classified  as  financial  assets  at  fair value in recyclable equity;\n- \u00b7 net  income  on  disposals  or  termination  of  fair  value hedging  instruments  for  financial  assets  at  fair  value through equity where the item being hedged is sold.\n- \u00b7 the  amount  initially  recognised  less,  where  appropriate, cumulative  revenue  recognised  in  accordance  with  the principles  of  IFRS  15  'Revenue  from  contracts  with customers'.\n\nFor Amundi, the financial guarantees given are funds where capital or performance is guaranteed.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

If  required,  the estimates are discounted when the effect is significant.\n\nThis obligation can be legal, regulatory or contractual. It can also result from the Group's practices or from commitments that  created  a  legitimate  expectation  on  the  part  of  third parties involved that the Group will assume certain liabilities.\n\n## 1.3.4 Employee benefits\n\nThese  are  grouped  into  four  categories  in  accordance  with IAS 19 'Employee benefits':\n\n- \u00b7 short-term benefits such as salaries, social security contributions,  annual  holidays,  incentives,  profit  sharing  and bonuses  are  those  which  are  expected  to  be  paid  within 12  months  following  the  financial  year  during  which  the services were rendered;\n\nIf  no  reliable  evaluation  of  the  amount  can  be  made,  no provisions are recognised, but information is provided in the appendix, where appropriate.\n\nThe  Group  creates  provisions  for  these  obligations  which cover:\n\n- \u00b7 risks related to guarantees granted to funds;\n- \u00b7 operational risks;\n- \u00b7 employee benefits, including retirement commitments;\n- \u00b7 disputes;\n- \u00b7 legal, tax (excluding income tax), regulatory and non -compliance risks.\n- \u00b7 long-term  benefits (long-service awards, bonuses  and compensation payable 12 months or more after the close of the financial year);\n- \u00b7 severance pay;\n- \u00b7 post-employment benefits, falling into one of two categories described below: defined-benefit plans and definedcontribution plans.\n\n## 1.3.4.1 Retirement plans - defined contribution plans\n\nThere are several compulsory retirement plans to which 'employer' companies contribute. Plan assets are managed by independent organisations and the contributing companies have no legal or implied obligation to pay additional contributions if the funds do not have sufficient assets to cover all benefits corresponding to services rendered by the employees during the financial year and during prior years. Consequently, Amundi Group entities have no liabilities in this respect other than their contributions to be paid for the year ended.\n\n## 1.3.4.2 Defined-benefits plans\n\nIn  accordance  with  IAS  19,  the  commitments  are  assessed based  on  a  set  of  actuarial,  financial  and  demographic assumptions and using the Projected Unit Credit method. This method consists of allocating an expense corresponding to the rights  vested  over  the  period  for  each  financial  year  of employment.  The  expense  is  calculated  based  on  the  future, discounted benefit.\n\nThe  calculations  for  expenses  for  future  social  benefits  are made on the basis of assumptions for discount rates, employee turnover and changes in wages and social security contributions developed by Management.\n\nThe discount rates are determined based on the average period of  commitment, that is, the weighted average of the payment dates of future benefits. The underlying index used is the iBoxx AA Index.\n\nIn  accordance  with  IAS  19,  Amundi  allocates  all  actuarial differences recorded in gains and losses recognised directly in non-recyclable equity. Actuarial differences consist of adjustments related to experience (difference between estimated  and  actual  experience)  and  the  effect  of  changes made to the actuarial assumptions.\n\nThe expected yield of plan assets is determined on the basis of  the  discount  rates  used  to  evaluate  the  defined  benefits\n\nobligation.  The  difference  between  the  expected  yield  and the actual yield of plan assets is recorded in gains and losses recognised directly in non-recyclable equity.\n\nThe provision amount is equal to:\n\n- \u00b7 the  current  value  of  the  commitment  for  the  defined benefits on the closing date, calculated using the actuarial method recommended by IAS 19;\n- \u00b7 less,  if  appropriate,  the  fair  value  of  assets  allocated  to hedging the commitments. They can be represented by an eligible insurance policy. In the event that the obligation is fully  hedged  by  a  policy  which  exactly  covers,  in  both amount  and  time,  all  or  part  of  the  benefits  payable  by virtue of the plan, the fair value of the latter is considered to be that of the corresponding obligation (i.e. the amount of the corresponding actuarial debt).\n\nAmundi  has  taken  out  an  'IFC'  insurance  policy  (end-ofcareer  allowance)  with  an  insurance  company  in  the  Cr\u00e9dit Agricole group.\n\nA  provision  to  cover  the  retirement  benefits  is  included  in balance sheet liabilities in the 'Provisions' item for commitments which are not covered.",

        "page_content": "## 1.3.4.3 Long-term benefits\n\nLong-term benefits are benefits which are paid to employees other  than  post-employment  benefits,  severance  payments and equity-based compensation, but which are not due in full during the 12 months following the end of the financial year in  which  the  corresponding  services  were  rendered.  They include,  among  other  things,  bonuses  and  other  deferred compensation paid 12 months or more after the end of the financial year in which they were earned, but which are not indexed to shares.\n\nThe valuation method is similar to that used by the Group for post-employment benefits in the defined-benefits category.\n\nThe  long-term  benefits  which  can  be  granted  by  Amundi consist primarily of the allocation of bonuses whose payment will  be  deferred to future financial years subject to meeting certain performance conditions set in advance and continued employment  at  the  time  of  payment  to  the  employees  to whom they were granted.\n\n## 1.3.5 Non-compliance risk\n\nAmundi  conducts  a  regulated  activity.  As  such,  its  business  is  subject  to  regular  monitoring  and  investigation  by  various regulators. These inspections may reveal certain irregularities and may, in some instances, result in fines or other penalties. The impact of this risk is recorded in the 'Cost of Risk' section of the income statement.\n\n## 1.3.6 Revenue from contracts with customers (IFRS 15)\n\nMost  of  the  Group's  revenue  comes  from  third-party  asset management in collective or individual portfolios (dedicated funds  or  mandates).  It  is  essentially  based  on  the  assets under management in managed funds.\n\nThe net fees comprise net management fees which are equal to  the  gross  management  fees  received  after  deduction  of fees paid:\n\n- \u00b7 the  gross  management  fees  compensate  the  portfolio management  services.  They  are  primarily  calculated  by reference  to  a  percentage  of  the  outstanding  amounts managed;\n- \u00b7 the fees paid are composed of:\n- i) contractual  retrocessions  paid  to  distributors.  These generally correspond to a percentage of the management fees,\n- ii) custodian  and  valuation  agent  fees,  where  these  are paid  by  the  asset  management  company,  as  well  as  a limited number of associated administrative costs such as the ETF listing fees.\n\nNet fees are also composed of:\n\n- \u00b7 fees paid to Amundi for the guarantee given to guaranteed funds  or  structured  EMTNs.  Various  costs  connected  to the formation and the life of structured products are added to these fees;\n- \u00b7 transfer fees paid by the fund in respect of the execution of sales and purchases of securities on behalf of funds by the Amundi trading desk;\n- \u00b7 other  fees  for  lower  amounts,  such  as:  entry  fees, compensation  for  consulting  services,  borrowing  and lending  securities  fees,  account  maintenance  fees  for Employee Savings Plans.\n\nPerformance  fees  are  paid  to  the  asset  management company as provided by contract. They are calculated on the basis of a percentage of the positive difference between the observed performance of the fund and the benchmark index mentioned in the contract.\n\nIncome and expenses for fees are recorded in profit or loss according to the nature of the services they represent. Their recognition on the income statement must reflect the rate at which control of the goods or services sold is transferred to the customer:\n\nNet  income  from  a  transaction  associated  with  a  service provision is recognised under Fees upon transfer of control of the service provided to the customer, if this can be reliably estimated.  Said  transfer  may  be  made  as  the  service  is rendered  (ongoing  service)  or  on  a  given  date  (one-off service).\n\n- i) Fees remunerating ongoing services (management fees, for example) are recorded in profit or loss according to the stage of completion of the service provided.\n- ii) Fees received or paid for one-off services are recorded, in full, in profit or loss when the service is provided.\n\nThe  fees  payable  or  receivable  contingent  upon  meeting  a performance target are recognised only if all of the following conditions are met:\n\n- i) the amount of fees and commissions can be estimated reliably;\n- ii) it is probable  that  the  future  economic  benefits resulting  from  the  services  rendered  will  flow  to  the Company;\n- iii) the stage of completion of the service can be reliably estimated,  and  the  costs  incurred  for  the  service  and the costs to complete it can be reliably estimated.\n\nThese  performance  fees  are,  therefore,  recognised  in  the majority of cases in profit or loss at the end of the calculation period.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

The standard is applicable to transactions carried out for employees, and specifically:\n\n- \u00b7 transactions whose payment is based on shares and paid in equity instruments;\n- \u00b7 transactions whose payment is based on shares and paid in cash.\n\nTwo plans in the Amundi Group are covered by IFRS 2:\n\n- \u00b7 share-based payment plans initiated by the Amundi Group of the type where settlement is made by awarding equity instruments (allocating performance shares);\n- \u00b7 share awards are measured at fair value at the time of the award. They are recognised in expenses under 'personnel expenses' through an equity account over the acquisition period of the rights.\n\n## 1.3.8 Current and deferred tax assets\n\nIn  accordance with IAS 12, the income tax expense includes all income-related taxes, whether current or deferred.\n\n## Current tax\n\nIAS 12 defines current tax liability as 'the amount of income tax payable (recoverable) with respect to the taxable profit (tax  loss)  for  a  financial  year'.  The  taxable  income  is  the profit (or loss) for a given financial year measured according to  the  rules  set  by  the  taxation  authorities  and  based  on which income tax must be paid (recovered).\n\nThe applicable rates and rules used to determine the current tax liability  are  those  in  effect  in  each  country  in  which  the Group's companies are established.\n\nA tax consolidation group has been set up for French entities (since 1 January 2010), with Amundi S.A. as the head of the Group.\n\nThe current tax liability includes all taxes on income, payable or recoverable, for which payment is not subordinated to the completion of future transactions, even if payment is spread over several financial years. The current tax liability must be recognised as a liability until it is paid. If the amount that has already been paid for the current year and previous financial years  exceeds  the  amount  due  for  these  years,  the  surplus must be recognised under assets.\n\nWhen tax credits on revenues from securities portfolios and receivables  are  effectively  used  to  pay  corporation  tax  due for  the  financial  year,  they  are  recognised  under  the  same heading as the income with which they are associated. The corresponding tax charge continues to be recognised under the 'Income tax' heading in the income statement.\n\nMoreover, certain transactions carried out by the entity may have  tax  consequences  that  are  not  taken  into  account  in measuring the current tax liability. IAS 12 defines differences between the carrying amount of an asset or liability and its tax base as temporary differences.\n\nWhen  the  award  takes  place  after  the  services  have  been delivered,  Amundi  carries  out  a  valuation  of  the  services provided  by  the  beneficiaries.  The  expense  is  recognised over the period during which these services were provided;\n\n- \u00b7 Amundi  and  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  SA  share  subscriptions  are made  available  to  employees  as  part  of  the  Company Savings  Plan.  They  are  also  covered  by  the  provisions  of IFRS 2. The shares are offered with a maximum discount of 30%. The plans have no vesting period, but include a fiveyear  lock-up  period.  Employees  are  entitled  to  a  benefit calculated as the difference between the fair value of the share acquired on the allocation date and the award value paid by the employee on the subscription date, multiplied by the number of shares subscribed.\n\nThe expense for the share allocation plan settled by Amundi and Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  SA  equity  instruments  is  recognised  as personnel  expenses  through  an  increase  in  'Consolidated reserves - Group share'.\n\n## Deferred taxes\n\nThe standard requires  that  deferred  taxes  be  recognised  in the following cases:\n\nA  deferred  tax  liability  must  be  recognised  for  all  taxable temporary  differences  between  the  carrying  amount  of  an asset or liability on the balance sheet and its tax base, unless the deferred tax liability arises from:\n\n- \u00b7 initial recognition of goodwill;\n- \u00b7 initial recognition of an asset or a liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and that does not affect either the  accounting  or  the  taxable  profit  (tax  loss)  on  the transaction date.\n\nA  deferred  tax  asset  must  be  recognised  for  all  deductible temporary  differences  between  the  carrying  amount  of  an asset or liability on the balance sheet and its tax base, insofar as  it  is  deemed  likely  that  a  future  taxable  profit  will  be available against which such deductible temporary differences can be allocated.\n\nA  deferred  tax  asset  must  also  be  recognised  for  carrying forward  unused  tax  losses  and  tax  credits  insofar  as  it  is probable  that  the  Group  will  have  access  to  future  taxable profits  against  which  the  unused  tax  losses  and  tax  credits can be allocated.\n\nThe  tax  rates  applicable  in  each  country  are  used  as appropriate.\n\nCalculation  of  deferred  taxes  takes  the  tax  rates  of  each country  into  account  and  should  not  be  discounted  in accordance with IAS 12.\n\nTaxable unrealised gains on securities (FCP - mutual funds in France) do not generate any taxable temporary differences between the carrying amount of the asset and the tax base. As a result, deferred tax is not recognised on these gains.",

Accordingly, unrealised gains recognised at the end of the financial year generate a temporary difference requiring the recognition of deferred tax on this share, in so far as Amundi considers the disposal of the securities likely.\n\nAs part of IFRS 16 'Leasing contracts', a deferred tax liability is recognised on the right of use and a deferred tax asset on the lease liability for leasing contracts for which the Group is lessee.\n\nCurrent and deferred tax is recognised in net income for the financial year, unless the tax arises from:\n\n- \u00b7 either a transaction or event recognised directly in equity, during  the  same  year  or  during  another  financial  year,  in which case it is directly debited or credited to equity;\n- \u00b7 or by a business combination.\n\nDeferred  tax  assets  and  liabilities  offset  each  other  if,  and only if:\n\n- \u00b7 the entity has a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets and liabilities;\n- \u00b7 and the deferred tax assets and liabilities concern income tax assessed by the same tax authority:\n- i) either for the same taxable entity,\n- ii) or  for  different  taxable  entities  that  intend  either  to settle current income tax assets and liabilities on a net basis,  or  to  settle  their  tax  assets  and  liabilities  at  the same time during each future financial year in which it is expected  that  substantial  deferred  tax  assets  or liabilities will be paid or recovered.\n\n## 1.3.9 Property, plant and equipment\n\nAmundi  applies  component  accounting  to  all  its  tangible fixed assets.

IFRIC 23 'Uncertainty over income tax treatments' applies as soon  as  an  entity  has  identified  one  or  more  uncertainties over  income  tax  treatments  undertaken  with  regard  to  its\n\ntaxes.

        "page_content": "## 1.3.14 Lease\n\nThe  Amundi  Group  holds  leasing  contracts  primarily  as  a lessee.\n\nLease transactions are recognised in the balance sheet on the date  of  availability  of  the  leased  assets.  The  lessee  accounts for an asset that is representative of the right to use the leased asset in the tangible fixed assets during the estimated term of the contract and a debt owed under an obligation to pay the rents in the various liabilities over the same term.\n\nThe term of lease corresponds to the non-cancellable term of the  leasing  contract  adjusted  by  the  contract  extension options that the lessee is reasonably likely to exercise and the termination  option  that  the  lessee  is  reasonably  likely  not  to exercise.\n\nIn  France,  the  Group  principle  applicable  to  open-ended  or automatically  renewable  contracts  is  to  use  the  first  exit option after five years. The term used for the so-called '3/6/9' commercial leases is generally nine years with an initial noncancellable  period  of  three  years.  When  the  lessee  deems  it reasonably certain that it will not exercise the exit option after three  years,  the  Group  principle  will  be  applied  to  French commercial  leases  in  most  cases,  on  the  leasing  contract commencement  date.  This  means  that  the  term  will  be estimated  at  six  years.  The  Group  principle  (first  exit  option after  five  years)  may  not  be  applied  in  some  specific  cases, such as for a lease where intermediate exit options have been waived (for example, through a rent reduction). In such cases, an initial  lease term of nine years will apply (generally unless an automatic extension of up to three years is expected).\n\nThe  lease  liability  is  recognised  at  an  amount  equal  to  the present  value  of  the  rent  payments  over  the  term  of  the contract.  Rent  payments  include  fixed  rents,  variable  rents based  on  a  rate  or  index,  and  payments  that  the  lessee expects  to  make  as  residual  value  guarantees,  a  purchase option or as an early termination penalty.\n\nVariable rents that do not depend on an index or a rate and the non-deductible VAT on rents are excluded from the debt calculation and are recognised as general operating expenses.\n\nThe discount rate applicable for calculating the right of use and  the  rental  liability  is,  by  default,  the  lessee's  marginal debt  ratio  over  the  term  of  the  contract  on  the  date  of signature of the contract when the implicit rate cannot easily be calculated. The marginal debt ratio takes account of the rental payment structure.\n\nThe expense of the leasing contracts is partly comprised of interest and partly of capital amortisation.\n\nThe right to use the asset is valued at the initial value of the lease liability, plus the initial direct costs, advance payments and refurbishment costs. It is  amortised  over  the  estimated term of the contract.\n\nThe lease liability and the right of use may be adjusted in the event  of  an  amendment  to  the  leasing  contract,  a reassessment of the lease term or a rent review linked to the application of indices or rates.\n\nDeferred  taxes  are  recognised  on  the  basis  of  timing differences between the rights to use and the lessee's rental liabilities.\n\nIn  accordance  with  the  exception  set  out  in  the  standard, short-term  leasing  contracts  (an  initial  term  of  less  than 12 months) and leasing contracts where the value when new of  the  leased  property  is  low  are  not  recognised  in  the balance  sheet;  the  corresponding  leasing  expenses  are recorded on a straight-line basis in the income statement in general operating expenses.\n\nIn accordance with the provisions set out in the standard, the Group  does  not  apply  IFRS  16  to  leasing  contracts  for intangible fixed assets.\n\n## 1.3.15 Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations\n\nA non-current asset (or a group held for sale) is classified as held-for-sale  if, at close,  its carrying  amount  will  be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through ongoing use.\n\nFor  this  to  be  the  case,  the  asset  (or  group  held  for  sale) must be available for immediate sale in its present condition and its sale must be highly likely.\n\nThe  relevant  assets  and  liabilities  are  shown  separately  on the  balance  sheet  under  'Non-current  assets  held  for  sale' and  'Liabilities  associated  with  non-current  assets  held for sale'.\n\nThe  non-current  assets  (or  disposal  group)  classified  as held -for -sale  are  measured  at  the  lower  of  their  carrying amount and their fair value less cost of sale. In the case of an unrealised loss, a write-down is recognised in profit or loss. They are no longer amortised when they are reclassified.\n\nThey  are  no  longer  amortised  when  they  are  reclassified. If the fair value of a group of assets held for sale less selling costs  is  less  than  its  carrying  amount  after  write-down  of non-current  assets,  the  difference  is  allocated  to  the  other assets  of  the  disposal  group,  including  the  financial  assets, and  is  recognised  under  net  income  from  discontinued operations.\n\nA discontinued operation is any component that the Group has  either  disposed  of,  or  is  classified  as  held-for-sale,  and which is in any of the following situations:\n\n- \u00b7 it is a major separate business line or a geographical area of operations;\n- \u00b7 it  is  part  of  a  single  coordinated  plan  to  dispose  of  a separate  major  business  line  or  geographical  area  of operations; or,\n- \u00b7 it is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale.\n\nThe following are disclosed on a separate line of the income statement:\n\n- \u00b7 the net income from discontinued operations until the date of disposal, net of tax;\n- \u00b7 the  gain  or  loss  recognised  on  the  disposal  or  on measurement  at  fair  value  less  the  cost  of  sale  of  the assets and liabilities constituting the discontinued operations, net of tax.\n\nAmundi did not record any transactions covered within the scope of IFRS 5 during the 2023 financial year.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Only substantive (voting  or  contractual)  rights  are  examined  to  assess  the concept  of  power.  Rights  are  considered  substantive  if  the holder  of  the  rights  can  exercise  them,  in  practice,  when decisions about the entity's relevant activities are made.\n\nAmundi  is  deemed  to  control  a  subsidiary  through  voting rights  when its voting rights give it the ability to direct the subsidiary's relevant activities. Amundi is generally considered to control a subsidiary when it holds more than half  of  the  existing  or  potential  voting  rights  in  an  entity, whether  directly  or  indirectly  through  subsidiaries,  except when  it  can  be  clearly  demonstrated  that  such  ownership does  not  give  it  the  power  to  direct  its  relevant  activities. Control is  also  deemed  to  exist  when  Amundi  holds  half  or less than half of the voting rights, including potential rights, in  an  entity  but  is  able  in  practice  to  direct  its  relevant activities  at  its  sole  discretion,  notably  because  of  the existence of contractual arrangements, the relative size of its stake  in  the  voting  rights  compared  to  those  of  other investors, or other facts or circumstances.\n\nControl of a structured entity is not assessed on the basis of the  percentage  of  voting  rights,  because  by  their  nature these  have  no  effect  on  the  entity's  yields.  When  assessing control,  consideration  is  given  not  only  to  contractual arrangements, but also  to  whether  Amundi  was  involved  in creating  the  entity  and  what  decisions  it  made  at  the  time,\n\nwhat agreements were made at its inception and what risks are borne by Amundi, any rights under agreements that only give  the  investor  the  power  to  direct  relevant  activities  in specific circumstances and any other facts or circumstances that indicate that the investor can direct the entity's relevant activities.  Where there is a management mandate, it should be established whether the investment manager is in practice acting as an agent (with delegated powers) or as a principal (on  their  own  account).  Accordingly,  when  decisions  about the  entity's  relevant  activities  must  be  taken,  the  indicators used  to  assess  whether  an  entity  is  acting  as  agent  or principal  are  as  follows:  the  extent  of  the  decision-making powers compared to the powers over the entity delegated to the  investment  manager,  the  compensation  provided  for under the contractual agreements, but also any substantive rights  held  by  third  parties  involved  in  the  entity  that  may affect  the  decision-making  capacity  of  the  decision  maker and the exposure to the variable nature of the yields of other interests held in the entity.\n\nJoint control is deemed to exist when there is a contractual division  of  control  over  an  economic  activity.  Decisions affecting  the  entity's  relevant  activities  require  unanimous agreement of the parties sharing control.\n\nIn  traditional  entities,  significant  influence  is  defined  as  the power  to  influence,  but  not  control,  a  company's  financial and  operational  policies.  Significant  influence  is  assumed  in cases of 20% or more ownership, either directly or indirectly through subsidiaries, of the voting rights in an entity.\n\n## 1.4.1.2 Control and consolidation of structured entities (special purpose entities)\n\nThe control criteria for structured entities or special purpose entities  (structures  created  to  manage  an  operation  or  a group of similar operations) are defined by IFRS 10.\n\nControl is primarily assessed based on the following:\n\n- \u00b7 the power to manage the entity's operations;\n- \u00b7 the receipt of variable revenue or exposure to the entity's risks;\n- \u00b7 the  ability  to  influence  the  revenue  earned  by  the  entity and the risks.\n\nThese  provisions  are  applicable  to  the  funds  held  or guaranteed by Amundi, in particular.\n\n## Funds held by Group companies\n\nWith  respect  to  the  fund  units  held  by  Group  companies, Amundi's  Management  assesses  the  existence  of  control based on two criteria:\n\n- \u00b7 the  threshold  at  which  the  holding  company  can  be considered to be primary:\n- \u00b7 either in the event of a direct holding in the fund above 35%, or,\n- \u00b7 in the event of a direct holding in the fund above 20% together with the sharing of performance fees between the management company and investors such that total Amundi revenue from the fund is greater than 35%;\n- \u00b7 the  durable  nature  of  the  investment,  established  in  the event of a holding greater than the above thresholds for a period longer than one year.\n\nUnder this analysis, cases of control of a fund by a company within the scope are limited and only involve dedicated funds and certain fund holdings for seed money.",

This passive, directed management  and  the  internal  management  rules  (careful selection  of  exposures  to  credit  risk,  strict  management  of the  turnover  of  assets  held  by  the  fund)  limit  Amundi's exposure to variable yields.\n\n## 1.4.2 Consolidation methods\n\nConsolidation  methods  are  defined  in  IFRS  10,  IFRS  11  and IAS  28.  They  result  from  the  type  of  control  exercised  by Amundi over the entities that can be consolidated, regardless of activity or whether or not they have legal entity status:\n\n- \u00b7 full consolidation, for controlled entities;\n- \u00b7 equity  method,  for  entities  over  which  Amundi  exercises significant influence and joint ventures.\n\n## Full consolidation\n\nFull consolidation substitutes each of the assets and liabilities carried by each subsidiary for the value of the shares.\n\n## Equity method\n\nSignificant  investments  in  joint  ventures  and  associates  are recognised separately in the balance sheet under 'Investments in equity-accounted entities'.\n\nLikewise,  portfolio  insurance  fund  structuring  is  closely monitored  and  this  significantly  limits  the  guarantor's exposure:\n\n- \u00b7 investors  who  generally  have  immediate  rights  to  the yields  on  the  funds'  assets:  Amundi's  exposure  to  market risk  is  low;  it  is  essentially  tied  to  dynamic  assets  and  is further  reduced  by  internal  management  rules  (very prudent  assessment  of  risk  exposure,  strict  liquidity  and diversification controls);\n- \u00b7 exposure  to  credit  risk  which  is  essentially  tied  to monetising assets and is governed by the same restrictions as  those  applied  to  structured  funds  and  reflects  a  high level of caution at issuer selection time.\n\nThe  equity  method  substitutes  for  the  value  of  shares  the Group's proportional share of the equity and net income of the  companies  in  question.  The  change  in  the  carrying amount of the shares includes changes in goodwill.\n\n## Non-controlling interests\n\nThe  equity  and  net  income  attributable  to  non-controlling interests is presented separately in the consolidated balance sheet and income statement.\n\nNon-controlling  interests  are  as  defined  by  IFRS  10.  They incorporate  instruments  representing  present  ownership interests that give the right to a proportional share of the net assets  in  the  event  of  liquidation  and  the  other  equity instruments  issued  by  the  subsidiary  and  not  held  by the Group.\n\n## 1.4.3 Restatements and eliminations within the Amundi Group\n\nThe impact of the Group's internal transactions on the consolidated balance sheet and income statement is eliminated for fully consolidated entities.\n\nCapital gains or losses arising from intra-Group asset transfers are eliminated. Any potential lasting depreciation measured at the time of disposal of an internal transaction is recognised.\n\n## 1.4.4 Translation of the financial statements of foreign subsidiaries\n\nConsolidated financial statements are prepared in euros.\n\nThe  financial  statements  of  entities  which  constitute  a 'foreign  operation'  (subsidiaries,  branches,  associates  or joint ventures) are converted into euros in two stages:\n\n- \u00b7 if  applicable,  the  local  currency  in  which  the  financial statements  are  prepared  is  translated  into  the  functional currency  (currency  of  the  main  business  environment  in which the entity operates). The translation is made as if the information had been initially recognised in the functional currency  (same  translation  principles  as  for  foreign currency  translations);he  functional  currency  is  translated into euros, the currency in which the Group's consolidated financial statements are presented;\n- \u00b7 the  functional  currency  is  translated  into  euros,  the currency  in  which  the  Group's  consolidated  financial statements  are  presented.  Assets  and  liabilities,  including goodwill,  are  translated  at  the  closing  rate.  Equity  items, such  as  share  capital  or  reserves,  are  translated  at  their historical exchange  rate.  The  income  and  expenses included  in  the  income  statement  are  translated  at  the average  exchange  rate  for  the  period.  The  resulting exchange  differences  are  recognised  as  a  separate component of equity. These currency translation adjustments are recognised as net income in the event of disposal  of  the  foreign  operation  (sale,  repayment  of capital, liquidation, discontinuation of operations) or in the event of a deconsolidation due to a loss of control (even without  sale)  while  accounting  for  the  income  from  the disposal or loss of control.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

On the date of acquisition,  the  identifiable  assets,  liabilities  and  contingent liabilities of the acquired entity which meet IFRS 3 conditions for  recognition  are  recognised  at  their  fair  value.  Notably, restructuring liabilities are only recognised as a liability of the acquired entity if, on the acquisition date, the entity is under an obligation to carry out the restructuring.\n\nEarn-out  clauses  are  recognised  at  fair  value  even  if  their application  is  not  probable.

Only  earn-out  clauses  for  transactions  where  control was obtained at the latest by 31 December 2009 can still be recorded against goodwill, because these transactions were accounted for under IFRS 3 before the revision.\n\nNon-controlling  interests  representing  shares  of  current interests giving rights to a share of the net assets in the event of  liquidation  may  be  measured  in  one  of  two  ways  at  the purchaser's choice:\n\n- \u00b7 at fair value on the acquisition date (full goodwill method);\n- \u00b7 at the share of the identifiable assets and liabilities of the acquired company revalued at fair value.\n\nThe option may be exercised acquisition by acquisition.\n\nIn accordance with IFRS 3, the initial valuation of the assets, liabilities  and  contingent  liabilities  can  be  revised  within  a maximum of 12 months from the acquisition date.\n\nThe  consideration  transferred  at  the  time  of  a  business combination (acquisition cost) is measured as the total of fair values  transferred  by  the  purchaser  on  the  acquisition  date in exchange for control of the acquired entity (for example: cash, equity instruments).\n\n## 1.4.6 Goodwill impairment\n\nGoodwill is tested for impairment whenever there is objective evidence of a loss of value, and at least once a year. IAS 36 requires  that  impairment  on  goodwill  be  determined  by reference to the recoverable amount of the cash-generating Unit (CGU) or CGU group to which it belongs.\n\nCash-generating Units are defined as the smallest identifiable group  of  assets  and  liabilities  generating  incoming  cash independently  of  cash  generated  by  other  asset  groups. Amundi's organisation is defined by a very high centralisation and interdisciplinary nature of the functions inherent to asset management.  This  centralisation  and  integration  translate into  the  following  organisational  principles:  an  integrated management platform, cross-functional investment products\n\nThe costs directly attributable to the business combination in question  must  be  recognised  as  expenses  separately  from the business combination. If there is a very strong possibility that the transaction will occur, they are recognised under the heading  'Net  gains  or  losses  on  other  assets';  otherwise, they are recognised under 'General operating expenses'.\n\nThe difference between the sum of the acquisition cost and noncontrolling  interests  and  the  net  balance  on  the  date  of acquisition of acquired identifiable assets and liabilities taken over,  valued  at  their  fair  value,  is  recognised  and,  when  it  is positive, on the assets side of the consolidated balance sheet under the heading 'Goodwill' when the acquired entity is fully consolidated,  and  under  the  heading  'Investments  in  equityaccounted entities' when the acquired company is consolidated using the equity method of accounting. Any negative change in the value of goodwill is recorded immediately in profit or loss.\n\nGoodwill is carried on the balance sheet at its initial amount in  the  currency  of  the  acquired  entity  and  translated  at  the closing rate on the reporting date.\n\nWhen  control  is  taken  by  stages,  the  interest  held  before taking control is revalued at fair value through profit or loss on the acquisition date and the goodwill is calculated once, using  the  fair  value  at  the  date  of  acquisition  of  acquired assets and liabilities taken over.\n\nIn the event of an increase in Amundi's percentage of interest in an  entity  which  it  already  exclusively  controls,  the  difference between the acquisition cost and the share of net assets acquired is recognised under 'Consolidated reserves, Group share'. In the event that the Amundi percentage of ownership interest in an entity  that  remains  under  its  exclusive  control  declines,  the difference between the disposal price and the carrying amount of the  share  of  net  assets  sold  is  also  recognised  under 'Consolidated reserves, Group share'. The expenses arising from these transactions are recognised in equity.\n\nand  solutions,  interlinked  sales  and  key  interdisciplinary functions. This organisation has resulted in the identification of  a  single  CGU.  Therefore,  goodwill  is  tested  at  the  Group level in accordance with the provisions of IAS 36.\n\nThe recoverable amount of the CGU is defined as the higher of the market value and the value in use. The value in use is the present value of the estimated future cash flows of the CGU, as set out in medium-term business plans prepared by the Group for its management purposes.\n\nWhen  the  recoverable  amount  is  lower  than  the  carrying amount,  a  corresponding  impairment  is  recognised  for  the goodwill allocated to the CGU or CGU group. The impairment is irreversible.",

The accounting breakdown  tables  are  nonetheless  still  included  in  the financial statements.\"\n\nAs a credit institution, Amundi is subject to French prudential regulations, which implement into French law the provisions of  the  EU  Directive  \"Access  to  the  activity  of  credit institutions and the prudential supervision of credit institutions  and  investment  firms\".  Amundi  has  managed  its capital so as to satisfy the levels of regulatory capital defined in the  EU  Directive  2013/36  (CRD  IV)  and  European Regulation 575/2013 (CRR) since 1 January 2014 and required by  the  relevant  authorities,  the  European  Central  Bank  and the Autorit\u00e9 de contr\u00f4le prudentiel et de r\u00e9solution (ACPR) to  cover  risk-weighted  assets  in  terms  of  credit  risks, operational risks and market risks.\n\nRegulatory  capital, calculated on the basis Amundi's reporting  entities, breaks  down  into  three  categories: Common Equity Tier 1 capital (CET1), Additional Tier 1 capital (AT1)  and Tier  2 capital  consisting  of  equity  and  debt instruments, to which  various  adjustments  are  made. Regulatory capital is obtained from accounting shareholders' equity.  The  adjustments  made  (prudential  filters)  mostly involve  deducting  goodwill  and  intangible  assets  (net  of deferred taxes).\n\nAmundi  principally  holds  CET1  capital,  consisting  of  share capital and undistributed reserves. As part of the financing of the  Pioneer  acquisition,  Amundi  issued  Tier  2  capital  in  the amount of \u20ac300 million in 2017, maturing in May 2027. This instrument  was  partially  refinanced  in  2022  and  2023  for  a total amount of \u20ac200 million, through two new issues of Tier 2 capital of \u20ac100 million each, with maturity dates of August 2032 and August 2033 respectively.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

The change over the financial year was mainly due to exchange rate fluctuations during the period.\n\nThe goodwill consists of the following main items:\n\n- \u00b7 \u20ac377.9 million of goodwill recognised upon the transfer by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Indosuez of its asset management business in December 2003;\n- \u00b7 the  goodwill  recorded  in  2004  upon  the  acquisition  of Cr\u00e9dit Lyonnais by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. for \u20ac1,732.8 million;\n- \u00b7 the  goodwill  recorded  relating  to  the  contribution  of Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale's asset management business in December 2009 for \u20ac707.8 million;\n- \u00b7 goodwill recognised in 2015 at the time of the acquisition of Amundi Austria for \u20ac78.4 million;\n- \u00b7 the goodwill recognised in 2016 following the acquisitions of  KBI  Global  Investors  and  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  Immobilier Investors for a total of \u20ac159.9 million;\n- \u00b7 the goodwill recorded in 2017 following the acquisition of Pioneer Investments for a total of \u20ac2,537.3 million;\n- \u00b7 a  total  of  \u20ac335.0  million  of  goodwill  recognised  in  2020 following the acquisition of Sabadell AM;\n- \u00b7 the goodwill recorded in 2021 following the acquisition of Lyxor for a total of \u20ac650.7 million;\n\nGoodwill is tested for impairment based on the Group's value in  use.  Determination  of  the  value  in  use  is  based  on  the present value of estimated future cash flows of the Group as set out in the medium-term business plans prepared by the Group for management purposes.\n\nThe  impairment  test  conducted  at  31  December  2023  was carried out using results forecasts for the 2022-2025 period. The results  forecasts  were  primarily  based  on  the  following assumptions about the economic environment:\n\n- \u00b7 equity markets will fall in 2024 before a sustained climb in 2025 and 2026;\n- \u00b7 on the interest rate markets, long and short rates will rise in 2024 compared with 2023, then decline slightly in 2025 and 2026.\n\nAmundi used a 2% perpetual growth rate for the tests as at 31 December 2023 and 2022 and a discount rate of 8.4% for the test as at 31 December 2023 (versus a discount rate of 8.1% used for the tests as at 31 December 2022).\n\nA  change  in  these  assumptions  (+/-50  basis  points  in  the discount rate and +/-50 basis points in the perpetual growth rate)  would  not  change  the  conclusions  of  the  impairment test as at 31 December 2023.",

Funds are managed by independent organisations and the contributing companies have no legal or implied obligation to pay additional contributions if the funds do not generate sufficient revenue to cover all of the benefits corresponding to services rendered by employees during the year and during prior financial years. Consequently, Amundi Group entities have no liabilities in this respect other than their contributions to  be  paid.

The  adjustment  is  calculated  on  an aggregate  basis  by  counterparty  according  to  the  future exposure  profile  of  the  transactions  after  deducting  any collateral. This adjustment is always negative and is to be deducted  from  the  fair  value  of  the  financial  instruments booked on the asset side of the balance sheet;\n- \u00b7 a value adjustment for the credit risk for our Company ( Debt Value  Adjustment -  DVA)  intended  to  integrate  the  risk associated  with  our  counterparties  in  the  valuation  of derivatives. The adjustment is calculated on an aggregate basis by counterparty based on the future exposure profile of the transactions. This adjustment is always positive and is to  be  deducted  from  the  fair  value  of  the  financial instruments booked on the liability side of the balance sheet.\n\n## 7.2 Other financial assets and liabilities\n\n## 7.2.1 Other financial assets\n\nThe  listed non-consolidated  equity  interests  (primarily Resona  Holding),  government  securities  (listed  on  an organised  market),  listed  bonds  and  fund  units  with  a  net asset value available at least twice a month are classified as Level 1. All other assets and liabilities valued at fair value are classified  as  Level  2  with  the  exception  of private  equity funds which are classified as Level 3.\n\n## 7.2.2 Other financial liabilities\n\nLiabilities at fair value option result from the consolidation of EMTN issue vehicles. These liabilities are classified as Level 2.\n\n## 7.3 Financial assets at fair value on the balance sheet\n\nThe tables below show assets on the balance sheet of financial assets and liabilities valued at fair value and classified by fair value level:\n\n| (In \u20ac thousands)                                                                | Total 31/12/2023   | Prices quoted on active markets  for identical instruments Level 1   | Valuation based on observable data Level 2   | Valuation based on non- observable data Level 3   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|\n| Financial assets held for trading                                               | 3,075,083          |                                                                      | 3,075,083                                    |                                                   |\n| Derivatives                                                                     | 3,075,083          |                                                                      | 3,075,083                                    |                                                   |\n| Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss                           | 19,378,336         | 5,176,023                                                            | 14,177,493                                   | 24,820                                            |\n| Equity instruments                                                              | 435,825            | 11,521                                                               | 424,304                                      | -

This mainly consists of:\n\n- \u00b7 variable-rate  assets  and  liabilities,  for  which  interest  rate changes  do  not  have  a  significant  impact  on  fair  value, since  the  rates  of  yield  of  these  instruments  frequently adjust themselves to market rates (loans and borrowings);\n- \u00b7 short-term  assets  and  liabilities,  where  the  redemption value is close to the market value.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

These  funds,  excluding management  mandates,  are  considered  to  be  structured entities to the extent that they are created for a very specific purpose, are managed  via  contracts  signed  by  the stakeholders, and the rights associated with the voting rights of the shares have limited impact, where applicable.\n\nAmundi has defined criteria to identify companies which are involved as the sponsor of a structured entity:\n\n- \u00b7 the Company is involved in the creation of the structured entity  and  the  intervention,  which  is  remunerated,  is deemed  significant  for  the  successful  completion  of operations;\n- \u00b7 the  structuring  occurred  at  the  request  of  the  Company and it is the primary user;\n- \u00b7 the Company sold its own shares to the structured entity;\n- \u00b7 the Company is the manager of the structured entity;\n- \u00b7 the  name  of  a  subsidiary  or  the  Parent  company  is associated with the name of the structured entity or with the financial instruments it issues.\n\nGiven  this  definition,  all  funds  managed  by  Amundi  Group companies,  whether  held  or  not,  are  considered  to  be 'sponsored' structured entities.\n\nThe Group receives management and performance fees and commissions  from  the  funds.  It can invest, provide guarantees and contract performance swaps with the funds.\n\n## 8.1 Nature and extent of Amundi's involvement with the non-consolidated structured entities\n\nThe table below shows the assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet commitments of the Group in sponsored structured entities, with the exception of those that are consolidated.\n\n31/12/2023\n\n|                                                                                                     | Asset management    | Asset management              | Asset management                                  | Asset management   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|--------------------|\n|                                                                                                     |                     | Maximum loss                  | Maximum loss                                      | Maximum loss       |\n| (In \u20ac thousands)                                                                                    | Balance sheet value | Maximum exposure to loss risk | Guarantees received and other credit enhancements | Net exposure       |\n| Financial assets held for trading                                                                   | 885,245             | 885,245                       |                                                   | 885,245            |\n| Debt instruments that do not meet SPPI criteria: UCITS                                              | 1,837,440           | 1,837,440                     |                                                   | 1,837,440          |\n| Financial assets at fair value through equity                                                       | -

A  provision  for  the  risk associated with this commitment is recorded in 'Provisions' in the amount of \u20ac442 thousand as at 31 December 2023 and \u20ac8,182 thousand as at 31 December 2022.\n\nThe amounts stated in financial assets and liabilities held for trading correspond to the positive and negative fair values of swaps  made  by  Amundi  with  funds  as  part  of  its  swap intermediation business.\n\n## 8.2 Net revenues from sponsored structured entities\n\nThe net revenues from structured entities and from management mandates are inseparable from Amundi's management revenues and are included in the income presented in note 6.2.1.\n\n## Note 9 OTHER INFORMATION\n\n## 9.1 Segment information\n\nAmundi's business is solely focused on managing assets for third  parties.  It  therefore  has  only  one  operating  segment within the meaning of IFRS 8.\n\nThe  Group's  operational  performance  is  not  tracked  more closely than the Group overall. Items that are reviewed at a closer level are limited to monthly reports on Group business volume (net inflows, assets under management) and periodic\n\nreports  on  income  net  of  commissions  by  client  segment (retail, institutional). The Group believes that this information better corresponds to monitoring commercial activity than to measurement  of  operational  performance  for  the  purposes of decision-making for resource allocation. Operating expenses  are  not  allocated  to  client  segments  ( retail and institutional).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

No provisions for write-downs were made for these relationships.\n\n## 9.2.2 Nature of transactions with related parties\n\nAmundi  has  commercial  relationships  with  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole group companies.\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole group is a distributor, a lender and borrower, a derivative  counterparty  and  also  a  depositary  and calculation agent of Amundi's financial products. In addition, Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  group  makes  certain  resources  available  to Amundi  and  manages  Amundi's  end-of-career  allowance insurance.\n\nIn addition, the funds in which the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole group has invested are not considered to be related parties.\n\nA  list  of  the  Amundi  Group's  consolidated  companies  is presented in note 9.3.1. 'Reporting entities'. The transactions carried  out  and  the  outstanding  amounts  at  the  end  of  the period  between  the  fully  consolidated  companies  of  the Group are entirely eliminated on consolidation.\n\nAmundi handles asset management of certain mandates for the  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  group  and  also  provides  book-keeping services  for  the  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  group's  employee  savings plans.",

It  will  also strengthen  Amundi's  positions  in  the  secondary  market  for private  assets,  at  a  time  when  this  type  of  transaction  is particularly relevant given the market conditions.\n\nThis  acquisition  expands  Amundi's  offering  of  tailor-made funds  and  private  asset  solutions  for  its  institutional  clients across the globe. Lastly, it will accelerate the development of private  asset  investment  solutions  designed  for  individual clients.\n\nThe  transaction  is  expected  to  be  completed  by  the  third quarter  of  2024,  subject  to  regulatory  approvals,  with  a maximum price of \u20ac350 million payable in cash over 5 years (subject to certain revenue conditions).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

We  believe  that  the  audit evidence  we  have  obtained  is  sufficient  and  appropriate  to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\nOur  responsibilities  under  those  standards  are  further described  in  the Statutory Auditors'  Responsibilities  for  the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of our report.\n\n## Independence\n\nWe  conducted  our  audit  engagement  in  compliance  with independence requirements of the French Commercial Code ( Code de commerce )  and  the  French  Code of Ethics ( Code de  d\u00e9ontologie )  for  Statutory  Auditors,  for  the  period  from\n\nJanuary 1, 2023 to the date of our report and specifically we did not provide any prohibited non-audit services referred to in Article 5(1) of Regulation (EU) No 537/2014.\n\n## Justification of Assessments - Key Audit Matters\n\nIn accordance with the requirements of Articles L.821-53 and R.821-180  of  the  French  Commercial  Code  ( Code  de commerce )  relating  to  the  justification  of  our  assessments, we inform  you  of  the  key  audit  matters  relating  to  risks  of material  misstatement  that,  in  our  professional  judgment, were  of  most  significance  in  our  audit  of  the  financial statements  of  the  current  period,  as  well  as  how  we addressed those risks.\n\nThese matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the  financial  statements  as  a  whole  and  in  forming  our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on specific items of the financial statements.",

        "page_content": "## Goodwill measurement\n\n## Risk identified\n\n## Our response\n\nThe  goodwill  mainly  arises  from  external  growth  operations and amounts to \u20ac 6.7 billion as of December 31, 2023.\n\nAs mentioned in Note 1.4.6 to the consolidated financial statements, goodwill is subject to impairment tests as soon as there is objective evidence of a loss of value, and at least once a year.\n\nThese  tests  are  based  on  the  comparison  between  the  carrying amount  of  the  cash  generating  unit  (CGU)  and  its  recoverable amount.  The  recoverable  amount  of  the  CGU  is  defined  as  the highest  value  between  its  market  value  and  its  value  in  use.  The value in  use  is  calculated  on  the  basis  of  the  present  value  of  the future cash flows generated by the CGU.\n\nAs indicated  in  note  5.13  to  the  consolidated  financial  statements, these  estimated  future  cash  flows  are  determined  on  the  basis  of the  medium-term  business  plans  prepared  by  the  Group  for  its management purposes. They are based on assumptions concerning the  growth  of  the  Group's  business  and  include  macroeconomic parameters evolution.\n\nThe present value of the future cash flows also takes into account assumptions concerning discount rates and perpetual growth rate which necessitate the exercise of Management's judgment.\n\nIn  view  of  the  materiality  of  the  goodwill  and  the  degree  of management's  judgment  to  determine  the  assumptions  used  to calculate an impairment loss, we considered goodwill measurement to be a key audit matter.\n\nWe have reviewed the methodology used by the Amundi Group to identify any indications of impairment.\n\nWe also appreciated the documentation provided by Amundi which demonstrates the existence of a unique CGU in the group.\n\nWe  examined  the  calculations  performed  and  we  involved  our valuation specialists to assess the assumptions used by Management  to  determine  the  discount  rates  and  the  perpetual growth rates used in the discounted cash flow calculations, where necessary by comparing them with external sources.\n\nWe also examined the financial trajectories prepared by the Group's Management and used in the impairment tests in order :\n\n- \u00b7 to compare them with the information presented to the Group's Board of Directors;\n- \u00b7 to assess the main underlying assumptions. The reliability of these assumptions  was  assessed  in  particular  by  comparing  the financial trajectories developed in previous years with the actual performance.\n\nWe  also  performed  sensitivity  analyses  on  certain  assumptions (perpetual growth rate, discount rate).\n\nFinally, we  assessed  the  appropriateness  of  the  information disclosed  in  the  notes  to  the  consolidated  financial  statements  on the results of these impairment tests and the level of sensitivity to the various assumptions.\n\n## Specific verifications\n\nWe have also performed, in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, the specific verification required by laws and regulations of the Group's information given in the management report of the Board of Directors.\n\nWe have no matters to report as to their fair presentation and their consistency with the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements\n\n## Format of presentation of the consolidated financial statements intended to be included in the annual financial report\n\nWe  have  also  verified,  in  accordance  with  the  professional standard  applicable  in  France  relating  to  the  procedures performed  by  the  Statutory  Auditor  relating  to  the  annual and  consolidated  financial  statements  presented  in  the European  single  electronic  format,  that  the  presentation  of the consolidated  financial statements  intended  to  be included  in  the  annual  financial  report  mentioned  in  Article L.451-1-2, I of the French Monetary and Financial Code ( Code mon\u00e9taire et financier ),  prepared under the responsibility of the  Deputy  General  Manager,  complies  with  the  single electronic format  defined  in  the  European  Delegated Regulation No 2019/815 of 17 December 2018. As it relates to consolidated financial statements, our work includes verifying that  the  tagging  of  these  consolidated  financial  statements complies  with  the  format  defined  in  the  above  delegated regulation.\n\n## Appointment of the Statutory Auditors\n\nWe were appointed as Statutory Auditors of Amundi by the Annual  General  Meeting  held  on  November  16,  1989  for PricewaterhouseCoopers  Audit  and  on  May  10,  2021  for Mazars.\n\nBased on the work we have performed, we conclude that the presentation of the consolidated financial statements intended  to  be  included  in  the  annual  financial  report complies,  in  all  material  respects,  with  the  European  single electronic format.\n\nDue to the technical limitations inherent to the block-tagging of  the  consolidated  financial  statements  according  to  the European single electronic format, the content of certain tags of  the  notes  may  not  be  rendered  identically  to  the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\n\nBesides,  we  have  no  responsibility  to  verify  that  the consolidated  financial  statements  that  will  ultimately  be included by your company in the annual financial report filed with the AMF are in agreement with those on which we have performed our work.\n\nAs  at  December  31,  2021,  PricewaterhouseCoopers  Audit were  in  the  thirty  fifth  year  of  total  and  uninterrupted engagement  and  Mazars  in  its  third  year,  of  which respectively  twenty  seven  years  and  three  years  since securities  of  the  Company  became  a  public  interest  entity, due to its status as a credit institution.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Our objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about  whether  the  consolidated  financial  statements  as  a whole  are  free  from  material  misstatement.  Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that  an  audit  conducted  in  accordance  with  professional standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.  Misstatements  can  arise  from  fraud  or  error  and  are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could  reasonably  be  expected  to  influence  the  economic decisions  of  users  taken  on  the  basis  of  these  consolidated financial statements.\n\nAs  specified  in  Article  L.821-55  of  the  French  Commercial Code  ( Code  de  commerce ),  our  statutory  audit  does  not include  assurance  on  the  viability  of  the  Company  or  the quality of management of the affairs of the Company.\n\nAs  part  of  an  audit  conducted  in  accordance  with professional  standards  applicable  in  France,  the  Statutory Auditor  exercises  professional  judgment  throughout  the audit and furthermore:\n\n- \u00b7 Identifies  and  assesses  the  risks  of  material  misstatement of  the  consolidated  financial  statements,  whether  due  to fraud  or  error,  designs  and  performs  audit  procedures responsive  to  those  risks,  and  obtains  audit  evidence considered  to  be  sufficient  and  appropriate  to  provide  a basis  for  his  opinion.  The  risk  of  not  detecting  a  material misstatement  resulting  from  fraud  is  higher  than  for  one resulting  from  error,  as  fraud  may  involve  collusion, forgery,  intentional  omissions,  misrepresentations,  or  the override of internal control.\n- \u00b7 Obtains  an  understanding  of  internal  control  relevant  to the  audit  in  order  to  design  audit  procedures  that  are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of  expressing  an  opinion  on  the  effectiveness  of  the internal control.\n- \u00b7 Evaluates the appropriateness of accounting policies used and  the  reasonableness  of  accounting  estimates  and related disclosures made by management in the consolidated financial statements.\n- \u00b7 Assesses the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence  obtained,  whether  a  material  uncertainty  exists related  to  events  or  conditions  that  may  cast  significant doubt  on  the  Company's  ability  to  continue  as  a  going concern.  This  assessment  is  based  on  the  audit  evidence obtained  up  to  the  date  of  his  audit  report.  However, future  events  or  conditions  may  cause  the  Company  to cease  to  continue  as  a  going  concern.  If  the  Statutory Auditor concludes that a material uncertainty exists, there is  a  requirement  to  draw  attention  in  the  audit  report  to the  related  disclosures  in  the  consolidated  financial statements  or,  if  such  disclosures  are  not  provided  or inadequate, to modify the opinion expressed therein.\n- \u00b7 Evaluates  the  overall  presentation  of  the  consolidated financial statements and assesses whether these statements  represent  the  underlying  transactions  and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n- \u00b7 Obtains  sufficient  appropriate  audit  evidence  regarding the  financial  information  of  the  entities  or  business activities  within  the  Group  to  express  an  opinion  on  the consolidated financial statements. The Statutory Auditor is responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of  the  audit  of  the  consolidated  financial  statements  and for  the  opinion  expressed  on  these  consolidated  financial statements.",

This text amends Article 18 of the French Banking Act 84-46 of 24 January 1984 and repeals Article 99.\n\nUnder  the  French  Financial  Activity  Modernisation  Act  96597  of  2  July  1997,  Amundi  opted  to  be  classified  as  a financial company, i.e., a credit institution.\n\nThe Comit\u00e9 des \u00e9tablissements de cr\u00e9dit et des entreprises d'investissement (Credit Institutions and Investment Firms  Committee)  redefined  Amundi's  accreditation  on 19  February  2002.  Amundi  is  authorised  as  a  financial company to provide capital and/or performance guarantees in  the  area  of  asset  management, specifically for the clients of the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole group or UCITS managed thereby.\n\nOwnership percentages in the Company are:\n\n- \u00b7 68.93% by the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole group;\n- \u00b7 30.46% by the public (including employees);\n- \u00b7 0.61% in treasury shares.\n\n## 1.3 Events after the 2023 financial year\n\nNo significant events took place after the financial year end, whether recognised or not.\n\n## Note 2 ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES AND METHODS\n\nThe presentation of the financial statements of Amundi is consistent with the provisions of ANC Regulation 2014-07, which brings together all of the accounting standards applicable to credit institutions.\n\nThere are no changes in accounting methods and in the presentation of the financial statements compared with the previous financial year.\n\n## 2.1 Loans and receivables due from credit institutions and customers financing commitments\n\nLoans and receivables from credit institutions, Amundi Group entities and  clients  are  governed  by  ANC  Regulation No. 2014-07.\n\nThey are broken down according to their initial duration or the nature of the credit facilities:\n\n- \u00b7 demand loans and term loans for credit institutions;\n- \u00b7 ordinary accounts and term deposits and advances for the internal transactions of the Amundi Group;\n- \u00b7 trade  receivables,  other  loans  and  ordinary  accounts  for clients.\n\nThe  customer  section  includes  transactions  completed  with financial customers.\n\nSubordinated  loans,  as  well  as  repurchase  agreements (taking  the  form  of  securities  or  assets),  are  incorporated under the various loans and receivables sections, depending on the type of counterparty (interbank, internal transactions within Cr\u00e9dit Agricole, customer).\n\nLoans and advances to banks and clients are recognised on the  balance  sheet  at  their  nominal  value,  including  accrued interest.\n\nAccrued  interest  not  yet  due  on  loans  and  receivables  is recognised under related receivables through profit or loss.\n\nIn  accordance  with  ANC  regulation  2014-07,  commissions and  fees  received  and  the  marginal  cost  of  transactions completed are spread out over the actual life of the loan and are  therefore  incorporated  into  the  outstanding  balance  of the relevant loan.\n\nSigned  commitments  recognised  in  the  off-balance  sheet section  correspond  to  irrevocable  cash  loan  commitments and  guarantee  commitments  that  have  not  resulted  in movements of funds.\n\nThe accounting treatment of credit risk is defined below:\n\n- \u00b7 The use of external and/or internal rating systems makes it possible to assess the level of credit risk.\n- \u00b7 Loans  and  receivables  and  financing  commitments  are divided between unimpaired and doubtful.\n\n## 1.2 Significant events relating to the financial year 2023\n\n## Capital increase reserved for Group employees\n\nOn 23 June 20023, the Amundi group issued a press release announcing  the  launch  of  a  capital  increase  reserved  for employees, the principle of which had been authorised by the general meeting of 12 May 2023.\n\nThe subscription period for this capital increase reserved for employees ended on 30 June 2023.\n\nNearly 2,000 employees from 15 countries took part in this capital  increase  by  subscribing  for  787,503  new  shares  (or 0.4% of the share capital) for an aggregate amount of \u20ac30.3 million.\n\nThis capital increase took place on 27 July 2023, bringing the number  of  shares  comprising  Amundi's  share  capital  to 204,647,634 equities. In addition, Group employees held 1.5% of the share capital compared with 1.1% previously.",

        "page_content": "## Unimpaired loans and receivables\n\nAs  long  as  receivables  are  not  deemed  doubtful,  they  are considered  unimpaired  or  deteriorated  and  remain  under their original heading.\n\n## Provisions for credit risk on unimpaired, deteriorated outstanding loans\n\nWith regard to credit exposures, Amundi Finance recognises provisions on the liabilities side of its balance sheet to cover the  expected  credit  risks  over  the  next  twelve  months (exposures  qualified  as  performing)  and/or  over  the  life  of the  assets  if  the  credit  quality  of  the  exposure  has deteriorated significantly (exposures classified as downgraded).\n\nThese  provisions  are  determined  as  part  of  a  special monitoring process and are based on estimates showing the change in the expected credit risk level.\n\n## Doubtful loans and receivables\n\nThese  are  receivables  of  all  kinds,  even  when  backed  by guarantees, with a demonstrated credit risk corresponding to one of the following situations:\n\n- \u00b7 There are one or more unpaid instalments within the past year, at least.\n- \u00b7 The  counterparty's  situation  suggests  the  existence  of  a demonstrated  risk,  independent  of  the  existence  of  any arrears.\n- \u00b7 There  are  disputes  between  the  establishment  and  its counterparty.\n- \u00b7 Significant  payment  arrears  generally  in  excess  of  ninety days  unless  special  circumstances  show  that  the  arrears are due to reasons unrelated to the debtor's situation.\n- \u00b7 The entity deems it unlikely that the debtor will settle its credit obligations in full without recourse to measures such as the provision of surety.\n\nA loan is said to be doubtful when one or more events have occurred that have a harmful effect on its estimated future cash flows. The following events are observable data that are indicative of a non-performing loan:\n\n- \u00b7 major financial difficulties experienced by the issuer or the borrower;\n- \u00b7 a breach of contract, such as failed or late payment;\n- \u00b7 the  granting  of  one  or  more  favours  by  one  or  more lenders  to  the  borrower  for  economic  or  contractual reasons relating to the borrower's financial difficulties that the  lender(s)  would  not  have  envisaged  under  other circumstances;\n- \u00b7 the  increasing  probability  of  the  failure  or  financial restructuring of the borrower;\n- \u00b7 the  disappearance  of  an  active  market  for  the  financial asset due to financial difficulties;\n- \u00b7 the  purchase  or  creation  of  a  financial  asset  with  a  big discount, which reflects the credit losses suffered.\n\nA loan may be deemed doubtful because of a combination of several events.\n\nA  defaulting  counterparty  can  return  to  unimpaired  status only  after  it  has  been  validated  over  the  course  of  an observation period that the debtor is no longer in a doubtful position.\n\nAmong doubtful loans, Amundi makes a distinction between non-performing  doubtful  loans  and  performing  doubtful loans.\n\n## Performing doubtful loans and receivables\n\nPerforming doubtful loans and receivables are those that do not meet the definition of non-performing doubtful receivables.\n\n## Non-performing doubtful loans and receivables\n\nDoubtful  loans  and  receivables  with  a  very  poor  collection outlook and for which a future write-off is being considered.\n\nInterest continues to accrue on doubtful loans and receivables  as  long  as  they  are  considered  doubtful  but performing. Interest stops accruing as soon as the receivable becomes non-performing.\n\nClassification as a doubtful loan can be disregarded as soon as  the  demonstrated  credit  risk  is  permanently  eliminated and when regular payments have resumed for the amounts stipulated for the original contractual due dates. In this case, the loan is once again considered unimpaired.\n\n## Impairments for credit risk on doubtful outstanding\n\nAs  soon  as  a  loan  becomes  doubtful,  Amundi  accounts  for the probable write-off through a write-down deducted from the asset on the balance sheet. These write-downs represent the  difference  between  the  book  value  of  the  loan  or receivable and the future estimated flows discounted at the contract  rate,  while  taking  into  consideration  the  financial position  and  economic  outlook  of  the  counterparty,  as  well as any potential guarantees minus their cost of enforcement.\n\nPotential write-offs relating to off-balance sheet commitments  are  taken  into  account  through  provisions included in balance sheet liabilities.\n\n## Accounting treatment of write-downs\n\nImpairment allocations and reversals for risk of non-recovery on doubtful loans and receivables are recognised in cost of risk.\n\nIn accordance with ANC Regulation 2014-07, the Group has elected  to  recognise  the  effects  of  the  unwinding  of impairments in risk costs.\n\n## Writing off of losses\n\nThe assessment of the time period for a write-off is based on the  judgement  of  experts.  Amundi  determines  this  with  its Risk  Management  Department,  based  on  its  knowledge  of its business.\n\nLoans  and  receivables  that  have  become  irrecoverable  are recognised  as  losses  and  the  corresponding  write-downs are reversed.\n\n7\n\n<!-- image -->",

The total balance of differences resulting  from  changes  in  exchange  rates  is  recognised  in  the income statement and recorded in the item 'Net gains (losses) on trading book'.\n\nThey  are  recognised  on  the  balance  sheet  at  their  acquisition price, excluding acquisition costs.\n\nAt  each  reporting  date,  the  securities  are  valued  at  the  most recent market price of the day.\n\nThe  total  balance  of  differences  resulting  from  changes  in exchange  rates  is  recognised  in  the  income  statement  and recorded in the item 'Net gains (losses) on trading book'.\n\n## Short-term investment securities\n\nThis category is for securities that are not recognised within the other categories.\n\nThe  securities  are  recognised  at  their  acquisition  price, including costs.\n\n## Bonds and other fixed-income securities\n\nThese  securities  are  recognised  at  their  acquisition  price, accrued income on purchase included.\n\nThe difference between the purchase price and the redemption value is spread over the residual life of the security.\n\nThe revenue is recognised in the income statement under the heading  'Interest  and  similar  income  on  bonds  and  other fixed-income securities'.\n\n## Equities and other variable-income securities\n\nEquities  are  recognised  on  the  balance  sheet  at  their purchase  value,  including  acquisition  costs.  Revenues  from dividends  associated  with  equities  are  recognised  in  the 'Revenues  from  variable-income  securities'  section  of  the income statement.\n\nRevenue from SICAVs (variable-capital investment companies) and mutual funds are recorded at the time the funds are received in the same section.\n\nShort-term investment securities are valued at the lower of the  purchase  cost  or  the  market  value  at  the  end  of  the financial  year.  Accordingly,  when  the  book  value  of  one holding or of a homogeneous set of securities (calculated, for example, using the stock market price on the closing date) is lower than the carrying amount, a charge for write-down of unrealised  losses  is  recognised  without  any  offset  for  any capital gains recorded under other types of securities. Gains generated by hedges, as defined in ANC regulation 2014-07, taking  the  form  of  purchases  or  sales  of  forward  financial instruments,  are  taken  into  account  in  calculating  writedowns. Potential capital gains are not recognised.\n\nDisposals of securities are deemed to involve the securities of the same type that were subscribed at the earliest date.\n\nImpairment  allocations  and  reversals  as  well  as  gains  or losses from disposal of short-term investment securities are recognised  in  'balance  of  short-term  investment  portfolios and similar transactions' of the income statement.",

However, if the impairment is due to a risk specific to the issuer of the security, an impairment loss is recorded under \"Cost of risk\".\n\nIf  investment  securities  are  sold  or  transferred  to  another category of securities for a significant amount, the institution may  no  longer  classify  previously  acquired  securities  and securities to be acquired as investment securities during the current financial year or the following two financial years, in accordance with ANC Regulation 2014-07.\n\n## Investments in subsidiaries and affiliates, equity investments and other long-term investments\n\n- \u00b7 Investments in subsidiaries and affiliates are investments in companies that are under exclusive control and which are, or are likely to be, fully consolidated into a single group.\n- \u00b7 Equity investments are investments (other than investments in subsidiaries and affiliates), whose long-term ownership  is  deemed  beneficial  to  the  reporting  entity, particularly  because  it  allows  it  to  exercise  influence  or control over the issuer.\n- \u00b7 Other  long-term  equity  investments  consist  of  securities held  with  the  intention  of  promoting  long-term  business relations by creating a special relationship with the issuer, but involve no influence on the issuer's management due to the small percentage of voting rights held.\n\nThe  securities  are  recognised  at  their  acquisition  price, including costs.\n\nAt  the  end  of  the  financial  year,  these  securities  are measured  individually  based  on  their  value  in  use  and  are recorded  on  the  balance  sheet  at  the  lower  end  of  their historical cost or value in use.\n\nThe value in use represents what the institution would agree to  pay  out  in  order  to  acquire  them,  given  its  holding objectives.\n\nThe  value  in  use  may  be  estimated  on  the  basis  of  various factors  such  as  the  issuer's  profitability  and  profitability outlook,  its  equity,  the  economic  environment  or  even  its average  share  price  in  the  preceding  months  or  the mathematical value of the security.\n\nWhen  value  in  use  is  lower  than  the  historical  cost, impairments are booked for these unrealised losses, without offset against any unrealised gains.\n\nImpairment  allocations  and  reversals  as  well  as  gains  or losses from  disposal  relating to these securities are recognised  in  the  section  'Gains  or  losses  of  short-term investment portfolios and similar transactions' of the income statement.\n\n## Market price\n\nThe  market  price  at  which,  if  applicable,  the  different categories of shares are valued, is determined as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Securities  traded  in  an  active  market  are  valued  at  their most recent price.\n- \u00b7 If the market on which the security is traded is not or is no longer considered to be active, or if the share is not listed, Amundi Finance determines the probable trading value of the  security  in  question  by  using  valuation  techniques. Firstly,  these  techniques  refer  to  recent  transactions carried  out  in  normal  competitive  conditions.  When appropriate, Amundi uses valuation techniques commonly used by market participants to value these securities when it  has  been  demonstrated  that  these  techniques  produce reliable  estimates  of  the  prices  obtained  in  actual  market trades.\n\n## Recording dates\n\nAmundi  records  securities  that  are  classified  as  long-term investment securities on the settlement/delivery date. Other securities,  regardless  of  their  nature  or  category  in  which they are classified, are recorded on the trading date.\n\n## Reclassification of securities\n\nIn  accordance  with  ANC  Regulation  2014-07,  the  following reclassifications are authorised:\n\n- \u00b7 Reclassification of trading portfolios as investment portfolios  or  short-term  investment  portfolios  in  case  of exceptional market situations or for fixed-income securities when they  can  no  longer  be  traded  on  an  active  market and if the establishment intends and is able to hold them for the foreseeable future or until maturity.\n- \u00b7 Short-term investment portfolios to long-term investment portfolios  in  the  case  of  exceptional  market  situations  or for  fixed-income  securities  when  they  can  no  longer  be traded on an active market.\n\nIn  2023,  Amundi  performed no reclassifications pursuant to ANC regulation 2014-07.\n\n## Buyback of treasury shares\n\nTreasury  shares  bought  back  by  Amundi  under  a  liquidity agreement  are  recorded  under  the  assets  of  the  balance sheet in a transaction portfolio for their inventory value.\n\nThe  treasury  shares  repurchased  by  Amundi  as  part  of hedging  the  allotment  of  bonus  shares  are  recognised  in  a marketable investment portfolio.  They  are  subjected,  where applicable,  to  a  write-down  if  the  book  value  is  lower  than the purchase price, with the exception of transactions related to  the  stock  option  plans  or  subscription  of  shares  and  the allotment  of  bonus  shares  for  employees  pursuant  to  ANC regulation 2014-07.\n\n7\n\n<!-- image -->",

In  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  this regulation,  the  depreciable  base  takes  account  of  the potential residual value of tangible fixed assets.\n\nThe purchase cost of fixed assets includes the purchase price plus  any  incidental  expenses,  namely  expenses  directly  or indirectly incurred in connection with bringing the asset into service or 'into inventory'.\n\nBuildings  and  equipment  are  recognised  at  purchase  cost less accumulated depreciation, amortisation and write-downs since they were commissioned.\n\nAcquired  software  is  measured  at  cost  less  accumulated depreciation, amortisation and write-downs since the acquisition date.\n\nIntangible  fixed  assets  other  than  software,  patents  and licences are not amortised. If applicable, they may be subject to a write-down.\n\nFixed assets are depreciated based on their estimated useful lives.\n\nThe  following  components  and  depreciation  periods  have been  adopted  by  Amundi  following  the  application  of component accounting for non-current fixed assets. It should be  remembered  that  these  depreciation  periods  should  be adapted to the nature of the construction and its location:\n\n| Component                               | Amortisation period   |\n|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------|\n| Technical facilities  and installations | 5 years               |\n| IT equipment                            | 3 years               |\n\nProprietary  software  is  measured  at  production  cost  less accumulated  depreciation,  amortisation  and  write-downs since completion.\n\n## 2.4 Liabilities due to credit institutions and clients\n\nLiabilities due to credit institutions and clients are presented in the financial statements according to their initial durations or their nature:\n\n- \u00b7 demand or term liabilities for credit institutions;\n- \u00b7 other liabilities for clients (including, in particular, financial clients).\n\nAccrued interest on these debts is registered under related payables through profit or loss.\n\n## 2.5 Debt securities\n\nDebt  securities  are  presented  according  to  the  type  of vehicle:  savings  certificates,  interbank  market  instruments, negotiable debt securities and bonds, excluding subordinated securities included in liabilities under 'Subordinated debt'.\n\nAccrued  interest  not  yet  due  on  these  debts  is  recognised under related payables through profit or loss.\n\n## 2.6 Provisions\n\nAmundi applies ANC Regulation 2014-03 for the recognition and measurement of provisions.\n\nThese  provisions  include  provisions  relating  to  financing  commitments,  retirement  and  end-of-career  liabilities,  litigation  and various risks.\n\nAll these risks are reviewed quarterly.\n\n## 2.7 Fund for general banking risks (FGBR)\n\nThe funds are set aside by Amundi at the discretion of its management to meet expenses or cover risks which may or may not materialise and which fall within the scope of banking activities.\n\nProvisions are released to cover any incidence of these risks during a financial year.\n\nAs at 31 December 2023, the balance of this account is \u20ac37,148,962.00.\n\n## 2.8 Financial futures instruments and options\n\nHedging  and  market  transactions  on  forward  financial instruments  involving  interest  rates,  foreign  exchange  or equities are recognised in accordance with the provisions of ANC regulation 2014-07.\n\nCommitments related to these transactions are recorded offbalance  sheet  at  the  nominal  value  of  the  contracts:  this amount represents the volume of transactions in progress.\n\nAt  31  December  2023,  financial  futures  commitments amounted to \u20ac573,840 thousand.\n\nThe  profit  (losses)  associated  with  these  transactions  are recognised according to the nature of the instrument and the strategy followed:\n\nShare  premiums  and  redemption  premiums  of  bond  issues are amortised over the life of the bonds in question, and the corresponding expense is recognised in the section 'Interest and  similar  expenses  on  bonds  and  other  fixed-income securities'.",

Moreover, only any unrealised  losses  are  recognised  via  a  provision.  Realised capital  gains  and  losses  are  recognised  in  the  income statement at the time of settlement;\n- \u00b7 when  part  of  a  trading  portfolio,  all  gains  and  losses (whether realised or unrealised) are recognised.\n\n## 2.9 Currency transactions\n\nAssets  and  liabilities  in  foreign  currencies  are  converted using the exchange rate at the end of the financial year. The gains  or  losses  resulting  from  these  conversions,  as  well  as the translation adjustments on the financial year's transactions, are recognised in the income statement.\n\nThe  monetary  receivables  and  liabilities,  as  well  as  the forward  currency  contracts  appearing  as  off-balance  sheet commitments  in  foreign  currencies  are  translated  at  the foreign  exchange  rate  prevailing  at  the  closing  date  or  the market price on the nearest preceding date.\n\n## 2.10 Off-balance sheet commitments\n\nOff-balance  sheet  items  track,  in  particular,  the  unused portion of financing commitments and guarantee commitments given and received.\n\nWhere applicable, provisions are allocated for commitments given when there is a probability of a loss for Amundi.\n\n## Counterparty risk on derivative instruments\n\nIn accordance  with  ANC  regulation  2014-07,  Amundi incorporates  the  assessment  of  the  counterparty  risk  on derivative assets in the market value of derivatives. As such, only  derivatives  recognised  in  isolated  open  positions  or  in trading portfolios (derivatives classified according to categories A and D of Article 2522-1 of the aforementioned regulation,  respectively)  are  subject  to  a  counterparty  risk calculation  on  active  derivatives.  (CVA  -  Credit  Valuation Adjustment) CVA.\n\nCVA makes it possible to determine expected counterparty losses from Amundi's perspective.\n\nThe CVA calculation relies on an assessment of the expected losses based on the probability of default and the loss in the event of default. The methodology used maximises the use of observable market data.\n\nIt is based on:\n\n- \u00b7 primarily,  market  parameters  such  as  listed  CDS  (Credit Default Swaps) or Single Name CDS or index CDS;\n- \u00b7 in the absence of CDS Single Name on the counterparty, an approximation  based  on  a  basket  of  CDS  Single  Name counterparties with the same rating, operating in the same sector and located in the same region.\n\n## Complex transactions\n\nA complex transaction is defined as a synthetic combination of instruments (types, natures and methods of valuation that are  identical  or  different)  recognised  as  a  single  lot  or  as  a transaction whose recognition does not pertain to an explicit regulation  and  that  involves  a  choice  of  principle  by  the institution.\n\nThe income and expenses relating to instruments traded as part  of  complex  transactions,  including  structured  bond issues, are recognised on the income statement symmetrically  with  the  accounting  of  the  income  and expenses  on  the  hedged  item.  Accordingly,  changes  in  the values  of  hedging  instruments  are  not  recognised  in  the balance sheet.\n\nWithin the context of the application of ANC regulation 201407, Amundi implemented multi-currency accounting enabling it  to  monitor its foreign exchange position and to assess its exposure to this risk.\n\nOff-balance  sheet  commitments  for  publication  do  not include  commitments  on  forward  financial  instruments  or foreign exchange transactions.\n\n7\n\n<!-- image -->",

Agreements regarding employee profit-sharing and incentive plans have been signed in this context.\n\n## 2.12 Post-employment benefits\n\n## Commitments in terms of retirement plans, pre-retirement and end-of-career payments defined benefit plans\n\nAmundi has applied Recommendation 2013-02 of the French Accounting  Standards  Authority  relating  to  the  rules  for booking  and  assessing  pension  obligations  and  similar benefits,  recommendation  repealed  and  included  in  ANC Regulation 2014-03.\n\nThis recommendation  was  amended  by  the  ANC  on 5  November  2021.  For  defined-benefit  plans  for  which benefits are conditional on length of service, are capped at a maximum amount and are conditional on a member of staff still being  employed  by  the  entity  when  they  reach retirement age, this recommendation permits entitlements to be allocated on a straight-line basis from:\n\n- \u00b7 either the employee's start date;\n- \u00b7 or the date from which each year of service is retained for the acquisition of benefits\n\nIn accordance  with  this  regulation,  Amundi  funds  its retirement  plans  and  similar  benefits  falling  under  the category of defined benefit plans.\n\nThese commitments are assessed based on a set of actuarial, financial  and  demographic  assumptions  and  using  the projected  unit  credit  method.  The  expense  is  calculated based on the future, discounted benefit.\n\nAs  at  2021,  Amundi  applies  the  determination  of  the distribution of benefits on a straight-line basis from the date on  which  each  service  year  is  used  for  the  acquisition  of benefits  (i.e.,  convergence  with  the  April  2021  IFRS  IC decision on IAS 19).\n\nProfit-sharing  and  incentives  are  shown  under  personnel expenses.\n\nEmployees  seconded  by  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  SA  operate  under agreements  signed  as  part  of  that  entity's  UES.  The estimated  expense  to  be  paid  for  the  profit-sharing  and incentive plans allocated in this context is recognised in the financial statements.\n\nThe sensitivity index shows that:\n\n- \u00b7 A  50  bp  increase  in  discount  rates  would  reduce  the commitment by 6.60%.\n- \u00b7 A  50  bp  drop  in  discount  rates  would  increase  the commitment by 7.17%.\n\nWithin  the  Amundi  Group,  Amundi  AM  has  entered  into  an insurance  contract  with  PREDICA  to  cover  end-of-career allowances (IFC) and mandate agreements have been signed between  Amundi  and  the  subsidiaries  of  the  UES.  This outsourcing  of  end-of-career  allowances  is  reflected  by transferring some of the existing liability provision from the books to the PREDICA contract.\n\nThe  non-outsourced  balance  is  still  recorded  under  the provision for liabilities.\n\n## Retirement plans - defined contribution plans\n\nEmployers  contribute  to  a  variety  of  compulsory  pension schemes. Plan assets are managed  by  independent organisations and the contributing companies have no legal or  implied  obligation  to  pay  additional  contributions  if  the funds  do  not  have  sufficient  assets  to  cover  all  benefits corresponding to services rendered by the employees during the financial year and during prior years.\n\nConsequently, Amundi has no liabilities in this respect other than its contributions for the year ended.\n\nThe amount of contributions under these pension schemes is recorded as 'personnel expenses'.",

(2) Quantity of equities on the basis of achieving performance conditions of 100%.\n\n## Stock options under the company savings plan\n\nSubscriptions for shares offered to employees under the company savings plan, at a maximum discount of 30%, are not subject to a vesting period but do have a five-year period during which they are inaccessible. These share subscriptions are recognised in accordance with the provisions relating to capital increases.\n\n## 2.14 Extraordinary income and expenses\n\nThese consist of expenses and income that occur on an exceptional basis and that are associated with operations that do not pertain to Amundi's ordinary business activities.\n\n7\n\n<!-- image -->",

It  includes  the consequences of the company's contribution on profits\n\nWhen tax credits on revenues from securities portfolios and receivables  are  effectively  used  to  pay  corporation  tax  due for  the  financial  year,  they  are  recognised  under  the  same heading as the income with which they are associated. The corresponding tax charge continues to be recognised under 'Corporate income tax' in the income statement.\n\nAmundi introduced a tax consolidation system in 2010. By 31 December  2019,  16  entities  had  signed  a  tax  consolidation agreement  with  Amundi.  Under  these  agreements,  each company  that  is  part  of  the  tax  consolidation  scheme recognises the tax that it would have paid in the absence of the scheme in its financial statements.\n\nFollowing the signature of a tax consolidation agreement on 15 April 2010, Amundi heads the tax consolidation group. In addition to Amundi S.A., this group comprises the following 17 companies:\n\n- \u00b7 CPR Asset Management;\n- \u00b7 Amundi Finance;\n- \u00b7 Amundi Intermediation;\n- \u00b7 Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale Gestion;\n- \u00b7 Amundi AM;\n- \u00b7 Amundi Immobilier;\n- \u00b7 Amundi Private Equity Funds;\n- \u00b7 Amundi ESR;\n- \u00b7 Amundi Finance Emissions;\n- \u00b7 LCL Emissions;\n- \u00b7 BFT Invest Manager;\n- \u00b7 Amundi India Holding;\n- \u00b7 Amundi Ventures;\n- \u00b7 Valinter 19;\n- \u00b7 Valinter 20;\n- \u00b7 SNC Amundi IT Services;\n- \u00b7 ANATEC.\n\n## Note 3 LOANS AND RECEIVABLES DUE FROM CREDIT INSTITUTIONS ANALYSIS BY REMAINING MATURITY\n\n|                                                  | 31/12/2023   | 31/12/2023         | 31/12/2023         | 31/12/2023   | 31/12/2023      | 31/12/2023       | 31/12/2023   | 31/12/2022   |\n|--------------------------------------------------|--------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------|-----------------|------------------|--------------|--------------|\n| (in \u20ac thousands)                                 | < 3 months   | > 3 month < 1 year | > 1 year < 5 years | > 5 years    | Total principal | Accrued interest | Total        | Total        |\n| Credit institutions                              |              |                    |                    |              |                 |                  |              |              |\n| Accounts and loans:                              |              |                    |                    |              |                 |                  |              |              |\n| \u00b7 Repayable on demand                            | 958,747      |                    |                    |              | 958,747         |                  | 958,747      | 1,217,025    |\n| \u00b7 At term                                        | 460,000      | 291,072            | 226,900            | 78,793       | 1,056,765       | 8,289            | 1,065,054    | 833,536      |\n| Securities received under  repurchase            |              |                    |                    |              |                 |                  |              |              |\n| Securities received under  repurchase agreements |              |                    |                    |              |                 |                  |              |              |\n| Subordinated loans                               |              |                    |                    |              |                 |                  |              | 100,008      |\n| Total                                            | 1,418,747    | 291,072            | 226,900            | 78,793       | 2,015,512       | 8,289            | 2,023,801    | 2,150,570    |\n| Impairments                                      |              |                    |                    |              |                 |                  |              |              |\n| NET CARRYING AMOUNT                              | 1,418,747    | 291,072            | 226,900            | 78,793       | 2,015,512       | 8,289            | 2,023,801    | 2,150,570    |\n| Current accounts                                 |              |                    |                    |              |                 | 4,248            | 4,248        | 4,248        |\n| Accounts and straight loans                      |              |                    |                    |              |                 |                  |              |              |\n| Total                                            |              |                    |                    |              |                 | 4,248            | 4,248        | 4,248        |\n| Impairments                                      |              |                    |                    |              |                 |                  |              |              |\n| NET CARRYING AMOUNT                              |              |                    |                    |              |                 | 4,248            | 4,248        | 4,248        |\n| TOTAL                                            | 1,418,747    | 291,072            | 226,900            | 78,793       | 2,015,512       | 12,537           | 2,028,049    | 2,154,818    |",

Our objective  is  to  obtain  reasonable  assurance  about  whether the  financial  statements  as  a  whole  are  free  from  material misstatement.  Reasonable  assurance  is  a  high  level  of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from  fraud  or  error  and  are  considered  material  if, individually  or  in  the  aggregate,  they  could  reasonably  be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nAs  specified  in  Article  L.821-55  of  the  French  Commercial Code  ( Code  de  commerce ),  our  statutory  audit  does  not include  assurance  on  the  viability  of  the  Company  or  the quality of management of the affairs of the Company.",

The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting  from  fraud  is  higher  than  for  one  resulting  from error,  as  fraud  may  involve  collusion,  forgery,  intentional omissions,  misrepresentations,  or  the  override  of  internal control.\n- \u00b7 Obtains  an  understanding  of  internal  control  relevant  to the  audit  in  order  to  design  audit  procedures  that  are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of  expressing  an  opinion  on  the  effectiveness  of  the internal control.\n- \u00b7 Evaluates the appropriateness of accounting policies used and  the  reasonableness  of  accounting  estimates  and related  disclosures  made  by  management  in  the  financial statements.\n\n## Report to the Audit Committee\n\nWe submit a report to the Audit Committee, which includes in particular a description of the scope of the audit and the audit  program  implemented,  as  well  as  the  results  of  our audit.  We  also  report,  if  any,  significant  deficiencies  in internal  control  regarding  the  accounting  and  financial reporting procedures that we have identified.\n\nOur  report  to  the  Audit  Committee includes  the  risks  of material  misstatement  that,  in  our  professional  judgment, were  of  most  significance  in  the  audit  of  the  financial statements of the current period and which are therefore the key  audit  matters  that  we  are  required  to  describe  in  this report.\n\n## Individual financial statements\n\nStatutory Auditors' report on the annual financial statements\n\n- \u00b7 Assesses the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence  obtained,  whether  a  material  uncertainty  exists related  to  events  or  conditions  that  may  cast  significant doubt  on  the  Company's  ability  to  continue  as  a  going concern.  This  assessment  is  based  on  the  audit  evidence obtained  up  to  the  date  of  his  audit  report.  However, future  events  or  conditions  may  cause  the  Company  to cease  to  continue  as  a  going  concern.  If  the  Statutory Auditor concludes that a material uncertainty exists, there is  a  requirement  to  draw  attention  in  the  audit  report  to the  related  disclosures  in  the  financial  statements  or,  if such disclosures are not provided or inadequate, to modify the opinion expressed therein.\n- \u00b7 Evaluates the overall presentation of the financial statements and assesses whether  these  statements represent  the  underlying  transactions  and  events  in  a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n\nWe also  provide  the  Audit  Committee  with  the  declaration provided  for  in  Article  6  of  Regulation  (EU)  N\u00b0  537/2014, confirming our independence within the meaning of the rules applicable  in  France  such  as  they  are  set  in  particular  by Articles L.821-27 to L.821-34 of the French Commercial Code ( Code de commerce ) and in the French Code of Ethics ( Code de  d\u00e9ontologie ) for  Statutory  Auditors .

The minimum and maximum number of members is set down by applicable law.\n\nEach  director  must  own  at  least  200  shares  during  his/her term of office.\n\nThe Board of Directors is renewed each year by rotation; this rotation will concern a certain number of Board members.\n\nThe General Meeting sets the length of a director's term of office at three years, subject to legal provisions allowing for any extension, to end with the Ordinary General Meeting of shareholders  deliberating  on  the  accounts  for  the  previous financial year and held in the year in which the said director's term of office comes to an end.\n\nExceptionally,  in  order  to  begin  or  maintain  the  above mentioned rotation, the General Meeting may appoint one or more directors for a different term of no more than 4 years, in  order to allow a staggered renewal of directors' terms of office. The duties of any director thus appointed for a term of no  more  than  4  years  will  end  with  the  Ordinary  General Meeting of shareholders deliberating on the accounts for the previous financial year and held in the year in which the said director's term of office comes to an end.\n\nThe number of directors who are natural persons and over 70 years of age may not exceed one-third of the total number of directors at the end of the financial year.

The Company shall keep a copy of the minutes in its records.\n\nIn  the  event  that  a  second  round  is  necessary,  it  shall  be organized within one week and no later than one month after the first round.\n\nThe  organisation  of  elections  and  their  requirements  are determined  by  the  Chief  Executive  Officer  and  shall  be displayed  at  least  five  weeks  prior  to  the  date  of  the  first round of the election.\n\nThe first round of the election for the renewal of the term of the  director  representing  the  staff  must  take  place  at  the latest two weeks prior to the end of its term of office.\n\nIn  the  event  that  elections  are  also  organised  in  the Company's  direct  or  indirect  subsidiaries,  whose  registered office are located in France, the Chief Executive Officer shall contact  such  subsidiaries'  legal  representatives  for  this purpose.\n\nThe  director  representing  the  staff  shall  not  be  taken  into account to determine the maximum number of directors as set forth in Article L. 225-17 of the French Commercial Code.\n\n## Article 12 Powers of the Board of Directors\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors  determines  the  Company's  strategy and ensures its implementation.Subject to powers expressly reserved to shareholder meetings, and within the limits of the corporate objects, the Board of Directors may deal with any issue concerning the smooth operation of the Company and will take decisions on matters concerning the Company.\n\nThe Board of Directors conducts all checks and inspections it deems necessary.

Any  lack  of  response  within  the  allotted  time will be equivalent to a vote against.\n\nThe  proposal,  if  approved,  will  be  documented  in  a  written record  of  the  Board's  decision,  which  will  be  submitted  for approval at the next meeting of the Board of Directors. All Directors' votes will be included in the notes to the minutes.\n\n## 4.5.

Minutes of Board of Directors' meetings\n\nThe deliberations by the Board of Directors shall be recorded in minutes, prepared  in  one  typed  copy,  numbered according  to  the  date  of  the  proceedings  to  which  they relate  and  paginated  consecutively.  These  minutes  shall  be recorded in a special register, signed by the Chairman of the session and at least one Director (they shall be signed by two Directors  if  the  Chairman  of  the  session  is  unable  to  sign them) and kept in accordance with regulatory provisions.\n\nThe minutes of each session shall contain:\n\n- \u00b7 the  name  of  the  directors  that  were  present  -  whether physically or via a videoconference or other telecommunications link - represented, excused or absent, as  well  as  the  name  of  any  other  person  who  attended either the entire meeting or part of it;\n- \u00b7 an  account  of  the  Board  of  Directors'  discussions  and deliberations,  and  the  questions  raised  and  reservations expressed by the participating members; and\n- \u00b7 if  applicable,  the  occurrence  of  any  technical  incident relating to a videoconference or conference call, where this disrupted the smooth running of the session.\n\nCopies or extracts of those minutes that are to be produced in  court,  or  formal  deliberations,  shall  be  validly  certified  as being  true  to  the  original  by  the  Chairman,  the  Chief Executive  Officer  or  a  Deputy  Chief  Executive  Officer,  any Director to whom the functions of the Chairman have been temporarily  delegated,  the  Secretary  of  the  Board  or  a proxyholder who has been duly authorised for this purpose.\n\nThe  Chairman  of  the  committee  shall  lead  the  discussions and  shall  report  the  recommendations  made  by  the committee to the Board of Directors.\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors  may  refer  to  each  committee  any specific request falling within its area of responsibilities, and may  ask  the  Chairman  of  each  committee  to  convene  a meeting with a specific agenda.\n\nEach committee may meet by any means, including via video or  teleconference.  It  may  also  give  its  opinion  by  written consultation.\n\nIn order to validly deliberate or give an opinion, at least half of  the  members  of  a  committee  must  be  present.  The opinions  and  recommendations  that  a  committee  gives  to the Board of Directors shall be adopted upon a majority vote by those of its members that are present or represented.\n\nMinutes must be taken for each Committee meeting and sent to  the  members  of  the  said  committee.  The  minutes  must record the opinion of every member of the committee, if the latter so requests.\n\nEach committee may, on an ad hoc basis, seek the opinion of any person, including third parties, that is likely to inform its discussions.",

Responsibilities of the Appointment Committee\n\nThe Appointment Committee shall have the following remits (in  accordance  with,  in  particular,  Article  L.  511-98  of  the French Monetary and Financial Code), under the responsibility of the Board of Directors, to:\n\n- \u00b7 identify  and  recommend  to  the  Board  of  Directors candidates  that  are  suitable  for  appointment  as  Board Members  and  that  have  been  proposed  to  the  General\n- Shareholders'  Meeting  by  the  shareholders,  annually assessing the criteria for determining the independence of Board Members who are considered independent;\n- \u00b7 evaluate, on an annual basis, the balance and the diversity of  the  knowledge,  skills  and  experience  that  the  Board Members  possess  individually  and  collectively,  as  well  as the structure, the size, the composition and the effectiveness of the tasks of the Board, and submitting any appropriate recommendations to it;\n- \u00b7 set an objective to achieve balanced representation of men and  women  and  developing  a  policy  to  achieve  this objective;\n- \u00b7 periodically review the policies for selecting and appointing  the  members  of  Senior  Management  and  the head of risk management, as well as the governing bodies of  all  Group  companies  and  making  recommendations  in this regard; and\n- \u00b7 ensure that the Board is not dominated by one person or a small group of individuals in a way that is harmful to the interests of the institution.\n\n## 8.5 REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT\n\nAmundi's  activities  are  governed  by  regulations  specific  to each  country  in  which  the  Group  operates,  directly  or through subsidiaries or partnerships. With regard to its main activity  -  asset  management  -  Amundi  is  subject  to numerous regulations, prudential supervision and authorisation  requirements  (for  companies  performing  a regulated  activity  and  for  savings  products).  In  addition, several Group entities, including the Company, are authorised as credit institutions and therefore subject to monitoring by banking supervisors.\n\nAmundi  is  subject  to  the  laws  and  regulations  governing asset management activities, including requirements relating to  internal  organisation  and  good  conduct,  supervisory requirements,  investment  and  asset  allocation  rules,  rules\n\nrelating to the prevention of money laundering, rules relating to  the  identification  and  knowledge  of  clients  (\"Know  Your Customer\"  or  \"KYC\")  and  rules  relating  to  international sanctions,  including  those  issued  by  the  Office  of  Foreign Assets Control of the US Department of the Treasury, which are applicable to Amundi at international level.\n\nThe  regulations applicable to Amundi  are  constantly evolving,  particularly  within  the  European  Union  (\"EU\"). These regulations could also change as a result of the United Kingdom's departure from the European Union (\"Brexit\").\n\nAny  new  regulations  or  changes  in  the  implementation  or application of the laws and regulations in force could, where applicable,  have  a  significant  impact  on  Amundi's  activities and operating income.\n\n## 8.5.1 Regulations relating to asset management activities\n\n## 8.5.1.1 European Union\n\n## 8.5.1.1.1 General Presentation\n\nAmundi's  asset  management  activities  can  be  divided  into two main categories:\n\n- \u00b7 portfolio  management  and  investment  advice,  governed by the MiFID II regulations;\n- \u00b7 the  management  of  funds  and  other  undertakings  for collective  investment,  including  UCITS-type  funds  and AIFs,  governed  by  the  UCITS  Directive  and  the  AIFM Directive, respectively.\n\nIn addition to these principal legislative texts, asset management activities are affected by other regulations and proposed  reforms  at  the  European  level,  such  as  the regulations  applicable  to  financial  derivatives  (European Market  Infrastructure  Regulation,  EMIR),  the  regulations intended  to  provide  a  structure  for  the  \"shadow  banking system\" or the regulations applicable to sustainable finance\n\n(in  particular,  Regulation  (EU)  2019/2088  of  the  European Parliament and of the Council of 27 November 2019 on the publication  of  sustainability  information  in  the  financial services  sector  and  Regulation  (EU)  2020/852  of  the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 June 2020 on establishing a framework to encourage sustainable investment) .\n\nAlthough  laws  and  regulations  vary  from  one  country  to another,  the  texts  transposing  the  EU  legislation  in  each Member State are substantially similar in all the countries in which  Amundi  operates,  in  particular  in  France,  Italy, Germany,  Austria,  Spain  and  Luxembourg.  However,  the legislative  transposition  of  the  Directives  in  each  European country or their interpretation by local supervisory authorities may give rise to different approaches and in some cases delays.",

        "page_content": "## European passport system\n\nOne of the objectives of the European regulatory framework is  to  facilitate  the  cross-border  marketing  of  investment products  in  Europe.  The  European  passport  allows  a management  company  that  has  been  authorised  by  the regulator  of  its  country  of  origin  to  conduct  its  activities  in the EU or in signatory states of the European Economic Area (EEA) Agreement under the freedom to provide services and the freedom of establishment. A management company that wishes to conduct activities, for which it has been approved, in another State must inform the competent authorities of its origin  Member  State.  In  the  host  Member  State,  the management  company  may  only  conduct  the  activities covered by the approval granted in its origin Member State.\n\nFor asset management, a passport can be granted for three types of activity: (i) management of UCITS, (ii) management of  AIFs  and  (iii)  portfolio  management  on  behalf  of  third parties.  The  passport  may  also  cover  other  investment services such as receiving/transmitting orders and executing orders on behalf of third parties. The passport system allows Amundi  entities  to  benefit  from  conducting  cross-border activities in the EU.\n\n## Capital requirements\n\nPursuant  to  the  various  regulatory  regimes  which  apply  to asset management activities, a number of Group entities are subject to minimum capital requirements which are typically equal  to  the  higher  of  the  following  amounts:  25%  of  the previous  year's  general  expenses,  or  \u20ac125,000  plus  an amount  equal  to  0.02%  of  assets  under  management  in excess of \u20ac250 million (plus an additional minimum of 0.01% of the value of the portfolios of AIFs under management for regulated  entities  subject  to  the  AIFM  Directive).  These capital  requirements  are  significantly  more  restrictive  than those  applicable  to  Amundi  under  the  current  banking regulations. See paragraph  8.5.2 \"Banking regulations applicable to Amundi\".\n\n## Regulations applicable to compensation policies\n\nThe AIFM, UCITS and Capital Requirements Directives govern the  compensation  policies  of  credit  institutions,  investment service providers and AIF managers in order to ensure that these policies are compatible with the principles of good risk management  (see  section  2.4  \"Compensation  of  identified staff\"). In addition, Directive (EU) 2019/2034 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 November 2019 on the prudential supervision of investment firms (the \"IFD Directive\")  described  below  (see  below  section  8.5.2.2)  has created  a  specific  compensation  regime  for  investment companies,  which  has  been  applicable  to  some  of  the Group's subsidiaries since the 2022 financial year (for more information  on  the  aspects  relating  to  compensation,  see section 2.4).\n\n## 8.5.1.1.2 Regulations applicable to providing investment services\n\n## Applicable legal framework\n\nThe  Group's  investment  service  providers  are  obliged  to comply with Directive 2014/65/EU  of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 May 2014 on markets in financial instruments (\"MiFID II\"), which governs the provision of  these services, including portfolio management activities, also  known  as  discretionary  management,  as  well  as investment  advice  and  the  order  receipt  and  transmission service.\n\nThis  regulation  sets  out,  in  particular,  (i)  requirements  in terms  of  internal  organisation,  (ii)  obligations  of  good conduct  to  ensure  the  protection  of  investors  through enhanced information requirements, assessments of adequacy and suitability for clients, the execution of orders under the most favourable conditions for clients and rules for handling  client  orders,  (iii)  enhanced  management  of  the commissions  paid  in  connection  with  the  provision  of investment advice, (iv) an increase in pre- and post-trading transparency requirements and their extension to additional financial instruments, and (v) an increase in the powers of the competent authorities. The applicable rules then depend on the type of client, with a high degree of protection for nonprofessional  clients  and,  conversely,  flexibility  allowed  in relations with professional investors.\n\n## Enhanced information requirements\n\nMiFID II imposes increased obligations on investment service providers  in  terms  of  client  information  when  providing investment services, particularly investment advice. Regulated  entities  must  provide  clear  and  appropriate guidelines and warnings regarding the risks associated with financial  instruments  and,  in  particular,  indicate  to  clients whether  the  range  of  instruments  offered  to  them  is established  or  provided  by  entities  with  links  and  relations with  the  entity  offering  the  advice  services.  Furthermore, MiFID II introduces additional information obligations regarding the breakdown of the price of financial instruments and services. The client must be informed of the cumulative amount of costs and charges relating to investment services and ancillary services.\n\nNew  requirements  arising  from  Commission  Delegated Regulation  (EU)  2021/1253  of  21  April  2021  have  been introduced  to  integrate  ESG  preferences  into  investor product  suitability  tests  and  sustainability  factors  into  the internal  organisation  of  investment  companies.  Similarly, Commission Delegated Directive (EU) 2021/1269 of 21  April  2021  provides  for  the  integration  of  sustainability factors  when  defining  a  target  market,  requiring  firms  to specify  the  types  or  groups  of  clients  with  whose  ESG preferences the proposed product is compatible.\n\n## Regulation of commissions\n\nMiFID II reinforces the protection of investors with regard to payments that a company may receive or pay to third parties during  the  provision  of  investment  services.  Companies providing  investment  advice  in  an  independent  manner  or conducting  portfolio  management  activities  are  prohibited from  collecting  fees,  commissions  or  monetary  or  nonmonetary benefits from third parties. Certain minor benefits of a non-monetary nature are allowed, but the client must be clearly informed of these.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

The client must be clearly informed of the existence, nature and amount of such commissions, in a comprehensive, precise  and  understandable  manner,  before the provision of any service.\n\n## 8.5.1.1.3 Regulations applicable to the fund\n\n## Regulations applicable to UCITS-type funds\n\nAmundi entities that manage and market UCITS-type funds in the  EU  must  comply  with  the  organisational  requirements and the rules of good conduct set out in Directive 2009/65/ EC  of  the  European  Parliament  and  of  the  Council  of  13 July  2009  on  the  coordination  of  laws,  regulations  and administrative provisions relating to undertakings for collective  investment  in  transferable  securities  (UCITS),  as regards  depositary  functions,  compensation  policies  and sanctions (the \"UCITS Directive\").\n\nUCITS  are  undertakings  for  collective  investment  (\"UCIs\") (i)  for  which  the  sole  aim  is  the  collective  investment  in transferable  securities  or  in  other  liquid  financial  assets  of capital raised from the public and the operation of which is subject  to  the  principle  of  risk  diversification,  and  (ii)  the units  of  which  can  be,  at  the  request  of  the  unitholders, redeemed  or  reimbursed,  directly  or  indirectly, from their assets.\n\nIn  terms  of  internal  organisation,  strict  rules  must  be respected, including requirements relating to the management of risks and conflicts of interest, as well as the rules of good conduct, particularly in relation to information to  be  provided  to  clients  and  the  amount  of  commissions. UCITS assets must be held by a depositary that is a separate entity.  The  activities  of  depositaries  are  governed  by  rules relating  to  entities  eligible  for  this  function,  covering  their tasks, responsibilities and delegation agreements.\n\nIn addition, UCITS-type funds are subject to rules relating to the allocation and diversification of assets and should not, in particular, invest more than (i) 5% of the assets in securities or  money  market  instruments  issued  by  the  same  entity  or (ii) 20% of its assets in deposits with the same entity.\n\nAsset  management  companies  in  the  Amundi  Group  were required  to  prepare  a  short  document  containing  key information for investors (Key Investor Information Document or KIIID) for each of the UCITS they manage. This document  was  replaced  on  1  January  2023  by  the  Key Information  Document  (KID),  a  standardised  document applicable  to  savings  products  under  the  PRIIPS  regulation. The format of the new document must contain summarised information on the key characteristics of the funds concerned, in particular the identification of the fund, a brief description  of  its  investment  objectives  and  investment policy,  a  presentation  of  performance  scenarios,  details  of charges over time and risk indicators using a new calculation method.  Management  companies  must  also  publish  a prospectus containing the information necessary for investors to be able to make an informed judgement about the  investment  offered  to  them  and,  in  particular,  the associated risks.\n\nThe  prohibition  of  commissions  in  respect  of  independent investment advice does not apply to the commissions paid to entities  in  the  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole,  Soci\u00e9t\u00e9  G\u00e9n\u00e9rale,  UniCredit, BAWAG and Banco Sabadell  networks,  in  accordance  with the distribution agreements with these networks.\n\nNew  changes  to  the  regulation  of  commissions  for distribution  networks  are  being  discussed  by  the  European authorities,  but  at  this  stage  it  is  not  possible  to  draw  any final conclusions.\n\n## Regulations applicable to AIF managers\n\nAmundi's activities are impacted by Directive 2011/61/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 8 June 2011 on Alternative Investment Fund Managers (the \"AIFM Directive\"), which imposes strict regulatory requirements on alternative investment fund (\"AIF\") managers.\n\nAIFs are defined as UCIs (other than UCITS-type funds) that raise  capital  from  a  number  of  investors,  with  a  view  to investing  this  capital  for  the  benefit  of  the  investors  in accordance with a defined investment policy.\n\nThe AIFM Directive imposes additional requirements in terms of organisation, governance, information and asset allocation, and requires AIF assets to be held by depositaries that are independent of the manager and the AIF.\n\nAIF  managers  must  report  on  a  regular  basis  to  the competent authorities of their home Member State on behalf of  the  AIFs  they  manage.  In  particular,  they  must  provide information  on  (i)  the  main  instruments  in  which  each  AIF invests,  (ii)  the  markets  to  which  each  AIF  belongs  or  is active, and (iii) the most  important exposures and concentrations  for  each  AIF.  In  addition,  AIF  managers  are subject  to  enhanced  obligations  to  provide  investors  with information.  They  must,  for  each  EU  AIF  that  they  manage and  for  each  AIF  that  they  market  in  the  EU,  prepare  an annual report no later than six months after the end of the financial  year.  Before  any  investment,  managers  must  also make a list of information available to investors, including a description of the AIF investment strategy and objectives, a description of the procedures by which the AIF may change its  investment  strategy  or  policy,  a  description  of  the  AIF valuation  procedure  and  the  method  for  fixing  the  price  of the assets, a description of the management of the liquidity risk of the AIF and a description of all commissions, charges and  expenses  (including  the  maximum  amounts  of  these) that are directly or indirectly borne by the investors.\n\nEuropean  managers  may,  under  certain  conditions,  market European or non-European AIF units or shares within the EU through the passport scheme.\n\nIt is noteworthy that the method for calculating performance fees has been adjusted to comply with ESMA's recommendations, following the publication by the European Securities  and  Markets  Authority  (ESMA)  on  5  November 2020 of its guidance on performance fees in UCITS and AIFs, which  has  been  integrated  into  AMF  policy  (position  DOC2021-01 of 5 January 2021).",

By this position, the AMF has clarified its expectations vis-\u00e0-vis management companies in terms  of  information  provided  to  investors  by  funds incorporating non-financial approaches. This position applies to UCIs with a non-financial aspect authorised for marketing in France to a client base of non-professional investors. The information  sent  to  investors  must  be  proportionate  to  the actual and measurable consideration of non-financial features.  The  implementation  of  this  doctrine  involves updating, if necessary, the regulatory documentation, commercial  documentation  and  the  name  of  the  existing funds.\n\n## SFDR regulation\n\nThe portfolio management companies of the Amundi Group which provide portfolio management services (undertakings for  collective  investment  or  \"UCIs\",  or  asset  management mandates) or investment advisory services are subject to the provisions  of  Regulation  (EU)  2019/2088  of  the  European Parliament and of the Council of 27 November 2019 on the publication  of  sustainability  information  in  the  financial services  sector  (the  \"SFDR  Regulation\",  for  Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation).\n\nIn  this  respect,  they  must  in  particular  communicate  and identify the  SFDR  classification  applicable  to  financial products  and  comply  with  the  transparency  obligations  set out  in  the  SFDR.  They  are  also  required  to  amend,  where applicable, the documentation  of  UCIs  and  mandates covered  by  the  SFDR,  and  must  prepare  a  pre-contractual information document for investors.\n\nAlong with the SFDR, the portfolio management companies of the Amundi Group must also comply with the provisions of Regulation  (EU)  2020/852  of  the  European  Parliament  and of  the  Council  of  18  June  2020  on  the  establishment  of  a framework to facilitate sustainable investment (the \"Taxonomy  Regulation\").  This  text,  which  comes  into  force on  1  January  2022,  establishes  a  classification  system  for environmentally sustainable economic activities in addition to the  transparency  requirements  introduced  by  the  SFDR regulation.\n\n## Regulations applicable to money market funds\n\nMoney market funds are AIFs or UCITS-type funds investing in  short-term  liquid  assets  with  the  aim  of  offering  yields comparable to those of the money market and/or preserving the value of the investment. Regulation (EU) 2017/1131 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 14 June 2017 on money  market  funds  (the  \"MMF  Regulation\")  establishes uniform  operating  rules  at  a  European  level  to  make  these funds more resilient, limit the risks of financial instability and guarantee the equitable treatment of investors. This regulation applies to UCITS-type funds or AIFs for which the management and marketing are subject  to  approval.  These rules apply cumulatively with existing rules laid down by the UCITS  and  AIFM  regulations,  unless  otherwise  stipulated  in the regulations.\n\nMoney  market  funds  must  obtain  specific  approval  before being managed or marketed. The investment policy is framed by  the  requirements  for  eligible  assets,  concentration  and diversification  of  asset  portfolios.  The  money  market  fund manager must also establish a crisis simulation system as well as  internal  appraisal  procedures  to  determine  the  credit quality  of  the  money  market  instruments.  Furthermore, procedures  must  be  documented,  validated,  permanently applied and periodically reviewed.\n\nThe  MMF  regulations  submit  money  market  funds  to increased transparency requirements. The assets of a money market  fund  must  be  valued  at  least  every  day,  with publication of the daily valuation on the money market fund's website.\n\nMoney  market  funds  are  also  subject  to  weekly  disclosure obligations vis-\u00e0-vis investors relating to the composition of the  portfolio,  including  breakdowns  by  maturity,  credit profile, total asset value and net yield.\n\n## 8.5.1.1.4 EMIR regulation\n\nAmundi  activities  relating  to  derivative  instruments  are subject  to  Regulation  (EU)  648/2012  of  the  European Parliament  and  of  the  Council  of  4  July  2012  on  OTC derivatives, central counterparties and trade repositories (the \"EMIR\"). This regulatory framework mandates (i) centralised clearing  of  certain  categories  of  standardised  over-thecounter derivatives (\"OTC  derivatives\"), (ii) reporting requirements  for all derivatives transactions and  (iii) implementing risk mitigation techniques (such as collateralisation)  for  OTC  derivatives  that  are  not  centrally cleared.\n\n## 8.5.1.1.5 Supervision of the so-called parallel banking sector\n\n## Securities financing transactions\n\nRegulation (EU) 2015/2365 of the European Parliament and of  the  Council  of  25  November  2015  on  transparency  of securities  financing  transactions  and  of  reuse  is  targeted  at the transparency of these transactions and the limitation of associated  risks.  Three  types  of  obligation  have  been introduced  for  fund  managers:  (i)  an  obligation  to  report securities financing transactions to trade repositories of data, (ii)  an  obligation  to  publish  information  on  the  use  of securities  financing  transactions  and  total  return  swaps  and (iii)  a  framework  for  the  reuse  of  collateralised  financial instruments.\n\n## Packaged investment products\n\nRegulation  (EU)  No  1286/2014  of  the  European  Parliament and of the Council of 26 November 2014 on key information documents  for  packaged  retail  investment  and  insurancebased products (the \"PRIIPS Regulation\") aims to standardise the  pre-contractual  information  provided  to  retail  investors (within  the  meaning  of  MIFID  II)  for  investment  products whose performance depends on underlying assets (such as UCITS and AIFs, structured deposits, structured bonds, unitlinked  life  insurance  policies,  etc.).  The  PRIIPS  regulations also apply to securities or units of securitisation vehicles.\n\nSince  1  January  2023,  the  provider  of  these  products  has been  required  to  produce  an  accurate,  fair  and  clear  Key Information  Document  (KID)  presenting  the  terms  and conditions  of  the  product,  so  that  retail  investors  have  the basic information they need to understand and compare the product.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

The SFDR defines harmonised rules applicable to certain financial market  participants,  including  management  companies,  on the subject of publishing information on sustainable investment  and  sustainability  risks.  These  participants  are required to take environmental, social and governance (ESG) risks  into  account  in  their  investments  and  must  provide information on the main negative impacts of their investment policy  on  these  ESG  factors.  The  SFDR  also  provide  for enhanced transparency requirements for products, highlighting  ESG  characteristics  and  so-called  sustainable investments.  The  Regulation  came  into  force  on  10  March 2021, but Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2022/1288 of 6 April 2022 defining the content and presentation of the information to be provided by the financial market players in question has only been applicable since 1 January 2023.\n\n## 8.5.1.2 France\n\nThe  French  regulatory  framework  applicable  to  Amundi's asset  management  activities  mainly  reflects  the  European framework described above.\n\n## 8.5.1.2.1 French regulatory and supervisory bodies\n\n## Autorit\u00e9 de contr\u00f4le prudentiel et de r\u00e9solution (ACPR, French Prudential Supervision and Resolution Authority)\n\nThe ACPR has a dual mission: to oversee credit institutions, investment  companies  and  insurance  companies,  and  to ensure the protection of consumers and the stability of the financial  system.  In  its  supervisory  role,  the  ACPR  grants approvals  to  investment  companies  and  credit  institutions and ensures that they comply with the applicable laws and regulations  and  the  conditions  of  their  approval,  and  also monitors  their  financial  positions  (subject  to  the  powers devolved to the ECB (see below)). The ACPR has the powers of  administrative  policing  and  sanction  over  the  supervised entities.  Certain  powers  of  supervision  and  sanction  with regard  to  credit  institutions,  previously  entrusted  to  the ACPR,  were  transferred  to  the  European  Central  Bank in  November  2014.

Following  the  publication  of  the  RTS (Regulatory Technical Standards), elements of the Taxonomy Regulation have been added to the information required by the  SFDR  Regulation,  in  particular  for  products  covered  by Articles 8 and 9.\n\nIn terms  of  indices,  Regulation  (EU)  2016/1011  of  the European Parliament and of the Council  of  8  June  2016  on indices  used  as  benchmarks  for  financial  instruments  and contracts  or  to  measure  the  performance  of  investment funds (the Benchmark  Regulation) creates two new European  low-carbon  indices,  the  EU  Climate  Transition Benchmark  and  the  EU  Paris-Aligned  Benchmark,  with enhanced  transparency  requirements,  to  provide  investors with improved information on companies' carbon footprints and investment portfolios.\n\non the management activities envisaged and on the financial and  organisational  capacity  of  the  applicant  companies. Portfolio management companies can apply for authorisation for two different activities, namely: (i) management of UCITS and  (ii)  management  of  AIFs.  Depending  on  the  approval granted,  the  portfolio  management  companies  may  also propose  investment  services,  defined  by  MiFID  II,  such  as portfolio management for a third party, providing investment advice or receiving and transmitting orders.\n\nWhen  authorised  to  manage  both  UCITS-type  funds  and AIFs,  portfolio  management  companies  must  comply  with the regulations applicable to these two activities cumulatively, unless otherwise stipulated. The AMF monitors the compliance of portfolio management companies with the laws and regulations applicable to them and the conditions of  their  approval  and  has  the  power  to  sanction  any  party breaching these regulations.\n\n## 8.5.1.2.2 Provisions on the prevention of money laundering, terrorist financing and corruption\n\nInvestment service providers (portfolio management companies,  investment  companies  and  credit  institutions authorised  to  provide  investment  services)  are  required  to report to an anti-money laundering unit under the authority of  the  French  Minister  of  the  Economy,  known  as  Tracfin (Treatment of Information and Action Against Illicit Financial Circuits),  any  transaction  involving  sums  which  they  know, suspect  or  have  good  reason  to  suspect,  originate  from  an offence punishable by a custodial sentence of more than one year or which are linked to the financing of terrorism.",

They must also establish systems for  assessing  and  managing  the  risks  of  money  laundering and  the  financing  of  terrorism  that  are  customised  to  the transactions,  clients  and  suppliers  concerned.  They  are  also required  to  implement  a  corruption  prevention  programme. On  20  July  2021,  the  European  Commission  presented  a legislative  package  aimed  at  strengthening  the  EU  rules  on anti-money  laundering  and  countering  the  financing  of terrorism (AML/CFT), as well as a proposal to set up a new European  authority  to  combat  money  laundering.  This legislative  package  is  composed  of  (i)  a  draft  regulation establishing  the  Anti-Money  Laundering  Authority  (AMLA),\n\nRegulatory environment\n\n(ii) a proposal for a new regulation on the prevention of the use  of  the  financial  system  for  the  purposes  of  money laundering  or  the  financing  of  terrorism,  (iii)  a  proposal  for Directive  (EU)  2015/849  (\"AMLD  6\")  and  (iv)  a  draft regulation amending Regulation (EU) 2015/847 on information  accompanying  transfers  of  funds  and  some crypto  assets.  Under  the  current  timetable,  the  legislative proposals are expected to be adopted in 2023.\n\nThe creation of a European Anti-Money Laundering Authority is  one element of this legislative package. The authority will directly  supervise  certain  entities  that  meet  cross-border criteria, coordinate national authorities, facilitate cooperation between financial intelligence units and issue guidelines and recommendations  on  the  implementation  of  the  legislative package, which will include, through a new regulation, more harmonised  and  granular  rules  in  terms  of  AML-CFT  risk management and customer due diligence.\n\n## 8.5.2 Banking regulations applicable to Amundi\n\n## 8.5.2.1 Banking regulatory and supervisory bodies\n\n## Banking supervisory authorities\n\nOn 15 October 2013, the EU adopted a regulation establishing a single supervisory mechanism for credit institutions in the eurozone or in a country where there is an opt-in system (the \"ECB  Single Supervisory Mechanism\"), which granted specific tasks to the European Central Bank (ECB) regarding the prudential supervision of credit institutions. This regulation  granted  the  ECB,  together  with  the  competent national  regulators,  direct  supervisory  powers  over  certain European  credit  institutions  and  banking  groups,  including the  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  group.  As  Amundi  is  part  of  the  Cr\u00e9dit Agricole group, several Group entities are supervised directly by  the  ECB,  including  the  Company  and  Amundi  Finance, while  other  Group  entities  are  supervised  by  the  ACPR,  for example Amundi Interm\u00e9diation and Amundi ESR.\n\nThe ECB fully assumed its supervisory role within the context of  the  European  regulation  as  implemented  under  French law  and  the  guidelines  and  recommendations  of  the European Banking Authority (EBA) on 4 November 2014 as well as its responsibilities within the ECB Single Supervisory Mechanism, in close coordination, in France, with the ACPR (the  ACPR  and  the  ECB  each  being  hereinafter  a  \"banking supervisory authority\").\n\n## Supervisory framework\n\nThe  competent  banking  supervisory  authority  shall  take individual  decisions,  instruct  and  issue  approvals  to  credit institutions and investment firms and grant specific exemptions  in  accordance  with  the  prevailing  banking regulations.  The  Authority  ensures  observance  by  credit institutions and investment firms of the applicable laws and regulations  and  the  conditions  for  their  approval,  and monitors their financial positions.\n\nThe  competent  banking  supervisory  authority  may  require credit institutions and investment companies to comply with the  applicable  regulations  and  cease  activities  that  may adversely  affect  clients'  interests.  The  competent  banking supervisory authority may also require a financial institution to  take  necessary  measures  to  reinforce  or  restore  its financial  position,  improve  its  management methods and/or adjust its organisational structure and activities to achieve its objectives.  If the  solvency  or  liquidity  of  a  financial institution or the clients' interests are, or could  be, threatened,  the  competent  banking  supervisory  authority may  take  certain  provisional  measures  such  as:  submitting the  establishment  to  specific  monitoring,  restricting  or prohibiting  the  conduct  of  certain  activities  (including  the collection  of  deposits),  the  settlement  of  certain  payments, the  sale  of  certain  assets,  the  distribution  of  dividends  to shareholders, and/or the payment of variable compensation. The  competent  banking  supervisory  authority  may  also require credit institutions to maintain their regulatory capital level  and/or  their  liquidity  ratios  at  a  higher  level  than  that required  by  the  applicable  regulations  and  submit  them  to specific liquidity requirements, including in terms of maturity mismatches between assets and liabilities.\n\nIn the event  of  non-compliance  with  the  applicable regulations,  the  competent  banking  supervisory  authority may impose administrative sanctions, such as warnings, fines, suspension  or  dismissal  of  directors  and  withdrawal  of approval, which would, where necessary, lead to the windingup  procedure  of  the  institution  concerned.  The  competent banking supervisory authority also has the power to appoint a provisional  administrator  to  temporarily  manage  an establishment  that  it  considers  to  be  poorly  managed. Insolvency  proceedings  may  only  be  opened  against  credit institutions or investment companies after the prior approval of  the  competent  banking  supervisory  authority  has  been obtained.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Since  1  January  2016,  a  Single  Resolution  Board  (SRB)  has been  responsible  for  planning  and  preparing  resolution decisions  for  cross-border  credit  institutions  and  banking groups,  and  for  credit  institutions  and  banking  groups directly  supervised  by  the  ECB  in  the  Eurozone  Banking\n\n## 8.5.2.2 Banking regulations\n\nIn  France,  credit  institutions  must  comply  with  the  financial management  standards  defined  by  the  European  regulations and  by  the  Ministry  of  the  Economy,  the  primary  purpose  of which is  to  ensure  the  solvency  and  liquidity  of  French  credit institutions.\n\nThese  banking  regulations  are  composed  primarily  of  and/or are  derived  from  the  CRD/CRR  regulations  and  comprise (i) Directive 2013/36/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council  of  26  June  2013  on  access  to  the  activity  of  credit institutions and the prudential supervision of credit institutions and  investment  firms,  as  amended  in  particular  by  Directive (EU) 2019/878 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 May 2019 transposed into French law by Order No. 20201635 of 21 December 2020 on various provisions for adapting the legislation to European Union financial law (the \"CRD\") and (ii)  Regulation  (EU)  No.  575/2013  of  the  European  Parliament and of the Council of 26 June 2013 on prudential requirements for  credit  institutions  and  investment  firms,  as  amended  in particular  by  Regulation  (EU)  2019/876  of  the  European Parliament and of the Council of 20 May 2019 (the \"CRR\").\n\nAccording  to  these  regulations,  credit  institutions  must comply with minimum capital requirements. The requirements arising from these regulations that apply to Amundi  in  terms  of  solvency  and  capital  adequacy  are described in section 5.4 \"Solvency and capital adequacy\" of this  Universal  Registration  Document.  In  addition  to  these requirements,  the  primary  obligations  applicable  to  credit institutions relate to diversifying risks and liquid assets held, monetary  policy,  restrictions  on  equity  investments  and  on engaging in other non-banking activities, reporting requirements,  the  implementation  of  appropriate  internal controls  and  a  compensation  policy  consistent  with  sound and  effective  risk  management,  and  combating  money laundering and the financing of terrorism.\n\nFinally,  banking  regulations  impose  information  obligations on credit institutions. They must provide information on their objectives  and  policies  in  terms  of  risk  management, governance  procedures,  compliance  with  capital  adequacy requirements  and  compensation  that  have  a  significant impact  on  the  leverage  and  risk  profile.  In  addition,  the French  Monetary  and  Financial  Code  imposes  additional information requirements on credit institutions,  which  must, in particular, provide  information  on  certain  financial indicators,  their  activities  in  non-cooperative  States  or territories,  and  more  generally,  information  about  their locations and activities in each State or territory.\n\nUnion, such as the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole group. The ACPR remains responsible for implementing  the  resolution plans in accordance with the SRB's instructions.\n\nThe  \"resolution  authority\"  refers  to  the  ACPR,  SRB  and/or any  other  national  authority  authorised  to  exercise  or participate  in  the  exercise  of  internal  bailout  powers (including  the  Council  of  the  European  Union  and  the European  Commission  acting  in  accordance  with  the provisions of Article 18 of the SRM Regulation).\n\nThe changes to the CRD / CRR regulations are accompanied by  a  new  European  prudential  framework  for  investment companies, commonly known as the IFD / IFR (\"Investment Firm  Directive  /  Regulation\"),  which  consists  of  the  IFD Directive  and  a  regulation  dated  27  November  2019, applicable from 26 June 2021. The IFD/IFR aims to establish a prudential  framework  that  is  more  in  line  with  the  size  and risks of investment companies, which are often different from traditional banking  risks.  The  capital  requirements  for investment  companies  therefore  now  include  business volumes  and  the  balance  sheet  risk  approach  has  been simplified. The consolidated CRD/CRR regulations still apply to  the  Group  due  to  the  presence  of  at  least  one  credit institution among its entities. However, Amundi Interm\u00e9diation and  Amundi  ESR  have  the  status  of investment company and are subject to this new scheme on an individual basis.\n\nIn  addition,  on  27  October  2021,  the  European  Commission introduced  a  legislative  package  to  finalise  the  adoption  of the  Basel  III  standards  within  the  European  Union  and announced that these new texts should come into force on 1 January 2025. This legislative package is composed of (i) a proposal  for  a  directive  to  amend  the  CRD  Directive,  (ii)  a proposal for a regulation to amend the CRR Regulation and (iii)  a  proposal for a regulation to amend the aspects of the CRR Regulation relating specifically to bank resolution. These texts  include  a  number  of  changes  to  the  existing  rules, including  (i)  the  implementation  of  the  latest  measures included in the Basel III standards, (ii) the inclusion of explicit rules  on  the  supervision  and  management  of  ESG  risks  and the introduction of additional powers for regulators in regard to the assessment of ESG risks, and (iii) greater alignment of the supervisory powers of regulators. On 8 November 2022, the  Council  presented  its  position  on  the  proposal  put forward by the European Commission and began discussions with the European Parliament in order to finalise the definite version of these texts.",

Accordingly, the European resolution authorities, including the Single Resolution Board, have  been  given  extensive  powers  to  take  all  necessary measures relating to the resolution of the entirety or part of a credit institution or the group to which it belongs.\n\nThe resolution  authorities  may  open  a  resolution  procedure against a credit institution if they consider that: the failure of the  institution  is  confirmed  or  likely,  there  is  no  reasonable prospect  that  another  non-public  measure  would  avert  the institution's failure within a reasonable timeframe, a resolution  measure  is  needed  and  a  winding-up  procedure would  not  accomplish  the  aims  of  the  resolution  described above.\n\nFollowing  the  opening  of  a  resolution  procedure,  the resolution  authorities  have  several  tools  that  they  may deploy with the aim of recapitalising the relevant institution or  restoring  its  viability,  under  the  conditions  described below.  They  may  implement  the  \"internal  bailout\"  tool  to reduce  the  nominal  value  of  capital  instruments  or  convert other  capital  instruments  and  some  of  the  institution's commitments into securities. The internal bailout tool is first implemented  by  reducing  the  nominal  value  of  category  1 capital  securities  and  then  by  converting  or  reducing  the nominal value of other capital instruments, followed by some of the institution's commitments.\n\nWe understand that for mutual banking groups, including the Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  group,  the  \"extended  SPE\"  resolution strategy should be preferred by the resolution authorities. As such,  and  if  the  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  group  were  to  be  declared bankrupt, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. (in its capacity as the central body) and the entities affiliated to it would be considered as\n\na  single  entry  point  (it  being  specified  that  Amundi  is  not affiliated with the central body Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A.).\n\nIn  the  event  of  financial  difficulties  that  may  justify  the initiation  of  a  resolution  procedure  against  the  Group,  or  if the  viability  of  the  Company  or  Group  depends  on  it,  the Company  shares  in  circulation  may  be  diluted  by  the conversion  of  other  capital  or  debt  instruments,  whether cancelled  or  transferred,  thus  depriving  shareholders  of their rights.\n\nIn  addition  to  the  internal  bailout  tool,  broader  powers  are conferred on the resolution authority in order to implement other resolution measures concerning defaulting institutions (or the group to which they belong), comprising in particular: the total or partial transfer of the activities of the institution to a third-party or relay institution, the separation of assets, the  replacement  or  substitution  of  the  establishment  as  a debtor in respect of debt instruments, changes to the terms and conditions of debt instruments (the maturity date and/or the  amount  of  interest  and/or  temporary  suspension  of payments),  the  removal  of  officers  from  their  duties,  the appointment of a special administrator and the issue of new capital  securities  or  other  capital  instruments.  When  it  uses its  powers,  the  resolution  authority  must  take  into  account the  situation  of  the  Group  or  institution  concerned  and  the potential consequences of its decisions in the Member State in question.\n\nAs  a  result,  although  it  cannot  be  predicted,  should  the Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  group  be  declared  bankrupt,  the  resolution authorities  could  require  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  S.A.  to  sell  all  the Company shares it holds.\n\n## MREL Ratio\n\nThe MREL ratio (Minimum Requirement for Own Funds and Eligible  Liabilities)  is  defined  in  the  BRRD  Directive  and  the SRM Regulation and defines a minimum requirement for own funds  and  eligible  liabilities  that  credit  institutions  must maintain and that must be available in order to absorb losses in  the  event  of  resolution.  The  aim  is  to  ensure  the effectiveness  of  the  internal  bail-in  mechanism  should  it become necessary and to allow credit institutions' own funds to  be  fully  reconstituted,  after  potential  adjustments  for, among other things, meeting resolution targets and securing access to the market.\n\nAmundi does not have its own MREL requirement, but as a subsidiary of the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. group, it contributes to the  ratio  calculated  at  consolidated  level  and  is  included  in the  monitoring  and  leadership  system  implemented  by  the Group.\n\n## The Single Resolution Fund\n\nIn  accordance with the SRM Regulation, a Single Resolution Fund  (SRF)  has  been  in  place  since  1  January  2016,  which may  be  used  by  the  Single  Resolution  Board  to  support resolution plans. On 19 December 2014, the Council adopted Implementing  Regulation  (EU)  2015/81  specifying  uniform conditions of application of the SRM Regulation with regard to ex ante contributions to the Single Resolution Fund. This Regulation defines the method for calculating the contributions  of  credit  institutions  to  the  Single  Resolution Fund,  and  sets  out  the  annual  contributions  to  be  paid  by credit institutions to the latter, in proportion to the amount of their  liabilities,  excluding  own  funds  and  deposits  covered and adjusted according to risks, with the aim of reaching at least 1% of the amount of deposits covered by all authorised credit institutions by 31 December 2023. As of July 2022, the Single Resolution Fund stood at approximately \u20ac66 billion.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

We are not  required  to  give  our  opinion  as  to  whether  they  are beneficial  or  appropriate  or  to  ascertain  the  existence  of other agreements. It is your responsibility, in accordance with Article  R.225-31  of  the  French  Commercial  Code (Code  de commerce) ,  to  assess  the  relevance  of  these  agreements prior to their approval.\n\nWe  are  also  required,  where  applicable,  to  inform  you  in accordance with Article R.225-31 of the French Commercial Code (Code  de  commerce) of  the  continuation  of  the implementation, during the year ended December 31,2023, of the agreements previously approved by the Annual General Meeting.\n\nWe  performed  those  procedures  which  we  deemed necessary  in  compliance  with  professional  guidance  issued by  the  French  Institute  of  Statutory  Auditors (Compagnie Nationale  des  commissaires  aux  comptes) relating  to  this type of engagement. These procedures consisted in verifying the  consistency  of  the  information  provided  to  us  with  the relevant source documents.\n\n## Agreements submitted for approval to the Annual General Shareholders' Meeting\n\n## Agreements authorised and concluded during the year ended Decembe 31, 2023\n\nIn accordance with Article L.225-40 of the French Commercial  Code (Code  de  commerce) , we  have  been notified  of  the  following  agreements  concluded  during  the year ended December 31, 2023 that have been authorized by your Board of Directors:\n\n## With the Company Cr\u00e9dit Agricole SA and the group Cr\u00e9dit Agricole: Set up of a VAT group:\n\n## Person concerned\n\n- \u00b7 Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A., Majority shareholder.\n- \u00b7 Mr. Philippe Brassac, President of your Company and Chief Executive Officer of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A.;\n- \u00b7 Mr. Christian  Rouchon, Administrator and Chief Executive Officer of Caisse R\u00e9gionale du Languedoc;\n- \u00b7 Mrs.  Christine  Gandon,  Administrator  and  President  of Caisse R\u00e9gionale du Nord-Est;\n- \u00b7 Mrs.  Mich\u00e8le  Guibert,  Administrator  and  Chief  Executive Officer of Caisse R\u00e9gionale des Cotes d'Armor;\n- \u00b7 Mr.  Michel  Mathieu,  Administrator  and  Chief  Executive Officer of LCL;\n- \u00b7 Mr  Patrice  Genti\u00e9,  Administrator  and  President  of  Caisse R\u00e9gionale d'Aquitaine.\n\n## Nature and purpose\n\nYour  Board  of  Directors  on  July  27,  2023  authorized  the agreement for Amundi to join Cr\u00e9dit Agricole VAT group for an initial period of 3 years (2023-2025) to which 296 Group entities  have  signed  up,  including  Amundi  and  some  of  its subsidiaries.\n\n## Terms and conditions\n\nThe purpose of this agreement is to establish a principle of fairness  between  the  members  of  the  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  VAT Group,  which  must  result  in  the  establishment  of  a compensation mechanism and, where appropriate, a sharing of residual VAT savings among the members.\n\nAmundi S.A. recorded an income of \u20ac55,741 as a share of net residual gain anticipated for the group VAT in 2023.\n\nThe income recorded by the entities of Amundi group, that have signed up to the VAT group, is a total of \u20ac6,810,069 in 2023.\n\n## Motivation\n\nMembership of the VAT group enables the Amundi division to sustain the VAT savings, which it has acquired, and which it  benefited  from  in  its  own  right  because  of  the  pool  of resources it had created (and which, compliant with the EU Law, can no longer be implemented since January 1 st ,  2023). Furthermore, the Board noted that, for each entity member of the VAT  group, the agreement neutralizes the consequences  induced  by  membership  of  the  VAT  group (gains or losses other than the positive impacts of Amundi's former independent VAT-group of persons) and, in addition, has  the  interest,  for  Amundi  Finance,  of  benefiting  from  a share of the residual net gain that could possibly be realized by the VAT group each year.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

The key characteristics of  high  quality  liquid  assets  are:  1)  low  risk  and  volatility, 2)  ease  and  certainty  of  valuation,  3)  low  correlation  with high-risk assets, and  4)  listing  on  a  developed  and recognised  market  of  significant  size.  The  part  of  the  high quality  liquid  assets  that  is  not  already  used  as  collateral  is used as the numerator of the short-term liquidity ratio (LCR Liquidity Coverage Ratio), according to the same regulations.\n\n## Account administration\n\nAccount  administration  or  account  keeping  consists  of entering financial instruments into an account in the name of their  holder,  i.e.  recognising  the  holder's  rights  over  those financial instruments, and keeping the corresponding assets, according  to  the  particular  arrangements  for  each  financial instrument.\n\n## CA and SG insurers\n\nEntities belonging to the insurance companies of the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole  and  Soci\u00e9t\u00e9  G\u00e9n\u00e9rale  groups  that  have  formed  an agreement  with  Amundi  for  the  management  of  their general assets.\n\n## Asset class\n\nAn asset class consists of  financial  assets  that  share  similar characteristics.  Amundi  has  identified  the  following  asset classes  for  the  monitoring  of  its  activities:  Treasury,  fixed income, multi-asset, equity, real and structured.\n\n## Net inflows/(outflows)\n\nOperating activities indicator not reflected in the consolidated  financial  statements  and  that  corresponds  to the  difference  between  the  subscription  and  buyback amounts  of  the  period.  Positive  net  inflows  mean  that  the total  amount  of  inflows  (from  client  investments)  is  higher than  the  amount  of  outflows  (from  client  withdrawals). Conversely, negative net inflows mean that the total amount of outflows is higher than the amount of inflows.\n\n## Net management fees\n\nNet management fees equal management fees received net of  fees  paid.  Management  fees  received  correspond  to management  fees  paid  by  the  portfolio,  which  remunerate the  asset  management  company  and  are  recognised  when the  service  is  rendered.  These  fees  are  generally  calculated by applying a percentage to the assets under management, as well as fees paid by the funds to Amundi Finance for the guarantee  it  provides  for  guaranteed  funds  or  EMTNs, transaction fees paid by the fund, and other fees for smaller amounts (entry fees, securities lending/borrowing fees, etc.). Fees  paid  comprise  commissions  paid  to  distributors  in accordance  with  contractual  provisions,  depositary  and valuation fees where paid by the management company, and to a lesser extent, certain related administrative costs.\n\n## Performance fees\n\nPerformance  fees  are  paid  to  the  asset  management company as provided by contract. They are calculated on the basis of a percentage of the positive difference between the observed performance of the fund and the benchmark index mentioned in the contract.\n\n## Upfront fees\n\nFees paid by the client that correspond to commissions paid to  distributors,  in  accordance  with  contractual  provisions. They are generally defined as a percentage of management fees.  These  upfront  fees  paid  to  distributors  are  fixed  and amortised over the life of the contracts.\n\n## Depositary\n\nService  provider  ensuring  the  safekeeping  of  securities  and checking the lawfulness of management decisions taken on behalf  of  the  UCITS-type  funds.  The  depositary  may contractually  outsource  part  of  its  functions  to  another establishment  authorised  to  provide  account-keeping  and custody services; in particular, it may outsource the custody of  assets  to  a  \"custodian\".  However,  it  may  not  outsource checks  on  the  lawfulness  of  decisions  taken  by  the management company of the UCITS-type funds.\n\n## Third-party distributors\n\nA  distributor  is  a  service  provider  in  charge  of  marketing investment  services  and  financial  instruments  to  its  client base (retail customers or institutional investors). Amundi has contracts  with  more  than  1,000  distributors  worldwide  for the  marketing  of  its  products  and  services.  The  scope  of Amundi's third-party distributors includes all these distributors  except  partner  distribution  networks  in  France, partner  distribution  networks  outside  France  and  joint ventures.",

        "page_content": "## Assets under management\n\nOperational  business  indicator  not  reflected  in  the  Group's unaudited  consolidated  financial  statements,  corresponding to  assets  in  portfolios  marketed  by  the  Group,  whether  the Group  manages  them,  advises  on  them  or  delegates  their management  to  an  external  investment  manager.  For  each fund, assets under management are measured by multiplying the  net  asset  value  per  unit  (calculated  by  an  external valuation  agent  in  accordance  with  regulations  in  force)  by the number of units/shares in issue.\n\n## ETF (Exchange Traded Fund)\n\nAn ETF (Exchange Traded Fund) or tracker is a listed index fund that aims to replicate the performance of its benchmark index as closely as possible, both upwards and downwards. An ETF security trades like a normal share and can therefore be purchased or sold during market trading hours.\n\n## Formula funds\n\nType of mutual funds whose aim is to achieve, after a defined period,  a  value  determined  by  the  strict  application  of  a predefined  calculation  formula,  based  on  financial  market indicators or financial instruments, and as the case may be to distribute  revenues,  which  are  determined  in  the  same manner.\n\n## FCP mutual fund\n\nType of UCITS that issues units and has no legal personality. The  investor,  by  buying  units,  becomes  a  joint  owner  of securities,  but  has  no  voting  rights.  The  investor  is  not  a shareholder in the fund. An FCP mutual fund is represented and  managed  in  administrative,  financial  and  accounting terms  by  a  single  management  company,  which  may outsource those tasks.\n\n## Alternative investment fund (AIF)\n\nAlternative  investment  funds  or  AIFs  are  investment  funds that  are  distinct  from  UCITS-type  funds.  They  raise  capital from a certain number of investors to invest, in the interests of  those  investors,  in  accordance  with  an  investment  policy defined by the AIFs or their management companies.\n\n## Fund of funds\n\nA fund of funds is an undertaking for collective investment in transferable securities (UCITS-type funds) that mainly invests in equities or units of other mutual funds.\n\nBy  convention,  assets  held  by  Amundi  funds  invested  in other  funds  are  counted  in  the  AuM  of  \"Institutional excluding CA and SG Insurers\".\n\n## Collective investment fund\n\nInvestment  funds  are  undertakings  that  collectively  own financial  assets.  In  France,  these  funds  take  various  legal forms that are often very specific. Most collective investments  are  regulated  by  the  AMF  (UCITS-type  funds, AIFs, \"other AIFs\" and \"other collective investments\").\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Multi-asset fund\n\nA diversified fund invests in a portfolio of a wide variety of securities  in  different  asset  classes  (equities,  bonds,  money market, etc.). Risks and returns associated with a multi-asset fund  may  vary  greatly  depending  on  its  management objectives and the composition of its assets.\n\n## Constant proportion portfolio insurance (\"CPPI\") fund\n\nA type of UCI managed using Constant Proportion Portfolio Insurance, a management technique that allows investors to capitalise on the potential of financial markets while offering capital protection or guarantees. It is based on differentiation between  two  types  of  assets  in  a  single  portfolio:  dynamic assets  intended  to  produce  the  returns  sought,  and  assets providing  the  guarantee  or  protection.  The  breakdown  of assets  between  these  two  types  is  reviewed  regularly  in order to achieve the management objective.\n\n## Open-ended fund\n\nCollective investment undertakings that may take the form of a UCITS-type fund, AIF or other, that are open to both nonprofessional and professional investors.\n\n## Sovereign fund\n\nInternational investment fund owned by a State or a State's central bank.\n\n## Structured fund\n\nType of investment fund that generally features guarantees or protection on some or all of the amounts invested, mainly comprising  two  large  families:  formula  funds  and  constant proportion portfolio insurance (CPPI) funds.\n\n## Alternative investment management\n\nInvestment  strategies  intended  to  achieve  returns  showing low correlation with market indices. Strategies cover various investment processes, risks and returns targets, and can be used  to  meet  a  wide  range  of  objectives.  Investors  access them  indirectly  (funds  of  hedge  funds)  or  directly  (hedge funds).\n\n## Asset management for third parties\n\nProcess  by  which  an  investor  (individual  or  institutional) delegates the financial management of its capital/savings to a financial intermediary, of which the management company is  the  most  common  institutional  form.  Asset  management for  third  parties  comprises  (i)  portfolio  management  or customised  mandate-based  management  for  individuals, companies  or  institutional  investors,  and  (ii)  collective management  through  collective  investment  undertakings (mutual funds).\n\n## Discretionary management\n\nInvestment service consisting of managing, on a discretionary  and  customised  basis,  portfolios  that  include one or more financial instruments as part of a mandate given by a third party.\n\n## Passive or index-based management\n\nInvestment  strategy  intended  to  replicate  as  accurately  as possible the performance of a benchmark index.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Institutional  clients  include  sovereign  funds, pension funds, insurers, other financial  institutions  and  nonprofit organisations. Amundi's \"Institutional Investors\" business  line  also  includes  Corporate  clients,  Employee Savings & Pensions and CA and SG insurers.\n\n## Seed (seed money investments)\n\nAmundi capital invested in order to launch funds before they are marketed. The intention is for this capital to be gradually replaced by capital invested by clients.\n\n## Managed account\n\nManaged accounts, which are covered by the AIFM Directive, are investment  funds  providing  access  to  alternative investment  management  in  a  regulated  environment,  while limiting  the  principal  operational  risks.  These  alternative funds are under the control and oversight of the operator of the managed account platform, who delegates the financial management  of  a  portfolio  to  a  third-party  investment manager. That manager has the task of replicating some or all of the investment strategy used in its reference fund. This operational arrangement is intended to limit exposure to the third-party  investment  manager  to  its  performance  drivers only.  The  aim  of  managed  accounts  is  to  offer  investors greater  levels  of  transaction  security,  independent  risk management  through  greater  transparency  and  generally improved liquidity.\n\n## Management mandates\n\nInvestment service consisting of managing, on a discretionary  and  customised  basis,  portfolios  that  include one or more financial instruments as part of a mandate given by a third party.\n\n## Net fee margin\n\nThe net fee margin is the ratio of net fees for a given period to  average  assets  under  management  (excluding  joint ventures) over the same period, expressed in basis points.\n\n## Structured bonds (or EMTNs)\n\nDebt security issued by financial institutions, with economic properties similar to those of a formula fund (as opposed to a simple  bond)  since  the  redemption  or  payment  of  interest depends on a mathematical formula that may include one or more  underlying  assets  of  a  variety  of  types  (equities, indices, funds, funds of funds, etc.).\n\n## OPCI (real-estate mutual fund)\n\nA real-estate mutual fund (OPCI) takes the form of either a variable-capital real-estate-focused investment company or a real-estate  investment  fund,  and  its  purpose  is  to  invest  in properties intended for rental or properties that it has built exclusively  in  order  to  rent  out,  which  it  owns  directly  or indirectly, including buildings not yet completed, as well as to carry  out  all  operations  involved  in  using  or  reselling  such properties,  all  types  of  works  on  these  properties  including operations  relating  to  their  construction,  renovation  and upgrading with a view to letting them out, and on an ancillary basis to manage financial instruments and deposits.\n\n## UCITS-type funds (undertakings for collective investments in transferable securities)\n\nPortfolio  of  transferable  securities  (shares,  bonds,  etc.) managed  by  professionals  (asset  management  company) and  held  collectively  by  individual  or  institutional  investors. There are two types of UCITS-type funds: SICAVs (variablecapital investment companies) and FCPs (mutual funds).\n\n## Voluntary investment\n\nProprietary investments carried out by Amundi, as opposed to investments for third parties.\n\n## Basis point (BP)\n\nA basis point is equal to 0.01% or 1/10,000.\n\n## Privileged\n\nNotion  qualifying  Amundi's  commercial  relationship  with certain distributors that provide  specific  services  and implement  particular  efforts  to  promote  its  products.  The agreements formalising these relationships do not, however, provide for any exclusivity.\n\n## Derivative\n\nFinancial  instruments  whose  value  varies  depending  on  the price  of  an  underlying  asset,  which  may  be  of  a  variety  of types  (equity,  index,  currency,  interest  rate,  etc.).  The derivative  gives  its  holder  exposure  to  fluctuations  in  the underlying without the holder having to buy or sell it itself. Derivative  contracts  can  take  a  variety  of  forms  (swaps, forwards, futures, options, CFDs, warrants, etc.).\n\n## Guaranteed product/fund\n\nDebt security or mutual fund where the achievement of the target  capital  repayment/return  is  guaranteed  by  a  credit institution.",

The Cr\u00e9dit Agricole group's raison d'\u00eatre (\"Acting in the interests of our clients and society every day\") is inconsistent with a statutory concept and was formulated in the context of the Group Project and the 2022 MTP.\n\n## Retail\n\nSegment  of  client  base  covering  the  following  distribution channels:  French  Networks,  International  Networks,  ThirdParty Distributors and joint ventures.\n\n## Smart beta\n\nInvestment  strategy  that  aims  to  build  asset  management processes based on alternative indices to those based on the weighting  of  securities by  market  capitalisation, e.g., TOBAM 's \"anti-benchmark \u00ae \" asset management.\n\n## Portfolio management company\n\nInvestment service provider whose main activity is managing assets  for  third  parties  (individually  through  a  management mandate  or  collectively  through  a  UCITS-type  fund)  and which is subject to AMF authorisation.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Spread\n\nSpread  generally  refers  to  the  difference  between  two interest rates. The term's precise definition varies according to the type of market in relation to which it is used.\n\n## Tracking error or replication error\n\nA tracking error or replication error is a measure of risk used in  asset  management in index-linked portfolios or portfolios compared to a benchmark index. It is the annualised standard deviation  of  the  differences  between  portfolio  yields  and benchmark index yield.\n\nA low tracking error indicates a fund whose behavior is close to that of the market.\n\n## Value at risk (VaR)\n\nValue at risk is an investor's maximum potential loss on the value  of  an  asset  or  portfolio  of  financial  assets,  which  is expected to occur only with a given probability over a given time  horizon.  In  other  words,  it  is  the  worst  loss  expected over  a  given  timeframe  for  a  certain  confidence  level.  VaR can  be  regarded  as  a  quantile  of  the  distribution  of  profits and  losses  associated  with  holding  an  asset  or  portfolio  of assets over a given period.\n\n<!-- image -->",
