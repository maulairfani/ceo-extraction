This report is intended to provide qualified insight into the BMW Group and explain our activities in a transparent, comprehensible and measurable manner. We are keen to demonstrate to our stakeholders how economic, ecological and social issues complement one another and are mutually dependent, and to identify the general external conditions that influence the Company. For these reasons, we explain \u2197 the BMW Group's strategy as well as the latest developments and the way in which the business is managed on the basis of key financial and non-financial indicators and targets. \u2197 Dashboard\n\nOn 12 March 2024, the Financial Statements of BMW AG were authorised for issue by the Board of Management and the Group Financial Statements approved for publication. The BMW Group Report  (hereinafter  also  'the  Report')  combines  the  management reports  of  Bayerische  Motoren  Werke  Aktiengesellschaft (BMW AG)  and  the  BMW Group  in  a  Combined  Management Report.\n\nThe report is divided into the following sections:\n\n- 1 - To Our Stakeholders\n- 2 - Combined Management Report\n- 3 - Group Financial Statements\n- 4 - Responsibility Statement and Auditor's Report\n- 5 - Remuneration Report\n- 6 - Other Information\n\n## Reporting Outlook for 2024\n\nNon-financial disclosure requirements are continuing to evolve. From the 2024 reporting year onwards, the BMW Group will be subject to the transparency requirements of the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) and the European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS). We are currently implementing  the  new  sustainability  reporting  standards  and  assessing their impact on the structure and scope of the BMW Group's reporting with a particular focus on the management report.

The \u2197 GRI Index is also available on the website as a separate document. The reporting period  covers  the  financial  year  from1 January  to 31  December 2023. The statements made in the report generally relate to the BMW Group reporting entity. Any deviations are marked accordingly. The BMW Group Report 2024 will be published in March 2025.\n\n## \u2197 GRI Index: 2-2, 2-3, 2-4\n\n## External audit\n\nThe report, comprising the Combined Management Report, the Group Financial Statements and the additional GRI information, has been subject to an annual independent audit by PricewaterhouseCoopers GmbH Wirtschaftspr\u00fcfungsgesellschaft ('PwC' or 'Auditor'). Unaudited sections are marked accordingly. The external audit serves to underpin the reliability and trustworthiness of the information contained therein for the public. The external audit supports the Supervisory Board of BMW AG in fulfilling its auditing  duties.  Any  links  and  disclosures  that  refer  to  information outside the BMW Group Report and the GRI Index are not part of the audit. The \u2197 Remuneration Report 2023 was prepared in  accordance  with  the  requirements  of  \u00a7 162  of  the  German Stock Corporation Act (AktG) and its content audited by PwC.\n\nPwC has audited the Group Financial Statements and the Combined Management Report for the 2023 reporting year and issued an unqualified audit opinion thereupon. Further i nformation is provided in the \u2197 Independent Auditor's Report and the \u2197 Independent Practitioner's Report on Non-financial Disclosures.\n\nThe contents  of  the  NFS,  in  accordance  with  \u00a7 289 b  ff.  and \u00a7 315 b  ff.  HGB,  were  subjected  to  an  audit  to  obtain  limited\n\nFurthermore, the Combined Management Report makes reference  to  the  following  reporting  standards  and  transparency requirements:\n\n- -GRI Standards 2021 of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) (\u2197 GRI Index )\n- -SASB Standards according to the Sustainable Accounting Standards Board (\u2197 SASB Index )\n- -Recommendations  of  the  Task  Force  on  Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) (\u2197 TCFD Index )\n\n## Group Financial Statements\n\nThe Group Financial Statements of Bayerische Motoren Werke Aktiengesellschaft for the year ended 31 December 2023 have been  prepared  in  accordance  with  International  Financial  Reporting Standards (IFRS) as endorsed by the European Union (EU) and the supplementary requirements of \u00a7 315 e HGB.\n\nassurance and are denoted with the symbol [[ ]] . The section \u2197 Dialogue with Stakeholders and the additional information provided in the section \u2197 Further GRI Information were also subjected to a limited assurance engagement. Information provided in the \u2197 SASB Index is also subjected to a limited assurance review on a voluntary basis. The \u2197 TCFD Index indicates the sections in which the depth  of  the  audit  is  identified.  Certain  individual  parts  of  the \u2197 NFS as  well  as the remainder of the Combined Management Report were also subjected to a reasonable assurance engagement.\n\n## Materiality analysis\n\nThe material topics covered in our non-financial reporting for the reporting year are derived from the materiality analysis which the BMW Group performed in 2022 in accordance with \u00a7 289 c and \u00a7 315 c HGB and validated for the 2023 reporting year.  The topics that were categorised as material remain those where the actions of the BMW Group may have a significant sustainability impact on the environment and society (inside-out) and which may be of high business relevance to the BMW  Group (outside-in). As a result, our focus is on alternative drive systems \u2197 Electromobility , decarbonisation along the value chain \u2197 Carbon emissions , responsible sourcing \u2197 Purchasing and Supplier Network , resource management in line with the principle of the circular economy \u2197 Circular Economy, Resource Efficiency and Renewable Energy as  well  as  compliance \u2197 Compliance and Human Rights . Employee diversity and equal opportunity \u2197 Diversity, Equal Opportunity and Inclusion as well as an attractive workplace \u2197 Employer Attractiveness and Employee Development are also given high priority within the BMW Group. Our reporting under the GRI standards also covers topics which are considered material  from  a  double  materiality  perspective  because  they have  a  significant  environmental  impact  (inside-out)  or  are  of high  business  relevance  to  the  BMW Group  (outside-in).  This concept must be applied from 2024 onwards in accordance with the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive. The topics covered  in  this  context  are  responsible  digitalisation \u2197 Innovation, Digitalisation and Customer Orientation , Product and Road Safety \u2197 Product Quality and Safety , Occupational Health and Safety \u2197 Health and Performance and Sustainable Governance \u2197 Performance Management .",

        "page_content": "## Connection to figures in the Group Financial Statements\n\nFor each topic, an assessment was carried out to identify figures reported in the Group financial statements that enable a better understanding of the NFS, and which therefore need to be disclosed and explained.\n\n## Sustainable Development Goals\n\nWith its business operations, the BMW Group is in a position to contribute directly to the achievement of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), in particular SDG 3, 8, 9, 12 and 13. Information about the importance of these goals for the BMW Group is provided on our \u2197 website .\n\n## Forward-looking statements\n\nThis  report  contains  various  forward-looking  statements  concerning future developments that are based on the current status of the BMW Group's assumptions and forecasts. These statements are therefore subject to a variet y of predictable and unpredictable risks, uncertainties and other factors, which means that the actual outcome, including that of the BMW Group's net assets, financial position and results of operations, its development or performance, could differ conside rably from those statements.\n\n## Preparation of non-financial performance figures\n\nCertain non-financial performance figures reported by BMW Group are based on a significant number of estimates and valuations. Some are complex and subjective in nature, or subject to uncertainty for other reasons. The BMW  Group is also continuously updating the policies and procedures used to calculate its non-financial performance figures. It is not always practical to apply new policies and procedures to prior reporting periods. Although the methodology used to calculate indicators is in line with standard practice, some indicators are not directly comparable with the values reported by other companies.\n\nThe BMW Group is also required to ensure that third parties report relevant data to the BMW Group correctly. These third parties include independent dealerships - the overwhelming majority of which report vehicle delivery figures to the BMW Group and suppliers, which provide the BMW Group with data on the implementation of agreed measures designed to reduce carbon emissions.\n\n## Statement on Corporate Governance\n\nThe Board of Management and the Supervisory Board of BMW AG prepare a yearly combined Statement on Corporate Governance in accordance with \u00a7 289 f and \u00a7 315 d HGB to report on corporate governance within the BMW Group. The Statement on Corporate  Governance  is  published  on  BMW AG's  website  at \u2197 www.bmwgroup.com/ezu . It also includes the Declaration of Compliance pursuant to \u00a7 161 AktG.\n\n## Editorial comments\n\nKey figures presented in the report have been rounded in accordance with standard commercial practice. In individual cases, this may mean that figures do not add up exactly to the stated total and that percentages cannot be derived from the values shown.\n\nthe Summarised disclosures of fuel consumption, carbon emissions and electricity consumption are provided in the \u2197 Consumption and Carbon Disclosures .\n\nsection\n\n<!-- image -->",

In 2020, a phase-in regulation was accepted, as was the recognition of supercredits, which ceased in 2021.\n- 9 Efficiency ratio calculated on the basis of Scope 1 and Scope 2 carbon emissions (i.e. a market-based method according to GHG Protocol Scope 2 guidance; mainly based on the use of emissions factors for electricity, district heating and fuels of the VDA (each in the most current valid version: 12/2023) and occasionally using local emissions factors; excluding climate-changing gases other than carbon dioxide from vehicle production (BMW Group manufacturing sites and Motorrad, but excluding partner plants and contract manufacturers), as well as BMW Group non-manufacturing sites (e.g. research centres, sales centres, office buildings) divided by the number of vehicles produced (BMW Group manufacturing sites and partner plants, but excluding contract manufacturers).\n- 10 The term 'RoCE' has been redefined with effect from the reporting year 2022 (for definition, see \u2197 Glossary).

This is impressively demonstrated by the fact that all-electric automobiles now make up nearly 15% of total sales. The record high achieved in 2023 for total deliveries across all drivetrain types, and the leading position of the BMW brand in the global premium segment further demonstrate that the BMW Group's flexible drivetrain strategy is the right approach. Rigorous, farsighted decision-making have made this overall corporate success possible, ensureing that the Group remains resilient, especially in volatile times.\n\nWe also achieved a great deal in terms of sustainability in 2023, as our vehicle fleet once again attained figures well within the EU's target limit for fleet carbon emissions.\n\n2024 promises to be an exciting year for the BMW Group with a record number of product launches. We firmly believe that, thanks to the enthusiasm and precision of our strong workforce, we will master the challenges ahead and continue to set ourselves apart from the competition with our wide range of products across all brands and drivetrain types. The enthusiastic response to the presentation of the BMW VISION Neue Klasse at IAA Mobility in Munich clearly demonstrates that the BMW Group is on the right path.\n\nNorbert Reithofer Chairman of the Supervisory Board\n\n<!-- image -->",

We focused in particular on driving forward the Group's electrification strategy and expanding it to include all segments and markets, as well as on implementing the corporate strategies adopted in the fields of digitalisation and sustainability. At each of the five plenary sessions of the Supervisory Board (including one two-day meeting), we held detailed discussions with the Board of Management regarding the Group's position. The Board of Management also kept the Supervisory Board well informed regarding any matters of significance outside the framework of formal meetings. Furthermore, I discussed matters personally and on a regular basis with the Chairman of the Board of Management. In addition, the Chairman of the Audit Committee maintained a direct line of contact with the Board of Management member responsible for Finance as well as with the external auditor's representatives outside of meetings. We regularly dealt with internal Supervisory Board issues and personnel-related matters without the presence of the Board of Management. Our cooperation, both within the Supervisory Board and its committees and with the Board of Management, was conducted in a spirit of trust, respect and constructiveness. Detailed documents on the main topics of each meeting were distributed to the members in advance. Moreover, the shareholder and employee representatives regularly prepared for the meetings in separate preliminary discussions.\n\nIn its reports on the BMW Group's position , the Board of Management kept us well informed at each meeting regarding current developments and the Group's overall performance. A regular topic of discussion at Supervisory Board meetings was the development of current sales trends based on figures analysed by brand, segment and market region, for both the BMW Group and its competitors. There was also a keen focus on electrified vehicles and an overview of the Group's key financial indicators and liquidity situation.\n\nCorporate strategy , including sustainability, remained high on the Supervisory Board's agenda. Following an analysis of the current situation in the automotive industry and the ramifications of geopolitical developments, the Board of Management presented us with a detailed strategy for implementing the automotive transformation. The strategy covered the topics of electrification, digitalisation and sustainability, highlighting in particular the circular economy concept as a key element of the Group's sustainable corporate approach. The BMW Group's ambitious decarbonisation targets for2030 were also reaffirmed. With regard to digitalisation, the Board of Management has placed the NEUE KLASSE at the centre of its strategy, making it the benchmark for a holistic customer experience. The Board of Management also described the digitalisation of key business processes to the Supervisory\n\nBoard. Further topics covered by the Board of Management's extensive report were market strategies focusing particularly on China and Europe, the resilience of supply chains, and the holistic, Group-wide performance programme. The report was rounded off with an analysis of the competition and the outlook for the BMW Group's product portfolio.\n\nAt each meeting, the Board of Management updated us on current issues and projects related to strategy development work and implementation. The Board of Management also reported on recent events such as the Group's successful appearance at the IAA Mobility in Munich, the world premiere of the all-electric BMW iX2 and the BMW iX5 Hydrogen at the Japan Mobility Show, and the implementation of the major internal training programme 'Digital Boost'.\n\nThe Supervisory Board also closely monitored developments relating to major strategic collaborations . In 2023, the focus was once again on the Chinese market in particular, with respect to both the BMW Brilliance Automotive joint venture and the cooperation with Great Wall Motors for the local production of an all-electric MINI. We were also informed about the status of the investments in YOUR NOW.\n\nAt Supervisory Board meetings we regularly addressed the topics of sustainability and ESG . In a report on recent developments within the Group, the Board of Management informed us about the cooperation with IONITY on rapid charging networks, the conversion of BMW Group plants in Oxford and Swindon to enable the manufacturing of all-electric MINI vehicles, and the successful outcome of the local referendum held in Irlbach-Stra\u00dfkirchen on the proposed construction of a new BMW Group plant to manufacture high-voltage batteries, among other things. Furthermore, we were very pleased to note that the BMW Group was presented with awards for activities relating to its sustainability strategy, conferred by a management consultancy and the magazine 'Automobilwoche', which voted the Group number one in the automobile manufacturer category. Moreover, the Fair Pay Innovation Lab awarded the BMW Group a gold medal in the category 'Fair Pay Leader'.\n\nWithin the framework of a presentation on the perception of the sustainability of the BMW Group and its brands, we examined the objectives of the Group's corporate ESG strategy in greater detail and looked at corporate communication regarding sustainability issues as well as their media coverage. Regarding the energy transformation within the BMW Group as well as decarbonisation at Group sites, we were informed in particular about the further improvement of energy management and the strategy involving the transition to renewable energy sources at the BMW Group's existing production sites by 2030. We were also provided with reports on plans for new structures where no fossil fuels will be used (such as the plant in Debrecen, where production is scheduled to begin in 2025).\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "Report of the Supervisory Board\n\nIn the course of our work on corporate governance , we further developed and updated parts of the Supervisory Board's skills matrix, which was introduced in 2022. Based on a self-assessment, we concluded that the composition of the Supervisory Board at 31 December 2023 fully meets the targets stipulated in the diversity concept and the competency profile.\n\nIn the Declaration of Compliance with the German Corporate Governance Code issued in December 2023, the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board confirmed that they have complied with the recommendations of the Code as amended on 28 April 2022 without exception and will continue to fully comply with them in future.\n\nWe also dealt with the Group's compliance management system in great depth. In his annual report, the Chief Compliance Officer presented changes to the structure and content of the BMW Group's compliance management system and the revision of compliance regulations. The report also addressed the implementation of the German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act and the handling of individual cases. Moreover, at the Compliance Days in Munich, the Chief Compliance Officer relayed a message from the Chairman of the Board of Management that set the 'tone from the top', and addressed operational prevention measures.\n\nAt each meeting, the Board of Management informed us about the current status of important legal framework conditions and regulatory projects. These included in particular the EU's regulations regarding fleet carbon emissions in conjunction with the EU's 'Fit for 55' package and the Euro 7 emissions standards.\n\nThe Supervisory Board examined the Board of Management's remuneration in great detail. It reviewed the target structure, maximum remuneration and expected remuneration for the Board of Management for the financial year 2023, considering in particular the Group's performance and the development of remuneration for senior executives and employees in Germany over the past few years. Based on a comparative study conducted by an external independent remuneration consultant and subsequent oral advice, we concluded that the remuneration paid to Board of Management members for the financial year 2022 and the target remuneration for 2023 were appropriate. Detailed information on the Board of Management's remuneration for the financial year 2023 is provided in the Remuneration Report. In December 2023, following thorough preparation by the Personnel Committee, we adopted the variable remuneration targets applicable to Board of Management members for the financial year 2024, taking into account the budget for 2024, the long-term business plan and the BMW Group's corporate strategy, including its ESG goals.\n\nThe Board of Management updated the members of the Supervisory Board biannually on the current status of the level of attainment of defined financial KPIs and the KPIs for our ESG targets, such as deliveries of all-electric automobiles, fleet carbon emissions, attractiveness as an employer, and diversity.\n\n## In addition, key topics from the Board of Management's individual areas of\n\nresponsibility were on our agenda . Markets in the USA, Canada and Mexico as well as the 'fourth pillar' markets, in particular India, South Korea and Japan, were the subject of an indepth sales report. We discussed regional resilience and the growth strategy for these markets in great depth.\n\nIn the highly detailed risk report, we were brought up to date with the structure and working methods of the risk management system. A key focus of the report was on geopolitical risks, especially in the areas of purchasing/supply chains and sales markets as well as the presentation of measures to mitigate risk. On the subject of information security with a focus on IT security, we were informed about the organisation and functioning of the information security management system and the structure of the IT security risk model, as well as the measures derived from it and their effectiveness. The Board of Management also reported on the business performance, sector-specific risk profile and current projects of the Financial Services segment. In addition, we received a report on key topics relating to the Group's treasury system, such as funding, liquidity management, hedging strategies for price and currency risks and the current state of share buyback programmes.\n\nIn conjunction with the report on HR-related strategies, we looked at the BMW Group's attractiveness as an employer, employee performance and commitment, and workforce availability. The Board of Management also brought us up to date on the status of the Group's diversity concepts and the extent to which targets have been achieved regarding the proportion of women employed at various levels.\n\nIn December 2022, the Supervisory Board agreed to the plan to hold the Annual General Meeting 2023 on a virtual basis in accordance with the regulations applicable at the time. In March 2023, the detailed concept proposed by the Board of Management was approved. With regard to the Annual General Meeting 2024, the Board of Management explained the reasons for its decision in favour of the virtual format to the Supervisory Board.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "Report of the Supervisory Board\n\nThe BMW Group's long-term business plan was the subject of comprehensive examination by the Supervisory Board. In view of the ramp-up of electric mobility in an environment that remains challenging and volatile, the focus was on safeguarding growth and returns. The Board of Management informed us about plans for the various vehicle and corporate segments and ambitious long-term targets, while confirming its key objectives for growth, market shares and profitability. We were presented with key financial indicators for each segment, in addition to opportunities and risks for the planning period. After thorough examination, the Supervisory Board approved the long-term business plan drawn up by the Board of Management.\n\nIn December 2023, the Board of Management presented the budget for the financial year 2024. After exhaustive discussion with the Board of Management, we gave the budget our approval.\n\nI also met with investor representatives on a regular basis to discuss topics specific to the Supervisory Board during the financial year 2023. We touched on corporate governance issues such as succession planning for the Supervisory Board, the system for the Board of Management's remuneration and the future format of the Annual General Meeting as well as committee work and the Supervisory Board's handling of geopolitical risks.\n\nWith the BMW Group's support, Supervisory Board members attended advanced training courses on various topics during 2023. At our July meeting held at the BMW Group's Leipzig plant, the subject of which was 'BMW Group Production - Electrified. Digital. Sustainable', we discussed the topic of sustainability in production and energy generation at BMW Group sites. In September, we took a first in-depth look at the Group's technology, architecture and product strategy for the period as of 2025, and more closely at the strategic modules of the NEUE KLASSE. The members of the Supervisory Board then tested new BMW, MINI and Rolls-Royce models at the BMW M Driving Academy in Maisach. This involved a drive on the A8 motorway in the new BMW 5 Series sedan, where we tried out the level 2+ Highway Assistant. In addition, we were presented with BMW brand design vehicles, supplemented by a preview of the NEUE KLASSE. A talk by a renowned Chinese economics expert on the state of the Chinese economy in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic and on opportunities for multinational corporations provided some interesting insights into the Chinese market. The Supervisory Board held two hybrid meetings in October and November at which the heads of the responsible internal departments and an external consultant provided us with a comprehensive update on non-financial reporting and the EU taxonomy, focusing on implementation by the BMW Group. We also delved more deeply into the complex processes involved in implementing and reviewing the ambitious decarbonisation targets within the supply chain as well as the main levers for decarbonisation in this area.\n\nThe onboarding programme for new Supervisory Board members was also continued in 2023. As part of the programme, new members are given an insight into the BMW Group's key business areas and planning processes by representatives of internal specialist departments. The programme also includes an introduction to the ongoing work of the Supervisory Board.\n\nIn late 2023, we reviewed the effectiveness of the work of the Supervisory Board and its committees with the aid of a questionnaire, and discussed the findings in our subsequent meeting. Cooperation both within the Supervisory Board and with the Board of Management was unanimously perceived as constructive and trustworthy. In the current financial year, we intend to act on proposals to explore certain topics in greater depth, such as battery technology and the circular economy concept.\n\nThe Supervisory Board is careful to avoid any conflicts of interest in the course of its deliberations and decision-making processes. No conflicts of interest occurred in the financial year 2023.\n\n## Description of Presiding Board activities and committee work\n\nThe Supervisory Board has established a Presiding Board and four committees. At each subsequent Supervisory Board meeting, the Chairman of the Audit Committee, Dr Bock, and myself reported in detail on the work of the Presiding Committee and the other committees. Further information on the duties, composition and working methods of the Presiding Board as well as the various other committees is provided in the Statement of Corporate Governance on the BMW Group website.\n\nUnless a particular committee was responsible, the Presiding Board prepared the topics for the plenary meetings at its four meetings in cooperation with the Board of Management and senior heads of department. It also put forward proposals for reporting within the Supervisory Board. The Presiding Board focused especially on the corporate strategy and its sustainability-related aspects, in addition to longer-term corporate planning. The report on the BMW Group's position was discussed in detail at every meeting of the Presiding Board.\n\nThe Audit Committee convened eight times in total.\n\nIn March 2023, the focus was on preparing for the Supervisory Board meeting at which the financial statements for the financial year 2022 were discussed and examined. After verifying the matter of independence, the Audit Committee recommended to the Supervisory Board that PricewaterhouseCoopers GmbH Wirtschaftspr\u00fcfungsgesellschaft ('PwC') be elected auditor at the Annual General Meeting 2023. There were no indications of conflicts of interest, grounds for exclusion or lack of independence on the part of the auditor.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "Report of the Supervisory Board\n\nThe Audit Committee concluded that PwC's fee proposal for the audit of the Company and Group Financial Statements and the BMW Group Report 2023, as well as for the review of the Half-Year Report 2023, was appropriate in light of the scope of its tasks. The Committee therefore issued the corresponding contracts to PwC following its election at the Annual General Meeting in May 2023.\n\nThe Audit Committee also specified supplementary audit focus areas. Moreover, it approved the scope of the non-audit services to be performed, and received regular reports from PwC regarding these services. At its meetings, the Audit Committee discussed the quality of the audit in depth on several occasions. In particular, it received a report from the relevant department on the Group's experience with the audit of the financial statements for the financial year 2022 and on the results of the survey conducted within the Group for this purpose. Based on this report, the auditor's description of the quality assurance measures undertaken, and the Audit Committee's own experience with the auditor, the audit was found be of good quality.\n\nThe Audit Committee also examined the combined Non-financial Statement of BMW AG and the BMW Group for the financial year 2022, which was part of the BMW Group Report 2022. The Audit Committee had representatives from PwC explain the results of their audit. We have again engaged PwC to conduct a 'limited assurance' audit of the Non-financial (Group) Statement for the financial year 2023, to the extent that it relates to parts of the management report that are not subject to a 'reasonable assurance' audit. Going beyond the formal review required by law, the Audit Committee also engaged PwC to audit the contents of the Remuneration Report for the financial year 2023.\n\nThe Quarterly Statements were presented to us for discussion by the Audit Committee prior to their publication by the Board of Management. Representatives of the external auditors were also present when the Half-Year Financial Report was discussed in early August 2023.\n\nThe Board of Management informed the Audit Committee regarding the implementation of the first share buyback programme (which the Audit Committee had already approved in 2022), the redemption of the shares on 18 July 2023 and related reduction in share capital, as well as the second share buyback programme resolved by the Board of Management in May 2023.\n\nAt its meeting in July 2023, the Audit Committee considered the effectiveness and appropriateness of the BMW Group's internal control system (including the Corporate Audit function), the compliance management system and the risk management system. In the halfyearly risk reports, we addressed the principal risks facing the BMW Group and their classification. We focused particularly on geopolitical risks and the resulting risk scenarios, especially for supply chains and sales markets, as well as measures to mitigate these risks.\n\nWe also addressed the topic of climate-related risks. We regularly monitor the further development of the internal control system for non-financial reporting with regard to the Group's sustainability-related targets.\n\nThe head of Corporate Audit presented us with the key audit findings and plans for further internal audits. The Chief Compliance Officer of the BMW Group reported on the structural development of the compliance management system, the implementation of operational measures and further planning. The report also addressed the implementation of the German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act. In addition, we received a report on the BMW Group's tax and customs control system from the responsible head of department.\n\nIn its report on the audit of over-the-counter derivatives entered into by BMW AG during the financial year 2022, the external auditor confirmed to the Audit Committee the effectiveness of the system in place at BMW AG in complying with the regulatory requirements of the European Market Infrastructure Regulation.\n\nThe Audit Committee received regular reports on the state and development of significant legal proceedings and internal investigations and, in individual cases, discussed productand emissions-related proceedings with external legal advisors brought in for that purpose.\n\nIn its role as a preparatory body, in the course of 2023 the Personnel Committee convened four times to deliberate on the remuneration of, and succession planning for, the Board of Management. The review of the appropriateness of the Board of Management's remuneration for the financial years 2022 and 2023 and the determination of the factors for the Board of Management's variable remuneration for those years were the subjects of thorough preparation within the Personnel Committee. The determination of financial and ESG targets for the Board of Management's remuneration for the financial year 2024 was also discussed in great detail. In addition, the Personnel Committee prepared for the change of remuneration consultant in the financial year 2023. The renewal of the anticipatory resolution on the approval of loans and transactions by BMW Bank GmbH was also on the agenda.\n\nThe Nomination Committee held one meeting in the financial year 2023 in which it discussed the composition of shareholder representatives on the Supervisory Board. Taking into account the composition requirements resolved by the Supervisory Board and the recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code, the Nomination Committee issued recommendations for the Supervisory Board's election proposals to the Annual General Meeting to be held in 2024.\n\nThe Mediation Committee , which is prescribed by law, did not need to convene during the financial year under report.\n\n<!-- image -->",

As the Board of Management member responsible for Finance, he played a key role in shaping the development of the BMW Group with his profound expertise, entrepreneurial flair and vision. His work served to further cement the Group's excellent reputation, both on the capital market and in the public eye. We are greatly indebted to Nicolas Peter for his outstanding contribution.\n\nOn 12 May 2023, Walter Mertl was appointed as member of the Board of Management responsible for Finance. He joined the BMW Group in 1998 and was most recently responsible for corporate controlling. Mr Mertl has embodied the Group's commitment to sustainable profitability during the transformation for many years.\n\nOn 31 October 2023, Pieter Nota left the Board of Management by mutual agreement, also in line with the BMW Group's succession plans. After becoming the member of the Board of Management responsible for Customer, Brands and Sales in 2018, Mr Nota was a key figure in driving forward the sale of all-electric models and the digitalisation of the customer interface. He was also responsible for introducing a pioneering agency model for direct sales in selected markets. We wish to thank Pieter Nota for his excellent work and valuable inspiration.\n\nOn 1 November 2023, Jochen Goller was appointed as member of the Board of Management responsible for Customer, Brands and Sales. Mr Goller has been at the BMW Group since 1999 and has headed up activities in the China region since 2018. In Jochen Goller, we have appointed an internationally experienced sales manager with particular expertise in the Chinese market to the Board of Management.\n\n## Composition of the Supervisory Board, the Presiding Board and the Supervisory Board's committees\n\nThere were no changes to the composition of the Supervisory Board during the past year on the shareholder representative side. The Annual General Meeting elected Dr Kurt Bock to the Supervisory Board for a further term of office of approximately four years. He was subsequently appointed as Deputy Chairman of the Supervisory Board, member of the Presiding Board and of the Personnel Committee as well as member and Chairman of the Audit Committee.\n\nWith regard to the employee representatives, in January 2023 Dr Martin Kimmich was appointed to succeed the departing long-serving First Deputy Chairman of the Supervisory Board, Manfred Schoch, for his remaining term of office. Dr Kimmich has been Chairman of the Munich Works Council and the BMW AG Works Council since 2022.\n\n## Disclosure of attendance at meetings by individual members\n\nThe attendance rate at Supervisory Board meetings was 99%, and 100% for the meetings held by the various committees and the Presiding Board. The meetings were held in person, with individual members participating virtually only in justified exceptional cases. Three meetings of the Audit Committee that dealt with the quarterly reports were held as hybrid meetings, with individual members connected by either telephone or video call as planned.

        "page_content": "Report of the Supervisory Board\n\n## Review of financial statements and the profit distribution proposal\n\nPwC was appointed external auditor for the financial year 2023. PwC initially conducted a review of the condensed Interim Group Financial Statements and the Interim Group Management Report for the first half of 2023 and presented its findings to the Audit Committee. No issues were identified that might indicate that the condensed Interim Group Financial Statements and Interim Group Management Report had not been prepared in accordance with the applicable provisions in all material respects.\n\nThe Company Financial Statements and the Group Financial Statements of BMW AG for the financial year ended 31 December 2023, including the Combined Management Report, on which PwC has issued unqualified audit opinions, were authorised by the Board of Management on 12 March 2024. These audit opinions were signed for the fifth consecutive financial year by independent auditor Petra Justenhoven (Wirtschaftspr\u00fcferin) and, for the second time, by Michael Popp (Wirtschaftspr\u00fcfer) as the auditor responsible for the performance of the engagement.\n\nAt its meeting held on 29 February 2024, the Audit Committee initially gave in-depth consideration to the preliminary version of the Company and Group Financial Statements and the Combined Management Report (including the combined Non-financial (Group) Statement and the information on the EU taxonomy) as well as the draft version of the auditor's long-form reports.\n\nImmediately after authorising their issue, the Board of Management submitted the Company and Group Financial Statements for the financial year 2023 and the Combined Management Report (including the Combined Non-financial (Group) Statement) to the Supervisory Board. The auditor's long-form audit reports were also submitted to the Supervisory Board in a prompt manner. In order to facilitate preparations, drafts of these documents had already been made available to the Supervisory Board in advance.\n\nAt its meeting held on 13 March 2024, the Audit Committee diligently examined and deliberated on these documents before they were considered in detail at the plenary session of the Supervisory Board on 14 March 2024.\n\nAt the two respective meetings, the Board of Management provided a detailed explanation of the reporting documents submitted to the Audit Committee and the Supervisory Board. The representatives of the external auditor reported on the main findings of their audit and answered questions put to them by members of the Audit Committee and the Supervisory Board, partially without the presence of the members of the Board of Management. Both the Audit Committee and the Supervisory Board gave meticulous consideration to the key audit matters and the related audit procedures.\n\nThe representatives of the external auditors confirmed that the risk management system established by the Board of Management is capable of identifying at an early stage any developments that might threaten the Company's going-concern status. They also confirmed that no material weaknesses in the internal control system and risk management system were identified with regard to the financial reporting process.\n\nIn the course of their audit work, they did not identify any facts inconsistent with the contents of the Declaration of Compliance pursuant to \u00a7 161 of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG) jointly issued by the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board.\n\nBased on a thorough examination conducted by the Audit Committee and the Supervisory Board, we concurred with the results of the external audit. In accordance with the final result of this examination, no objections were raised. At our meeting held on 14 March 2024, we accordingly approved the Group and Company Financial Statements of BMW AG for the financial year 2023. The Company Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2023 have therefore been adopted.\n\nFurthermore, in both the Audit Committee and the full Supervisory Board, we examined the Board of Management's proposal to use the unappropriated profit to pay a dividend of \u20ac 6.00 for each share of common stock entitled to receive a dividend and \u20ac 6.02 for each share of preferred stock entitled to receive a dividend and to transfer the remaining amount to other revenue reserves. We consider the proposal appropriate and have therefore approved it.\n\nBased on the preparatory work of the Audit Committee, the Supervisory Board and the Board of Management jointly prepared the Remuneration Report for the financial year 2023 in accordance with \u00a7 162 AktG. At the request of the Audit Committee, PwC reviewed the contents of the Remuneration Report, reported to both the Audit Committee and the Supervisory Board on the results of the review, and confirmed that the Remuneration Report complies with the financial reporting provisions contained in \u00a7 162 AktG in all material respects.\n\nThe Audit Committee and the Supervisory Board also carefully examined the combined Non-financial (Group) Statement for the year ended 31 December 2023. Following an indepth explanation of the statement by the Board of Management, representatives of PwC presented the key findings of their audit and answered additional questions posed by the members of the Supervisory Board. Based on the 'limited assurance' audit performed by PwC on those parts of the Management Report and certain sustainability disclosures in the integrated BMW Group Report 2023 that were not subject to a reasonable assurance engagement, PWC issued an unqualified opinion, signed for the second time by Michael Popp (Wirtschaftspr\u00fcfer) and for the first time by Annette Fink.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Following a preparatory review conducted by the Presiding Board as well as a further review at Supervisory Board level, the Statement on Corporate Governance drawn up by the Board of Management was also approved by the Supervisory Board.\n\n## Expression of appreciation by the Supervisory Board\n\nWith their great dedication and an outstanding collaborative effort during the past financial year, the members of the Board of Management and the employees of the BMW Group worldwide successfully defended the BMW brand's leading position in the global premium segment and significantly expanded the share of electric mobility in Group sales. We therefore wish to express our deep thanks and appreciation to all of them.\n\nWe are confident that the Board of Management and the BMW Group's workforce will continue to pursue the BMW Group's chosen path of sustainable and digitalised mobility in 2024, and we eagerly await the launch of the NEUE KLASSE in 2025.\n\nMunich, March 2024\n\nOn behalf of the Supervisory Board\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nNorbert Reithofer\n\nChairman of the Supervisory Board\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "Statement of the Chairman of the Board of Management\n\nYou lend us your support and give us the latitude we need to make decisions with a longterm perspective. Entrepreneur Herbert Quandt laid the foundation for this many years ago. His family's next generation and all of us who work at the Company are following his legacy. In his spirit, the Company and its employee representatives work together - negotiating firmly, but always focused on finding solutions for the future. That, too, is our lived BMW culture.\n\nAll these things make your Company strong and resilient. This is especially true in the current conditions, where we face a variety of  extremely demanding requirements in individual regions of the world, with geopolitical uncertainty and entirely new challenges constantly emerging. We provide a substantial response to all these things.\n\nMore than 150,000 associates worldwide carry your Company forwards through their hard work and dedication every day. They all value your commitment and your loyalty to the BMW Group as shareholders.\n\n## Your Company intends to stay on track for success.\n\nOur business model - individual premium mobility in its different forms and in line with regional requirements - continues to offer substantial potential for achieving profitable growth and gaining market share.\n\nWe are taking advantage of these opportunities in our rolling strategic approach and our long term corporate planning. What sets us apart is that we make conscious decisions, that are consistently based on facts, empirical findings and well-founded analysis - not driven by the current 'zeitgeist' or short-term hypes. And, of course, it takes experience and sometimes also common sense.\n\nOur BMW, MINI, Rolls-Royce and BMW Motorrad brands enjoy an excellent reputation worldwide. Our products don't just get people from A to B; they touch hearts and spark emotions. Our customers experience their mobility in a very individual way. To achieve this, we are making mobility more human, more intelligent and more sustainable.\n\nA glance in the rear-view mirror shows that we are certainly capable of doing this: BMW has overcome difficult situations many times in the past. This certainty has shaped our self-confidence for 108 years. Your Company has constantly reinvented itself - taking bold leaps in innovation at exactly the right time.\n\nTiming is key in whether innovations gain traction and the Company stays relevant, but it is also clear that:\n\n## The future is always ahead of us. And we are prepared!\n\nWe know where we are headed at all times and we know what we need. Our consistent behaviour shapes the image of your Company in the eyes of the public and among our stakeholders. People expect us to consider things carefully and to come up with practical solutions. We 'walk the talk' - people know that we take big leaps, but that we also deliver. Allelectric vehicles are projected to account for half of our global deliveries before 2030. We are right on track.\n\n## Your investment in the BMW Group must be worth it.\n\nYour Company is robust and financially strong. Our Automotive EBIT margin for finan cial year 2023 was within our upwardly adjusted target range of 9.0 to 10.5%. As you know, we are still targeting a range of 8 to 10% in the long term. At Group level, our EBT margin for 2023 of 11% exceeded our strategic target of 10%.\n\nOur profitability puts us in a position where we can once again pay you an attractive dividend. We are making major investments in our future. The same applies to 2023 as well as to the current financial year. Our R&D spending focus on our products, further electrification and digitalisation of our line-up and automated driving. At the same time, we are investing in the NEUE KLASSE mega-project, our modular kits, construction of high-voltage battery production facilities in various markets , and the new plant in Debrec en, to name just a few examples. Your Company is going to profit noticeably from all this in the coming years.\n\n## ''We make conscious decisions, that are consistently based on facts.''\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "Statement of the Chairman of the Board of Management\n\n## Strong products generate strong demand.\n\nWe delivered a total of 2.55 million vehicles to customers in 2023. As anticipated, we not only posted solid year-on-year growth, but also achieved a new all-time high at Group level. Our brands performed very well individually, too, with new all-time highs for BMW, BMW M, Rolls-Royce and BMW Motorrad. Despite the model changeover due to the extensive realignment of the brand, MINI reported higher sales than the previous year.\n\nOur core BMW brand maintains its leading position in the global premium segment. In March 2024, BMW was ranked number one in the US by the consumer portal 'Consumer Reports'. This independent platform compared test ratings, reliability, customer satisfaction and safety criteria among 34 automotive manufacturers. Four BMW models even earned the 'Green Choice' environmental seal for being among the vehicles in the United States with the lowest emissions.\n\n## Dynamic growth for our all-electric models.\n\nIn addition to significant growth in the luxury class and upper premium segment , the strongest impetus for growth last year came from our all-electric vehicles. We sold over 375,000 BEVs - which is about 75% more than the previous year. This means that, by the end of 2023, all electric vehicles made up around 15% of our total sales.\n\nThis is also reflected in our share of the global BEV market:  at 4.1%, it is already significantly higher than our share of the total global market, which remains stable at 3.3%.\n\nBy the end of 2024, we will have more than 15 all-electric models in our line-up across all brands, from MINI to BMW to Rolls -Royce. All of this speaks for our fresh and highly attractive product range - across all brands, all segments and all drive technologies.\n\nIn  2023, all our new vehicles went into production or were released onto the market, as planned, including the new BMW 5 Series and the new BMW X2 with the all- electric variants, the i5 and iX2. MINI also presented two models from the all-new MINI family at the IAA MOBILITY: the Cooper 3-door and the Countryman.\n\nBMW Motorrad celebrated its centenary in late September of last year, with Federal Chancellor Olaf Scholz attending the anniversary celebrations at the Berlin-Spandau plant. There were two main highlights: the inauguration of the BMW Motorrad Welt - the counterpart to our BMW Welt in Munich, as a delivery and visitor centre - and the premiere of the R 1300 GS. Fans all over the world have been eagerly awaiting this leap in the next GS generation. All I have to say is: pure high-tech on two wheels - earning extremely positive feedback from the trade press.\n\n## Our technological expertise is delivering results.\n\nOur broad, yet centred, approach, with systematic further development of all drive technologies, reflects BMW's typical self-belief, as well as the effectiveness of our strategy. General recognition of our strategy keeps on growing since we continue to present measurable successes in decarbonisation.\n\n## Your Company outperformed the EU CO2 fleet target by 20%.\n\nAs in previous years, we not only met the EU CO2 fleet target for the use phase in 2023, but significantly overfulfilled it: the BMW Group's numbers came in at 26.5 grams significantly below the applicable limit for the reporting year of 128.6 grams of CO2 per kilometre. We therefore ended up below the CO2 limit set for BMW by more than 20%.\n\nAs you can see, we are continuing the positive trend of recent years, through further electrification of our vehicle portfolio and by using innovative Efficient Dynamics technologies throughout our entire fleet.\n\n## Technology openness in BMW 5 Series and 5 Series Touring.\n\nFollowing on from the new BMW 5 Series Sedan, which has been available since late 2023, the new BMW 5 Series Touring is another perfect example of how our comprehensive technological expertise works in practice.\n\nThe Touring, which will be launched this spring, is especially popular in Europe. Here, also, customers will have four drive concepts to choose from: all-electric, plug-in hybrid or highly efficient diesel and petrol engines with 48-volt mild -hybrid technology. BMW is where Touring meets e-drive. No one else in this segment offers a vehicle like the all-electric BMW i5 Touring, with an electric range of over 500 kilometres.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "Statement of the Chairman of the Board of Management\n\nWe also haven't forgotten the fans of the BMW M brand: they can look forward to a new edition of the M5 this year - as both Sedan and Touring variants. Both M variants come with an impressive partially electrified drivetrain.\n\nOur plug-in hybrid models remain an important element of our drivetrain portfolio. Current Gen5 battery technology already enables an attractive range. Plug-in hybrids also provide a boost to e-mobility that should not be underestimated. Many customers discover the advantages of electric driving for the first time this way.\n\nEarly in 2024, we passed the milestone of two million electrified vehicles sold. This includes both pure electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids.\n\n## We are already testing hydrogen drivetrains in everyday situations.\n\nWe have been testing the BMW iX5 Hydrogen on the road in selected countries under everyday conditions since last year. Our pilot fleet's world tour has raised awareness of the role hydrogen can play in the energy transition - not just for mobility, but industry-wide. We see hydrogen as a possible alternative drive technology in the mid to long term.\n\nOur vehicles performed well under various climate and traffic conditions - and the public response has been overwhelmingly positive. This is understandable, since hydrogen fuel cell drivetrains combine the best of both worlds: the advantages of an emissions-free e-drive, with the fast refuelling people are used to. We also demonstrated this at the COP28 UN Climate Change Conference in Dubai. Your Company is supporting the growth of the hydrogen economy worldwide, as well as locally, including expansion of infrastructure networks for hydrogen filling stations.\n\n''We are steering the e\u00admobility ramp\u00adup smartly and precisely in line with demand in all regions of the world.''\n\n## We aim to continue our profitable growth.\n\nAll  our  brands and drivetrain variants help assure the continued profitable growth of your Company. We expect to see significant double-digit growth in sales of our BEV models again in 2024. We continue to steer the e-mobility ramp-up smartly and precisely in line with differentiated demand in all regions of the world.\n\nWe presented our latest models to members of the international media in Portugal in February 2024. Shortly afterwards, we invited 1,500 retailers from 30 European countries to Amsterdam for a glimpse of the future, including the new BMW 1 Series and the latest edition of one of our top-selling individual models, the BMW X3.\n\nThe new MINI models for 2024 include the next member of the new MINI  family, the Aceman, which will celebrate its world premiere in April 2024. This electric-only crossover in the premium compact-car segment will also bring a massive leap in digitalisation. MINI has a devoted community and creates a unique sense of life and community spirit. The new MINI family is produced at our Chinese joint venture, Spotlight, in Oxford, UK, and,  for the first time, in Germany, at the Leipzig plant. At Rolls-Royce, Spectre is the first battery-electric model to become available. Rolls-Royce has long been a standout and unrivalled in the ultra-luxury class with exclusive models.\n\nWith the CE02, BMW  Motorrad is already releasing its second all- electric model onto the market, as well as the second M motorcycle model, the M 1000 XR, and the R 1300 GS Adventure. That means there will be no fewer than three new top models at BMW Motorrad. They all illustrate the breadth of the product line-up. Everyone - and that also applies to me as a motorcycle rider - can find the right bike for their needs at BMW Motorrad.\n\n## NEW RETAIL: direct sales as win-win for everyone involved.\n\nIn January 2024, we sold and delivered our first vehicle, a MINI, through our new sales system. We have already switched the MINI brand to a direct sales model in Poland, Italy and Sweden, with other European markets to follow. In China, we have been successfully using this approach for MINI since 2023.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "Statement of the Chairman of the Board of Management\n\nFor the BMW brand, we are also setting ourselves up for direct sales access to customers in the  future  and  will  be  launching  NEW  RETAIL  for  BMW  in  Europe  from  2026 onwards.\n\nWe aim to digitalise and simplify the car-buying process for customers, with transparent, consistent pricing nationwide. This will create a win-win situation for everyone involved. Our retail partners and their profitable business model will remain an essential pillar of these new arrangements.\n\n## Automated driving: the car as digital companion.\n\nIt goes without saying that we offer our customers the newest innovations and the latest, state-of-the-art technology. Over-the-air upgrades ensure that every one of our vehicles is always digitally up to date. The art lies in mastering this process: we anticipate far in advance what our customers are going to need and want in five to ten years' time. That is how we ensure they get the best overall package from us. This is our aspiration.\n\n## And that is why we keep setting benchmarks:\n\nThe BMW 5 Series Sedan is the first car in Germany to be approved for partially automated driving at speeds up to 130 km/h on motorways. The BMW Highway Assistant allows the driver to take their hands off the steering wheel while driving longer distances. We also added a completely new feature: Active Lane Change Assistant with eye confirmation. This allows the vehicle to make an automated lane change without a steering intervention: a glance in the exterior mirror is all that is required.\n\nTaking your hands off the steering wheel and even being able to temporarily turn your attention away from the road - that is Level 3 highly automated driving. From March 2024 onwards, our customers will be able to do precisely this in the models of the new BMW 7 Series. BMW Personal Pilot L3 is the name of this new function, which takes over driving in certain defined traffic situations and manages speed, distance and lane tracking autonomously.\n\nFor us, the highest level of premium functionality goes hand in hand with maximum safety for our customers and all road users. We therefore opened the Future Mobility Development Centre in Sokolov in the Czech Republic in summer 2023, where we are testing automated driving and parking functions, up to and including fully automated driving (Level 4). At this location, we are able to simulate virtually all situations that occur in road traffic and thus ensure the maturity of our technical solutions.\n\n## NEUE KLASSE - vision becomes reality.\n\nWith its spectacular Vision Vehicles, your Company showcases time and again indicates the direction in which we are taking mobility, in line with the major global topics of the future through bold leaps in innovation and responsible action. This is what our NEUE KLASSE mega-project represents in a unique way.\n\nLast year, there were two major milestones: at the CES in Las Vegas at the start of the year, we unveiled our BMW i Vision Dee, full of digital innovations. Then, in September, at the IAA MOBILITY, we presented our BMW VISION Neue Klasse. No other car at the IAA MOBILITY received as much media coverage and attention as the BMW VISION Neue Klasse.\n\nWe also presented this Vision Vehicle to our associates at an exclusive evening event. The interest was huge. Up to 700 associates from across Germany were selected by lottery to attend the event live with a companion. Another 25,000 watched the live stream or the recording of the event. That is a sixth of our global workforce. I see that as genuine interest in our joint future project, the NEUE KLASSE.\n\n''We anticipate far in advance what our customers want. That is how we ensure they get the best overall package from us.''\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "Statement of the Chairman of the Board of Management\n\nThe NEUE KLASSE is so much more than just a single car; it is an entirely new generation of BMW models - all of them developed with an all-electric heart, fully digitalised and with a clear focus on sustainability. The innovations of the NEUE KLASSE will benefit all future BMW models.\n\nWe are preparing to launch the NEUE KLASSE onto the market at an unprecedented pace from 2025 onwards, with six models within just 24 months of the start of production. We showed the scope of the NEUE KLASSE in a very concrete way for the first time at the BMW Group Annual Conference on 21 March 2024. Its offering ranges from sporty sedan to X model. The BMW VISION Neue Klasse and our newest Vision Vehicle - the BMW VISION Neue Klasse X - represent these two bookends.\n\nI can promise you that both Vision Vehicles will be on the market soon in a very similar form. In-between these two models, there is plenty of room for everything that will define the BMW brand in the future.\n\nThe Board of Management members already had the chance to drive prototypes of the NEUE KLASSE. What a fantastic driving experience! The first camouflaged prototypes are already being tested on the roads and we will be building the first pre-production vehicles before the end of the year.\n\nAfter the official start of production, in 2025, at our newest BMW plant in Debrecen, Hungary, the NEUE KLASSE will also come off the production line at our oldest plant in Munich from 2026, with other locations worldwide to follow. Incidentally, one out of every two BMWs leaving the Munich production line is already fully electric today. From 2027 onwards, our more than 100-year-old main plant will build only electric vehicles.\n\n''The NEUE KLASSE is much more than just a single car. It is an entirely new generation of BMW models \u00ad \u00ad\u00ad  all of them developed with an all\u00adelectric heart, fully digitalised and with a clear focus on sustainability.''\n\n## Mobility is movement - and movement requires energy and functioning supply chains.\n\nWe are talking here about powerful, innovative and sustainably produced battery cells - in other words, high-voltage batteries. In the models of the NEUE KLASSE, we will be using our newly developed round lithium-ion battery cells, which have been optimised for the new architecture, for the very first time.\n\nOur sixth-generation BMW eDrive technology represents an enormous leap in technology, compared to the previous generation: we are increasing energy density by more than 20%, improving charging speed by up to 30% and boosting range by around 30% - at the same time as lowering costs. We are also reducing CO2 emissions from cell production by up to 60%.\n\nFor both basic research and development of mass -manufacturing processes for high-voltage batteries, your Company is relying on in-house expertise. We want to understand every aspect of the high-voltage battery. To do so, we have created the necessary conditions for this with the Battery Cell Competence Centre in Munich and the Cell Manufacturing Competence Centre in Parsdorf, Bavaria, enabling us to span all value creation processes involved in cell production; this is a crucial step for us.\n\nThe Gen6 batteries for our plants in Bavaria will be supplied from our planned new location in Irlbach-Stra\u00dfkirchen from 2026 onwards. Before embarking on the building project, we sought frank and open dialogue with local residents. We were very pleased that they voted strongly in favour of our site and see this as confirmation of our efforts.\n\nYour Company is building production facilities for BMW high-voltage batteries not just in Lower Bavaria, but all over the world - always in close proximity to our vehicle plants in Hungary, the US, Mexico, China and Thailand. Our strategic 'local for local' approach also guarantees short transport distances for high-voltage batteries and secures our supply against unforeseen events in different regions of the world.\n\nWith our 'i  Supply  Chain'  strategy,  we  are  ensuring  resilient,  excellent  and  digital  supply chains in all areas. Our plants worldwide need supplying with 36 million parts every day - at the right time, in the best quality and in the right quantity. For the digitalisation of our supply chains, we are relying on Catena-X, a shared data ecosystem for automotive manufacturers, suppliers and subcontractors, as well as recycling companies in the future. This digital collaboration increases efficiency and transparency - for example, around the carbon footprint and options for tracing components and raw materials.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Your Company did exceptionally well to make it into the top 10 , and  was,  in  fact,  the  highest-ranked  automotive  manufacturer  in  the  global  comparison. Three criteria were decisive for this assessment: revenue growth, sustainability and employee satisfaction. These three are not opposing factors but belong together.\n\nWith regard to employees: in autumn 2023, we once again asked our global team to share their opinion. For the first time, all 150,000 associates worldwide were able to take part. 84% took advantage of this opportunity.\n\nThe vote was unequivocal: 85% support our strategy - our BMW way. Another very clear majority of 88% said they would recommend our Company as an employer. 93% are proud to work for the BMW Group.\n\nIs there any better foundation for continuing on our successful course together?\n\n## 2023 was another strong team effort.\n\nPersonally, and on behalf of the entire Board of Management, I would like to thank all our associates. Everyone made a valuable contribution. I would also like to thank all our customers worldwide, our retail organisation and our suppliers.\n\nAll of us at BMW are united by a can-do spirit: think ahead - perform - succeed!\n\n''Our customers experience their mobility in a very individual way. We therefore are continually laying the foundation for our future success. That is continuous progress. ''\n\n## Dear Shareholders,\n\nOur business environment will again be dominated by a great many challenges this financial year, including weak economic development in several markets, the price development in the automotive sector, high interest rates and the uncertainty created by geopolitical shifts.\n\nThat is why it is so decisive that we recognise and systematically exploit our opportunities. It is important to me that all of us at the BMW Group approach our tasks with self-belief, confidence  and  the  necessary  grit.  I  travel  the  world  a  lot,  visiting  our  markets  and  facilities. Everywhere I go, I see how valuable and important individual mobility is in many people's everyday lives.\n\n## Courage, pride in performance and resilience.\n\nThat is what makes your Company different. We dare to chart our own course, even in turbulent times; we are able to withstand the headwinds, as long as we are convinced that we are on the right path.\n\nYour Company is a high-performance organisation. That is why we once again have ambitious plans for 2024: on the automotive side, 14 new models will go into production and BMW Motorrad will release a further 12 new models - not to mention numerous model updates and engine variants. We have never postponed a launch and we will not waver from this.\n\nAll of this shows that we are continually laying the foundation for our future success. That is continuous progress. In other words: \u2197 DRIVING THE NEXT ERA .\n\nThat is why the following applies to your Company: Strong today - strong tomorrow.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOliver Zipse\n\nChairman of the Board of Managemen\n\n<!-- image -->",

The BMW Group kept investors, analysts and rating agencies up to date again in 2023 with its regular quarterly and annual reporting. The BMW Group has stepped up its communication with investors  who  consider  sustainability  criteria  in  their  investment decisions in the past few years and now meets this group's information needs with in-person and virtual ESG conferences, in addition to individual and group meetings. The Group's communication  focused  on  the  further  development  of  the  business model, digitalisation and other technology trends in the automotive industry, sustainability in the supply chain and the ramp-up of electromobility. In 2023, the Group also focused on measuring the carbon footprint of its pension plan assets in the UK and Germany, and validating  the  data  available  for  this  purpose.  The \u2197 TCFD Report was created for the UK BOPS* Plan, reiterating the target to achieve carbon neutrality for the scheme's asset portfolio by 2050.\n\nThe volume of non -liquid pension plan assets invested in our various impact funds continues to grow according to schedule, with several new subscriptions exercised in the form of fund-based investments. The investments made to date in this area relate not only to climate protection, but also to other Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) set out by the UN. Investments that have a beneficial effect on the climate are at the forefront of the impact funds.\n\n## Outlook\n\nThe BMW Group will continue to interact closely and constructively with its stakeholders and develop existing dialogue opportunities  in  2024, and will continue to maintain active dialogue with capital market players such as investors, financial analysts and rating agencies. As in previous years, our activities will include direct dialogue as well as participation in in -person and virtual ESG conferences.\n\nMoreover, plans are in place for the coming year to expand the scope of recording the carbon emissions associated with those investments,  with the  primary  aim  of  reliably  assessing  and transparently documenting the compatibility of our investments with the climate goals enshrined in the Paris Agreement. To the extent possible, our aim is to take account of non-liquid investments in the Group's reporting on sustainability, or at least for all such investments to be reviewed from a sustainability perspective.\n\n## The Board of Management's collaboration with stakeholders to identify and manage impacts\n\nThe Board of Management keeps up to date with stakeholder feedback and positions through a variety of channels, for example in regular Board meetings, in direct dialogue with stakeholder groups  (such  as  investors  or  political  decision  makers)  and through briefings conducted by BMW Group departments, especially prior to attending major events such as OECD conferences or the Group's Annual General Meetings. The Chairman of the Supervisory  Board  also  maintains  regular  contact  with  stakeholders. The members of the Supervisory Board attend the Annual General Meeting, and many of them also interact with stakeholders as part of their other activities and mandates.\n\n## Approach taken to engage stakeholders\n\nThe BMW Group continuously communicates with a large number of different stakeholder groups at all locations and in all markets.  Appropriate  forms  and  methods  of  engagement  are  selected, depending on the situation.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- * BMW Operations Pension Scheme.",

In 2023, the rating agencies Moody's and Standard & Poor's (S&P) both confirmed BMW  AG's high investment-grade credit ratings within a challenging market environment. Moody's long-term rating remains at 'A2 with stable outlook',  while  the  short-term  rating  is  unchanged  at  'P-1'. S&P's long-term rating remains at 'A with stable outlook', with a short-term rating of 'A-1'.\n\nThe credit ratings reflect BMW's continued strong operating performance. The credit rating is also backed up by the Company's solid capital structure, balanced financial policy and solid liquidity position. Moreover, the increasing proportion of Group sales of all-electric vehicles is seen as a positive factor. With this profile, the rating agencies view BMW  AG as well prepared to master the numerous  challenges  arising  in  conjunction  with  the  transformation of the automotive industry and in terms of future macroeconomic developments (including volatile prices, supply bottlenecks, geopolitical upheavals, inflation and rising interest rates).\n\nThese above-average credit ratings are testimony to BMW AG's excellent  creditworthiness.  Accordingly,  BMW  AG  enjoys  good access to international capital markets and benefits from attractive refinancing conditions.\n\n| Company rating   | Moody's 1   | Standard  & Poor's 2   |\n|------------------|-------------|------------------------|\n| Long-term debt   | A2          | A                      |\n| Short-term debt  | P-1         | A-1                    |\n| Outlook          | stable      | stable                 |\n\n- 1 Moody's scale for long-term ratings: Aaa to C. Moody's scale for short-term ratings: P-1 (Prime1) to NP (Not Prime).\n- 2 S&P scale for long-term ratings: AAA to D. S&P scale for short-term ratings: A-1 to D.\n\n## GOOD PLACEMENT IN SUSTAINABILITY RATINGS\n\nThe BMW Group again achieved a good ranking in prestigious sustainability ratings in 2023, confirming its strong position in this respect. The BMW Group has an AA rating from MSCI ESG, a score of 24.8 from Sustainalytics, and a C+ rating and Prime status from ISS ESG.",

Trends with significant implications for the automotive industry are analysed and evaluated and the underlying premises are scrutinised. Taking into account these influencing factors, characterised by their in parts rapid rate of change, we continually refine our corporate strategy and adjust our strategic objectives accordingly.\n\nThe corporate strategy and strategic targets of the BMW Group form the starting point for the departments to define concrete approaches and implementation measures. This process is based on strategic fields of action and key success factors.\n\nThe strategy process allows plans to be drawn up for different scenarios to account for increasingly volatile and challenging environmental conditions, thereby ensuring flexibility and responsiveness  for  the  BMW  Group.  The  BMW  Group's  strategy  is based  on  fundamental  values  such  as  the  integrity  of  our actions. \u2197 Compliance and Human Rights\n\nThe strategy  is  integrated  into  annually  revised,  longer-range corporate  planning  using  a  closed  loop-based  planning  and management system. Its implementation is monitored by a target system that is comprised of the aspects of finance, customers, processes, learning and development. \u2197 Performance Indicators and Performance Management\n\n## ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS\n\nA company's success depends to a large extent on its ability to recognise changes in its environment early on, plan for different scenarios, effectively manage risks and take advantage of opportunities that may arise from such changes. \u2197 Risks and Opportunities To this end, we continuously monitor the business environment in our key regions, using available data to analyse the trends and developments that could affect our business in the future. In 2023, we undertook an extensive update and review of our environmental analysis, significantly broadening the scope of subject areas considered. Regular \u2197 Dialogue with Stakeholders within the scope  of  the  established  BMW Group XChange formats completes the picture from the analysis of external and environmental factors.\n\nAlongside the current development directions, certain trends are gaining momentum, notably within digital technologies and the political  landscape.  The  most  significant  trends  set  to  have  a long-term effect on the BMW Group's business model are classified according to their impact on society, technology, business, environment and politics.\n\n## Society\n\nIndividual mobility remains a fundamental human need, though vehicle ownership continues to depend to a large extent on income, household size and location. The coronavirus pandemic has not had any significant or lasting effects on mobility behaviour in general. On-demand mobility (ODM) services, especially in urban areas, remain a supplementary option.

This area is  undergoing  constant  change,  with  the  market  environment evolving  dynamically  and  new  collaborative  models  emerging. New solutions, particularly in artificial intelligence, are emerging and are finding applications across all aspects of life. Modern vehicles are already one of the most complex digital items owned by consumers. Vehicle requirements are also increasingly influenced  by  the  digital  ecosystems  that  customers  interact  with every day. Automobiles should be a reliable source of support in everyday life, fit  seamlessly into a person's living environment and create a holistic overall experience. Software updates with further functional developments are expected and generally becoming standard. \u2197 Innovation, Digitalisation and Customer Orientation\n\nAlongside digitalisation, development of automated/autonomous driving remains a key expectation for the future of mobility. Initial offerings of Level 4 * features are expected to launch in the market before 2030, although widespread adoption is expected to occur only after 2030. \u2197 Products\n\nThe acceleration of electromobility worldwide continues to be an important prerequisite on the path to climate neutral ity, although the pace of adoption is expected to vary regionally. In the long term, there will be a parallel range of electric vehicles and combustion engine vehicles available worldwide. However, the number of all-electric models in the automotive industry as a whole is expected to continue to increase. Addressing remaining uncertainties, including regulations, the swift and widespread development of charging infrastructure and the availability of raw materials will be essential for the future expansion of this sector. It is necessary to increase the pace at which capacities are expanded in order to meet the ever-increasing demand for climate-neutral and green energy across industries. The share of regenerative energies in the energy mix is on the rise, increasing the volatility of the entire energy supply and making it increasingly difficult to maintain the stability of networks. Due to these factors and the limited capacities of distribution networks, every effort needs to\n\nbe continued to ensure that electromobility is a long-term success. \u2197 Electromobility\n\n## Environment\n\nAs governments around the world work to transpose the goals of the Paris Climate Agreement's carbon reduction targets into national laws, an ambitious orientation towards climate policy will serve as an important basis for successful action for businesses. It is equally vital to prepare for the consequences of current and anticipated  changes  brought  about  by  climate  change,  which create a tangible urgency to take action. The role of hydrogen  as an energy source is set to undergo a fundamental shift, propelled by the global imperative for decarbonisation.\n\n## Business\n\nBusiness and the environment are closely linked and influence each  other.  Thus,  alongside  carbon  emissions,  resource  efficiency will also gain in importance. The demand for secondary materials and recycling is also rising, for instance, due to quota requirements. Simultaneously, this development is giving rise to cross\u00adindustry  initiatives  and  opportunities for new  business models. \u2197 Circular Economy, Resource Efficiency and Renewable Energy\n\nCompetition  among  various  political  systems  is  a  dominating force in international politics, influencing changes in international trade flows using instruments like sanctions, tariffs and subsidies. The need to secure supply chains is intensifying due to the dual challenges of climate change and geopolitical risks.\n\n## Politics\n\nPolitics and regulations are narrowing the scope for action across the entire automotive value creation model. There is an increasing variety of legislation in all regions of the world.\n\nIn urban areas within the European Union, infrastructure bottlenecks and selective reallocation of road space are likely to result in increased traffic congestion and reduced accessibility. Simultaneously, there is an increasing trend towards policies that discourage car use in city centres. The planned deployment of smart city technologies would, however, primarily affect cities in China.\n\n## CORNERSTONES OF THE STRATEGY\n\nmind.'\n\nThe BMW Group's strategy is oriented to its corporate purpose: 'The BMW Group exists to move body, heart and It is the driving force, the guiding principle and the orientation for our employees, and our commitment to our active role in society. Its long-term focus guides us purposefully through the extensive transformation of the entire automotive industry and beyond.\n\nTransitioning to the specific details of the BMW Group strategy, the BMW Group Impact broadens the Company's long -term strategic vision and underscores its ambitio n to contribute to broader societal  development.  'We  make  individual  mobility  more  human, intelligent and responsible - creating an inspiring future for all of us.'\n\nWith this in mind, the BMW Group's corporate strategy (BMW Group strategy) defines the strategic framework and lays the  foundation  for  the  Company  to  maintain  a  consistent  and market-oriented focus on profitability, growth and sustainability, even in an increasingly dynamic environment. The BMW Group strategy outlines targets in four areas: position, direction, strategic approach and collaboration.",

It aims to find the right balance between business, the environment and society. The key areas of focus  within  the  strategy  are  electrification,  digitalisation  and sustainability or circularity. This enables us to seamlessly merge enjoyment  and  responsibility,  without  compromising,  and  to achieve our growth and profitability objectives.\n\nThe BMW Group is committed to the Paris Climate Agreement. To achieve this, the BMW Group promotes the reduction of carbon emissions throughout the whole life cycle of its products as well as the principles of the circular economy with a verifiable track record of continuous improvement - from the supply chain to production, the use phase and the recycling of its products. For this reason, the BMW Group has laid out measurable, sciencebased targets to be reached by 2030; these are firmly established across the company (base year 2019). Carbon emissions are to be reduced as follows:\n\n- 1. An average of 80% carbon reduction at our own plants and  locations (Scope 1 and  2)  per  vehicle produced (\u2197 Carbon emissions generated at BMW Group locations)\n- 2. Carbon reduction during the vehicle's use phase (Scope 3 downstream) by an average of at least 50% per kilometre driven. Increased efficiency in our electrified models and the new generation of combustion engine technology will make this possible. An additional driving force for this is the dynamic  growth  in  demand  for  our  electrified  vehicles \u2197 Electromobility , \u2197 Automotive segment\n- 3. An average of at least 20% * carbon reduction in the supply chain  (Scope  3  upstream)  per  vehicle  produced \u2197 Carbon emissions in the supply chain\n\nWe have joined the Science-Based Targets initiative (SBTi) for this purpose. This will enable us to guarantee transparency and comparability in the validation and measurement of our targets and, at the same time, ensure they are in line with the latest scientific findings and  regulatory  requirements.  These  are  described in more detail in the chapter \u2197 Carbon Emissions .\n\n- \u2197 Performance management parameters such as \u2197 Carbon Emissions over the entire product life cycle are important \u2197 Performance indicators during the development phase of our vehicle projects. The Board of Management receives and discusses a status report on sustainability every quarter and derives appropriate measures as required.\n\nThe BMW Group is actively working on numerous projects and initiatives to improve the framework conditions for electromobility, including the expansion of charging infrastructure on a broad basis. The ambitious goals of the Paris Climate Agreement are designed to tackle climate change in the transport sector, requiring a combination of modern drive technologies that are closely aligned with customer needs and different mobility requirements around the world. In addition to all-electric models, plug-in hybrids and modern combustion engine technology also make an important contribution to the reduction of global carbon emissions. The BMW Group is also forging ahead with its work with hydrogen. \u2197 Products",

The BMW Group is shaping the future of sustainable mobility with its passion and strong capacity for innovation. Thanks to its exciting products, the BMW Group is  able  to  achieve  maximum  customer  satisfaction  and brand strength, and thus grow its market share.\n\nEconomic performance is a very important aspect of our corporate management system and is anchored in our objective of harnessing growth potential and securing our profitability targets. This is supported by our ambitious financial standards, which are linked to the strategic key figures EBIT margin in the Automotive segment (between 8 and 10%), RoCE in the Automotive segment of at least 18% and an EBT margin in the Group of more than 10%. \u2197 Performance Indicators and Performance Management\n\nThe quality and reliability of all of our products and services are the critical drivers for customer satisfaction, enthusiasm and the economic success of the BMW Group. We are therefore committed to a comprehensive approach to quality, centred on delivering the best possible customer experience. The 'Mission Quality' initiative was launched across the Company in 2023. As a key area  of  focus  for  the  Company,  the  initiative  promotes the strengthening of quality awareness and focuses on the individual contributions of all employees.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDigitalisation is consistently extended beyond the vehicle \u2197 Innovation, Digitalisation and Customer Orientation , encompassing both corporate and customer processes, as well as along the automotive value chain, enhancing the resilience and business agility of the BMW  Group.  There  are  corresponding  initiatives in all areas of the Company. Our 'Digital Process & Impact' initiative is  an  example  of  commitment  to  significantly  accelerating  the digitalisation of our internal processes and operations across the Company, harnessing digital potential in every area through the use of digitalised process management. The dedicated process and digitalisation functions ensure the consistent implementation and corresponding development of expertise across all departments. Concurrently, March 2023 marked the launch of DIGITAL  BOOST,  one  of  the  most  comprehensive  training  programme in the BMW Group's history. This virtual training programme, designed for employees in indirect roles across all levels of the organisation, delivers insights and opportunities in digitalisation on both national and international fronts. The aim is for all employees to acquire the same basic knowledge of digitalisation, enabling them to identify potential within their own areas of responsibility and harness it for the benefit of the BMW Group. BMW Group had introduced at least one all -electric model across all its brands and segments. In 2023, the extended-wheelbase version of the iX1 for the  Chinese market, the BMW i5 * sedan and the Rolls-Royce Spectre * were launched on the market. In 2023, deliveries  of  all-electric  automobiles  increased  by  more  than 74.1%, reaching 375,716 automobiles, up from 215,752 automobiles in 2022. \u2197 Electromobility\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Strategic approach Where is the BMW Group heading?\n\nThe BMW Group is focused on its customers worldwide and on meeting their different requirements. It does so by understanding the needs of its current and future customers and exceeding their expectations. It combines ground-breaking technologies, emotional products and individual customer care to create a unique overall experience. The fields of action electrification, digitalisation and circularity are of particular importance.\n\nWe recognised the importance of electromobility  early  on  and have been working resolutely to accelerate the adoption of allelectric and  connected  mobility.

With  intelligent  vehicle  architectures and flexible production facilities, the company is well-prepared for the  continued  expansion  of  electromobility.  Society's  acceptance of electromobility will depend on trends in customer demand, regional regulations and the development of a suitable framework, with a particular focus on infrastructure expansion. The BMW Group is currently planning for all-electric vehicles to account for more than 50% of all vehicles by 2030. The RollsRoyce brand is set to become all-electric by 2030, and the MINI brand will follow suit by the early 2030s. \u2197 Electromobility\n\nThe launch of the BMW CE 04 electric scooter has successfully established BMW Motorrad's position in the electromobility landscape. Building on this success, the eParkourer - the BMW CE 02 - is set to advance the electrification strategy for urban mobility in April 2024. \u2197 Motorcyles segment\n\nIn addition to delivering product substance, we also offer customers a 360\u00b0 approach with an appropriate charging ecosystem.

In an increasingly digital environment with changing customer needs, the Company relies on a future-oriented sales structure with a focus on the digitalisation of the customer interface and direct customer access. The aim is to offer the industry's best premium customer experience. In this context, the My BMW App and MINI App play a significant role with over 12 million users (as at December 2023). More than three million customers (as at December 2023) access the apps every day. Using their smartphones, they interact with their BMW or MINI vehicles, the BMW Group itself and the BMW and MINI dealerships, and also receive personalised offers. The relationship with the customer thus becomes even closer.\n\nBy  enabling  smooth  transitions  between  physical  and  digital channels and launching direct sales, the BMW Group is improving direct customer connections - an essential step for providing the best customer experience \u2197 Automotive segment .

The stable relationships  that  have  grown  in  our  partner  networks  over  time  are based on the same values as those at the BMW Group. They allow us to maximise our effectiveness and work together to lead the Company to success. Experiences from the crisis years have further strengthened these relationships, as exemplified by our supply chains. \u2197 Purchasing and Supplier Network\n\nCircularity is a key focus for the BMW Group in the drive towards more resource-efficient  mobility.  The  concept  revolves  around recycling materials to the fullest extent, ensuring that resources are utilised sustainably and retain their value over time. This approach opens up a range of opportunities across the entire value chain. Reusing valuable resources reduces our reliance on primary raw materials and their fluctuating prices. Furt hermore, the use of high-quality secondary materials significantly reduces the carbon footprint of our vehicles. \u2197 Circular Economy, Resource Efficiency and Renewable Energy . We aim to progress gradually towards a circular economy, from designing for circularity through to increasing the use of secondary materials for parts and components and ultimately advancing to the recycling of end-of-life vehicles.\n\nand\n\nA central aspect of the revamped sales structure is the transition to direct sales. After the pilot market in South Africa, MINI was the first Group brand to implement the new sales model in China in March 2023, followed by Europe in January 2024 with Italy, Poland  and  Sweden.  The  remaining  European  countries  will transition over the course of 2024 and 2025 and the BMW brand will  follow  suit  in  Europe  in  2026.  Going  forward,  our  existing trading partners will continue in their roles as active commercial intermediaries between the BMW Group customers.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe trading partners will be closely involved in the implementation. The new sales structure offers an attractive and sustainable business model for these partners, and they will continue to be the face for customers in the future, where they can focus on providing the best advice and support. At the same time, we aim to achieve consistent prices across each sales channel.\n\n## Collaboration How does the BMW Group achieve this?\n\nThe BMW Group constantly strives for the best results, supporting its employees with the discovery and development of their potential so they are able to remain productive. We support and challenge strong teams with complementary strengths who work together to achieve the best solutions in a complex environment. We see diversity as an important element of our competitiveness. \u2197 Employees and Society The diversity metric defines the share of women in management positions as a key performance indicator and a strategic target variable. The aim is to increase the share\n\nTogether with our cooperation partners, we realise potential by accessing  more  expertise  and  improving  our  profitability  and technology footprint. In addition to the collaboration with Qualcomm in the advancement of assisted and automated driving, the development partnership between the BMW  Group and Solid Power, for instance, presents advantages for both companies. Examples  include our  Cell  Manufacturing  Competence  Centre (CMCC) in Parsdorf near Munich, where our expertise in designing and manufacturing solid-state cells is continuously expanded through a dedicated prototype line, bringing significant value to our partnership with Solid Power. We continuously expand our collaborations to unlock additional potential for value creation in the Group. \u2197 Innovation, Digitalisation and Customer Orientation\n\nThe BMW Group invests in the development of employee skills, with  the  view  that  continuous  training  guarantees  jobs  worldwide. \u2197 Employees and Society The restructuring of our Munich headquarters is an example of this commitment. The complete restructuring of an entire plant, including combustion engine vehicle production, to 100% electromobility, will be implemented by 2027 while production is ongoing.

Capital is considered to be employed profitably when the amount of profit generated on a sustained basis exceeds the cost of equity and debt capital. This strategy also secures the desired degree of corporate autonomy in the long term.\n\nThe BMW Group's performance management system is based on  a  multilayered  structure.

In order to influence long-term corporate  performance,  additional  performance  indicators  are taken  into  account  within  the  management  system  at  Group level. In this context, the value added serves as one of several indicators to measure the contribution made to enterprise value during the financial year.\n\nThis aspiration to add value is measured at both Group and segment level by means of the key performance indicators. The link between value added and the relevant value drivers is presented in a simplified form below.\n\n## BMW Group - Value drivers\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Managing sustainability\n\nThe BMW Group's long-term corporate strategy is determined by the Board of Management. Responsibility for implementing the Group's sustainability goals also lies with the full Board. Significant decisions are therefore evaluated from the point of view of sustainability. This ensures that sustainability issues are systematically  integrated  in  decision-making  processes  and  to compensation at top management levels. As part of the procedures for managing sustainability on an integrated basis at corporate level, a Group target system has been created, which applies to specific departments.\n\nThe BMW Group has set itself the target of decarbonising its vehicle fleet by at least 40% over the entire life cycle by 2030, based on the reference year 2019. In this context, specific targets have been set for the scopes of the vehicle's use phase, production and supply chain ( \u2197 Position , \u2197 Carbon Emissions ). This entails setting specific carbon targets for each vehicle project, managing them through digital processes and tracking their attainment.\n\nAn integrated approach to target management ensures that the BMW Group's vehicle projects make a positive contribution towards achieving the sustainability targets that have been set. Furthermore, the BMW Group will consistently increase its use of secondary raw materials. The Group intends to already have made significant progress by 2025 with the introduction of the first X model of the NEUE KLASSE. Non-financial performance indicators such as carbon emissions and, in future, secondary raw materials quotas are therefore key performance indicators for all new vehicle projects. It is also ensured that financial aspects are taken into consideration and  the  most  effective measures are prioritised for implementation in all areas. The overall result is a cohesive management model across all aspects of the business. \u2197 GRI Index: 2-13\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "The BMW Group Strategy\n\n## Managing operational performance at segment level\n\nAt segment level, operational performance is managed using an aggregated approach based on returns on capital. Depending on the business model, the segments are measured on the basis of return on total capital or return on equity.\n\nReturn on capital employed (RoCE) is used for the Automotive and Motorcycles segments and return on equity (RoE) for the Financial  Services  segment.  These  indicators  combine  a  wide range of relevant economic information, such as profitability (return on sales) and capital efficien cy (capital turnover) to measure segment performance and the development of enterprise value.\n\ncalculated as the sum of intangible assets, property, plant and equipment and net working capital, the latter comprising inventories and trade receivables less trade payables. The amount of capital  employed  increased  in  light  of  the  full  consolidation  of BMW Brilliance in the BMW Group Financial Statements as at 11 February 2022. The increase arose primarily due to the takeover of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, as well as the capitalisation of reacquired rights in conjunction with the purchase price allocation. The RoCE will be impacted temporarily by the higher capital base as well as the related amortisation expense expected to be recorded.\n\nFurthermore, the Automotive segment manages its compliance with fleet carbon emissions requirements in regulated markets. This also includes the share of all- electric automobiles in deliveries  reported  since  the  2023  financial  year.  The  proportion  of electrified automobiles, including PHEV models, was reported as a  performance  indicator  until  2022. \u2197 Performance  indicators As compliance with regulatory requirements is a significant factor in the BMW Group's success, business decisions relating to vehicle projects also take targets for fleet carbon emissions account. \u2197 Managing sustainability\n\nThe strategic target for RoCE is 18%.\n\nDue to the special significance of RoCE for the BMW Group, the Automotive segment is also managed on the basis of a number of additional key performance indicators that have a significant impact  on  RoCE  and  hence  on  segment  performance.  These value drivers include deliveries and the operating return on sales (EBIT margin: segment profit before financial result as a p ercentage of segment revenues) as a key figure for profitability in the segment.\n\n## Automotive segment\n\nThe most comprehensive key performance indicator used for the Automotive segment is RoCE, which provides information on the profitability of capital employed and business operations. Value driver analyses are used to interpret the causes of a change in RoCE and derive suitable measures to influence its development.\n\nThe capital employed items taken into account reflect the focus of operational segment management.

        "page_content": "The BMW Group Strategy\n\n## Strategic management at Group level\n\nStrategic management and the measurement of its financial impact are coordinated primarily at Group level in conjunction with the long-term corporate plan. Group profit/loss before tax provides a comprehensive measure of the Group's overall corporate performance after consolidation effects and enables a transparent comparison over time. Other key performance indicators at Group level are the size of the workforce at the year-end as well as the share of women in management positions. By 2025, the BMW Group aims to increase the share of women in management positions to 22%. \u2197 Strategy Process\n\nThe information provided by these key performance indicators at Group level is complemented by the two financial performance indicators  of  pre-tax  return  on  sales  and  value  added.  Value added, as a highly aggregated performance indicator, also provides an insight into capital efficiency and the (opportunity) cost of  capital  required  to  generate  Group  profit.  A  positive  value added means that a return on investment above the cost of capital has been achieved.\n\nCapital  employed  comprises  the  amount  of  Group  equity  and pension provisions as well as the financial liabilities of the Automotive and Motorcycles segments employed on average at the end of each of the last five quarters.\n\nThe earnings  amount  corresponds  to  Group  profit/loss  before tax, adjusted for interest expense incurred in conjunction with the pension provisions and on the financial liabilities of the Automotive  and  Motorcycles  segments  (profit/loss  before  interest expense and tax). The cost of capital is the minimum rate of return expected by capital providers in return for the capital employed. Since capital employed comprises an equity capital (e.g. share capital) and a debt capital element (e.g. bonds), the overall cost of  capital  is  determined  on  the  basis  of  the  weighted  average rates for equity and debt capital, measured using standard market procedures. The pre-tax average weighted cost of capital for the BMW Group in 2023 was 12%, unchanged from the previous year.\n\n## Value added Group\n\n|              | Earnings amount   | Cost of capital (equity + debt capital)   | Cost of capital (equity + debt capital)   |        |       | Value added Group   | Value added Group   |\n|--------------|-------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|--------|-------|---------------------|---------------------|\n| in \u20ac million | 2023              | 2022                                      | 2023                                      | 2022   | 2023  | 2022                |                     |\n| BMW Group    | 17,257            | 23,730                                    | 11,615                                    | 11,194 | 5,642 | 12,536              |                     |\n\nEarnings amount -\n\nCost of capital\n\nEarnings amount -\n\n=\n\n- (cost of capital rate x capital employed) =\n\nIn order to determine the internal rate of return, risk -adjusted cost of capital rates are based on the average of actual rates in recent years. In light of the long-term nature of product and investment decisions, the following internal rates of return are used in conjunction with segment management:\n\n|   2023 |      | in %  2022         |\n|--------|------|--------------------|\n|   12   | 12   | Automotive         |\n|   12   | 12   | Motorcycles        |\n|   13.4 | 13.4 | Financial Services |\n\n## Value-based management for project decisions\n\nOperational business in the Automotive and Motorcycles segments is largely shaped by the life-cycle-dependent character of investment projects that have a substantial influence on future performance. Project-related decisions are therefore a crucial element of financial management in the BMW Group.  Project decisions are based on calculations derived from the expected cash flows of each individual project. Calculations are made for the complete term of a project, incorporating future years in which the project is expected to generate cash flows.\n\nProject decisions are taken on the basis of net present value and the internal rate of return calculated for the project. The net present value indicates the extent to which the project will be able to generate future net cash inflows over and above the cost of capital. A project with a positive net present value enhances future value added and therefore results in an increase in enterprise value. The project's internal rate of return measures the average return on the capital employed in the project. For all project decisions, the project criteria and long-term impact on periodic results  are  measured  and  incorporated  in  the  long-term  Group plan. This approach enables an analysis of the impact of project decisions on periodic earnings and rates of return for each year during the term of the project.\n\n## Board of Management remuneration\n\nPerformance criteria for the variable remuneration paid to members of the Board of Management are based on the key strategic targets  and  performance  indicators.

According to calculations of the International  Monetary  Fund  (IMF),  global  gross  domestic  product (GDP) grew by 3.1% in 2023. While the US and China recorded stronger growth than in the previous year, economic growth in Europe weakened.\n\nIn the eurozone, growth in 2023 was 0.5% due to high inflation rates and the resulting fall in demand. In Germany, GDP contracted by 0.3% as a result of rising prices, declining export demand and the low level of investments in light of higher interest rates. In France (+0.9%), Italy (+0.7%) and Spain (+2.5%), economic growth was more robust. The UK experienced a significant slowdown in growth to 0.1%.\n\nIn the USA, the economy proved very resilient in the face of rising interest rates and grew by 2.5% in the reporting period. A sustained  low  level  of  unemployment  in  combination  with  rising wages helped boost consumption. In China, the growth rate in 2023 stood at 5.2%, slightly higher than the target set by the government. The momentum resulted in particular from catchup effects following the end of coronavirus lockdowns.\n\nThe Japanese economy recovered well during the reporting period with a growth rate of 1.8%, benefiting from stronger export demand on the back of the depreciated currency.\n\n## Higher benchmark interest rates in many markets and a strong euro\n\nAt the beginning of 2023, inflation remained relatively high in a number of countries. Only in the second half of the year did the inflation rate gradually begin to decline. Therefore, many central banks continued to pursue their restrictive monetary policies and raise benchmark interest rates.",

For the year as a whole, the average exchange rate for the Chinese currency was 7.66 renminbi to the euro.\n\nThe Japanese currency fluctuated between 138 and 164 yen to the euro during 2023. Based on an average exchange rate of 152 yen, the Japanese currency fell in value against the euro compared to the previous year.\n\nThe currencies of major emerging markets mostly depreciated against the euro.

On the other  hand,  the Brazilian  real  remained  largely  stable against the euro, depreciating by less than 1% on average.

The development of the most significant performance indicators is described in the respective chapters on the Automotive, Motorcycles,  and  Financial  Services  segments. An  explanation  of the development of other non -financial performance indicators is provided in the chapters on Products as well as Employees and Society.\n\n## BMW Group: Comparison of the forecast for 2023 with actual outcomes in 2023\n\n|                                                           | Forecast for 2023 in 2022  Group Report   | Forecast revision during  the year   |              | Actual outcome  in 2023               |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------|---------------------------------------|\n| GROUP                                                     |                                           |                                      |              |                                       |\n| Profit before tax                                         | Significant decrease                      |                                      | in \u20ac million | 17,069 (-27.3%)  Significant decrease |\n| Workforce at year-end                                     | Slight increase                           |                                      |              | 154,950 (+3.7%)  Slight increase      |\n| Share of women in management positions  in the BMW Group  | Slight increase                           |                                      | in %         | 20.8 (+3.0%)  Slight increase         |\n| AUTOMOTIVE SEGMENT                                        |                                           |                                      |              |                                       |\n| EBIT margin                                               | Between 8 and 10                          | Q2: 9 to 10.5                        | in %         | 9.8 (+1.2% points)                    |\n| Return on capital employed (RoCE)                         | Between 15 and 20                         | Q2: 18 to 22                         | in %         | 20.2 (+2.1% points)                   |\n| Deliveries                                                | Slight increase                           | Q2: solid increase                   | in units     | 2,554,183 (+6.4%)  Solid increase     |\n| Share of all-electric cars in deliveries                  | Significant increase                      |                                      | in %         | 14.7% (+63.3%)  Significant increase  |\n| CO\u2082 emissions EU new vehicle fleet 1,2,3                  | Slight reduction                          |                                      | in g/km      | 102.1 (-2.8%)  Slight reduction       |\n| CO\u2082 emissions BMW Group locations per vehicle  produced 4 | Slight reduction                          |                                      | in t         | 0.28 (-12.5%)  Significant reduction  |\n| MOTORCYCLES SEGMENT                                       |                                           |                                      |              |                                       |\n| EBIT margin                                               | Between 8 and 10                          |                                      | in %         | 8.1 (+0.0% points)                    |\n| Return on capital employed (RoCE)                         | Between 21 and 26                         |                                      | in %         | 22.1 (-2.8% points)                   |\n| Deliveries                                                | Slight increase                           |                                      | in units     | 209,066 (+3.3%)  Slight increase      |\n| FINANCIAL SERVICES SEGMENT                                |                                           |                                      |              |                                       |\n| Return on equity (RoE)                                    | Between 14 and 17                         | Q2: 16 to 19                         | in %         | 17.2 (-0.7% points)                   |\n\n- 1 EU-27 countries including Norway and Iceland; with effect from 2021, values are calculated on a converted basis in line with WLTP (Worldwide Harmonised Light Vehicles Test Procedure).\n- 2 This is a preliminary internal calculation with a potential variation of +/- 0.5 g CO2/km, as official registration figures from the authorities are not available for all EU states.

        "page_content": "## Solid increase in Group revenues\n\nWhen  comparing  figures  with  the  previous  financial  year,  it should be noted that BMW  Brilliance Automotive Ltd. (BMW Brilliance) has been  fully consolidated as a subsidiary since 11 February 2022, whereas up to that date, it had been accounted for using  the  equity  method.  Consequently,  BMW Brilliance  is  included for the whole of 2023, but only for a proportionate period of the previous year.\n\nFinancial Performance\n\nThese favourable factors were offset by unfavourable exchange rate effects from the Chinese renminbi and the US dollar which held down Group revenues.\n\nThe year-on-year increase in cost of sales reflected sales volume growth as well as higher expenses for materials and warranty obligations. Similarly, cost of sales recorded by BMW Brilliance also contributed to an increase compared to 2022. Cost of sales in  the  previous  financial  year were also additionally negatively impacted by the first-time full consolidation of BMW Brilliance. Rising interest rates increased interest expenses for the Financial Services segment.\n\nGroup  research  and  development  expenses  increased  significantly by 13.8% year on year. Research and development expenditure related primarily to the digitalisation and electrification of the vehicle fleet across all model series, as well as the development of automated driving functions. Further expenditure was incurred for the development of new models, such as the all- electric  BMW i5 * ,  the X3 and X5 and the Rolls-Royce Spectre and NEUE KLASSE models.\n\nGroup revenues totalled \u20ac 155,498 million in the reporting year (2022:  \u20ac 142,610 million),  representing  a  solid  increase  over the previous year (+9.0%). The main reason for revenue growth was the higher number of vehicles delivered. Furthermore, favourable product mix effects and the aforementioned full consolidation  of  BMW Brilliance  contributed  to  the  year-on-year  increase  in  revenues.  Additionally,  higher  interest  rates  and  income from  dealership  financing  further  increased  revenues  in 2023, mainly reflecting the impact of higher inventory levels held by  dealerships  in  light  of  improved  vehicle  availability,  model changes and a higher average financing volume per vehicle.\n\nReduced intersegment eliminations associated with leasing business had a positive impact on revenues.\n\nDue to revenue growth, the research and development expenditure ratio remained at the same level as one year earlier.\n\n## BMW Group cost of sales\n\n| in \u20ac million                                                       | 2023    | 2022    |   Change  in % |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|----------------|\n| Manufacturing costs                                                | 82,549  | 76,760  |            7.5 |\n| Cost of sales relating to financial services business              | 27,764  | 27,517  |            0.9 |\n| thereof interest expense relating to financial services business   | 3,554   | 2,114   |           68.1 |\n| Research and development expenses                                  | 7,538   | 6,624   |           13.8 |\n| thereof amortisation of capitalised development costs              | 2,387   | 2,265   |            5.4 |\n| Expenses for service contracts, telematics and roadside assistance | 2,780   | 2,775   |            0.2 |\n| Warranty expenditure                                               | 3,782   | 3,209   |           17.9 |\n| Other cost of sales                                                | 1,396   | 1,157   |           20.7 |\n| Cost of sales                                                      | 125,809 | 118,042 |            6.6 |\n\nSelling and administrative expenses went up slightly by 3.9% year  on  year.  The  rise  was  due  to  higher  administrative expenses, primarily influenced by higher costs for IT projects, notably in connection with the planned switch to direct sales in Europe. The ratio of selling and administrative expenses to revenues fell to 7.1% (2022: 7.4%).\n\nDepreciation and amortisation on property, plant and equipment and intangible assets recorded in cost of sales as well as in selling and administrative expenses totalled \u20ac 8,974 million (2022: \u20ac 8,566 million).\n\nThe net amount of other operating income and expenses deteriorated year on year. In 2022, other operating income was increased by income arising on the reversal of provisions.\n\nDue to the various factors  affecting  gross  profit,  as  described above, profit before financial result climbed to \u20ac 18,482 million (2022: \u20ac 13,999 million; +32.0%). The impact of the previous year's first-time full consolidation of BMW Brilliance and lower intersegment eliminations related to leasing business had a particularly positive  effect  on  the  year-on-year  change  in  gross profit.\n\nof\n\nThe financial result deteriorated significantly to a net negative amount of \u20ac 1,386 million (2022: net positive amount \u20ac 9,510 million). In the previous year, other financial result benefitted primarily from the gain of approximately \u20ac 7.7 billion arising  on  the  remeasurement  of  the  shares  already  held  by  the BMW Group prior to the business combination with BMW Brilliance.\n\nAdditionally, the other financial result was adversely impacted by the fair value measurement of interest rate hedging transactions, reflecting falling interest rates in the USA, the UK and the eurozone during the twelve-month period under report. In the previous  year,  the  increase  in  interest  rates  resulted  in  favourable measurement effects on interest rate hedging transactions.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The programme, with a volume of up to \u20ac 2 billion (total purchase price excluding incidental acquisition costs) pertains to common and preferred stock, the latter of which is limited to a maximum volume of \u20ac 350 million.\n\nThe first tranche of the second share buyback programme was successfully completed on 1 December 2023. As part of this first tranche,  a  total  of  4,218,363  shares  of  common  stock  and 942,892 shares of preferred stock were acquired between 3 July 2023 and 1 December 2023. A total purchase price (excluding incidental acquisition costs) of around \u20ac  500 million was paid for the shares repurchased as part of this tranche.\n\nThe second tranche of the second share buyback programme will be carried out with a volume of up to \u20ac 410 million for common stock and up to \u20ac 90 million for preferred stock in the period from 2 January 2024 to 28 June 2024, at the latest.\n\nThe second share buyback programme will be concluded by 31 December 2025, at the latest.\n\nAt  the  Annual  General  Meeting  of  BMW AG  held  on  11  May 2022, the shareholders authorised the Board of Management to acquire treasury shares via the stock exchange, up to a maximum of 10% of the share capital in place at the date of the resolution and to redeem those shares without any further action required by the Annual General Meeting. The buyback authorisation remains valid until 10 May 2027. In July 2022, on the basis of this authorisation, BMW AG resolved an initial share buyback programme, with a volume of up to \u20ac 2.0 billion (total purchase price excluding incidental acquisition costs), comprising up to \u20ac 1.85 billion for shares of common stock and up to \u20ac 0.15 billion for shares of preferred stock. The programme  was launched on 1 July 2022 and ended on 30 June 2023. BMW AG repurchased a total of 22,199,529 shares of common stock for \u20ac 1,850  million  and  1,923,871  shares  of  preferred  stock  for \u20ac 150 million. On 18 July 2023, the Board of Management resolved to redeem all of the shares repurchased in conjunction with the initial buyback programme. The process of redeeming the shares was completed during the third quarter 2023.\n\nSimilarly, the net interest result deteriorated year on year. In the previous  year,  interest  and  similar  expenses  included  income arising  on  the  change  in  interest  rates  in  connection  with  the measurement of provisions. By contrast, falling interest rates in 2023 had a negative impact.\n\nAccordingly, Group profit before tax amounting to \u20ac 17,096 million - as forecast - was significantly lower than one year earlier (2022: \u20ac 23,509 million).\n\nAt \u20ac 4,931 million (2022: \u20ac 4,927 million; +0.1%), income tax expense in the reporting year was at a similar level to the previous year.\n\nThe effective tax rate was 28.8% (2022: 21.0%). In the previous financial year, the primary factor reducing the effective tax rate was the tax-neutral gain resulting from the remeasurement of the shares held prior to the business combination with BMW  Brilliance.\n\nIn the reporting year, the size of the workforce was slightly higher at  154,950  employees,  which  was  in  line  with  expectations (2022: 149,475 employees; +3.7%).\n\n<!-- image -->",

Cash and cash equivalents in the cash flow statements correspond to the amounts disclosed in the balance sheet.\n\nCash flows from operating  activities  are  determined  indirectly, starting with Group/segment profit before tax. By contrast, cash flows from investing and financing activities are based on actual payments and receipts.\n\nThe lower net cash inflow from operating activities was primarily due to changes in leased products and receivables from sales financing, particularly credit financing for dealerships. The yearon-year increase in credit financing for dealerships was driven by improved vehicle availability, model changes and a higher average financing volume per vehicle.\n\nA further factor for the decrease in cash inflow from operating activities was the higher level of inventories held with a view to servicing  markets  and  fulfilling  customer  demand.  A  lower  increase in receivables and higher payables had a positive impact on the cash inflow from operating activities.\n\nThe cash outflow from investing activities was higher than one year earlier. In 2022, the first -time full consolidation of BMW  Brilliance resulted in a positive impact of \u20ac  3,587 million to cash outflow from investing activities, resulting from cash acquired on the business combination and the purchase price paid. Moreover, increased investments in property, plant and equipment, particularly for introducing new vehicle models, digitalising the fleet as well as pressing ahead with automated driving and the NEUE KLASSE, resulted in a higher net cash outflow than one year earlier.\n\nIn contrast, the net cash inflow arising on the sale of marketable securities  had  a  positive  impact  on  cash  flows  from  investing activities.\n\nThe decrease in the net cash outflow from financing activities was  mainly  the  result  of  higher  borrowings  and  lower  repayments.\n\nHigher dividend payments to shareholders of BMW AG (2023: \u20ac 5,430 million; 2022: \u20ac 3,827 million) increased the net cash outflow from financing activities.\n\n## BMW Group cash flows\n\n| in \u20ac million                                                   | 2023    | 2022     | Change   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------|---------|----------|----------|\n| Cash inflow (+) / outflow (-) from operating activities        | 17,542  | 23,523   | - 5,981  |\n| Cash inflow (+) / outflow (-) from investing activities        | - 9,548 | - 4,772  | - 4,776  |\n| Cash inflow (+) / outflow (-) from financing activities        | - 6,859 | - 17,984 | 11,125   |\n| Effects of exchange rate and changes in composition of segment | - 678   | 94       | - 772    |\n| Change in cash and cash equivalents                            | 457     | 861      | - 404    |\n\nFree cash flow for the Automotive segment was as follows:\n\n## Free cash flow Automotive segment\n\n| in \u20ac million                                                                | 2023    | 2022    | Change   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|----------|\n| Cash inflow (+) / outflow (-) from operating activities                     | 17,675  | 14,782  | 2,893    |\n| Cash inflow (+) / outflow (-) from investing activities                     | - 9,373 | - 3,179 | - 6,194  |\n| Adjustment for net investment in marketable securities and investment funds | - 1,360 | - 532   | - 828    |\n| Free cash flow Automotive segment                                           | 6,942   | 11,071  | - 4,129  |",

        "page_content": "Financial Performance\n\nThe Automotive segment generated a free cash flow in 2023 totalling \u20ac 6,942 million.\n\nThe main factor for the year-on-year decrease was the net cash outflow from investing activities, which, in 2022, had included a positive impact of \u20ac 5,011 million in connection with the full consolidation  of  BMW Brilliance.  Excluding  that  impact,  the  segment's free cash flow would have amounted to \u20ac 6,060 million in 2022.\n\nAutomotive  segment  cash  inflow  from  operating  activities  improved year on year, with the change in trade receivables and trade payables contributing to the increase. In contrast, the build up of inventories to service the markets had a negative impact. Liabilities for bonus payments to dealerships went up, partly due to the higher sales volume, and had a  positive impact on the cash flow. In addition, the net cash inflow from operating activities rose due to lower income tax payments.\n\nNet financial assets of the Automotive segment decreased year on year due to dividend payments and the share buyback programme.\n\nIn the Automotive segment, net financial assets comprised the following:\n\n## Net financial assets Automotive segment\n\n| in \u20ac million                               | 2023    | 2022    | Change   |\n|--------------------------------------------|---------|---------|----------|\n| Cash and cash equivalents                  | 13,590  | 13,109  | 481      |\n| Marketable securities and investment funds | 1,782   | 3,031   | - 1,249  |\n| Intercompany net financial assets          | 4,406   | 11,197  | - 6,791  |\n| Financial assets                           | 19,778  | 27,337  | - 7,559  |\n| Less: external financial liabilities*      | - 2,775 | - 2,734 | - 41     |\n| Net financial assets Automotive segment    | 17,003  | 24,603  | - 7,600  |\n\n* Excluding derivative financial instruments.\n\nCash and cash equivalents held by the Financial Services segment changed as follows:\n\n## Cash flows Financial Services segment\n\n| in \u20ac million                                                   | 2023   | 2022    | Change   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------|--------|---------|----------|\n| Cash inflow (+) / outflow (-) from operating activities        | 488    | 9,145   | - 8,657  |\n| Cash inflow (+) / outflow (-) from investing activities        | 6      | - 50    | 56       |\n| Cash inflow (+) / outflow (-) from financing activities        | - 750  | - 9,042 | 8,292    |\n| Effects of exchange rate and changes in composition of segment | - 184  | 6       | - 190    |\n| Change in cash and cash equivalents                            | - 440  | 59      | - 499    |\n\nThe lower cash inflow from operating activities of the Financial Services segment was primarily due to changes in leased products and receivables from sales financing, particularly credit financing for dealerships. The year-on-year increase in credit financing for dealerships was driven by improved vehicle availability, model changes, and a higher average financing volume per vehicle.\n\nThe change in the net cash outflow from financing activities was attributable  to  lower  cash  outflows  relating  to  intragroup  refinancing on the one hand and the decreased repayment of external financial liabilities on the other.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## FINANCING ACTIVITIES\n\nA broad range of instruments on international money and capital markets  is  used  to  finance  worldwide  operations.  The  funds raised are used almost exclusively to refinance the BMW  Group's Financial  Services  business.  The  overall  objective  of  Group  financing is to ensure the solvency of the BMW Group at all times, focusing on three areas:\n\n- 1.  The ability to act through permanent access to strategically important capital markets\n- 2.  Autonomy through the diversification  of  refinancing  instruments and investors\n- 3.  A focus on value through the optimisation of financing costs\n\nFinancing  measures undertaken at corporate level ensure access to liquidity for the Group's operating subsidiaries at standard market conditions and consistent credit terms. Funds are acquired in line with a target liability structure, comprising a balanced mix of financing instruments. The use of longer-term instruments to refinance the Group's Financial Services business and the maintenance of a sufficiently high liquidity reserve serves to rule out any imminent liquidity risk for the portfolio. This conservative financial approach also has a favourable effect on the Group's  rating.  Further  information  is  provided  in  the  section Liquidity Risks within the chapter \u2197 Risks and Opportunities .\n\nFocused capital market management, good ratings and the high level of acceptance enjoyed by the BMW  Group on those markets enabled it to refinance itself on the world's debt capital markets at favourable conditions during the 12-month period under report. In addition to bonds, the BMW Group also issued commercial paper.\n\nFinancial Performance\n\nFurthermore,  retail  customer  and  dealership  financing  receivables, rights and obligations from leasing contracts, as well as collateral interests in the financed vehicles, were transferred to structured entities that securitise them and place them as collateralised securities on the capital market as part of the Group's asset-backed  securities  financing  arrangements  (ABS  financing).\n\nThe following table provides an overview of amounts utilised at 31 December 2023 in connection with the BMW  Group's money and capital market programmes:\n\n| Programmes             | Programme  volume   | Amount  utilised *   |\n|------------------------|---------------------|----------------------|\n| in \u20ac billion           |                     |                      |\n| Euro medium-term notes | 50.0                | 22.9                 |\n| Commercial paper       | 13.0                | 3.3                  |\n\n* Measured at the year-end exchange rate.\n\nThe  BMW Group  continued  to  deploy  robust  liquidity-related measures throughout 2023 to ensure its ability to act flexibly and independently at all times.\n\nSpecific  banking  instruments,  such  as  the  customer  deposits used by the Group's own banks in Germany and the USA, were also  deployed  for  financing  purposes.  In  addition,  loans  were taken from international banks.\n\nDuring the reporting period, the BMW Group issued bonds totalling approximately \u20ac 9.2 billion. The Group refinanced itself by means of 144A transactions with a total volume of 3 billion US dollars  on  the  US  capital  market  and  by  means  of  so-called Panda bonds with a volume of 3 billion Chinese renminbi on the Chinese  capital  market.  Furthermore,  the  BMW Group  issued, among others, two euro benchmark bonds totalling \u20ac 3.0 billion, as well as a pound sterling benchmark bond of 0.4 billion British pounds and a Canadian bond of 0.5 billion Canadian dollars on the international capital markets. ABS transactions with a total financing volume equivalent to \u20ac 16.0 billion were executed in 2023,  including  both  new  and  rolled-over  ABS  transactions. During  the  reporting  period,  ABS  financing  transactions  were carried out in the following markets: Australia, China, Germany, Japan, Canada, Switzerland, South Korea, the USA and the UK.\n\nAs at 31 December 2023, liquidity on hand amounted to \u20ac 19.5 billion, slightly below the previous year's level (2022: \u20ac 20.3 billion).\n\nThe  BMW Group  also  has  access  to  a  syndicated  credit  line, which  was  renewed  in  June  2023.  The  syndicated  credit  line amounting to \u20ac 8 billion has a term without exercising extension options until June 2028 and is provided by a consortium of 43 international banks.\n\nThe credit line was not being utilised at 31 December 2023. Further information with respect to financial liabilities is provided in \u2197 note 36 to the Group Financial Statements.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Currency effects from the Chinese renminbi and the US dollar had a dampening effect on the balance sheet total. 1\n\nIntangible assets decreased moderately  compared to 31 December 2022 on a currency-adjusted basis. The main reason for the decrease was the amortisation recognised on reacquired rights  and  dealership  relationships  from  the  acquisition  of BMW Brilliance.\n\nAdjusted for currency effects, property, plant and equipment was up by 12.2% year on year. This increase was driven in particular by additions to land, buildings and production facilities of the newly fully consolidated entity, BMW Manufacturing Hungary Kft. Higher investments in the sixth generation of electric drives, as well as for new vehicle projects such as the new BMW 5 Series, also had an impact. The capital expenditure ratio stood at 5.7% (2022:  5.5%)  whereas  the  capital  expenditure  ratio  excluding right-of-use assets increased to 4.9% (2022: 4.3%).\n\nLeased products were slightly up on a currency-adjusted basis. The increase was driven by the higher level of new leasing business and a higher average financing volume. In contrast, the managed contract portfolio decreased to 1,712,330 contracts (2022: 1,807,904 contracts; -5.3%).\n\nReceivables from sales financing increased slightly compared to 31. Dezember 2022 on a currency-adjusted basis. An increase in dealership financing, especially in the USA and Germany, had an impact at 31 December 2023. The year-on-year increase in dealership financing was due to better availability of vehicles, the introduction of new models such as the BMW 7 Series and the BMW i5\u00b2, and a higher average financing volume per vehicle. The increase was offset by a decrease in customer financing, particularly in China. The decrease in China was due to strong  competition from local banks.",

The  dividend payout amounting  to \u20ac 5,430 million  reduced Group  equity  and,  to  an  equal  extent,  equity attributable  to BMW AG  shareholders.  The  continued  share  buy-back programme also reduced equity attributable to shareholders of the BMW Group.\n\nPension obligations stood at \u20ac 427 million, surpassing the previous year's figure of \u20ac 339 million. The increase in the provision for pensions resulted mainly from the application of lower discount rates.\n\nOther provisions increased significantly on a currency-adjusted basis, largely due to higher provisions for statutory and non -statutory warranty obligations, as well as product guarantees.\n\nCurrency-adjusted financial liabilities went up, primarily due to increased volume of ABS financing and higher liabilities from customer deposits. These increases took place against the backdrop of rising financing requirements in light of the growth of Financial Services business.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Depreciation and amortisation, cost of materials, and other  expenses  are treated  as  bought-in  costs  in  the  net value added calculation. The allocation statement applies value added to each of the participants involved in the value added process. The bulk of the net value added benefits the employees. The remaining portion in the Group is retained to finance future operations. The gross value added amount treats depreciation and amortisation as a component of value added which, in the allocation statement, would be treated as internal financing.\n\nNet value added by the BMW Group declined in 2023 due to lower earnings compared to the previous year.\n\n## BMW Group value added statement\n\n|                                                                                     | 2023  in \u20ac million   | 2023  in %   | 2022  in \u20ac million   | 2022  in %   | Change  in %   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|--------------|----------------------|--------------|----------------|\n| WORK PERFORMED                                                                      |                      |              |                      |              |                |\n| Revenues                                                                            | 155,498              | 100.1        | 142,610              | 92.7         | 9.0            |\n| Financial income                                                                    | - 1,227              | - 0.8        | 9,783                | 6.4          | -              |\n| Other income                                                                        | 1,045                | 0.7          | 1,377                | 0.9          | - 24.1         |\n| Total output                                                                        | 155,316              | 100.0        | 153,770              | 100.0        | 1.0            |\n| Cost of materials*                                                                  | 82,527               | 53.1         | 80,181               | 52.1         | 2.9            |\n| Other expenses                                                                      | 22,609               | 14.6         | 19,479               | 12.7         | 16.1           |\n| Bought\u00adin costs                                                                      | 105,136              | 67.7         | 99,660               | 64.9         | 5.5            |\n| Gross value added                                                                   | 50,180               | 32.3         | 54,110               | 35.2         | - 7.3          |\n| Depreciation and amortisation of total tangible,  intangible and investment  assets | 14,565               | 9.4          | 14,456               | 9.4          | 0.8            |\n| Net value added                                                                     | 35,615               | 22.9         | 39,654               | 25.8         | - 10.2         |\n| ALLOCATION                                                                          |                      |              |                      |              |                |\n| Employees                                                                           | 14,721               | 41.3         | 13,932               | 35.1         | 5.7            |\n| Providers of finance                                                                | 3,665                | 10.3         | 2,274                | 5.7          | 61.2           |\n| Government/public sector                                                            | 5,064                | 14.2         | 4,866                | 12.3         | 4.1            |\n| Shareholders                                                                        | 3,802                | 10.7         | 5,480                | 13.8         | - 30.6         |\n| Group                                                                               | 7,488                | 21.0         | 12,461               | 31.4         | - 39.9         |\n| Non-controlling interests                                                           | 875                  | 2.5          | 641                  | 1.6          | -              |\n| Net value added                                                                     | 35,615               | 100.0        | 39,654               | 100.0        | - 10.2         |\n\n- * Cost of materials comprises all primary material costs incurred for vehicle production plus ancillary material costs (such as customs duties, insurance premiums and freight).\n\n<!-- image -->",

Customers worldwide responded positively to the appealing and contemporary product portfolios of the BMW, MINI and Rolls-Royce brands. The BMW Group offers a diverse range of drive systems, encompassing all- electric models (BEV), state-of-the-art plug-in hybrids (PHEV) and highly efficient combustion engines, to meet a wide range of customer requirements. The ramp-up of electric mobility was also a significant driver of growth in 2023.\n\nThe share of all -electric vehicles in deliveries increased to 14.7% in 2023 (2022: 9.0%; +63.3%). The significant increase also had a positive effect on the development of fleet carbon emissions. \u2197 Carbon Emissions\n\nThe success of the BMW i4 4 and BMW iX1 4 models had a major impact on sales growth. The BMW iX3 4 and the BMW iX 4 also continued to enjoy great popularity. Furthermore, electrification made its debut in its top  model series in the form of the BMW i7 4 Luxury  Sedan.  The  new  BMW i5 4 Business  Sedan  was  also added to the range of all-electric automobiles. This means that the BMW Group now has an all-electric model in each of its core segments.\n\n## BMW Group deliveries of electrified models\n\nIn  total,  during  the  reporting  year,  the  BMW  Group  delivered 2,554,183 automobiles across the BMW, MINI and Rolls-Royce brands, setting a new record high. In line with expectations, a solid year-on-year increase in deliveries 1 was therefore achieved in the reporting year (2022: 2,399,632 2 units; +6.4%).\n\nThe  BMW  brand  set  a  new  record  with  deliveries  totalling 2,252,793 units (2022: 2,100,689 2 units; +7.2%). MINI delivered 295,358 units, similar to one year earlier (2022: 292,922 units; +0.8%). Rolls-Royce, the renowned luxury marque, delivered  6,032  units  to  customers,  achieving  a  new  all-time  high (2022: 6,021 units; +0.2%).\n\n## Electric mobility maintains momentum\n\nThe BMW Group's sales growth in the reporting year was significantly influenced by the systematic electrification of its product range. This was borne out by continued strong growth in deliveries of all-electric vehicles. Market demand for all- electric vehicles from the BMW, MINI and Rolls-Royce brands resulted in deliveries  rising  to  375,716  units  (2022:  215,752 3 units;  +74.1%). Overall, the BMW Group delivered more than half a million electrified vehicles (BEV and PHEV) to customers for the first time with a total of 565,875 units (2022: 433,792 3 units; +30.4%).\n\n| in units         | 2023    | 2022    | Change  in %    |\n|------------------|---------|---------|-----------------|\n| BEV              | 215,752 |         | 375,716  74.1   |\n|                  | 172,008 | 92.0    | BMW  330,197    |\n|                  | 43,744  | 3.3     | MINI  45,193    |\n| Rolls-Royce  326 | -       | -       |                 |\n| PHEV             | 218,040 |         | 190,159  - 12.8 |\n| 173,878          | 200,945 | - 13.5  | BMW             |\n| 16,281           | 17,095  | - 4.8   | MINI            |\n| Total 3          | 565,875 | 433,792 | 30.4            |",

All key regions contributed to growth. Vehicle sales in Europe totalled 942,958 units  (2022: 878,515 units; +7.3%). Solid growth was also recorded  in Germany,  where  deliveries  totalled  272,589  units (2022: 254,292 units; +7.2%). In the UK, sales rose to 159,202 units (2022: 157,329 units; +1.2%). Significant growth was recorded in France, with sales up to 86,606 units (2022: 75,805 units; +14.2%), while Italy also saw strong growth with 78,763 units delivered (2022: 67,025 units; +17.5%).\n\nIn  the  Americas,  the  BMW  Group  recorded  solid  growth,  with sales up to 482,048 units (2022: 441,471 units; +9.2%). The positive trend also continued in the USA, with deliveries up by 9.3% to 397,325 units (2022: 363,541 units).\n\nSales markets in Asia recovered slightly from the downturns that had arisen in the previous year due to general pandemic-related restrictions. In the reporting year, deliveries in this region totalled 1,073,115 units (2022: 1,030,987 1 units; +4.1%). The sales situation  in  China  also  improved,  with  deliveries  up  slightly  by 4.1% to 826,257 units (2022: 793,520 1 units).\n\n## BMW retains top spot in global premium segment\n\nThe  core  BMW  brand  set  a  new  sales  record  in  2023  with 2,252,793  units  (2022:  2,100,689 1 units;  +7.2%)  delivered. This performance confirms the brand's top position in the global premium segment. The key driver of growth was sales of all- electric  models,  which  nearly  doubled  in  2023  to  330,197  units (2022: 172,008 2 units; +92.0%). Models from the X family, especially the BMW X1, continued to enjoy great popularity. Almost every fifth vehicle (19%) of this highly successful model was sold in the all-electric BMW iX1 3 version.\n\n## BMW Group deliveries of vehicles by region and market\n\n| in 1,000 units   | 2023    | 2022    | 2021    | 2020    | 2019    |\n|------------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|\n| Europe           | 943.0   | 878.5   | 949.1   | 913.6   | 1,081.6 |\n| thereof Germany  | 272.6   | 254.3   | 266.8   | 285.0   | 330.5   |\n| thereof UK       | 159.2   | 157.3   | 164.3   | 163.2   | 233.8   |\n| Americas         | 482.0   | 441.5   | 451.7   | 379.7   | 472.9   |\n| thereof USA      | 397.3   | 363.5   | 368.0   | 307.9   | 375.7   |\n| Asia 1           | 1,073.1 | 1,031.0 | 1,067.9 | 986.5   | 930.8   |\n| thereof China 1  | 826.3   | 793.5   | 847.9   | 778.4   | 724.7   |\n| Other markets    | 56.1    | 48.6    | 52.8    | 45.4    | 52.2    |\n| Total 1          | 2,554.2 | 2,399.6 | 2,521.5 | 2,325.2 | 2,537.5 |\n\n- 1 Deliveries including BMW Brilliance Automotive Ltd., also for the period prior to that entity's full consolidation in the Group Financial Statements of the BMW Group (1 January to 10 February 2022: 96,133 units, 2021: 651,236 units, 2020: 602,247 units, 2019: 538,612 units).\n- 2 Including BMW Brilliance Automotive Ltd., also for the period before full consolidation in the BMW Group Financial Statements.\n- 3 \u2197 Consumption and Carbon Disclosures.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## BMW Group - largest automobile markets in 2023\n\n<!-- image -->",

The new BMW X5 and BMW X6 flagship models were launched in the spring. The new BMW 5 Series Sedan followed in autumn. At market launch, all drivetrain variants were available for this model, including the first all-electric BMW i5 1 , the two PHEV models BMW 530e 1 and BMW 550e xDrive 1 , as well as models powered by conventional combustion engines. The globally popular Business Sedan, which received an overwhelmingly positive response from the international trade press  shortly  after  its  launch,  will  be  available  on  the  Chinese market from early 2024. In October 2023, the BMW X2 also celebrated  its  world  premiere  with  its  first  all-electric  BMW  iX2 1 model. The market launch will start in spring 2024.\n\n## BMW M sets new record\n\nBMW M is also on course for growth. With a significant increase of 14.2% to a total of 202,431 units, sales of high-performance automobiles  surpassed  the  200,000-mark  for  the  first  time (2022: 177,258 units). The positive development is also a result of the electrification of the BMW M model range: the highest-volume model was once again the Sports Coup\u00e9 BMW i4 M50 1 .\n\nThe focus on the electrification of drive systems was also evident in market launches in 2023. Right at the beginning of the year, the BMW XM 1 was launched worldwide as BMW M's first highperformance class PHEV. The BMW i7 M70 xDrive 1 and BMW i5 M60 xDrive 1 models expanded the BMW M portfolio of all-electric high-performance vehicles.\n\n## Deliveries of BMW vehicles by model series 2\n\n| in units                  | 2023      | 2022      | Change in %   | Share of BMW  deliveries 2023 in %   |\n|---------------------------|-----------|-----------|---------------|--------------------------------------|\n| BMW 1 Series/BMW 2 Series | 225,827   | 205,971   | 9.6           | 10.0                                 |\n| BMW 3 Series/BMW 4 Series | 558,462   | 478,932   | 16.6          | 24.8                                 |\n| BMW 5 Series/BMW 6 Series | 273,877   | 315,590   | - 13.2        | 12.2                                 |\n| BMW 7 Series/BMW 8 Series | 59,763    | 48,708    | 22.7          | 2.7                                  |\n| BMW Z4                    | 10,957    | 12,029    | - 8.9         | 0.5                                  |\n| BMW X1/X2                 | 318,051   | 242,189   | 31.3          | 14.1                                 |\n| BMW X3/X4                 | 405,562   | 400,898   | 1.2           | 18.0                                 |\n| BMW X5/X6                 | 280,684   | 277,057   | 1.3           | 12.5                                 |\n| BMW X7                    | 61,117    | 57,905    | 5.5           | 2.7                                  |\n| BMW iX                    | 50,989    | 39,130    | 30.3          | 2.3                                  |\n| BMW XM                    | 6,749     | -         | -             | 0.3                                  |\n| BMW i3/i8                 | 755       | 22,280    | - 96.6        | -                                    |\n| BMW total                 | 2,252,793 | 2,100,689 | 7.2           | 100.0                                |\n| thereof BEV               | 330,197   | 172,008   | 92.0          | 14.7                                 |\n| thereof PHEV              | 173,878   | 200,945   | - 13.5        | 7.7                                  |\n\nThe 2024 model year looks highly promising.

Electrification also had a highly perceptible impact in the premium compact segment, with the MINI Cooper SE * once again finishing the year as the brand's best-selling model. The MINI Cooper SE Convertible * was also launched during the reporting year, providing electrified driving pleasure in combination with an open-air experience. The limited edition of 999 vehicles was quickly sold out.

        "page_content": "Financial Performance\n\n## Automotive segment earnings performance in line with expectations\n\nAs in the analysis of the Group's earnings performance, it should be noted that BMW Brilliance has been fully consolidated since 11 February 2022, and therefore for only part of the financial year 2022. In 2023, it has been included for the full year.\n\nAt  \u20ac 132,277 million  (2022:  \u20ac 123,602 million;  +7.0%,  currency-adjusted: +11.3%), the Automotive segment recorded a solid year-on-year increase in revenues on the back of higher vehicle sales. In the previous year, vehicle sales fell due to production cutbacks caused by the limited availability of semiconductors and wiring harnesses as well as pandemic-related lockdowns in China. Furthermore, the increased volume of high-revenue models sold, such as the BMW 7 Series and the BMW X5, as well as growth in spare parts and accessories business, also contributed to the year-on-year increase in revenues. The full consolidation of  BMW Brilliance also increased revenues. Unfavourable currency translation effects, primarily from the Chinese renminbi and the US dollar, held down the increase in revenues.\n\nThe segment's cost of sales amounted to \u20ac  109,920 million and was therefore moderately higher than the previous year (2022: \u20ac 104,324 million;  +5.4%).  Similar  to  revenue,  higher  vehicle sales and full consolidation of BMW  Brilliance also had an impact in this regard. The segment's cost of sales was also negatively impacted by increased expenses for warranties. A higher proportion of electrified, especially all-electric, vehicles also contributed to increased costs.\n\nIn the  previous  year,  the  impact  of  the  full  consolidation  of BMW Brilliance, including approximately \u20ac 1.8 billion in depreciation from purchase price allocation and the elimination of approximately \u20ac 1.3 billion in intra-group profits, had a negative effect on the cost of sales. Depreciation from the purchase price allocation amounted to approximately \u20ac 1.4 billion in 2023.\n\nThe increased research and development expenditure  is primarily related to the cross-series digitalisation and electrification of the vehicle fleet, as well as the development of automated dr iving functions. Furthermore, the expenditure resulted from\n\ndevelopment  of  new  models,  such  as  the  BMW 5  Series  and NEUE KLASSE models, for example.\n\nSelling and administrative expenses rose to \u20ac 9,195 million in the reporting period (2022: \u20ac 8,801 million; +4.5%). A significant reason for the increase is higher costs for IT projects.\n\nThe net amount of other operating income and expenses decreased year-on-year. Among other factors, other operating income in the previous year included higher reversals of provisions.\n\nAt \u20ac 12,981 million, profit before financial result in the 2023 financial year was significantly higher than in the same period of the  previous  year  (2022: \u20ac 10,635 million;  +22.1%).  The  full consolidation  of  BMW Brilliance  had  a  dampening  impact  in 2022 in the year-on-year comparison.\n\nThe EBIT margin for the segment was at 9.8% for the reporting year (2022: 8.6%; +1.2 percentage points). As forecasted in the quarterly report for 30 September 2023, the EBIT margin was within the range of 9.0 to 10.5%.\n\nThe financial result of the Automotive segment was a net negative amount of \u20ac 339 million and therefore significantly down on the  previous  year's  corresponding  figure  (2022:  net  positive\n\namount of \u20ac 8,283 million). The main reason for the year-onyear  deterioration  was  the  gain  of  \u20ac 7.7  billion  recognised  in 2022 in other financial result arising on the remeasurement of the segment's previous at-equity interest in BMW Brilliance.\n\nIn  the  year  under  report,  the  interest  result  was  primarily  impacted by higher expenses arising from the unwinding of interest on discounted provisions, while interest income from bank deposits had an offsetting effect. In the previous year, interest income arising from the change in interest rates in connection with the unwinding of interest on discounted provisions was reported within interest and similar expenses.\n\nAt \u20ac 12,642 million, profit before tax for the financial year 2023 was significantly down on the previous year \u20ac 18,918 million),  whereby  the  decrease  was  primarily  due  to the  gain  of  \u20ac 7.7  billion  recognised  in  other  financial  result  in 2022 arising on the remeasurement of the segment's previous at-equity interest in BMW Brilliance.\n\nThe Automotive segment's return on capital employed (RoCE) for 2023 finished at 20.2%, and was therefore within the predicted target range of 18 to 22% (2022: 18.1%; +2.1 percentage points). The improvement was primarily due to the higher profit before financial result.\n\n## BMW Group margins by segment\n\n| in %                  | 2023   | 2022      | Change  in % points   |\n|-----------------------|--------|-----------|-----------------------|\n| AUTOMOTIVE            |        |           |                       |\n| Gross profit margin   | 16.9   | 15.6  1.3 | 1                     |\n| EBIT margin 2         | 9.8    | 8.6       | 1.2                   |\n| MOTORCYCLES           |        |           |                       |\n| Gross profit margin 1 | 17.4   | 17.3      | 0.1                   |\n| EBIT margin 2         | 8.1    | 8.1       | -                     |\n\n- 1 Gross profit as a percentage of segment revenues.\n\nthe\n\n- 2 Profit before financial result as a percentage of segment revenues.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n(",

This represents a slight increase of 3.0%, in line expectations for the financial year.\n\n## Sales growth in all key regions\n\nAll major regions worldwide contributed to the successful sales result in 2023. In Europe, deliveries increased slightly 116,011  units  (2022:  110,788  units;  +4.7%).  Germany  remained at the previous  year's  level  with  24,176  units  (2022: 24,129 units; +0.2%).

The BMW R 1300 GS was introduced as the highlight and start of the renewal of the legendary GS Boxer family and has been available to customers since November 2023.\n\nto (2022: In the first half of the year, three model updates were introduced in the Sport and Super Sport segment with the R 1250 RS, the S 1000 RR and their high-performance M variant - the M 1000 RR. The R 1250 R was updated within the Roadster lineup. The M 1000 R, the first M Roadster, took to the roads as a completely new model. The centenary celebrations were complemented in the Heritage segment by two exclusive edition models: the BMW R 18 100 Years and the BMW R nineT 100 Years. Another  highlight of the year was the opening of BMW  Motorrad Welt in Berlin as the 'Home of the Brand'. Fans and other interested parties can enjoy a world of experience centred around the BMW Motorrad brand.\n\n## Deliveries of BMW motorcycles\n\nin 1,000 units\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## BMW Group -largest motorcycle markets 2023\n\nin % of sales\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## New products unveiled by BMW Motorrad\n\nFor BMW Motorrad, the 2023 reporting year was dominated by the centenary celebrations. Four new models and four model updates were presented for market launches in 2024. BMW  Motorrad presented the new BMW CE 02 at the BMW Motorrad Days in  July  2023.  One  year  after  the  launch  of  the  BMW CE  04, BMW Motorrad  announced  a  further  electric  vehicle  for  urban centres and is systematically pursuing its electric mobility strategy.

        "page_content": "## Motorcycles segment earnings performance within target forecast\n\nThe EBIT margin of the Motorcycles segment came in at 8.1% (2022: 8.1%) and therefore within the forecast target range of 8 to 10%.\n\nAt \u20ac 258 million, profit before tax in the financial year 2023 was down slightly (2022: \u20ac 269 million; - 4.1%), whereby sales volume growth and positive pricing effects were offset by unfavourable product mix effects and higher material costs. In a year-onyear comparison, net interest expense of \u20ac  1 million in 2023 had a negative impact on the financial result (2022: net interest income of \u20ac 12 million). In the previous year, interest income arising from the change in interest rates in connection with the unwinding of interest on discounted provisions was reported within interest  and  similar  expenses.  In  contrast,  decreasing  interest rates had a negative impact in 2023.\n\nThe return on capital employed (RoCE) in the Motorcycles segment for the reporting year came in at 22.1%, and was therefore within the expected target range of 21 to 26% (2022: 24.9%; 2.8 percentage points). The primary factor for the year-on-year change was the rise in net working capital, driven by a number of factors, including the model update in 2023 and a moderate increase in inventory levels.\n\n## FINANCIAL SERVICES SEGMENT\n\n## Financial Services segment earnings down on previous year\n\nProfit before tax reported by the Financial Services segment for the  financial  year  2023  amounted  to  \u20ac 2,962  million  (2022: \u20ac 3,205 million; -7.6%) and was therefore moderately down on the previous year. Key reasons for the decrease were higher refinancing costs due to rising interest rates and a decrease in the contract portfolio. Remarketing revenues from lease returns remained at a high level, but were nevertheless below the previous year's figure. This also had a negative impact on earnings compared to the previous year. On the other hand, a lower expense for credit risk provisioning had a positive effect on earnings. In the previous year, the level of expense recognised in connection with credit risk provisioning was heavily influenced by geopolitical uncertainties and a weaker macroeconomic outlook.\n\nThe credit loss ratio for the entire credit portfolio remained at a low level in 2023, finishing at 0.18% for the year (2022: 0.13%). In  balance  sheet  terms,  business  volume  increased  slightly  to stand at \u20ac 137,910 million (2022: \u20ac 135,689 million; +1.6%).\n\n## Stable earnings performance by Financial Services segment\n\nReturn on equity for the Financial Services segment remained at a similar level to the previous year, finishing at 17.2% for the financial year 2023 (2022: 17.9%; -0.7 percentage points). Return on equity for 2023 was therefore within the revised target range of between 16 and 19%.\n\n## New business with retail customers in line with last year's level\n\nCredit financing and leasing business with retail customers remained at the same level in 2013, with a total of 1,542,514 new contracts concluded (2022: 1,545,490 contracts;  -0.2%). Out of the new contracts concluded in 2023, 325,320 contracts (2022: 321,535 contracts; +1.2%) related to credit financing and leasing of pre-owned BMW Group vehicles.\n\nNew lease business grew by 8.5% increase in 2023, whereas credit financing business contracted by 4.1%.  Leasing  accounted  for  33.6%  of  total  new  business,  credit  financing  for 66.4%.\n\nThe total volume new credit financing and leasing contracts with retail customers  rose  by  3.4%  to  \u20ac 57,333 million (2022: \u20ac 55,449 million), mainly due to a higher average financing volume per vehicle as a result of an improved product mix in the Automotive segment.\n\nThe share of new BMW Group vehicles either leased or financed by  the  Financial  Services  segment  stood  at  38.2% * in  2023 (2022: 41.0%; -2.8 percentage points).\n\n## New BMW Group vehicles leased or financed by the Financial Services segment *\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Out of the total portfolio of credit financing and leasing contracts with retail customers, this line of business accounted for 720,094 contracts at the end of the reporting period (31 December 2022: 714,630 contracts 2; +0.8%).\n\n## Dealership financing up on previous year\n\nAt 31 December 2023, the total business volume of dealership financing stood at \u20ac 18,941 million, up sharply compared to the end  of  the  previous  financial  year  (2022:  \u20ac 15,209  million; +24.5%).  The  increase  was  mainly  due  to  improved  vehicle availability, model changes and a higher average financing volume per vehicle.\n\n## OTHER ENTITIES SEGMENT / ELIMINATIONS\n\nThe Other Entities segment recorded a loss before of  \u20ac 100 million (2022: profit before tax  of \u20ac 995 million). The main  reason  for  the  deterioration  was  the  level  of  fair  value measurement losses recognised on interest rate hedging transactions in the line item 'Other financial result' as a result of falling interest rates in the USA, the UK and the eurozone during the reporting year. In the previous year, sharply rising interest rates led  to  fair  value  measurement  gains  on  interest  rate  hedging transactions reported by the Other Entities segment.\n\nAt the level of profit before tax, eliminations increased to a positive amount of \u20ac 1,334 million (2022: \u20ac 122 million). In comparison to the previous year, lower eliminations in 2023 for leasing and credit financing business had a positive impact on the result reported.\n\nta",

        "page_content": "Financial Performance\n\n## COMMENTS ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF BMW AG\n\nBayerische Motoren Werke Aktiengesellschaft (BMW AG), based in Munich, Germany, is the parent company of the BMW Group. The comments on the BMW Group and Automotive segment provided in earlier sections apply to BMW AG, unless presented differently in the following section. The Financial Statements of BMW AG are drawn up in accordance with the provisions of the German Commercial Code (HGB) and the relevant supplementary  requirements contained  in  the  German  Stock  Corporation Act (AktG).\n\nThe key financial performance indicator for BMW AG is the dividend payout ratio. This is defined as the unappropriated profit of BMW AG in accordance with HGB in relation to the Group net profit attributable to shareholders of BMW AG in accordance with IFRS. The key non-financial performance indicators are essentially  identical  and  concurrent  with  those  of  the  BMW Group. These are described in detail in the \u2197 Financial Performance section of the Combined Management Report.\n\n## Business environment and review of operations\n\nThe general and sector-specific environment of BMW AG is essentially the same as that of the BMW Group and is described in the \u2197 Financial Performance section of the Combined Management Report.\n\nBMW AG develops,  manufactures  and  sells  automobiles  and motorcycles as well as spare parts and accessories manufactured in-house, by foreign subsidiaries and by external suppliers, and performs services related to these products. Sales activities are  carried  out  primarily  through  branches,  subsidiaries,  independent  dealerships  and  importers.  Automobile  deliveries  increased  by  235,621  to  2,620,920  units  in  the  financial  year 2023. This figure includes 692,267 units relating to series sets supplied to BMW Brilliance Automotive Ltd., Shenyang, an increase of 50,473 units compared with the previous year.\n\nAs of  31  December 2023,  BMW AG  had  85,168  employees, plus 5,733 apprentices, interns and thesis students (31 December 2022 81,683 employees, plus 5,500 apprentices, interns and thesis students).\n\nThe year 2023 was characterised by a volatile business environment marked by increasing (geo-)political tensions. In addition, in many markets higher inflation rates accompanied by increased interest rates had a negative impact on the consumer climate. Despite these factors, BMW AG overall looks back on a positive business performance in the reporting year.\n\nBMW AG's solid financial condition is reflected in the results of operations, financial position and net assets reported for the financial year 2023. Business developed in line with management expectations. This assessment also takes into account events after the end of the reporting period.\n\nDifferences in accounting treatments based on HGB (used for the  Company  Financial  Statements)  and  IFRS  (used  for  the Group Financial Statements) are mainly to be found in connection with the capitalisation of intangible assets, the creation of valuation units, the recognition and measurement of financial instruments and provisions as well as the recognition of deferred tax assets. Differences also arise in the presentation of assets and liabilities and of items in the income statement.",

Price  and  product  mix  effects,  along  with  increased sales  volume,  had  a  positive  impact  on  revenue  growth.  Exchange rate factors also had a positive effect on revenues. Geographically, the increase in revenues was mainly attributable to Europe and Asia. Revenues totalled \u20ac 107,874 million (2022: \u20ac 98,807 million), of which Group internal revenues accounted for \u20ac 83,231 million (2022: \u20ac 77,843 million) or 77.2% (2022: 78.8%).\n\nFinancial Performance\n\nA large proportion of research and development expenses was related to new vehicle models, including the all -electric BMW i5* and Rolls Royce Spectre* models and the electrified BMW 5 Series, BMW X3 and BMW X5 models, as well as the development  of  digital  products,  automated  driving  and  the NEUE KLASSE. In line with the ramp -up of vehicles and the expenses  for  platforms  related  to  the  transformation  towards electromobility, research and development costs increased by 2.1% compared to the previous year.\n\nOther operating income was reduced to \u20ac 1,872 million (2022: \u20ac 2,529 million).The change was mainly due to lower reversals of  other  provisions  and  lower  income  from  financial  transactions.\n\nOther operating expenses decreased to \u20ac  2,067 million (2022: \u20ac 2,889 million) and, as in the previous year, mainly included expenses  from  financial  transactions  and  additions  to  other provisions.\n\nIncome from profit and loss transfer agreements with Group companies, reported in the line item Result on investments, decreased significantly. This was essentially due to the decrease in the profit of BMW INTEC Beteiliungs GmbH, Munich, which, among other things, received lower distributions.\n\nThe financial result improved by \u20ac 2,842 million compared to the previous year. The previous year mainly included higher expenses from the the fair value measurement of plan assets offset against pension obligations.\n\nTaxes on income resulted primarily from the current tax calculation for the financial year.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Depreciation and amortisation amounted to \u20ac 2,607 million (2022: \u20ac 2,452 million).\n\nInvestment assets remained in line with last year's level and totalled \u20ac 12,077 million (2022: \u20ac 12,093 million). Inventories increased to \u20ac 8,505 million (2022: \u20ac 7,523 million), primarily due to higher levels of finished goods and goods for resale.\n\nOther provisions decreased from \u20ac 11,686 million to \u20ac 11,537 million mainly due to a decline in provisions for taxes and provisions for liability risks. Conversely, the provision for statutory a nd non-statutory  warranty  and  product  guarantee  obligations  increased.\n\n## Outlook\n\nFor the financial year 2024, BMW AG expects an unchanged dividend payout ratio (unappropriated profit of BMW AG in accordance with HGB in relation to the Group net profit attributable to shareholders of BMW AG in accordance with IFRS), and therefore within the targeted range of between 30 and 40% (2023: 33.7%).\n\nmillion The  decrease  in  liabilities  to  subsidiaries  to  \u20ac 22,648  million (2022: \u20ac 25,703 million) was mainly due to the decline in financial liabilities.\n\nReceivables from subsidiaries declined to \u20ac 16,398 (2022: \u20ac 24,510 million). Specifically, there was a decrease in financial receivables from BMW INTEC Beteiliungs GmbH, Munich.\n\nThe increase in other receivables and other assets to \u20ac 3,120 million  (2022: \u20ac 2,281 million) was due in particular to an increase in other assets.\n\nLiquidity within the BMW Group is ensured by means of a liquidity concept applied uniformly across the Group. This involves concentrating a significant part of the Group's liquidity at the level of BMW AG. An important instrument in this context is the cash pool based at BMW AG.\n\nCash and cash equivalents decreased slightly by \u20ac 62 million to \u20ac  6,145  million  due  to  outflows  from  investing  and  financing activities. This was offset by the surplus from operating activities.\n\nEquity fell by \u20ac 2,286 million to \u20ac 17,932 million, mainly due to lower unappropriated profit and lower retained earnings as a result of the share buyback programmes. The equity ratio changed from 28.0% to 26.4%.\n\nIn order to secure pension obligations, cash funds totalling \u20ac  430 million were transferred to BMW Trust e. V., Munich, in conjunction with a Contractual Trust Arrangement (CTA), to be invested in plan assets. Plan assets are offset against the related guaranteed obligations.\n\nDeferred income went up by \u20ac  450 million to \u20ac 4,501 million and included primarily amounts for services still to be performed relating to service and maintenance contracts.\n\n## Risks and opportunities\n\nBMW AG's performance is essentially dependent on the same set  of  risks  and  opportunities  that  affect  the  BMW  Group  and which are described in detail in the \u2197 Risks and Opportunities chapter of the Combined Management Report. As a general rule, BMW AG participates in the risks entered into by Group companies in proportion  to  the  respective  shareholding  percentage.  At  the same time, the result on investments has a significant impact on the earnings of BMW AG.\n\nBMW AG is integrated in the Group-wide risk management system and internal control system of the BMW Group. Further information is provided in the \u2197 Internal Control System chapter of the Combined Management Report.\n\nDue to its significance in the Group and its close ties with Group companies, expectations for BMW AG with respect to its non-financial performance indicators correspond largely to the BMW Group's outlook. This is described in detail in the \u2197 Outlook chapter of the Combined Management Report.\n\nPricewaterhouseCoopers GmbH Wirtschaftspr\u00fcfungsgesellschaft, Frankfurt am Main, Munich branch, has issued an unqualified audit opinion on the Company Financial Statements of BMW AG, of which the balance sheet and the income statement are presented here. For the purposes of their inclusion in Company Register, the Company Financial Statements of BMW AG for the financial year 2023 will be submitted electronically to the body that maintains the Company Register, and may be obtained via the Company Register website.

It aims to channel capital flows towards environmentally sustainable economic activities.\n\nThe EU Taxonomy is a classification system that defines economic activities as environmentally sustainable based on fulfilment of predetermined technical screening criteria.\n\nEssentially, an economic activity can only be classified as sustainable if it substantially contributes to one of the following six environmental objectives:\n\n- I. Climate change mitigation\n- II. Climate change adaptation\n- III. Sustainable  use  and  protection  of  water  and  marine  resources\n- IV. Transition to a circular economy\n- V. Pollution prevention and control\n- VI. Protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems\n\nThis contribution is based on fulfilment of specific predetermined requirements. Moreover, no other environmental objective may be significantly harmed during performance of the activity and the company involved must observe minimum  safeguards, among them compliance with human rights.\n\nIn the previous year, the BMW Group reported on the Taxonomy eligible and Taxonomy-aligned proportion of its revenues, capital expenditure and operating expenditure for Environmental Objectives I and II. 1 From reporting year 2023 on, the BMW Group is also required to report on the proportion of Taxonomy-eligible revenues,  capital  expenditure  and  operating  expenditure  for\n\nEnvironmental Objectives III to VI for the first time, following the new Delegated Regulation 2023/2486. New activities for Environmental Objectives I and II are set out by Delegated Regulation 2023/2485. The BMW Group will be required to report on Taxonomy alignment for all environmental objectives from reporting year 2024 onwards.\n\n## Our holistic understanding of sustainability\n\nThe BMW Group supports the overarching goal of the EU Taxonomy to promote the private financing of environmentally sustainable economic activities in order to make Europe the world's first climate-neutral continent by 2050. As a company aspiring to achieve \u2197 Net zero across its entire value chain 2 by no later than 2050,  the  BMW Group  had  already  set  ambitious,  sciencebased  targets  for  all  three  scopes  in  2020,  which  it  aims  to achieve by 2030 (base year 2019). These goals were validated by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi). Each year, the BMW Group informs about the actual level of progress. \u2197 The BMW Group Strategy\n\nIn the coming years, as a result of the significant increase in electric mobility, the majority of carbon emissions will no longer be generated primarily in the use phase, but in the upstream value chain.  Without  the  planned  set  of  measures  to  reduce  carbon emissions generated within the BMW Group supply chain, these emissions (Scope 3 upstream) would already exceed actual carbon emissions in the use phase prior to 2030 (Scope 3 downstream) \u2197 The  BMW Group  Strategy , \u2197 Production  and  Supplier  Network , \u2197 Carbon Emissions . Accordingly, the BMW Group is taking a holistic approach  to  achieving  its  sustainability-related  targets  and  is committed to considering \u2197 Carbon Emissions over the entire life cycle. Among other things, the BMW Group's measures include a further reduction in energy demand, increased use of renewable energy (Scope 1 and 2), the use of new, efficiency-increasing\n\n]] technologies (Scope 3 downstream), the use of green electricity as a criterion when awarding contracts to suppliers and a continuously increasing secondary raw material quota (Scope 3 upstream). However, for the economic activities that are relevant to the BMW Group, the EU Taxonomy focuses exclusively on reducing carbon emissions during the use phase that are attributable to low-emissions (until 2025) and emissions-free drivetrains. Indirect carbon emissions, for instance those produced when generating charging current or during the energy-intensive production of high-voltage batteries, are not taken into account in the context of these economic activities. Moreover, the EU Taxonomy only reflects the impact of decarbonisation measures on inhouse production to the extent that they serve to manufacture Taxonomy-aligned products or to the extent that they are explicitly  included  in  the  description  of  an  activity.  For  example,  increasing the energy efficiency of paint shop processes also reduces carbon emissions in in-house production when an internal combustion engine vehicle  is painted.  The  BMW Group's  sustainability efforts in this regard is not or only partially taken into account as part of currently defined economic activities in the EU Taxonomy. \u2197 Carbon Emissions",

We will also be reporting on Taxonomy eligibility in relation to Environmental Objective  IV  'Transition  to  a  circular  economy'  for  the  first  time. There  are,  at  present,  no  economic  activities  relevant  to  the BMW Group relating to Environmental Objective III 'Sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources', Environmental Objective V 'Pollution prevention and control' or Environmental  Objective  VI  'Protection  and  restoration  of  biodiversity  and ecosystems'.  Taxonomy  eligibility  is  an  initial  indicator  of  the maximum environmental sustainability potential of economic activities as defined by the EU Taxonomy. Taxonomy alignment, on the other hand, serves as an indicator of an organisation's transformation  towards  environmentally  sustainable  economic activities.\n\n]] An economic activity is considered as Taxonomy-eligible if it is described in the Delegated Acts relating to one of the six environmental objectives, regardless of whether that economic activity meets the technical screening criteria stipulated in those Delegated Acts.

Economic  activity CCM 3.3 and economic activity CCM 6.5 both make a substantial contribution to Environmental Objective I 'Climate change mitigation' due to the manufacture as well as financing and leasing of  low-emission  (PHEV  <  50  g  CO2/km  WLTP  by  2025)  and zero-emission vehicles (BEV and motorcycles with 0 g CO2/km). Economic activity CCM 3.3 and economic activity CCM 6.5 as undertaken by the BMW Group are also described under Environmental  Objective  II  'Climate  change  adaptation'.  There  are, however, no identifiable values that can be separated from Environmental Objective I 'Climate change mitigation'. 1\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Climate change adaptation\n\nA robust climate risk and vulnerability assessment is required for both economic activity CCM 3.3 and economic activity CCM 6.5 to determine that they do not cause significant harm to Environmental Objective II. To satisfy this requirement, the physical climate risks at all key BMW Group production sites are considered and an assessment of any damage that may occur as a result of climate change is being carried out based on long-term climate projection scenarios 2 up to 2035 and 2050. Moreover, we consider potential natural hazards at all of our direct supplier locations in order to adequately take supply risks into account when selecting and evaluating suppliers. Adaptive solutions to mitigate risks are drawn up and implemented as appropriate based on the results of this risk analysis and in consultation with site representatives. For further information, see \u2197 Climate-related Risks and Opportunities .\n\nThe DNSH requirements for Environmental Objective II are fulfilled for economic activities CCM 3.3 and CCM 6.5.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSustainable use and protection of water and marine resources and protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems\n\nIn order to establish that no significant harm is caused to Environmental Objectives III and VI, it is necessary to perform  a comprehensive risk analysis that looks at the preservation and protection of environmental, water and marine resources for economic activity CCM 3.3 (in both cases, not relevant for economic activity CCM 6.5).\n\nIn order to identify the specific carbon emissions of PHEV that are  not  determined  in  line  with  Regulation  (EU)  2019/631 (among others, USA and China), assumptions were made based on  the  worst-case  value  for  that  vehicle  model,  even  though these emissions may have been lower in reality.\n\n## Do no significant harm\n\nCompliance with the DNSH criteria was reviewed in the reporting year  for  the  five  additional  environmental  objectives,  based  in each case on the specific requirements for economic activity CCM 3.3 'Manufacture of low carbon technologies for transport' and economic activity CCM 6.5 'Transport by motorbikes, passenger cars and light commercial vehicles'.\n\nThe  vehicle  portfolio  for  economic  activity  CCM  6.5  includes BMW Group vehicles and vehicles from other manufacturers. As no data are available regarding the relevant attributes of these third-party products, it is currently not possible to make a comprehensive assessment in relation to the DNSH criteria. For this reason, these vehicles are currently not reported as Taxonomyaligned.\n\nIn this context, the BMW Group carries out environmental impact assessments in accordance with Directive 2011/92/EU during the construction of new and expansion of existing sites within the EU that also take account of water and biodiversity. At locations outside the EU, the BMW Group carries o ut an environmental impact assessment based on EU requirements. Moreover, a certified environmental management system pursuant to ISO 14001 has been implemented at all BMW Group production sites and all local statutory requirements are met. \u2197 Resource Management at all locations\n\nThe DNSH requirements for Environmental Objectives III and VI are fulfilled for economic activity CCM 3.3.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Transition to a circular economy\n\nThe requirements for both economic activities of the BMW Group to do no significant harm to Environmental Objective IV differ for each stage of the value chain. We fulfil these requirements during the manufacturing process for BMW Group vehicles (economic activity CCM 3.3) by, for example, using secondary raw materials in  our  products,  designing products to facilitate their recycling, managing waste at our production sites in a way that prioritises recycling over disposal, and systematically registering stances of concern along the entire supply chain. With regard to the use phase and recycling of BMW Group vehicles (economic activity CCM 6.5), we have set up appropriate processes to comply  with  recycling  requirements  and  established  measures  for managing waste during maintenance and at the end of the life cycle. All these criteria also form part of our comprehensive approach to the \u2197 Transition to a circular economy .\n\nsub-\n\n]] The DNSH requirements for Environmental Objective IV are fulfilled for economic activities CCM 3.3 and CCM 6.5.\n\n<!-- image -->",

All substances used by the BMW Group are in compliance with national and European laws. Substitutes are sought for hazardous substances that are categorised as being of very high concern in accordance with Article 57 and 59 of the REACH Regulation, if they are used directly or in a proportion exceeding 0.1% weight by weight in a mixture in the production processes of the BMW Group and are consequently contained in the products of the BMW  Group, while taking factors such as economic and technical requirements into account.  If  the  use  of  these  hazardous  substances  cannot  be avoided, the BMW Group uses them under controlled conditions in accordance with hazardous material regulations.\n\nOn the other hand, it is not possible to meet all criteria to do no significant harm to Environmental Objective V in the case of economic activity CCM 6.5. Current PHEV models with air pollutant emissions under 50 g CO2/km WLTP offered by the BMW Group and other manufacturers may make a substantial contribution as defined by the EU Taxonomy. However, manufacturer specifications for air pollutant emissions in  real driving conditions (real driving emissions, RDE) can only be reduced for selected models to 80% of the limit as required by the EU Taxonomy with reference to table 2 in the annex to the Clean Vehicles Directive, due to  potentially  extreme  driving  situations.  The  vast  majority  of PHEV in the vehicle portfolio for economic activity CCM 6.5 must therefore  be  considered  not  Taxonomy-aligned,  even  if  they meet these values in everyday driving situations.\n\nFor the remaining PHEV and BEV models in the BMW Group's vehicle portfolio, further deductions have to be made for individual models in the context of economic activity CCM 6.5 in light of\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nthe requirements for rolling resistance coefficients for tyres and in particular the external rolling noise of tyres. Owing to the limited availability of data, the eligibility of the models concerned is calculated in a simplified manner based on the tyres approved for these models, weighted by their purchase volumes and take rates.\n\nThe DNSH requirements for Environmental Objective V are fulfilled for economic activity CCM 3.3; however, not all are fulfilled for economic activity CCM 6.5, owing to the RDE and tyre label requirements described.\n\n## Minimum safeguards\n\nAdditionally, companies that carry out economic activities as defined by the EU Taxonomy are required to establish minimum safeguards. These require the implementation of processes to ensure compliance with due diligence obligations both within an organisation  and  in  stages  of  the  upstream  and  downstream value chain that have been outsourced. Specifically, this refers to compliance with human rights and topics like bribery, corruption, taxation and fair competition. In its \u2197 Policy statement on respect for human rights and corresponding environmental standards , the BMW Group has, among other things, committed to compliance with the following  standards  for  minimum  safeguards  as  defined  in  Article 18 of the Taxonomy Regulation: Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Guidelines for Multinational  Enterprises,  the  UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and the Ten Principles of the UN Global Compact, which we signed back in 2001. \u2197 Purchasing and Supplier Network , \u2197 Compliance and Human Rights\n\nThe minimum safeguard requirements are met.\n\n## EU Taxonomy performance indicators\n\nPlease refer to the remarks in the glossary for the definition and calculation of the Taxonomy- specific performance indicators revenues, capital expenditure and operating expenditure and their differentiation from IFRS. \u2197 Glossary\n\nThe proportion of total revenues, capital expenditure and operating expenditure relating to eligible and non-eligible economic activities are shown in each case as an aggregate percentage for\n\nthe  BMW  Group.  All  Taxonomy-eligible  revenues,  capital  expenditure and operating expenditure for economic activities CCM 3.3 and CCM 6.5 are disclosed under Environmental Objective I 'Climate change mitigation', given that there are no identifiable values for Environmental Objective II 'Climate change adaptation' that can be separated from Environmental Objective I 'Climate change mitigation'. This approach avoids double counting of revenues, capital expenditure and operating expenditure when determining the KPI in the numerator across multiple economic activities.\n\nIn the case of capital expenditure and operating expenditure, all Taxonomy-eligible expenditure is allocated to the two economic activities CCM 3.3 and CCM 6.5. There is no separable Taxonomy-eligible capital expenditure and operating expenditure for economic activity CE 5.4.\n\nIn most cases, values from financial data were allocated directly to  the  economic  activities  for  all  three  performance  indicators, based for example on the drivetrain or the vehicle model. In the remaining cases, an allocation mechanism was used for each economic activity and each performance indicator. For Taxonomy-eligible and Taxonomy-aligned capital expenditure for economic activity CCM 3.3, the allocator is based on long -term Taxonomy-aligned  revenues  generated  from  the  Automotive  and Motorcycles segment:\n\n- -Allocator for economic activity CCM 3.3: Proportion (BEV + PHEV [<50 g CO2]) x Automotive segment revenues (2024-2029) *\n\n]] The allocator is based on detailed long-term corporate planning for the next six years, as approved each year by the Board of Management  and  Supervisory  Board.  It  is  used  for  capital expenditure on property, plant and equipment (including right -ofuse  assets  from  lessee  relationships),  intangible  assets  and expenditure on research and development for economic activity CCM 3.3. For operating expenditure, the allocator is only applied to non-capitalised development costs.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Regardless of the Taxonomy requirements, the BMW Group regularly and comprehensively dresses risks arising from climate change and their potential impact  on  its  sites  and  supply  chains. \u2197 DNSH  adaptation  to  climate change , \u2197 TCFD climate risks\n\n## -BMW Group perspective\n\nAll  three  performance indicators have grown markedly on the previous year at BMW Group level, highlighting that the BMW Group is on the right track with its sustainable economic activities relating to the EU Taxonomy.\n\nTaxonomy-aligned revenues of the BMW Group amounted to \u20ac 23,690 million (2022: \u20ac 15,705 million), corresponding to 15% of total Group revenues and an increase on the previous  year  of  four  percentage  points.  The  Taxonomyaligned share of capital expenditure was 26% (\u20ac  7,926 million), which corresponds to an increase of almost five percentage  points  on  2022.  Taxonomy-aligned  capital  expenditure as a proportion of the BMW Group's total capital expenditure is impacted significantly by additions related to\n\nleased products. Consequently, an examination of the proportion  of  Taxonomy-aligned  capital  expenditure  at  BMW Group level does not reflect the huge investment in sustainable economic activities and products. Operating expenditure incurred for Taxonomy-aligned economic activities amounted to \u20ac 2,051 million, corresponding to over 31% of Taxonomy-eligible operating expenditure (2022: 29%). \u2197 Voluntary additional  information  on  the  Taxonomy-aligned  share  per economic activity\n\nto\n\nthe\n\n## -Economic activity CCM 3.3, 'Manufacture of low-carbon technologies for transport'\n\nThe Taxonomy-aligned share of revenues generated by the Automotive and Motorcycles segment corresponded to 15.0% (economic activity  CCM  3.3  'Manufacture  of  lowcarbon technologies for transport') of total Group revenues (2022: 10.7%). As a percentage of third-party revenues of the  two  segments,  the  Taxonomy-aligned  share  rose  to 22.1% (2022: 15.7%). As a result, revenues from the Automotive and Motorcycles segment that are associated with the  manufacture of  low-carbon  technologies  for  transport (CCM 3.3) increased by approximately 41%. In contrast to the previous year, revenues from pre-owned vehicles in the Automotive segment are reported under the new economic activity CE 5.4, somewhat dampening the rise in Taxonomy aligned revenues. \u2197 Segment information\n\n## -Economic activity CCM 6.5, 'Transport by motorbikes, passenger cars and light commercial vehicles'\n\nThe Taxonomy-aligned shares for the three performance indicators are at a low single-digit level for the Financial Services segment. This is due to the fact that there is a time lag before the effects of the vehicle fleet electrification ramp-up are reflected in the financing and leasing lines of business. A further reason is the varied, stricter DNSH requirements for economic activity CCM 6.5, in particular those relating to Environmental Objective V 'Pollution prevention and control', which lead to the exclusion of almost all PHEV and a significant restriction in the recognition of BEV (for details see section \u2197 Do no significant harm ). Third-party brands are not included in the vehicle portfolio in the reporting on Taxonomy alignment for economic activity CCM 6.5. A lack of available data regarding the tyre categories or WLTP emissions values of third-party products makes it impossible to review compliance with the DNSH criteria in full. Moreover, revenues from the sale of lease returns are reported under the new economic activity CE 5.4, differently from the previous year. The Financial Services segment recorded a decline in revenues for 2023 in absolute terms following the reallocation of revenue components to the new economic activity CE 5.4. The Taxonomy-aligned proportion of capital expenditure in the Financial Services segment rose by more than 50% on the previous year to 3.3% (\u20ac 1,018 million). Based on total capital expenditure in the Financial Services segment, the Taxonomy-aligned proportion rose by significantly more than 40% to 5.4%. \u2197 Voluntary additional information on the Taxonomy-aligned share per economic activity\n\n## -Economic activity CE 5.4, 'Sale of second-hand goods'\n\n- ]] As  stipulated  by  Delegated  Regulation  2023/2486,  the BMW Group only reports on the Taxonomy-eligible proportion of revenues for economic activity CE 5.4. This economic activity  includes  revenues  from  pre-owned  vehicles  in  the Automotive segment and revenues from the sale of used cars after their intended use by clients in the Financial Services segment, but does not include revenues from the sale of  used  motorcycles.  Around  12%  of  total  revenues  are Taxonomy-eligible in reporting year 2023.\n\nThe Taxonomy-aligned proportion of capital expenditure in the Automotive and Motorcycles segment rose to 22.7% from 19.1% in the previous year. Looking only at the Taxonomy-aligned additions to intangible assets and property, plant and equipment in the context of additions recorded by the Automotive and Motorcycles segment, however, gives rise to a considerably higher proportion of Taxonomyaligned capital expenditure of more than 60%. Segmentspecific  capital  expenditure  is  thus  around  17  percentage points higher than in the previous year. This was driven by increased investment in sustainable products and plant infrastructure as part of electrification. This underscores the BMW Group's extensive capital expenditure on sustainable products and technologies. \u2197 Voluntary additional information on the Taxonomy-aligned share per economic activity",

This plan has been approved by the Board of Management of BMW AG and covers a seven-year period (2023-2029). The CapEx plan covers capital expenditure and operating expenditure for  the  reporting  year  and  planned capital expenditure and operating expenditure (only non-capitalised development costs) for 2023-2029 for economic activities CCM 3.3 and CCM 6.5. The selected future period corresponds to the detailed long-term corporate planning of the BMW Group\n\n]] and contains various investment measures with different implementation times (e.g. electrification of the vehicle fleet, model revisions,  structural  investments in production sites). The CapEx plan earmarks \u20ac 68,473 million for economic activity CCM 3.3 and  \u20ac 24,847 million  for  economic  activity  CCM  6.5.  The  increase in Taxonomy-aligned capital expenditure and operating expenditure as compared to the previous year's plan can largely be attributed to the anticipated faster electrification of the vehicle portfolio in the Automotive and Motorcycles segments and, with a time delay, in the financing and leasing lines of business, and generally higher capital expenditure and operating expenditure associated with electrification until the end of the decade.\n\n## [[ CapEx plan for expansion of or transformation into Taxonomy-aligned economic activities\n\n]]\n\n| in \u20ac million                                                          | Code(s)   | 2023  2023-2029   | 2022  2022-2028   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-------------------|-------------------|\n| Economic activities                                                   |           |                   |                   |\n| Manufacture of low carbon technologies for transport                  | CCM 3.3   | 68,473            | 55,989            |\n| Transport by motorbikes, passenger cars and light commercial vehicles | CCM 6.5   | 24,847            | 16,520            |\n| Total                                                                 |           | 93,320            | 72,509            |",

Innovations  help  to  optimise  processes,  improve products and introduce new technologies.\n\nRemaining consistently one step ahead while keeping a firm eye on the future is a core aspect of our philosophy as a company and an expression of our firm commitment to innovation. The BMW Group works tirelessly to provide our customers with forward-thinking  solutions  today  to  simplify  their  daily  lives.  The new BMW 5 series, for example, achieves a new level of digital connectivity with its completely novel assistance systems. The BMW VISION Neue Klasse offers a first glimpse at our next product generation.\n\n## BMW VISION Neue Klasse\n\n]] With the BMW VISION Neue Klasse, the BMW Group is demonstrating what the next generation of core BMW brand vehicles will look like. The Vision Vehicle, which was unveiled to the public for  the  first  time  at  the  International  Motor  Show  IAA  Mobility 2023 in Munich, features a clear design language that is reduced to the essentials with spacious surfaces and a small number of striking lines. This approach focuses on signature features like the BMW kidney grille and the Hofmeister kink in the side windows. The design radiates more of the essence of BMW than ever.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\n[[ In the interior, the next generation of the BMW iDrive provides a unique digital user experience: analogue controls are reduced to a minimum in the BMW VISION Neue Klasse. The driver interacts with the vehicle via the BMW Panoramic Vision, the central display unit and multifunctional buttons on the steering wheel. The user experience is complemented by the tried-and-tested voice control system via the BMW Intelligent Personal Assistant. The next generation of the BMW iDrive thus offers a modern interpretation of the brand's typical driver-oriented focus. Similar to the BMW iDrive controller that was formerly on the centre console or the BMW head-up display, the brand is setting new standards with the BMW Panoramic Vision, which will be available for the first time in the NEUE KLASSE. It projects information at a height ideally aligned with the driver's line of sight and, for the first time, across the entire width of the windscreen. This innovation will complement the enhanced BMW head-up display in the NEUE KLASSE series models.\n\nThe BMW VISION Neue Klasse is also characterised by the increased use of secondary raw materials, resource-friendly production  methods  and  an  electric  drive  system  featuring  sixthgeneration BMW eDrive technology.\n\nThe BMW VISION Neue Klasse represents the entire range of technological innovations with which the BMW Group is underlining its future entrepreneurial viability. It stands for the dawn of a new era of individual mobility: electric, digital and circular.\n\n## Digitalisation stands for innovation and customer focus\n\nDigitalisation is a key element in keeping the vehicle constantly up to date for customers long after they have taken delivery of their new automobile. Since the launch of Operating System 7 in 2018, remote software upgrades 1 have been available for BMW vehicles. Apart from these software upgrades, the BMW Group also releases new functions and features on an ongoing basis. At the end of 2023, over six million BMW vehicles worldwide were already fully updatable. In other words, these vehicles can be  updated  in  every  respect,  including  infotainment,  the  drive system,  driver  assistance,  convenience  and  safety.  The  BMW Group can currently update over 30 derivatives of all its drive variants remotely over the air.\n\nBMW ConnectedDrive upgrades also allow additional functions to be either bought or simply booked for a specific period after the vehicle has been initially purchased.\n\n## The vehicle as a digital experience\n\nThe latest generation of BMW Group vehicles offers customers a maximum of interaction, infotainment and connectivity. State-ofthe-art on- and off-board technologies such as 5G connectivity and cloud services make the latest BMW vehicles an integral part of their users' digital ecosystems. The comprehensive connectivity enables a whole host of digital services and functions, from smart and learning navigation to in -car gaming  and  video streaming. The vehicle is thus becoming the 'next living space' for its users.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Digital connectivity and automation\n\nAutomated functions and digitally connected vehicles can help cut emissions, reduce the risk of accidents and ease traffic congestion. That's why the BMW Group is consistently driving this issue forward - with a sharp focus on customer convenience and safety.\n\n]] To ensure the safety of automated systems, the BMW Group is promoting the development of industry-wide ISO standards for partially, highly and fully automated driving functions. The work on classifying the standardisation of SAE 3 Level 3 and Level 4 functions has resulted in an ISO technical report that is due to be published  as  an  ISO  technical  specification  in  2024.  Furthermore, in 2023 an ISO PAS standard was published that supports the introduction of Level 2 systems with innovative driver integration. The documents define uniform technical standards for safe assisted and automated driving.\n\nWith the further development of the BMW iDrive in 2023 and the 'QuickSelect' fast access concept, an improved menu structure based on devices from the consumer electronics sector is being added to the system. With the right information in the right place, the new BMW iDrive provides users with a concentrated, confident  driving  experience.  The  latest  BMW  iDrive  generation  is based on the BMW Operating System 8.5 and BMW Operating System 9. 2\n\nThe latest MINI vehicles in the 'New MINI Family' also incorporate  these  technology  modules  and,  with  the  MINI  Operating System 9, offer their customers an unmistakable digital user experience typical for the MINI brand. The iconic, round OLED display takes centre stage in this concept.\n\n## Software expertise at the BMW Group\n\nMore than twenty years ago, with the founding of BMW Car IT the BMW Group began developing its own software Since then, the company has continued to expand its teams of developers to form a global network. Beginning with the Ulm site in southern Germany, its software expertise has been bolstered by the joint ventures Critical TechWorks in Portugal and BA TechWorks in China.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 1 The availability and contents of remote software upgrades depends on the country, model, equipment and software version installed.\n- 2 The use of OS 8.5 and OS 9 depends on the vehicle class and the production period.\n- 3 SAE (Society of Automotive Engineers) levels categorise the degree of automation from manual to autonomous driving in five stages.\n- 4 \u2197 Consumption and Carbon Disclosures.",

The BMW Highway Assistant enables drivers to take their hands off the steering wheel and place them in a comfortable position when driving for prolonged distances. The function is also supplemented by a new feature: the  Active  Lane  Change  assistant  with  driver's  gaze  confirmation, which enables the vehicle to change lanes automatically without the driver having to touch the steering wheel. All the driver needs to do is glance at the wing mirrors to confirm the lane change. The prerequisites  for  this  technology  include  high-precision  sensors,  a  powerful computing platform and connection to the BMW Cloud.\n\nTake your hands off the steering wheel and temporarily turn your attention away from the  traffic situation - this is highly automated driving at Level 3 and can be experienced in new BMW 7 Series models as of March 2024. BMW Personal Pilot L3 is the name of the new function that relieves customers of the task of driving in defined traffic situations and regulates speed, distance and lane guidance for them. The innovative system enables drivers to engage in secondary activities (such as writing messages or watching video streaming) on highways with structurally separated lanes and at speeds of up to 60 km/h. ]]\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- * Munich test site - pilot test of automated driving in urban traffic.\n\n## New generation of battery cells\n\nHigh-performance, innovative and sustainably produced battery cells are the key to success for individual electric mobility. With its NEUE KLASSE models, as of 2025 the BMW Group will be using newly developed, round battery cells for the first time, which are optimally coordinated to suit the new architecture. The sixth generation of our lithium-ion cells represents a giant technological leap forward compared with the previous generation, effectively increasing energy density by more than 20%, charging speed by up to 30% and range by around 30%. The carbon emissions generated by cell production will be reduced by up to 60%.\n\n## Electrified vehicles as part of the power grid\n\n[[ During the year under report, the BMW Group opened a new test site, the Future Mobility Development Centre in Sokolov, Czech Republic, where we are currently testing automated driving and parking functions and even fully automated driving (Level 4) on an area of 600 hectares. With the help of virtual simulations and real-life testing, all driving situations are covered, whether in the city, in the country, on the highway or when parking. We are thus creating the basis for meeting our customers' high safety standards when it comes to automated driving. We also operate research facilities in Munich, where  we  were  involved  in  the \u2197 TEMPUS * research project in collaboration with the city authorities. Between 2021 and 2023, we gathered practical experience on a wide range of use cases relating to automated driving functions and innovative mobility services in urban areas. The BMW Group also has research facilities located in China and the USA, enabling  it  to  integrate  its  two  largest  markets  with  regard  to road- and traffic law-related issues right from the outset.\n\nThe new BMW 5 Series sets new standards in terms of digital connectivity  and  automation.  Among  other  things,  the  vehicle can be optionally equipped with a highway assistant, which permanently takes over distance control and steering tasks and, for the  first  time,  actively  changes  lanes  when  confirmed  by  the driver's gaze.\n\nFollowing recent approval by the Federal Motor Transport Authority, the new BMW 7 Series will be equipped with Level 3 functions for the first time. The option will be available as of March 2024, making the BMW Group one of the leading automobile manufacturers in the field of highly automated driving.\n\n## Drivetrain technologies of the future\n\nWhen developing  drive  system  technologies,  the  BMW  Group considers the needs of its customers worldwide. For this reason we are constantly developing existing drivetrain technologies in the interests of efficiency, decarbonisation and resource conservation. At the same time, we continue to research new drivetrain technologies with the ultimate aim of developing them for series production.\n\n]] The BMW Group is conducting its own research and development work with the aim of integrating electrified vehicles in the power grid. The focus is on technologies such as smart charging, a key component of the \u2197 BMW ChargeForward service, which enables customers to synchronise their charging behaviour with the current grid load and the use of renewable energy. The technology has been available to all drivers of electrified vehicles in the USA  since  November  2023.  Another  cross-sectoral project known as \u2197 Bidirectional Charging Management (BCM) was successfully completed at the end of 2022. Over a period of three years, the BMW Group, together with grid operators and universities, tested how electric vehicles can become mobile energy storage units and thus part of the power grid system. The results of the project underline the great potential of bidirectional charging and were incorporated  in  an  initial  customer  offering,  Connected  Home Charging, in 2023. The project is a strategic cooperation with the grid operator E.ON, which aims to establish a Europe-wide ecosystem for smart charging at home. The innovation enables customers to connect their electrified BMW or MINI vehicle with their smart home and the power grid. The service has been available in an initial expansion stage in several European countries since late  2023.  In  the  coming  years,  it  is  to  be  expanded  and  extended to include additional scope with the ultimate aim of enabling bidirectional charging as well.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Our holistic activities comprise the following three pillars and underline BMW Group's commitment to innovation:\n\n- -Corporate: The virtualisation of internal processes, methods and  products  with  real-time  collaboration,  regardless of location\n- For example, as part of the iFactory, planners can use virtual reality to virtually assess buildings, systems, logistics and the assembly of new production areas and test processes in 3D, long before construction is scheduled to begin.\n- -Commercial:  Interaction  with  both  new  and  existing  techsavvy target groups in virtual spaces and virtual worlds.\n\nIn\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- -In-car experiences: Enhancing the quality of experience with a focus on infotainment, productivity and gaming.\n\nthe With the M Mixed Reality approach, for example, a team of engineers at BMW M GmbH has developed an immersive driving experience for the BMW M2 and M4, which is now being made available to Driving Experience customers for the first time. Wearing VR goggles, drivers can be immersed in a virtual world while driving the real vehicle. In addition, the BMW Group has made further inroads into the gaming scene with the launch of Air Console, i.e. casual gaming in numerous current BMW and MINI models.\n\n## Artificial intelligence\n\nIn recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) has been increasingly developed and performs ever more comprehensive tasks. GPTs (Generative  Pretrained  Transformers)  support  and  accelerate operational processes, including creative tasks. The technology holds considerable potential for the way we work, collaborate, develop, share knowledge and interact with our customers and how the future experience within our vehicles will be designed.\n\nThe development of generative AI is still in its infancy and industrialisation  has  only  just  begun.  We  are  already  using the  first tools based on this technology or investigating its potential for specific applications, such as:\n\n- Motorrad -Image-generating AI for end-to-end support of our design and vehicle construction processes\n\nEngagement on digital platforms enables experienceoriented interaction with young target groups (Gen Z) within their  digital  ecosystems  with the  aim  of  enhancing  brand image and developing long-term customer loyalty. dedicated virtual worlds such as the BMW MetaRide, innovative products can be experienced in a new way and supported throughout the entire customer journey.\n\n- -Large language models, such as those on which ChatGPT is based, for voice applications within the vehicle\n\nwell\n\nas\n\n- -Text and image generation applications, as knowledge management based on large language models for exploration for all employees\n- -Application  of generative  AI  in  various  processes  at  the BMW Group, such as:\n- -Market and sales communication, e.g. generated marketing texts\n- -Knowledge management for customer interaction in call centres\n- -Knowledge  management  or  comparison  of  offers  in purchasing\n- -Testing and comparison of vehicle specifications\n- -Coding support for IT and vehicle development\n\n## Shaping the future of mobility\n\nThe BMW Group is involved in numerous research and implementation  projects  for  developing  new  mobility  concepts.  The main focus is on \u2197 pilot projects that improve the quality of life and promote more sustainable urban mobility. In Munich, we are coinitiators  of  the  new \u2197 Mobile Future Alliance Munich .  Together with policymakers, the Technical University of Munich and the Munich Transport and Tariff Association, a strategy for sustainable mobility in the greater Munich area is to be developed. Specifically, it  is  about  using  street  space  more  efficiently,  creating  open spaces for liveable urban areas, establishing new mobility solutions and promoting parking space management, among other things.\n\n]] In Rotterdam, we are working with the city authorities, Erasmus University and other local partners on various pilot projects, including the improved interconnectedness of different modes of transport (intermodality), visionary urban vehicle concepts and the more efficient use of charging infrastructure. The BMW  Group also held a \u2197 stakeholder dialogue together with the City of Rotterdam in the reporting year. Over 100 participants from city administrations, the scientific community, industry and start-ups from Europe, the USA and China discussed the urban mobility of the future. The findings are now being incorporated into other projects.\n\n<!-- image -->",

According to this principle, we focus on collaborations in which the BMW Group complements its strengths with those of established  partners  and  innovation drivers such as start-ups, enabling  us  to  continue  developing  our  innovative  strengths.  The global network of BMW Group Technology Offices is also making an essential contribution to maintaining the Group's leading role in terms of innovation.\n\nThese offices are strategically positioned worldwide and focus on key hotspots of technology and innovation. The potential of new technologies is therefore being explored in pilot projects and transferred to the Group's centralised teams. Whether manufacturing, developing smart city solutions or the mobility of the future, these Technology Offices are driving forward innovations that benefit the Group in all its lines of business.\n\nGlobal  dialogue  with  start-ups  is  an  important  means for  the BMW Group to gain impetus. This is based on three pillars, comprising \u2197 BMW i Ventures (through  which we invest in technology start-ups), the start-up \u2197 Platform URBAN-X (a MINI brand-initiated start-up  that  focuses  primarily  on  urban  living)  and the \u2197 BMW Startup Garage . The latter serves as the BMW Group's venture client unit and is tasked with searching for innovations that represent a significant benefit for products, services, systems and processes. The aim of the programme is to evaluate and empower start-ups to become suppliers and partners.\n\nThe trend research conducted by the technology offices enables the BMW Group to anticipate the technological developments of tomorrow. The results are made publicly available in the \u2197 Trend Radar where  scientific  institutions,  start-ups,  but  also  potential partners can make use of them.\n\nWhen it opened in Silicon Valley in 1998, the BMW Group Technology Office USA was the Group's first research and development  facility  to  be  established  outside  of  Munich.  Originally\n\nbased in Palo Alto, the BMW tech office moved to its current location  in  Mountain  View  in  2011.  Today,  the  Mountain  View team is part of a global network of BMW tech offices strategically located in key technology hotspots around the world. They all play a crucial role in the BMW Group's open approach to innovation. Apart from the locations in Silicon Valley and Munich, the worldwide network also includes Seoul, Shanghai, Tel Aviv and Tokyo.\n\n## Worldwide cooperations and partnerships\n\nTo ensure its long-term success, the BMW Group enters into targeted cooperations and partnerships with companies from various industries Several of the Group's largest collaborations and investments are listed below:\n\nIn collaboration with Amazon Web Services (AWS), BMW Group is developing innovative cloud technologies for processing vehicle data. The two companies are also working together to develop commercial standard cloud solutions for the secure handling of vehicle data. The agreement is a continuation of the partnership in the field of vehicle data that began back in 2015. As in all previous collaborations with BMW Group retains full and exclusive control over the data and complies with the data protection regulations applicable in its respective markets.\n\nAWS,\n\nt\n\nSince the launch of the first BMW voice assistant (BMW Intelligent Personal Assistant) in 2018, voice interaction has become an increasingly important part of the BMW iDrive display and operating concept. The next generation of the voice assistant will be based on Amazon's Alexa technology, thus enabling an even more natural dialogue between driver and vehicle.\n\nProgram The BMW Group is continuously building on its various cooperation arrangements aimed at expanding charging infrastructure in general. In addition to the BMW Group, Mercedes-Benz, Ford, Porsche, Volkswagen, Audi, Hyundai/Kia and BlackRock are all involved in the long-established IONITY joint venture. The aim is to set up an efficient, high-power charging network for electric vehicles right across Europe.\n\nSince 2022, the BMW Group and Qualcomm Technologies have been working together to develop solutions for the next generation of automated driving. The three companies aim to develop technologies ranging from New Car Assessment (NCAP) solutions and advanced Level 2 driving assistance systems to the Level 3 functionalities of highly automated driving. The joint development of software functions is based on BMW's current software toolkit for automated driving. Within the terms of the cooperation, ultimately some 1,300 specialists will work together at various locations worldwide, including sites in Germany, the USA, Sweden, China, Romania and the BMW Test Centre in Sokolov in the Czech Republic.\n\nThe HERE mapping service was acquired by BMW, MercedesBenz and Audi in 2015. Continental,  Intel, Mitsubishi,  Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, and Pioneer are also current shareholders. The participation in HERE ensures long-term access to scalable, high-resolution maps. The development of a centralised, more efficient geo-database, from which all HERE products (including the currently used SD navigation map and HD maps) can be fed and continuously updated, was completed in 2023.\n\nOn 19 October 2023, the BMW Group jointly founded a company together with General Motors, Honda, Hyundai, Kia, Mercedes-Benz and Stellantis. The partners are working together with the aim of establishing a public charging network in the USA and Canada.\n\n]] On 6 November 2023, the BMW Group signed an agreement with Mercedes-Benz to establish a company based in China with the objective of building charging infrastructure in that market. The approval by the antitrust authorities has already been given. The  BMW Group  holds  a  50%  stake in  the  recently  founded company. \u2197 Reliable and comprehensive charging opportunities\n\nth",

The range of services  provides  customers  with  access  to  various  modes  of transport other than their own vehicle.\n\nAs Europe's largest multimodal mobility platform, FREE NOW combines the entire range of various forms of mobility in one app. Apart from taxi cabs and private ride services, various types of e scooters as well as car-sharing vehicles can also be booked via the FREE NOW app. By 2025, the share of electrically powered trips is projected to increase to 50% and users are set to travel fully electrically as of 2030.\n\n]] The BMW Group offers a range of additional mobility services in the MyBMW app. It provides customers with access to exclusive FREE NOW services and, in cooperation with SIXT, to rental cars with exclusive specialised services. This BMW add-on mobility offering is currently available to BMW and MINI customers in a growing number of markets. For business customers and fleet operators, among other services the BMW Group offers keyless vehicle use for flexible fleet concepts or digital and efficient vehicle management options. The BMW Group's range of services also  includes  comprehensive charging solutions for the home, the workplace and on the road. \u2197 Reliable and comprehensive charging opportunities\n\n## PRODUCT QUALITY AND SAFETY\n\n[[ All BMW Group products and services are required to meet the highest standards in terms of quality and safety, People's safety has top priority, right from the product development stage. With this point in mind, optimum chassis tuning, highly effective braking systems and stable passenger compartments are key factors. Moreover, BMW Group vehicles are equipped with state-ofthe-art safety systems that reduce the risk of accidents and injuries (active safety systems such as collision warning or lane departure warning systems) as well as mitigate the consequences in the event of an accident (passive safety systems such as airbags or seat belts).\n\nWe are also working continuously to further improve the safety of our vehicles. In 2023, the new BMW 5 Series achieved top marks in the European New Car Assessment Programme (Euro NCAP). The new BMW i5 * was also named 'Safest car of the year' by the Korean New Car Assessment Programme (KNCAP). Further awards gained in 2023 included the 'Top Safety Pick+' from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS, USA) for the new BMW 5 Series, the BMW X3 and the BMW X1, as well as a triple 'Good' rating in the China Insurance Automotive Safety Index (C IASI) for the BMW X1. \u2197 GRI Index: 416-1 \u2197 SASB Index\n\n## Quality management\n\nIn addition to its high quality and compliance with statutory regulations and standards, the BMW Group's comprehensive quality management system also focuses on ensuring the safety of its products. From the development stage to manufacturing, they are  therefore  subject  to  rigorous  testing  procedures.  Furthermore, any information received from customers regarding potential deviations from quality standards are systematically followed up.\n\nIf a safety risk or a compliance-related defect is found, the BMW Group implements all the measures required to remedy the issue following  detailed  discussions  with  the  relevant  authorities.  In 2023, safety- and compliance-related technical campaigns affected around 1.8 million vehicles (2022: 3.4 million vehicles). All these actions were voluntary and carried out in coordination with the authorities concerned. The BMW Group works according to the principle of prevention. To avoid technical campaigns of this type going forward, the BMW Group has also developed a comprehensive programme that has been in place since 2023.\n\n## Pollutants management\n\n]] To the extent possible, the BMW Group excludes the use of problematic substances right from the vehicle design stage and sets out corresponding stipulations for its suppliers. Guidance is provided in the form of the \u2197 Global Automotive Declarable Substance List (GADSL) .  At  the  same time, we are working to reduce pollutant emissions in the interior of our vehicles to an absolute minimum. All BMW, MINI and Rolls-Royce brand vehicles are equipped as standard with interior air filters that prevent exterior pollutants and particles such as dust or pollen from entering the vehicle. Since 2020, the BMW Group has been using air filters equipped with nanofibre technology that are specially designed to prevent certain microbial particles and allergens as well as ultra -fine particulate matter from entering the vehicle.",

Information  on  safety,  the  correct  operation  of  vehicles,  and health protection is available in both printed and digital form. The information is supplemented by detailed notes and background information on the services, accessories and components pertaining to each individual vehicle.\n\nThe BMW Group collaborates closely with the relevant data protection  supervisory  authorities -  particularly  regarding  fundamental data protection issues such as those arising from the increasing connectivity of vehicles. \u2197 GRI Index: 3-3, 418-1\n\n## Secure connectivity\n\nWith the \u2197 BMW M Driving Experience , the BMW Group offers driver and  rider  safety  training  for  BMW,  MINI  and  BMW  Motorrad brand vehicles in 25 countries. Participants learn how to handle their vehicles in a safe manner and are sensitised to recognise dangerous situations in road tr affic. In 2023, more than 110,000 customers worldwide took part in these training courses.\n\n## Customer data protection\n\nRight from the early stages of developing its functions and services, the BMW Group sets out strict requirements for data protection due to the growing IT risks. Any personal data required in the course of contact with our customers are only collected, processed or used to the extent legally permitted and with the active consent of the data subject.\n\nThe BMW Group's responsibility for its products includes the secure transmission of vehicle data to third parties. For example, Group  vehicles  are  not  directly  connected  to  the  Internet,  but communicate  directly  and  exclusively  with  the  BMW  ConnectedDrive back-end facilities via a secure connection within a virtual  private  network.  The  strategy  enables  the  BMW Group  to minimise the risk of unauthorised third parties accessing either the vehicle itself or any of its sensitive data. The access point to the Internet is controlled via a gateway. We currently see this extended vehicle approach in accordance with ISO 20078 as the best solution for offering an outstanding level of data security and data protection and meeting the statutory cybersecurity requirements (e.g. UN R155).\n\n]] \u2197 CarData provides BMW and MINI customers with transparency and sovereignty over the transfer of data to authorised third parties. With the introduction of the service in Germany and Europe in 2017 and the USA in 2020, the BMW Group is fully implementing the current requirements of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (EU GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). The BMW Group deploys state-of-the-art technologies to prevent vehicle theft. The new BMW 5 Series and 7 Series also feature the latest ultrawide-band technology, which further raises the level of vehicle safety.\n\nIn order to ensure the protection of customer data, despite the challenge posed by the growing number of digitalised services, we are constantly  developing  our  data  management  systems and  respond  promptly  to  any  information  received  regarding data protection risks. If customers have any queries regarding the processing of their personal data, they can contact the Customer Interaction Centre or the Data Protection Officer in their respective  market.  With the  aim of  maintaining  our  high  level  of data protection, we regularly check all applications that process customer data to ensure full implementation of all current and appropriate IT security measures. Teams of experts also search specifically for any vulnerabilities in existing applications. We also translate any new findings into binding, Group-wide standards.",

We also report on the management of climate-related opportunities and risks in the chapters \u2197 Outlook and \u2197 Risks and Opportunities .\n\n- [[ The BMW Group is fully committed to the climate protection targets set out in the Paris Agreement. We are taking ambitious steps  to  contribute  to  progressive  decarbonisation,  and  have therefore developed a carbon reduction strategy based on a holistic approach.\n\n## Reducing carbon emissions across the entire value chain\n\n]] The  BMW Group  aims  to  achieve \u2197 Net  zero carbon  emissions across the entire value chain 1 by no later than 2050. This objective is based on decarbonisation targets up to 2030 that were validated in 2021 by the SBTi and are in line with the climate targets set out in the Paris Agreement to limit global warming. Based on this commitment, we are part of the SBTi and the international \u2197 Race to Zero Campaign led by the United Nations.\n\nWe have set ourselves the following decarbonisation targets 2 to be achieved by 2030 (base year 2019 for each scope):\n\nvehicl\n\n- -Decarbonisation by an average of 80% per e produced  at  our  own  plants  and  sites  (Scope  1  and  2) 3 . These targets can be achieved, for example, by reducing our energy requirements and simultaneously increasing the use of renewable energy. 4 \u2197 Carbon emissions of BMW Group locations\n\n- -Decarbonisation in the use phase 5 of the vehicle (Scope 3 downstream 6 ) by an average of more than kilometre driven. To accomplish this target, we are driving the electrification of the entire product portfolio forward and using new, efficiency-enhancing technologies. \u2197  Efficient Dynamics technologies\n- -Decarbonisation  by  an  average  of  more  than  20% 7 per vehicle produced in the supply chain (Scope 3 upstream 8 ). Thus we also have a scientifically approved and confirmed target  for  reducing  carbon  emissions  in  the  supply chain. The use of green electricity 4 as a criterion when awarding contracts to suppliers, a continuously increasing secondary raw materials quota as well as innovations in the production of primary raw materials contribute in particular to achieving the target. \u2197 Carbon emissions in the supply chain\n\nFor the BMW Group, holistic means decarbonising  the emissions generated by its vehicles over their entire life cycle. Although the gradual electrification of the Group's fleet is contributing towards decarbonisation  during  the  use  phase,  emissions  are  also  increasing at the same time, particularly in the supply chain. The main reason for this is the carbon-intensive production of components such as high-voltage batteries. Reducing carbon emissions within the supply chain is therefore one of our main selection criteria when awarding contracts to supplier s. With this strategy, the BMW Group is making a vital contribution to decarbonising the entire life cycle of its products, including energy-intensive raw materials such as steel, light metals and plastics. The approach  also  helps  reduce  carbon  emissions  across  various sectors. \u2197 Carbon emissions in the supply chain\n\nThe BMW Group's decarbonisation targets are part of its integrated  corporate  target  system  and  validated  by  the  Science Based  Targets  initiative  (SBTi).  They  are  being  implemented under the responsibility of the Board of Management in the BMW Group's various departments and thus throughout the organisation \u2197 Performance Indicators and Performance Management . Specific decarbonisation targets are derived from the overarching objectives for each vehicle project, with the aim of achieving substantial improvements from one vehicle generation  to the next. The responsibility for achieving these goals lies with specialist units in the management areas of Development, Purchasing, Supplier Network,  Production  and  Logistics.  Internal  control  and  reporting systems take into account the various stages in the value chain, comprising the supply chain, development, production and the use phase.

In order to achieve this target, we are committed to promoting decarbonisation measures such as the use of green electricity 2 in our own operations and those of our suppliers, without compensation measures being taken into account. The combination of a significant  increase  in  the  sale  of  electrified  vehicles,  efficiency  improvements in all drivetrain technologies and effective measures to reduce carbon emissions in the supply chain are expected to help achieve the targets that have been set.\n\n## [[ Carbon steering\n\n[[ We  reviewed  our  carbon  targets  in  2023,  as  previously  announced. The aim of this process was to set absolute targets for reducing carbon emissions by 2030. The targets are expected to be revalidated in the course of 2024. At the same time, we also improved  the  quality  of  carbon-emissions-related  data  in  our supply chain (Scope 3 upstream) in 2023.

In the year under report, we remained significantly below the legal limit applicable to the BMW Group (128.6 g CO2/km 4 ) by 26.5 g CO2/km, thus continuing the trend seen in recent decades, driven by the electrification of the vehicle fleet and  the  fleet-wide use  of  innovative \u2197 Efficient Dynamics technologies .\n\nThe BMW Group pays close attention to carbon emissions legislation in its various markets. Current developments in the year under report included the adoption of fleet-wide carbon emissions limits in the EU for the years 2030 and 2035 and the publication of draft legislation for GHG fleet-wide consumption targets in the USA for the period from 2027 to 2032. The  statutory framework  for  China's  Zero  Emission  Vehicle  (ZEV)  mandate was amended in the year under review. The amendment covers the  years  2024  to  2025  and increased  the  quota  set  for  the number of zero emissions vehicles. The BMW Group supports the  development  of  harmonised  regulations -  both  nationally and internationally. Comparable specifications in large markets create reliable and predictable framework conditions and make a vital contribution to combating climate change effectively. We provide information on the BMW Group's most important climate policy positions and activities in our \u2197 Climate Commitment Report .\n\n## [[ Making conventional drivetrains more efficient and lowering their emissions\n\n]] the Vehicles powered by modern, efficient internal combustion engines continue to play a major role for our customers. This fact is particularly true in regions where unrestricted access to charging infrastructure is not yet available nationwide . For this reason, the BMW Group will continue to work on improving the already high efficiency of its conventional drivetrains going forward through the use of innovative technologies as part of the Efficient Dynamics technology package. A key component in this respect is the broader use of 48-volt technology. 48-volt recuperation systems use the energy recovered when braking to supply the vehicle's electrical system and generate additional propulsion, thereby reducing fuel consumption and carbon emissions. In Europe, in addition to our all-electric models and plug-in hybrids, we offer numerous new model series that  feature  a  48-volt  recuperation system. Since 2022, our modular engines have been fitted with the second, even more efficient generation of 48 -volt technology. The further development of energy management in BMW Group vehicles, alongside other measures such as switching to highly efficient tyres, is designed to ensure additional efficiency and optimised consumption figures.\n\nRegulatory GHG-based fleet consumption targets were met in the US market during the year under report. 6 In  the  USA, fleet GHG emissions 7 averaged 116.5 g CO2/km for model year (MY) 2023  in  the  Passenger  Cars  category  (MY  2022:  137.3  g CO2/km) and 137.6 g CO2/km (MY 2022: 154.9 g CO)2/km) in the Light Trucks category. Volume-weighted fleet-wide carbon emissions came to 126.5 g CO2/km on average in the USA (MY 2022: 145.9 g CO2/km). 8 The significant year on year reduction in fleet-wide carbon emissions in the US market was driven by an upturn in all-electric vehicle sales in MY 2023. In China, average fleet carbon emissions were 146.4 g CO 2/km 9 in  accordance with the WLTC test cycle (2022: 150.6 g CO2/km WLTC). Thus, we also met the regulatory CAFC fleet-wide consumption requirements applicable during the year under report. 10\n\nThe  BMW Group's  global  fleet-wide  carbon  emissions 11 averaged 185.4 g CO2/km 12 (2022: 193.7 g CO2/km) in the year under  report.  These  figures  correspond  to  a  decrease  of  15.1% compared to the base year 2019 (2019: 218.5 g CO 2/km). As in previous years, when calculating the emissions figure, BMW Group takes into account average fleet-wide carbon emissions (including upstream emissions for fuel and electric charging) in the EU, the USA and China and standardises them in accordance with  the  WLTP.  With  a  share of  more  than  80%  of BMW Group  deliveries,  these  three  core  markets  and  regions form a reliable basis for calculating global carbon fleet emissions.",

In 2023, another highvolume model, the all-electric BMW i5 2 business sedan, went on sale. MINI presented the new all-electric MINI Cooper SE 2 to the public  during  the  year  under  report.  The  Rolls-Royce  brand launched its first all-electric model, the Rolls-Royce Spectre 2 , in 2023.  The  BMW Group  therefore  has  at  least  one  all-electric model in its range for all three premium brands and in all segments. At the end of the reporting period, a total of 20 all -electric models in ten different series were available to order from the BMW Group.\n\n## Demand for all-electric vehicles rising\n\nWith our growing range of all-electric models, we are serving a rapidly increasing level of demand. Deliveries of all-electric cars increased  significantly  again  year  on  year  to  375,716  units (2022: 215,752 units/+74.1%). The share of all-electric vehicles to total deliveries was 14.7%, also significantly higher than in the previous year (2022: 9.0%/+63.3%). Since the 2023 financial year, this key figure has replaced the proportion of electrified vehicles, including PHEV vehicles, which was reported as a key performance indicator up to 2022.\n\nAll type-approved BMW Group internal combustion engine vehicles currently on sale in the EU comply with the latest Euro 6d or Euro  6e  emissions  standards.  The  same  applies  to  non-EU countries as for example Switzerland, Norway, the UK and Iceland, where comparable regulations apply. 1 At the same time, the BMW Group is already preparing for the introduction of the upcoming Euro 7 emissions standard, which is currently undergoing the legislative process and will include for the first time limits for  brake  particle  emissions  and  tyre  abrasion  amongst  other things.\n\n]] The level of nitrogen oxides is a crucial factor for air quality in cities. For this reason, since mid -2018 the BMW Group has been using a highly effective  combination  of  nitrogen  oxide  storage catalytic converters (NSCs)  and  selective catalytic reduction (SCR) systems that include urea injection (AdBlue) in all BMW vehicles  as  well  as  in  the  larger  diesel-powered  MINI  models. The efficiency of exhaust gas aftertreatment has been further increased by the use of an improved oxidation catalyst in combination with a two-stage SCR system. The new technology has been available since 2020 with the revised generation of six -cylinder  diesel  engines  and  is  currently  being  rolled  out  to  other models. There have already been signs of a reduction in NOx pollution in German cities over the last few years. Apart from various measures taken to reduce pollutants, the ongoing renewal of  the  vehicle  fleets  of  all  automobile  manufacturers  has  also contributed to the improvement. \u2197 GRI Index: 305-7\n\nAs of 2025, the Group will take its core BMW brand into a new, consistently all-electric era with the NEUE KLASSE. By the early 2030s, the MINI and Rolls -Royce brands will have an exclusively all-electric product portfolio. The strategy will help to achieve a share of more than 50% of the BMW Group's global sales with all-electric vehicles - depending on certain framework conditions such  as  the  development  of  a  comprehensive  charging  infrastructure by 2030. The BMW Group aims to have delivered more than 10 million all-electric vehicles to customers by 2030.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 2 \u2197 Consumption and Carbon Disclosures.",

In addition to all-electric vehicles, our customers can therefore choose from a wide range of plug-in hybrids and vehicles powered by efficient combustion engines. Our \u2197 flexible production systems and scalable modular vehicle system reflect our rigorous focus on customer needs. With the launch of the new BMW i5 1 , a further model series is now available with all three types of drive system, which previously applied to the BMW X1, BMW X3, BMW 3 Series and the BMW 7 Series.\n\nAt  the  BMW  Group,  customer-oriented  technological  diversity also includes the ongoing development of fuel cell technology. Depending on the segment, we see hydrogen-powered electric vehicles as a potentially key alternative to battery-powered electric mobility and thus as an opportunity to reduce carbon emissions even  more  quickly. \u2197 Hydrogen-powered  pilot fleet operating successfully\n\n## Designing electric vehicle ranges to match user behaviour\n\nThe BMW Group assesses the increase in the electric ranges of its vehicles from various points of view. Our main approach is to optimally adapt vehicle ranges to the respective purpose of use and user behaviour. With this strategy we also take into account the environmental impact, as greater range also means deploying larger and therefore heavier high-voltage batteries. This relationship has an effect on resource consumption and the carbon footprint of the supply chain as well as the vehicle's weight and therefore its electricity consumption.\n\nThe new all-electric MINI Cooper SE 1 , which is mainly designed for urban use, has a customer-focused range of around 400 kilometres (WLTP 2 ). The new BMW i5 1 can achieve a range of up to 582 km in the statutory WLTP test cycle, depending on factors such as equipment and type of motor. With offers such as the BMW eDrive Zone, attractive electricity tariffs for driving, charging equipment, the integration of charging in the vehicle app and increased  ranges,  we  are  helping  drivers  of  plug-in  hybrids  to drive  electrically  as  frequently  and  over  as  long  a  distance  as possible.  For  instance,  the  BMW  X5  Plug-in-Hybrid 1 from  the\n\ncompact segment can cover up to 110 kilometres (WLTP 2 ) solely on battery power.\n\n## Thinking holistically about electric mobility\n\nThe BMW Group's electrified vehicles are characterised by their high efficiency and low consumption. However, the BMW Group has greater aspirations:  its vehicles need to be as eco-friendly as possible, not only during their locally carbon-free use phase, but also in terms of their overall footprint, including the supply chain and production. \u2197 Carbon Emissions Unlike conventional combustion engine-powered vehicles, the environmental impact of battery-powered automobiles lies predominantly in the stream value chain. Where the use of natural raw materials to manufacture battery cells and the carbon -intensive production of batteries make a significant impact.\n\n]] With BMW and MINI Charging, we offer attractive electricity tariffs and  convenient  charging  solutions -  whether  on  the  road,  at home or at work. Customers can use a large number of public charging points via their BMW or MINI charging card and the My BMW and/or MINI app. Digital Charging Solutions GmbH (DCS) provides broad access to various charging networks throughout Europe. DCS is one of Europe's leading providers of digital charging solutions and a joint venture between the BMW Group, Mercedes-Benz and bp.\n\nup-\n\nIt is therefore particularly important to the BMW Group to include environmental and social aspects in the production of components such as electric motors, high-voltage storage systems and battery cells. \u2197 Carbon emissions in the supply chain , \u2197 Social and ecological responsibility .  Other  approaches  to  mitigating  the  environmental impacts include increasing the use of recycling and reusing high voltage storage units from our BEV and PHEV models in an appropriate manner. The BMW Group offers customers who purchase its battery-powered vehicles the option to take back their high-voltage batteries free of charge. The offer also applies to markets where take-back is not mandatory by law.\n\n## Reliable, comprehensive charging opportunities\n\nAn expanded, customer-friendly charging infrastructure will pave the way for the rapid and widespread use of electric mobility. With the adoption of the Alternative Fuels Infrastructure Regulation (AFIR) in 2023, the EU resolved to set up a basic network of both electric charging stations and hydrogen filling stations by the end of 2030. From the BMW Group's point of view, this is a first key step towards providing a customer-friendly charging infrastructure. The BMW Group remains committed to achieving standardised  framework  conditions  and  encourages  offers  that  enable customer-friendly charging on a broad basis.  An expanded, customer-friendly charging infrastructure will pave the way for the rapid and widespread use of electric mobility.",

The aim is to ascertain whether the product is ready for series production and to obtain initial customer feedback. On the one hand, we are focusing on countries where the hydrogen industry is developing positively, for example with the establishment of a filling station network. On the other hand, we are also active in areas where the production of preferably green hydrogen and its distribution  and  use  in  various  applications  are  gaining  in  importance. These areas currently include parts of Europe, Japan, South Korea, China, the USA and the Middle East.\n\nFirstly, the findings from the pilot project are being incorporated into the development of a potential series product. Secondly, we are using them to promote initiatives for the construction of hydrogen filling stations worldwide. In this context, the Alternative Fuel and Infrastructure Regulation (AFIR) will provide new impetus at EU level. Among other things, it provides for the establishment of a basic network of hydrogen filling stations along the main European transport routes.\n\nCharging should be as easy as conventional refuelling and we are working on digital solutions in particular to  meet this demand. Via the Connected Charging app, drivers not only receive up-todate  charging  information,  they  can  also  control  the  charging process at the touch of a button. Customers can use the eRoute function to plan charging stops on long journeys. In 2023, the first BMW models, such as the BMW i7 * and the BMW iX1 * , were equipped with a Plug&Charge function in which both authentication and billing are carried out automatically by connecting the vehicle to the charging system. Using the so-called multi-contract functionality, individual  driving  electricity tariff contracts from various providers can also be stored digitally within the vehicleto facilitate the use of charging stations from different operators.\n\nThe BMW Group also promotes the use of renewable energy. Since 2022, for each charging process conducted via BMW and MINI Charging, the equivalent amount of energy consumed is fed into the power grid as green electricity, which is certified via Energy Attribute Certificates (EACs) as recognised proofs of origin. Moreover, we are working continuously on integrating electric vehicles with their high -voltage storage systems in the public power grid.

At the same time, we are preparing the BMW Group's network to produce next -generation electrified drive systems. For this reason, the Steyr engine manufacturing plant in Austria is to be expanded and the new drive systems will be produced there alongside diesel and petrol engines. Production is scheduled to begin in the course of 2025.\n\nIn line with the 'local for local' principle, the BMW Group's highvoltage battery assembly facilities worldwide are set up close to the Group's vehicle plants with a view to \u2197 increasing the resilience of supply chains .  Production facilities for the sixth generation of the high-voltage  battery  are  being  established  in  Debrecen  (Hungary), Woodruff near Spartanburg (USA), San Luis Potos\u00ed (Mexico) and Shenyang (China).

With the start of production of the BMW i5 1 at the Dingolfing plant and the BMW iX2 1 at the Regensburg plant, the BMW Group has continued to expand the production of all-electric models at its German plants. Production has also started  in  Zhangjiagang  at  the  Spotlight  plant,  a  joint  venture with Great Wall Motors. The site has been manufacturing the all electric MINI for the global market since November 2023. We are therefore currently producing automobiles and motorcycles with electrified  drive  systems  at  15 \u2197 BMW Group locations and  at  two partner plants within our global production network. In 2023, all electric cars rolled off production lines in Dingolfing, Goodwood, Munich, Regensburg, Oxford, Shenyang, at VDL Nedcar 2 in Born, and  in  Zhangjiagang.  Moreover,  all-electric  motorcycles  were manufactured both in Berlin and at our partner plant in Hosur (India).\n\nFrom 2025, the NCAR will feature a vehicle architecture systematically geared to suit electric drive systems.

Production of the allelectric MINI for the global market also began at the Spotlight joint venture plant in China in November 2023. The BMW Brilliance plants in China mainly manufacture for the local market. The BMW Group plants in Araquari (Brazil), Rayong (Thailand) and Chennai (India) primarily serve their respective regional markets and produce BMW and MINI brand models. The same applies to the BMW Group's automotive partner plants in Jakarta (Indonesia),  Cairo  (Egypt),  Kulim  (Malaysia)  and  Chu  Lai  (Vietnam). The Group also awards contracts for the series production of automobiles and motorcycles to external partners (contract  manufacturers).  During  the  period  under  report,  Magna Steyr Fahrzeugtechnik produced both the BMW 5 Series Sedan (up to May 2023) and the BMW Z4 1 in Graz (Austria). VDL Nedcar 2 in Born (the Netherlands) has continued to produce the MINI Convertible  and  the  MINI  Countryman  until  the  beginning  of 2024.\n\nThe BMW Group manufactures BMW motorcycles, components and scooters at its Berlin plant and also at international locations in  Ma-naus (Brazil)  and  Rayong (Thailand),  where motorcycle components are also produced.

        "page_content": "Production and Supplier Network\n\n## CIRCULAR ECONOMY, RESOURCE EFFICIENCY AND RENEWABLE ENERGY\n\n[[ The significance of the circular  economy concept continues to grow against a backdrop of increasingly scarce resources, upward price trends on raw materials markets, geopolitical tensions and the need to meet sustainability targets. For these reasons, the BMW Group is taking further steps to increase the proportion of recycled materials in its products and thus reduce its dependence on primary raw materials. The BMW Group is also continually  enhancing its local supply chains in line with the 'local for local' principle. At all levels of in-house production, we remain committed  to  consistently  conserving  resources,  continuously improving energy efficiency and further reducing carbon emissions.\n\n## Closing material loops\n\nThe BMW Group pursues the strategic aim of reducing the proportion of primary materials in its value chain. An important starting point in this endeavour is to close cycles for certain materials and components. With this objective in mind, the BMW  Group returns selected  production  residues  to  the supplier, enabling those materials to be recovered and reused in a new production process. At the BMW Group, the circular economy principle ('Design for Circularity') is already being implemented as an operational concept in the design of the NEUE KLASSE by the corporate  function  'Total  Vehicle  Development'  and  systematically applied in the development of new vehicle models.\n\nThe BMW Group already uses a certain extent, depending on the vehicle, of recycled and reused materials to manufacture its vehicles. In line with the 'Secondary First' approach, we aim to increase the use of secondary materials going forward, taking both technical feasibility and market availability into account. Within the framework of selected product, material and supplier requirements, we have therefore decided to give preference to secondary materials in our future vehicles. All secondary and primary\n\nmaterials  used  bythe  BMW Group  must  meet  the  same  high standards of quality, safety and reliability. \u2197 GRI Index: 3-3 \u2197 Average distribution of materials in BMW Group vehicles\n\nThe\n\nThe BMW i Vision Circular vehicle is emblematic of our ambitions and made entirely from recycled or renewable raw materials. The NEUE KLASSE is also consistent with this vision in that the components cobalt, lithium and nickel used to produce battery cells will in future contain a certain percentage of secondary materials, thus reducing the volume of primary materials needed and mitigating the associated negative environmental impacts. NEUE KLASSE will also conta in a higher proportion of secondary materials in other material groups such as steel and aluminium.\n\nAt the same time, we promote the recovery of end-of-life vehicles, components and materials in order to retain them in various material cycles as a source of secondary raw material. Together with its national sales companies and importers, the BMW  Group has  already  organised  the  return  of  end-of-life  vehicles  in  32 countries and offers environmentally friendly recycling at more than 2,800 points of return. \u2197 GRI Index: 301-1, 301-3 , \u2197 SASB Index\n\nCompared to primary raw materials, the use of secondary materials also helps reduce carbon emissions - by up to 80% for aluminium and up to 70% for steel to name two examples.  At the same time, potential risks associated with the extraction of primary materials, such as high levels of energy consumption and therefore carbon emissions, long transportation routes, environmental damage and risks arising due to a lack of social standards are being mitigated. As a result, the increased use of secondary materials also promotes resilience throughout the value chain. \u2197 Purchasing and Supplier Network\n\n## From scrap to raw material: the Car2Car funding project\n\nThe Car2Car project focuses on the recycling of aluminium, steel, glass, copper and plastic. Together with representatives of the recycling industry,  raw  materials  processors  and  the  scientific  community,  the BMW Group is leading a project to improve the quality of secondary raw materials obtained from the recycling of end-of-life vehicles. Innovative dismantling and automated sorting processes will enable reusable materials to be extracted to a far greater extent than previously. As part of the funding project, the BMW Group is providing 433 endof-life vehicles. In order to cover a representative range, various models out of the Company's own inventories are being used - from MINI to Rolls-Royce - with combustion engines, plug-in hybrid systems and all-electric drives. ]]\n\n## Investments in resource-friendly technologies\n\nVia the \u2197 BMW i Ventures venture capital fund, the BMW Group invests in fast-growing technology start-ups. One focus of the investment activity is on businesses that can make a strong contribution to achieving carbon neutrality and conserving sources. One example is the Swiss company Bcomp, which the BMW Group has held a share in since 2022. Bcomp uses flax to create structural components made from natural fibre composites as an alternative to plastic composites. By increasing our stake in the US start-up Boston Metal in April 2023, we are scaling up our investment in innovative processes for the manufacture of carbon-reduced steel. In April 2023, BMW i Ventures also acquired a stake in Cyclic Materials, a company developing a recycling  technology  that  extracts  rare  earths  and  base  metals from end-of-life products.\n\n]] The BMW Group is also investing in research and innovation projects  such  as  Circular  Republic  to  implement  closed  material cycles for certain product groups. The joint initiative of the organisation 'UnternehmerTUM' and the BMW Group focuses on the transfer of knowledge between the world of science and companies to promote the circular economy.\n\n[[\n\nre-",

        "page_content": "## [[ Resource management at all BMW Group locations\n\nWithin the BMW Group's global production network, resource efficiency and the control of resource consumption have been integral  parts  in  the  environmental  management  system  for  decades.  Alongside \u2197 Carbon  Emissions ,  the  other  key  indicators  for managing resource efficiency and controlling resource consumption within the BMW Group are \u2197 energy consumption , \u2197 potable water consumption , the amount of \u2197 waste generated and the use of \u2197 VOC solvents. The BMW Group intends to reduce its energy and potable water consumption, waste for disposal, and the amount of solvents used per vehicle produced by 25% in each category by 2030 (base year: 2016).\n\nA steering committee manages the international environmental protection network within the BMW Group. Each individual facility,  area and building is assigned to an internal operator, who, within  their  area,  is  responsible  for  the  technical  systems,  the smooth running of processes and workflows and their environmental impacts. 1\n\nA  certified  environmental  management  system  in  accordance with ISO 14001 has been implemented at all BMW Group production sites. Moreover, all the Group's German plants are certified under the EMAS environmental management system. The BMW Group coordinates its worldwide environmental protection measures relating to imissions, water, waste, qualification standards, environmental management system in a total of five centralised competence centres. Environmental improvements that have proven effective at one location are then implemented at other  locations  to  the  extent  possible.  Regular  further  training courses and the exchange of experiences within the workforce ensure that relevant knowledge is effectively applied throughout the organisation. During the year under report, our proactive environmental management system again made a major contribution to ensuring that there were no significant environmental incidents involving the payment of fines throughout the global production network.\n\n## Water\n\nThe BMW Group also aims to continuously reduce water consumption at its production plants in  order  to  prevent  potential water supply risks. With this point in mind, wastewater from the\n\n]] biodiversity in countries where our renewable raw materials are grown. In Indonesia, for instance, we therefore support local nature conservation initiatives that are dedicated to preserving natural biodiversity via the 'Living Rubber' project. We are also currently analysing biodiversity-related impacts as well as the opportunities and risks in order to develop corresponding targets and the next steps moving forward. \u2197 GRI Index: 304-2\n\npaint shops and washing facilities at the assembly plants is recycled.  Moreover,  slightly  contaminated  water  (so-called  'grey water') is used as process water at the BMW Group's Dadong vehicle plant (Shenyang,  China).  In  regions  where  water  is scarce, the BMW Group ensures that it is used as sparingly as possible. At the BMW manufacturing plant in Chennai, India, for example, rainwater is collected during the monsoon season that covers up to 100% of its water demand. vAt 1.78 m 3 per vehicle produced, \u2197 specific  potable  water consumption 2,3 in  automobile  production was moderately below the previous year's level due to the  higher  production  volume  (2022:  1.90  m 3 /-6.3%). \u2197 Water consumption in detail\n\n## Waste\n\nTo minimise the total volume of waste generated, BMW Group utilises coordinated recycling and processing concepts that are adapted to the specific waste streams at its various plants, regionally applicable statutory regulations and local waste  management  structures.  In  2023,  a  total  of  99.4% 4 (2022: 99.3%) of the waste generated by production was either recycled or recovered. The amount of \u2197 waste for disposal per vehicle produced 5 in the automobile production fell significantly by 22.6% year on year to 2.12 kg (2022: 2.74 kg). The BMW Group intends to maintain its high rates of recycling and recovery as it gradually transitions to electric mobility. \u2197 GRI Index: 306-4, 306-5, \u2197 Waste generation in detail , \u2197 SASB Index\n\n## VOC solvent emissions\n\nThe \u2197 VOC  solvent  emissions  per  vehicle  produced 6,7 fell  again  significantly by 14.8% to 0.52 kg (2022: 0.61 kg) during the year under report. Due to the progress made in the use of solvent-free substances and the constant optimisation of painting processes, we expect to see a further slight decrease in emissions levels in the coming year. \u2197 GRI Index: 305-7\n\n## Biodiversity\n\nThe BMW Group also takes biodiversity into account at its various locations worldwide. It assesses biodiversity in the context of its plants, using a biodiversity indicator as an example within the framework of ecological verification procedures. Based on this assessment, measures to improve these habitats are then proposed accordingly. We are also committed to\n\nthe",

Production accounts for the majority of \u2197 Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions within the BMW Group. As in the past, we  remain  committed  to  energy  efficiency measures, electricity generated in -house from renewable sources, the purchase of green electricity from Power Purchase Agreements and the use of Energy Attribute  Certificates  (e.g. guarantees of origin).\n\nThe remaining emissions 1 are largely attributable to the use of natural gas. In this respect, the BMW Group faces the challenge of replacing natural gas with non-fossil energy sources such as biogas, green hydrogen or green electricity. However, the transition to alternative energy sources depends largely on their availability, the technical retrofitting of the systems and the political framework conditions.\n\nProduction and Supplier Network\n\n6,295,990 MWh; +1.3%). \u2197 Energy consumption in detail , \u2197 GRI Index: 302-1, 302-4\n\n## Renewable energy\n\nAll BMW Group production sites worldwide and the majority of other BMW Group locations use green electricity, which is either generated in-house, procured directly or using Energy Attribute Certificates (e.g. guarantees of origin).\n\nAt present, the BMW Group is unable to entirely cover its energy needs  by  generating  its  own  renewable  energy  and  therefore purchases from renewable sources, for example via power purchase agreements (PPAs). The directly sourced green electricity from defined generation plants is used, for example, to produce the BMW iX 3 and BMW i4 3 models.\n\n## Energy consumption per vehicle produced 4,5\n\nAs a further contribution to protecting the climate, BMW Group finances various climate protection projects outside its  own value chain, equivalent to the amount of Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions remaining in 2023 as well as Scope 3 emissions from the category 'business travel'. 2\n\n\u2197 Contribution to climate protection outside the BMW Group's own value chain\n\n## Energy management and efficiency\n\nThe BMW Group continuously invests in improving the energy efficiency of its worldwide production network. In this context, clear roles - in each case with corresponding responsibilities, targets and reporting obligations - are assigned to central strategy departments, regional management units and plants at local level.\n\nAfter the persistent restrictions put in place due to the coronavirus pandemic and the impact of the war in Ukraine, production volumes increased again significantly in 2023. Due to the associated improvement in plant capacity utilisation, specific energy consumption in automobile production fell to 1.97 MWh per vehicle produced (2022: 2.13 MWh; -7.5%) for the year under report. At 6,380,652 MWh, the total amount of energy consumed by the BMW Group during the period under report was higher than the previous year due to production volume factors (2022:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe BMW Group is pursuing the goal of reducing its dependence on fossil energy sources.

The latter resulted in higher  costs  for  the  BMW Group,  primarily  for  raw  materials, semiconductors, energy and transportation. The overall supply situation also remained challenging in 2023. The supply situation for semiconductors in particular will remain challenging for certain technologies in the current financial year. \u2197 Outlook , \u2197 Risks and Opportunities\n\nNatural disasters pose an additional risk. Extensive flooding in Slovenia led to delivery difficulties during the year under report. The prospect of climate change and the increasing number of extreme weather events are likely to make planning more difficult going forward. However, the BMW Group is able to mitigate the\n\neffects  of  these  unexpected  events  through  its  flexible  supply network and thus largely ensure its ability to deliver vehicles.\n\n## Regional distribution of the BMW Group's purchased\n\n## volumes*\n\nTo  lessen  the  impact  of  the  war  in  Ukraine  on  its  European plants, since 2022 extensive measures have been in place, and therefore continues to source components from western Ukraine. At the same time, our partners have established additional production sites outside Ukraine. As  a  result of these various measures  the  supply  of  wiring  harnesses  to  our  plants  has largely returned to normal. The situation is, however, being monitored continually.\n\n## Expanding resilient supply chains\n\nDuring the year under report, the BMW Group was generally able to rely on the stability of its supply chains, despite the problems caused by geopolitical crises and the availability of critical raw materials. Price increases on global markets also tended to intensify the tense purchasing situation. The BMW Group RiskHub plays a key role in making our global supply chains more resilient. For example, it helps to identify risks at an earlier stage through the use of artificial intelligence (AI). We see the development of the Catena-X digital ecosystem as the key to standardised data transfers throughout our supplier network.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n* Direct and indirect purchasing.\n\n## Risk management in purchasing\n\nAn interconnected risk management system is fundamental for managing the supplier network. It takes preventative action when nominating suppliers, while also reacting quickly in order to identify and analyse impending supply bottlenecks. BMW Group's RiskHub analyses information from external, public-ly available data sources with regard to potential risks such as natural disasters or financial risks. We also employ state-of-theart methods derived from the fields of AI and big data analytics. For selected topics such as the reliable supply of semiconductor components, we also take the locations of sub-suppliers into account when assessing overall risk.\n\n]] In order to avoid cyber risks and deal effectively with an increasing number of supplier-related incidents, the BMW Group continues to rely on supplier certification in accordance with the TISAX automotive  standard.  When  it  comes  to  purchasing  materials both directly and indirectly, TISAX is an integral part of the procurement process and an inherent component of contracts with suppliers that meet the specific relevance criteria. The initiative for joint IT security analyses and the regular exchange of information via a B2B portal also enable us to make the supplier network more resilient.\n\nThe BMW Group follows the principle of procuring vehicle components close to its production sites, wherever possible. We are therefore represented by local purchasing teams in all key markets in order to quickly identify local risks and opportunities and respond flexibly to the respective market conditions. In the face of geostrategic aspects, a resilient strategy for the Group's supply chains  is  also  becoming  increasingly  important  and  the BMW Group takes this fact increasingly into account when selecting its partners.",

The long term supply of critical raw materials required for electric mobility remains a strategic challenge. Measures taken by BMW Group to increase supply security and promote the procurement  of  raw  materials  from  responsible  sources  include, among other things, sourcing lithium and cobalt directly. Furthermore, the BMW Group analyses the development of raw materials prices and hedges against price fluctuations - provided the capital market offers the opportunity to do so. \u2197 Raw materials price risks and opportunities\n\nthe Among other things, the BMW  Group focuses on the conflict minerals tin, tantalum, tungsten and gold (3TG) and uses standardised tools of the Responsi ble Minerals Initiative (RMI) to trace raw materials back to the smelter. We use existing certifications for other raw materials. The BMW  Group is also involved in developing certified standards for critical stages of the value chain, for example as part of the Initiative for Responsible Mining Assurance (IRMA), and is engaged in their implementation by suppliers. Further  details  and  raw  materials  profiles  are  available \u2197 online . \u2197 SASB Index\n\nMoreover, the BMW Group has set itself the goal of generating a positive impact for selected raw materials through our involvement in local development projects. This currently applies to the raw materials lithium, mica, cobalt and natural rubber.\n\n## Purchasing battery cells\n\nAs of 2025, the BMW Group plans to deploy a new  generation of battery cells. Against this backdrop, we have concluded contracts with our partners that guarantee us annual production capacities in Europe, China and the USA. We are strategically establishing supply  chains  for  battery  cells  close  to  our  production  sites, thereby underpinning the 'local for local' approach. During the year under report, we entered into a new partnership in North America to make the battery cell supply chain more resilient.\n\nTo strengthen this resilience even further, we plan to anchor the upstream value chain for critical components in the respective regions while accounting for geopolitical risks and economic efficiency. Through this, the BMW Group also aims to improve its resilience  in  the  face  of  external  events  while  reducing  its  dependence  on  geopolitical  factors  and  its  exposure  to  related risks.\n\nSecondary raw materials will be increasingly deployed to cover the  BMW Group's  cobalt,  lithium and  nickel  requirements,  together with purchased green electricity for the latest generation of battery cells. Contracts and framework agreements have already been concluded with suppliers to this end. This will help further reduce our carbon footprint from the new battery cell in the supply chain compared to the previous generation. \u2197 Carbon emissions in the supply chain\n\n## In-house production as a strategic competitive advantage\n\nThe  BMW  Group  regularly  examines  its  range  of  products  in terms of their profitability and strategic significance. The main focus is being directed at electric mobility, digitalisation and sustainability. In these key areas of transformation, the BMW Group is expanding its in-house expertise on a targeted and long-term basis on matters relating to strategically important components. At the same time, in-house production aims to improve both security of supply and the ability to innovate. The benefits of this approach have already been seen, for example, with the control unit of the hi gh-voltage storage system and scopes of the electric drive equipment. At the same time, we are looking to strengthen our  process  competencies  in  technologies  relevant  for  quality management and enablement within the supplier network.\n\n## Quality assurance\n\nQuality is a promise we make to our customers as well as a decisive competitive advantage and an essential factor for the enduring success of the BMW Group. The quality management system  is  the  basis  for  continuously  improving  the  quality  of  our products,  processes  and  services.  It  consists  of  an  interconnected,  comprehensive  system  that  encompasses  the  entire product development process, industrialisation and series production with respect to both in -house production and the supplier network. The various steps are supported based on need by our teams of quality experts when necessary. The ultimate aim is to ensure - both preventatively and systematically - that all quality requirements are met at all times.\n\n## Innovations\n\nCollaboration with technology partners and the establishment of new networks enables us to implement innovations in our vehicles within a very short time. In this context, we work closely with the \u2197 BMW Startup Garage and \u2197 BMW i Ventures.\n\n]] The specialist teams cooperate in technology clusters to sharpen the focus on innovation screening, which is implemented through strategic supplier dialogue formats (Future Vision DeepDive) and other means . Findings from the supplier network are systematically processed within the technology clusters.\n\nfor\n\nFor the BMW Group, the responsible procurement of raw materials is the result of a holistic approach that takes economic, ecological and social aspects equally into account. Our commitment to upholding environmental and social standards as well as human rights throughout our raw materials supply chains is set out in, among other places, the \u2197 BMW Group Supplier Code of Conduct in which we oblige our Tier 1 suppliers to pass on our requirements to their upstream sub-suppliers. There are also raw-materialsspecific statements such as the \u2197 High Level Commitment sustainable natural rubber .\n\nAnnual risk analyses form the basis for implementing raw-materials-related preventive and remedial measures to reduce environmental and human rights risks. Key levers in this respect are to forgo, substitute or reduce the use of primary raw materials that entail a high level of risk. The BMW Group's secondary raw materials strategy is of vital significance in this context: \u2197 Circular economy, resource efficiency and renewable energy . We also focus in particular on collaborating closely with our partners in the supplier network as well as in multistakeholder initiatives and projects. We use scientific findings to gain an even better understanding of the extraction processes of raw materials and take them into account  accordingly  when  analysing  the  level  of  risk. \u2197 Lithium\n\nStudy\n\n<!-- image -->",

The digital platform enables par tners within value chains to tackle key challenges facing the industry, such as enhancing resilience, meeting sustainability goals and regulatory matters through digital collaboration. After two years of development work, including a significant contribution from the BMW Group as consortium leader, a beta test phase was successfully conducted in 2023. Among other things, pilot projects were carried out in conjunction with BMW component production, providing valuable insights that will serve to promote innovative  data  processing  methods  in  a  production  environment. Catena-X has been in the rollout phase since October 2023.\n\nThe BMW Group views responsible supply chain management as an integral part of good corporate governance The development  of  established  processes  was  continued  throughout  the year under report. The BMW Group's requirements and the expectations it places on its suppliers are set out in the \u2197 BMW Group Supplier Code of Conduct and contractually enshrined as an integral part  of  the  BMW Group's  Terms  and  Conditions  of  Purchase. \u2197 GRI Index: 2-23, 3-3, 407-1, 408-1\n\nThe BMW Group's overarching approach to respecting human rights  and  upholding  social  standards  along  the  entire  value chain is provided in the chapter on \u2197 Compliance and Human Rights .\n\n## Due diligence in the supplier network\n\nOur corporate responsibility for environmental and social standards in the supply chain is institutionalised as part of a multistage due diligence process. We mainly use standardised control procedures to carry out the due diligence obligations incorporated in our business processes. The BMW Group also cooperates with initiatives and associations such as the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA) and Drive Sustainability. In this context, we follow the guidelines developed by the German Automotive Industry Dialogue. We also remain committed to establishing an industry-wide complaints mechanism, among other things.\n\n## -Risk analysis\n\nThe BMW Group monitors and assesses the sustainability risks in its supplier network in business relationships at both potential and active supplier locations. In order to identify and assess abstract environmental and human rights risks, various internal and external data sources such as country- and product-group-specific indicators as well as media analyses at Group and location level are drawn upon. The BMW Group uses standardised sustainability surveys and commissions external on-site audits (assessments) to conduct in-depth risk analyses for its Tier 1 suppliers. Supply chain mapping forms the basis for analysing risks at n-Tier suppliers. The BMW Group continuously endeavours to increase transparency along the entire supply chain. \u2197 GRI Index: 2-24, 308-1, 414-1\n\nThe BMW Group is focusing mainly on component traceability along multistage supply chains, cooperative root cause analysis to combat any potential quality problems and the collection of carbon-emissions-related data in the supply chains. In 2024, efforts will be scaled up with suppliers with the aim of further implementing  and  developing  additional  'use  cases'  as  well  as scaling these for strategic relevant components through the industry network. Another key advancement is the provision of digital  product  passports,  which  contain  product-specific  data  for components such as batteries or even for entire vehicles. Based on information from the n-tier supply chain via Catena-X, data are available in particular regarding origin, material composition and recycling.\n\n## -Prevention and remediation\n\nPrior to signing a contract with the BMW Group, if any risks are identified in the course of the specific risk analysis, our suppliers are required to implement or expand the necessary preventive or remediation and control measures by an agreed target date. Our suppliers are also required to request these from their subcontractors based on their respective risks. The measures, which are queried, validated and evaluated as part of the sourcing process using  the  industry-wide  questionnaire  from \u2197 Drive  Sustainability , serve to minimise potential risks or eliminate existing deficiencies. \u2197 Further  GRI  information , \u2197  Sustainability assessment  of  relevant supplier locations This online assessment is performed for suppliers of production-related goods and services with a contract volume over a certain threshold. Different modules are used depending on  the  size  of  the  company  being  assessed.  Implementation must be successfully completed prior to the start of production. For suppliers of non-production-related goods and services, this procedure is also carried out depending on country - and productgroup-specific  risks.  The  extent  of  the  preventive  measures  is based on the potential risks, the nature and scope of the business activity and the size of the supplier. In addition, we offer training courses on sustainability in the supply chain, some of which  are  mandatory  for  internal  purchasers.  These  trainings also address process partners and suppliers on a voluntary basis.\n\n]]\n\nThe BMW Group has put additional control mechanisms in place for suppliers in high-risk regions or high-risk product groups. Key instruments in this respect are audits of environmental and social standards at supplier locations using cross -industry assessment programmes  provided  by  the  Responsible  Business  Alliance (RBA) and the Responsible Supply Chain Initiative (RSCI) of the VDA. The BMW Group reviewed a total of 95 potential and active supplier  locations  using  this  method  during  the  reporting  year (2022: 49). The BMW Group has set itself the goal that all Tier 1 supplier sites that have been assessed meet the locally applicable statutory requirements for sustainability as well as international  human rights standards (BMW Group minimum requirements). In 2023, 17 of the 19 closure assessments confirmed that  all  cases  of  non-compliance  with  minimum  requirements (priority non-conformities) that were identified in\n\ninitia",

In two cases, the closure assessment carried out was not immediately able to confirm that the agreed measures had been implemented. However, together with the suppliers the BMW Group has now implemented these measures, which will be reviewed by means of a new assessment in 2024. \u2197 GRI Index: 2-24, 308-2, 414-2\n\n## -Effectiveness and complaint mechanisms\n\n## Carbon emissions in the supply chain\n\nThe BMW Group aims to actively promote decarbonisation in its own supply chain and \u2197 reduce carbon emissions along the entire value chain .  For this reason, one of our sourcing criteria requires that suppliers commit to undertaking decarbonisation measures. 1 We specifically enable  our  suppliers  with  online  training  via  the BMW Group Partner Academy and additionally provide face-toface formats for partner workshops at the BMW Group plant in Landshut (Germany) as well as other locations. \u2197 GRI Index: 3-3\n\nInformation on possible violations of the BMW  Group's sustainability requirements in the supplier network can be submitted via the  BMW Group  Human  Rights  Contact  Supply  Chain,  among other options. We also use the standardised RBA Voices complaint mechanism  as  a  complementary  measure.  Moreover, whistle-blower systems are in place to detect and report possible statutory violations. Our aim is to ensure that all substantiated reports of environmental or human rights violations are rectified by agreeing on remediation measures. Further information on whistle-blower systems at the BMW Group can be found in the chapter \u2197 Compliance and Human Rights and on the \u2197 website .\n\nIf necessary, the BMW Group temporarily suspends a given business  relationship  during  efforts  to  mitigate  the  detected  risk. However, the business relationship will only be terminated if no other effective means are available and we are unable to further leverage our ability to exert influence. We end eavour to avoid this latter situation by carefully selecting our suppliers and empowering and working with them to improve their sustainability performance. No existing supplier relationships needed to be terminated due to serious sustainability violations during the year under report. \u2197 GRI Index: 2-24, 3-3, 308-1, 414-1\n\ncurrent upward trend will reverse by 2026 at the latest thanks to the implementation of carbon-reducing measures.\n\n]] [[ We continue to rely on the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) Supply Chain Programme to assess the performance of the supply chain in terms of its decarbonisation. This helps suppliers to define their decarbonisation targets, integrate these into their business processes and report on the actual reductions achieved. Their efforts are linked to a rating from which we derive measures for supplier development and empowerment. In 2023, 282 suppliers took part in the rating (84% of the production -relevant purchasing volume).\n\n]] In 2023, the number of contractual agreements with suppliers that  specified  decarbonisation  measures  rose  to  707  (2022: 468), Including those specifying the use of secondary raw materials, biomaterials and carbon-reduced steel. In our view, however, the use of green electricity has the greatest impact on decarbonising the supply chain 2 . Accordingly, the BMW Group specifies its use by direct suppliers (Tier 1) and for energy -intensive processes in the upstream supply chain (n-Tier) as a criterion for awarding new contracts to supply carbon -intensive components and materials. During the year under report, we concluded agreements of this kind for 676 contracts (2022: 343 contracts). In addition, since mid -2021 the BMW Group has concluded numerous framework agreements with suppliers regarding the use of green electricity. 2 In 2023, the BMW Group had 72 valid  green  electricity  framework  agreements  in  place  with  its largest suppliers (2022: 46). During the year under report, we developed an approach to review suppliers' concepts for the use of green electricity even prior to series production.\n\nFurthermore, we continue to engage an external service provider to carry out annual reviews relating to decarbonisation measures in series production. In the course of 2023, the BMW Group reviewed  compliance  with  contractually  agreed  decarbonisation measures in the supply chain at 72 suppliers (2022: 23). As a result, the BMW Group reduced the volume of carbon emissions generated in the supply chain by around 1.7 million t  CO2e during the reporting period. In 2023, carbon emissions generated in the supply chain and via logistics on behalf of the BMW  Group worldwide averaged 13.9 t  CO2e per vehicle produced (t  CO2e) 3 . As expected, the gradual electrification of the fleet leads to a rise in emissions generated in the supply chain. We assume that the\n\n<!-- image -->",

The basis for this is the vocational training approach that has grown over  the  years,  the  opportunities  to  pursue  a  dual  study  programme and other student development programmes.\n\nSpecifically, we offer young people approximately 30 apprenticeships and 20 dual study programmes at 20 training locations and 20 branches worldwide, in order to prepare them for their future career at the BMW Group. The focus is on the future topics of  electrification,  digitalisation,  automation  and  sustainability. The total number of apprentices, dual study students and partici pants in the young talent  programmes 2 rose  solidly  to  5,007 3 during the reporting year (2022: 4,690/+6.8%). In 2023, the training cohort started at the new production site in Debrecen in Hungary. The BMW Group has now established the successful model of dual vocational traini ng and instruction in nine countries outside of Germany.  We  promote  cross-location networking through the MOVE exchange programme. Apprentices and dual students are given the opportunity to gain practical experience both in Germany and abroad.\n\nIn 2023, a total of 1,200 young people started an apprenticeship or dual study programme at BMW AG (2022: 1,200). The same number of vocational training and study places were advertised for the coming year. In the reporting year, the apprenticeships on offer were expanded to include dual study programmes in Cyber Security and Environmental Protection. BMW  AG continues to offer its apprentices and dual study students permanent employment at the BMW plants and headquarters after they have completed their vocational training. \u2197 GRI Index: 401-1\n\nIn addition to the wide range of vocational training options, the BMW Group also offers programmes for top talents: participants in the 'ProMotion' doctoral programme go on to write their doctoral dissertations in cooperation with the BMW Group and thus contribute valuable innovations to the Company. Our trainee programme AcceleratiON 4 aims to prepare future managers for the tasks that await them in the future.\n\n## Apprentices and participants in future talent programmes 5\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## [[ Attractive employment conditions\n\n]] The BMW Group is one of the most attractive employers worldwide. A positive perception of the Company, challenging and future-oriented tasks, individual opportunities for personal development, attractive remuneration and additional benefits, and a modern working environment contribute to this.\n\n## Employee attrition rate BMW AG 6\n\nin % of workforce size\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

The BMW Group also consistently applies the principles of performance-related compensation. The total salary package consists of a monthly remuneration and a variable component dependent on the Company's overall performance. We also offer additional benefits such as Company pension schemes and an attractive range of mobility benefits, including subsidised tickets for local public transport. For example, the BMW Group subsidises the purchase of the 'Deutschlandticket' for the majority of its scale-wage employees in Germany. Apprentices and dual study students receive the ticket free of charge. \u2197 GRI Index: 2-21, 401-1, 401-2\n\n## Involving employees\n\nThe employees of the BMW Group are one of the most important stakeholder groups for the Company, and are actively involved in shaping  the  future  direction  of the Company. \u2197 Dialogue with Stakeholders\n\nThe BMW Group offers its employees an individual scope of  freedom to organise their work and their working hours. The tools used  include  flexible  working  times,  remote  work,  additional leave  with  corresponding  reductions  in  pay,  sabbaticals,  and temporary or permanent part-time solutions. \u2197 Further GRI information As  part  of  our  'ConnectedWorks'  initiative,  we  advanced the methodological, technical and spatial foundations for flexible and collaborative work in the reporting year.\n\nThe BMW Group measures the general mood in the workforce and the performance of the organisation every two years as par t of a Company-wide employee survey * . This is measured using the 'High Performance Organisation Index' (HPO-I). In the survey in autumn 2023, the participation rate was higher than ever before  at  84%.  At the  same  time,  the  HPO-I  improved  again when compared to the last survey in 2021. 88% of the workforce would recommend the BMW Group as an employer. 86% of employees were convinced by the strategy of integrating sustainability  and  setting  ambitious  targets  in  this  respect.  They  also signalled a high level of willingness and motivation to play an active role in this process, This contributes significantly to the fact that approximately 85% of respondents are optimistic about the future of the BMW Group. The topic of Compliance also scores well among the workforce, with 88% approval. Despite progress compared to the last survey, employees identified room for improvement in the optimisation of processes. The results of the survey will form the basis for concrete measures that are scheduled for implementation by mid-2024.\n\n]] Employees also have a central opportunity to participate through idea management, which allows employees to contribute ideas outside of their area of responsibility. If the proposals have a positive impact on the BMW Group in terms of efficiency or sustainability,  they  will  be  honoured  accordingly.  In  2023,  numerous employees submitted a total of 5,470 ideas (2022: 5,028). At the same time, a total of 1,267 ideas (2022: 1,188) were implemented, resulting  in  first-year  benefits  totalling  \u20ac  52.0  million (2022: \u20ac 20.5 million). More than a fifth of these had their primary impact in the area of sustainability. \u2197 GRI Index: 2-29\n\n## Excellent results in employer rankings\n\nAlso, in 2023, highly regarded employer ratings once again ranked the BMW Group  as  one  of  the  world's  most  attractive  employers:  the BMW Group again achieved the top spot in the Trendence Professionals Barometer for Germany in 2023 for the 12 th time in a row. In the current ranking of the \u2197 World's Most Attractive Employers 2023 of the study provider Universum, the BMW Group moved up to third place worldwide among prospective engineers, directly behind the technology companies Google and Microsoft. The BMW Group is one of the top 15 employers globally among students in the fields of IT and business.",

The different activities at the operating  sites  result  in  extensive  requirements  for  occupational health and safety. The Company is committed to complying with applicable occupational health and safety laws worldwide. The right to health and safety in the workplace is also enshrined in the \u2197 BMW Group's Code on Human Rights and Working Conditions .\n\n]] Nevertheless, we aim to reduce this level, for example, with targeted measures in accordance with our 'Attendance Management Works Agreement' (BAM) and the relevant health management initiatives. BAM is a service provided by the BMW Group to promote the health of employees and increase their attendance. Health-preserving  and  health-promoting  measures  and  offers from the Company are also suggested to employees. The discussions  are  conducted  by  managers  regularly or  as  needed. \u2197 GRI Index: 403-10\n\n## Health management on a holistic basis\n\nthe The BMW Group bundles all measures to maintain health and performance in the 'Health Initiative'. In the reporting year, the focus of health management was on psychological and mental health. We discussed various mental health topics in expert panels in the new 'Health Talks' format. Our 'Health and Leadership' programme also focuses on managers' responsibility for the mental health of our employees.\n\nWe use regular action days, dialogue events and training courses to inform our employees and raise awareness of current healthrelated topics such as nutrition, exercise and fitness, behavioural ergonomics and cancer prevention.\n\n## [[ Sickness rate BMW AG *\n\nTo help promote a balanced diet, BMW AG runs company canteens in Germany. We focus on regional and sustainably produced food. The sustainability criteria used in supplier audits include sustainable water management during production, the use of  renewable energy and compliance with product-group-specific regulations. Since 2023, the 'Sustainable Catering' guidelines  have  also  been  in  place  at  most  international  locations, aimed at further improving the environmental impact of BMW's catering services.\n\nThe BMW Group also applies additional safety standards that go beyond the legal obligations. The digital safety and ergonomic risk  analysis  (SERA)  records  threats  and  sources  of  stress  for production workplaces and production-related areas worldwide. The SERA takes into account the stricter US regulations and requirements in addition to the German legal regulations. In production,  the  use  of  laser  scanners  for  presence  monitoring  in small robot cells serves as another example of increased safety measures.\n\nThe use of management systems and certifications (e.g. Occupational Health and Safety Assessment Series, OHSAS 18001) is aimed at continuously developing internal guidelines for occupational safety and the ergonomic design of the workplace.\n\nResponsibility for the topics of health and occupational safety is enshrined  in  the  Work  Environment,  Group  Safety  and  Group Data Protection division. \u2197 GRI Index: 403-1\n\nIt is important to the BMW Group that all employees have access to the Company's own health services. In Germany, these services focus on providing acute care to employees and temporary employees during working times. At some locations - such as South Africa, Thailand, India and Mexico - health management also involves the provision of basic healthcare. BMW Group's occupational physicians advise employees on individual preventive measures on request. They also help to organise the respective working environment in such a way that health and performance can be maintained over the long term. The  provision  of  occupational  healthcare  and  medical  advice helps to prevent work-related health problems at an early stage and avoid accidents at work. \u2197 GRI Index: 3-3, 401-2, 403-3, 403-6\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe * Number of hours of absence due to paid sick leave divided by the contractually agreed number of working hours.\n\nOne of the ways in which the Company measures the success of health  management is by its sickness  rate,  which  at  3.8%  at BMW AG  was  below  the  previous  year  (2022:  4.2%).  The\n\nsickness rate in Germany remained at a high level until the middle of 2023 and normalised over the course of the year.\n\n]]",

The necessary qualification requirements for occupational safety are determined in coordination with the specialist department for occupational  safety  and  ergonomics.  The  seminar  curriculum  is drawn up in collaboration with safety specialists, Company doctors and the BMW Group Academy.\n\n## Certified occupational health and safety management system\n\nThe  BMW Group  follows  the  globally  recognised  ISO  45001 standard for occupational health and safety. Occupational health and safety management systems are in place at all production sites, and 29 of the 32 plants are certified in accordance with this standard or OHRIS 1 , which is based on ISO 45001. This means that 99.80% 2 (2022: 99.79 %) of employees and 100% (2022: 99.98%) of temporary employees at BMW Group plants work at a site covered by an international occupational health and safety management system. The BMW Group plant in Manaus (Brazil, certification planned for 2024), the contract manufacturing facilities in Born (the Netherlands, production will end in 2024) and the jointly managed Spotlight plant in Zhangjiagang (certification planned for 2024) are not currently certified.\n\nThe BMW Group has set the goal of obtaining certification to one of the aforementioned international standards for all of its plants by 2025. Employer and employee representatives work together at nearly all locations to bring about a continual improvement in health and safety standards. \u2197 GRI Index: 403-1, 403-4, 403-8\n\n## Recognising and avoiding risks\n\nThe BMW Group conducts comprehensive risk and stress analyses in order to identify potential work-related risks in both production and office workplaces. With the Digital Workplace Stress Management (DWSM) project - a fully automated ergonomics assessment - the BMW Group continues to set standards in the automotive industry. Over the last two years, ergonomics specialists  from  the  BMW Group have been training employees in the use of DWSM at all assembly locations in Germany. Preparations have also been made at the locations in Mexico, the UK, the USA and South Africa for the implementation of DWSM.\n\nThe  BMW Group  regularly  assesses  all  methods  and  instruments used within the Company. The results of the assessments are subsequently used to enhance internal norms. The Works Council and, if necessary, the representatives of severely disabled employees and HR management are involved.\n\nThe BMW Group ensures the quality of its processes by means of  annual  internal  audits.  Audits  and  certifications  of  sites  are conducted  by  external  service  providers.  All  necessary  audits were again successfully performed in 2023. The results and resulting measures are made available to all BMW  Group locations. \u2197 GRI Index: 403-2, 403-7\n\n## Accident frequency at a low level\n\nThe BMW Group's preventive measures continue to have an impact. In 2023, these also meant that the accident frequency rate remained at a low level of 2.0 (2022: 1.9 3 ). There were no fatal accidents during the reporting year (2022: no fatal accidents). \u2197 Further GRI Information, \u2197 GRI -Index: 403-9\n\n## [[ Accident frequency rate 4\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Occupational safety along the value chain\n\nCooperation with contractual partners on safety-related aspects at the sites is regulated by way of a separate contractor declaration.

Key principles such as protection against discrimination, equal treatment of all employees and respect at all times are firmly embedded in the \u2197 BMW Group Code of Conduct and the \u2197 BMW Group Code of Human Rights and Working Conditions.\n\nEqual opportunities at the BMW Group are also expressed in a remuneration system that is designed to be independent of gender, religious denomination, origin, age, disability, sexual orientation  or  country-specific  characteristics.  In  the  reporting  year, BMW AG was the first German company to be certified as a Fair Pay Leader by the Fair Pay Innovation Lab (FPI). The certification is evidence that BMW AG's remuneration structures are effective in ensuring equal salaries between women and men.

A key component is web-based training against discrimination in the workplace. This training has been mandatory for all employees in Germany since 2023. From 2024, all BMW Group employees will be offered anti-discrimination  training.  We  have  also  introduced  measures  such  as  the \u2197 Senior  Expert  Programme and  the  Joint  Leadership  Programme, which were used with increasing frequency in 2023. The BMW Group  also  commissioned  an  external  analysis  of  its  existing commitments, with a focus on the dimensions of sexual orientation  and  identity.  This  took  place  within  the  framework  of  our membership with 'PROUT AT WORK', a leading foundation and consultancy  in  Germany  focusing  on  LGBTIQ+3  issues  in  the workplace, aimed at promoting equality for individuals within the queer  community.  We  will  use  this  as  the  basis  for  specific measures in the next step.\n\n]] The established 'Diversity Week' was expanded in 2023 to become  the international  'Days  of  Diversity'  for  the  first  time. Throughout  the  year,  numerous  activities -  such  as  lectures, workshops and interactive events for employees - took place at our locations worldwide, including special events on International Women's Day and the International Days of Cultural  Diversity and  Tolerance.  In  the  reporting  year,  we  also  implemented measures that were adopted in 2022 as part of the revised version of BMW AG's general operating and inclusion agreement for employees with disabilities. Examples of this include our requirements for barrier-free access in the areas of Manufacture and IT. As in previous years, BMW AG in Germany awarded contracts amounting  to  around  \u20ac 42.7 million  (2022:  \u20ac 41.1 million)  in 2023 to workshops staffed by people with disabilities.\n\n]]",

This association advocates for the interests of the LGBTIQ+ community across countries. The spirit of cooperation and dialogue with the internal networks provides the BMW  Group with important impetus and support for the further development of its commitment.\n\n## Increasing the share of women\n\nThe BMW Group is working continuously to increase the share of women in the workforce as a whole, and in management functions, in particular. This remains a challenging task in that it is s till the case that more men go through the process of vocational training, particularly in technical fields, and are, therefore, in the majority on the labour market.\n\nThe  BMW Group  has  set  targets  for  the  percentage  share  of women at all levels of the Company. By 2025, we aim to increase the share of women in the BMW Group workforce as a whole to between 20 and 22% and to between 17 to 19% for BMW AG. We aim to boost the share of women holding management positions  in  the  BMW Group  to  22%  by  2025,  and  to  20%  for BMW AG.\n\n[[ The BMW Group is also aware of the need to achieve a high percentage of women in our future talents programmes. By doing so, we aim to ensure that the share of women in the total workforce and in management positions continues to rise in the future. The proportion remained high in the trainee programme AcceleratiON 4 in 2023 at 41% (2022: 45%).

As such, we not only live up to our own aspirations but also the expectations of society and our stakeholders worldwide. The BMW Group aims to act in a targeted, long-term and effective  manner.  We  also  provide  quick  and  unbureaucratic  assistance in the event of a crisis. We have defined four key topics that are reflected in our projects on the basis of our core business and skill sets:\n\n## -Inclusion for equal opportunities\n\nThe BMW Group is a partner of the \u2197 Intercultural Innovation Hub (IIH) . This platform has emerged from our long-standing partnership with the UN Alliance of Civilizations and supports selected organisations around the world that are engaged in concrete projects promoting  intercultural  dialogue,  peace  and  diversity,  among other initiatives. For this purpose, they receive support for over a year in the form of expertise, networking opportunities and financial resources. The \u2197 currently funded projects were honoured at an event in Berlin in May 2023.\n\nWe also contribute,  for  example,  by  supporting  the \u2197 JOBLINGE programme. The initiative helps people with a difficult start in life to begin their professional lives.\n\n## -Responsible Leadership for sustainable development\n\nThe BMW Group wants to support  and  bring  together  people who are committed to societal needs. The annual One Young World  Summit  represents  an  international  networking  opportunity. The BMW Group has been sending a delegation of young managers to the global forum for sustainable development since 2016, including in 2023. Selected IIH organisations also had the opportunity to take part in the international event.\n\nTo support young talent, the BMW  Group awards full-time scholarships for the Global Online Master in Business Administration (MBA) at the \u2197 European School of Management and Technology (ESMT) Berlin as part of the \u2197 BMW Group Change Maker Fellowships . In addition,\n\nthe \u2197 BMW Foundation Herbert Quandt expands our network with more than 2,300 Responsible Leaders from over 100 countries on all continents. As an important partner, the independent corporate foundation contributes with its activities to the perception of social responsibility at the BMW Group.\n\n## -Education for future generations\n\nThe BMW Group has been supporting educational projects at its locations worldwide for many years. With \u2197 BRIDGE. We are taking the next step with Educating young people for tomorrow, today - a global and long-term collaboration with UNICEF that started in 2023. The collaboration aims to qualify young people in Brazil, China, India, Mexico  and  South  Africa  for  careers  in  the  mathematical  and technical fields, while also collecting donations for the education of children and adolescents in crisis areas within existing platforms, and with the involvement of international subsidiaries and stakeholders.  The BMW Group is thereby making a long-term contribution to UNICEF's goal of reaching more than ten million children and adolescents through education. By undertaking this commitment, we are simultaneously implementing our corporate citizenship strategy at the local level, for example, through mentoring and internship opportunities directly at our locations.\n\n## -Culture and Sports for a united world\n\nThe BMW Group supports numerous sports and cultural activities  worldwide.  For  example,  the  'Opera  for  All'  initiative  provides free access to opera and classical music in Munich, Berlin, Melbourne and London. In the context of our sports sponsorships, we also contribute, for example, through the scholarship programme of the \u2197 Evans Scholars Foundation in  conjunction  with the BMW Championships golf tournament.\n\n## Valuing and supporting employee commitment\n\nThe BMW Group promotes and encourages employees to support social issues around the world in various ways through its SOCIAL DRIVE initiative. The first pillar is the annual BMW  Group AWARD for social commitment, which has recognised the outstanding commitment of individual employees for 12 years. Of the ten finalists in 2023, four emerged as winners  - one of whom also  won  the  special  Doppelfeld  Foundation  prize.  The  prize money of \u20ac 10,000 each will be used to fund the relevant charity projects.  The  second  pillar  is  the  SOCIAL  DRIVE  IT  platform, which  informs  employees  about  specific  support  needs.  The platform  launched  in  Germany  in  2022  and  is  currently  being rolled out internationally. With our employees' help, we can also provide more comprehensive support for existing projects, for example  through  volunteer  work  and  monetary  donations.  The third  pillar  is  the  SOCIAL  DRIVE  DAYS, which are intended to strengthen our employees' interest in social commitment.\n\n## Corporate citizenship with impact\n\nThe BMW Group's expenditure within the strategic focus areas in 2023 totalled \u20ac 44.2 million (2022: \u20ac 38.7 million). This includes donations for those affected by earthquakes in Turkey, Syria and China, as well as fires in Hawaii and the floods in Italy. Beyond financial support, the BMW Group also provides assistance in the form of knowledge transfer, networking opportunities, projects to promote public infrastructure, and the engagement of its own workforce. We also generate additional societal impact  through  memberships  in  associations  and  institutions, the provision of vehicles,  including  for  vocational  schools,  and participation  in  projects  aimed  at  promoting  more  sustainable mobility in cities. \u2197 Shaping the future of mobility In doing so, we aim to contribute as corporate citizens and play our part in addressing major future questions and challenges. ]]",

No further devaluations against the euro and US dollar are therefore expected at present.\n\nThe growth rate in the USA is expected to slow to 1.8% in 2024. Higher interest rates are burdening companies  and  private households in that country as well, while continually low unemployment levels are supporting the economy.\n\nThe outlook and \u2197 Risks and opportunities of  the  BMW Group presented in this report reflect the expected development in 2024 from  the  perspective  of  Group  management.  In  line  with  the Group's performance management, the outlook covers a period of one year. Short-term risks and opportunities are managed on the basis of a two -year assessment period. In addition, we report on medium- and long-term risks and opportunities arising in connection with climate change.\n\nThe continuous forecasting process applied within BMW Group ensures that it is constantly ready to take advantage of opportunities as they arise, but also to react appropriately to any unexpected risks. The principal \u2197 Risks and Opportunities are described in detail in the section of the same name and concern all performance indicators. Actual outcomes may, however, deviate from the outlook due to unexpected events.\n\n## Economic outlook\n\nThe International  Monetary  Fund  anticipates  global  growth  of 3.1% in 2024.  Geopolitical conflicts and the effects of tighter monetary policy in many countries will be the greatest burdens on the global economy in 2024. Higher interest rates are affecting consumer spending and investment, with a corresponding effect on the economy. Further information on political and global economic risks is also available in the \u2197 Risks and Opportunities section.\n\nthe Growth is expected to reach 4.6% in China, where continued upheaval in the real estate sector and the resulting drop in consumer confidence are dampening expectations.\n\n## International automobile markets\n\nThe  Japanese  economy  is  expected  to  see  slower  growth  in 2024 than in the previous year (+0.8%).\n\n## Currency markets and international interest rate environment\n\nCurrencies of particular importance for the international operations  of  the  BMW Group  are  the  Chinese  renminbi,  the  British pound, the US dollar, the Japanese yen and the South Korean won.\n\nIt is expected that inflation in the US and in Europe will continue to fall, and the BMW Group therefore does not expect any further interest rate hikes from central banks. Accordingly, the US dollar is expected to move sideways against the euro in 2024, with the pound/euro exchange rate also expected to remain stable.\n\nThe generally stable macroeconomic conditions should allow for slight growth  on  international automobile markets  in (+ 3.9%). Growth is expected to be spread across many markets, particularly the US and China. A higher global supply of new vehicles  is,  however,  expected  to  give  rise  to  increasing  price competition,  which  will  also  have  an  effect  on  prices  for  preowned vehicles.\n\n## International motorcycle markets\n\nThe BMW Group expects the world's motorcycle markets in the 500 cc plus class to remain in line with the previous year overall in 2024. In Europe, market growth is also expected to be in line with last year's level, with a slight decrease forecast in the USA. Economic expectations will influence the motorcycle market in China, while the motorcycle market in Brazil is expected to remain in a stable condition in 2024, as in the previous year.\n\nIt  is  possible that Japan's highly expansionary monetary policy may come to an end in 2024. If it does, the yen would appreciate somewhat  against  the  euro  compared  to  its  current  very  low level.\n\nForecasts  for  the  eurozone  as  a  whole  indicate  slight  growth (+0.6%). France (+0.7%), Italy (+0.5%) and Spain (+1.6%) are expected to meet or outstrip the average for the eurozone. Germany is expected to record at least a slight increase in economic output in 2024 (+0.3%), although the continued modest growth in the global economy is dampening the country's export economy.\n\n2024",

A challenging competit ive environment  and  macroeconomic  and  geopolitical  developments could all have a significant impact on business performance. The close cooperation between our sales network and our production network and our flexible vehicle architecture allow us to respond to even unforeseeable developments effectively. \u2197 Risks and Opportunities\n\n## Assumptions used in the outlook\n\nThe outlook contains forward-looking statements based on the BMW Group's expectations and assessments and may be influenced by unforeseeable events. As a result, actual outcomes can deviate either positively or negatively from the expectations described below due to changes in the political and economic environment as well as other factors.\n\nThe following outlook covers a forecast period of one year and is based on the composition of the BMW Group during that time. The outlook takes account of all information available at the time of  reporting  that  could  have  an  impact  on  the  BMW Group's performance.\n\nThe  expectations  contained  in  the  outlook  are  based on  the BMW Group's forecast for 2024 and reflect its status at the time of preparation of the Group Financial Statements. The basis for the  preparation  of  and  the  principal  assumptions  used  in  the forecasts - which consider the consensual opinions of leading organisations, such as economic research institutes and banks  are set out below. The BMW Group's outlook takes account of these assumptions.\n\nThe war in Ukraine and its potential implications for BMW Group's course of business are also being closely monitored.  All  applicable  restrictions  resulting  from  sanctions  have been factored into the outlook.\n\nIn view of the growing unpredictability of political developments, actual macroeconomic and geopolitical developments in some regions may deviate from expected trends and outcomes. Potential sources of political uncertainty include policies affecting trade and customs tariffs, security developments and a possible worsening of international trade conflicts.\n\nIt is expected that a fall in inflation and stabilised interest rates in many countries will allow for a slight increase in demand in 2024. The number of vehicle deliveries is set to increase slightly against this backdrop and in light of the full availability of new models such  as  the  BMW  7  Series  and  the  BMW  5  Series,  model launches such as the BMW X2 and BMW X3, and the renewal of the MINI product range. Pricing across the product portfolio is expected to remain at prior year's level.\n\nThe BMW Group anticipates an improved situation on the commodity markets in 2024 in light of the downward price trend for precious metals and battery materials in the second half of 2023. The continued rise in all-electric and electrified vehicle numbers does, however, mean that expenditure will remain at a high level. Higher costs for employees are expected in 2024, along with higher costs from the supply chain, owing to high inflation in previous years.\n\nIn  addition,  the  continued  implementation  of  the  electrification and digitalisation strategy will lead to greater research and development  costs  in  2024.  Expenditure  related  to  the  NEUE KLASSE, such as the further development of the sixth generation of battery technology and manufacturing preparations in the production network, will also impact the Group's earnings and result in greater capital expenditure.\n\nThe situation in the Middle East became increasingly volatile at the end of 2023. The conflict between Israel and Palestine is not having a significant effect on the BMW Group's business at present as the Group does not operate directly in that region. However, it must be assumed that the threat posed in the Red Sea by the Houthi militia will cause some logistical challenges in 2024. Our outlook does not account for any further escalation of the situation. The BMW Group is monitoring developments.\n\n## Outlook for the BMW Group - key performance indicators\n\nDeliveries of BMW, MINI and Rolls-Royce brand vehicles in the Automotive segment are expected to rise slightly year-on-year due to a slight increase in demand, full availability of new models and model launches. In this context, the share of all-electric vehicles relative to total deliveries is expected to increase significantly compared to 2023.\n\nAn EBIT margin of between 8 and 10% is forecast for the Automotive segment in 2024. The RoCE for the Automotive segment is also being affected by the increasing investment in electrification and digitalisation, and expected to be between 15 and 20%.\n\nelectric\n\nThe BMW Group expects to achieve its target of slightly reducing the carbon emissions generated by its EU new vehicle fleet by further improving the overall fuel consumption of its products and deploying an increasing number of vehicles with drivetrain systems. It is therefore expected that we will continue to remain significantly under the legal limits.\n\nA  moderate  reduction  is  expected  in  carbon  emissions  from BMW Group plants per vehicle produced (Scope 1 and 2) due to increased production volumes and BMW making greater use of green energy.\n\nth",

The EBIT margin is expected to be between 8% and 10% and the segment RoCE between 21% and 26%.\n\nThe RoE in the Financial Services segment is predicted to finish between 14% and 17%. As expected, the supply of and demand for pre-owned vehicles is continuing to stabilise. It is therefore to be expected that revenues  from remarketing lease returns will fall further as compared to 2023.\n\nGroup profit before tax will decrease slightly. As the BMW Group continues to take a leading role among its competitors in the digitalisation and electrification of the vehicle fleet and intends to strengthen this position,  expenses associated with future projects will remain high in the Automotive segment in 2024. The production network will also be expanded in 2024 in connection with the NEUE KLASSE. The decrease in the financial services business will also contribute to the fall in Group profit before tax.\n\nThe aforementioned targets are to be met with a slight growth in the size of the workforce. Likewise, the share of women in management positions in  the  BMW Group  is  expected  to  increase slightly.\n\nThe BMW Group's actual business performance may also deviate from current expectations due to the risks and opportunities discussed below in the \u2197 Risks and Opportunities section.\n\n## BMW Group key performance indicators\n\n|                                                          |           | 2023  Reported   | 2024  Outlook        |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|-----------|------------------|----------------------|\n| GROUP                                                    |           |                  |                      |\n| Profit before tax                                        | \u20ac million | 17,096           | Slight decrease      |\n| Workforce at year-end                                    |           | 154,950          | Slight increase      |\n| Share of women in management positions in the BMW Group  | %         | 20.8             | Slight increase      |\n| AUTOMOTIVE SEGMENT                                       |           |                  |                      |\n| EBIT margin                                              | %         | 9.8              | Between 8 and 10     |\n| Return on capital employed (RoCE)                        | %         | 20.2             | Between 15 and 20    |\n| Deliveries                                               | units     | 2,554,183        | Slight increase      |\n| Share of all-electric vehicles in deliveries             | %         | 14.7             | Significant increase |\n| CO2 emissions EU new vehicle fleet 1,2                   | g/km      | 102.1            | Slight reduction     |\n| CO2 emissions BMW Group locations per vehicle produced 3 | tons      | 0.28             | Moderate reduction   |\n| MOTORCYCLES SEGMENT                                      |           |                  |                      |\n| EBIT margin                                              | %         | 8.1              | Between 8 and 10     |\n| Return on capital employed (RoCE)                        | %         | 22.1             | Between 21 and 26    |\n| Deliveries                                               | units     | 209,066          | Slight increase      |\n| FINANCIAL SERVICES SEGMENT                               |           |                  |                      |\n| Return on equity (RoE)                                   | %         | 17.2             | Between 14 and 17    |\n\n- 1 EU-27 countries including Norway and Iceland; with effect from 2021, values are calculated on a converted basis in line with WLTP (Worldwide Harmonised Light Vehicles Test Procedure). 2 Including an allowance for eco-innovations (amounts of minor significance).",

The  key  elements  of  the  risk  management  processes  and  an  appropriate  risk  culture  are  embedded  in  the BMW Group's core values, the Group's extensive rules and regulations on risk management and in its overall risk strategy. Furthermore, the BMW Group's risk management strategy is continually being refined in order to reflect new findings and requirements. Training programmes and informational events are regularly conducted throughout the BMW Group, particularly within the risk management network.\n\nThe risk  management  process  is  applicable  across  the  entire Group and comprises the early identification, analysis and evaluation of risks, the use of appropriate risk management tools and the monitoring and assessment of the measures taken. If no specific reference is made, risks and opportunities relate to the Automotive segment.\n\n## Risk Evaluation\n\nThe BMW Group uses standardised, suitable methods for measuring all short-term risks, reputational risks and medium to longterm climate-related risks.\n\n## Short-term risks\n\nRisks relating to the current and subsequent financial year are shown  in  the  section \u2197 Material  Short-Term  Risks  and  Opportunities .

        "page_content": "Risks and Opportunities\n\nRisks are classified according to the risk amount (average earnings impact, taking into account the probability of occurrence). The earnings impact may be significantly higher if the risk actually materialises (worst-case scenario, confidence level: 99%).\n\nThe impact of  risks  and  opportunities  is  presented  separately without offsetting against each other.\n\nof\n\nGroup-wide effects and trends can be identified by aggregating all material short-term risks at Group level. For this purpose, the potential earnings impact of the risks is aggregated, taking correlation effects into account. In order to assess the risk-bearing capacity of the BMW Group, the aggregated amount of risks is compared with the risk cover amount (the equity BMW Group recognised for accounting purposes). A limit system for various risks helps monitor the risk-bearing capacity.\n\n## Reputational risks\n\n## Climate-related risks\n\nthe Risks associated with climate change are presented in the section \u2197 Climate-Related Risks and Opportunities . Climate-related risks are evaluated as physical and transitory risks in accordance with the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). Transitory risks arise from the transition to a low-carbon economy and are evaluated with the help of climate-related  risk  drivers  and  qualitative  expert  assessments. Physical risks arise due to climate change and are evaluated using external data on potential natural hazards. Potential shortterm impacts of climate change are already included in the short term risks. All short-term risks are evaluated for their climate impact. If a risk is categorised as climate-relevant, the climate-related portion of the risk is determined. The potential development of  climate-related  risks  is  evaluated  for  two  reporting  periods (medium-term  until  2035  and  long-term  until  2050)  and  for three global warming scenarios.\n\n## Non-financial risks as reported in the non-financial statement (NFS)\n\nAlongside the maintenance of a comprehensive system of risk management, sustainability constitutes a core strategic principle of the BMW Group. Risks resulting from sustainability issues are generally identified via the Group-wide risk management network.\n\nQuite apart from the financial consequences, risks can also have an impact on the BMW Group's reputation. For these purposes, the BMW Group assesses all material risks with regard to their impact on its reputation using a scoring model. Moreover, other overarching  topics  are  monitored  by  means  of  regular  media analysis. Any material reputational repercussions are described in the section \u2197 Material Short-Term Risks and Opportunities .\n\nIn  accordance  with  \u00a7 289c  of  the  German  Commercial  Code (HGB), risks that could have an impact on the non-financial aspects referred to in the relevant legislation are reviewed as part of the reporting process. Material risks in this context are defined as those stemming from business activities, business relationships  and  products  and  services  provided  by  the  BMW Group that are highly likely to have a seriously adverse impact. No material non-financial risks were identified during the reporting year.\n\n## Opportunity management\n\nIdentifying opportunities is an integral part of the BMW Group's strategic planning process. The Group's range of products and services is continually reviewed on the basis of these analyses.\n\nThe continuous monitoring of key business processes and strict cost controls are also essential factors for ensuring high levels of profitability and returns on capital employed.\n\nThe importance of short-term opportunities for the BMW Group is classified on a qualitative basis in the categories 'material' and 'immaterial'. Probable measures aimed at increasing profitability are already incorporated in the outlook.\n\nClimate-related opportunities are identified progressively as part of the strategy develop ment process and described in the section \u2197 Climate-Related Risks and Opportunities .",

A prolonged war between Russia and Ukraine as well as further escalation of the conflict in the Middle East could also significantly strain the global economy. The present fragility of the Chinese economy poses an extra risk to sales.\n\nOn balance, neither the Board of Management nor the Supervisory Board see any threat to the BMW Group's status as a going concern at the balance sheet date or at the date on which the Group Financial Statements were drawn up. As in the previous year, the current set of risks to the BMW  Group are considered to be manageable. All risks and opportunities that are expected to materialise have already been addressed in the Outlook Report as well as in the long-term corporate planning and are accordingly not included in the risk and opportunity assessment below. Liquidity requirements are currently covered by existing liquidity as well as the various financing instruments available.\n\nThe following sections illustrate potential future developments or events that could result in a negative (risk) or a positive (opportunity) deviation from the outlook for 2024 and 2025 and indicate their significance to the BMW Group.\n\nIn addition, unforeseen events could affect business operations and hence the BMW Group's results of operations, financial position and net assets as well as its reputation.\n\nThe  following  overview  provides  a  summary  of  the  material short-term risks and opportunities:\n\n|                                                      | Risks                             | Risks                          | Opportunities   | Opportunities                  |\n|------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------|-----------------|--------------------------------|\n|                                                      | Classification  of the risk level | Change compared  to prior year | Classification  | Change compared  to prior year |\n| Macroeconomic risks and opportunities                | High                              | -                              | Immaterial      | -                              |\n| Strategic and sector\u00adspecific risks and opportunities |                                   |                                |                 |                                |\n| Changes in legislation and regulatory requirements   | High                              | -                              | Immaterial      | -                              |\n| Market developments                                  | High                              | -                              | Immaterial      | -                              |\n| Risks and opportunities relating to operations       |                                   |                                |                 |                                |\n| Production and technology                            | High                              | -                              | Immaterial      | -                              |\n| Purchasing                                           | High                              | -                              | Immaterial      | -                              |\n| Sales network                                        | Low                               | -                              | Immaterial      | -                              |\n| Information security, data protection and IT         | High                              | -                              | Immaterial      | -                              |\n| Financial risks and opportunities                    |                                   |                                |                 |                                |\n| Foreign currencies                                   | High                              | Increased                      | Material        | -                              |\n| Raw materials                                        | Medium                            | Decreased                      | Material        | -                              |\n| Liquidity                                            | Low                               | -                              | -               | -                              |\n| Other financial risks                                | Medium                            | -                              | Immaterial      | -                              |\n| Pension obligations                                  | Medium                            | -                              | Material        | -                              |\n| Legal risks                                          | Medium                            | -                              | -               | -                              |",

        "page_content": "Risks and Opportunities\n\nThe following ranges apply for the purpose of classifying the risk amount for material short-term risks:\n\n| Class   | Risk amount           |\n|---------|-----------------------|\n| Low     | \u20ac 0-200 million       |\n| Medium  | > \u20ac 200-1,000 million |\n| High    | > \u20ac 1,000 million     |\n\nDue to the particular features of  the  business  model,  material risks  and  opportunities  relating  to  the  Financial  Services  segment are presented separately in the section \u2197 Risk management system in the Financial Services segment.\n\n## Macroeconomic risks and opportunities\n\nEconomic conditions have an impact on business performance and hence on the level of earnings generated by the BMW  Group. Unforeseen disruptions  in  global  economic  relations  can  have highly  unpredictable  effects.  The  level  of  risk  continues  to  be classified as high.\n\nWith regard to the war in Ukraine, there is a risk of a further escalation of the conflict and therefore of further sanctions imposed by  Western  countries  on  Russia  as  well  as  possible  countersanctions and/or retaliatory measures by Russia. Withdrawal of US support for Ukraine could have major ramifications for the course of the war.\n\nFurther escalation of the conflict in the Middle East could negatively impact the price of oil, which in turn could lead to rising inflation rates.\n\nIn the trade war between the US and China, the focus is currently shifting from simple tariff increases to further import and export restrictions on specific technologies. This could also lead to less favourable  import  and  export  conditions  for  the  BMW Group. With the recent anti-dumping and anti-subsidy probe launched against China (the EU is examining, among other things, whether subsidies for electric vehicles produced in China lead to distorted competition), the EU is also considering imposing punitive tariffs on the People's Republic, which in turn increases the risk of a trade war between the two parties. An escalation of the conflict\n\ncould  have  negative  consequences  for  trade  between  Europe and China, resulting in both sales risks and risks in the supply chain.\n\nAnother risk is of recession in Europe and the United States. In both regions, interest rates were raised considerably in order to curb inflation. Inflation rates have significantly decreased by this point and the majority of economies have continued to grow despite the interest rate hikes - labour markets have shown particular resilience. However, monetary policy measures such as interest  rate  hikes  often  take  effect  with  some  delay  and  could therefore slow down the economy in 2024, posing a risk to sales. The present fragility of the Chinese economy also represents a risk to sales. If the situation in the real estate sector were to deteriorate further, the potential impacts on the economy would be significantly felt.\n\nThe BMW Group is seeing increasingly stringent vehicle emissions regulations for conventional drive systems. In December 2023, a political deal was reached in the EU on the Euro 7 regulation. Risks may arise from the details of the regulation still to be finalised by the European Commission. In addition to pollutant emissions, brake particle emissions, tyre abrasion and high -voltage battery durability (BEV, PHEV) are also being regulated for the first time. Following the implementation of Euro 7, additional targeted tightening measures are anticipated around 2030.\n\nTo mitigate the effects, sales markets are being monitored on  an ongoing  basis,  and  individual  measures  are  being  defined  by standardised processes and committees.\n\nAt the moment, macroeconomic opportunities that could influence the earnings situation of the BMW Group positively in the long term are rather unlikely to materialise. If significantly more positive economic development were to occur in a market due to stronger fiscal or monetary policy measures, this could certainly have a positive impact.\n\n## Strategic and sector-specific risks and opportunities Changes in legislation and regulatory requirements\n\nThe introduction of more stringent legislation and regulations, particularly regarding emissions, safety and consumer protection as well as regional vehicle-related purchase and usage taxes, poses a significant risk for the automobile industry.\n\nCountry- and sector-specific trade barriers can also be subject to change at short notice. Any tightening up of regulations could necessitate significantly increased investments and costs, influence customer behaviour, and lead to interruptions in supply. The risk is categorised as high.\n\nThe legally required fleet-wide carbon emissions target in the EU has been reduced to 0 g/km for 2035, thus requiring complete electrification  of the  passenger car new vehicle fleet by 2035. Moreover, the European Commission is working on a proposal to determine if and how vehicles powered exclusively by e -fuels can be recognised as zero-emission vehicles. In 2026, a review will take place during which the necessary framework conditions to achieve the zero emissions target in 2035 will be analysed. Risks can arise from the availability of renewable energies, inadequate private and public charging infrastructure as well as limited access to resources for the construction of electric drives. A discussion of consumption values and carbon emissions may have an impact on the Company's reputation.\n\nChanges in trade policies could also have a positive impact on the BMW Group's earnings in the short to medium term. Any reduction in tariff barriers, import restrictions or direct excise duties could result in lower manufacturing costs or enable products and services to be offered to customers at more attractive prices. Opportunities  potentially  arising  from  changes  in  legislation  and regulations are classified as immaterial.\n\n## Market developments\n\nThe  constant  change  in  consumer  preferences  or  an  altered brand perception pose both risks and opportunities. For instance, the BMW Group could be confronted with short-term disruptions in both supply and demand during the transition from conventionally powered vehicles to alternative drive systems. The likelihood of market risks occurring may be categorised as high.\n\nThe sales markets of the BMW Group are constantly monitored in order to minimise risks, meet customer requirements and, at",

Opportunities arising as a result are classified as immaterial.\n\n## Risks and opportunities relating to production and technologies\n\nPlant downtime is the main risk affecting production. Disruptions to production can have various causes, including equipment and tool shortages, supplier bottlenecks, scarcity or shortages of production resources such as gas or electricity, as well as problems with logistics. Furthermore,  IT  disruptions  caused  by  cyberattacks, for example, are playing an increasingly significant role in disruptions to the supply chain and production. Damage to the factory infrastructure, caused by fire or natural events such as hail, storms or heavy rainfall, can lead to production downtime. The risk level for the occurrence of such risks is assessed as high.\n\ntime and, in extreme cases, may lead to the non-admission of a vehicle derivative, sub-market or even a complete market. This, along with a delayed start of production for new models, could lead to sales losses. Numerous control points have been implemented as part of the homologation process in order to identify and mitigate risks.\n\nnon-compliance with sustainability or quality standards. The risk is categorised as high.\n\nDuring the selection of suppliers a standardised assessment of risk criteria is part of the sourcing process.\n\nAn increasing complexity within the supplier network, particularly with sub-suppliers over which the BMW Group has only an indirect influence, as well as a lack of solvency on the part of suppliers, may influence the delivery of supplies to plants. A prevention programme was put in place in order to identify relevant developments early on and define individual measures.\n\nAdditional risks arise from the inflation-related price increases of recent years and the resulting demands from suppliers, which can have a negative impac t on earnings. In addition to price risks, the number of suppliers at risk of insolvency which BMW Group  must  support  to  maintain  supplier  operations  is increasing.\n\nThe rising threat of cyberattacks along the entire value chain affects both the security of supply and the protection of expertise relevant to the BMW Group. In order to optimise the level of information security throughout the entire value and supply chain, the BMW Group requires its suppliers to provide proof of adequate  information  security  certification. \u2197 Purchasing  and  Supplier Network\n\nfor\n\nt\n\nAll BMW Group  plants  have  implemented  measures  for  risk avoidance and reduction. These include, for example, predictive maintenance. The risk of production downtime due to parts supply is reduced via measures related to logistics, purchasing and the use of the production network.\n\nA variety of measures are also being taken to prevent and counteract longer downtimes of manufacturing equipment due to targeted cyberattacks.\n\nPotential natural hazards are already taken into account when selecting  a  site  and  through  the  implementation  of  measures during construction. The risk posed by natural hazards or fire is reduced by the use of on -site fire services and employee training.\n\nRisks resulting from property-related damage and damage due to downtime, as well as transport damage to vehicles already manufactured, are transferred to highly solvent insurance companies. Due to the volatility of the international insurance markets, the BMW Group itself bears significant risks today. This solution  may  become  increasingly  relevant  if  premiums  and  deductibles continue to rise.\n\nPotential short-term changes to the relevant legislation and regulations or changes in their national interpretation by the authorities may jeopardise our ability to receive type approvals in good\n\nProduct recalls can lead to additional costs. The BMW Group establishes appropriate provisions for statutory and non-statutory warranty obligations. It cannot be ruled out, however, that additional costs could be incurred that are either not covered or not fully  covered  by  these  provisions.  Despite  the  deployment  of thorough  quality  assurance  processes,  such  risks  can  always arise if the materials and/or processing procedures used prove insufficient  -  in  some  cases  years  after  a  product  has  been launched. A high number of recalls could also have a negative impact on the BMW Group's reputation. Further information on risks in conjunction with provisions for statutory and non-statutory warranty obligations is provided in \u2197 Note [34] to the Group Financial Statements.\n\nThe BMW Group sees opportunities relating to production processes primarily in the competitive edge gained from mastering new and complex technologies. Given the long lead times involved in developing new products, additional opportunities are not  expected to have  a  significant earnings impact  on  the BMW Group.\n\n## Risks and opportunities relating to purchasing\n\nThe  greatest  risk  relating  to  purchasing  comes  from  supply shortages due to supplier bottlenecks. Production problems at the  supplier  level  could  lead  to  consequences  caused  by  increased expenditure for the BMW Group due to production interruptions and a corresponding reduction in vehicle sales. Supply bottlenecks may also have a negative impact on the reputation of the BMW Group  if customer  demand  cannot  be  met  as expected.\n\nPotential reasons for the failure of suppliers to deliver include the lack of availability of raw materials, energy and other input materials, the occurrence of natural hazards and/or fires, developments in the security situation of a country, IT-related risks and\n\nCost advantages gained by developing local supplier structures near BMW plants in addition to innovative manufacturing technologies could lead to lower material expenses BMW Group. Opportunities arising as a result are classified as immaterial.\n\n## Risks and opportunities relating to the sales network\n\nn order to sell its products and services, the BMW Group operates a global sales network comprising subsidiaries, importers, branches and independent dealerships. The insolvency of dealerships may have a negative impact on global vehicle sales and the range of services available to our customers.\n\nt",

        "page_content": "Risks and Opportunities\n\nOverall, the risks arising from the sales network can be categorised as low.\n\nThe BMW Group continuously strives to align its sales strategies with future trends, prioritising the needs of both prospective and current customers as the focal point of its operations. Opportunities arising as a result are classified as immaterial.\n\n## Information security, data protection and IT\n\nDigitalisation  and automation across all areas of the business and  its  products  offer  a  wide  range  of  opportunities  for  the BMW Group. Especially in the field of artificial intelligence, potential uses as well as risks are evaluated on a continuous basis. At the same time, information technology (IT) requirements regarding the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information are becoming increasingly strict. The threat level has continued to rise over recent years. Increasing geopolitical conflicts also contribute to the rise in cyberattacks. Moreover, legal and regulatory requirements are becoming ever stricter worldwide, which could also necessitate higher investments in hardware and software.\n\nprotection and IT are systematically documented, allocated appropriate measures by the departments concerned and continuously monitored with regard to threat level and risk mitigation. Regular analyses and controls as well as tight security management policies ensure an appropriate level of security.\n\nDepending  on  exchange  rate  fluctuations,  opportunities  may also arise, which means they can be considered material.\n\n## Risks and opportunities relating to raw materials prices\n\nAs a manufacturing company, the BMW Group is subject to price risks, particularly in relation to the raw materials used in vehicle production.\n\nThe analysis of raw materials price risks is based on planned purchases of raw materials and components containing those products. A cash-flow-at-risk model is deployed to measure risks relating to raw materials prices. Price fluctuations for raw materials such as precious metals, non-ferrous metals, raw materials for batteries and steel, and also energy, are hedged using financial derivatives and supply contracts with fixed pricing arrangements.\n\nThe prices of many raw materials continue to be subject to uncertainty  on  commodity markets. Accordingly, the risk amount associated with raw materials prices is classified as medium, but there are also material opportunities. This risk is lower than in the previous year due to the decline in prices of raw materials.\n\n## Liquidity risks\n\nThe major part of the Financial Services segment's credit financing and leasing business is refinanced on capital markets. The risk of restricted access to funds is deemed low.\n\nThe liquidity concept, based on the experience gained during  the global financial crisis, is rigorously adhered to and continuously developed.  In  the  Financial  Services  segment,  the  use  of  the 'matched funding principle' ensures that liquidity risks are generally avoided.\n\nSolvency is assured at all times throughout the BMW Group by adhering to liquidity ratios and using a broadly diversified range of refinancing sources.\n\nThe liquidity  position  is  monitored  continuously  and  managed through the Group-wide planning of financial requirements and funding. Further information on risks in conjunction with financial instruments is provided in \u2197 Note [40] to the Group Financial Statements.\n\nHowever,  despite  continuous  testing  and  preventive  security measures, it is impossible to completely eliminate risks in this area.  All  authorised  persons  are  required  to  treat  information such as confidential business, customer and employee data with great care, use information systems securely and handle risks in a transparent manner. Uniform requirements that apply through out the Group are documented in a comprehensive set of rules and guidelines. A consistently  applied  policy  of  updating  such rules and regulations to the current situation, coupled with regular  communication,  awareness-raising  and  training  measures, form the basis for a high level of security and risk awareness in general.\n\n## Financial risks and risks relating to the use of financial instruments\n\n## Currency risks and opportunities\n\nAs an internationally operating enterprise, the BMW Group conducts business in a variety of currencies, thus giving rise to currency risks and opportunities. A substantial portion of Group revenues, production,  other  purchases  and  funding  occur  outside the eurozone.\n\nIn  view  of  the  higher  incidence  of  observed  attacks,  the  risk amount - despite extensive security measures - is still classified as high.\n\nIn order to protect vehicle functions from manipulation, we have introduced processes such as standardised safety assessments and regular penetration tests. However, risks in this regard can never be fully ruled out due to the high complexity and increasing connectivity.\n\nInformation and data can also be compromised by a lack of risk awareness and inappropriate behaviour. The main direct consequences would be negative effects on Group revenues, disruption in production, or reputational damage. For this reason, the BMW Group has launched an interactive programme to provide regular training for every employee on the correct way to handle dangerous emails.\n\nProtecting information, for example from unauthorised access or misuse, has the highest priority. In conjunction with risk management requirements,  risks  relating  to  information  security,  data\n\nThe BMW Group manages currency risks at both the strategic (medium to long term) and operational level (short to medium term). Over the medium and long term, it is possible to ramp up production or purchase volumes in foreign currency regions (natural hedging). Currency risks are managed in the short to medium term and for operational purposes by means of hedging on financial markets, the primary objective of which is to improve planning reliability for the BMW Group as a whole. Regularly updated cash-flow-at-risk models are used to limit currency risks and identify opportunities. The risk amount associated with currency risks is classified as high. The strengthening of the euro in 2023 has led to an increased level of risk compared to the previous year.\n\n<!-- image -->",

In addition to goods-related restrictions, international trading may  also  involve  personal, country-specific  and  end-use-related  restrictions.  In  particular, non-compliance with applicable EU and US export control regulations  could  result  in  significant  legal  consequences  for  the BMW Group. In light of its strong presence in the USA and China, any intensification of the trade dispute between the two countr ies could be a potential source of additional risk exposure.\n\nPension  obligations  are  chiefly  measured  by  projecting  future payouts, gauged with a current discount rate derived from market yields from top-rated corporate bonds. This discount rate is subject to market fluctuations and therefore influences the level of  pension  obligations  in  terms  of  present  value.  Changes  in other  parameters,  such  as  inflation  rates  and  life  expectancy, also impact the amount as well as the duration of future pension payments. Regulatory requirements may also affect the amount of pension obligations.\n\nThe fluctuation of pension assets reflects the volatility of various asset classes on capital markets. Investments are broadly diversified (interest-bearing securities, equities, real estate and other asset classes).\n\nThe BMW Group works together with banks to ensure that the available liquidity is optimally invested in order to hedge against financial market risks (particularly currency, commodity and interest  rate  risks)  using  derivative  financial  instruments  and  to protect payments made in advance. Counterparty risk denotes the risk that the BMW Group will not receive, or not receive in full, the payments due to it in connection with the investment and hedging transactions referred to above. A value-at-risk model is employed to measure counterparty risk, taking into account the creditworthiness  of  the  banks  and  the  business  volumes  involved.  Risk  is  managed  using  a  limit  system,  which  includes daily monitoring of the extent to which limits are being utilised at the level of the individual counterparties.\n\nThe BMW Group holds equity investments of varying amounts in numerous  entities.  The  recoverability  of  these  investments  is monitored on an ongoing basis as part of a standardised process. However, risks from impairment losses could still arise.\n\nThe risk associated with other financial risks is classified as medium. Potential opportunities resulting from the revaluation of investments are evaluated as immaterial.\n\n## Risks and opportunities relating to pension obligations\n\nFuture pension obligations are financed largely via external pension funds or trust constructs that are legally separate from the BMW Group. Externally managed funds are invested on capital markets in a broadly diversified portfolio with a view to enabling future pension payments to be disbursed out of pension assets. These arrangements greatly reduce the need to fund pension payments  out  of  ongoing  operations.  Fluctuations  in  pension provisions and the related pension assets give rise to risks that may have varying effects due to the differences in accounting standards between IFRS and HGB.\n\nThe risk associated with pension provisions based on IFRS valuations  is  categorised  as  medium.  Material  opportunities  can\n\nReevaluations on the liabilities and assets sides are recognised net of deferred taxes through other comprehensive income and hence directly in equity of the BMW Group (within revenue reserves). Further information on risks in conjunction with pension provisions is provided in \u2197 Note [33] to the Group Financial Statements.\n\n## Legal risks\n\nLike all entities with international operations, the BMW Group is confronted with legal disputes, alleged claims relating in particular to warranty and product liability or intellectual property rights infringements  and  proceedings  initiated  by  government  agencies. Any of these could, amongst other consequences, have an adverse impact on the Group's reputation. Such proceedings are typical for the sector, may result as a consequence of realigning product or purchasing strategies to changed market conditions, or are antitrust related. Particularly in the US market, class action lawsuits and product liability risks can have substantial financial consequences  and  cause  damage  to  the  Group's  reputation. More rigorous application, interpretation of, or changes to, existing regulations could result in a greater number of recalls.\n\nThe level of risk from legal risks is classified as medium.\n\nBMW Group  companies  are  subject  to  governmental  tax  and customs audits in each country where they operate, potentially resulting  in  back  taxes,  retrospective  customs  duties,  interest, penalties and similar payments. Payments of this nature may, for instance, result from the non- recognition of inter-company transfer  prices  in  the  countries  concerned.  Further  substantial  legal risks may emerge from contested interpretations of tax or customs legislation. The findings of the tax audit in the countries are effective  for  the  audit  period  and,  if  applicable,  in  subsequent years. Risk management relating to tax and customs legislation is enshrined in the BMW Group's RMS. In order to minimise material procedural tax and customs risks, the BMW Group has set up a comprehensive Tax Compliance Management System (Tax CMS) that is already being applied in its major entities in Germany, China and, since the end of 2023, Austria, and will be rolled out successively in other major countries.\n\nThe BMW Group recognises appropriate levels of provision for lawsuits and risks. In addition, a part of these risks is insured to an economically reasonable extent. Nevertheless, it cannot be ruled  out  that  damages  may  occur  in  excess  of  the  insured amounts. In accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), the required information is not provided if the BMW Group concludes that disclosure of the information could seriously prejudice the outcome of the relevant legal proceedings.

Further information on this can be found in the chapter \u2197 Compliance and Human Rights .\n\n## Risk management system in the Financial Services segment\n\nRisk management in the Financial Services segment is based on various pillars; namely, the prevailing risk culture, the risk strategy and the defined risk appetite for the various types of risk. In addition  to  this,  there  are  a  wide  range  of  guidelines  in place worldwide that are implemented by the individual companies in the Group.\n\nThe central goal of risk management in the Financial Services segment is the continuous assurance of risk-bearing capacity. Limits are assigned depending on the type of risk. Various value at-risk models are used for this purpose, which are validated at regular intervals. The confidence level used in this model is conservative.  Care  is  always  taken  to  ensure  that  the  coverage amounts based on the equity of the Financial Services segment are sufficient.\n\nRegular stress tests are carried out to support this model. These are  another  indicator  of  potential  risk  management  measures and create a high degree of transparency with regard to extreme, realistic events, particularly in volatile times.\n\nRisk management in the Financial Services segment is based on the requirements of the supervisory authorities, which are implemented  consistently  worldwide.  Climate-related  risks  are  also taken  into  account  and  analysed  at  regular  intervals,  thereby considering a medium-term period in the future. \u2197 Climate-Related Risks and Opportunities",

Furthermore, the credit portfolio is evaluated on an ongoing basis with the aim of determining if any impairment allowances need to be made for financial receivables. This evaluation is based on statistical  methods  and  takes  into  account  the  following  aspects, among others: the  creditworthiness  of  the  customer,  the  customer's payment history and the economic context in the customer's region. The amount allocated to credit risks remains categorised as medium.\n\nThere may be positive effects in the ongoing assessment of the portfolio's creditworthiness that lead to a reduction of the overall risk  and  therefore  constitute  an  opportunity.  The  BMW Group continues to classify potential opportunities in this area as immaterial. In order to take account of the volatile economic environment, parameters within the credit awarding process were reviewed and adjusted to factor in or not accept declining credit ratings.\n\n## Residual value risks and opportunities\n\nResidual value risks are classified as high in terms of their risk level, while residual value opportunities are deemed significant.\n\nThey arise primarily when leased vehicles are sold after they are returned at the end of the leasing period. A negative deviation from the residual value forecast results in a residual value risk, while  a  positive  deviation  represents  a  residual  value  opportunity.\n\nEach lease contract is assigned a forecasted sales value for the vehicle at the end of the lease term. Current market trends are taken into consideration within the routine portfolio evaluation. In addition, the portfolio composition (e.g. by drivetrain type) is analysed on an ongoing basis. Relevant changes and their impacts are incorporated into the portfolio evaluation. The residual value calculation models, as well as the portfolio evaluation models, are continually being refined.\n\n## Interest rate risks\n\nTo a limited degree, interest rate risks are deliberately accepted in  order  to  make  use  of  the  associated  return  potential.  Risks thereby result when there is a partial mismatch between fixed interest rate periods, which means they are rated as low. The associated opportunities are classed as material.\n\n## Operational risks\n\nOperational risks result from any form of ineffective or defective internal processes, systems, external events or human error. The aim is to systematically record and quantify all risks except for those listed in the paragraphs above. Because the risks arise in a wide range of areas of the Company, such as IT security or supplier management, the close dovetailing of these areas is essential and ensures that there is adequate transparency regarding the current risk situation of the entire d ivision. All individual operational risks are recorded in a system and appropriate mititgation measures are implemented. The risk amount is categorised as medium.",

For the medium-term period until 2035, we distinguish between transitory and physical climate risks. For the long term period until 2050, the evaluation focuses on the physical climate risks.\n\n## Climate scenarios\n\nThe BMW Group uses three scenarios to identify and evaluate climate-related risks, which are based on the scenarios of the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).\n\nThese climate scenarios range from a low-emissions scenario with global warming of <+1.5 \u00b0C (Paris Agreement, SSP1-2.6), a medium scenario with warming of an average of +2.5 \u00b0C (middle of the road, SSP2 -4.5) to >+4 \u00b0C (fossil-fuelled development, SSP5-8.5).\n\nThe BMW Group has committed to aligning its business activities with the low-emissions scenario of the Paris Agreement and has consistently  based  its  long-term  corporate  planning  on  this. \u2197 Carbon Emissions\n\n## Transitory climate risks\n\n]] Transitory climate risks arise from the transition to a low-emissions economy across all sectors that is necessary in order to mitigate climate change.

For the BMW Group, this may have a negative impact on deliveries  and the residual value of existing products. In the areas of Production and Purchasing, remanence costs and impairment risks may result from changing processes and equipment.  The digital connectivity between companies and products to support decarbonisation is increasing in order to streamline processes and better manage emissions. Risks for the BMW Group  result from the time delay until such technologies can be used if, for example, some areas of the supply chain cannot provide the relevant  standards and interfaces quickly enough.  Significant technological innovations may make product and production technologies, which are in use or in the pipeline today (from energy storage to recycling), as well as investments in |\n| Market and competition                           | -  -  -  Due to a global focus on sustainable products, energy prices and commodities costs are rising. This has a direct impact on manufacturing costs for the BMW Group and  may go on to affect deliveries. Furthermore, credit and residual value risks in the Financial Services segment may also be impacted.  Existing and new competitors are accelerating the production of electrified vehicles. If products and business models are perceived as being more attractive by customers,  this may have the corresponding impact on deliveries by the BMW Group.  Any serious failure to comply with sustainability or quality standards and providing incorrect information accordingly, could cause disruptions in the supply chain or a shortfall of individual  suppliers to deliver.                                                                                                                                           |\n| Capital and financial market                     | -  -  -  A good ranking in the ESG ratings has a positive effect on the perception of a company on the capital market and has a favourable effect on investment decisions. Investment and  financing decisions by investors or lenders depend on a good ESG rating. Short-term and unforeseeable regulatory changes may reduce the appeal of a company on the capital market and  increase refinancing costs if it is not possible to react to the changes in the regulatory framework in time.  This may impact the credit rating and refinancing costs of the BMW Group.  The short-notice termination of government subsidies to promote low-carbon mobility may reduce the demand for electrified vehicles.  Uneven adjustments of prices for carbon emissions could have a negative impact on the macro- and microeconomic situation of a national economy, causing distortions in the credit risk, for                               |\n| Politics, legal affairs and regulatory framework | -  -  -  Any short-notice tightening of legislation or regulations in the BMW Group's main markets (EU, US, China) may exceed the speed at which BMW Group and its suppliers can respond and pose  risks in terms of delivery volume, costs and residual values.  Production processes must quickly be changed to green energy sources and resource-friendly facilities. The BMW Group already consistently implements known requirements. However,  additional costs may result if additional requirements are announced at short notice.  For suppliers, stricter requirements regarding circular economy, recycling and avoiding the use of resources may lead to higher costs in the short term.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n\n]]",

Potential impacts are grouped into five different levels.\n\nIn the Paris Agreement global warming scenario, the potential transitory risks are deemed the highest over the medium term as a result  of  the  fast-paced,  sometimes  unforeseeable  developments. It cannot be ruled out that more decisive measures will have to be taken globally in the next few years in order to achieve the < +1.5\u00b0C target. For the BMW  Group, this is reflected primarily in the risk dimensions of 'Politics, legal affairs and regulatory framework', as well as 'Market and competition'. Regulatory requirements introduced at short notice may enter into force, which could have an impact on products, production and supply chains. In the 'Market and competition' risk dimension, risks may also increase due to higher demand and the resulting higher prices for select (scarce) raw materials on the one hand and due to rising energy prices on the other.\n\n## [[ Transitory climate risks\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Physical climate risks\n\nIn addition to the transitory risks, the BMW Group also evaluates physical risks. In doing so, the increasing frequency and intensity of  acute  extreme  weather  events,  such  as  heatwaves,  storms and  floods, are taken into account, along with longer-term changes such as in terms of temperature and rainfall.\n\nIn order to measure such risks, we draw on external data that evaluate the development of acute and persistent natural phenomena across the global warming scenarios and across time.\n\nFor the BMW Group, this may result in damage to assets such as buildings, vehicles or parts on the one hand, and on the other hand, such events may lead to downtime at BMW Group sites or at suppliers' sites.\n\n]] Physical climate risks also increase for the BMW Group particularly in the long-term >+4 \u00b0C scenario.

Compliance builds trust in our products and brands and shapes our public image. Compliance means much more to the BMW Group than simply complying with applicable laws and BMW Group directives around the globe. It forms part of our identity, our understanding of leadership and our living culture of integrity. Compliance creates a binding framework for all our business activities worldwide.\n\n## Compliance as a corporate function\n\nCompliance is the managerial responsibility of the Board of Management of BMW AG, executed by creating an appropriate regulatory and supervisory framework, as well as through regular and ad hoc reporting, accompanied by clear communications. This approach is based on the core belief that compliance with applic able laws and related internal regulations is the responsibility of all  employees. As role models, managers are tasked with anchoring compliance culture in their area of responsibility and ensuring compliance r equirements and processes are implemented accordingly. \u2197 GRI Index: 2-23\n\nIn addition to being responsible for the Company-wide Compliance  Management  System, the  Chief  Compliance  Officer  also manages the Group Compliance division and briefs the Board of Management  and  Supervisory  Board  of  BMW AG  at  regular intervals.\n\n## Compliance Management System (CMS)\n\nThe  BMW Group's  Company-wide  Compliance  Management System (CMS) reinforces the culture of compliance and integrity and helps reduce sanction and liability risks, as well as risks arising  from  other  (non-)financial  disadvantages,  such  as  reputational  risks.  The  CMS  focuses  on  adequacy  and  effectiveness and is based on the Prevent, Detect, Respond model, which defines specific preventive, monitoring, control and response measures. Clear assignment of roles and responsibilities is also essential.\n\nThe CMS is tailored to the BMW Group's risk situation and addresses  all  relevant  compliance  topics.  Group-wide,  these  include anti corruption and fraud prevention, anti-money-laundering, antitrust and human rights compliance, export control compliance, data privacy protection and product compliance. In the reporting year, the already established compliance programmes External Workforce Compliance and Compliance for regulate d Financial Services Units were incorporated into the CMS. Responsibility for Data Privacy Protection, Product Compliance, External Workforce Compliance and Compliance for Regulated Financial Services Units outside Group Compliance lies with independent departments. \u2197 GRI Index: 2-27, 205-1, 205-3, 206-1\n\n## Further development of CMS\n\nThe CMS is reviewed on a regular basis and refined as needed. This  primarily  involves  evaluating  strategic  focus  topics,  legal and regulatory requirements and trends, best practices as well as industry standards, all of which are taken into account from a risk  perspective.  The  objective  is  to  consistently  improve  the CMS. The BMW Group is an active member of various associations  and  interest  groups,  including  the  German  Institute  for Compliance e. V. (DICO), at Board level.\n\nDuring the reporting period, a key area of focus was the updating and  further  development  of  the  compliance  regulatory  landscape. This included an update of the \u2197 BMW Group Code of Conduct as the central policy for the BMW  Group's expectations of its employees in terms of compliance with applicable legal provisions and internal regulations. An analysis of the BMW Group's activities to further improve antitrust compliance was also carried out. Further priority areas emerged in the context of export control, due to the war in Ukraine, and in anti-money-laundering efforts, due to the increase in legislative initiatives as well as in anticipation of changes to the business model aiming to intensify direct sales.\n\nOne component of the CMS is the compliance programme Data Privacy Protection, which is the responsibility of the department Group Data Privacy Protection. This is based on the directive Privacy Corporate Rules and the so -called Binding Corporate Rules, which contractually protect the transfer of employee data within the BMW Group. Implementation of the programme is validated through regular reporting by affiliated companies and independent audits carried out by Group Data Privacy Protection.\n\nThe Quality Management department is responsible for Product Compliance as part of the CMS with a focus on preventing infringements of product-related laws and official regulations as well  as  ensuring  compliance  with  directly  associated  requirements for products within the BMW  Group's Automotive and Motorcycles segments. During the reporting year, there was a expansion of the Detect processes in particular, aimed at enhancing  preventive  activities.  This  expansion  was  accompanied  by the implementation of new training and communication formats.",

In the reporting period, External Workforce Compliance was restructured to ensure that the requirements for\n\ncompliant  contracts  for  work  and  labour  are  even  more  firmly rooted in the procurement of services and cooperation with service providers.\n\nThe compliance programme Compliance for Regulated Financial Services Units takes into account the particularities of\n\n## Three-Stage Approach of the Compliance Management System\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nfinancial  services  business  and  the  risks  and  regulations  involved. The specific focus of the programme - in addition to the proper implementation of other compliance topics - is on legislative  and  regulatory  monitoring,  consumer  protection  and  the implementation of financial services supervisory requirements.\n\nthe\n\nThe Financial Services segment has established its own dedicated risk management unit, which works closely with the central Group Compliance function as part of the CMS. On the basis of an annual analysis, it identifies the possible need for adjustments and defines appropriate measures. Group-wide implementation by  the  BMW Group's  financial  services  companies  is  continuously reviewed and reported on to the management of the Financial Services segment on a quarterly basis.\n\nIn  the  Financial  Services  segment, compliance  is  incorporated into the target management process.

All queries and concerns relating to compliance are documented  and  processed  using  a  Group-wide  electronic  case management system.

The  online  training  courses  with  case studies and test questions, repeated every two years, strengthens the compliance culture and reinforces compliant behaviour. More than 95,500 staff and managers worldwide have so far completed the Compliance Essentials training and 51,500 have received the Antitrust Compliance training. This offering is supplemented by target-group-specific classroom training on antitrust compliance as well as online training courses on data privacy and product compliance. \u2197 GRI Index: 205-2\n\n## Digitalisation supports compliance\n\nIT-based compliance systems are used for transparent and efficient documentation, assessment and approval of compliancerelevant matters Group-wide.

Our overall statement on the adequacy and effectiveness of the Internal  Control  and  Risk  Management  System,  including  the CMS, can be found in the section \u2197 Appropriateness and Effectiveness of the Internal Control System and Risk Management System .\n\n## Regular compliance reporting to the Board of Management and Supervisory Board\n\nThe Board of Management and Supervisory Board of BMW AG, the Audit Committee (a committee of the Supervisory Board) and the Company's other executive committees are briefed regularly (at least twice a year), as well as on a case-by-case basis, by the CCO.\n\nas Compliance investigations are carried out when the need arises or ad hoc as part of the Detect function of central Group Compliance.

The requirements for the design and structure of ICS procedures incorporated in accounting and financial reporting processes as well  as  those  used  to  generate  selected  non-financial  information  included  in  the  BMW Group  Report  are  defined  on  a Group-wide basis.\n\nThe ICS for financial reporting has the task of ensuring that significant accounting and financial reporting processes deployed within the BMW Group are both accurate and reliable. The ICS for non-financial reporting focuses primarily on the further development of the processes used to gather data as the basis for reporting the non-financial performance indicators disclosed in the BMW Group Report.\n\nThe ICS is based on the 'three lines' model, including a clear definition of how the various functions are required to interact with one another in order to manage risks. As a component of the second line, the ICS serves as the link between the operating units (first line) and Corporate Audit (third line).\n\nIn principle, the aim of every appropriate and effective ICS is to prevent potential risks in external financial and non-financial reporting or reduce the likelihood of potential risks materialising.\n\nBoth the system itself and the methods applied are subject to continuous improvement, with its functionality  being  assessed on a regular basis. Notwithstanding the measures taken, every control system is subject to inherent limitations, given that it is not possible to prevent all incorrect disclosures or detect them in a timely manner.\n\nRelevant  BMW Group  working  instructions  and  guidelines  for recognising, measuring and allocating items to accounts as well as definitions of non-financial performance indicators are available to all employees via the BMW  Group's intranet system. New reporting standards are assessed for their potential impact on the BMW Group's reporting.\n\nThe principle of segregation of duties is taken into account for all IT systems that are relevant for accounting and financial reporting. ICS requirements are also embedded in the ongoing development of all IT systems used in these areas. Furthermore, the BMW Group deploys data analysis tools to identify and subsequently  eliminate  any  weaknesses  detected  in  its  processes and/or control systems.\n\nResponsibilities for ensuring the appropriateness and effectiveness  of  ICS  procedures  for  accounting  and  financial  reporting processes as well as those relating to non -financial performance indicators are clearly defined in a role -based model and allocated to the relevant line and process managers. They report annually on their assessment of the ICS for accounting and financial reporting  processes  and  the  processes  for  non-financial  performance indicators. The assessment takes into account the results of internal and external audits as well as the results of  continuous monitoring. The results of the assessment are gathered and documented in a centralised IT system. Both the Board of Management and the Audit Committee are informed about the status of the  ICS  on  an  annual  basis.  The  Board  of  Management  and, where  appropriate,  the  Supervisory  Board,  are  promptly  informed in the event of any significant changes to the ICS.",

        "page_content": "## NOTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## PRINCIPLES\n\n## 01 Basis of preparation\n\nThe  consolidated  financial  statements  of  Bayerische  Motoren Werke Aktiengesellschaft (BMW Group Financial Statements or Group Financial Statements) at 31 December 2023 were drawn up in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), as endorsed by the European Union (EU), and the supplementary requirements of \u00a7 315e (1) of the German Commercial Code (HGB). Pursuant to \u00a7 325 HGB, the Group Financial Statements and the Group Management Report are required to  be  submitted  electronically  to  the  operator  of  the  German Company Register and made accessible via that agency's website. Bayerische Motoren Werke Aktiengesellschaft (BMW AG), which has its seat in Germany, Munich, Petuelring 130, is registered in the Commercial Register of the District Court of Munich under the number HRB 42243. BMW AG manufactures automobiles and motorcycles in the premium segment.\n\nThe Group Financial Statements have been drawn up in euros. All amounts are disclosed in millions of euros (\u20ac million) unless stated otherwise.\n\nKey figures presented in this report have been rounded in accordance with standard commercial practise. In certain cases, this may mean that values do not add up exactly to the stated total  and  that  percentages  cannot  be  derived  from  the  values shown.\n\nThe income statement for the BMW Group and segments is presented using the cost of sales method.\n\nIn order to provide a better insight into the results of operations, financial position and net assets of the BMW Group, and going beyond the requirements of IFRS 8 (Operating Segments), the Group Financial Statements also include an income statement and a balance sheet for the Automotive, Motorcycles, Financial Services  and Other  Entities  segments.  The  Group  Cash  Flow Statement is supplemented by a statement of cash flows for the Automotive  and  Financial  Services  segments.  Inter-segment transactions relate primarily to internal sales of products, the provision of funds for Group companies and the related interest. A description of the nature of the business and the major operating activities of the BMW Group's segments is provided in \u2197 note 46 (Explanatory notes to segment information).\n\nApproval for the publication of the Group Financial Statements was granted by the Board of Management on 12 March 2024.\n\n## 02 Group reporting entity and consolidation principles\n\nThe BMW Group Financial Statements include BMW AG and all material subsidiaries over which BMW AG - either directly or indirectly - exercises control. This also includes 62 structured entities,  consisting  of  asset-backed  financing  arrangements  and special purpose funds. In some cases, contractual agreements are in place with the asset -backed securities companies to offset their losses in connection with residual value risks arising from the receivables sold to them.\n\nIn relation to fully consolidated companies, the following changes took  place  in  the  Group  reporting  entity  in  the  financial  year 2023:\n\n|                                     | Germany   |   Foreign |   Total |\n|-------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|---------|\n| Included at 31 December 2022        | 20        |       184 |     204 |\n| Included for the first time in 2023 | -         |        18 |      18 |\n| No longer included in 2023          | -         |        15 |      15 |\n| Included at 31 December 2023        | 20        |       187 |     207 |\n\nAll consolidated subsidiaries have the same year-end as BMW AG with the exception of BMW India Private Ltd. and BMW India Financial Services Private Ltd., whose year-ends are 31 March in  accordance  with  local  legal  requirements.  Interim  financial statements are prepared as at 31 December for the two companies with divergent reporting dates.\n\nWhen assessing whether an investment gives rise to a controlled entity, an associated company, a joint operation or a joint venture, the BMW Group considers contractual arrangements and other circumstances, as well as the structure and legal form of the entity. Discretionary decisions may also be required. If indications exist of a change in the judgement of (joint) control, the BMW Group undertakes a new assessment.",

        "page_content": "An entity is deemed to be controlled if BMW AG - either directly or indirectly - has power over it, is exposed or has rights to variable returns from it and has the ability to influence those returns.\n\nAn entity is classified as an associated company if BMW AG either directly or indirectly - has the ability to exercise significant influence over the entity's operating and financial policies. As a general rule, the Group is assumed to have significant influence if it holds 20% or more of the entity's voting power.\n\nJoint  operations and joint ventures are forms of joint arrangements. Such an arrangement exists when a BMW Group entity jointly carries out activities with a third party on the basis of a contractual agreement.\n\nIn the case of a joint operation, the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to the assets, and obligations for the liabilities, relating to the arrangement. Assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of a joint operation are recognised proportionately in the Group Financial Statements on the basis of the BMW Group entity's rights and obligations (proportionate consolidation). The impact of joint operations on the Group Financial Statements is of minor significance.\n\nThe BMW Group's largest joint operation is Spotlight A utomotive Limited (Spotlight), which has been operated together with the Chinese  automobile  manufacturer  Great  Wall  Motor  Company Limited (Great Wall) since 2019, jointly developing and manufacturing electric vehicles for the MINI and Great Wall brands in China. The BMW Group and Great Wall each hold 50% of the joint operation's equity.\n\nIn the case of a joint venture, the parties which have joint control only have rights to the net assets of the arrangement.\n\nAssociated companies and joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method, with measurement on initial recognition based on acquisition cost.\n\nNotes to the Group Financial Statements\n\nOn 11 February 2022, via its subsidiary BMW Holding B.V., the BMW Group increased its shareholding in the BMW Brilliance Automotive Ltd. (BMW Brilliance) joint venture from 50% to 75% with the acquisition of a further 25% of BMW Brilliance's shares. BMW Brilliance has been fully consolidated in the Group Financial  Statements since that date. With regard to the figures reported for the previous financial year, it should therefore be noted that BMW Brilliance is only included for the relevant part of 2022 (i.e. from 11 February onwards). If BMW Brilliance had been fully included in the Group Financial Statements with effect from 1 January 2022, Group revenues and profit after tax for the financial year 2022 would have amounted to \u20ac 145,521 million and \u20ac 18,842 million respectively. The remeasurement of the previously held shares resulted in a gain of \u20ac 7,649 million on firsttime consolidation, which was recognised in income from investments within the line item 'Other financial result' in the previous year. Detailed information is provided in \u2197 BMW Group Report 2022, note [3] to the Group Financial Statements .\n\nOn 30 September 2021, the BMW Group signed an agreement with the Huachen Group to acquire all of the shares of Brilliance Automobile Manufacturing Co., Ltd., a Huachen Group subsidiary. The transaction will not, however, be completed.\n\nThe other changes to the Group reporting entity do not have a material impact on the results of operations, financial  position and net assets of the Group.\n\n## 03 Other significant events\n\n## Russia-Ukraine war\n\nMajor  uncertainties  remained  at  31  December  2023  with  respect to the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war. The current sanctions and the countermeasures taken significantly  restrict  economic activities with Russia and also have an impact on the Russian companies of the BMW Group.\n\nThe restrictions currently in place for payments continue to restrict the transfer of liquid funds from Russia. Developments in this area are reviewed by the BMW Group on a regular basis. In total, the Russian companies hold around 4% (2022: 5%) of the BMW Group's cash and cash equivalents.\n\nA closing rate of RUB 100.62 (2022: 77.12) to the euro was applied at 31 December 2023 to translate foreign currency items denominated in Russian roubles. The BMW Group has been able to execute transactions at this rate.\n\nOn 19 July 2023, the BMW Group signed an agreement with the companies  of  the  Mercedes-Benz Group  AG,  the  Stellantis Group, the Honda Group, the Hyundai Motor Group and the General Motors Company Group to establish a company in Canada with the aim of developing charging infrastructure in North America. Following approval by the relevant antitrust authorities, the transaction was completed on 18 October 2023, with the BMW Group holding a 16.67% stake. Although this is below 20%, the newly  founded  entity  is  included  in  the  BMW  Group  Financial Statements as an associated company using the equity method, reflecting  the  fact  that  the  BMW  Group  is  represented  on  the management board and therefore has significant influence.\n\nOn 6 November 2023, the BMW Group signed an agreement with the Mercedes-Benz Group AG to establish a company in China with the aim of developing a charging infrastructure there. Approval has been granted by the antitrust authorities. The BMW Group will hold a 50% stake in the newly founded entity. It will be included in the BMW Group Financial Statements as a joint venture using the equity method.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## 04 Foreign currency translation and measurement\n\nThe financial statements of consolidated companies which are presented in a foreign currency are translated using the modified closing rate method. Under this method, assets and liabilities are translated at the closing exchange rate, while income and expenses are translated at the average exchange rate. Differences arising on foreign currency translation are presented in 'Accumulated other equity'. In the single entity accounts of BMW AG and its subsidiaries, foreign currency receivables and payables are measured on initial recognition using the exchange rate prevailing at the date of first -time recognition. Advance payments to suppliers or from customers in a foreign currency that result in the addition of non-monetary assets or liabilities are recorded at the exchange rate prevailing at the date of payment. At the end of  the  reporting  period,  foreign  currency  receivables  and  payables are measured using the closing exchange rate. The resulting unrealised gains and losses, as well as realised gains and losses arising on settlement, are recognised in the income statement, in line with the underlying substance of the transaction. Non-monetary balance sheet line items denominated in foreign currencies are rolled forward on the basis of historical exchange rates.\n\nNotes to the Group Financial Statements\n\nThe exchange rates of currencies which have a material impact on the Group Financial Statements were as follows:\n\n|                            | Closing rate   | Closing rate   | Average rate   | Average rate   |\n|----------------------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|\n| 1 euro =                   | 31.12.2023     | 31.12.2022     | 2023           | 2022           |\n| US dollar                  | 1.11    1.07   |                | 1.08           | 1.05           |\n| Chinese renminbi           | 7.86           | 7.36           | 7.66           | 7.08           |\n| British pound  0.87        |                | 0.89           | 0.87           | 0.85           |\n| Japanese yen  156.58       |                | 141.11         | 151.98         | 138.02         |\n| South Korean won  1,435.44 | 1,346.97       | 1,412.98       |                | 1,357.16       |\n\nArgentina has fulfilled the definition of a hyperinflationary economy since 1 July 2018. Since that date, IAS 29 (Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies) has therefore been applied for the BMW subsidiary in Argentina. The price indices published by the Federaci\u00f3n Argentina de Consejos Profesionales de Ciencias Econ\u00f3micas (FACPCE) are used to adjust non-monetary asset, liability and income statement line items. The resulting effects are not material for the BMW Group.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Standard replaces IFRS 4 and contains new rules relating to the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure requirements for insurance contracts. In a Group-wide project, the BMW Group examined the impact of adopting IFRS 17 for existing agreements. The BMW Group offers various products that meet the definition of an insurance contract in accordance with IFRS 17. However, for the majority of these products, either an exemption applies (e.g. for warranty agreements) or the insurance arrangements qualify as fixed-fee service contracts, which can continue to be accounted for in accordance with IFRS 15 due to the option available in IFRS 17. In some markets, however, products are offered (e.g. comprehensive vehicle insurance) that are required to be accounted for in accordance with IFRS 17. These contracts can be accounted for using the premium allocation approach, which is essentially the same as the accounting method already being applied for such contracts. In the financial year 2023, insurance premiums for insurance contracts amounting to \u20ac 89 million were recognised in other income within the line item 'Revenues'. At 31 December 2023, insurance liabilities for the remaining terms of these contracts amounted to \u20ac 289 million.\n\namendments provide for a temporary exemption from recognising deferred taxes resulting from the implementation of the Pillar Two rules. The exemption has accordingly been applied by the BMW Group. The amendments also include disclosures in the notes to explain the impact of the introduction of minimum taxation on affected entities. The introduction of the Pillar Two regulations  is  not  expected  to  have  any  significant  impact  on  the BMW Group Financial Statements.\n\n## b Financial reporting pronouncements issued by the IASB, but not yet applied\n\nOther financial reporting standards and revised standards issued by the IASB that have not yet been applied are not expected to have any significant impact on the BMW Group Financial Statements.\n\n## c Accounting policy changes in the financial year 2023\n\nIn order to increase consistency between internal performance management and external  reporting,  the  following  accounting policies were changed in the financial year 2023.\n\nIn May 2023, the IASB published International Tax Reform  - Pillar Two Model Rules (Amendments to IAS 12) which sets out a mandatory  exemption  to  the  accounting  for  deferred  taxes  in conjunction with the global minimum taxation (Pillar Two). The\n\nGovernment grants related to assets were previously reported as deferred income and recognised through profit or loss over the accounting  periods  in  which  the  costs  occur  that  they  are  intended to compensate. With effect from the financial year 2023, government grants relating to assets are deducted from the carrying amount of the relevant assets and therefore now recognised in profit or loss over the respective useful lives of the assets\n\nNotes to the Group Financial Statements\n\nin the form of reduced depreciation/amortisation. In this context, the accounting treatment applied for investment tax credits was also changed. Instead of being recognised immediately as a reduction of income tax expense, with effect from the financial year 2023 investment tax credits are also deducted from the carrying amount of the related assets. The income statement impact is therefore also spread over the respective useful lives of the assets in the form of lower depreciation/amortisation expense. The change in accounting policy has not been applied retrospectively on the grounds of immateriality.  Prior-year figures have therefore not been adjusted.\n\nDeferred income for government grants relating to assets at 31 December 2022 amounted to \u20ac 465 million or 0.19% of Group total assets at that date. At 31 December 2023, the corresponding amount was \u20ac 370 million.\n\nAlso with a view to increasing consistency with internal performance management, with effect from the financial year 2023 advance payments to suppliers are reported within other assets. At 31 December 2022, advance payments to suppliers amounting to \u20ac 259 million were reported within inventories. Prior year figures have not been adjusted on the grounds of immateriality.\n\nThe impact of the changes in accounting policy is not material for the results of operations, financial position and net assets of the BMW Group.",

        "page_content": "## 06 Accounting policies, assumptions, judgements and estimations\n\nThe impact of climate change has been taken into account by the Board of Management when preparing the Group Financial Statements. As a matter of principle, the Group Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with the BMW Group's longterm corporate plan, as approved by management, taking into account issues relevant for climate change such as the transformation to electric mobility, regulatory requirements and changes in production conditions. In this context, the BMW Group incurs expenditure on research and development for electrified models, invests in resource-saving production facilities for the manufacture of electrified automobiles and, in particular, is gra dually converting its production processes from fossil fuels to green energy by concluding long-term power purchase agreements for electricity and gas from renewable sources.\n\nAs a consequence of joining the Business Ambition for 1.5\u00b0C campaign led by the Science Based Target initiative (SBTi), the BMW Group pursues validated SBTi Near Term Targets for the year 2030, which are incorporated in the Group's long-term corporate plan.\n\nThe targets set include a reduction in average carbon emissions of  80% per vehicle produced in our own plants and locations (Scope 1 and Scope 2), an average reduction of more than 50% per kilometre driven in the use phase (Scope 3 downstream) and an average reduction of more than 20% per vehicle in the supply chain (Scope 3 upstream).\n\nIn line with the recommendations of the Taskforce for Climaterelated Financial Disclosures (TCFD), both physical and transition-related risks and opportunities are taken into account in the Group's internal performance management system and in conjunction with the preparation of the Group Financial Statements. These aspects, referred to below as 'climate-related aspects',\n\nNotes to the Group Financial Statements\n\nare  highly  relevant  for  the  preparation  of  the  Group  Financial Statements, particularly in the case of assumptions, judgements and estimations relating to future developments that impact the BMW Group and its environment, and are therefore included in their assessment.\n\nMore detailed information on how climate-related  aspects  are taken into account for recognition and measurement purpos es is provided below, particularly in the comments on property, plant and equipment, leased products and the performance of impairment tests. This includes an indication of the extent to which climate-related aspects have been taken into account in the estimations and assumptions for the recognition and measurement of balance sheet items.\n\nRevenues from  customer  contracts  include  in  particular  revenues from the sale of products (primarily new and pre -owned vehicles and related products) as well as revenues from services. Revenue is recognised when control is transferred to the dealership or retail customer. In the case of sales of products, this is usually at the point in time when the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred. Revenues are stated net of settlement discount, bonuses and rebates as well as interest and residual value subsidies.  The  consideration  arising  from  these  sales  usually falls due for payment immediately or within 30 days. In exceptional cases, a longer payment may also be agreed. In the case of services, control is transferred over time. Consideration for the rendering of services to customers usually falls due for payment at the beginning of a contract and is therefore deferred as a contract liability. The deferred amount is released over the service period and recognised as revenue in the income statement. As a rule, amounts are released on the basis of the expected expense trend, as this best reflects the performance of the service. If the sale  of  products  includes  a  determinable amount  for  services (multiple-component  contracts),  the  related  revenues  are  deferred and recognised as income in the same way. Variable consideration components, such as bonuses, are measured at the\n\nexpected value, and in the case of multi-component contracts, allocated to all performance obligations unless directly attributable to the sale of a vehicle.\n\nRevenues from the sale of products, for which repurchase arrangements are in place, are not recognised immediately in full. Instead,  revenues are either  recognised  proportionately  or  the difference between the sales and repurchase price is recognised in instalments over the term of the contract depending on the nature of the agreement. In the case of vehicles sold to a dealership that are expected to be repurchased in a subsequent period as part of leasing operations, revenues are not recognised at Group level at the time of the sale of the vehicle. Instead, assets and liabilities relating based on the right of return of these vehicles are recognised.\n\nRevenues from leases of own-manufactured vehicles are recognised  at  Group  level  in  accordance  with  the  requirements  for manufacturer or dealer leases. In the case of operating leases, revenues from lease payments are recognised on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Finance leases, on the other hand, are accounted for as a sale. At the lease commencement date, revenues are recognised at the amount of the fair value of the leased asset and reduced by any unguaranteed residual value of vehicles that are expected to be returned to the Group at the end of the lease term. In addition, initial direct costs are recognised as cost of sales at the lease commencement date.\n\nRevenues also include interest income from financial services. Interest income arising on finance leases as well as on retail customer and dealership financing is recognised using the effective interest method and reported as  interest income on credit financing within revenues.",

        "page_content": "Public sector grants are not recognised until there is reasonable assurance that the conditions attaching to them have been complied with and the grants will be received. The resulting income is recognised in cost of sales over the periods in which the costs occur that they are intended to compensate. Information on the accounting policy changes applied for the first time from the financial year 2023 relating to government grants received for assets as well as to investment tax credits is provided in \u2197 note 5 .\n\nEarnings per share are calculated as follows: basic earnings per share are calculated for common and preferred stock by dividing the net profit for the year (after non-controlling interests) that is attributable to each category of stock, by the average number of shares of each category in circulation. Net profit for the year is accordingly  allocated  to  the  different  categories  of  stock.  The portion of the net profit that is not being distributed is allocated to each category of stock based on the number of outstanding shares. Profits available for distribution are determined directly on the basis of the dividend proposals or resolutions for common and preferred stock. Diluted earnings per share are calculated and separately disclosed in accordance with IAS 33.\n\nIntangible assets are measured on initial recognition at acquisition or manufacturing cost. Subsequently, intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful lives of between three and 20 years. Impairment losses are recognised where necessary. Intangible assets with indefinite  useful  lives  are  tested  annually  for  impairment.  Internally generated intangible assets mainly comprise development costs for vehicle, module and architecture projects.\n\nNotes to the Group Financial Statements\n\nDevelopment costs are capitalised if all of the criteria specified by IAS 38 are met. They are measured on the basis of direct costs  and  directly  attributable  overhead  costs.  Project-related capitalised development costs are amortised on a straight-line basis following the start of pro duction over the estimated product life (usually five to 12 years).\n\nGoodwill arises when the cost of acquiring a business exceeds the Group's share of the net fair value of the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities identified during the acquisition.\n\nIntangible assets also include emission allowances and similar rights arising from programmes aimed at reducing carbon or other climate-damaging emissions (for example in conjunction with the EU Emissions Trading System or vehicle-related emissions regulations in the USA or China). These allowances and rights are carried at cost and, in the event that they are allocated free of charge, recorded at a value of zero. Amounts are derecognised when they are returned or, in exceptional cases, when they are sold or expire. In parallel to the recognition of these allowances and rights as assets, provisions are recognised in accordance with IAS 37 corresponding to the amount of obligations expected to arise in conjunction with the related emissions regulations. Provisions are measured on the basis of the expected value of the allowances or rights that are to be returned.\n\nIf there is any indication of impairment of intangible assets , or if  an  annual  impairment  test  is  required  (i.e.  intangible  assets with an indefinite useful life, intangible assets during the development phase and goodwill), an impairment test is performed. Each individual asset is tested separately unless the cash flows generated by the asset are not sufficiently independent from the cash flows generated by other assets or other groups of assets.\n\nIn these cases, impairment is tested at the level of a cash -generating unit, which is the norm for the BMW Group.\n\nFor the purpose of the impairment test, the carrying amount of an asset (or a cash-generating unit) is compared with the recoverable amount. The first step of the impairment test is to determine the value in use. If the value in use is lower than the carrying amount, the next step is to determine the fair value less costs to sell and compare the amount so determined with the asset's carrying amount. If the fair value is lower than the carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognised, reducing the carrying amount to the higher of the asset's value in use or fair value less costs to sell.\n\nIf  the  reason  for  a  previously  recognised  impairment  loss  no longer exists, the impairment loss is reversed up to the level of the recoverable amount, but no higher than the amortised acquisition or manufacturing cost. Impairment losses on goodwill are not reversed. As part of the process of assessing recoverability, it is generally necessary to apply estimations and assumptions  in particular regarding future cash inflows and outflows and the length  of  the  forecast  period -  which  could  differ  from  actual amounts. Actual amounts may differ from the assumptions and estimations  used  if  business  conditions  develop  differently  to expectations.\n\nThe BMW Group determines the value in use of intangib le assets on the basis of a present value computation. The cash flows used for this calculation are derived from the long- term corporate plan approved by management, corresponding to a forecast period of six years.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "Notes to the Group Financial Statements\n\nThe following pre-tax discount factors were applied:\n\n|   2023 |   2022 | in %                                |\n|--------|--------|-------------------------------------|\n|   13.7 |   12.4 | Automotive excluding BMW Brilliance |\n|   15.6 |   15.4 | BMW Brilliance                      |\n|   13.7 |   12.4 | Motorcycles                         |\n|   15.2 |   13.7 | Financial Services                  |\n\nFor the purposes of calculating cash flows beyond the planning period,  a  perpetual  annuity  return  is  assumed  which  does  not take growth into account. Forecasting assumptions are adjusted to current  information  and  regularly  compared  with  external sources. The assumptions used take account in particular of expectations of the profitability of the product portfolio, future market share development, macroeconomic developments (such as currency, interest rate and raw materials prices) as well as the legal environment and past experience.\n\nAssumptions also take into account the impact of climate -related aspects and the influence of other sustainability factors on business performance and the product portfolio, for example as a result of changes in demand patterns, regulatory requirements or changes in production conditions. In line with the BMW Group's strategy process and the ongoing transformation to electric mobility,  the  detailed  forecast  takes account  of  key  assumptions such as the planned increase in the share of electrified automobiles to over 50% and the required level of expenditure on research and development for vehicle models with battery-electric drives. Other matters to be considered are the scale of future investments in resource-saving production facilities (including any expected efficiency improvements), the cost of converting production processes from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources and, last but not least, the expected impact on the current leasing portfolio.\n\nAmounts are discounted on the basis of a market-related cost of capital rate. Impairment tests are performed for accounting and financial  reporting  purposes  and  using  a  risk-adjusted  pre-tax cost of capital (WACC) for the Automotive (excluding BMW Brilliance), BMW Brilliance and Motorcycles cash-generating units. In the case of the Financial Services cash-generating unit, a pretax cost of equity capital is used, as is customary in the sector. By analogous application of the procedures used for the other cash-generating units, the value in use is also determined for the BMW Brilliance cash-generating unit in view of the time period since the acquisition date.\n\nThe risk-adjusted discount rate, calculated using a capital asset pricing  model  (CAPM),  also  takes  into  account  specific  peergroup information relating to beta-factors, capital structure data and borrowing costs. No environmental, social and governance (ESG)-related adjustments were made to the WACC.\n\nIn  conjunction  with  the  impairment  tests  for  cash-generating units, sensitivity analyses are performed for the main assumptions in order to rule out that possible changes to the assumptions used to determine the recoverable amount would result in the requirement to recognise an impairment loss. Even in the case of a 10% deterioration in the individual measurement assumptions, an impairment loss would not arise. If the WACC were to develop as in the previous year, the value in use calculated for the Financial Services cash-generating unit would fall slightly below its carrying amount in 2024. The BMW Group does not, however, expect the WACC to develop as in the previous year.\n\nAll items of property, plant and equipment are measured at acquisition  or  manufacturing  cost  less  accumulated  depreciation and accumulated impairment losses.\n\nThe  cost  of  internally  constructed  plant  and  equipment  comprises all costs which are directly attributable to the manufacturing process as well as an appropriate proportion of productionrelated overheads. This includes production -related depreciation and amortisation as well as an appropriate proportion of administrative and social costs. Financing costs are not included in acquisition or manufacturing cost unless they are directly attributable to the asset. The carrying amount of items of depreciable\n\nproperty,  plant  and  equipment  is  written  down  according  to scheduled usage-based depreciation - as a general rule on a straight-line basis - over the useful lives of the assets. Depreciation is recorded as an expense in the income statement.\n\nThe  following  useful  lives are applied  throughout  the  BMW Group:\n\n| in years                                                   |         |\n|------------------------------------------------------------|---------|\n| Factory and office buildings, residential buildings, fixed |         |\n| installations in buildings and outside facilities          | 8 to 50 |\n| Plant and machinery                                        | 3 to 30 |\n| Other facilities, factory and office equipment             | 2 to 25 |\n\nThe useful life of the plant and equipment is reviewed regularly and extended or shortened as necessary. This review also takes account of the impact of climate-related aspects on useful lives, for example due to changes in demand patterns or regulatory requirements. This assessment is based on the assumptions used for long-term corporate planning purposes and product-related decisions, as described above. Climate-related aspects have an indirect  impact  on  the  utilisation  of  property,  plant  and  equipment. Adjustments to the useful lives of items of plant and machinery are avoided by a combination of flexible manufacturing arrangements  (independent  of  drivetrain  type  and  capable  of handling all vehicle generations) and asset-preservation measures. The useful lives of plant and machinery that are used exclusively  for  internal  combustion  vehicle  production  are  also covered by the most up-to-date planning assumptions. For machinery used in multiple-shift operations, depreciation rates are increased to account for the additional utilisation. If there is any indication of impairment of property, plant and equipment, an impairment test is performed as described above for intangible assets.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "A lease arises for IFRS 16 purposes either when an actual legal rental/lease agreement for property, plant and equipment is in place or when other contractual arrangements are in place that are equivalent to a lease in substance. Depending on the specific facts and circumstances of each individual case, power purchase agreements and long-term supply contracts for battery cells may also constitute a lease.\n\nThe BMW Group recognises a right-of-use asset and a liability for the outstanding lease payments with effect from the date on which the leased asset becomes available for use by the BMW Group.  The  cost  of  the  right-of-use  asset  is  the  sum  of  the amount at which the lease liability is initially measured, any lease payments made at or before the lease commencement date, any initial direct costs incurred by the lessee and the estimated costs of dismantling, removing or restoring the leased asset. Lease incentives granted by the lessor are deducted. Right -of-use assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the useful  life  of  the  leased  asset  and  the  expected  lease term.  If ownership of the leased asset is automatically transferred at the end of the lease term or the exercise of a purchase option is reflected in the lease payments, the right-of-use asset is depreciated on a straight-line basis over the expected useful life of the leased  asset.  Right-of-use  assets  are  reported  in  the  balance sheet within the relevant line items for property, plant and equipment.  The  depreciation  expense  on  right-of-use  assets  is  reported in the income statement in cost of sales as wel l as in selling and administrative expenses.\n\nThe lease liability is measured on initial recognition at the present value of the future lease payments. Subsequent to initial recognition, the carrying amount of the lease liability is increased to reflect interest on the lease liability and reduced, without income statement impact, by the lease payments made. Lease liabilities are reported within financial liabilities, while interest expense is reported as part of net interest result. In the cash flow statemen t, both the repayment portion and the interest portion of lease payments are shown as cash outflows from financing activities.\n\nNotes to the Group Financial Statements\n\nThe lease payments to be taken into account to measure the right-of-use  asset  and  the  lease  liability  comprise  fixed  payments, variable lease payments that depend on an index or an interest rate as well as amounts expected to be payable under residual value guarantees. If it is reasonably certain that a purchase or lease extension option will be exercised, the relevant payments are also included. Payments for periods for which the lessee has an option to terminate a lease unilaterally are only included in the lease payments if it is reasonably certain that the termination option will not be exercised. For the purposes of assessing options, the BMW Group takes account of all facts and circumstances that create an economic incentive to exercise or not to exercise the option.\n\nIFRS 16 requires that lease payments are discounted as a general  rule  using  the  interest  rate  implicit  in  the  lease.  However, since the interest rate in leases entered into by the BMW Group cannot readily be determined, amounts are discounted on the basis of the incremental borrowing rate.\n\nThe incremental borrowing rate comprises the risk-free interest rate in the relevant currency for matching maturities plus a premium for the credit risk. Specific risks attached to an asset are generally not taken into account, given that collateral received in the context of alternative financing arrangements is not relevant within the BMW Group.\n\nDetermining which items are to be counted as lease payments including the issue of the lease term underlying those payments - and which discount rate to apply involves using estimates and assumptions that may differ from actual outcomes.\n\nAs lessee, the BMW Group makes use of the application exemptions  available  for  short-term  leases  and  leases  of  low-value assets.\n\nGroup products recognised by BMW Group entities as leased products under operating leases are measured at manufacturing cost and all other leased products at acquisition cost, in each\n\ncase including initial direct costs. All leased products are depreciated over the period of the lease using the straight -line method down to their expected residual value.\n\nWhere the recoverable amount of a lease exceeds the asset's carrying amount, changes in residual value expectations are recognised by adjusting scheduled depreciation prospectively over the  remaining  term  of  the  lease.  If  the  recoverable  amount  is lower than the asset's carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognised for the shortfall. A test is carried out at each balance sheet date to determine whether an impairment loss recognised in prior years no longer exists or has decreased. In such cases, the carrying amount of the asset is increased to the recoverable amount, at a maximum up to the amount of the asset's amortised cost.\n\nAssumptions and estimations are required regarding future residual values, since these represent a significant part of future cash inflows. Relevant factors to be considered include the trend in market prices and demand on the pre -owned automobile market. The expected change in the drive- system mix going forward, which is subject to regular analysis, is also taken into account. The BMW Group has developed and implemented methods and processes  that  enable  sustainability  aspects  of  residual  value risks, particularly climate-related aspects, to be appropriately assessed and managed. A scenario-based approach is applied to quantify the impact of the transition towards zero- emissions mobility and factor in the technological progress of the products involved, resulting potentially in the need to adjust the estimated residual values of both internal combustion and electrified vehicles.  However, the transition to new drive systems will stretch over a period of time. Under these circumstances, regulatory aspects, customer behaviour and the structure of the product range all have to be taken into account. To varying degrees, the aforementioned aspects will play a role in bringing about changes to the existing product portfolio over the coming years. The nature of these planned changes can already be anticipated today to some extent, highlighting potential but calculable risks for future operations. Disproportionate risks can only arise in\n\nthe",

In addition to these various considerations,  the  vehicle  portfolio  subject  to  residual  value  risks  is  remeasured on a quarterly basis, allowing new aspects to be incorporated in the valuation at an early stage. In this case, valuations relevant for new business which are subject to the same turn of events would also be adjusted. The forecasting models used by the BMW Group are subject to regular review and can be supplemented where appropriate to include aspects relating to changes in the market.\n\nUsing this approach, upward or downward adjustments can be made to the forecast value on the basis of a range of scenario analyses. The assumptions are based on internally available historical data and current market data as well as on forecasts of external institutions. Furthermore, assumptions are regularly validated by comparison with external data. Certain types of contracts require a high degree of judgement when deciding whether they  give  rise  to  operating  leases  or  receivables  from  sales financing.\n\nInvestments  accounted  for  using  the  equity  method are measured - provided no impairment has been recognised - at cost  of  investment  adjusted  for  the  Group's  share  of  earnings and changes in equity capital. If there is any indication that an investment is impaired, an impairment test is performed on the basis of the discounted cash flow method. An  indicator exists, for example, in the event of a serious shortfall compared to budget, the  loss  of  an  active  market  or  if  funds  are  required  to  avoid insolvency.\n\nWith  the  exception  of  lease  receivables financial  assets are measured on initial recognition at their fair value. Financial assets  include,  in  particular,  other  investments,  receivables  from sales  financing, finance-related  receivables,  trade  receivables\n\nNotes to the Group Financial Statements\n\nand cash and cash equivalents. As a general rule, initial recognition takes place as soon as the BMW Group becomes a party to a contract. In the case of so-called 'regular way' purchases or sales of non-derivative financial assets, initial recognition takes place at the settlement date. Financial assets are derecognised when contractual cash flows attached to them have expired or are transferred and all significant risks and rewards have been passed on to the acquirer.\n\nReceivables from sales financing are measured as a general rule at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.\n\nAs part of its asset-backed securities (ABS) financing activities, the BMW Group transfers some of its receivables from sales financing - primarily retail customer and dealership financing receivables  -  to  structured  companies,  which  in  turn  securitise them  and  place  them  on  the  capital  market  as  collateralised securities.\n\nThe transferred receivables are not derecognised and therefore remain on the BMW Group's balance sheet. For this reason, receivables from sales financing fulfil the criteria of the 'hold' business model.\n\nReceivables from sales financing also include finance lease receivables which are measured at the amount of the net investment in the lease. This balance sheet line item also includes operating lease receivables at the end of the reporting period. The related vehicles are reported within the line item 'Leased products'.\n\nDepending on the business model and the structure of contractual  cash flows, financial assets are classified as measured at amortised cost, at fair value through comprehensive income or at fair value through profit or loss. The category 'measured at fair value through comprehensive income' at the BMW Group comprises mainly marketable securities and investment funds used for liquidity management purposes. In the BMW Group, selected marketable securities, shares in investment funds, money market  funds  and  convertible  bonds  are  measured  at  fair  value through profit or loss, as their contractual cash flows do not solely represent payments of principal and interest.\n\nThe BMW Group does not make use of the option to measure equity instruments at fair value through other comprehensive income or debt instruments at fair value through profit or loss.\n\nThe  market  values  of  financial  instruments  measured  at  fair value are determined on the basis of market information available at the balance sheet date, such as quoted prices or using appropriate measurement methods, in particular the discounted cash flow method.\n\nItems  reported  under other  investments within  the  scope  of IFRS 9 are measured at fair value through profit or loss. Investments in subsidiaries, joint arrangements and associated companies that are not material to the BMW Group are also included in other investments.\n\nWith  the  exception  of  receivables  from  operating  leases  and trade receivables, the BMW Group applies the general approach described in IFRS 9 to determine impairment of financial assets. Under the general approach, loss allowances are measured on initial recognition on the basis of the expected 12-month credit loss (stage 1). If the credit loss risk at the end of the reporting period has increased significantly since initial recognition, the impairment  allowance  is  measured  on  the  basis  of  lifetime  expected credit losses (stage 2  - general approach). The measurement of the change in default risk is based on a comparison of the default risk at the date of initial recognition and at the end of the reporting period. The default risk at the end of each reporting period is determined on the basis of credit checks, current key performance indicators and any overdue payments.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "The BMW Group applies the simplified approach described in IFRS 9 to operating lease and trade receivables, whereby the amount of the loss allowance is measured subsequent to the initial recognition of the receivable on the basis of lifetime expected credit losses (stage 2 - simplified approach). For the purpos es of allocating an item to stage 2, it is irrelevant whether the credit risk of the assets concerned has increased significantly since initial recognition.\n\nAs a general rule, the BMW Group assumes that a receivable is in default if it is more than 90 days overdue or if there are objective indications of insolvency, such as the opening of insolvency proceedings. Credit-impaired assets are identified as such on the basis of this definition of default. In the case of credit-impaired assets which had not been credit-impaired at the time they were acquired or originated, an impairment allowance is recognised at an amount equal to lifetime expected credit losses (stage 3). This is the case regardless of whether the general or simplified approach is applied. In the case of stage 3 assets, interest income is calculated on the asset's carrying amount less any impairment loss.\n\nIn addition, post-model adjustments are recorded if the risk is not fully covered by the standard models.\n\nThe BMW Group derecognises financial assets when it has no reasonable expectation of recovery. This may be the case, for instance, if the debtor is deemed not to have sufficient assets or other sources of income to service the debt.\n\nLoss allowances relating to the balance sheet line item 'Receivables from sales financing' are determined primarily on the basis of past experience with credit losses, current data on overdue receivables, rating classes and scoring information.\n\nNotes to the Group Financial Statements\n\nForward-looking information (for instance forecasts of key performance indicators) is also taken into account if, based on past experience, such indicators show a substantive correlation to actual credit losses.\n\nLoss allowances on trade receivables are determined primarily on the basis of information  relating to overdue amounts. Furthermore, both positive and negative economic scenarios are used alongside  the  latest  forecasts  of  key  performance  indicators when determining the level of valuation allowances. These scenarios are based on local analyses and take into account, for example, anticipated political and economic developments.\n\nInput factors available on the market, such as ratings and probabilities of default, are used to calculate valuation allowances for cash  and  cash  equivalents,  financial  assets,  receivables  from subsidiaries and receivables from companies in which an investment is held. In the case of marketable securities and investment funds, the BMW Group usually applies the option not to allocate financial assets with a low default risk  to different stages. Accordingly,  assets  with  an  investment grade rating are always allocated to stage 1.\n\nFinancial assets include in particular marketable securities and shares in investment funds as well as derivative financial instruments.\n\nDerivative  financial  instruments are used  within  the  BMW Group for hedging purposes in order to reduce currency, interest rate, fair value and market price risks. Derivative financial instruments are recognised as of the trade date, measured at their fair value. Depending on their market value at measurement date, these financial instruments are reported in the balance sheet line items 'Financial assets' or 'Financial liabilities'.\n\nFair values are determined on the basis of  valuation models. Observable  market  price,  tenor  and  currency  basis  spreads  are taken into account in the measurement of derivative financial instruments. Furthermore, the Group's own credit risk and that of counterparties is taken into account on the basis of credit default swap values for market contracts with matching terms.\n\nThe BMW Group applies the option to recognise the credit risks arising from the fair values of a group of derivative financial assets and liabilities on the basis of their total net amount. Portfolio-based  valuation  adjustments  (credit  valuation  adjustments and debit valuation adjustments) to the individual derivative financial assets and financial liabilities are allocated using the relative fair value approach (net method).\n\nWhere hedge accounting is applied, changes in fair value of derivative financial instruments are presented as part of other financial result in the income statement or within other comprehensive income as a component of accumulated other equity, depending on whether the hedging relationship is classified as a fair value hedge or a cash flow hedge.\n\nFair value hedges are mainly used to hedge interest rate risks relating  to  financial  liabilities.  The  currency  basis  is  not  designated as part of the hedging relationship in the case of cross currency interest rate hedges accounted for as fair value hedges. Accordingly, changes in the market value of such components are recorded as costs of hedging within accumulated other equity. Amounts accumulated in equity are reclassified to other financial result within the income statement over the term of the hedging relationship.\n\nIn addition, for selected fixed-interest assets, a portion of the interest rate risk is hedged on a portfolio basis in accordance with",

        "page_content": "IAS 39. The designated hedged items (underlying transactions) are reported in the balance sheet as receivables from sales financing or financial liabilities. Interest rate risks are hedged on the basis of the present value of net cash flows relating to fixed income assets (on the asset side) less cash flows relating to vari able-rate financing (on the liabilities side). The net cash flow determined in this way is hedged by purchasing corresponding interest rate swaps that have the effect of reducing the interest rate risk. Hedge relationships are terminated and redesignated on a monthly basis at the end of each reporting period, thereby taking account of the constantly changing content of each portfolio.\n\nFair value hedge ineffectiveness is generally recognised in other financial result.\n\nThe time values of option transactions and the interest component - including the currency basis - of forward currency contracts are not designated as part of the hedging relationship in the case of currency hedges accounted for as cash flow hedges. Changes in the fair value of such components are recorded as costs  of  hedging  on  a  separate  line  within  accumulated  other equity. Amounts recorded in accumulated other equity from currency hedges are reclassified to cost of sales when the related hedged item is recognised in profit or loss.\n\nIn the case of raw materials hedges that are accounted for as cash flow hedges, the hedging instruments are designated in full as part of the hedging relationship. Amounts recorded in accumulated other equity are included in the carrying amount of inventories  on  initial  recognition.  Ineffectiveness  arising  on  cash flow hedges is recognised directly in cost of sales, whereas the impact of prematurely terminated hedging relationships is recognised in other operating income and expenses.\n\nDeferred income taxes are recognised for all temporary differences between the tax and accounting bases of assets and liabilities, including differences arising on consolidation procedures,\n\nNotes to the Group Financial Statements\n\nas well as on unused tax losses and unused tax credits, when it is probable that they can be utilised. As an exception to this, deferred tax assets and liabilities resulting from the implementation of the Pillar Two rules are not recognised. Further information is provided in \u2197 note 5 .\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realised or the liability settled, based on tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.\n\nThe recoverability of deferred tax assets is assessed at each balance sheet date on the basis of planned taxable income in future financial years. If with a probability of more than 50% future tax benefits will not be realised, either in part or in total, a valuation allowance is recognised on the deferred tax assets. The calculation of deferred tax assets requires assumptions to be made with regard to the level of future taxable income and the timing of recovery of deferred tax assets. These assumptions take account of forecast operating results, announced legislative changes in connection with climate change and the impact on earnings of the reversal of taxable temporary differences. Since future business  developments  cannot  be  predicted  with  certainty  and to some extent cannot be influenced by the BMW Group, the measurement of deferred tax assets is subject to uncertainty.\n\nDeferred tax liabilities on taxable temporary differences arising from investments in subsidiaries, branches and associated companies as well as interests in joint arrangements are not recognised if the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. This is particularly the case if it is intended that profits will not be distributed, but rather will be used to maintain the substance and expand the volume of business of the entities concerned.\n\nCurrent income taxes are calculated within the BMW Group on the basis of tax legislation applicable in the relevant countries. To the extent that judgement was necessary to determine the treatment and amount of tax items presented in the financial statements, there is in principle a possibility that local tax authorities may take a different position.\n\nAs a general rule, each income tax treatment is considered independently when accounting for uncertainties in income taxes . If it is not considered probable that an income tax treatment will be accepted by the local tax authorities, the BMW Group uses the most likely amount of the tax treatment when determining taxable profit and the tax base.\n\nInventories of raw materials, supplies and goods for resale are generally stated at the lower of average acquisition cost and net realisable value.\n\nWork in progress and finished goods are stated at the lower of manufacturing cost and net realisable value. Manufacturing cost comprises all costs which are directly attributable to the manufacturing process as well as an appropriate proportion of production-related overheads. This includes production-related depreciation and amortisation and an appropriate proportion of administrative and social costs. Financing costs are not included in the acquisition or manufacturing cost of inventories.\n\nInventories also include vehicles held for sale in the financial services business, measured at their amortised cost or lower net realisable value.\n\nCash and cash equivalents comprise mainly cash on hand and cash at bank with an original term of up to three months. With the exception of money market funds, cash and cash equivalents are measured at amortised cost.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "Financial liabilities ,  with  the  exception  of  lease  liabilities,  are measured on first-time recognition at their fair value. For these purposes, transaction costs are taken into account except in the case of financial liabilities allocated to the category 'measured at fair value through profit or loss'. Subsequent to initial recognition, liabilities are - with the exception of derivative financial instruments - measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.\n\nProvisions for pensions are measured using the projected unit credit method. Under this method, not only obligations relating to known vested benefits at the reporting date are recognised, but also the effect of future expected increases in pensions and salaries. The calculation is based on independent actuarial valuations which take into account the relevant biometric factors.\n\nNotes to the Group Financial Statements\n\nNet interest expense on the net defined benefit liability or net interest income on the net defined benefit assets are presented separately within the financial result. All other costs relating to allocations to pension provisions are allocated to costs by function in the income statement.\n\nPast  service  cost  arises  where  a  BMW  Group  company  introduces a defined benefit plan or changes the benefits payable under an existing plan. This cost is recognised immediately in the income statement. Similarly, gains and losses arising on the settlement of a defined benefit plan are recognised immediately in the income statement.\n\nRemeasurement of the net liability can result from  changes in the present value of the defined benefit obligation, the fair value of the plan assets or the asset ceiling. Remeasurement can result, amongst others, from changes in financial and demographic parameters,  as  well  as  changes  following  the  portfolio  development.  Remeasurements  are  recognised  immediately  through other comprehensive income and ultimately in equity (within revenue reserves).\n\nOther provisions are recognised when the BMW Group has a present legal or factual obligation towards a third party arising from past events, the settlement of which is probable and when the amount of the obligation can be reliably estimated. Provisions with a remaining period of more than one year are measured at their net present value.\n\nIn  the  case  of  funded  plans,  the  pension  obligation  is  offset against plan assets measured at their fair value. If the plan assets exceed the pension obligation, the surplus is tested for recoverability. In the event that the BMW Group has a right of reimbursement or a right to reduce future contributions, it reports an asset (within Other financial assets), measured on the basis of the present value of the future economic benefits attached to the plan assets. For funded plans, in cases where the obligation exceeds plan assets, a liability is recognised under pension provisions.\n\nThe calculation of the amount of the provision requires assumptions to be made with regard to discount rates, pension trends, employee  fluctuation  and  the  life  expectancy  of  employees, among other things. Discount rates are determined by reference to market yields at the end of the reporting period on high -quality fixed-interest corporate bonds.\n\nThe measurement of provisions for statutory and nonstatutory  warranty  obligations  (statutory,  contractual  and voluntary) involves  estimations.  In  addition  to  manufacturer warranties prescribed by law, the BMW Group offers various further  standard  (assurance  type)  warranties  depending  on  the\n\nproduct and sales market. No provisions are recognised for additionally offered service packages that are treated as separate performance obligations.\n\nProvisions for statutory and non-statutory warranties are recognised at the point in time when control over the goods is transferred to the dealership or retail customer or when it is decided to introduce new warranty measures. With respect to the level of the provision, estimations are made in particular based on past experience of damage claims  and processes. Future potential repair costs and price increases per product and market are also taken into account. Provisions for warranties for all companies of the BMW Group are adjusted regularly to take account of new information, with the impact of any changes recognised in the income statement. Further information is provided in \u2197 note 34. Similar  estimates are also made in conjunction with the measurement of expected reimbursement claims.\n\nThe recognition  and  measurement  of  provisions  for litigation and liability risks necessitate making assumptions in order to determine the probability of liability, the amount of claim and the duration of the legal dispute. The assumptions made, especially the assumption about the outcome of legal proceedings, are subject to a high degree of uncertainty. The appropriateness of assumptions is regularly reviewed, based on assessments undertaken both by management and external experts, such as lawyers. If new developments arise in the future that result in a different assessment, provisions are adjusted accordingly.\n\nIf the recognition criteria relevant for provisions are not fulfilled and the outflow of resources on fulfilment is not unlikely, the potential obligation is disclosed as a contingent liability .\n\n<!-- image -->",

Details relating to these individuals and entities are provided in \u2197 note [41] and in the list of investments disclosed in \u2197 note [47] .\n\nShare-based remuneration programmes that provide for settlement in shares or a cash payment with a direct obligation to invest in shares of BMW AG common stock are measured at their fair  value  at  grant  date.  The  related expense is recognised as personnel expense in the income statement over the vesting period and offset against capital reserves.\n\nShare-based remuneration programmes expected to be settled in cash are revalued to their fair value at each balance sheet date between the grant date and the settlement date and on the settlement date itself.

Revenues  from the sales of products previously leased to customers, income from lease instalments and interest income on credit financing and finance leases are allocated to the Financial Services segment.\n\nOther income relates mainly to the Automotive segment and the Financial Services segment.\n\nThe major part of revenues expected to arise from the Group's order book at the end of the reporting period relates to the sale of vehicles. Revenues resulting from those sales will be recognised in the next financial year.\n\nThe services included in vehicle sale contracts that will be recognised as revenues in subsequent years represent only an insignificant portion of expected revenues. Accordingly, use has been made of the practical expedient contained in IFRS 15, permitting an entity not to disclose information on a quantitative basis due to the short-term nature of items and the lack of informational value of such disclosures.\n\nInterest income on credit financing and finance leases includes interest calculated on the basis of the effective interest method totalling  \u20ac 4,081 million  (2022:  \u20ac 3,656 million).

Further information on this matter is provided in the \u2197 BMW Group Report 2022, note [3] to the Group Financial Statements .\n\nThe negative sundry other financial result was attributable in particular to the unfavourable fair value development of interest rate hedges as a consequence of the decline in yield curves and portfolio effects. The previous year's figure included the positive impact of interest rate hikes in the financial year 2022.\n\nThe BMW Group falls within the scope of the OECD Pillar Two model rules aimed at ensuring a global minimum taxation rate of 15%. Under these rules, the BMW Group will be required pay a top-up tax to the extent that the Pillar Two specific tax rate in each jurisdiction where it operates falls below the minimum rate of 15%. The Pillar Two model rules have been implemented in Germany with effect for financial years beginning after 31 December 2023. The BMW Group is therefore not subject to a Pillar Two tax expense for the financial year 2023. The impact of the Pillar Two model rules from the financial year 2024 onwards is currently being assessed. For this purpose, the jurisdictions that could be affected by a top-up tax based on a preliminary Pillar\n\nTwo calculation have been analysed for the BMW Group, taking into account the statutory temporary simplification rules (for socalled 'transitional safe harbours'). Based on the results of the analysis to date, the tax expense arising in the relevant jurisdictions is estimated to be immaterial for the BMW Group. The BMW Group is already applying the exemption relating to the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities in connection with Pillar Two. Further information is provided in \u2197 note 5.\n\nDeferred taxes are determined on the basis of tax rates which are currently applicable or expected to apply in the relevant national jurisdictions when the amounts are recovered. After taking account of an average municipal trade tax multiplier rate (Hebesatz) of 430% (2022: 430%), the underlying income tax rate for Germany was as follows:\n\n|   in %  2023 |   2022 |                                                    |\n|--------------|--------|----------------------------------------------------|\n|         15   |   15   | Corporate tax rate                                 |\n|          5.5 |    5.5 | Solidarity surcharge                               |\n|         15.8 |   15.8 | Corporate tax rate including  solidarity surcharge |\n|         15.1 |   15.1 | Municipal trade tax rate                           |\n|         30.9 |   30.9 | German income tax rate                             |\n\nDeferred taxes for non-German entities are calculated on the basis of the relevant country-specific tax rates. These ranged in the financial year 2023 between 9.0% and 40.0% (2022: between 9.0% and 40.0%).\n\n<!-- image -->",

Taking account of numerous factors - including interpretations, commentaries and legal decisions relating to the various tax jurisdictions as well as past experience  -  adequate  provision  has  been  made,  to  the  extent identifiable and probable, for potential future tax obligations.\n\nNo deferred taxes are recognised on taxable temporary differences arising from investments in subsidiaries, associated companies and joint ventures if the BMW Group is able determine the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future, in particular in view of the fact that there is no intention to distribute the profits, but rather to use them to maintain substance and reinvest in the companies concerned. Temporary differences of this kind, for which no deferred taxes were recognised, amounted to \u20ac 36,081 million (2022: \u20ac 32,882 million). No computation  was  made  of  the  potential  impact  of  income taxes on the grounds of proportionality.\n\nTax loss carryforwards relating to Germany and foreign operations amounted to \u20ac 601 million (2022: \u20ac 711 million). This includes tax losses available for carryforward amounting to \u20ac 382 million (2022: \u20ac 416 million), on which a valuation allowance of \u20ac 129 million (2022: \u20ac 141 million) was recognised on the  related  deferred  tax  asset.  Of  these  loss  carryforwards, \u20ac 349 million  (2022:  \u20ac 382 million)  can  be  used  indefinitely, while \u20ac 33 million (2022: \u20ac 34 million) expires after one to three years.\n\nA net surplus of deferred tax assets over deferred tax liabilities amounting to \u20ac 95 million (2022: \u20ac 1,966 million) is reported for entities that have suffered tax losses in the financial year 2023 or the preceding year. The basis for the recognition of deferred taxes is the BMW Group business model or management's assessment that there  is material  evidence  that  the  entities  will generate future taxable profit, against which deductible temporary differences can be offset.\n\nCapital losses available for carryforward in the UK which do not relate to ongoing operations decreased due to changes in consolidated group companies and exchange rate factors and stood at \u20ac 1,845 million (2022: \u20ac 1,856 million) at the end of the year under report. As in previous years, deferred tax assets recognised on these tax losses amounting to \u20ac 461 million (2022: \u20ac 464 million) were fully written down since they can only be u tilised against future capital gains.\n\nDeferred  tax  assets  and  deferred  tax  liabilities  are netted for each relevant tax entity if they relate to the same tax authorities.",

Also included are  subsidies  for  tool  costs,  licences,  purchased  development projects,  emissions  allowances,  software  and  purchased  customer bases.\n\nOther intangible assets include brand-name rights amounting to \u20ac 96 million (2022: \u20ac 95 million) which are allocated to the Automotive segment and are not subject to scheduled amortisation since their useful life is deemed to be indefinite. The brand -name rights are, to an extent, subject to a limited right of ownership. Intangible assets also include goodwill of \u20ac 33 million (2022: \u20ac 33 million) allocated to the Automotive excluding BMW Brilliance cash-generating unit (CGU) and goodwill \u20ac 1,107 million  (2022: \u20ac 1,182 million)  allocated  to  the  BMW Brilliance CGU. Goodwill amounting to \u20ac 347 million (2022: \u20ac 347 million) related to the Financial Services CGU.\n\nAs in the previous year, there was no requirement to recognise impairment losses or reversals of impairment losses on intangible assets in 2023.\n\nAs in the previous year, no financing costs were recognised as a cost component of intangible assets in 2023.\n\nIn 2023, government grants totalling \u20ac 2 million (2022: \u20ac 0 million) were deducted from the acquisition cost of intangible assets for the first time. These grants include public sector funds aimed at promoting development.\n\nNotes to the Group Financial Statements\n\n## 22 Property, plant and equipment (including right-of-use assets arising from leasing)\n\nNo impairment losses were recognised in 2023, as in the previous year.\n\nAs in the previous year, no financing costs were recognised as a cost component of property, plant and equipment in 2023.\n\nRight-of-use assets arising from leases of land and buildings relate primarily to logistics and office premises and, to a lesser extent, to selling and production premises. In order to secure these premises  and,  in  the  interests  of  flexibility,  the  property  rental agreements concerned often contain extension and termination options.\n\n## 23 Leased products\n\nMinimum lease payments of non-cancellable operating leases fall due as follows:\n\n| in \u20ac million                   | 31.12.2023   | 31.12.2022                   |\n|--------------------------------|--------------|------------------------------|\n| 9,601                          | 9,606        | within one year              |\n| 6,872                          | 6,522        | between one and two years    |\n| 3,875                          | 3,465        | between two and three years  |\n| 1,813                          | 1,512        | between three and four years |\n| 305                            | 265          | between four and five years  |\n| 52                             | 38           | later than five years        |\n| Minimum lease payments  22,518 | 21,408       |                              |\n\nof In 2023, government grants t otalling  \u20ac 121 million  (2022: \u20ac 0 million) were deducted from the acquisition cost of property, plant  and  equipment  for  the  first  time.  These  amounts  relate mainly to public sector grants aimed at the promotion of regional structures as well as to subsidies received for plant expansions.\n\nImpairment losses amounting to \u20ac 553 million (2022: \u20ac 527 million) were recognised on leased products in 2023 as a consequence of changes in residual value expectations. Income from the reversal of impairment losses amounted to \u20ac 274 million (2022: \u20ac 282 million).\n\nThe regular review of the useful lives of items of property, plant and equipment subject to systematic depreciation takes into account  the  assumptions  contained  in  the  long-term  corporate plan, and hence the ongoing transformation towards electric mobility as well as the associated short- and medium-term impact on the product portfolio. The review of useful lives did not lead to any material adjustments in the financial year 2023.\n\nIn 2023, public sector grants totalling \u20ac 252 million (2022: \u20ac 0 million) were deducted from the acquisition cost of leased products for the first time. These amounts relate mainly to investment tax credits in the form of tax credits for electric vehicles. It is expected that the investment tax credits can be utilised. The actual utilisation of investment tax credits will, however, depend on the extent to which they can be offset against income  tax  liabilities  and  is  therefore  subject  to  a  degree  of uncertainty.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Subordinated tranches are retained by the BMW Group. Furthermore, t he BMW Group retains the exposure to interest rate risk in many transactions for which it concludes corresponding interest rate derivatives. The risk of delayed payments by debtors is reduced in the majority of ABS financing agreements by cash reserves financed by the BMW Group. Due to the risks remaining with the BMW Group, the ABS financing arrangements did not result in the derecognition of the securitised financial assets.\n\nThe carrying amount of receivables from sales financing transferred,  but  not  derecognised  at  31  December  2023  stood  at \u20ac 15,152 million  (2022:  \u20ac 14,487 million).  The  fair  value  of those receivables at that date was \u20ac 15,332 million (2022: \u20ac 14,428 million).\n\nThe carrying amount of the corresponding liabilities from assetbacked financing transactions at 31 December 2023 stood at \u20ac 12,089 million  (2022:  \u20ac 11,603 million).  The  fair  value  of these liabilities at that date was \u20ac 12,148 million (2022: \u20ac 11,635 million).\n\nNotes to the Group Financial Statements\n\nImpairment  allowances  on  receivables  from  sales  financing  in accordance with IFRS 9, which only arise within the Financial Services segment, developed as follows:\n\n|                                              | Stage 1   | Stage 2   | Stage 2    | Stage 3   |       |\n|----------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|------------|-----------|-------|\n| in \u20ac million                                 |           | General   | Simplified |           | Total |\n| Impairment allowances at 1 January 2023      | 576       | 935       | 35         | 599       | 2,145 |\n| Reclassification to Stage 1                  | 5         | - 47      | -          | - 1       | - 43  |\n| Reclassification to Stage 2                  | - 23      | 234       | -          | - 39      | 172   |\n| Reclassification to Stage 3                  | - 3       | - 52      | - 1        | 215       | 159   |\n| Derecognition and origination of receivables | 54        | 26        | 2          | - 20      | 62    |\n| Write-off of receivables                     | - 1       | - 24      | - 1        | - 98      | - 124 |\n| Changes in risk parameters                   | - 8       | - 5       | - 1        | - 2       | - 16  |\n| Other changes                                | - 19      | - 138     | 2          | - 11      | - 166 |\n| Impairment allowances at 31 December 2023    | 581       | 929       | 36         | 643       | 2,189 |\n\n|                                              | Stage 1   | Stage 2   | Stage 2    | Stage 3   |       |\n|----------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|------------|-----------|-------|\n| in \u20ac million                                 |           | General   | Simplified |           | Total |\n| Impairment allowances at 1 January 2022      | 447       | 550       | 35         | 567       | 1,599 |\n| Reclassification to Stage 1                  | 3         | - 22      | -          | - 2       | - 21  |\n| Reclassification to Stage 2                  | - 18      | 241       | -          | - 37      | 186   |\n| Reclassification to Stage 3                  | - 2       | - 36      | - 1        | 177       | 138   |\n| Derecognition and origination of receivables | 115       | 77        | 2          | - 24      | 170   |\n| Write-off of receivables                     | - 1       | - 15      | -          | - 87      | - 103 |\n| Changes in risk parameters                   | 85        | 44        | 2          | 3         | 134   |\n| Other changes                                | - 53      | 96        | - 3        | 2         | 42    |\n| Impairment allowances at 31 December 2022    | 576       | 935       | 35         | 599       | 2,145 |",

        "page_content": "An additional risk allowance for expected credit losses was recognised to take account of the negative impact on retail customer and dealership business, to the extent not covered by the standard  loss  provisioning  models  (post-model  adjustments).  The level of the additional risk allowance is reviewed regularly and has been reduced compared to the previous year, as the weaker macroeconomic  environment  has  already  been  partially  taken into account in the standard models. However, in view of the ongoing unfavourable macroeconomic prospects and geopolitical uncertainties, the additional risk allowance remains in the midthree-digit million range.\n\nImpairment allowances include \u20ac 95 million (2022: \u20ac 99 million) on credit-impaired receivables relating to finance leases.\n\nThe estimated fair value of vehicles held as collateral for creditimpaired receivables at the end of the reporting period totalled \u20ac 488 million (2022: \u20ac 455 million). The carrying amount of assets held as collateral and taken back as a result of payment default amounted to \u20ac 19 million (2022: \u20ac 35 million).\n\nNotes to the Group Financial Statements\n\nFinance leases are analysed as follows:\n\n| in \u20ac million                             | 31.12.2023       | 31.12.2022                                                |\n|------------------------------------------|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|\n| 7,107                                    | 7,112            | due within one year                                       |\n| 6,560                                    | 6,272            | due between one and two years                             |\n| 5,677                                    | 5,469            | due between two and three years                           |\n| 4,134                                    | 4,146            | due between three and four years                          |\n| 942                                      | 760              | due between four and five years                           |\n| 32                                       | 20               | due later than five years                                 |\n| 24,452                                   | 23,779           | Gross investment in finance leases                        |\n| 6,232                                    | 6,385            | due within one year                                       |\n| 5,857                                    | 5,694            | due between one and two years                             |\n| 5,191                                    | 5,061            | due between two and three years                           |\n| 3,935                                    | 3,914            | due between three and four years                          |\n| 836                                      | 688              | due between four and five years                           |\n| 29                                       | 19               | due later than five years                                 |\n|                                          | 22,080    21,761 | Net investment in finance leases without  loss allowances |\n| 2,372                                    | 2,018            | Unrealised interest income                                |\n| 458                                      | 435              | Loss allowances                                           |\n| Net investment in finance leases  21,622 | 21,326           |                                                           |\n\n## 26 Financial assets\n\nFinancial assets comprise:\n\n| in \u20ac million   | 31.12.2023   | 31.12.2022                                 |\n|----------------|--------------|--------------------------------------------|\n| 2,170          | 3,438        | Marketable securities and investment funds |\n| 2,926          | 4,386        | Derivative instruments                     |\n| 18             | 34           | Loans to third parties                     |\n| 404            | 379          | Other                                      |\n| 5,518          | 8,237        | Financial assets                           |\n| 1,387          | 3,073        | thereof non-current                        |\n| 4,131          | 5,164        | thereof current                            |\n\n## 27 Income tax assets\n\nIncome tax assets totalling \u20ac 1,199 million (2022: \u20ac 1,096 million) include claims amounting to \u20ac 29 million (2022: \u20ac 26 million), which are expected to be settled after more than one year.

In addition,  remeasurements of the net defined benefit obligation for pension plans are also presented in revenue reserves.\n\nThe Board of Management and the Supervisory Board propose that the unappropriated profit of BMW AG for the financial year 2023 amounting to \u20ac 3,802,488,470.32 be utilised to pay a dividend of \u20ac 6.02 for each share of preferred stock entitled to receive a dividend, and a dividend of \u20ac 6.00 for each share of common stock entitled to receive a dividend, and that the remaining amount be transferred to revenue reserves. Based on the number of shares at 31 December 2023 entitled to receive a dividend, the proposed dividend represents a total payout of \u20ac 3.8 billion.\n\nThe proposal for the appropriation of unappropriated profit takes into account 4,218,363 treasury shares of common stock and 942,892 treasury shares of preferred stock held directly or indirectly by the Company at 31 December 2023. In accordance with \u00a7 71b of the German Stock Corporation Act, these shares are not entitled to receive a dividend.\n\nThe number of shares entitled to receive a dividend may change prior to the Annual General Meeting. In this case, based on an unchanged distribution per share of common and preferred stock\n\nBMW AG's issued share capital totalling \u20ac 638,716,075 comprises 579,795,667 shares of common stock, each with a par value  of  \u20ac 1,  and  58,920,408  shares  of  non-voting  preferred stock, each with a par value of \u20ac 1. The issued share capital and the number of shares were reduced by \u20ac 24,123,400 in 2023 following  the  redemption  of  22,199,529  shares  of  common stock and 1,923,871 shares of preferred stock. These treasury shares had been acquired in conjunction with the first share buyback programme 2022/2023. The amount of the share capital reduction was reclassified to capital reserves.\n\nAll Company stock is issued to bearer. Preferred stock, to which no voting  rights  are  attached,  bears  an  additional  dividend  of \u20ac 0.02 per share.\n\nBMW AG is authorised to issue shares of non-voting preferred stock amounting to nominal \u20ac 5.0 million prior to 15 May 2024. At the end of the reporting period, 0.3 million shares of these amounting to \u20ac 0.3 million remained available for issue.\n\n## Capital reserves\n\nCapital reserves include mainly premiums arising from the issue of shares, and totalled \u20ac 2,456 million (2022: \u20ac 2,432 million).\n\nNotes to the Group Financial Statements\n\nentitled to receive a dividend, a correspondingly amended resolution concerning the appropriation of profit will be submitted to the Annual General Meeting.\n\nThe proposed distribution was not recognised as a liability in the Group Financial Statements.\n\n## Accumulated other equity\n\nAccumulated  other  equity  comprises  amounts  recognised  directly  in  equity  resulting  from  the  translation  of  the  financial statements of foreign subsidiaries, changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments and marketable securities, costs of hedging recognised directly in equity as well  as the related deferred taxes.\n\n## Treasury shares\n\nAt  the  Annual  General  Meeting  of  BMW  AG  held  on  11  May 2022, the shareholders authorised the Board of Management to acquire treasury shares via the stock exchange, up to a maximum of 10% of the share capital in place at the date of the resolution and to redeem those shares without any further resolution by the Annual General Meeting. The buyback authorisation remains valid until 10 May 2027.\n\nIn  conjunction  with  this  authorisation,  on  30  June  2022  the Board of Management of BMW AG resolved the first of a number of  share  buyback  programmes via the stock exchange. Under this initial programme, BMW AG was authorised to acquire treasury shares of common and preferred stock amounting to a maximum of \u20ac 1.85 billion and \u20ac 0.15 billion respectively. The share buyback programme was launched in July 2022 and completed on 30 June 2023.\n\nOn 3 May 2023, the Board of Management of BMW AG approved a second share buyback programme via the stock exchange. Under this programme, BMW AG is authorised to acquire treasury shares of common and preferred stock amounting to a maximum of \u20ac 1.65 billion and \u20ac 0.35 billion respectively. The programme commenced immediately following completion of the first buyback programme and will run until 31 December 2025 at the latest.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Within the Financial Services segment, however, there are a number of individual entities which are subject to equity capital requirements of relevant regulatory banking authorities.\n\nBased on the authorisation granted by the Annual General Meeting on 11 May 2022, the Board of Management of BMW AG resolved on 18 July 2023 (with effect as of 18 July 2023) to redeem the shares acquired by the Company as part of the first share  buyback  programme  (22,199,529  shares  of  common stock and 1,923,871 shares of preferred stock each wit h a nominal value of \u20ac 1) and to reduce the Company's share capital from \u20ac 663 million to \u20ac 639 million. This corresponds to around 3.6% of share capital prior to the redemption of the shares and the reduction of issued share capital.\n\nUp to 31 December 2023, a total of 4,218,363 shares of common stock had been bought back via the stock exchange at an average price per share of \u20ac 98.38 and a total acquisition cost of \u20ac 415 million,  corresponding  to  0.64%  of  share  capital. The shares concerned are held by BMW AG as treasury shares at the end of the reporting period.\n\nIn  order  to  manage its capital structure, the BMW Group uses various instruments, including the amount of dividends paid to shareholders and share buybacks. Moreover, the BMW Group actively manages debt capital, carrying out funding activities with a target debt structure in mind.\n\nA key aspect in the selection of financial instruments is the objective to achieve matching maturities for the Group's financing requirements. In order to reduce non-systematic risk, the BMW Group uses a variety of financial instruments available on the world's capital markets to achieve diversification.\n\nUp to 31 December 2023, a total of 942,892 shares of preferred stock had been bought back via the stock exchange at an average price per share of \u20ac 90.15 and a total acquisition cost of \u20ac 85 million, corresponding  to  0.14%  of  share  capital. The shares concerned are held by BMW AG as treasury shares at the end of the reporting period.\n\nOn 19 September 2023, the Board of Management resolved a share buyback programme for shares of common stock for employees ('Share Buyback Programme Employee Shares 2023') which was carried out during the period from 8 November to 27 November 2023. The acquisition of shares of common stock u nder this programme serves the sole purpose of fulfilling the obligations arising from the Employee Share Programme. Based on the  applications  received  from  eligible  employees,  1,290,000 shares of common stock were bought back and subsequently sold to employees at a preferential price of \u20ac 71.47 per share. These shares are entitled to receive dividends for the first time with effect from the financial year 2023.\n\nThe capital structure at the end of the reporting period was as follows:\n\n| in \u20ac million   |         | 31.12.2023  31.12.2022                        |\n|----------------|---------|-----------------------------------------------|\n| 89,596         | 87,125  | Equity attributable to shareholders of BMW AG |\n| 48.5%          | 48.1%   | Proportion of total capital                   |\n| 52,880         | 53,469  | Non-current financial liabilities             |\n| 42,130         | 40,727  | Current financial liabilities                 |\n| 95,010         | 94,196  | Total financial liabilities                   |\n| 51.5%          | 51.9%   | Proportion of total capital                   |\n| 184,606        | 181,321 | Total capital                                 |\n\nEquity attributable to shareholders of BMW AG increased during the  financial  year  by  2.8%,  primarily  reflecting  the  increase  in revenue reserves.\n\n## 32 Non-controlling interests\n\nThe 25% non-controlling interests of other shareholders in the subsidiary  BMW  Brilliance  represent  a  significant  item  in  the BMW Group's balance sheet.\n\nTotal comprehensive income allocated to the other shareholders of BMW Brilliance amounts to \u20ac 615 million (2022: \u20ac 580 million). A dividend of \u20ac 1,447 million (2022: \u20ac 1,445 million) was distributed to these shareholders during the financial year 2023. At 31 December 2023, non-controlling interests in BMW Brilliance amounted to \u20ac 2,970 million (2022: \u20ac 3,709 million).\n\nFinancial information relating to BMW Brilliance is summarised in  the  following  table  from  a  100%  perspective  (2022: from 11 February 2022):\n\n| in \u20ac million                                  | 2023             | 2022    |\n|-----------------------------------------------|------------------|---------|\n| DISCLOSURES RELATING TO THE  INCOME STATEMENT |                  |         |\n| Revenues                                      | 33,227    29,243 |         |\n| Profit after tax                              | 3,262            | 2,140   |\n| Total comprehensive income                    | 2,327            | 2,193   |\n| DISCLOSURES RELATING TO THE                   |                  |         |\n| BALANCE SHEET                                 |                  |         |\n| Non-current assets                            | 16,352           | 18,823  |\n| Current assets                                | 11,044           | 12,344  |\n| Non-current liabilities                       | 3,601            | 4,059   |\n| Current liabilities                           | 9,773            | 9,756   |\n| DISCLOSURES RELATING TO THE                   |                  |         |\n| CASH FLOW STATEMENT                           |                  |         |\n| Total cash flows                              | - 621            | - 4,268 |\n\n<!-- image -->",

Defined benefit plans may be covered by provisions or pension assets. In Germany, pension obligations of the BMW Group are almost entirely covered by assets transferred to BMW Trust e.V., Munich (BMW Trust), in conjunction with a Contractual Trust Arrangement (CTA) (funded plan). In addition, funded plans also exist in the UK as well as in the USA, Switzerland, Belgium and Japan.  In  the  meantime,  all  of  the  main  defined  benefit  plans have been closed for new entrants and replaced by defined contribution plans.\n\nNotes to the Group Financial Statements\n\nIn addition, a career trend component, which is plan-dependent and lies within a range of 0.25% to 0.50%, is taken into account in the measurement of pension obligations in Germany (2022: career trend of 0.25% to 0.50%).\n\nThe assumptions stated below, which depend on the economic situation in the relevant country, are used to measure the defi ned benefit obligation of each pension plan.

In addition to retirement benefits, pension benefits also  include  disability  and  surviving  dependents'  benefits.  The level of ongoing pension payments is adjusted in accordance with \u00a7 16 of the Company Pensions Act (Betriebsrentengesetz).\n\nTwo employer-funded pension plans are in place that are based on defined contributions for which the level of benefits depends on developments on the capital markets. Benefits granted by the two plans are funded by a combination of the payment of fixed monthly contributions by the Company, a deferred remuneration option for employees and a matching contribution by the Company. Further contributions are made on the basis of the BMW Group's performance. A further plan is in place that is funded entirely out of deferred remuneration. Due to the minimum interest rate guaranteed by the BMW Group, these plans are all classified as defined benefit plans in accordance with IAS 19. In addition to the above plans, an employer-funded, defined benefit pension\n\nplan with lifelong pension benefits remains in place which is now closed to new entrants. The pension benefit is calculated by multiplying a fixed amount by the number of completed years of service. Only employees who have not agreed to a one-time option to switch to the defined contribution system will receive future increases in entitlements under this plan.\n\n## UK\n\nDefined benefit plans exist in the UK which are closed for all plan participants. Vested benefits remain in place. New benefits are covered by contributions made to a defined contribution plan.\n\nThe  defined  benefit  pension  plans  are  administered  by  BMW Pension Trustees Limited, Farnborough, and BMW (UK) Trustees Limited, Farnborough, both trustee companies which act independently of the BMW Group. BMW (UK) Trustees Limited, Farnborough, is represented by ten trustees and BMW Pension Trustees Limited, Farnborough, by five trustees. A minimum of one third  of  the  trustees  must  be  elected  by  plan  participants.  The trustees represent the interests of plan participants and decide on investment strategies. Funding contributions to the funds are determined in agreement with the BMW Group.\n\nThe assets of the German pension plans are invested by BMW Trust (a German association) in accordance with a CTA. The representative bodies of the association are the Board of Directors and  the  Members'  General  Meeting.  BMW  Trust  currently  has seven members and three members of the Board of Directors elected by the Members ' General Meeting. The Board of Directors is  responsible for investments, drawing up and deciding on investment guidelines as well as monitoring compliance with those guidelines. The members of the association can be employees, employee representatives, senior executives and members of the Board of Management of BMW AG. An ordinary Members' General Meeting takes place once every calendar year, and deals with a range of matters, including receiving and approving the association's annual report, ratifying the activities of the Board of Directors and adopting changes to the association's statutes.",

Plan  assets  of  the  BMW  Group  include  own transferable financial instruments amounting  to \u20ac 17 million (2022: \u20ac 7 million).\n\nThe BMW Group is exposed to risks arising both from defined benefit plans and defined contribution plans with a minimum return guarantee. The discount rates used to calculate pension obligations are subject to market fluctuations and therefore influence the level of the obligations. Furthermore, changes in other actuarial  parameters,  such  as expected  rates  of  inflation,  also have an impact on pension obligations. In order to reduce currency exposures, a substantial portion of plan assets is either invested in the same currency as the underlying plan or hedged by means of currency derivatives. As part of the internal reporting procedures  and  for  internal  management  purposes,  financial risks relating to the pension plans are reported using a value-atrisk approach by reference to the pension deficit. The investment strategy is also subject to regular review together with external consultants, with the aim of ensuring that investments are structured to match the timing of pension payme nts and the expected development of pension obligations. In this way, fluctuations in pension provisions recognised in the balance sheet are reduced.",

Liabilities may be settled earlier than this depending on the timing of the underlying proceedings.\n\nThe  provisions  for  other  obligations  cover  numerous  specific risks and uncertain obligations, in particular for litigation and liability risks as well as risks relating to the order backlog.\n\nDepending on when claims occur, it is possible that the BMW Group may be called upon to fulfil the warranty or guarantee obligations  over  the  whole  period  of  the  warranty  or  guarantee. Warranty provisions include amounts recognised in connection with the exhaust gas recirculation cooler. Expected reimbursement claims at 31 December 2023 amounted to \u20ac 819 million (2022: \u20ac 872 million) and are disclosed within other assets (see \u2197 note [28]).\n\nProvisions  for  obligations  for  personnel  and  social  expenses comprise mainly obligations relating to performance-related remuneration  components,  workforce  measures  as  well  as  preretirement  part-time  working  arrangements  and  long-service awards.",

This assessment may change over time and is adjusted regularly on the basis of new information and circumstances. A part of the risks is covered by insurance.\n\nThe EU Commission's antitrust proceedings were settled on 8 July  2021 (see \u2197 note [10] to  the  BMW  Group  Financial  Statements for the financial year 2021 included in the BMW Group Report 2021).\n\nIn addition, respective antitrust proceedings were against BMW AG by the Chinese State Administration for Market Regulation in March 2019 and the Korea Fair Trade Commission in May 2020. Possible risks for the BMW Group in connection with the antitrust proceedings in China cannot be currently foreseen, neither in terms of their outcome nor the amounts involved.\n\nNotes to the Group Financial Statements\n\nestimated at present. Further disclosures pursuant to IAS 37.86 cannot be provided at present.\n\nIn March 2022, the European Commission (EC) conducted inspections at the premises of automobile manufacturers and associations located in several member states. In parallel, the EC sent out formal requests for information to several automobile manufacturers,  including  BMW  AG.  The  inspections  and  requests for information concern possible collusion in relation to the collection, treatment and recovery of end-of-life vehicles and light commercial vehicles. The inspections were conducted in coordination with the UK Competition and Markets Authority, which has initiated formal proceedings in respect of the UK market. The competition authorities allege that car manufacturers (i) coordinated the remuneration to be paid to dismantlers for the provision of their services and (ii) agreed that issues related to endof-life  vehicles  should  be  dealt  with  in  a  non-competitive  way. Appropriate risk provisions were recognised in the second quarter 2022 in connection with these investigations. At the current stage of the investigations, further risks for the BMW Group in connection with the proceedings of the two authorities cannot be quantified at present. In December 2023, the South Korean anti trust authority conducted an inspection at the premises of several car manufacturers, including BMW Korea. The investigation by  the  South  Korean  antitrust  authority  has  the  same  background as the investigations of the European Commission and the UK Competition and Markets Authority. Due to the early stage of this investigation, it is also not possible to provide further information  in  this  regard.  Further  disclosures  pursuant  to  IAS 37.86 cannot be provided at present.\n\nIn  April  2023, the South Korean antitrust authority imposed a fine  of  approximately  13  billion  South  Korean  won  (approximately \u20ac 9 million). BMW AG will no longer take action against the authority's decision.\n\nIn relation to these allegations, numerous class action lawsuits have been brought in the USA and Canada in the second half of 2017, as well as several individual customers' lawsuits in South Korea in June 2018. In the USA, the customer class actions were withdrawn in August 2021 and the dealer class action was dismissed in the final instance in June 2022. In Canada, the class action lawsuits have been discontinued without any payments made by BMW. The individual customers' lawsuits in South Korea remain at an early stage. Further civil lawsuits based on the allegations are possible going forward. Further disclosures pursuant to IAS 37.86 cannot be provided at present.\n\nBeginning in 2014, regulatory authorities have ordered the BMW Group to recall various vehicle models in conjunction with airbags supplied  by  the  Takata  group  of  companies.  Provision  for  the costs involved has been recognised within warranty provisions. In addition to the risks already covered by warranty provisions, it cannot be ruled out that further vehicles of the BMW Group will be affected by future recall actions. Further disclosures pursuant to IAS 37.86 cannot be provided at present.\n\nopened In May 2023, the National Highway  Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), an agency of the US federal government, requested a recall of airbags in the USA that are equipped with airbag inflators  produced  by  ARC  Automotive.  Further  implications  for  the BMW Group in other regions outside of North America as well as implications from class action lawsuits, which have been brought in this context against the BMW Group in the USA, cannot be",

        "page_content": "Following a request for legal assistance from the Korean authorities in 2020 in connection with leaks in exhaust gas recircu lation modules in BMW Group vehicles, the Munich public prosecutor's office initiated an investigation and searched BMW Group offices in Munich and Steyr in June 2022. Potential risks for the BMW Group cannot be quantified at the present time. Further disclosures pursuant to IAS 37.86 cannot be provided at present.\n\nIn several recent judgements, the European Court of Justice has ruled on emission control systems in diesel vehicles and has significantly tightened requirements pertaining to the justification of these systems. As a result of these new judgements by the European Court of Justice, the interpretation of regulatory requirements for emission control systems is evolving. This is reflected, amongst other things, by the fact that established administrative practices of type approval authorities are being questioned from numerous sides. This development leads to a reassessment of civil proceedings pending in Germany due to the emissions performance of BMW and MINI diesel vehicles. According to previously established case law of German national courts, damage claims could only be asserted on the basis of intentional damage inflicted in a manner offending common decency. In its most recent judgements linked to proceedings against other manufacturers and taking into account the case law of the European Court of Justice, the German Federal Court of Justice has ruled that a manufacturer can also be held liable for negligent breach of EU homologation standards and on the basis of a far-reaching reversal of the burden of proof to the detriment of the manufacturer. An increase in the effort and complexity of the defence in individual cases, an increasing number of new court proceedings, increased legal risks and increased financial expenditure are to be expected. Further disclosures pursuant to IAS 37.86 cannot be provided at present.\n\nNotes to the Group Financial Statements\n\nIn addition, the KBA determined in February 2024 that two functionalities  of  the  emission  control  system  of  the  BMW  vehicle model X3 with 2.0 litre diesel engine (EU5), built between September 2010 and March 2014 do not comply with legal requirements. The KBA views these functionalities as prohibited defeat devices. The BMW Group has filed a timely objection against this decision.  Corrective  measures  are  currently  being  coordinated with the responsible type approval authorities. Furthermore, the BMW Group is investigating whether and to what  extent functionalities of the emission control systems of this and other past diesel vehicle models comply with legal requirements and is in dialogue with the responsible authorities in this regard. Also, against the  background  of  the  development  in  case law  referred  to above,  it  is  possible  that  further  authorities  and/or  courts  find fault with functionalities of the emission control systems or deem them as non-compliant with legal requirements. Given that the investigations will take some time, it is not currently possible to make any disclosures pursuant to IAS 37.86 with regard to possible  measures to be taken, possible effects on administrative and civil court proceedings and any financial risks that may be related thereto.\n\nFurthermore,  several  BMW  Group  entities  have  been  facing  a number of diesel emissions-related court claims in England and Wales since November 2021 as well as in Scotland since March 2023. In November 2023, the High Court approved a group litigation regarding the proceeding in England and Wales. In December 2023, the court ordered that at least three out of the 16 pending  court  proceedings  against  OEMs  will  proceed  to  trial from October 2024 onwards. The proceedings against two other OEMs have already been selected, and the selection  of  other OEM proceedings is expected to follow in March 2024. In Scotland, the court also approved the combination of relevant claims in group proceedings. It is estimated that any sued BMW Group entities will have to file their statement of defence in April 2024. Given that proceedings are still at an early stage, the probability, amount or timing of any liability cannot be determined at present. Further disclosures pursuant to IAS 37.86 cannot be provided at present.\n\n## Other financial commitments\n\nIn addition to liabilities, provisions and contingent liabilities, the following commitments exist for the BMW Group at the end of the reporting period:\n\n| in \u20ac million                                            | 31.12.2023   | 31.12.2022   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Purchase commitments for property, plant  and equipment | 7,712        | 5,758        |\n| Purchase commitments for intangible assets              | 1,912        | 2,252        |\n\n<!-- image -->",

For the purposes of fair value measurement using the discounted cash flow method, expected future cash flows are discounted on the basis of up-to-date interest rate curves observable on the market.\n\nNotes to the Group Financial Statements\n\nThe fair values of receivables from sales financing are measured using the discounted cash flow method, taking into account customer-specific  credit  risk.  In  view  of  the  fact  that  these  allowances are calculated in part on the basis of internal information, receivables from sales financing are allocated to Level 3 in the level hierarchy in accordance with IFRS 13.\n\nIn the case of financial liabilities, own credit risk is taken into account based on credit default swaps available on the market, so that the fair values of these items are allocated to Level 2.\n\nFor all other financial instruments not listed here that are measured at amortised cost, the carrying amount corresponds to the fair value. For this reason, they are not presented separately.\n\n|                                                                 | 31.12.2023   | 31.12.2023       | 31.12.2022   | 31.12.2022       |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|------------------|--------------|------------------|\n| in \u20ac million                                                    | Fair value   | Carrying  amount | Fair value   | Carrying  amount |\n| Receivables from sales financing - credit financing             | 67,307       | 65,092           | 65,237       | 63,808           |\n| Receivables from sales financing - finance and operating leases | 23,539       | 22,263           | 22,600       | 21,900           |\n| Financial liabilities                                           |              |                  |              |                  |\n| Bonds                                                           | 40,919       | 39,808           | 42,173       | 41,084           |\n| Asset-backed financing transactions                             | 19,951       | 20,085           | 18,542       | 18,746           |\n| Liabilities from customer deposits (banking)                    | 17,591       | 18,016           | 15,939       | 16,511           |\n| Liabilities to banks                                            | 5,906        | 5,824            | 7,302        | 7,255            |\n\n<!-- image -->",

Key liquidity-specific performance indicators are cash on hand, cash burn rates and prospects for future financing rounds.\n\napproach  taken  to  unquoted  equity  instruments,  as  described above.\n\nSince the pricing from the financing rounds is considered to be the  decisive  input  factor  for  the  valuation,  increases  and  decreases in valuation give rise to a similar change in the equity instrument that is recognised in the income statement.\n\nIn addition, equity instruments that are held outside the private equity fund are measured using the income approach. This involves discounting cash flows on the basis of current business cases using the weighted average cost of capital to determine the fair value of the financial instrument. Changes in fair values determined in connection with adjustments to significant input factors are not material for the BMW Group.\n\nThe convertible bonds that have been classified to Level 3 are primarily  used  as  instruments  in  advance  of  future  financing rounds  relating  to  private  equity  investments.  Valuations  are therefore performed in accordance with the IPEV guidelines.\n\nMandatory conversions are usually structured in such a way that the number of shares to be received depends on the future share price. Due to the generally short maturities, the instruments are subject to only insignificant fluctuations in value. Irrespective of this fact, impairment tests are performed at regular intervals.\n\nFinancial instruments allocated to Level 3 relate mainly to investments in a private-equity fund. The valuation of unlisted equity instruments is determined primarily using the market-based approach. In particular, the financing rounds that take place within the private equity sector - usually on a regular basis at intervals of approximately 12 to 24 months - represent a significant input factor  for  these  purposes.  In  addition,  the  investment  advisor provides the external fund manager with relevant, investmentspecific information on an ongoing basis (at least quarterly). The latter subsequently  assesses  the  underlying  individual  companies in accordance with the guidelines for International Private Equity and Venture Capital Valuations (IPEV).\n\nAs part of the process of analysing valuations, the external fund manager reviews the investment-specific milestones, including an  analysis  of  financial,  technical  and  liquidity-specific  performance indicators,  among  others.  Based  on  this  analysis,  it  is considered whether the price of the most recent financing round is accept-able as a reasonable market valuation, in particular for early-stage or growth-phase investments. Key performance indicators used for the purpose of milestone analysis are dependent on the business model underlying the investment. Typical technical key performance indicators relate to licenses and patents  held,  the  stage  of  technology  development  such  as  evidence of feasibility and prototypes, market entries, customer and user growth and appointments to key management positions. Key financial performance indicators used are revenues, EBITDA and the corresponding growth rate and/or development  of\n\nThe fair value of the options that the BMW Group holds in shares of such investee companies is measured primarily on the basis of a binomial model, taking into account the respective conditions under which the options were granted. The comments provided on the income-based approach used to measure equity instruments held outside the private equity fund apply analogously for the  purposes  of  determining  the  relevant  entity  value  that  is taken into account when measuring the fair value of the options. The exercise price for share options arising in conjunction with the private equity fund is generally low,  verging towards zero. Consequently, financing rounds have a direct impact on the fair value of the options. In this respect, the valuation of options and assessment of their impact on sensitivity is similar to\n\nthe\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "Notes to the Group Financial Statements\n\n## Credit risk\n\nThe BMW Group is exposed to counterparty credit risks if contractual partners, for example a retail customer or a dealership, are unable or only partially able to meet their contractual obligations. Information on the management of credit risk for receivables from sales financing is provided in the Combined Management Report. ( \u2197 Outlook and \u2197 Risks and Opportunities )\n\nNet gains and losses arising on financial instruments measured at fair value  through  other  comprehensive  income  relate  to changes in the fair value of marketable securities. Further details are provided in \u2197 note [19] . Total interest income arising on financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income amounted to \u20ac 82 million (2022: \u20ac 37 million) and total interest expense to \u20ac 18 million (2022: \u20ac 10 million).\n\nNet gains and losses arising on financial instruments measured at fair value through profit and loss mainly include results from the fair value measurement of stand-alone derivatives, marketable securities and shares in investment funds, as well as other financial assets.\n\nNet gains  and  losses  arising  on  financial  assets  measured  at amortised cost include mainly exchange rate gains/losses and impairment losses/reversals.\n\nNet gains and losses arising on financial liabilities measured at amortised cost comprise mainly exchange rate gains/losses.\n\nFinancial  instruments  measured  at  amortised  cost  are  sometimes subject to carrying amount adjustments that are recognised through profit or loss as part of the application of hedge accounting. These carrying amount changes are largely neutralised by the offsetting changes in fair value arising on hedging transactions and for this reason are not reported in the figure s for net gains and losses.\n\nTotal  interest  income  arising  on  financial  assets  measured  at amortised cost relates mainly to the interest income earned on credit financing and reported within revenues. Total interest expenses arising on financial instruments measured at amortised cost amounted to \u20ac 2.5 billion (2022: \u20ac 1.7 billion).\n\nNotwithstanding the existence of collateral accepted, the carrying amount of financial assets (with the exception of derivative financial instruments) generally represents the maximum credit risk.  In  addition,  the  credit risk  is  increased  by  additional  unutilised loan commitments in the dealership financing line of business. Total dealership financing credit risk at the end of the reporting  period  therefore  amounted  to \u20ac 32,149 million  (2022: \u20ac 31,163 million).\n\nSecurity is also put up by  customers in the form of collateral asset pledges, asset assignment and first-ranking mortgages, supplemented where appropriate by warranties and guarantees. Items previously held as collateral that are subsequently acquired relate mainly to vehicles. As a rule, these assets can be converted into  cash  at  short  notice  through  the  dealership  organisation. Creditworthiness  testing  is  an  important  aspect  of  the  BMW Group's credit risk management. Every borrower's creditworthiness is tested for all credit financing and lease contracts entered into by the BMW Group. In the case of retail customer financing, creditworthiness is assessed using validated scoring systems integrated in the purchasing process.\n\nIn the area of dealership financing, creditworthiness is assessed by means of ongoing credit monitoring and an internal rating system that takes account not only of the material credit standing of the borrower, but also of qualitative factors, such as past reliability in business relations.\n\nThe credit risk on trade receivables is assessed mainly on the basis of information relating to overdue amounts. The gross carrying amounts of these receivables are allocated in accordance with IFRS 9 to overdue ranges used for management purposes as follows:\n\nIn the case of all relationships underlying non -derivative financial instruments, in order to minimise the credit risk and depending on  the  nature  and  amount  of  exposure,  collateral  is  required, credit  information  and  references  obtained  or  historical  data based on the existing  business  relationship,  in  particular  payment behaviour, reviewed.\n\nIn  the  case  of  trade  receivables,  customers  are  regularly  assessed with regard to their credit risk. Depending on contractual status,  necessary measures, such as dunning procedures, are initiated in good time.\n\nThe credit risk relating to cash deposits and derivative financial instruments is minimised by the fact that the Group only enters into such contracts with parties of first-class credit standing.\n\nWithin the financial services business, items financed for retail customers and dealerships (such as vehicles, facilities and property)  serve  as  first-ranking  collateral  with  a  recoverable  value.\n\n| in \u20ac million   | 31.12.2023   | 31.12.2022                |\n|----------------|--------------|---------------------------|\n| 3,718          | 3,871        | Not overdue               |\n| 339            | 208          | 1-30 days overdue         |\n| 42             | 31           | 31-60 days overdue        |\n| 29             | 11           | 61-90 days overdue        |\n| 104            | 65           | More than 90 days overdue |\n| Total  4,232   |              | 4,186                     |\n\n<!-- image -->",

In  order  to  hedge  currency  risks,  the  BMW  Group holds, as at 31 December 2023, derivative financial instruments mostly in the form of forward currency contracts and currency swaps.\n\n| in \u20ac million   | 31.12.2023   | 31.12.2022        |\n|----------------|--------------|-------------------|\n| 39,157         | 43,179       | Currency exposure |\n\nCurrency exposures include short positions amounting \u20ac 2,136 million (2022: \u20ac 3,604 million).\n\n## Interest rate risk\n\nInterest rate risks arise when funds are borrowed and invested with differing fixed-rate periods or differing terms. At the BMW Group, all items subject to, or bearing, interest are exposed to interest rate risk and can therefore affect both the assets and liabilities side of the balance sheet.\n\nThe fair value of the Group's interest rate portfolios was as follows at the end of the reporting period:\n\n| in \u20ac million                                | 31.12.2023   | 31.12.2022   |\n|---------------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|\n| to  Fair values of interest rate portfolios | 73,510       | 73,954       |\n\nThe currency  exposure  is  compared  to  all  hedges  that  are  in place. The net cash flow surplus represents an uncovered risk position. The cash-flow-at-risk approach involves showing the impact of potential exchange rate fluctuations on operating cash flows on the basis of probability distributions. Volatilities and correlations serve as the main input factors to determine the relevant probability distributions.\n\nThe potential negative impact on earnings is calculated at  the reporting date for each currency for the following financial year on the basis of current market prices and exposures with a confidence level of 95%. The risk mitigating effect of correlations between the various currencies is taken into account when t he risks are aggregated.\n\nThe following table shows the potential negative impact for the BMW Group for the following year resulting from unfavourable changes in exchange rates, measured on the basis of the cashflow-at-risk approach.\n\nAs part of the implementation of the risk management strategy, the extent to which risk exposures should be hedged is decided at regular  intervals.  The  economic  relationship  between  the hedged item and the hedging instrument is based essentially on the  fact  that  they  are  denominated  in  the  same  currency  and have the same maturities. Items are hedged on the basis of a constant ratio of one to one between hedging instrument and risk exposure.\n\n| in \u20ac million      |   31.12.2023 |   31.12.2022 |\n|-------------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Cash flow at risk |          493 |          530 |\n\nCauses  of  hedge  ineffectiveness  are  seen  potentially  only  for counterparty credit risk.

The  analysis  of  currency  risk  is  based  on  forecast\n\nInterest rate risk is managed through the use of interest rate derivatives. As part of the implementation of the risk management strategy, interest rate risks are monitored and managed at regular  intervals.  The  interest  rate contracts  used  for  hedging  purposes comprise mainly swaps, which, if hedge accounting is applied, are accounted for as fair value hedges. The economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument is based on the fact that the main parameters of the hedged item and the related hedging instrument (e.g. start date, term and currency) are the same. Items are hedged on the basis of a constant ratio of one to one between hedging instrument and risk exposure.\n\nIn view of the fact that own credit risk is excluded from the hedging relationship, ineffectiveness is expected to be low.\n\nFor selected fixed-interest assets, part of the interest rate risk is hedged on a portfolio basis. In this case, swaps are used as the hedging instrument. Hedge relationships are terminated and redesignated on a monthly basis at the end of each reporting period, thereby taking account of the constantly changing content of each portfolio.\n\nIn light of the reform and replacement of certain benchmark interest  rates,  some  of  the  BMW  Group's  hedging  relationships have been redesignated to take account of alternative benchmark interest rates.",

In order to hedge these risks, the Group mainly uses forward commodity contracts. As part of the implementation of the risk management strategy, the extent to which risk exposures should be hedged is decided at regular intervals and the corresponding hedging ratio defined. Items are hedged on the basis of a constant ratio of one to one between hedging instrument and risk exposure.\n\nThe transition to the newly created or revised benchmark interest rates is being managed, monitored and assessed with regard to risk management implications as part of a multidisciplinary project. The tasks of the conversion project includes the continual monitoring of regulatory developments, the initiation of necessary  changes  to  systems,  processes,  risk  and  measurement models as well as the clarification of the associated accounting and financial reporting implications. In the financial year 2023, all contracts based on USD LIBOR were converted to alternative benchmark interest rates (\u20ac 412 million).\n\ncorrelations serve as input factors to assess the relevant probability distributions.\n\nThe potential negative impact on earnings is calculated at the reporting date for each raw materials category for the following financial year on the basis of current market prices and exposure with a confidence level of 95%. The risk mitigating effect of correlations  between  the  various  categories  of  raw  materials  is taken into account when the risks are aggregated.\n\nCauses  of  hedge  ineffectiveness  are  seen  potentially  only  for counterparty credit risk. However, in view of the processes that have been established for credit risk management, ineffectiveness is not expected to arise.\n\nThe following table shows the potential negative impact for the BMW Group resulting from fluctuations in prices across all categories of raw materials, measured on the basis of the cash -flowat-risk approach. The risk at each reporting date for the  following financial year was as follows:\n\n| in \u20ac million   | 31.12.2023     | 31.12.2022        |\n|----------------|----------------|-------------------|\n|                | 1,045    1,115 | Cash flow at risk |\n\nThe economic relationship  between  the  hedged  item  and  the hedging  instrument  is  based  essentially  on  the  fact  that  they have the same basis and term. The BMW Group designates only the commodity price index -linked raw materials surcharge, which is specified in the purchase contracts of vehicle components, as a hedged item. The proportion of the hedged risk component as a percentage of the total fair value depends on the specific types of  vehicle  component  involved.  Other  price  components  contained in the contract are not designated as being part of the hedge relationship as no effective hedging instruments exist for these components.\n\nThe starting point for analysing raw materials price risk is to identify planned purchases of raw materials or components containing  raw  materials,  the  so-called  'exposure'.  At  each  reporting date, the exposure for the following financial year amounted to:\n\n| in \u20ac million                 | 31.12.2023   | 31.12.2022   |\n|------------------------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Raw material price exposures | 9,033        | 10,153       |\n\nIn the case of CAD CDOR and PLN WIBOR, uncertainty remains as to the exact timing and nature of the changes. Non- derivative financial instruments that have not been converted to an alternative  interest  rate  at  31  December  2023  all  relate  to  the  CAD CDOR, with a nominal liability amount of \u20ac 171 million (2022: \u20ac 242 million). Derivative financial instruments that have not been converted to an alternative interest rate at 31 December 2023 all relate to the PLN WIBOR, with a nominal amount of \u20ac 584 million (2022: \u20ac 100 million).\n\nThe BMW Group applies a value -at-risk approach throughout the Group for  internal  reporting  purposes  and  to  manage  interest rate risk.\n\nThis approach is based on a historical simulation in which the potential future fair value losses of the interest rate portfolios are compared across the Group with expected amounts on the basis of a  holding  period  of  250  days  and  a  confidence  level  of 99.98%. The risk mitigating effect of correlations between the various portfolios is taken into account when the risks are aggregated.\n\nIn the following table the potential volumes of fair value fluctuations - measured on the basis of the value-at-risk approach are compared with the expected value for the interest-rate-sensitive exposures of the BMW Group:\n\n| in \u20ac million   | 31.12.2023   | 31.12.2022   |\n|----------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Value at risk  | 1,967        | 2,097        |\n\nThis exposure is compared to all hedges that are in place.

        "page_content": "## 42 Share-based remuneration\n\nThe BMW Group has three share-based programmes: one for eligible employees, one for eligible senior department heads and one for members of the Board of Management.\n\n## Employee Share Programme\n\nNotes to the Group Financial Statements\n\nAs at 31 December 2023, the BMW Group recorded personnel expenses resulting from the Employee Share Programme relating  to  the  difference  between  the  market  price  and  the  discounted price for the shares of common and preferred stock, respectively, purchased by employees totalling \u20ac 28 million (2022: \u20ac 23 million).\n\n## Senior department head and Board of Management programme\n\nBoth the share-based remuneration programme for members of the Board of Management that was in force in the reporting year and the share-based remuneration programme for eligible senior department heads serve to reward long-term entrepreneurial conduct with sustainable business management in mind.\n\nBoard of Management members and eligible senior department heads receive an earmarked cash amount (personal cash investment amount) that is, net of tax and deductions, to be invested in shares of BMW AG common stock. This amount depends on the achievement of certain financial and non-financial targets in the past financial year (vesting year).\n\nyear Payment of the personal cash investment amount is made after the Annual General Meeting at which the Financial Statements are presented for the relevant financial year. The shares of common stock are purchased immediately after the personal cash investment amount has been paid out and are subject to a holding period of four years from the date of purchase. The RoCE component and the strategic focus target component each make up half of the  target  amount  for  the  personal  cash  investment amount. For the RoCE component, a RoCE factor is determined based on the RoCE achieved in the Automotive segment for the grant year. For the strategic focus target component, a minimum of two strategic focus targets are defined prior to the start of the financial year. Minimum, target and maximum values are  defined and factors are assigned for the RoCE in the Automotive segment and for each strategic focus target. The relevant factors are determined after the end of the financial year based on the extent to which targets were achieved.\n\nthe\n\nFor  financial  years  up to  and  including  financial  year  2020, Board of Management members received an earmarked cash amount (investment component) corresponding to 45% of the\n\nWithin the scope of the Employee Share Programme in  the financial  year  2023,  eligible  BMW  Group  employees  were  granted shares of BMW AG common stock on preferential terms (for information  on  the  number  and  price  of  the  shares  of  common stock issued see \u2197 note [31] ). At their discretion, participants in the programme were able to purchase packages of 10, 20, 30, 40 or  50  shares  of  common  stock  (2022:  10,  20,  35,  50  or  65 shares  of  preferred  stock)  with  a  discount  of  \u20ac  20.00  (2022: \u20ac 16.00) on each share as compared to the market price (average closing price in Xetra trading in the period 1 to 6 November 2023:  \u20ac  91.47).  Employees  who  are  currently  employed  by BMW AG or a wholly owned subsidiary of BMW AG based in Germany were able to partake in the programme, insofar as the subsidiary's  management  had  decided  to  participate.  Employees were required to have been in their positions for at least one year without interruption at the time the programme was announced and had to remain in their positions until the shares of common stock were transferred.\n\nThe shares of common stock acquired in the scope of the Employee Share Programme are subject to a vesting period of four years calculated from 1 January of the year in which the shares of common stock were acquired. These shares of common stock are entitled to receive dividends for the first time with effect from the financial year 2023.\n\nA total of 1,290,000 shares of common stock were transferred to employees in the reporting year (2022: 1,439,975 shares of preferred stock). The 1,290,000 shares of common stock were acquired in the scope of the Employee Share Programme. The 1,439,975 shares of preferred stock in the previous stemmed from Authorised Capital 2019. BMW AG's Board of Management decides each year whether to continue programme.\n\ngross amount of the bonus that, net of tax and deductions, had to be invested in shares of the Company's common stock (up to and including  financial  year  2017,  the  investment  component amounted to 20% of the total bonus after tax, which the Board of Management members received plus tax and social security as additional cash remuneration). This amount was also subject to a four-year holding period and on expiry thereof the Board of Management  members  received  one  additional  share  of  the Company's  common  stock  or  the  equivalent  value  in  cash (matching component) for every three shares of common stock held, at BMW AG's discretion.\n\nIn the event of death or invalidity, special rules apply for early payment of share-based remuneration components (matching components) based on the target amounts, and the holding period is also dropped for shares of common stock that were acquired with share-based remuneration components. Where the service contract is terminated prematurely and the Company has an extraordinary right of termination, or if the Board member resigns without the Company's agreement, entitlements amounts  as  yet  unpaid  relating  to  share-based  remuneration (matching  components)  are  forfeited;  a  personal  cash  investment amount will be settled based on the target amount.\n\nUp to and including financial year 2021, eligible senior department heads committed to invest 26% of their earnings-related bonus in shares of BMW AG common stock and to hold the acquired shares for four years. For the investment obligation, BMW AG granted an amount corresponding to the entire investment amount as a net subsidy.\n\nParticipants receive one additional share of common stock or the equivalent value in cash for every three shares of common stock held once the four-year holding requirement has been fulfilled, at the Company's discretion.\n\nThe Board of Management members in office on the balance sheet date hold 112,969 shares of BMW common stock with a holding obligation arising from share-based remuneration for financial years 2019 to 2022 (2022: 118,604).\n\nto",

The expense for such programmes is recognised in the income statement (as personnel expense) on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of the options and in the balance sheet as a provision.\n\nNotes to the Group Financial Statements\n\n## 44 Remuneration for members of the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board\n\nThe expenses recorded in accordance with IFRS in financial year 2023 for remuneration for the active members of the Board of Management  and  Supervisory Board are broken down follows:\n\nThe  remuneration  system  does  not  provide  for  any  further matching components for the members of the Board of Management  from  financial  year  2021  or  for  the  senior  department heads from financial year 2022.\n\nThe cash settlement of the share-based remuneration component is measured at fair value on the balance sheet date (closing price of BMW AG common stock in Xetra trading on 31 December 2023).\n\nThe total carrying amount of the provision for the share-based remuneration component for eligible active and former Board of Management  members  and  senior department heads \u20ac 5,982,815 on 31 December 2023 (2022: \u20ac 6,971,951).\n\nThe total expense arising from the share-based remuneration component for eligible active and former Board of Management members and senior department heads was \u20ac 1,598,368 in financial year 2023 (2022: \u20ac 638,715).\n\n## 43 Declaration with respect to the Corporate Governance Code\n\n| in \u20ac million                                              | 2023         | 2022                     |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------|--------------|--------------------------|\n| Remuneration for the members of the  Board of Management  |              |                          |\n|                                                           | 32.9    33.8 | Short-term benefits      |\n| Other long-term benefits                                  | 3.2    3.1   |                          |\n| Benefits resulting from termination of the Board  mandate | -            | 5.4    0.2               |\n|                                                           | 0.1          | Share-based remuneration |\n| Remuneration for the members of the Supervisory Board     |              |                          |\n|                                                           | 5.8    5.5   | Short-term benefits      |\n| Total expense                                             | 47.5         | 42.5                     |\n\nwas The costs for the active members of the Board of Management arising from share-based remuneration, which was in force until 2020 inclusive, amounted to \u20ac 0.2 million (2022: \u20ac 0.1 million).

The  segmentation  follows  the  internal management and reporting system and takes account of the organisational structure of the BMW Group based on the various products and services of the reportable segments.\n\nThe activities of the BMW Group are broken down into the operating segments Automotive, Motorcycles, Financial Services and Other Entities.\n\nNotes to the Group Financial Statements\n\nAutomobile and motorcycle leasing, retail and dealership financing, multi-brand fleet business, customer deposit business and insurance activities are the main activities allocated to the Financial Services segment.\n\nHolding and Group financing companies are reported in the Other Entities segment. This segment also includes the operating company Bavaria Lloyd Reiseb\u00fcro GmbH, which is not allocated to one of the other segments.\n\n## Internal management and reporting\n\nWithin the Automotive segment, the BMW Group develops, manufactures,  assembles  and  sells  automobiles  powered  with  allelectric drive systems, plug-in hybrid systems and highly efficient combustion engines, as well as spare parts, accessories and mobility  services  under  the  BMW,  MINI  and  Rolls-Royce  brands. BMW and  MINI  brand  products  are  sold  in  Germany  through branches of BMW AG and by independent, authorised dealerships. Sales outside Germany are handled mainly by subsidiary companies and by independent import companies in some markets. Rolls-Royce brand vehicles are sold in selected markets via subsidiary companies and elsewhere by independent, authorised dealerships.\n\nActivities  relating  to  the  development,  manufacture,  assembly and sale of motorcycles as well as spare parts and accessories are reported in the Motorcycles segment.\n\nSegment information is prepared as a general rule in conformity with the accounting policies adopted for preparing and presenting the Group Financial Statements. Exceptions to this general principle include the treatment of inter -segment warranties, the earnings impact of which is allocated to the respective segments on the basis used internally to manage the business. In addition, intragroup repurchase agreements between the Automotive and Financial Services segments pursuant to IFRS 15, imp airment allowances on intragroup receivables and changes in the value of consolidated other investments pursuant to IFRS 9 are also excluded. Intragroup leasing arrangements are not reflected in the internal management and reporting system on an IFRS 16 basis and therefore, in accordance with IFRS 8, do not give rise to any changes in the presentation of segment information. Inter-segment  receivables  and  payables,  provisions,  income,  expenses and profits are eliminated upon consolidation. Inter -segment revenues are based on market prices. Centralised cost components are included in the respective segments, without resulting in cash flows.\n\nThe role of 'chief operating decision maker' with respect to resource allocation and performance assessment of the reportable segment is embodied in the full Board of Management. For this purpose, different measures of segment performance as well as segment assets are taken into account in the segments.\n\noperatin\n\nThe Automotive and Motorcycles segments are managed on the basis of return on capital employed (RoCE). The relevant measure of segment results used is therefore profit before financial result. Capital employed is the corresponding measure of segment assets used to determine how to allocate resources. Capital employed is calculated as the sum of intangible assets, property, plant and equipment and net working capital, the latter comprising inventories as well as trade receivables less trade payables.\n\nFurther information is provided in the section 'Managing operational performance at segment level' within the Combined Management Report.\n\nThe success of the Financial Services segment is measured on the basis of return on equity (RoE). Profit before tax therefore represents the relevant measure of segment ea rnings. The measure of segment assets in the Financial Services segment corresponds to net assets, defined as total assets less total liabilities.\n\nThe success of the Other Entities segment is assessed on the basis of profit or loss before tax. The corresponding measure of segment assets used to manage the Other Entities segment is total  assets  less  asset-side  income  tax  items  and  intragroup investments.",

In the reconciliation of segment assets to Group assets, eliminations relate mainly to intragroup financing balances.\n\n<!-- image -->",

In addition, we have audited the group management report of Bayerische Motoren Werke Aktiengesellschaft, which is combined with the Company's management report, for the financial year from 1 January to 31 December 2023. In accordance with the German legal  requirements,  we  have  not  audited  the  content  of those parts of the group management report listed in the \"Other Information\" section of our auditor's report.\n\nIn our opinion, on the basis of the knowledge obtained in the audit,\n\n- -the accompanying consolidated financial sta tements comply, in all material respects, with the IFRSs as adopted by  the  EU,  and  the  additional  requirements  of  German commercial law pursuant to \u00a7 [Article] 315e [paragraph] 1 HGB [Handelsgesetzbuch: Commercial Code] and, in compliance with these requirements,  give  a  true  and  fair  view  of  the  assets, liabilities, and  financial  position  of  the  Group  as  at  31 December 2023, and of its financial performance for the financial year from 1 January to 31 December 2023, and\n- -the accompanying group management report as a whole provides an appropriate view of the Group's position. In all material respects, this group management report\n\nconsistent with the consolidated financial statements, complies with German legal requirements appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development. Our audit opinion on the group management report  does  not  cover  the  content  of  those  parts  of  the group management report listed in the \"Other Information\" section of our auditor's report.\n\nPursuant to \u00a7 322 Abs. 3 Satz [sentence] 1 HGB, we declare that our audit has not led to any reservations relating to the legal compliance of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report.\n\n## Basis for the Audit Opinions\n\nAbs. German We conducted our audit of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report in accordance with \u00a7 317 HGB and the EU Audit Regulation (No. 537/2014, referred to subsequently as \"EU Audit Regulation\") in compliance with German Generally Accepted Standards for Financial Statement Audits promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftspr\u00fcfer [Institute of Public Auditors in Germany] (IDW). Our responsibilities under those requirements and principles are further described in the \"Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements and of the Group Management Report\" section of our auditor's report. We are independent of the group entities in accordance with the requirements of European law and German commercial and professional law, and we have fulfilled our  other  German  professional  responsibilities  in  accordance with these requirements. In addition, in accordance with Article 10 (2) point (f) of the EU Audit Regulation, we declare that we have  not  provided  non-audit  services  prohibited  under  Article 5 (1) of the EU Audit Regulation.

        "page_content": "provide a basis for our audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the group management report.\n\n## Key Audit Matters in the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements for the financial year from 1 January to 31 December 2023. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our audit opinion thereon; we do not provide a separate audit opinion on these matters.\n\nIn our view, the matters of most significance in our audit were as follows:\n\n## 1/ Measurement of leased products\n\n## 2/ Valuation of receivables from sales financing\n\n## 3/ Valuation of provisions for statutory and non-statutory warranty obligations as well as product guarantees\n\nOur presentation of these key audit matters has been structured in each case as follows:\n\n- 1/ Matter and issue\n- 2/ Audit approach and findings\n- 3/ Reference to further information\n\nHereinafter we present the key audit matters:\n\n## 1/ Measurement of leased products\n\n1/ The BMW Group leases vehicles to end customers under operating leases (leased products). At the balance sheet date, the figure reported under the \"leased products\" line item for operating leases was EUR 43,118 million (approximately 17.2% of total assets). Leased products are measured at cost, which is depreciated on a straight-line basis over the lease term to the expected residual value (recoverable amount). A key estimated value for subsequent measurement of leased products is the\n\nexpected residual value at the end of the lease term. For the residual value forecasts the BMW Group uses internally available data  on  historical  empirical  values,  current  market  data  and market estimates as well as forecasts by external market research institutes. The residual value estimates also contain regulatory changes in the individual markets and expectations regarding customer behavior, among others including climate policy  considerations. The estimation of future residual values is subject to judgment due to the large number of assumptions to be made by the executive directors and the amount of data included in the determination.\n\nAgainst this background and due to the resulting significant uncertainties with regard to estimates in the context of measuring the residual values of the leased products, this matter was of particular significance in the context of our audit.\n\n2/ As part of our audit we obtained an understanding of the development  of  operating  leases,  the  underlying  residual  value risks  as well  as  the  business  processes  for  the  identification, management, monitoring and measurement of residual value risks, among other things by inquiries and inspection of documents related to the internal calculation methods. Furthermore, we evaluated the appropriateness and effectiveness of the internal control system, particularly regarding the determination of expected  residual  values.  This  included  the  evaluation  of  the propriety of the relevant IT systems as well as the implemented interfaces therein by our IT-specialists. In addition, we evaluated the appropriateness of the forecasting methods, the model assumptions as well as the parameters used for the measurement of the residual values based on the validations carried out by the BMW  Group.  For  this  purpose,  we  inquired  with  the  BMW Group's experts responsible for the management and monitoring of residual value risks and inspected the internal analysis on residual  value  developments  and  residual  value  forecasts  as well as the validation results. We examined the mathematical correctness  of  the  forecast  values  using  the  key  calculation steps.\n\nBased on our audit procedures, we were able to satisfy ourselves that the methods and processes for determining the expected residual values of leased products underlying the\n\nvaluation are appropriate and the assumptions and parameters included in the forecast model for the residual value are appropriate as a whole.\n\n3/ The Company's disclosures on the applied \"Accounting policies, assumptions, judgments and estimations\" are contained in the notes to the consolidated financial statements under note 6 and on leased products are contained under note 23.\n\n## 2/ Valuation of receivables from sales financing\n\n1/ The BMW Group offers end customers, dealerships and importers  various  financing  models  for  vehicles.  In  this  context, current and non-current receivables from sales financing totaling EUR 87,355 million are reported in the consolidated statement of financial position as at the balance sheet date (approximately 34.8% of total assets). Impairment losses amounting to EUR 2,189 million were recognized on these receivables as at the balance sheet date. In order to determine the amount of the necessary valuation allowances to be recognized with respect to  receivables  from  sales  financing,  the  BMW  Group,  among others, evaluates the creditworthiness of the dealers, importers and end customers, as well as any loss ratios, and risk provisioning parameters are derived based on historical default probabilities and loss ratios.\n\nThe determination of the valuation allowances by the executive directors is subject to a significant degree of judgment due to several value-influencing factors such as the estimation of creditworthiness, the determination of probabilities of default and loss  ratios  and  was  therefore  of  particular  significance  in  the context of our audit.\n\n2/  As  part  of  our  audit  we  obtained  a  comprehensive  understanding of the development of receivables from sales financing, the associated default-related risks as well as the business processes for the identification, management,  monitoring  and measurement of default risks, among other things by inquiries and inspection of documents on the internal calculation methods. Furthermore, we evaluated the appropriateness and effectiveness of the internal control system regarding the determination of the impairment loss to be recognized. In this context, we\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "also evaluated the relevant IT systems and internal processes. The evaluation included an assessment by our IT-specialists of the appropriateness of the systems concerned and associated interfaces to ensure the completeness of data as well as the audit of automated controls for data processing. As part of our audit  we  assessed  in  particular  the  appropriateness  of  the  risk classification procedures as well as the risk provisioning parameters used. For this purpose, we analyzed in particular the validations of parameters that are regularly conducted by the Company. To assess the default risk, we also used targeted sampling of individual cases to examine whether the attributes for assignment to the respective risk categories were suitably available and the impairment losses had been calculated using the parameters defined for these risk categories.\n\nIn our view, the assumptions and  parameters used in the measurement of receivables from sales financing were appropriate overall.\n\n3/ The Company's disclosures on the applied \"Accounting policies, assumptions, judgments and estimations\" are contained in the notes to the consolidated financial statements under note 6 and on \"receivables from sales financing\" are contained under note 25.\n\n## 3/ Valuation of provisions for statutory and non-statutory warranty obligations as well as product guarantees\n\n1/ Provisions for statutory and non-statutory warranty obligations as well as product guarantees are included in the consolidated financial statements of BMW Group as a material amount in  other  provisions.  The  obligations  amounted  to  EUR  9,650 million (approximately 3.8% of total assets) as at 31 December 2023. The BMW Group is responsible for the legally required warranty and product guarantees in the respective sales market. In order to estimate the liabilities arising from statutory and non statutory warranty obligations as well as product guarantees  for vehicles sold, information on the type and volume of damages arising and on remedial measures is recorded and analyzed at\n\nvehicle model level. The expected amount of obligations is extrapolated from costs of the past and recognized as a provision in the corresponding amount, if the criteria of IAS 37 have been met. For specific or anticipated individual circumstances, for example recalls for vehicles sold, additional provisions are recognized provided they have not already been taken into account.\n\nThe determination of provisions is associated with unavoidable estimation uncertainties and is subject to a high risk of change, depending on factors such as notification of detected defects as well as claims made by vehicle owners. Against this background, this matter was of particular significance during our audit.\n\nparameters and assumptions used by the executive directors are appropriate.\n\n3/ The Company's disclosures on the applied \"Accounting policies, assumptions, judgments and estimations\" are contained in the notes to the consolidated financial statements under note 6 and on \"Other provisions\" are contained under note 34.\n\n## Other Information\n\nThe  executive  directors  are  responsible  for  the  other  information. The other information comprises the following non-audited parts of the group management report:\n\nRISK\n\n- -the section \"APPROPRIATENESS AND EFFECTIVENESS OF THE INTERNAL CONTROL SYSTEM AND MANAGEMENT  SYSTEM\"  of  the group management report\n- -the  disclosures  marked  with [[ ]] of  the  non-financial statement to comply with \u00a7\u00a7 289b to 289e HGB and with \u00a7\u00a7 315b to 315c HGB\n\nThe other information comprises further\n\n- -the statement on corporate governance pursuant to \u00a7 289f HGB and \u00a7 315d HGB\n- -the remuneration report pursuant to \u00a7 162 AktG [Aktiengesetz: German  Stock  Corporation  Act],  for  which the supervisory board is also responsible\n- -all remaining parts of the annual report - excluding crossreferences to external information - with the exception of the audited consolidated financial statements, the audited group management report and our auditor's report\n\n2/  In order  to  assess  the  appropriateness  of  the  valuation method used for the determination of the provisions for statutory and non-statutory warranty obligations as well as product guarantees including the assumptions and parameters, we primarily obtained an understanding of the process for determining the assumptions and parameters through discussions with the responsible employees of the BMW Group. We also evaluated the appropriateness as well as effectiveness of controls for determining the assumptions and parameters. With the involvement of our IT specialists, we checked the IT systems used regarding their compliance. We compared the expenses for claims and technical actions with actual costs incurred in order to draw conclusions on the forecast accuracy. Based on a targeted sample of vehicle models, the mathematical correctness of the valuation model used across the Group was examined. We examined and evaluated the assumptions used by the BMW Group concerning the extent to which the past values were representative of the expected susceptibility of damage, the expected value of damage per vehicle (comprising parts and labor input) as well as the expected assertion of claims from statutory and n on-statutory warranties.\n\nIn our view, the method for the valuation of provisions for statutory and non-statutory warranty obligations as well as product guarantees is overall appropriate. Taking into consideration the information available, we believe that , overall, the measurement\n\nOur audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the group management report do not cover the other information, and consequently we do not express an audit opinion or any other form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\n<!-- image -->",

In addition the executive directors are responsible for such internal control as they have determined necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud (i.e., fraudulent financial reporting and misapprop riation of assets) or error.\n\nIn preparing the consolidated financial statements, the executive directors are responsible for assessing the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. They also have the responsibility for disclosing, as applicable, mat ters related to going concern. In addition, they are responsible for financial reporting based on the going concern basis of accounting unless there is an intention to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or there is no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\nFurthermore,  the  executive  directors  are  responsible  for  the preparation of the group management report that, as a whole, provides an appropriate view of the Group's position and is, in all material respects, consistent with the consolidated financial statements,  complies  with  German  legal  requirements,  and\n\nappropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development. In addition, the executive directors are responsible for such arrangements and measures (systems) as they have considered necessary to enable the preparation of a group management report that is in accordance with the applicable German legal requirements, and to be able to provide sufficient appropriate evidence for the assertions in the group management report.\n\nThe supervisory board is responsible for overseeing the Group's financial  reporting  process  for  the  preparation  of  the  consolidated financial statements and of the group management report.\n\nWe exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n\nomissio\n\n- -Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the  consolidated  financial  statements  and  of  the  group management report, whether due to fraud or error, design and  perform  audit  procedures  responsive  to  those  risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to  provide  a  basis  for  our  audit  opinions.  The  risk  of  not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher  than  for  one  resulting  from  error,  as  fraud  may involve collusion, forgery, intentional misrepresentations, or the override of internal controls.\n\nof\n\n- about -Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit of the consolidated financial statements and arrangements  and  measures  (systems)  relevant  to  the audit of the group management report in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an audit opinion on the effectiveness of these systems.\n- -Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used by the executive directors and th e reasonableness of estimates  made  by  the  executive  directors  and  related disclosures.\n\nour\n\n- -Conclude on the appropriateness of the executive directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material un certainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant  doubt  on  the  Group's  ability  to  continue  as  a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists,  we  are  required  to  draw  attention  in  the  auditor's report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements and in the group management report or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify respective audit opinions. Our conclusions are based on the audit  evidence  obtained  up  to  the  date  of  our  auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to be able to continue as a going concern.\n\nAuditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements and of the Group Management Report Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and whether the group management report as a whole provides an appropriate view of the Group's position and, in all material respects,  is  consistent  with  the  consolidated  financial  statements and the knowledge obtained in the audit, complies with the German legal requirements and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development, as well as to issue an auditor's report that includes our audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the group management report.\n\nReasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with \u00a7 317 HGB and the EU Audit Regulation and in compliance with German Generally Accepted Standards for Financial Sta tement Audits promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftspr\u00fcfer (IDW) will always  detect  a  material  misstatement.

The report shows and explains the remuneration granted and owed to  the  individual  current  and  former  members  of  the  Board  of Management and the Supervisory Board of Bayerische Motoren Werke Aktiengesellschaft (BMW AG) in the financial year 2023. 1,2\n\nIn order to facilitate understanding, the basic features of the remuneration system applicable to the members of the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board, as applied in the 2023 financial year, are also set out below. In view of the fact that individual members of the Board of Management also received remuneration components from the remuneration system in effect in the 2018 financial year during the 2023 financial year, elements of these systems are also explained to the extent necessary for comprehension.\n\nPricewaterhouseCoopers GmbH Wirtschaftspr\u00fcfungsgesellschaft, Frankfurt am Main, Munich branch, has audited the Remuneration Report beyond the requirements of \u00a7 162 (3) Sentences 1  and  2 AktG.  The  Auditor's  Report  is  attached  to  this report.\n\n## I. REVIEW OF THE 2023 FINANCIAL YEAR FROM A REMUNERATION PERSPECTIVE\n\nThe 2023 financial year was very successful for the BMW  Group. A total of 2,554,183 vehicles were delivered - a new record for the BMW Group. The BMW brand defended its leading position in the global premium segment by selling just under 2.3 million delivered vehicles. The Rolls-Royce brand also achieved record sales. BMW Motorrad achieved the strongest sales in the Company's history in the year of its 100th anniversary.",

        "page_content": "The BMW Group generated a strong profit in the 2023 financial year. Group net profit amounted to \u20ac  12.2 billion, with \u20ac 11.3 billion attributable to BMW  AG shareholders, while the Group return on sales after tax amounted to 7.8 %. Under the leadership of the Board  of  Management,  the  Company  continued  to  drive  the BMW Group's transformation to electromobility forward in the reporting year. The BMW Group increased its sales of all-electric ve-hicles  at  a  significantly  greater  pace than  the  market  as  a whole and has an all-electric offering in every major segment. The proportion of total sales attributable to all-electric vehicles went up to around 15%.\n\nThe current remuneration system for the members of the Board of Management came into effect on 1 January 2021. The Annual General Meeting approved it on 12 May 2021 with a majority of 91.60% of the valid votes cast. The Supervisory Board did not resolve any changes to the remuneration system or the target remuneration in the remuneration levels set out for the members of the Board of Management in the 2023 financial year.\n\nIn December 2022, the Supervisory Board set ambitious targets linked to the variable remuneration of the members of the Board of Management for the 2023 financial year. Of the total variable target remuneration available, around 39% was linked to environmental, social or governance (ESG) targets. The Supervisory Board has set ambitious targets to reduce fleet carbon emissions in the EU and to increase all-electric vehicle sales. These serve as strategic focus targets that correspond to 50% of the longterm  variable  remuneration  (share-based  remuneration).  The Supervisory Board has thus once again incorporated the strategic  importance  of  accelerating  the  electrification  of  the  vehicle fleet into the remuneration for the members of the Board of Management. The Supervisory Board placed particular emphasis on environmental sustainability targets, which make up 50% of the long-term variable remuneration.\n\nThanks to its strong overall performance, the Board of Management exceeded both the financial and a large part of the nonfinancial targets for short-term variable remuneration (bonuses) for the 2023 financial year. \u2197 Bonus for the 2023 financial year The financial  target  tied  to  RoCE  in  the  Automotive  segment  which\n\nII. Outlook for the 2024 Financial Year\n\nmakes up part of the long-term variable remuneration (sharebased remuneration) component was also exceeded. In terms of the non-financial strategic focus targets for the long-term variable remuneration, the ambitious targets related to the reduction of  fleet  carbon  emissions  in  the EU  were  exceeded,  while  the BMW Group's sales targets for all -electric vehicles were not quite met in full. \u2197 Share-based remuneration for the financial year 2023\n\nIf  necessary,  and  in  the  interest  of  the  long-term  success  of BMW AG, the Supervisory Board may temporarily deviate from the remuneration system - as provided for in \u00a7 87a (2) Sentence 2 AktG. In accordance with G.11 of the German Corporate Governance Code dated 28 April 2022 ('GCGC'), the Supervisory Board has also reserved the right to make adjustments if extraordinary developments occur, such as significant acquisitions and disposals, or changes in accounting standards or tax regulations that have a significant impact. After due examination, it did not make use of these options for the 2023 financial year.\n\nThe composition of the Board of Management changed during the 2023 financial year. Mr Pieter Nota left the Board of Management on 31 October 2023 by mutual agreement as part of a succession arrangement. Dr Nicolas Peter left the Board of Management on 11 May 2023. This was also by mutual agreement as  part  of  a  succession  arrangement. \u2197 Premature  termination  of activities and post-contractual non-competition clause Mr Walter Mertl was appointed as the member of the Board of Management responsible  for  Finance  on  12  May 2023. Mr Jochen Goller was appointed as the member of the Board of Management responsible for  Customer,  Brands,  Sales  on  1  November  2023.  From the start date of his second period of office on 1 July 2023, Mr Frank Weber was eligible to receive the target remuneration in the second remuneration level,  which  is  available  to  members  of  the Board of Management from their second period of office.\n\nIncorporation. In the 2023 financial year, Dr  Martin Kimmich was appointed by the court to replace Mr Manfred Schoch as a member of the Supervisory Board on 18 January 2023. Mr Schoch left the Supervisory Board on 31 December 2022. On 23 January 2023, Dr Kimmich was appointed as the first deputy chair by the Supervisory Board and as a member of the Personnel and Audit Committee. As the first deputy chair, he is also a member of the Presiding Board and the legally required Mediation Committee. Apart  from  this,  the  composition  of  the  Personnel  Committee, which is responsible for the preparation of remuneration decisions in accordance with the Supervisory Board's rules of procedure, did not change in the 2023 financial year. The Supervisory Board awarded a contract to new external remuneration consultants in the 2023 financial year. The Remuneration Report for the 2022 financial year was confirmed by the Annual General Meeting on 11 May 2023 with a majority of 94.14% of the valid votes cast. In view of the high level of approval, there was no reason to rethink the implementation of the current remuneration system or the manner of reporting. Changes were made to make certain issues clearer.\n\n## II. OUTLOOK FOR THE 2024 FINANCIAL YEAR\n\nThe remuneration system and the target remuneration for the remuneration levels of the members of the Board of Management, as described in this report for the 2023 financial year, will continue to apply unchanged in the 2024 financial year. In December 2023, the Supervisory Board set the targets for variable remuneration for the 2024 financial year on the basis of a proposal by the Personnel Committee. A resolution was passed to raise the required level of performance for the earnings component of the bonus for the Board of Management, which remains limited to 180% of the target remuneration.\n\nThere are no plans to change the remuneration system for members of the Supervisory Board for the 2024 financial year.\n\nThe remuneration system for the members of the Supervisory Board is set out in Article 16 of the Articles of Incorporation and provides only for fixed remuneration. It was confirmed by the Annual  General  Meeting  on  12  May  2021  with  a  majority  of 99.40% of the valid votes cast, and implemented for the 2023 financial year in accordance with the provisions of the Articles of",

Principles of the remuneration system and the contribution of remuneration to the promotion of the Company's business strategy and its long-term development\n\nThe  remuneration  system  which  has  been  in  place  since  the 2021 financial year complies with the provisions of the German Stock  Corporation  Act  (AktG)  and  the  recommendations  and suggestions of the GCGC. The Supervisory Board has applied the following principles in designing the remuneration system for the Board of Management:\n\npre\n\n- -The remuneration structure is geared towards sustainable  and  long-term  development  of  the  Company. Therefore, variable remuneration components are -dominantly granted on the basis of a assessment.\n\nIII. Remuneration of the Members of the Board of Management\n\nThe BMW Group aims to be the most successful and sustainable premium provider of individual mobility. The business strategy focuses on the customer and the provision of sustainable individual mobility in the premium segment, taking into account high profitability, in order to secure the Company's independence in the future. The remuneration system contributes to the implementation of the business strategy and the sustainable and long term development of the Company. It also takes into account the concerns of the Company's important stakeholders (in particular, shareholders, customers and employees). The incentive effects of the various remuneration components have a complementary effect.\n\nlong\n\noffers\n\n- the multi-year -The fixed basic remuneration counteracts the temptation to take disproportionately high risks in order to achieve shortterm goals, and thus contributes to the -term development of the Company. It ensures a minimum income appropriate to the tasks and responsibilities of a member of the Board of Management.\n- -The  total  remuneration  of  the  members  of  the  Board  of Management is commensurate with their tasks performance as well as the Company's situation.\n- -The remuneration system ensures that both positive and negative  developments  are  appropriately  reflected  in  the remuneration ('pay for performance').\n- -The  remuneration  system  takes  into account both performance of the entire Board of Management and the achievement of individual targets.\n- -The remuneration system observes the principle consistency between the remuneration systems in Company:  the  remuneration systems for the Board of Management, executives and employees of BMW AG are all designed in a similar way.\n- and the of the -The variable bonus is divided into two parts, which influence behaviour in different ways. The earnings -related component of the bonus rewards recipients for achieving the  Company's  financial  targets  in  the  vesting  year,  and promotes the earnings-related parts of the business strategy.  In  contrast,  the  performance  component  of  the bonus is based on non-financial performance criteria, which are also derived from the business strategy. In this respect, the performance component of the bonus also particular incentives to encourage individuals to pursue the goals of the business strategy consistently for the long- term development of the Company. These goals do not have to be directly reflected in the key financial indicators for a given vesting year.\n- -The total remuneration is in line with market practice both in terms of amount and structure, and takes into account the size, complexity and economic situation of the Company.\n- -The amount of the variable share-based remuneration also depends  on  the  fulfilment  of  financial  and  non-financial objectives derived from the business strategy, since 50% of the target personal cash investment amount earmarked for share purchases is linked to a financial key indicator (RoCE in the Automotive segment), and 50% is linked to strategic\n\nfocus targets. The obligation to use the total net amount to purchase shares of common stock in the Company and to hold these shares for at least four years is a  share ownership guideline  that  strengthens  the  entrepreneurial  long-term orientation of the Board of Management. Implementing the corporate strategy sustainably by taking appropriate decisions  also  creates  lasting  value  for  the  shareholders, and thus regularly provides the basis for positive long-term capital market performance. Due to the substantial investment  and  the  fixed  holding  period  associated  with these shares, members  of  the Board of Management participate in the long-term positive (and negative) development of the Company, as reflected in the share price and dividend trends.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Determination and review of the remuneration system and individual remuneration\n\nDetermining the system and structure of Board of Management remuneration, and reviewing it regularly, is a task of the full Supervisory Board, as is determining the individual level of remuneration of members of the Board of Management. The Personnel Committee of the Supervisory Board assumes a preparatory function.\n\nIII. Remuneration of the Members of the Board of Management\n\nIn  accordance  with  the  remuneration  system,  the  Supervisory Board - acting on the proposal of the Personnel Committee sets specific target remuneration for each individual member of the Board of Management for the upcoming financial year, as well as the performance criteria associated with the variable remuneration components provided for in the remuneration system.\n\nThe total target remuneration is composed of the fixed remuneration and the variable remuneration. Within the variable target remuneration,  the  proportion  of  share-based  remuneration  as long-term variable remuneration exceeds the share of the bonus as short-term variable remuneration. The share of the individual remuneration components is within the ranges specified by the remuneration system.\n\n## Overview of total target remuneration for members of the Board of Management 1\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Supervisory Board reviews the remuneration system annually to ensure it is appropriate in terms of structure, target and maximum remuneration, as well as actual remuneration. The Supervisory  Board  also  takes  remuneration  studies  into  account when assessing the market conformity of the target and maximum remuneration, as well as when assessing actual remuneration in horizontal terms. Due to the size and structure of the BMW Group, DAX companies are used as a comparison group while taking revenues, employee headcounts and market capitalisation into consideration. This ensures that the main competitors of BMW AG and other global companies are factored in. Vertically,  the  Supervisory  Board  compares  the  remuneration  of members of the Board of Management with the remuneration of senior executives and with the average remuneration of employees employed by BMW AG in Germany in areas inside and outside the scope of collective bargaining agreements, including in terms of how they have changed over a period of several years. Recommendations from independent external remuneration experts, as well as suggestions from investor and analyst circles, may also be included in the deliberations. For the 2023 financial year, the review has shown that the target, maximum and actual remuneration are appropriate.\n\n## Target remuneration for the 2023 financial year\n\nThe following tables show the individual target remuneration of the members of the Board of Management and the relative share of the respective remuneration component in the total target remuneration. The  maximum  remuneration  and  remuneration earned for the 2023 financial year are shown below. \u2197 Maximum remuneration vested in the 2023 financial year (vesting year)\n\n<!-- image -->",

See \u2197 Premature termination of activities and post-contractual non-competition clause.\n- 5 Second remuneration level since 1 July 2023.\n\nThe targets set and the extent to which they have been achieved, as  well  as  the  specific  amounts  associated  with  the  earnings component of the bonus for the 2023 financial year, are shown in  the  following  tables. In  the 2023  financial  year,  BMW AG's share  of  profit  attributable  to  shareholders  was  \u20ac 11.3 billion, and the Group post-tax return on sales was 7.8%. Based on the allocation matrix approved by the Supervisory Board, this provides an earnings factor of 1.680, which corresponds to a target achievement level of 168%.\n\n## Performance component of the bonus\n\nThe performance component of the bonus rewards the achievement of certain non-financial targets. Before the beginning of t he financial year, the Supervisory Board sets these targets in the form of various non-financial  performance  criteria  and  associated metrics. The performance criteria are derived primarily from the  corporate  strategy,  long-term  corporate  planning  and  the business development planning done for the following year. The targets are divided into individual targets for the individual members of the Board of Management (departmental targets) and collective targets for the entire Board of Management (interdepartmental  targets).  The  Supervisory  Board  has  discretion  in weighting the performance criteria. Approximately 10% of the target amount for the performance bonus is intended to be allocated to the departmental targets. Departmental targets can be department-specific  targets  or  contributions  to  shared  targets measured individually for each department. The remainder of the target amount for the performance bonus (amounting to approximately 90%) should be associated with interdepartmental, non financial targets. In t his regard, around 50% of the target amount should be connected to the achievement of non-financial targets relating to environmental, social and governance (ESG targets).\n\n<!-- image -->",

The  performance factor  for  the  bonus  was  determined  from  the  partial  performance factors, with a weighting of 10% for the departmental targets and 90% for the interdepartmental targets, in each case in relation to the target amount of the performance component of the bonus. With regard to the interdepartmental targets, 50% of the weighting is for non-financial environmental, social and governance (ESG) targets, and 40% is for other non-financial targets, in each case in relation to the target amount of the performance component of the bonus.\n\nIII. Remuneration of the Members of the Board of Management\n\ntarget The  results  of  comparative  studies  and  calculations  vis-\u00e0-vis competitors were also used to assess individual metrics.  In addition to a review of performance in 2023, the Supervisory Board carried out a trend review covering several financial years. In doing so, it assessed the effects of decisions, measures and the overall course set in previous financial years on the 2023 financial year and also estimated the significance of the performance in 2023 for the future development of the Company.\n\nThe defined quantitative and qualitative metrics include indicators such as vehicle sales, segment shares, the share of sales for electrified and all-electric vehicles and the share of BMW brand vehicles with remote software upgrade capability. Other metrics included assessments of the quality of the customer experience compared to the competition, the R&D ratio, spending on employee training and development and diversity targets.\n\nThe leadership  performance  of  the  individual  members  of  the Board of Management was assessed along with the overall performance of the Board of Management as a whole. With regard to the departmental targets, the Supervisory Board assessed the individual performance of each member of the Board of Management. With regard to the interdepartmental targets, the Supervisory Board considered the Board of Management as a team and assessed the performance of all the members of the Board of Management  as  a  whole.  The  Supervisory  Board's  decisionmaking process is based on a detailed, documented analysis of performance as measured against all the agreed criteria, as well as in-depth discussions at Personnel Committee and full Supervisory Board level. As a basis for the targets set in the previous year and the assessment process following the financial year, the Supervisory Board was guided, in particular, by the quantitative and qualitative metrics that were defined in the corporate planning before the beginning of the financial year.\n\n## Overview of targets of the performance component of the bonus for the financial year 2023 1\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1 Based on the target amount of the performance component of the bonus.\n\n- 2 Individual assessment for each member of the Board of Management.\n- 3 Collective assessment of the Board of Management as a team.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## (2) Share-based remuneration for the 2023 financial year\n\nAs part of the share-based remuneration as a variable long-term component of remuneration, the members of the Board of Management receive a cash payment earmarked for investment in BMW shares of common stock (the 'personal cash investment amount'). This amount depends on the achievement of certain financial and non-financial targets in the past financial year (vesting year). The members of the Board of Management are obliged to invest their personal cash investment amounts (less taxes and duties) in BMW shares of common stock immediately after disbursement, and to hold these shares for a period of at least four years (share ownership guideline). The holding period remains in effect even if the member leaves the Board of Management.\n\n## Personal cash investment amount\n\nThe personal  cash  investment  amount  for  the  2023  financial year will be paid as part of the next payroll run after the Annual General Meeting in 2024. The size of this amount depends on the target amount, the RoCE achieved in the Automotive segment  and  the  degree  to  which  certain  strategic  focus  targets were achieved in the vesting year. The personal cash investment amount is limited to a maximum of 180% of the target amount and is calculated as follows:\n\n## Overview of share-based remuneration 1\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 1 Simplified depiction.\n- 2 At least two strategic focus targets and their proportion of the target amount are determined by the Supervisory Board.\n- 3 Exemplary illustration of price development.\n- 4 Payment of the personal cash investment amount, acquisition of shares and the start of the four-year holding period occur as part of the next payroll run after the Annual General Meeting at which the annual financial statements for the vesting year are presented.\n\ndetermined by multiplying the RoCE factor for the vesting year by 50% of the individual target amount.\n\n## Strategic focus targets component of the personal cash investment amount\n\nThe Supervisory Board sets at least two strategic focus targets before the start of the vesting year. It derives these targets from the corporate strategy and corporate planning. It then sets a minimum, target and maximum value for each strategic focus target, and assigns a factor  to  each of  these  values.  If  the  minimum value is not reached, the factor for that target is 0. If the target value is reached, the factor for that target is 1.00. If the maximum value is reached or exceeded, the factor for that target is 1.80. The  strategic  focus  targets  component  of  the  personal  cash\n\ninvestment amount is determined in a two-step process. In the first step, the factor for the vesting year achieved for the relevant strategic focus target is multiplied by the share of the individual target amount attributable to this target. In the second step, the values determined for the individual strategic focus targets using this calculation are added together. If two strategic focus targets are set, each strategic focus target accounts for 25% of the individual target amount, unless the Supervisory Board decides on a different weighting. If more than two strategic focus targets are set,  the  Supervisory  Board  determines  the  weighting  of  each target.\n\n## Personal cash investment amount =\n\nRoCE component + strategic focus target component\n\n## Target amount for the personal cash investment amount\n\nThe target amounts for the individual members of the Board of Management for the 2023 financial year are presented in the table \u2197 Overview of share-based remuneration for financial year 2023 .\n\n## RoCE component of the personal cash investment amount\n\nBefore the beginning of the relevant vesting year, the Supervisory Board sets minimum, target and maximum values for the RoCE in the Automotive segment in the vesting year on the basis of corporate planning, and assigns a RoCE factor to each of these values. If the minimum value is not reached, the RoCE factor is 0. If the target value is reached, the RoCE factor is 1.00. If the maximum value is reached or exceeded, the RoCE factor is 1.80.

In  December 2022, the Supervisory Board determined the following values for the RoCE component for the vesting year 2023, based on the long-term  corporate  planning:  minimum  value:  12%  (target achievement  50%),  target  value:  16%  (target  achievement 100%), maximum value: 21% (target achievement 180%).

        "page_content": "## 6. Retirement benefits\n\nThe  retirement  benefits  system  provides  for  the  Company  to make annual contributions to a savings account for every year that members of the Board of Management are appointed. After they are confirmed, pension entitlements become vested when the employment relationship has existed for one year. Members of the Board of Management receive a disability pension in the event of invalidity. Retired members of the Board of Management are entitled to retirement benefits after the age of 62 at the earliest and after leaving the Board. If a member of the Board of Management dies before becoming entitled to a retirement or invalidity benefit, a surviving spouse or registered partner is entitled to a survivor's benefit; otherwise, surviving children are entitled to a survivor's benefit depending on their age and level of education. The amount of the benefits to be paid is determined on the basis of the amount accrued in each Board member's individual pension savings account. This figure is in turn based on the annual contributions and annual profit participation depending on the form of investment. For the contributions made, there is a guaranteed minimum interest rate equal to the maximum interest rates specified in the German actuarial reserve regulation (Deckungsr\u00fcckstellungsverordnung). The payment is made as a lump sum or in annual instalments at the discretion of the member of the Board of Management. For entitlements arising before 2016, there is an option to receive payment as a lifelong monthly pension or in a combined form. In the event of death or invalidity, a minimum benefit in the amount of the potential annual pension contributions that could have been made up to the age of 60 is approved. This benefit cannot exceed ten years of contributions.\n\nIII. Remuneration of the Members of the Board of Management\n\nmillion were incurred. These benefits correspond in their entirety to allocations to pension provisions in accordance with IAS 19.\n\n## Pension entitlements 2023\n\n| in \u20ac                       | Service cost in accordance  with IFRS for the  financial year 2023   | Cash value of entitlements  to pension benefits  in accordance with IFRS  as at 31 December 2023   |\n|----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 712,729                    | 5,749,540                                                            | Oliver Zipse                                                                                       |\n| 66,667                     | 1,039,801                                                            | Jochen Goller 1                                                                                    |\n| 407,533                    | 2,704,634                                                            | Ilka Horstmeier                                                                                    |\n| 254,444                    | 807,853                                                              | Walter Mertl 2                                                                                     |\n| Milan Nedeljkovi\u0107  407,391 |                                                                      | 3,174,055                                                                                          |\n| 407,516                    | 2,336,557                                                            | Pieter Nota 3                                                                                      |\n| 166,667                    | 4,038,570                                                            | Nicolas Peter 4                                                                                    |\n| 408,504                    | 1,174,735                                                            | Joachim Post                                                                                       |\n| 407,525                    | 1,845,023                                                            | Frank Weber                                                                                        |\n| Total                      |                                                                      | 3,238,976  22,870,768                                                                              |\n\n- 1 Member of the Board of Management since 1 November 2023.\n- 2 Member of the Board of Management since 12 May 2023.\n- 3 Member of the Board of Management until 31 October 2023, service contract until 31 July 2024,\n- see \u2197 Premature termination of activities and post-contractual non-competition clause.\n- 4 Member of the Board of Management until 11 May 2023, service contract until 31 May 2023,\n- see \u2197 Premature termination of activities and post-contractual non-competition clause.\n\nMembers of the Board of Management who retire immediately after their service on the Board, or who are deemed to be in an equivalent  position,  are  entitled  to  acquire  vehicles  and  other BMW Group products and services at conditions that also apply to BMW pensioners and to lease BMW Group vehicles in accordance with the guidelines applicable to senior heads of departments.

Malus and clawback provisions\n\nThe current remuneration system provides for the possibility of withholding variable remuneration (malus) and reclaiming variable  remuneration  already  paid  out  (clawback)  under  certain conditions. The rules allow the Supervisory Board to withhold or reclaim  variable  remuneration  in  the  event  of  certain  serious compliance-related violations (compliance malus and/or compliance clawback). These provisions can also be applied where variable remuneration components linked to the achievement of certain targets have been paid out on the basis of incorrect calculation bases or incorrect financial statements. Remuneration can also be withheld or reclaimed after an individual's departure from the Board of Management.\n\nThe Supervisory Board has not identified any reason to withhold or reclaim variable remuneration components in the  2023 financial year.\n\n## 8. Premature termination of activities and post-contractual non-competition clause\n\nBoard of Management service contracts provide for severance pay to be paid to the Board member in the event of premature termination by the Company without due cause, the amount of which is limited to a maximum of two years' remuneration (severance payment cap). The member will not be compensated for more than the remaining term of the service contract. If the remaining term of the contract is less than two years, the severance payment is reduced proportionately. The annual remuneration paid generally includes the base salary, the target amount of the bonus and target amount of the personal cash investment amount, unless the relevant target amount was not achieved in the  previous  year.  In  this  case,  the  bonus  that  was  actually granted or the personal cash investment amount that was actually disbursed will apply.\n\nThere  are  no  specific  severance  arrangements  covering  early termination of a Board member's mandate due to a change of control or in connection with a takeover offer.\n\nIn the event of death or invalidity, special rules apply for waiving the  holding  period  for  shares  of  common  stock  that  were  acquired with share-based remuneration components.

Entitlements to other variable  remuneration  components  (bonus,  personal  cash  investment amount) are forfeited as soon as the y exceed the target amounts.\n\nA one-year post-contractual non-competition clause has been agreed with the Board members under specified circumstances against payment of a remuneration amount. Service contracts provide for the payment of a monthly waiting allowance in the amount of the applicable monthly base salary for the duration of the post-contractual non-competition clause. In accordance with Recommendation G.13 of the GCGC, any severance payment is offset against the waiting allowance. The same applies to other income from third parties, except remuneration for Supervisory Board  appointments  approved  during  the  term  of  office.  The Company may unilaterally waive the requirement to comply with the post-contractual non-competition clause.\n\nDr Nicolas Peter left the Board of Management on 11  May 2023 by mutual agreement as part of a succession arrangement. He received fixed remuneration (base salary and other remuneration) of \u20ac 0.05 million for the remaining term of his service contract up to 31 May 2023.

Remuneration of the Members of the Board of Management\n\nremuneration will continue to be paid to him on the contractually agreed due dates until the end of his employment contract; his remuneration will not be settled or paid early; he will not receive a termination payment. For the period from 1 November to 31 December 2023, he received fixed remuneration (base salary and other remuneration) of \u20ac 0.2 million, a bonus of \u20ac 0.3 million and a personal cash investment amount of \u20ac 0.3 million (all pro rata). The pension contribution comes to \u20ac 0.07 million for the period from 1 November to 31 December 2023. For the period from 1 January to 31 July 2024, his base salary comes to \u20ac 0.6 million, with a maximum bonus of \u20ac 0.7 million and a maximum personal cash investment amount of \u20ac 0.7 million. The pension contribution for the relevant portion of the 2024 financial year is \u20ac 0.2 million. A one-year post-contractual non-competition clause  applies.  For  the  period  from  1 August  2024  to  31 July 2025, the waiting allowance contractually owed to him amounts to \u20ac 1.1 million.\n\n## 9. Remuneration granted and owed to members of the Board of Management pursuant to \u00a7 162 of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG)\n\nThe following tables \u2197 Remuneration granted and owed show the remuneration granted and owed to the members of the Board of Management in office during the reporting year in accordance with \u00a7 162 AktG. The remuneration shown for the members of the Board of Management who left during the year also includes the remuneration granted and owed in the reporting year after they leave the company.\n\nThe tables include all amounts received by the individual members of the Board of Management in the reporting period ('remuneration granted') and all remuneration legally due but not yet received ('remuneration owed').\n\nIn addition to actual amounts received, 'remuneration granted' in the reporting year is also assumed to exist if the activity on which the remuneration component is based has been fully performed by the member of the Board of Management as of the\n\nbalance  sheet  date,  and  if  all  conditions  for  entitlement  have been met.\n\nThus, in addition to the fixed remuneration components, the following variable remuneration components are reported as remuneration granted for the 2023 financial year within the meaning of \u00a7 162 of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG):\n\n- -Bonus for the 2023 financial year (to be paid out in 2024)\n- -Share-based remuneration (personal cash investment amount) for the 2023 financial year (to be paid out in  2024)\n\n(matchin\n\n- -Share-based remuneration component component) for vesting year 2018, due to the expiry of the four-year holding period in the 2023 financial year (paid out in 2023)\n\nThus, the remuneration granted and owed includes all remuneration components earned through the activities of the members of the Board of Management in the 2023 financial year. In addition, it includes remuneration components already earned as a result of activity in previous financial years, but for which the respective member of the Board of Management's payment entitlement  only  arose  due  to  the  occurrence  of  conditions  in  the 2023 financial year.\n\nIn addition to the absolute amount of remuneration, the relative share of the relevant remuneration component in the total remuneration granted and owed is also shown. For the sake of completeness, the individual service cost in accordance with IAS 19 for the Company pension scheme is also shown, although this service cost is not classified as granted or owed remuneration within the meaning of \u00a7 162 AktG.",

In the 2023 financial year, the matching component of the share-based remuneration for vesting year 2018 was paid out. Under the share-based remuneration programme for financial year 2018, the members of the Board of Management in office in 2018 received an amount equal to 45% of the gross bonus as additional cash remuneration from the Company\n\nfor financial year 2018 (the investment component), which they were each required to invest in shares of the Company's common stock after taking taxes and deductions into account. Under a matching plan, the member of the Board of Management receives from the Company - at the Company's discretion - either one additional share of common stock or the equivalent in cash (share-based  remuneration  component/matching  component) for every three shares of common stock held after the four-year holding  period.  The  investment  component  for  financial  year 2018 was paid out immediately after the 2019 Annual General Meeting on 16 May 2019, and the shares of common stock were acquired on 17 May 2019 at a price of \u20ac 65.84. The holding period for the shares of common stock acquired in 2019 expired on 16 May 2023. The Company settled the matching component in\n\ncash based on a reference price of \u20ac 98.70.

        "page_content": "## IV. REMUNERATION OF THE MEMBERS OF THE SUPERVISORY BOARD\n\n## 1. Articles of incorporation and procedure\n\nThe regulation governing remuneration for the Su pervisory Board is set out in \u00a7 16 of the Articles of Incorporation, and specifies both the remuneration system to be used and the precise framework for calculating the remuneration due to the members of the Supervisory Board. The regulation was adopted by  the Annual General  Meeting  on  14  May  2020  and  confirmed  on 12 May 2021 with a majority of 99.40% of the valid votes cast.\n\nIV. Remuneration of the Members of the Supervisory Board\n\nSupervisory  Board  member  who  has  no  additional  remuneration-relevant  functions.  The  Chair  of  the  Audit  Committee  receives two-and-a-quarter times the amount, the Chairs of other Supervisory Board committees twice the amount, each member of the Audit Committee twice the amount, and each member of another committee one-and-a-half times the amount of the remuneration paid to a Supervisory Board member, provided the relevant committee convened on at least three days during the financial year. If a member of the Supervisory Board exercises more than one of the functions referred to above, their remuneration is measured only on the basis of the function receiving the highest amount.\n\n## 2. Principles and elements of remuneration\n\nIn  the  event  of  changes in the composition of the Supervisory Board  during  the  year,  or  if  additional  remuneration-relevant functions are performed, remuneration is calculated on a proportionate basis.\n\nIn addition, each member of the Supervisory Board receives an attendance fee of \u20ac 2,000 per meeting for each meeting of the Supervisory Board (plenary) in which he or she participates. This also applies to participation by telephone or video link. If they attend more than one meeting on the same day, the meetings are not remunerated separately. A continuous session on two consecutive days is treated as one session.\n\nThe Supervisory Board remuneration is structured as a purely fixed  remuneration  in  line  with  suggestion  G.18  of  the  GCGC. Fixed remuneration strengthens the independence of the  Supervisory Board in advising and monitoring the Board of Management.  The  structure  and  amount  of  the  fixed  remuneration should ensure that highly qualified individuals can be proposed to the Annual General Meeting for membership of the Supervisory Board. This promotes the quality of advice and oversight, which contributes to the Company's sustainable and long-term development.\n\nIn accordance with the Articles of Incorporation, each member of the Supervisory Board of BMW AG who does not exercise any additional function relevant to remuneration receives fixed remuneration of \u20ac 200,000 p.a.\n\nThe GCGC recommends that exercising the functions of the chair and deputy chair of the Supervisory Board should also be considered when determining the level of remuneration, along with any committees an individual chairs or sits on (Suggestion G.17). This is to take account of the extra time commitment associated with these positions. The Articles of Incorporation of BMW AG also take account of the requirements for the Audit Committee and its Chairman. They stipulate that the Chairman of the Supervisory  Board  shall  receive  three  times  the  amount,  and  each Deputy Chairman twice the amount, of remuneration paid to a\n\nThe remuneration and the attendance fee are only paid after the end of the respective financial year. Furthermore, the company reimburses each member of the Supervisory Board for their reasonable expenses. In order to be able to perform his duties, the Chairman of the Supervisory Board is provided with secretariat and chauffeur services.\n\n## 3. Remuneration granted and owed to members of the Supervisory Board pursuant to \u00a7 162 of the German Stock  Corporation Act (AktG)\n\nThe following table shows the remuneration granted and owed to the members of the Supervisory Board in the 2023 financial year in accordance with \u00a7 162 (1) Sentence 1 German Stock Corporation Act (AktG). The activity on which the remuneration for the 2023 financial year is based was fully performed by the balance sheet date. Therefore, the remuneration for the Supervisory Board activities is classified as granted for the 2023 financial year, even if the payment of the Supervisory Board remuneration (including the attendance fee) was made after the end of the 2023 financial year.\n\n## Overview of remuneration of the members of the Supervisory Board\u00b9\n\n|                                   |   Factor | Amount in \u20ac p. a. 3   |\n|-----------------------------------|----------|-----------------------|\n| Member of Supervisory Board       |     1    | 200,000               |\n| Chairman Supervisory Board        |     3    | 600,000               |\n| Deputy Chairman Supervisory Board |     2    | 400,000               |\n| Chairman of the Audit Committee 2 |     2.25 | 450,000               |\n| Chairman of other committee 2     |     2    | 400,000               |\n| Member of the Audit Committee 2   |     2    | 400,000               |\n| Member of other committee 2       |     1.5  | 300,000               |",

COMPARISON OF CHANGE IN REMUNERATION AND EARNINGS PURSUANT TO \u00a7 162 (1) SENTENCE 2 NO. 2 OF THE GERMAN STOCK CORPORATION ACT (AKTG)\n\nPursuant to \u00a7 162 (1) Sentence 2 No. 2 German Stock Corporation Act (AktG), the following table shows the change in earnings, the annual change in the remuneration of the members of the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board, and the annual change in the average remuneration of the employees on a full-time equivalent basis over the last five financial years.\n\nV. Comparison of Change in Remuneration and Earnings\n\nThe presentation of average employee remuneration is based on the average remuneration of all employees of BMW AG on a full time  equivalent  basis.  In  the 2023  financial  year,  this  was 83,383 people. Worldwide, the BMW Group employed 154,950 people at 31 December 2023. In order to calculate the average employee remuneration presented, the principles applicable to the  calculation  of  the  remuneration  granted  and  owed  to  the members  of  the  Board  of  Management  and  the  Supervisory Board  pursuant  to  \u00a7  162 (1)  Sentence  1  AktG  were  applied accordingly.\n\nFor the members of the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board, the remuneration granted and owed in the relevant financial year is presented within the meaning of \u00a7 162 (1) Sentence 1 AktG.  The  remuneration  granted  and  owed  to  former members of the Board of Management includes any variable remuneration from previous vesting years and any remuneration from any contracts of employment that remained valid beyond the  end  of  their  mandate,  as  well  as  retirement  benefit  plans (pension  payments,  payments  from  the  retirement  capital  account), fringe benefits and any waiting allowances paid.\n\nThe change in earnings is presented on the basis of BMW AG's net profit for the year in accordance with the German Commercial Code (HGB). In addition, the changes in the k ey indicators 'earnings attributable to shareholders of BMW AG' and 'Group return on sales after tax' are reported, as these key indicators are relevant for both the calculation of the variable remuneration of the members of the Board of Management (earnings component of the bonus) and the performance-related remuneration of managers and employees.",

OTHER CONSIDERATIONS\n\nBMW Group companies did not grant any loans to members of the Board of Management or the Supervisory Board in the 2023 financial year, nor did they enter into any contingent liabilities in their favour. In the year under review, members of the Board of Management and the  Supervisory  Board  concluded  contracts with BMW Group companies for the purchase of vehicles, other services  (maintenance  and  repair  work)  and  cash  deposits  at arm's length conditions.\n\nThe Company maintains a financial loss liability insurance policy for the members of the Board of Management and Supervisory Board. The insurance provides cover for liability  claims  and  protects  the  private  assets  of  members  of BMW AG's Board of Management and Supervisory Board if a claim  is  made  against  them  for  financial  loss  in  the  course  of exercising  their  function  as  a  corporate  entity.

AUDITOR'S REPORT\n\nTo Bayerische Motoren Werke Aktiengesellschaft, M\u00fcnchen\n\nWe have audited the remuneration report of Bayerische Motoren Werke Aktiengesellschaft, M\u00fcnchen, for the financial year from January 1, 2023 to December 31, 2023 including the related disclosures, which was prepared to comply with \u00a7 [Article] 162 AktG [Aktiengesetz: German Stock Corporation Act].\n\n## Responsibilities of the Executive Directors and the Supervisory Board\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Restriction on use\n\nWe issue this auditor's report on the basis of the engagement agreed with Bayerische Motoren Werke Aktiengesellschaft. The audit has been performed only for purposes of the company and the auditor's report is solely intended to inform the company as to the results of the audit. Our responsibility for the audit and for our auditor's report is only towards the company in accordance with this engagement. The auditor's report is not intended for any third parties to base any (financial) decisions thereon. We do not assume any responsibility, duty of care or liability towards third parties; no third parties are included in the scope of protection  of  the  underlying  engagement.  \u00a7  334  BGB  [B\u00fcrgerliches Gesetzbuch: German Civil Code], according to which objections arising from a contract may also be raised against third parties, is not waived.\n\nMunich, March 14, 2024\n\nPricewaterhouseCoopers GmbH Wirtschaftspr\u00fcfungsgesellschaft\n\nPetra Justenhoven Wirtschaftspr\u00fcferin (German Public Auditor)\n\nMichael Popp Wirtschaftspr\u00fcfer (German Public Auditor)\n\nIn making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the preparation of the remuneration report including the related disclosures. The objective of this is to plan and perform audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the company's internal control. An audit also includes  evaluating  the  appropriateness  of  accounting  policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by the  executive  directors  and  the  supervisory  board,  as  well  as evaluating  the  overall  presentation  of  remuneration  report  including the related disclosures.\n\nWe believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.\n\n## Audit Opinion\n\nIn our opinion, based on the findings of our audit, the remuneration report for the financial year from January 1, 2023 to December 31 2023, including the related disclosures, complies in all material respects with the accounting provisions of \u00a7 162 AktG.\n\nThe executive directors and the supervisory board of Bayerische Motoren Werke Aktiengesellschaft are responsible for the preparation of the remuneration report, including the related disclosures, that complies with the requirements of \u00a7 162 AktG. The executive directors and the supervisory board are also responsible for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of a remuneration report, including the related disclosures, that is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\n## Auditor's Responsibilities\n\nOur responsibility is to express an opinion on this remuneration report, including the related disclosures, based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with German generally accepted standards for the audit of financial statements promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftspr\u00fcfer (Institute of Public Auditors in Germany) (IDW). Those standards require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the remuneration report,  including  the  related  disclosures,  is  free  from  material misstatement.\n\nAn audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts including the related disclosures stated in the remuneration report. The procedures selected depend on t he auditor's  judgment.  This  includes  the  assessment  of the  risks  of material misstatement of the remuneration report including the related disclosures, whether due to fraud or error.\n\n## Reference to an Other Matter - Formal Audit of the Remuneration Report according to \u00a7 162 AktG\n\nThe audit of the content of the remuneration report described in this auditor's report includes the formal audit of the remuneration report required by \u00a7 162 Abs. [paragraph] 3 AktG, including the issuance of a report on this audit. As we express an unqualified audit opinion on the content of the remuneration report, this audit opinion includes that the information required by \u00a7 162 Abs. 1 and 2 AktG has been disclosed in all material respects in the remuneration report.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The methodology used to calculate CO2 emissions changed in the reporting year 2023 for the items 'Purchased Goods and services' and 'Logistics - material supply of the plants and distribution of vehicles'. The prior-year figures have been adjusted retrospectively.\n- 2 Carbon emissions (excluding climate-impacting gases other than carbon dioxide) generated by vehicle production (BMW Group plants and BMW Motorcycle, excluding partner plants and contract manufacturing) and by other BMW Group locations not directly related to production (e.g. research centres, sales centres, office buildings).\n- 3 This amount includes 15,881 t CO2 from the direct use of biomass.\n- 4 Calculation of Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions, using the operational control approach in accordance with the GHG Protocol. Leased space without the direct influence of the BMW Group on energy supply is therefore not included.\n- 5 Includes the emissions of company cars and function-related vehicles of the BMW Group plants, as well as the 12 major markets. Emissions are preferably calculated on the basis of tank refills. This is the case for the plants and/or markets in Australia, Austria, Brazil, France, Germany, Hungary, India, Italy (only Alphabet Italia S.p.A. and BMW Bank GmbH, Milan), Japan, Mexico, South Africa, South Korea (only BMW Financial Services Korea Co., Ltd., Seoul), Thailand and the UK. In the remaining cases, they are determined based on kilometres driven. For the USA, the data are partly extrapolated for 2023 because the information was not yet available for the entire period at the time the data was collected. For BMW Italia S.p.A. and BMW Italia Retail S.r.l., values for the reporting period are calculated based on average kilometres per day. For system-related reasons, the refuelling of company vehicles includes both business and private trips, except refuelling paid for by employees themselves.\n- 6 Emissions from company cars (Scope 1) are also included on a pro-rata basis under employee commuting and use phase (both Scope 3). A distinction in the systems is currently not possible.\n- 7 The increase in this metric is the result of the scope being increased as compared to the previous year. Reporting was only submitted for Germany and the international test sites up to and including 2022. During the 2023 reporting year, all BMW Group plants and the 12 major markets were integrated into the figure. A calculation based on the Scope from 2022 results in a comparative value for 2023 of 80,869 t CO2 (+5.7% compared to previous year). No retrospective adjustment was made. As a result, the figures for 2023 are not directly comparable with previous years.\n- 8 As a result of the extensive travel restrictions in place during the pandemic, 2019 is used as a base year for more meaningful comparisons in terms of civil aviation.\n- 9 Scope 2 emissions calculated using the market-based method in accordance with the GHG Protocol Scope 2 guidance; mainly based on the emissions factors for electricity, district heating and fuels reported by the VDA (each in the latest version dated 12/2023) and occasionally using local emissions factors; alternative calculation using the location-based method: 1,195,818 t CO2.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Each vehicle is assigned an average value based on the CO2e assessment of individual transport movements. The values in the time series were adjusted to reflect the new methodology. The emission factors were also adjusted retrospectively (values prior to change in methodology and adjustment of transport logistics emission factors, excluding aftersales logistics: 2019: 1,454,534 t CO2e, 2020: 1,225,688 t CO2e, 2021: 1,748,700 t CO2e, 2022: 2,100,161 t CO2e) \u2197 Glossary.\n- 3 Includes business trips by plane, rail and rental car. As a result of the extensive travel restrictions in place during the pandemic, 2019 is used as a base year for more conclusive comparisons in terms of business travel.\n- 4 Emissions from company cars (Scope 1) are also included on a pro-rata basis under employee commuting and use phase (both Scope 3). A distinction in the systems is currently not possible.\n- 5 2019 is not directly comparable to the other years because an improved data basis was available from 2020 onwards. In some cases, figures have been extrapolated based on data collected at major national and international BMW Group locations. The sites in Farnborough, UK, and Woodcliff Lake, USA, were included in the calculation for the first time in the reporting year 2023.\n- 6 The methodology used to calculate carbon emissions changed in the 2023 reporting year. Previously, the CO2e values were calculated on the basis of a small set of T\u00dcV-validated life cycle assessments performed for European vehicles. Enhancements to the IT system have made it possible to perform a differentiated calculation for all vehicles taking into account different energy mixes and carbon emission factors for different production regions (see \u2197 Glossary). The values in the time series were adapted using this new methodology (values based on prior methodology: 2019: 18,505,921 t CO2e, 2020: 16,234,959 t CO2e, 2021: 18,534,765 t CO2e, 2022: 19,758,702 t CO2e). The values for 2019 through 2021 as well as 2023 shown in the table according to the new methodology were subjected to a reasonable assurance audit. The carbon-reducing measures are taken into account from 2022 onwards. The implementation of measures for 2022 was subjected to a limited assurance audit.\n- 7 Energy consumption values (lower calorific value) in the 'Purchased goods and services' category and the 'Disposal' category are estimated using the methodology specified in footnote (9): 113,179 GWh in the 'Purchased goods and services' category and 908 GWh in the 'Disposal' category.\n- 8 The absolute emissions in the use phase are based on the \u2197 Carbon emissions of the new vehicle fleet worldwide, including upstream emissions (Scope 3 downstream, well-to-wheel). The total value in t CO2 is the result of multiplying the average value with all BMW Group vehicles sold in the reporting period and an assumed average mileage of 200,000 km (as per VDA 900-100).\n- 9 CO2e calculated based on life cycle assessments as per ISO 14040/44 of representative vehicles from the product lines using the 'LCA for Experts' tool provided by Sphera (including climate-impacting gases CO2, CH4, N2O, SF6, NF3).

This includes activities that avoid or reduce greenhouse gas emissions as well as those that remove greenhouse gases from the atmosphere and store them. BVCM is strongly recommended by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) to validated companies in addition to CO2 reduction in their own value chain. The BMW Group is committed to this reduction hierarchy and already actively manages  both  direct  and  indirect  carbon emissions from its plants in line with the 1.5\u00b0C pathway set by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi), which involves implementing significant measures in our value chain, plus additionally engaging in BVCM to  address emissions outside our own value chain. We voluntarily back these initiatives without them counting towards the BMW Group's CO2 reduction targets.\n\nBVCM involves, for example, purchasing certificates on the voluntary  carbon  market.  Criteria  such  as  additionality,  permanence, and certification by independent institutions following international standards (Gold Standard) contribute to the quality of the certificates employed, thereby bolstering the efficacy of our commitment beyond our internal value chain.\n\nIt is also important to us that projects in the Global South create a social benefit in line with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). These include, for example, initiatives that create health benefits such as avoiding open fires in enclosed spaces.\n\n## Bond\n\nA securitised debt instrument in which the issuer certifies its obligation to repay the nominal amount at the end of a fixed term and to pay a fixed or variable rate of interest.\n\n## Business volume in balance sheet terms\n\nThe sum of the balance sheet line items 'Leased products' and 'Receivables from sales financing' (current and non-current), as reported in the balance sheet for the Financial Services segment.\n\nC\n\n## Capitalisation rate\n\nCapitalised development costs as a percentage of research and development expenditure.\n\n## Capital expenditure ratio (excluding capitalised development costs)\n\nInvestments in property, plant and equipment and other intangible assets (excluding capitalised development costs) as a percentage of Group turnover.\n\n## Capital expenditure ratio (excluding right-of-use assets and capitalised development costs)\n\nInvestments in property, plant and equipment (excluding rightof-use assets in accordance with IFRS 16) and other intangible assets (excluding capitalised development costs) as a percentage of Group turnover.\n\n## Carbon dioxide equivalents/CO2e\n\nCO2e is a unit of measurement used to standardise the climate impact of various greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, such as methane or nitrous oxide. This is necessary because the individual gases do not all contribute equally to the greenhouse effect. In addition, the expert committee at the United Nations (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC) has defined 'global warming  potential'  (GWP).  This  is  an  index  used  to  express warming impact compared with CO2 so that all GHGs are aggregated. For example, over a period of 100 years, methane has 28 times the impact of CO 2 , while for nitrous oxide the impact is 265 times higher.\n\nCarbon emissions in the supply chain, including in transport logistics, as well as in upstream fuel production (well-to-tank) are referred to as CO2e. Climate-impacting gases under Scope 1 and 2 are not recognised for reasons of materiality.",

        "page_content": "## Carbon emissions: Scope 1 to Scope 3\n\nThe carbon emissions generated by a company are reported in various categories. The Greenhouse Gas Protocol, a partnership between the World Resources Institute (WRI) and the World Business  Council  for  Sustainable  Development  (WBCSD),  distinguishes  between  Scope  1,  Scope  2  and  Scope  3  emissions, based on their various sources. Whereas direct emissions (Scope 1) are generated within a company through the combustion of fossil fuels, Scope 2 refers to the indirect emissions caused by the consumption of electricity and heat from externally generated sources of energy. Additional indirect (Scope 3) emissions are generated in the upstream and downstream stages of the value chain, for instance in the supply chain (upstream) and in the subsequent use of products and services (downstream).\n\n## Carbon emissions from BMW Group locations per vehicle produced (Scope 1 and 2)\n\nThis key indicator is calculated from the direct and indirect carbon emissions of BMW Group locations relating to the number of vehicles  produced  during  the  year  under  report.  The  carbon emissions result from energy consumption in the BMW Group plants as well as non-manufacturing sites. Electricity from onsite renewable  generation,  Power  Purchase  Agreements  for green electricity and Energy Attribute Certificates (e.g. guarantees of origin) are all taken into account. The conversion is based on emission factors for electricity, district heating and fuels from the German Association of the Automotive Industry (VDA) in the most current valid version and occasionally local emission factors. This key indicator is the basis for measuring the strategic target by 2030 with regard to Scope 1 and 2 emissions. The reporting indicator is t CO2 per vehicle produced.\n\n## CO2e emissions from the supply chain including transport logistics per vehicle produced (Scope 3 upstream)\n\nA methodology tailored specifically for BMW was created to assess the supply chain and logistics emissions in terms of their CO2e equivalents. Due to the absence of supplier-specific CO2e values throughout the entire supply chain, a model incorporating industry averages and, when accessible, supplier-specific data is used. This method draws upon components of ISO 14040/44 and  follows  common  practice  in  preparing  life  cycle  analyses\n\nGlossary and Explanation of Key Figures\n\n(LCA). However, it should be noted that this approach may not be  directly  comparable  with  methods  or  values  employed  by other companies. Due to a lack of data availability, various estimates, assumptions and average values are used to determine the key indicator. The aim is to improve the quality of the model for calculating key metrics in future years. This will be achieved by boosting transparency in supply chains and expanding the detail of the model, all while maintaining consistency in calculations over time.\n\nThe indicator quantifies greenhouse gas emissions (CO2e) produced during production (GHG Protocol Scope 3 upstream category 1), including the transportation of purchased goods and services for production ('inbound'), as well as the global vehicle distribution  of  BMW Group  automobiles  ('outbound')  (collectively GHG Protocol Scope 3 upstream category 4). Contrary to the definition of the scopes of the GHG Protocol, the following are not included: motorcycles, racing vehicles and aftersales products, including their transport logistics, as well as purchased IT cloud services and engineering or development services.\n\n## Baseline calculation of supply chain emissions\n\nThe initial calculation of the supply chain CO2e emissions for a representative selection of vehicles is based on their bill of materials.  This  selection  reflects  the  range  of  vehicle  classes  (from premium compact to luxury) and types of drive (petrol, diesel, PHEV and BEV) produced during the period under review.\n\nFor  the  representative  vehicles,  the  CO2e  emissions  of  all  installed components are calculated on the basis of their material composition and related processing steps. Up to around 60,000 individual entries are evaluated in each case. The CO2e value of the relevant vehicle is calculated by adding these contributions together.\n\nFor the vast majority of vehicle models produced that are not included in the representative vehicles, there is no individual CO2e calculation available on a bill of materials basis. A modular scaling calculation method has been developed to include these in the overall result:\n\nThe bill of materials of the representative vehicles is divided into sections (modules) according to functional criteria, and these are assessed in terms of their total CO2e emissions. Previously unassessed  vehicle  derivatives  can  now  be  custom-built  using these basic components, with different building blocks selected based on the specific technical features of the target vehicles, including engine type, all-wheel drive or body style. Components that do not fit are scaled from existing ones. The scaling techniques are based on empirical data derived from similar analyses as well as on expert evaluations. This encompasses the scaling of detailed bodywork calculations ranging from seda ns to touring models with identical engine specifications.\n\nFor example, in the baseline calculation for 2023, there is a 520i listed as a bill of materials vehicle, but no 520i Touring. To ensure that the latter is accurately represented, the calculated CO 2e emissions for components like the drivetrain, wheels, seats and so on remain unchanged, while the body values are multiplied by a scaling factor when calculating the Touring model.\n\nThe methodology outlined above depends on the established 'LCA for Experts' database (previously known as 'GaBi') from Sphera to ascertain CO2e factors for energy, raw materials and manufacturing processes. In this process, the current datasets are consistently used, starting with the 2023 reporting year. Retrospectively from 2019 until the release of the current datasets at the end of February 2023, data from 2019 are used to calculate CO2e emissions.\n\nThe CO2e emissions of supply chains vary across different regions of the world. For this reason, we allocate the production sites of the vehicles to one of three regions: Europe, Asia or the USA. We then calculate the emissions for the entire vehicle supply chain using the Sphera datasets that are valid for that region. The  particularly  emission-intensive  components,  battery cells and catalytic converter coating are specifically calculated based on  their  actual  production  region,  regardless  of  the  vehicle's manufacturing location.\n\nGiven the significant impact of battery cell production on the vehicles' total CO2e emissions, a detailed calculation model is used",

In addition to the actual assembly sites of the battery cells, the material compositions and related production processes, it also accounts for the unique characteristics of the cell chemistry (anode and cathode) as well as the emissions associated with supplier-specific energy consumption.\n\nThis approach gives each vehicle built during the period under review its specific CO2e value for supply chain emissions. The total  fleet  value  of  CO2e supply chain emissions is  calculated by adding up the CO2e contributions of all vehicles produced in the reporting year.\n\n## Share of the reported value attributable to the supply chain\n\nThe reduction in CO2e emissions compared to the BMW Group's baseline is the result of emission-reducing measures in the supply chain that were contractually agreed with suppliers and verifiably implemented during the reporting year (e.g. electricity from renewable sources, use of recycled materials). Agreements with suppliers of aluminium and precious metals as well as high-voltage storage cells resulted in particularly high reduction contributions.\n\nThe CO2e value for these components and materials before the implementation  of  measures  is  initially  determined  using  the 'LCA for Experts' database on the basis of the type and quantity of material. The emission- reducing measures are then deducted. The calculation of the effect is also carried out using industry average values from 'LCA for Experts' for green electricity and secondary raw materials.\n\nfleet was allocated the supply chain CO2e value of the most similar  vehicle  from  a  small  selection  of  vehicles  that  already  had T\u00dcV-validated  life  cycle  assessments  available.  The  reporting metric is then obtained by adding the transport logistics CO2e emissions, the calculation of which is described in the following section.\n\nAn external service  provider  commissioned  by  BMW conducts the verification of measures at affected suppliers and their subcontractors at the impacted  manufacturing  sites.  A  defined method is used to ensure that the contractually agreed emissions-reducing measures are implemented clearly and without duplication in the reporting year. There are some limitations regarding the clear and non-repetitive allocation of material flows with secondary raw materials. Due to the lack of regulatory mandates, there is currently neither a requirement for the recording and  documentation  of  material  flows  for  secondary  materials across the supply chain (for example on delivery notes), nor is there a government-operated/regulatory registry similar to that of green energy certificates that facilitates the distinct allocation of secondary materials to specific customers without duplication. Therefore, the secondary material quota is confirmed using system  extracts  from  the  relevant  suppliers'  Enterprise  Resource Planning (ERP) systems, along with details and evidence of secondary material procurement through mass balances. Furthermore, written confirmation is obtained from suppliers and n-tier suppliers (via declarations of conformity) to clearly attribute secondary materials to BMW products, preventing any possibility of double-counting with other customers.\n\n## Transport logistics' share of the reporting value\n\nThis indicator takes into account transport logistics emissions in the reporting year. Firstly, inbound and outbound transport flows are documented using IT-enabled billing and movement data to calculate the CO2e emissions in tonnes and the transport volume in tonne-kilometres.\n\nIn inbound logistics (production supply), all transport flows of individual component parts for automobile manufacturing (BMW, MINI and Rolls Royce) are considered. This includes\n\nThe total emission-reducing measures for all components and raw materials in the vehicles produced in the reporting year that are  evaluated  in  this  manner  is  subtracted  from  the  baseline value. This results in the share of supply chain CO 2e emissions in the reporting value of the overall indicator. The methodology for calculating  the  supply  chain  CO2e  emissions  outlined  above marks a key improvement over the previous approach. This improvement allows for the inclusion of agreed-upon emission-reducing measures at the level of individual components and raw materials, among other factors. Until 2022, each vehicle in the\n\nGlossary and Explanation of Key Figures\n\ntransportation from the Tier 1 supplier's shipping location to the receipt  of  goods  at  individual  production  plants  worldwide,  including  partner  plants  and  excluding  contract  manufacturing sites.  In  outbound  logistics  (vehicle  distribution),  all transport flows  of  new  vehicles  transported  from  the  production  sites through compounds and national distributors to individual dealerships worldwide are considered. Exceptions include partial volumes from partner plants.\n\nCO2e emissions are calculated for the gross weight (component weight including packaging and shipping material) as well as the specific vehicle weight and the distance travelled in kilometres. This calculation is based on the respective CO2e emission factor, which varies depending on the technology and mode of transport (road, sea, rail or air). The CO2e emission factors used are derived from contemporary standards such as the GLEC Framework V3.0 and ISO 14083, supplemented by supplier-specific values whenever possible.\n\nIn a second step, an average, derivative-specific inbound CO2e value is assigned to each vehicle produced from the CO2e assessed transport flows, based on plant location and type of drive, and an outbound CO2e value is assigned based on the factorymarket relationship. If inbound and/or outbound CO2e values for individual derivatives are missing in the recorded transport streams (step 1), these are supplemented on the basis of existing derivatives with similar transport routes. Consequently, each manufactured  vehicle  is  allocated  an  inbound  and  outbound CO2e factor based on the production site and intended market. The  share  of  CO2e  emissions  attributed  to  transport  logistics within the 'supply chain and logistics emissions' metric is determined by aggregating the inbound and outbound CO2e emissions of all vehicles manufactured in the reporting year. This approach applies to the CO2e contributions from transport logistics in the base year and in 2022.\n\nCO2e emissions for the years 2019 to 2021 were calculated in previous corporate reports using a variety of emissions factors. Between 2019 and 2022, the recording or assessment of CO2e from transport movements was consistently improved. Among other things, a new IT system was introduced in 2022 to expand",

In line with the range of factors and data sources used for emissions from 2022 onward, a retrospective assessment transport logistics emissions is carried out for the years 2019 to 2021, following the same methodology as from 2022 onward. This involves using factory- or market-specific inbound and outbound CO2e emissions data from 2022 for the vehicles produced in each corresponding year. Vehicle variants from 2019 to 2021 that are no longer produced i n 2022 will be supplemented on the basis of existing derivatives with similar transport routes.\n\n## Carbon emissions of the new vehicle fleet in the EU (Scope 3 downstream, tank-to-wheel)\n\nThe average  carbon  emissions  of  a  manufacturer's  fleet  (use phase) are calculated on the basis of the weighted average of carbon emissions across all vehicles newly registered during the reporting period. This is based on the volume of new registrations by a manufacturer in the EU, including Norway and Iceland, in  the  calendar  year  and  the  individual  vehicle-specific  carbon emissions determined in accordance with the WLTP type test procedure. The BMW Group's fleet carbon emissions figure, as measured internally, includes a legally permitted allowance for eco-innovations with minor significance. The performance indicator for reporting purposes is g CO 2 per kilometre driven.\n\n## Carbon emissions of the new vehicle fleet worldwide including upstream emissions (Scope 3 downstream, wellto-wheel)\n\nThis indicator documents the progress made by the BMW Group in its strategic objective of reducing carbon emissions during the use phase including upstream emissions (drivetrain energy supply) by an average rate of at least 50% per kilometre driven by 2030 (base year 2019). For the purpose of this calculation, volume-weighted average fleet carbon emissions are calculated for the core markets EU (27 EU countries including Norway and Iceland plus UK) (driving cycle: Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Procedure; basis: vehicle registrations), USA (driving cycle:  United  States  Combined; basis: production volume) and China (driving cycle: Worldwide Harmonized Test Cycle, subject to China-specific framework conditions for testing; basis: import or local production volumes) before deduction of ly\n\nof permitted credit factors (e.g. supercredits and eco-innovations) and standardised according to the WLTP (European) driving cycle. These core markets account for more than 80% of the BMW Group's sales. The calculated figures are increased by 10% to account for possible discrepancies between cycle values and real emissions, as required by the Science Based Targets initiative. This indicator also includes the upstream emissions of the energy sources (fossil fuels and electricity used for charging), in line with the well-to-wheel approach. This covers the entire impact chain behind vehicle motion, i.e. from the generation and supply of power to its conversion into drivetrain energy. This approach also includes the environmental impacts associated with the production of fuel and electricity. For example, to calculate the volume of emissions resulting from upstream electricity (drivetrain energy  supply),  the  BMW  Group  uses  the  energy  report  published by the International Energy Agency (IEA; reference basis: previous year) as a basis in order to assess the emissions associated  with  the  electricity  mix  in  its  core  markets.  The  performance indicator for reporting  purposes  is  g  CO 2 per  kilometre driven.\n\n## Cash flow at risk\n\nSimilar to 'value at risk' (see definition below).\n\n## Cash flow hedges\n\nHedges against exposures to the variability in forecasted cash flows, particularly in connection with exchange rate fluctuations.\n\n## Commercial paper\n\nDeep-discounted bonds with a term of less than one year.\n\n## Consolidation\n\nGlossary and Explanation of Key Figures\n\ncredit default insurance agreements, the party receiving the premiums gives a commitment to compensate the bond creditor in the event of default.\n\n## D\n\n## Deliveries\n\nA new or used vehicle will be recorded as a delivery once handed over to the end user.

In the case of used vehicles, end users may include dealerships and other third parties when they purchase a vehicle at auction or directly from the BMW Group. Vehicles designated for the end user which suffer a total loss in transit are also recorded as deliveries. Deliveries may be made by BMW AG, one of its international subsidiaries, a BMW Group retail outlet, or independent dealerships. The vast majority of deliveries - and hence the reporting to BMW Group of deliveries are made by independent dealerships. In the US and Canada, the period start and end dates for the reporting of deliveries deviate immaterially from the beginning and, respectively, end of calendar years or calendar quarters and instead follow industrystandard reporting calendars. In the German-language version of the BMW Group Report, the terms 'Auslieferungen' (deliveries) and 'Absatz' (sales) are used interchangeably.\n\n## E\n\n## Earnings per share (EPS)\n\nThe process of consolidating  separate financial statements of Group entities into Group Financial Statements, depicting the financial  position,  net  assets  and  results  of  operations  of  the Group as a single economic entity.\n\n## Credit default swap (CDS)\n\nlegal Financial swap agreements, under which creditors of securities (usually bonds) pay premiums to the seller of the CDS to hedge against the risk that the issuer of the bond will default.

This approach also includes the environmental impacts associated with the production of fuel and electricity. For example, the BMW  Group uses the current energy report from the International Energy Agency (IEA; reference basis: previous year) as the basis for calculating emissions from electrified vehicles (provision of electrical energy). As a result, this approach can be divided into the following two components:\n\nThe well-to-tank method takes into account the carbon emissions from the supply chain as well as the upstream fuel supply from the oil well or the energy generation source. As such, this approach considers the impact chain that arises until the energy is supplied to the vehicle, but does not include the vehicle itself.\n\nBy contrast, the tank -to-wheel method takes into account the impact chain of energy received (fuel, electricity) until it is converted into kinetic energy by the vehicle. As such, this approach considers the impact chain that arises during the use of the vehicle.\n\n## Working hours/working times\n\nContractually stipulated weekly hours of work.\n\n<!-- image -->",
