Leif brought together a strong Board, with an impressive and diverse mix of skills and experience, to oversee our ambitious pursuit of innovation and success.\n\nLeif and I share the view that a board has three core roles: maintaining good governance, oversight of strategy and development of people. As your new Chair, I look forward to focusing on these priorities and, building on my own experience in other organisations, working with the Board to unlock the full potential of what AstraZeneca has to offer.\n\n## A clear strategy and ambitious goals\n\nAstraZeneca's achievements and returns to shareholders are built on the successful delivery of our Growth Through Innovation strategy and our strategic priorities. We have ambitious plans for the future and are relentless in our focus to push the boundaries of science to deliver life-changing medicines. By living our Values and realising our strategic goals, we aim to transform patient outcomes, deliver industry-leading revenue growth, and ensure we remain a great place to work. Between 2023 and 2030, we aim to launch at least 15 new medicines and become carbon negative, thereby making an even bigger difference for people, society and the planet.\n\n'  Our differentiated and growing portfolio of approved medicines, global reach and rich R&D pipeline give us confidence that we will continue to grow faster than the industry over the near and medium term'\n\n## Performance and outlook\n\nAs AstraZeneca celebrates its 25th anniversary, I was pleased we were able to report another year of strong financial development and scientific progress, with double-digit earnings growth, and investment in exciting areas of science that lay the foundations for long-term success.\n\nReflecting this financial performance, the Board intends to declare a second interim dividend of $1.97 per share, making a total dividend declared for the full year of $2.90.\n\nLooking ahead, we expect another year of strong growth in 2024, driven by continued adoption of our medicines across geographies. Our differentiated and growing portfolio of approved medicines, global reach and rich R&D pipeline give us confidence that we will continue to grow faster than the industry over the near and medium term.\n\n## A purpose-driven organisation\n\nIn my time as a Director, I have experienced at first hand the commitment of AstraZeneca people to delivering our Purpose. And in my recent experience as Chair, whether at our Speke site in the UK or Gaithersburg in the US, our Gothenburg site in Sweden or our Tokyo office in Japan, I have been extremely impressed by the enthusiasm for everything they do. I would like to extend my personal thanks to everyone in AstraZeneca for all they have achieved in 2023, as well as to Pascal, the Senior Executive Team and my fellow Directors.\n\n## $2.90\n\nFull-year dividend of $2.90 per share (2022: $2.90)\n\n## Engaging stakeholders and shareholders\n\nThe role AstraZeneca has to play in addressing public health challenges and promoting innovation and sustainable access to treatments resonates strongly with governments and other stakeholders I have met during the year.\n\nThrough the Partnership for Health System Sustainability and Resilience (PHSSR), I engaged policymakers, academics and health leaders across countries to advance policies strengthening the capacity of health systems to absorb the impact of future crises, while effectively responding to today's growing burden of diseases. AstraZeneca is incredibly proud to be a founding member of the PHSSR, a public-private partnership that is accelerating the transformation of health systems around the world. I also valued the opportunity to deepen AstraZeneca's collaborations with patient advocacy groups, governments and the private sector to improve equitable health outcomes for all.\n\nMost recently I was proud to lead the AstraZeneca delegation at the World Economic Forum where we explored how to deepen our collaboration with key stakeholders to ensure healthcare is viewed as a strategic asset everywhere in the world.\n\nFinally, I have enjoyed meeting shareholders and understanding what you would like to see from AstraZeneca. I look forward to meeting more of you this year and to driving continued impact for patients.\n\nMichel Demar\u00e9 Chair\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Chief Executive Officer's Review\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2023 was a year in which we continued to grow the business and deliver for patients. At the same time, we are investing for the future benefit of people, society and the planet.\n\n' Our vision for health is not a short-term one. While maintaining our focus on discovering new small and large molecules, we are also increasing investment behind new modalities\u2026'\n\n2023 was a year of strong growth and execution of our long-term growth strategy as Total Revenue increased by 3% (6% at CER) to $45.8 billion. Excluding COVID-19 medicines, Total Revenue increased by 13% (15% at CER) to $45.5 billion.\n\n## Continued growth in our therapy areas\n\nOur ability to grow the business builds on our broad-based, diverse sources of revenue across our therapy areas and regions.\n\nIn our therapy areas, Total Revenue in 2023 for Oncology increased by 19% (21% at CER); Cardiovascular, Renal & Metabolism by 15% (18% at CER); and Respiratory & Immunology by 7% (10% at CER). Vaccines & Immune Therapies Total Revenue fell by 72% (71% at CER) as demand for COVID-19 medicines fell away, while Rare Disease rose by 10% (12% at CER).\n\nIn our regions, Total Revenue in the US was up 6% in 2023, in Europe it grew by 10% (8% at CER) and by 2% (9% at CER) in Emerging Markets. Total Revenue fell by 14% (8% at CER) in Established Rest of World. Excluding COVID-19 medicines, Total Revenue grew in all regions.\n\nOur financial performance was matched by our operational performance, with 282 successful on-time launches during the year, overall supply performance of more than 99% and zero critical observations reported from 49 external inspections. This represents an outstanding performance that ensures a continuous supply of high-quality medicines to patients.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n56\n\nRegulatory events - submissions or approvals in major markets\n\n## Innovating in science\n\nAstraZeneca has one of the leading development pipelines in the sector and its strength in 2023 was evidenced by first approvals for three new medicines - the first year in our eight-year goal of launching at least 15 new molecular entities (NMEs) between 2023 and 2030.\n\nAirsupra was approved for the first time in January 2023 for use as an as-needed treatment to reduce risk of asthma exacerbations. In November, Truqap in combination with Faslodex was approved for certain patients with advanced HR-positive breast cancer. And, right at the end of 2023, AstraZeneca and Ionis' Wainua was approved for the treatment of the polyneuropathy of hereditary transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis in adults. It is the only approved treatment that can be self-administered with an auto-injector.\n\nThe good news continued in January 2024 with first approval of Voydeya , a first-in-class oral, Factor D inhibitor developed as an add-on to proven standard of care Ultomiris or Soliris to address the needs of a small subset of patients with paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria.\n\nThe broad strength of our pipeline was exemplified by the fact that we achieved 56 regulatory events during the year, either submissions or approvals for our medicines in major markets. Additionally, we recorded 30 pipeline progression events, either NME Phase II starts or Phase III investment decisions. Of course, pushing boundaries sometimes means setbacks and, while we had some clinical trials during the year that did not meet their primary objectives, we are committed to improving health outcomes and learn from all our trials. Overall, 2023 was predominantly a year of scientific success and our pipeline progress indicates our ability to deliver longer-term sustainable growth.",

        "page_content": "Importantly, the science in each of our therapy areas is making a real difference to the lives of people around the world. For example, in Oncology, Enhertu , the antibody drug conjugate we are developing with Daiichi Sankyo, is approved around the world for the treatment of HER2-mutated breast, lung and gastric cancers. In addition, in 2023, it received not one, but two more US Breakthrough Therapy Designations for multiple types of HER2-expressing tumours and HER2-positive colorectal cancer. Additionally, in January 2024, it was granted Priority Review in the US for patients with a range of metastatic HER2-positive solid tumours.\n\nThese designations demonstrate the impact regulatory authorities believe Enhertu can have. Dato-DXd is also being developed with Daiichi Sankyo, and pivotal trial data announced during the year underlined our confidence in its potential to replace conventional chemotherapy for many patients with advanced lung and breast cancers.\n\nIn BioPharmaceuticals, data from the Forxiga DELIVER trial was critical in informing a Class 1a recommendation in updated European Society of Cardiology Heart Failure guidelines. We have further strengthened our pipeline with CinCor's candidate drug, baxdrostat for blood pressure lowering, with Quell to develop, manufacture and commercialise engineered T-regulatory cell therapies for autoimmunedriven diseases, and with Eccogene's novel agent, AZD5004 for the treatment of obesity and broader cardiometabolic conditions.\n\nOur medicines are now helping patients with rare diseases in 70 markets - 18 more than 2021. Treatments include Ultomiris for multiple indications, including neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD), a progressive autoimmune disease that impacts the central nervous system. With no relapses observed in the pivotal CHAMPION-NMOSD trial, Ultomiris marks a significant advance for these patients. Regulatory reviews are ongoing, including in the US, and it is already approved in the EU and Japan.\n\n## People, society and the planet\n\nAll AstraZeneca's achievements are down to the skills and capabilities of its people, and I am delighted to see that we have a highly engaged workforce, with 86% believing that we are a great place to work. I am also pleased with the progress we are making in creating an inclusive multinational and multicultural environment where everyone belongs, and using this diversity as a competitive advantage. I am particularly proud that 50% of our senior roles are filled by women.\n\nLooking beyond AstraZeneca, 2023 was the year in which the world recognised that the climate crisis is a health crisis. This was no more apparent than at COP28 in Dubai where,\n\nfor the first time, health was on the agenda and AstraZeneca was able to play a leading role in a dedicated Health Day that discussed the transition to low-carbon, climate-resilient health systems.\n\nAstraZeneca is working to decarbonise healthcare and is doing so in collaboration with peers, stakeholders and suppliers. Since 2015, there has been a 68% reduction in our Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and, during 2023, we concluded agreements in the UK and in the US to use renewable natural gas, or biomethane, to supply clean heat to our sites. In addition, through our power purchase agreement in Sweden, we are expanding the country's wind energy capacity. Also in 2023, we strengthened our investment in nature-based solutions by expanding our AZ Forest programme to include planting and maintaining 200 million trees across six continents by 2030. Overall, through our Ambition Zero Carbon strategy we are on track to halve our entire value chain Scope 1, 2 and 3 footprint by 2030 and, through AZ Forest, we aim to become carbon negative for all residual GHG emissions from 2030 onwards, removing more from the atmosphere than we emit.\n\nOf course, our greatest contribution to human health is through our medicines and securing a future where people have access to affordable, sustainable healthcare. Through our access to healthcare programmes, we have reached more than 66 million people, while our Partnership for Health System Sustainability and Resilience is fostering joint learning and acting as a catalyst to strengthen health systems in more than 30 countries. We are not resting there and are advancing a health equity strategy that will build on our existing access programmes to enable more equitable global health outcomes.\n\n## Investing in future health\n\nOur vision for health is not a short-term one. While maintaining our focus on discovering new small and large molecules, we are also increasing investment behind new modalities that we believe have the potential to revolutionise outcomes for patients. We are exploring modalities such as cell, gene and RNA therapies, epigenetics and oligonucleotides to unlock entirely new treatment approaches and are excited by their curative potential.\n\nOur own efforts in these new modalities are supplemented by external expertise. In 2023, we announced the proposed acquisition of biotechnology company, Gracell, to further our cell therapy ambitions across oncology and autoimmune diseases, and an agreement with Cellectis, a clinical-stage biotechnology company, to accelerate cell therapy as well as genomic medicine. We also acquired a portfolio of preclinical rare disease gene therapies and our proposed acquisition of\n\nIcosavax, focused on developing differentiated, high-potential vaccines using an innovative, protein virus-like particle platform, will build on our expertise in respiratory syncytial virus.\n\nWe operate across the whole life-cycle of a medicine and, in November, we launched Evinova, a health-tech business designing and leveraging digital tools to accelerate innovation across the life sciences sector, the delivery of clinical trials as well as better health outcomes.\n\nAs shown throughout this Report, our efforts to push the boundaries of science are helped by artificial intelligence and new digital technologies that allow us to discover and deliver new treatments faster than ever before and drive a step-change in the diagnosis, monitoring and treatment of patients.\n\n## Colleagues\n\nIn closing, I want to thank all the AstraZeneca team for the part they have played in an exceptional year and for what we have been able to achieve for people, society and the planet.\n\nThanks also go to my colleagues on the Senior Executive Team where, during the year, we welcomed Sharon Barr, who joined as Executive Vice President, BioPharmaceuticals R&D to replace Mene Pangalos, who retires in 2024. Sharon brings outstanding experience from Alexion and a track record of driving productivity, innovation and delivery of medicines. I want to thank Mene for his remarkable contribution to AstraZeneca and all he has done to transform how we approach R&D. In particular, I would like to pay tribute to the role he played in AstraZeneca's response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The quality of the medicines he has brought to patients, and the pipeline and capabilities he has built, will be his legacy for many years to come.\n\nIn the year when we said farewell to Leif Johansson as Chair, I would like to close by extending my thanks to his successor, Michel Demar\u00e9, who continues to ensure we pursue our Purpose of pushing the boundaries of science to deliver life-changing medicines.\n\nPascal Soriot Chief Executive Officer\n\n<!-- image -->",

Also, urgent, short-term risks are creating economic and geopolitical changes that may hasten other global threats. Current crises that divert attention and resources from medium- to longer-term risks may increase pressures on natural and human ecosystems. Some of these risks are close to a point of no return, but opportunities exist to shape a more secure future.\n\nGeopolitical tensions, such as conflict in the Middle East, increase pressure on companies' supply and distribution networks and may also have ripple effects over the medium term, contributing to a potential 'polycrisis' of interrelated environmental, geopolitical and socioeconomic risks relating to natural resources supply and demand. Geopolitical tensions and economic pressures have already limited, and in some cases reversed, progress on climate change mitigation, at least over the short term.\n\n(Source: World Economic Forum (WEF): The Global Risk Report 2023 18th edition)\n\n## 2 . 9 %\n\nGlobal GDP growth was forecast to slow from 3.5% in 2022 to 3.0% in 2023 and 2.9% in 2024. (Source: International Monetary Fund (IMF) World Economic Outlook, October 2023)\n\nThese growth projections remain below the historical (2000-2019) average of 3.8%. For advanced economies, the expected slowdown is from 2.6% in 2022 to 1.5% in 2023 and 1.4% in 2024, with stronger than expected US momentum but weaker than expected growth in the euro area. Emerging market and developing economies are projected to have modestly declining growth, from 4.1% in 2022 to 4.0% in both 2023 and 2024. Forecasts for global growth over the medium term, at 3.1%, are at their lowest in decades, and prospects for countries to catch up to higher living standards are weak. The likelihood of a hard economic landing has receded, but the balance of risks to global growth remains tilted to the downside.\n\nGlobal inflation was forecast to decline steadily, from 8.7% in 2022 to 6.9% in 2023 and 5.8% in 2024 but is not expected to return to target until 2025 in most countries.\n\n(Source: IMF World Economic Outlook, October 2023)\n\n## Economic\n\nActivity falls short of pre-pandemic path\n\n## Societal\n\nIncreasing pace of population ageing\n\nEvery country in the world is experiencing growth in the number and proportion of older people.\n\n## 1 in 6\n\nBy 2030, 1 in 6 people in the world will be aged 60 or over. (Source: World Health Organization (WHO))\n\nBy 2050, the world's population of people aged 60 and older will double, to 2.1 billion. The number of people aged above 80 is expected to triple between 2020 and 2050, to 426 million. This places strains on healthcare systems and reduces the pool of working age people.\n\nLow- and middle-income countries (LMICs) are now seeing the greatest population changes. By 2050, two thirds of the world's over 60s will live in LMICs, which are also disproportionately affected by noncommunicable diseases (NCDs). NCDs kill 41 million people each year, more than three quarters of these in LMICs.\n\nNCDs represented seven of the 10 leading causes of death in 2019 or 74% of deaths globally. Cardiovascular (CV) diseases account for 17.9 million deaths annually, followed by cancers (9.3 million), chronic respiratory diseases (4.1 million) and diabetes (2.0 million).\n\n(Source: WHO)",

For example, data science and AI can increase productivity in research, development and manufacturing, helping new medicines to reach patients more quickly. For medical professionals, AI can improve decision making, reduce errors and costs, personalise care plans and enhance patient monitoring. AI may also enhance the quality and accessibility of healthcare services, especially in remote and underserved areas.\n\nHowever, a survey of chief risk officers by the WEF identified concerns about the potential harms caused by AI technologies deliberately or inadvertently. More than 90% of respondents wished to see an accelerated pace of regulation around the development of these technologies to ensure the benefits can be realised safely.\n\n(Source: WEF: Chief Risk Officers Outlook July 2023)\n\n## Environmental\n\nClimate change accelerating\n\nClimate change and ecosystem degradation impact human health and undermine the capacity of health systems.\n\n## 100,000\n\n2023 brought the highest global temperatures in more than 100,000 years.\n\n(Source: 2023 report of the Lancet Countdown on health and climate change)\n\nClimate change is a threat to human wellbeing and planetary health.

But 22% still distrust the industry.\n\n(Source: Ipsos Global Trustworthiness Monitor: Stability in an unstable world)\n\nWhile demographic and other changes are driving an increased demand for healthcare, continued advances in science and digital technologies are driving healthcare innovation and improvements. But risks remain. In addition to the downward pricing pressure, the sector faces regulatory challenges, loss of exclusivity and genericisation, and increasing expectations from various stakeholders.\n\nTo succeed, pharmaceutical companies must be able to take advantage of AI and emerging technologies. They also need to respond to the demands and expectations, and earn the trust of patients and caregivers, healthcare professionals and health authorities, payers, policymakers and others. They need to protect themselves against harmful misinformation and disinformation, which will require collaboration between businesses, policymakers and other stakeholders to tackle at scale.",

Scienti/fic platforms to attack cancer from multiple angles, including targeting cancer cells directly and activating the immune system. We use monotherapy and combination approaches to drive deeper, more durable, responses:\n- a. Tumour drivers and resistance - targeting genetic mutations and resistance mechanisms that enable cancer cells to survive and proliferate.\n- b. DNA damage response - targeting the DNA repair process to block cancer cells reproducing.\n- c. Antibody Drug Conjugates (ADCs) - highly potent cancer-killing agents delivered directly to cancer cells via a linker attached to a targeted antibody.\n- d. Epigenetics - targeting changes to genome expression caused by cancer.\n\n- e. Immuno-oncology - activating the body's own immune system to help /fight cancer.\n- f.  Cell therapies - harnessing living cells to target cancer.\n- g. Immune engagers - redirecting the immune system's T-cells to the tumour and amplifying that patient's own anti-cancer immune response.\n- 2. Treating cancer earlier where the greatest opportunity for cure exists and building expertise and leadership in key tumour types.\n- 3. Collaborating to harness transformational technologies, including computational pathology, circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) testing, digital health and data science/AI.\n- 4. Leveraging our global footprint - to make cancer therapies available to every eligible and appropriate patient.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFull details are given in the Development Pipeline and Patent Expiries of Key Marketed Products Supplements on our website, www.astrazeneca.com/ annualreport2023.\n\n## Key marketed products\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Product                             | Disease                                                         | Total Revenue                    | Commentary                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Tagrisso (osimertinib)              | Lung cancer                                                     | $5,799m,  up 7%  (9% at CER)     | Approved in 101 countries for the adjuvant treatment of patients with early-stage EGFRm  NSCLC and in 99 countries for both the 1st- and 2nd-line treatment of advanced EGFRm  NSCLC.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n| Imfinzi 2 (durvalumab)              | Lung cancer Bladder cancer Liver cancer                         | $4,237m,  up 52%  (55% at CER)   | Approved in 87 countries in the curative-intent setting of unresectable, Stage III NSCLC after  chemoradiotherapy (CRT) and in extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (SCLC) in 85 countries.

Our comprehensive portfolio includes leading medicines Tagrisso , Imfinzi , Imjudo , Enhertu and Orpathys , along with a promising pipeline of potential new medicines and combinations across diverse mechanisms of action. AstraZeneca lung cancer data were featured in four plenary presentations at major medical congresses this year.\n\n- > Positive results from the FLAURA2 Phase III trial showed Tagrisso with the addition of chemotherapy demonstrated a statistically signi/ficant and clinically meaningful improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) versus Tagrisso monotherapy in advanced epidermal growth factor receptor mutated (EGFRm) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and was ultimately granted Priority Review in the US based on these results. Furthermore, positive overall survival results from the ADAURA Phase III trial showed Tagrisso achieved an unprecedented overall survival bene/fit for adjuvant early-stage EGFRm NSCLC, becoming the /first Phase III trial to demonstrate survival bene/fit in this setting.\n- > We reported positive results from the TROPION-Lung01 Phase III trial which showed that Dato-DXd demonstrated a statistically signi/ficant PFS bene/fit versus docetaxel in patients with previously treated locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC, and a clinically meaningful bene/fit in those with non-squamous tumours. We also reported results from TROPION-Lung02 and TROPION-Lung04 Phase Ib trials which showed Dato-DXd in combination with immunotherapy (pembrolizumab or Imfinzi , respectively), with or without chemotherapy, demonstrated encouraging responses and no new safety signals in the 1st-line advanced NSCLC setting. Dato-DXd is jointly developed and commercialised with Daiichi Sankyo.\n\n## Over 30m\n\nThe global burden of cancer is expected to grow, with over 30 million newly diagnosed patients estimated by 2040. Two thirds of those patients are expected to be in low-to-middle income countries.\n\n- > Positive Phase III results from the AEGEAN Phase III trial showed Imfinzi signi/ficantly improved event-free survival in patients with NSCLC, increasing the time patients lived without recurrence or progression before and after surgery, and regulatory submission was accepted in the US based on these results. Additionally, Imfinzi in combination with Imjudo was approved in the EU for patients with metastatic NSCLC based on the POSEIDON Phase III trial. We also reported that the PACIFIC-2 Phase III trial for Imfinzi concurrently administered with CRT did not achieve statistical signi/ficance for PFS versus CRT alone in unresectable, Stage III NSCLC.\n- > Enhertu became the /first human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-directed therapy approved in the EU for patients with HER2-mutant advanced NSCLC based on results from the DESTINY-Lung02 trial. Enhertu is jointly developed and commercialised with Daiichi Sankyo.\n- > Our novel immuno-oncology bispeci/fic development programme continued to advance with the initiation of the eVOLVELung02 Phase III trial investigating volrustomig, which simultaneously targets PD-1 and CTLA-4, as a 1st-line treatment in combination with chemotherapy in metastatic NSCLC.\n\n## Breast cancer\n\nWe are aiming to rede/fine clinical practice and transform outcomes across all subtypes and stages of breast cancer. Ultimately, it is our ambition to contribute to eliminating breast cancer as a cause of death. Our comprehensive portfolio of approved medicines, including Truqap , Enhertu , Lynparza , Faslodex and Zoladex , and promising breast cancer medicines in development, including Imfinzi , Dato-DXd and camizestrant, leverage different mechanisms of action to address the biologically diverse breast cancer tumour environment.\n\n- > Positive results from the TROPIONBreast01 Phase III trial showed that Dato-DXd provided a statistically signi/ficant and clinically meaningful PFS bene/fit versus investigator's choice chemotherapy for patients with inoperable or metastatic HR-positive, HER2-low or negative metastatic breast cancer previously treated with endocrine-based therapy and at least one systemic therapy. Updated results from the BEGONIA Phase Ib/II trial showed that Dato-DXd in combination with Imfinzi demonstrated robust and durable tumour responses in the 1st-line treatment of patients with metastatic triple-negative breast cancer.\n\n- > Our newest Oncology medicine, Truqap , was approved in the US in combination with Faslodex as the /first AKT-inhibitor for patients with HR-positive, HER2-negative locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer with certain gene alterations following disease progression or recurrence, based on the CAPItello-291 Phase III trial. The US regulatory submission was granted Priority Review in June 2023.\n- > Enhertu was approved in the EU and China as the /first HER2-directed therapy for patients with HER2-low metastatic breast cancer based on the DESTINY-Breast04 Phase III trial.\n- > Two Phase III trials (CAMBRIA-1 and CAMBRIA-2) were initiated to investigate camizestrant, our potential next-generation selective estrogen receptor (ER) degrader, as an adjuvant therapy for patients with ER-positive, HER2-negative early breast cancer.\n\n## Genitourinary/Gynaecological cancers\n\nIn genitourinary cancers, we aim to transform treatment paradigms through the delivery of innovative treatments to help many more patients than today, including establishing Lynparza plus abiraterone and prednisone as a standard of care (SoC) in 1st-line metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). In gynaecological (GYN) cancers, we will continue to rede/fine survival expectations, introducing new medicines beyond ovarian cancer across multiple GYN tumours, expanding into endometrial with Imfinzi and into cervical cancer.\n\n- > Positive results from the DUO-O Phase III trial showed treatment with a combination of Lynparza , Imfinzi , chemotherapy and bevacizumab demonstrated a statistically signi/ficant improvement in PFS versus chemotherapy plus bevacizumab in patients with advanced ovarian cancer without tumour breast cancer gene (BRCA) mutations. Additionally, results from the DUO-E Phase III trial showed that Imfinzi plus chemotherapy in combination with Lynparza reduced the risk of disease progression or death versus chemotherapy in advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer, becoming the /first global Phase III trial of immunotherapy plus poly (ADPribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibition to demonstrate clinical bene/fit in this setting.\n- > Lynparza plus abiraterone and prednisone was approved in the US and Japan for the treatment of BRCA-mutated (BRCAm) metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, based on the Phase III PROpel trial.\n- > Our next wave of potential new medicines includes saruparib, a PARP1 selective agent being investigated in combination with novel hormonal agents in metastatic castrate-sensitive prostate cancer (EvoPAR-Prostate01 Phase III trial), and volrustomig, a potential new treatment being tested in advanced cervical cancer (eVOLVE-Cervical Phase III trial).",

This is the /first global Phase III trial to show improved clinical outcome for systemic therapy in combination with TACE in this setting, and the trial continues to follow the secondary endpoint of overall survival.\n- > Positive results from the MATTERHORN Phase III trial showed treatment with Imfinzi , in combination with standard of care (SoC) FLOT neoadjuvant chemotherapy, signi/ficantly improved pathologic complete response versus neoadjuvant chemotherapy in gastric and gastroesophageal junction cancers.\n- > Imfinzi was approved in China for the 1st-line treatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic BTC in combination with chemotherapy, based on the TOPAZ-1 Phase III trial, and in the EU in combination with Imjudo for the treatment of patients with advanced or uHCC, based on the Phase III HIMALAYA trial.\n\n- > We accelerated our ADC development programme, entering an exclusive global licence agreement with KYM Biosciences to develop AZD0901, a potentially /first-inclass ADC targeting Claudin 18.2, with interim results showing promising early clinical ef/ficacy.\n- > For our novel bispeci/fic programme we initiated the ARTEMIDE-Biliary01 Phase III trial, assessing our novel anti-PD-1/ anti-TIGIT bispeci/fic antibody rilvegostomig, in combination with chemotherapy, in patients with biliary tract cancer.\n\n## Blood cancers\n\nIn haematology, we are using our six scienti/fic platforms to develop and test novel investigational agents designed to target underlying drivers. Calquence , our nextgeneration BTK inhibitor, has treated 50,000 patients globally with approvals in 89 countries across multiple haematological diseases.\n\n- > Calquence was approved for the /first time in China for the treatment of CLL or SLL, based on the ASCEND global Phase III trial and a Phase I/II trial in China.\n- > The tablet formulation of Calquence was approved in the EU for CLL and is designed to be co-administered with gastric acid-reducing agents, allowing greater patient and physician choice.\n- > Promising interim results from a Phase I trial of AZD0486, a CD19/CD3 next-generation T-cell engager, demonstrated a high complete response rate in patients with relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma with a manageable safety pro/file.\n\n- > We initiated an exclusive global licence with LaNova Medicines for AZD0305 (LM305), a GPRC5D ADC, with the aim to accelerate our entry into multiple myeloma.\n\n## Pan-tumour\n\nTogether with Daiichi Sankyo, we are exploring the potential role of HER2-directed therapies in treating multiple solid tumour types. Positive results from the DESTINYPanTumour02 Phase II trial showed Enhertu demonstrated clinically meaningful survival across multiple HER2-expressing advanced solid tumours including either biliary tract, bladder, cervical, endometrial, ovarian or pancreatic cancers or other tumours. In January 2024, Enhertu was granted Priority Review in the US for patients with a range of metastatic HER2-positive solid tumours.",

strategy in action\n\nOur CVRM strategy is focused on four key areas: CV, renal, HF, and metabolic diseases.\n\n## Cardiovascular (CV)\n\nCV disease is the leading cause of death and is responsible for approximately one third of all deaths globally. Our ambition is to reduce CV risk by improving hypertension control and reducing dyslipidaemia.\n\n- > We continue to make a difference for patients with Brilinta , now approved in more than 124 countries for atherosclerosis and in 82 countries for high-risk patients with history of heart attack.\n- > Andexxa is designed to bind to FXa inhibitors and rapidly reverse their anticoagulant effect in patients with major bleeds. In June, the Andexxa Phase IV (Annexa-I) trial stopped early after achieving pre-speci/fied ef/ficacy criteria versus usual care. The results of the trial have been presented at the World Stroke Congress and submitted for publication.\n\n- > In February 2023, AstraZeneca completed the acquisition of CinCor, focused on developing baxdrostat, an investigational once-daily medication, for the treatment of hard-to-treat hypertension.\n- > There is also a need for new approaches to stop progression of atherosclerosis caused by dyslipidaemia. AZD0780 is an oral inhibitor (oPCSK9) being developed for greater ease of use and enhanced convenience, aiming to drive reduction in LDL-C levels not achievable by statins alone.\n\n## Renal\n\nNearly 850 million people worldwide, or more than one in 10 people, are affected by kidney disease and more than 90% of people with CKD remain undiagnosed. Our ambition in CKD is to eliminate progression to kidney failure.\n\n- > Forxiga is now approved in over 120 markets for the treatment of CKD.\n- > In November, results from the real-world ZORA observational multicountry study showed that treating HK with the potassium",

ZORA also showed patients were 2.5 times more likely to stay on RAASi therapy when treated with Lokelma versus those not prescribed a potassium binder.\n\n- > At the American Society of Nephrology (ASN) 2023, the Phase IIb data for zibotentan/dapagli/flozin was presented showing signi/ficant albuminuria reduction versus dapagli/flozin alone in patients with CKD and proteinuria, supporting progress to Ph3 for High Proteinuria CKD.\n- > Additional real-world evidence from the REVEAL-CKD, OPTIMISE-CKD and IMPACT-CKD studies highlighted the urgent need to act on the growing global burden and underdiagnosis of CKD.\n- > In September 2023, the Global Patient Alliance for Kidney Health, a community-led alliance of 17 patient advocacy organisations, was launched with /financial sponsorship from AstraZeneca.\n- > We have an innovative early pipeline in renal, with AZD2373 under investigation as a precision medicine with the aim of preventing progression to kidney failure for people genetically at risk of kidney disease due to two apolipoprotein L1 (APOL1) alleles.\n\n## Heart failure (HF)\n\nHF affects nearly 64 million people globally and is closely linked to other CVRM conditions. Our ambition is to eliminate HF as /first cause of hospitalisation and cure HF with reduced ejection fraction.\n\n- > The DELIVER Phase III trial showed that Forxiga reduced the risk of CV death or worsening HF across all left ventricular ejection fractions (LVEF). Forxiga is now approved for HF across all LVEF in 91 markets including the EU, US, China and Japan. In August 2023, Forxiga received a 1st-line recommendation in the 2023 European Society of Cardiology Treatment Guidelines for HF across the LVEF spectrum.\n- > Transthyretin-mediated amyloid cardiomyopathy (ATTR-CM) and polyneuropathy (ATTRv-PN) are progressive systemic diseases leading to poor quality of life and eventually death. In September 2023, published results from the NEUROTTRansform Phase III trial for eplontersen, a potential best-in-class, ligand-conjugated antisense oligonucleotide designed to treat all types of ATTR, demonstrated sustained bene/fit in the treatment of ATTRv-PN through 85 weeks. Together with our partner Ionis Pharmaceuticals, we received the /first regulatory approval for Wainua (eplontersen) for the treatment of ATTRv-PN in the US in December 2023 with the EU and others expected to follow in 2024.\n- > Wainua is also currently being evaluated in the Phase III CARDIO-TTRansform trial for ATTR-CM.\n- > Our early pipeline is aimed at targeting key mechanisms in HF, including widespread in/flammation, /fibrosis, hypertrophy and microvascular dysfunction, as a major priority. Mitiperstat (AZD4831) is an investigational, oral myeloperoxidase (MPO) inhibitor intended to be complementary to SoC for patients diagnosed with HF with preserved ejection fraction. By targeting this key disease driver, the aim is to reduce in/flammation and /fibrosis, thereby increasing survival and reducing hospitalisation.\n\n## Metabolism\n\nMore than 650 million adults are living with obesity and the prevalence of diabetes is expected to rise to 783 million by 2045. Our ambition is to eliminate metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis, (MASH, previously NASH) /fibrosis as a leading cause of liver failure. We also remain committed to treat beyond haemoglobin A1C in T2D.\n\n- > Forxiga continues to help patients with T2D worldwide with approvals in more than 100 countries. In June 2023, Xigduo XR (dapagli/flozin and metformin hydrochloride extended-release) was approved in China and, in July 2023, Sidapvia (dapagli/flozin and sitagliptin) was approved in Korea, both for the treatment of adults with T2D.\n- > With one of the broadest clinical pipelines in MASH and cirrhosis, we are investigating new therapeutic modalities and precision medicine to target genetic drivers of disease in MASH to stop or slow disease progression.\n- > In November, AstraZeneca and Eccogene entered into an exclusive licence agreement for AZD5004, an investigational oral once-daily glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA) currently in a US Phase I clinical trial for the treatment of obesity, T2D and other cardiometabolic conditions.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information on our commitment in amyloidosis, see page 30.",

Poor air quality and extreme weather pose great risks to people living with asthma and COPD, and increase the number of people developing these diseases. We are dedicated to discovering and developing respiratory medicines that improve outcomes for patients as well as lowering the carbon footprint of respiratory care which stems from the use of medicines, doctor visits and hospital care.\n\nEarly detection, diagnosis and disease control to avoid exacerbations are powerful ways to reduce overall healthcare resource utilisation and hospitalisations, and thus the carbon footprint of care. In addition to efforts to improve outcomes for patients, we are also decarbonising respiratory care by transitioning to climate-friendly inhaled medicines, moving our entire portfolio to a next-generation propellant with near-zero Global Warming Potential.\n\nCompounds in early-stage clinical development include:\n\n- > Mitiperstat, a selective MPO inhibitor in Phase II. A 10-fold increase in MPO (an enzyme associated with oxidative stress) concentration is associated with a 40% increase of risk of a COPD exacerbation.\n- > AZD6793, an oral IRAK4 inhibitor that targets many of the key pathways triggered by bacterial and viral infections, smoke and other environmental factors in COPD patients.\n\n## Asthma\n\nSymbicort maintained its position as the leading inhaled corticosteroid (ICS)/longacting beta2-agonist (LABA) globally by volume. Performance has been driven by strong growth in Emerging Markets, offset by generic erosion in the EU, US and Japan.\n\nIn January 2024, Airsupra launched in the US for the as-needed treatment or prevention of bronchoconstriction and to reduce the risk of exacerbations in people with asthma aged 18 years and older, offering the /first and only FDA approved anti-in/flammatory rescue therapy to treat airway obstruction and in/flammation concomitantly. AstraZeneca entered into a codevelopment agreement with Bond Avillion 2 Development in March 2018 for the development of the then drug candidate PT027 for asthma in the US.\n\nFasenra , our /first respiratory biologic has reached more than 119,000 patients with severe eosinophilic asthma. In April, we announced positive results from the MIRACLE Phase III trial, an ef/ficacy and safety study of Fasenra in patients in Asia with a history of uncontrolled severe eosinophilic asthma. A Phase III trial in COPD, RESOLUTE, is also ongoing.\n\nTezspire is the /first and only biologic approved for patients with severe asthma with no phenotype or biomarker limitation within its approved label. Tezspire 's strong performance\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ncontinues following approval, gaining market share and achieving broad labels and reimbursement globally.\n\nCompounds in early-stage clinical development for asthma include:\n\n- > AZD8630, an inhaled fragment antibody (inhaled biologic) in co-development with Amgen, that targets thymic stromal lymphopoietin.\n- > Atuli/flapon (AZD5718), a precision medicine approach in asthma with an oral 5-lipoxygenase-activating protein (FLAP) inhibitor that blocks the 5-lipoxygenase pathway, a clinically validated target which could offer an alternative for uncontrolled patients before becoming eligible for systemic biologics.\n- > AZD4604, an inhaled JAK1 inhibitor that has the potential to block the effects of T2-high pro-in/flammatory pathways (IL4/13, TSLP) and T2-lower pathways (IL6, IL17), many of which are poorly responsive to ICS in patients with asthma.\n\n## New Respiratory\n\nThe TILIA Phase III trial of tozorakimab in severe viral lower respiratory tract disease is ongoing.\n\nOther compounds in early-stage clinical development include:\n\n- > AZD0292, an anti-pseudomonas aeruginosa mAb for the treatment of bronchiectasis.\n\n## Immunology\n\nSaphnelo continues to grow rapidly during its launch phase and in June 2023, was included in the 2023 EULAR recommendations for the management of SLE, less than two years after /first launch.\n\nFasenra 's life-cycle management programme includes multiple clinical trials in eosinophilic diseases beyond the current severe asthma\n\nindication. In September 2023, we announced positive high-level results from the MANDARA Phase III trial which showed that Fasenra met the primary endpoint and demonstrated non-inferior rates of remission compared to mepolizumab in patients with EGPA who were receiving oral corticosteroids with or without stable immunosuppressive therapy. MANDARA is the /first head-to-head trial of biologics in EGPA, comparing a single injection of Fasenra to three injections of mepolizumab, every four weeks. Full results from the trial were presented in November 2023 at the American College of Rheumatology Convergence meeting.\n\nCompounds in early-stage clinical development include:\n\n- > AZD7798, a CCR9-depleting mAb. CCR9 is the main chemokine receptor for traf/ficking lymphocytes to the small intestine and considered central to the generation of small bowel in/flammation in Crohn's disease.\n\nIn June 2023, we announced an agreement with Quell Therapeutics to develop, manufacture and commercialise engineered T-regulator (Treg) cell therapies for autoimmune diseases in order to reset immune tolerance and drive durable responses for patients. In 2023, we also announced the proposed acquisition of Gracell Biotechnologies.\n\nIn June 2023, the clinical development programme for brazikumab, an anti-IL-23 mAb, in IBD was discontinued.",

In April 2023, AstraZeneca, Sobi and Sano/fi updated and simpli/fied their contractual arrangements relating to the development and commercialisation of Beyfortus in the US.\n\nIn July 2023, Beyfortus was approved in the US for the prevention of RSV LRTD in newborns and infants born during or entering their /first RSV season, and for children up to 24 months of age who remain vulnerable to severe RSV disease through their second RSV season. In the US, Beyfortus is the /first approved and recommended immunisation to prevent severe RSV disease in all infants under eight months by the CDC Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices.\n\nIn January 2024, Beyfortus was approved in China for the prevention of RSV LRTI in neonates and infants entering or during their /first RSV season and is anticipated to be available during the upcoming 2024 to 2025 RSV season.\n\nRegulatory applications are currently under review in Japan and other countries.\n\nSince its initial approval in 1998, Synagis has become a global SoC for RSV prevention and helps protect at-risk babies against RSV. In February 2023, new cost-effectiveness analysis of Synagis for the prevention of RSV infection in otherwise healthy Canadian infants born at 29-35 weeks' gestational age, was presented at the 7th Respiratory Syncytial Virus Foundation Conference in Lisbon, Portugal.\n\nOur agreement with Sobi for the rights to Synagis in the US remains ongoing.\n\nIn December 2023, AstraZeneca announced an agreement to acquire Icosavax, to bolster the Vaccines & Immune Therapies pipeline with a potential /first-in-class, Phase III-ready, combination vaccine against RSV and hMPV, using an innovative, protein virus-like particle platform.\n\n## COVID-19\n\nAZD3152 is an investigational next-generation LAAB being developed to potentially protect vulnerable patients such as the immunocompromised from COVID-19, given that they may not have any other non-vaccine option. In July 2023, AstraZeneca shared positive high-level results from the Phase I safety cohort of the ongoing SUPERNOVA Phase I/III COVID-19 prevention trial, which showed that AZD3152 was generally well-tolerated and displayed pharmacokinetics consistent with Evusheld through to day 29. AstraZeneca licensed AZD3152 from RQ Biotechnology in May 2022.",

Immunobridging trials which are well-established for testing vaccines - can help accelerate access to important new therapies, without compromising tolerability.\n\nAstraZeneca is helping to lead the way with innovative immunobridging trials to accelerate access to next-generation monoclonal antibodies for COVID-19, where alternatives to running large efficacy trials are especially important given the rapid pace of viral evolution and the need to potentially protect those at highest risk for severe disease.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn October 2023, AstraZeneca announced new data from two extensive real-world evidence studies, which highlighted that immunocompromised people continue to face signi/ficant and disproportionate burdens from COVID-19, with substantially higher rates of severe COVID-19 outcomes compared to the general population. The INFORM and EPOCH studies were published in Lancet Regional Health Europe and Current Medical Research and Opinion, respectively. Data from INFORM were presented at the 12th Annual IDWeek Conference.\n\nEvusheld is a LAAB combination for the pre-exposure prophylaxis (prevention) and treatment of COVID-19. All Product Sales in 2023 were derived from sales of Evusheld in the /first quarter.\n\nVaxzevria was co-invented by the University of Oxford. Through a landmark agreement in 2020, Vaxzevria was developed and distributed by AstraZeneca at cost during the pandemic. Total Revenue for COVID-19 medicines ( Vaxzevria and COVID-19 mAbs) declined signi/ficantly in 2023, due to the ful/filment of Vaxzevria contracts.\n\nEmergency Use Authorisation, based on positive results from the SUPERNOVA sub-study, was submitted in the US for the investigational LAAB sipavibart for preexposure prophylaxis of COVID-19 in an immunocompromised patient population.\n\nThe International Immunocompromised Advocacy Network, an independent, community-led network of more than 44 patient advocacy organisations, was launched in October 2023 with initial /financial sponsorship from AstraZeneca.\n\n## Influenza\n\nFluenz Tetra/ FluMist Quadrivalent is a live quadrivalent vaccine, given as an intranasal spray. It is the /first and only commercial intranasal /flu vaccine that offers a needle-free alternative to traditional /flu vaccinations. This year marked the 20th anniversary since the /first regulatory approval of FluMist / Fluenz .\n\nIn February 2023, AstraZeneca entered into an agreement with the US Government's Department of Defense via the Medical Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear Defense Consortium to develop a ribonucleic acid (RNA)-based universal pandemic in/fluenza vaccine. As part of this agreement, AstraZeneca will receive up to\n\napproximately $80 million over three years to develop the vaccine from preclinical research through a Phase I/II clinical study.\n\nIn March 2023, Japan's Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare approved FluMist Quadrivalent for children aged two to 18 years.

        "page_content": "## Therapy Area Review Rare Disease\n\n## continued\n\n## 2023 review - strategy in action Sustained leadership in complement\n\nAlexion was the first company to translate the complement system into transformative medicines. We are continuing that legacy of leadership across multiple disease areas, leveraging AstraZeneca's established footprint and expanding our global presence through Centres of Excellence to reach patients with high unmet medical need.\n\n2023 performance was underpinned by consistent, durable and strong business growth, driven by continued patient demand in gMG, a progressive, neuromuscular disease which can impact mobility, speech and breathing, together with launches in new markets and successful conversion from Soliris to Ultomiris across shared indications.\n\nThe EU and Japan approved our long-acting C5 inhibitor Ultomiris for the treatment of adults with NMOSD, a progressive autoimmune disease that impacts the central nervous system. With no relapses observed in the pivotal CHAMPION-NMOSD trial, Ultomiris marks a significant advance for NMOSD patients, offering dosing every eight weeks and the potential to live relapse-free. Regulatory reviews for Ultomiris for the treatment of NMOSD are ongoing in additional countries, including the US.\n\nWe have further expanded access to our first-in-class C5 inhibitor Soliris for patients with rare neurological diseases; Soliris has the potential to improve outcomes and quality of life for these patients and their families. Soliris has been approved in the EU and Japan for certain paediatric patients with refractory gMG, and was approved in China for the treatment of certain adults with gMG and certain adults with NMOSD.\n\nAdditional clinical trials of Ultomiris are ongoing in several disease areas where the complement pathway is thought to play a role, including Phase III trials in haematopoietic stem cell transplant-associated thrombotic microangiopathy and in cardiac surgeryassociated acute kidney injury. Following review of high-level results, we made the decision to discontinue a Phase II/III clinical trial evaluating Ultomiris in adults with dermatomyositis. No new safety findings were observed, and the safety data are consistent with the established safety profile of Ultomiris .\n\n## 70 countries\n\nOur Rare Disease medicines are now approved in 70 countries.\n\n## Beyond Soliris and Ultomiris\n\nWe are developing a broad portfolio of potential medicines that target various components of the complement system, with opportunities to pursue indications across a wide range of therapeutic areas of interest, including haematology, nephrology, neurology and ophthalmology.\n\nWe are exploring the ability to treat earlier-line and broader gMG patient populations in a Phase III trial with gefurulimab (ALXN1720), a next-generation C5 inhibitor that is selfadministered subcutaneously.\n\nWe are also evaluating potential treatments for certain rare nephrology conditions, including ALXN2030, an investigational small interfering RNA targeting the complement C3 protein.\n\n## Factor D inhibition\n\nWe have a robust portfolio of investigational medicines that inhibit the complement protein Factor D, including small molecule oral assets with potential broad application across several disease areas.\n\nVoydeya (danicopan) received the first-ever regulatory approval in Japan for the treatment of a subset of adults with PNH to be used in combination with C5 inhibitor therapy. The approval of Voydeya , a first-in-class, oral, Factor D inhibitor, was based on the positive results from the pivotal ALPHA Phase III trial; results from the 12-week primary evaluation period of the trial were published in The Lancet Haematology. Voydeya was developed as add-on to proven SoC Ultomiris or Soliris to address the needs of the subset of patients (approximately 10-20%) with PNH who experience clinically significant extravascular haemolysis (EVH) while treated with a C5 inhibitor. Regulatory submissions for Voydeya are currently under review with multiple global health authorities.\n\nAlexion is also evaluating Voydeya in an ongoing Phase II trial as a potential monotherapy for geographic atrophy, a chronic and progressive eye disease.\n\nAdditional investigational, oral Factor D inhibitors in clinical development are:\n\n- > Vemircopan (ALXN 2050) in ongoing Phase II clinical trials in a number of rare diseases.\n- > ALXN2080 in an ongoing Phase I trial.\n\n## Expanding beyond complement\n\nWe have continued to expand our rare disease focus with novel assets for non-complement mediated diseases.\n\nAmyloidosis is a group of complex rare diseases, with varying types and severities. Alexion and AstraZeneca are advancing the industry's largest amyloidosis pipeline, across a broad range of modalities, to address the spectrum of patient need across multiple disease subtypes.\n\n## Amyloid light chain (AL) amyloidosis\n\nIn AL amyloidosis, misfolded abnormal proteins build up and form toxic amyloid deposits in organs throughout the body (including the heart and kidneys), causing significant organ damage and failure that may ultimately be fatal.\n\nAnselamimab (CAEL-101), a potentially first-in-class fibril-reactive mAb for the treatment of AL amyloidosis, is currently being evaluated in the Cardiac Amyloid Reaching for Extended Survival (CARES) Phase III clinical programme in combination with SoC therapy in AL amyloidosis. Two parallel Phase III trials in patients with Mayo Stage IIIa and Stage IIIb disease, respectively, are ongoing.\n\n## Transthyretin amyloidosis (ATTR)\n\nATTR cardiomyopathy (ATTR-CM) is a systemic, progressive and fatal condition that leads to HF and a high rate of fatality within four years from diagnosis.\n\nAlexion holds an exclusive licence from Neurimmune to develop and commercialise ALXN2220 (NI006), an investigational mAb that specifically targets misfolded transthyretin. ALXN2220 is designed to directly address the pathology of ATTR-CM by enabling removal of amyloid fibril deposits in the heart, with the potential to treat patients with advanced ATTR-CM.\n\nPositive Phase I results were published in the New England Journal of Medicine for ALXN2220 in the treatment of patients with ATTR-CM and HF, indicating a favourable safety profile as well as a substantial reduction of cardiac amyloid deposition over a 12-month period, and a Phase III trial of ALXN2220 is underway.\n\nPositive high-level results from the Japan Phase III trial of acoramidis (ALXN2060) in adults with ATTR-CM showed consistency to those in the global BridgeBio ATTRibute-CM Phase III trial, including survival, cardiacrelated hospitalisations and other measures of improved functions and quality of life at 30 months. Alexion holds an exclusive licence from BridgeBio's subsidiary, Eidos Therapeutics, Inc., to develop and commercialise acoramidis in Japan; this trial in Japan was conducted to support local registration.",

Efzimfotase alfa is designed to help reduce the treatment burden for patients via more convenient dosing and subcutaneous administration. A Phase III trial has been initiated to evaluate efzimfotase alfa in adolescent and adult HPP patients who have not previously been treated with Strensiq .\n\n## Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) Plexiform Neurofibromas (PN)\n\nNF1 PN is a rare, progressive, genetic condition impacting multiple body systems characterised by benign tumours called plexiform neurofibromas, which develop along nerve sheaths throughout the body.\n\nIn May 2023, Koselugo was approved in China for paediatric patients with NF1 and PNs.\n\n## Wilson disease\n\nWe announced the difficult decision to terminate the ALXN1840 programme in Wilson disease based on review of results from Phase II mechanistic trials and discussions with regulatory authorities.\n\n## Rare cancers\n\nRare cancers account for approximately 27% of cancer deaths and have a lower five-year survival rate than most common cancers, representing a significant unmet medical need. For example, glioblastoma is a rare brain cancer that is almost always fatal, with a five-year overall survival rate of less than 10% following diagnosis. We are partnering with colleagues across AstraZeneca to follow the science and identify opportunities where we can leverage our expertise and infrastructure to deliver transformative outcomes for patients.",

        "page_content": "## Our R&D in 2023\n\nIn 2023, we continued to progress our science, focusing on four key areas of transformative science. Our scientists published 808 manuscripts with 158 in 'high-impact' peer-reviewed journals, each with an impact factor exceeding 15 (Thomson Reuters five-year impact factor score). The ongoing high impact continues to reflect the quality of, and drive to share, our science.\n\n## Enhancing our understanding of disease biology\n\nAdvancing our understanding of disease biology is helping uncover novel drivers for the diseases we aim to prevent, treat and in the future, cure. Selecting the right target remains the most important decision in drug discovery.\n\n## 2023 developments included:\n\n- > Demonstrating the power of combining genomics with proteomics to discover how rare changes in genes affect plasma proteins by using data from more than 50,000 individuals in the UK Biobank. This study, published in Nature, is the largest of its kind.\n- > Together with academic and biopharmaceutical industry partners, we launched Together For Change, a 10-year initiative to close the gap on historical health care inequities, education and training by building more diversity in genetic research, accelerating education pathways, and improving genomic tools for people of African ancestry.\n- > Publishing in several high-impact journals, including Nature , reflecting our progress in understanding the role that tumourassociated myeloid cells with immunosuppressive properties play in poor patient outcomes and in treatment resistance in cancer.\n- > Establishing a new world-class functional genomics laboratory with the Medical Research Council and the Milner Therapeutics Institute at the University of Cambridge to accelerate drug discovery and further the UK's global genomics leadership. Innovative collaborations such as this allow us to share resources and expertise to advance science for the benefit of patients.\n- > Working with Ad Scientiam to develop digital biomarkers to improve symptom tracking for rare neurological and neuromuscular diseases.\n\n## Creating the next generation of therapeutics\n\nWe continue to design new ways of targeting the drivers of disease. The diversity of technologies applied in our early pipeline is exemplified by the increased number of new modalities entering clinical development, including ADCs, antibodies (e.g. bispecific, inhaled fragment, cell depleting monoclonal), cell therapies, genomic medicines, PROTACs, oligonucleotides and T-cell engagers.\n\n## 2023 developments included:\n\n- > Advancing novel engineered Treg cell therapies designed to induce durable immune tolerance as a potential cure for serious immune-mediated diseases. This is being explored in type-1 diabetes (T1D) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in a new strategic collaboration with Quell Therapeutics.\n- > Demonstrating the strength of our proprietary ADC technology by advancing AZD9592 (epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) cMET bispecific) and AZD5335 (FR ) into the clinic.\n- > Advancing our ambition to bring cell therapies to solid tumours by disclosing two novel CAR-Ts - AZD0574 (STEAP2) and AZD6422 (Claudin 18.2) - designed utilising our innovative armouring technology to resist the immunosuppressive tumour microenvironment, and progressing our first T-cell receptor therapies - NT-125 (fully individualised) and NT-175 (TP53) - into the clinic through Neogene.\n- > Accelerating our cell therapy and genomic medicine ambitions in areas of high unmet medical need across oncology, immunology and rare diseases, via a collaboration and investment agreement with Cellectis to leverage gene editing technologies and manufacturing capabilities, via the proposed acquisition of Gracell, which includes a clinical-stage autologous BCMA/CD19 CAR-T therapy targeting haematologic malignancies and autoimmune diseases and a proprietary cell therapy manufacturing platform, and via the acquisition of a portfolio of preclinical rare disease gene therapies from Pfizer.\n\n## Better predicting clinical success of our candidate drug molecules\n\nWe are adopting a range of cutting-edge technologies, generating data that are more relevant to patients than previous methods, to help us predict the clinical effectiveness of our candidate drug molecules.\n\n## 2023 developments included:\n\n- > Collaborating with Verge Genomics to more efficiently identify and validate therapeutic targets for rare diseases by leveraging Verge's AI-enabled platform trained on patient tissue samples.\n\n- > Under our collaboration with GRAIL, new data showed the promise of the GRAIL methylation assay for detecting residual disease in blood cancer following treatment, with potential to inform early intervention strategies.\n- > Collaborating with Qureight to leverage imaging data analytics and AI models to better understand how patients with rare and complex lung diseases could respond to novel drugs.\n- > Pioneering the use of Quantitative Continuous Scoring (QCS), our novel, fully automated computational pathology solution, within our clinical trial portfolio. Early clinical studies have shown that QCS can identify the right patient populations suitable for targeted therapies, such as ADCs.\n- > Publishing findings in Advanced Science that show our ability to develop novel microphysiological systems that can combine multiple cell types and reproduce the structures of functioning organs to accurately recreate key aspects of kidney biology in the lab for the first time.\n\n## Pioneering new approaches to engagement in the clinic\n\nWe are pioneering clinical innovation to design and deliver patient-centric clinical trials that improve the patient and site team experience while optimising the use of data, digital and AI to improve patient outcomes in clinical trials and beyond.\n\n## 2023 developments included:\n\n- > Publishing in Nature Medicine our 6R framework for implementing digital health technology in clinical trials based on qualitative research. This showed how technology is enabling a shift from the traditional physical site-based trial model, reducing the burden on patients and trial sites and enabling continuous data collection while driving more innovative trial designs.\n- > Collaborating with existing UK NHS lung cancer screening programmes, research sites and investigators to identify COPD patients eligible for clinical trials. The initiative also strengthens our understanding of factors contributing to resilience and early disease development.\n- > Launching Evinova to bring to market digital health solutions that are science-based, evidence-led and human-experience driven. Evinova will prioritise digital solutions to optimise clinical trial design and delivery.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information on Quell, Cellectis, Gracell and Pfizer deals, see Business development on page 42.",

Our key principles are set out in our Global Standard.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Clinical trial transparency\n\nWe believe that transparency enhances the understanding of how our medicines work, which benefits patients. We publish information about our clinical research, as well as the registration and results of all our interventional clinical trials and most non-interventional trials for all products - regardless of whether the results are favourable. This includes completed trials for marketed medicines, drugs in development and drugs where development has been discontinued.\n\nAs of 31 December 2023, AstraZeneca had:\n\n- > Shared anonymised individual patient-level data from 270 unique studies.\n- > Responded to 364 requests from external researchers using our portal, www.vivli.org, and/or scientific collaborations, for our clinical data and reports to support their research.\n- > Published 23 Anonymised Clinical Document Packages.\n- > Published 401 Trial Result Summaries in accessible language and translated these into 63 languages for all study sites on the industry-wide portal www.trialsummaries.com.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information, see www.astrazeneca.com/ sustainability/resources.html.\n\n## Research use of human biological samples and genomic information\n\nWe use human biological samples and genomic information for research into better understanding of diseases, improved diagnosis, and other healthcare improvements, as well as for the research and development of new medicines. We are committed to minimising the use of human foetal tissue (hFT) through scientific advancements. Permission is granted only when no other scientifically reasonable alternative is available, or there is a regulatory requirement. There were two new hFT approvals in 2023. To date, eight projects using hFT have been approved, and three projects are ongoing.\n\n## Animals in research\n\nAnimal studies remain a small, but necessary part of discovering, developing and licensing life-changing medicines.\n\nAstraZeneca is committed to the 3Rs (Replacement, Reduction and Refinement of animals in research) and has programmes to accelerate the development of new approach methodologies, which have potential to reduce and eventually replace the need for animals. We focus on robust experimental design and analysis to ensure the fewest animals are needed to achieve scientific objectives, with our scientists refining procedures and applying high standards of animal care.\n\nAnimals were needed for in-house studies 122,768 times in 2023 (100,803 in 2022), and on our behalf in contract research studies 59,690 times (53,377\u00b9 in 2022). In total, over 97% were rodents or fish, with the majority being mice (84%). The remainder is made up of rabbits, camelids, ferrets, dogs, pigs, non-human primates, chickens and sheep. Dogs and non-human primates make up less than 1% of the total.

During the year, we had an active presence in 85 countries and sold our products in more than 125 countries. In most markets, we sell our medicines through wholly-owned local marketing companies. We also sell through distributors and local representative offices. We market our products largely to primary and specialty care physicians.\n\n## Our regions\n\nWe strive to meet our growth and profitability goals through commercial excellence in each of our global reporting regions.\n\n## US\n\nAs the tenth-largest prescription-based pharmaceutical company in the US, we have a 3.6% market share of US pharmaceuticals by sales value. Total Revenue increased by 6% in 2023 to $19,077 million, driven by the continued growth of our Oncology medicines and Farxiga . Recent launches in heart failure and chronic kidney disease drove an increase in market share.\n\nThe US healthcare system is complex. Multiple payers and intermediaries influence patient access to branded medicines through regulatory rebates in government programmes and voluntary rebates paid to managed care organisations and pharmacy benefit managers for commercially insured patients. Significant pricing pressure is driven by payer consolidation, restrictive reimbursement policies and cost control tools, such as exclusionary formularies and price protection clauses. Many formularies employ 'generic first' strategies and/or require physicians to obtain prior approval for the use of a branded medicine where a generic alternative exists.\n\nThe Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022 was passed to address affordability concerns. Farxiga has been selected in the first round of negotiations under the IRA, with the price taking effect in 2026, which is the same year we expect to lose exclusivity, and the impact is therefore expected to be manageable. We are evaluating our portfolio to understand timings associated with the potential inclusion of other medicines in future negotiations. We have a diversified product portfolio providing a broad spectrum of treatments in different therapy areas, allowing access for patients in need of our innovative medicines.\n\n## Europe\n\nThe total European pharmaceutical market was worth $248 billion in 2023. We are the seventh-largest prescription-based pharmaceutical company in Europe (see market definitions on page 232) with a 3.3% market share of pharmaceutical sales by value. Total Revenue was $9,611 million, up 10% (8% at CER).\n\n## Our performance in 2023\n\n- > Total Revenue, comprising Product Sales, Alliance Revenue and Collaboration Revenue, increased by 3% (6% at CER) to $45,811 million. Total Revenue excluding COVID-19 medicines increased by 13% (15% at CER) to $45,488 million.\n- > In the US, Total Revenue increased by 6% to $19,077 million and in Europe by 10% (8% at CER) to $9,611 million.\n- > Total Revenue in Emerging Markets increased by 2% (9% at CER) to $12,025 million, with an increase in China of 1% (7% at CER) to $5,876 million.\n- > Continued collaboration with payers to conclude outcomes- and value-based reimbursement models that improve patient outcomes and enable access to medicines.\n- > Committed to high ethical standards: 296 employees and third parties were removed from their roles for breaches of sales and marketing regulations or codes.\n- > Delivered 282 successful market launches.\n- > Completed more than 20 major or strategically important business development transactions.",

In 2023, Total Revenue decreased by 14% (8% at CER) to $5,099 million, with sales in Japan down 10% (3% at CER) to $3,705 million.\n\n## Emerging Markets\n\nWith Total Revenue of $12,025 million, up 2% (9% at CER), AstraZeneca was the secondlargest multinational pharmaceutical company, as measured by prescription sales, and the fifth fastest-growing top 10 multinational pharmaceutical company in Emerging Markets in 2023.\n\nIn China, AstraZeneca is the largest pharmaceutical company in the hospital sector, as measured by sales value. In 2023, Total Revenue increased by 1% at actual rate of exchange (7% at CER) to $5,876 million (2022: $5,792 million). Roxadustat and Lokelma were renewed in the National Reimbursement Drug List (NRDL) and Xigduo , Tagrisso (ADAURA), Lynparza (PAOLA-1), Calquence , Soliris and Koselugo achieved listing for the first time. Since the implementation of VBP, several AstraZeneca brands have been impacted. In the most recent cycles of VBP implementation, Faslodex and Plendil were included. Additional AstraZeneca brands are expected to be included in future VBP cycles. There was some impact on demand in the second half of the year, mainly with oncology products, following the government anticorruption campaign announced in July 2023.\n\nWe were shocked following the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 and, since then, have provided practical support to ensure the safety, health and wellbeing of our employees. As a healthcare business, we are doing everything possible to ensure medical supply chains continue to operate and that patients in both countries are able to access our medicines, while complying with sanctions imposed on Russia.\n\n## Healthcare in low- and middleincome countries BV\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAstraZeneca is committed to building resilient and sustainable health systems and improving equitable access to healthcare. By working collaboratively, we remove barriers to care and support the development and delivery of healthcare, particularly in low- and middleincome countries. We also adapt our programmes to suit local health systems and communities, contributing to health system capacity and resilience through training, education, prevention and early detection and diagnosis.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Pricing and value of our medicines\n\nIncreasing demand for healthcare means increasing pressure on health system budgets. This shift results in price and reimbursement restrictions in many markets. These pressures also result in movement from primary to speciality care, including rare diseases, which comprise a growing share of our portfolio. This pricing pressure, coupled with higher rates of inflation, means that we are unable to pass on the full impact of price increases.\n\nPricing for our medicines seeks to reflect the value they bring to patients, payers and society, and the significant investment required for targeted treatment options. In our discussions with national, regional and local stakeholders, we base our pricing policies on four principles: sustainability, value, access and flexibility. We collaborate with payers to conclude innovative outcomes and valuebased reimbursement models that improve patient outcomes and enable access to medicines across key therapeutic areas and geographic regions. We also offer a number of patient assistance programmes that help increase patients' access to medicines and/or healthcare by reducing their cost burden.\n\n## Responsible sales and marketing\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAs outlined in the Code of Ethics on page 49, we are committed to high ethical standards. Our compliance professionals advise on, and monitor, adherence to our Code and policies, and work with local staff to ensure we meet our ethical standards.\n\nNominated signatories review product promotional materials and activities to ensure compliance with applicable regulations and codes of practice, and that information is accurate and balanced. Group Internal Audit conducts audits of selected marketing companies.\n\nWe are the second-largest prescription-based pharmaceutical manufacturer with a 6.1% value market share of Innovative Branded pharmaceutical sales by value, and have gained recognition as being a great place to work by the Great Place to Work Institute.\n\nIn 2023, we identified four confirmed external breaches across our Commercial business (2022: 10). There were 3,758 instances (instances can involve multiple people) of employee and third-party non-compliance with our policies (2022: 2,872). A total of 296 employees and third parties were removed from their role as a result of a breach (2022: 147) and 2,968 received warnings (2022: 3,326). We brief our Audit Committee quarterly on breach statistics, serious incidents and corresponding remediation.\n\nBreaches primarily consist of low-impact incidents. We continue to foster a culture where employees can speak their minds, with strong first-line oversight (and related reporting) as well as targeted second-line monitoring to identify concerns early, and use learnings to improve our programme.\n\n## Anti-bribery and anti-corruption\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe do not tolerate bribery or any other form of corruption. Preventing bribery and corruption are a focus of our third-party risk management and due diligence processes, as well as our monitoring and audit programmes. We reinforce our commitment to ethical business conduct through our annual Code of Ethics training, which is delivered to all employees and relevant third parties.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information, see Access to healthcare from page 47.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information on our pricing policies, see our Sustainability Report on our website, www.astrazeneca.com/ sustainability.",

As members of the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Associations (IFPMA) and the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations (EFPIA), we adhere to their codes.\n\n## Managing our supply chain\n\nDuring 2023, the world environment continued to be volatile and uncertain. The geopolitical events, trade sanctions, regulatory changes and high inflation are types of challenges that continue to require rapid operational responses. We continued to successfully meet our responsibilities to patients ensuring supply of our life-saving medicines with robust supply chain operations and reduced end-to-end supply lead times. We delivered increased demand and growth opportunities with flexibility and agility. As the regulatory environment evolves post COVID-19, AstraZeneca continues to deliver industryleading quality performance. FDA recall data from 2020 to 2023 showed that AstraZeneca had zero recalls during this period.\n\n## Supply chain finance\n\nAstraZeneca has a supply chain finance programme to support the cash flow of our external supply base. The programme is managed by Taulia Inc. (with funding provided by some of the Group's relationship banks) and provides suppliers with visibility of invoices and payment dates via a dedicated platform. Suppliers can access this platform free of charge and have flexibility to select individual invoices for early payment. On election of an early payment, a charge is incurred by the supplier based on the period of acceleration, central bank interest rate and the rate agreed between Taulia Inc. and each supplier. All early payments are processed by the funders and AstraZeneca settles the original invoice amount with the funders at maturity of the original invoice due date. The programme operates in the US, UK, Sweden and Germany. As at 31 December 2023, the programme had 432 suppliers enrolled and a potential early payment balance of $112 million. We have a separate programme in China with 29 suppliers enrolled and a potential early payment balance of $11 million.\n\nIn 2023, we made strong progress against our Operations 2025 strategy, focused on scaling our capabilities to support business growth, leveraging the benefits of new manufacturing technology and digital innovation:\n\n- > Delivered 282 launches across major markets.\n\n## Responsible supply chain\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAll employees and contractors who source goods and services on behalf of AstraZeneca are expected to follow our Global Standard for Procuring Goods and Services. Through assessments and improvement programmes, including our third-party risk management system, we monitor supplier compliance with our published Global Standard on Expectations of Third Parties and Code of Ethics. In 2023, we conducted 47 audits (2022: 42) on high-risk commercial suppliers (external manufacturing partners) to ensure appropriate practices and controls. Of these, 50% fully met our expectations while 45% had improvement plans for minor instances of non-compliance. There were two audits indicating a high risk to AstraZeneca and action has been taken to mitigate these supply and/or reputational risks. We also use EcoVadis scores to assess and improve supplier sustainability performance.\n\nOur Sustainable Procurement Programme embeds responsible sourcing practices and promotes ethical behaviour, aiming to achieve 100% ethical spend with suppliers who share our Values. This fosters their progress on sustainability, enables us to innovate together and accelerates supplier diversity. Our Supplier Diversity Programme maximises opportunities for small and diverse businesses to be part of our value chain and supports their growth. In 2023, we reached our ambition to have active supplier diversity programmes in 10 countries outside the US by 2025, with Switzerland, Ireland and Canada joining Brazil, South Africa, the UK, Australia, New Zealand, Poland and Sweden.\n\n## Global manufacturing capability\n\nOur principal tablet and capsule formulation and packing sites are in the UK, Sweden, China, Puerto Rico and the US, with local supply sites in Egypt, India, Japan and Russia, and regional supply sites in Brazil, Indonesia, France and Mexico. We also have major formulation sites for the global supply of parenteral and/or inhalation products in the US, Sweden, France, Australia and the UK. Most of the manufacture of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) is delivered through the efficient use of external sourcing that is complemented by internal capabilities. For biologics, our principal commercial manufacturing facilities are in the US,\n\n- > Progressed our investments in manufacturing technologies, new modalities and digital innovations.\n- > Five sites within the network - Nijmegen, Cairo, Cikarang, Lomas Verdes and Cotia - have delivered a 98% reduction in Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions (from 2015 baseline) measured against science-based targets.\n\nSweden, the UK and the Netherlands. Our network contains capabilities in process development, drug substance, drug product manufacturing and distribution, including global supply of mAbs and influenza vaccines.\n\nIn January 2023, we finalised the sale of our West Chester site in Ohio, US, to National Resilience, Inc. This enabled the continued supply of AstraZeneca medicines produced at the site to patients, as well as continued employment for more than 500 people working at the site. We continue to pursue growth opportunities in China. In March 2023, we announced plans for a new facility in Qingdao to manufacture pressurised metered-dose inhalers (pMDIs) for respiratory products. In May 2023, AstraZeneca leased a facility in Rockville, Maryland, US. This facility will be fitted out for cell therapy manufacture to support clinical and commercial supply. In October 2023, we announced our intent to exit our supply site in Bangalore, India.\n\nAlexion has internal manufacturing facilities and also works with third-party contract manufacturers to supply clinical and commercial quantities of our products and product candidates. Our internal manufacturing capability includes a fill/finish facility at our Athlone site and a packaging and labelling facility at our Dublin site. Our drug substance manufacturing capabilities are shared between Athlone and Dublin and we have a large-scale drug substance facility in Dublin.\n\nAt the end of 2023, we employed 15,609 people at 27 Operations sites in 16 countries.",

We achieve this by cultivating a great place to work that values and rewards innovation, entrepreneurship and outstanding performance.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nUnlocking the potential of our people Our award-winning coaching strategy helps employees learn, adapt and grow.\n\n## Performing as an enterprise team\n\nBuilding diverse talent and critical capabilities In 2023, we successfully completed the integration of Alexion employees into AstraZeneca by:\n\n- > Migrating 4,900 employees from Alexion to AstraZeneca.\n- > Transitioning more than 100 employees from Alexion to AstraZeneca as a result of portfolio realignments.\n- > Launching more than 200 new learning pathways on Degreed, our training platform.\n- > Giving Alexion employees access to our CatAlyZe recognition platform - with 30,000 awards issued.\n- > Holding more than 200 'Go-live' workshops with HR in support of employees and managers.\n- > Aligning Alexion employees to AstraZeneca employment benefits and policies in 20 countries.\n\n## Creating a culture of high performance\n\nSince the removal of performance ratings in 2021, our primary focus has shifted towards coaching, development and the contributions of our employees. To aid managers in developing their teams, we deliver 80 performance development workshops each year. So far these have been attended by over 14,000 line managers. The effectiveness of our performance approach can be seen in the completion rate of end-of-year insights. In our 2023 performance development cycle, 96% of employees and 97% of managers successfully completed their year-end insights promoting accountability and goal alignment, and enabling fair and objective evaluation.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAn essential element of our performance development approach is the provision of continuous recognition. In 2023, 535,979 rewards were distributed to 87% of employees through our recognition platform. Notably, 24% of these awards were cross-functional, highlighting the collaborative and cohesive nature of our organisation.\n\n## Listening to our workforce\n\nListening to our workforce is important in ensuring AstraZeneca continues to be a great place to work and we encourage employees to speak their minds. In 2023, feedback mechanisms included onboarding surveys, exit interviews and our global employee engagement survey. The results of our engagement survey are shared with the Board of Directors, Senior Executive Team (SET), line managers and employees to ensure full transparency.\n\nKey highlights:\n\n- > 92% participation in global engagement survey.\n- > 89% of employees stated they believe strongly in AstraZeneca's future direction and key priorities.\n- > 89% of employees stated they had at least one development discussion with their manager.\n- > In exit interviews, more than 92% of employees who left said they would consider working at AstraZeneca again.\n- > We received an average rating of 4.6 out of five from successful hires in our Candidate Experience survey.\n\n## Advancing a culture of lifelong learning and development\n\nCentral to our success is ensuring our employees, managers and teams have the potential to develop and grow.

        "page_content": "## Champions of inclusion and diversity\n\nOur global commitment to inclusion and diversity (I&D) is woven into everything we do, and is reflected in our Values and the behaviours that underpin them.\n\nWomen comprise 53.9% (approximately 47,800) of our global workforce. At the end of 2023, there were six women on our Board (46.2% of the total). Following the retirement of Katarina Ageborg in January 2023 and the appointment of Sharon Barr as Executive Vice-President, BioPharmaceuticals R&D in August 2023, five out of 12 SET members (41.7%) were women at the end of the year. Mene Pangalos will be retiring in early 2024.\n\nOur employees represent a diverse range of backgrounds, coming from 179 countries. In 2023, to promote inclusion and diversity, we have established the Global Inclusion and Diversity Ambassador Group, which is led by senior leaders and sponsored by our CEO. This group reflects the diversity of our global workforce and organisational structure. They are responsible for collaborating with local leaders to customise approaches that address local needs and drive progress towards our global inclusion and diversity commitments.\n\nOur Board of Directors and the SET conduct biannual and quarterly reviews, respectively, of our workforce composition, covering gender, ethnicity and age representation. In the US, where we have more comprehensive data available, 36.7% of our workforce identify as an ethnic minority (2022: 35.7%). In 2023, we rolled out pay equity training to all line managers of US-based employees to ensure equitable reward and compensation.\n\nWe are committed to hiring and promoting talent ethically and in compliance with applicable laws. Our Code of Ethics (the Code) and its supporting Standards are designed to help protect against unlawful discrimination on any grounds, including disability. The Code covers recruitment and selection, performance management, career development and promotion, transfer, training (including, if needed, for people who have become disabled), and reward. AstraZeneca embraces the cognitive differences of neurodivergent employees and supports employees with both seen and unseen disabilities in line with their country-specific laws and regulations. Where risk assessments can be performed, we will consider accommodating adjustments to the working environment that support an inclusive and safe workplace. Our Global Standard for Inclusion and Diversity sets out how we foster an inclusive and diverse workforce where\n\neveryone feels valued and respected because of their individual abilities and perspectives.\n\nIn 2023, our I&D efforts earned recognition externally. We were featured in:\n\n- > Forbes World's Top Companies for Women\n- > Forbes World's Best Employers\n- > Financial Times, Diversity Leaders\n- > Diversity Inc. Top 50 Companies for Diversity (US)\n- > TIME World's Best Companies.\n\n## Human rights\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur human rights principles support the basic rights of all people, such as the right to health, freedom from slavery, and privacy. Our Code of Ethics, Human Rights Statement and Expectations of Third Parties commit us to respecting and promoting international human rights, both within our own operations but also our wider spheres of influence. This includes working only with third parties who share our approach. To that end, we integrate human rights considerations into our processes and practices. We are also committed to ensuring that there is no modern slavery or human trafficking in our value chains, or any part of our business. Our human rights policies are designed to ensure we consider the impact of our operations including our interactions with third parties on human rights. The output of our work to mitigate human rights risks is detailed in our Modern Slavery Statement which is published annually. We provide assurance annually to the Audit Committee.\n\n## Employee relations\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur Employee Relations function takes a global approach to employment principles and standards, local laws and good practice. Our ambition is to build a positive and safe working environment for employees through global policies and processes. To achieve this, our Employee Relations function works in partnership with Legal, Compliance, HR and Employee Representative groups, such as the European Consultation Committee, works councils and unions. According to our biennial Human Rights survey, the most recent of which was carried out in 2022, 45% of our countries have a relationship with trade unions.\n\nOf those countries that do not have a relationship with trade unions, 95% of them have established arrangements to engage similarly with their workforce.\n\n## Workforce safety and health\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe are committed to providing a safe and healthy working environment for our employees and partners. Our Global Safety, Health and Environment (SHE) Standard describes our commitment to, management of, and accountability for SHE.\n\nWe set and monitor our safety and health targets to support our workforce and aim to achieve the highest performance standards. Our work-related injury rate reduced by 59.6% from the 2015 baseline. AstraZeneca responded to an increasing collision trend in 2022 by developing a safe driving campaign and training endorsed by the Commercial SHE Executive Committee. This campaign continued into 2023 and has shown a positive impact on collisions per million kilometres (CPMK). In 2023, the CPMK was 1.96, exceeding the 2.5 target for the year and on course to meet or exceed the target for 2025 of 1.90.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information on our standards and Code of Ethics and for our full statement detailing how we work to mitigate the risks of modern slavery, see our website, www.astrazeneca.com/ sustainability/resources.html.",

As a global business, we are playing our part by operating ethically and responsibly, and helping tackle the biggest challenges of our time, including climate change, biodiversity loss and global health equity. These challenges are interdependent and require collaboration to be successfully addressed, implementing a variety of approaches across a network of relationships. By working together to find science-based solutions, we believe we can drive real change and build a better future.\n\n## Governance\n\nOur sustainability strategy is developed by the SET, which reviews our sustainability scorecard quarterly, and is approved by the Board. Our Board Sustainability Committee monitors the execution of the sustainability strategy, overseeing the communication of our activities with stakeholders, and providing input to the Board and other Board Committees as required.\n\n## Sustainability strategy\n\nWe assess the relevance of our material focus areas through continuous dialogue with our stakeholders and horizon-scanning for developments. Since 2021, our nine priority focus areas have been grouped under three interconnected strategic priority pillars:\n\nAccess to healthcare\n\nEthics and transparency\n\nEquitable access\n\nAffordability and pricing\n\nHealth system resilience\n\nEthical business culture\n\nInclusion and diversity\n\nWorkforce safety and health\n\nEnvironmental protection\n\nAmbition Zero Carbon\n\nProduct sustainability\n\nNatural resources\n\n## Benchmarking and assurance\n\nWe contribute to key global environmental, social and governance (ESG) performance evaluations, recognising the value of independent third-party assessment and insights. Our performance is also assessed independently based on the information and data we make publicly available. Bureau Veritas has provided limited independent assurance for the sustainability information contained within this Annual Report and Form 20-F. Assurance is in accordance with the International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000 (Revised) and ISAE 3410 Assurance Engagements on Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Statements.",

        "page_content": "## Access to healthcare\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe want to secure a future where all people have access to affordable, sustainable and innovative healthcare, throughout the patient care pathway, from prevention, early detection and diagnosis, to the effective treatment of disease. We are working to remove barriers, deliver innovative medicines and strengthen health system infrastructure and resilience through global and local partnerships, across all our focus areas.\n\n## Achievements in 2023\n\n- > We reached more than 66 million people (cumulatively) through access to healthcare programmes.\n- > Healthy Heart Africa trained more than 11,300 healthcare workers (cumulatively) and conducted more than 47 million screenings (cumulatively) for elevated blood pressure.\n- > Young Health Programme directly reached more than 15 million young people (cumulatively) and trained over 580,000 as Peer Educators since launch in 2010 in more than 40 countries.\n- > We reached more than 13 million people (cumulatively) through our patient access programmes, enabling sustainable access to AstraZeneca medicines in around 25 countries, most of which were low- and middle-income countries.\n\n## Equitable access\n\nYour health should not be determined by who you are, where you live or where you were born. We are working to remove barriers to healthcare and give everyone the chance to be as healthy as possible.\n\n## Diversity in clinical trials\n\nWe are committed to designing clinical programmes with equity at the forefront, from idea inception to patient care. Our approach is patient-centric, data-driven and science-led. We are improving the diversity of clinical trial participants with strong data foundations, tools and standards for aligning and tracking progress, and external partnerships. We work with industry groups, regulatory agencies, and local community groups to shape clinical trial diversity policies for the future, while delivering for patients today.\n\n## Rare diseases\n\nMore than 10,000 rare diseases are estimated to exist today, but fewer than 10% have approved treatment options. Rare disease community members face many unique challenges in pursuing equitable access to healthcare, such as significant delays in diagnosis, greater chances of hospitalisation from preventable conditions, scheduling and travelling to appointments, and accessing available treatments.\n\nWe believe people with rare diseases deserve the same attention and investment to find and access therapies as anyone else.\n\nAs we expand the geographies where our rare disease medicines are available, we continue to build relationships with patient communities early in our development programmes to better understand their needs. We focus on: increasing clinical trial diversity; developing improved data collection processes to enhance our understanding of how rare diseases affect specific patient populations; improving access to diagnostic tools; and supporting efforts to improve the experience of those participating in our clinical trials. We also supply medicines for rare diseases through patient support and access programmes.\n\n## Improving access to digital solutions\n\nThrough our A.Catalyst Network innovative partnerships, we are harnessing the latest technologies to improve patient outcomes, make healthcare more accessible and personalised, and drive efficiencies in health systems. As participants in EDISON Alliance's One Billion Lives Challenge, we aim to screen five million patients for lung cancer risk by 2025, using AI-based technology in collaboration with Qure.ai.\n\n## Affordability and pricing\n\nWe are committed to addressing barriers to access and affordability. Industry, policymakers and payers need to work together to identify solutions. Through collaborations, partnerships and stakeholder coalitions, we are working to ensure essential and innovative medicines become more widely available.\n\n## Health system resilience\n\nSustainable healthcare for all requires stronger health systems to deliver an infrastructure designed to be resilient, inclusive and responsive to the needs of the population it serves. We are investing in ground-breaking global collaborations, driving multisectoral policy and action, empowering local partnerships and fast-tracking innovation to expand access to higher quality healthcare.\n\n## Partnership for Health System Sustainability and Resilience (PHSSR)\n\nThe PHSSR is a non-profit, multisector, global collaboration with a unified goal of building more sustainable and resilient health systems, active in more than 30 countries. PHSSR has commissioned over 20 research reports to date, providing independent, evidence-based recommendations to strengthen health systems and facilitate cross-border bestpractice sharing, working with national experts with first-hand experience.\n\nIn 2023, PHSSR published its second Summary Report with insights from 18 countries, and launched research on seven new Asia-Pacific countries. PHSSR also established an EU expert advisory group, to support EU policymakers in improving policies on prevention and early detection of NCDs. By fostering joint learning and action through high-level stakeholder engagement at over\n\n40 global, regional and national platforms, the PHSSR catalysed efforts to strengthen health systems around the world.\n\n## Healthy Heart Africa programme\n\nOur Healthy Heart Africa programme is committed to reducing hypertension and the burden of cardiovascular disease, aiming to reach 10 million people with elevated blood pressure across Africa by 2025. We work with local and global partners to raise awareness and offer training, screening and reduced cost treatment, where applicable. In 2023, the programme launched in eight of 10 planned grant countries, in addition to the existing nine countries of operation.\n\n## Young Health Programme\n\nThe multi award-winning Young Health Programme (YHP) aims to empower young people to make more informed choices about their health and catalyse a global, youth-led advocacy movement, supported by community programmes and research. It helps to develop young leaders and is focused on vulnerable and under-resourced communities in 40 countries. Through partnerships with more than 60 non-profit partners around the world including UNICEF, the YHP promotes health literacy and policy action. In 2023, the YHP won the Better Society Award for Partnership with an International Charity together with UNICEF.\n\n## Community investment\n\nCommunity investment at AstraZeneca is built upon the principles of equity, transparency and partnership, working together to build healthy and resilient communities. In 2023, we contributed $115.4 million in financial and non-financial donations, (including product donations), to more than 810 non-profit partners across 76 countries. We also donated $4.7 billion (2022: $3.1 billion) of medicines through patient assistance programmes around the world, the largest of which is our AZ&Me Prescription Savings Program in the US.\n\n## Product donation programmes\n\nIn 2023, we gave $7.5 million (2022: $12.1 million) in product donations for disaster, humanitarian relief and public health need. We are committed to working with all health system stakeholders to enable the supply of medicine to patients and to support the resilience and recovery of healthcare facilities in vulnerable communities.\n\nFor more information, see:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPricing and value of our medicines on page 39.\n\nRare Disease from page 28.\n\nQure.ai case study on page 19.",

Science-led climate action and investments in nature and biodiversity are vital to improving health outcomes and proactively managing our environmental impact.\n\nThrough our Natural Resource Efficiency Fund, we have invested approximately $175 million in environmental efficiency innovations since 2015. This, together with other central capital investments, has seen a further $36.6 million spent in 2023, including 72 new projects.\n\n## Achievements in 2023\n\n- > 67.6% reduction in Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions since 2015.\n- > 17.5% reduction in energy consumption since 2015.\n- > 19.9 million trees planted by AZ Forest since 2020.\n- > 19.5% reduction in water usage and 13.2% reduction in our waste since 2015.\n- > 99% safe API discharges for AstraZeneca sites and 94% safe API discharges for globally managed first-tier supplier sites.\n- > 97.6% of paper-based product packaging materials used in 2022 (data collated in 2023) confirmed as supplied from sustainable sources.\n\n## Ambition Zero Carbon\n\nApproximately 5% of global GHG emissions come from the healthcare sector. We are accelerating the delivery of net-zero healthcare and our own progress towards net zero, as one of the first companies to have our Scope 1, 2 and 3 targets verified under the Science-Based Targets initiative Net-Zero Corporate Standard.\n\nNear-term targets:\n\n- > 98% absolute reduction in Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 2026 from 2015 baseline, maximising transition to electric vehicles in our road fleet (EV100) by end of 2025 and using 100% renewable energy (RE100) for electricity and heat by end of 2025.\n- > Reduce energy consumption by 10% and double energy productivity (EP100) from 2015 to 2025.\n- > Launch first next-generation respiratory inhalers with near-zero climate impact propellant from 2025.\n- > 95% of our suppliers by spend covering purchased goods and services and capital goods, and 50% of our suppliers by spend covering upstream transportation and distribution and business travel, will have science-based targets (SBTs) by 2025.\n\nLonger-term targets:\n\n- > 50% reduction in total Scope 3 GHG emissions by 2030 and 90% reduction by 2045, from 2019 baseline.\n- > Carbon negative for all residual emissions from 2030 and science-based net zero by 2045.\n- > Transition to next-generation respiratory inhalers with near-zero climate impact propellant across our portfolio by 2030.\n- > Plant and maintain 200 million trees by 2030, through our global AZ Forest initiative.\n\nOur goal of becoming carbon negative across our value chain from 2030 recognises that total emissions from value chain partners are significantly larger than from our own direct operations. We are embedding net-zero assessments into our existing and future product portfolios, engaging our suppliers to reduce their direct emissions through to 2030 and identifying carbon removal options.\n\n## Product sustainability\n\nPeople and the planet will benefit from those medicines that have the smallest possible environmental impact, yet maintain the highest efficacy and safety standards. As technologies and healthcare systems evolve, so should solutions to reduce the use of energy, water and material, as well as waste and pollution generated from designing, manufacturing and delivering medicines to patients. We are using a data-driven approach through our Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and Product Sustainability Index programmes to address the largest contributor to our Scope 3 emissions: our product value chains.\n\nIn 2023, we continued to focus on the next-generation propellant transition for pMDI products in our respiratory portfolio. The new propellant HFO-1234ze(E) has up to 99.9% lower GWP than propellants currently used in respiratory medicines. As essential, life-saving medicines for millions of respiratory patients globally, they are strategically important to our business and a key product-related element of Ambition Zero Carbon. In 2023, project milestones achieved included further Phase III investment decisions, a harmonised, global development programme, readouts of pivotal studies and initiation of key registration studies.\n\nAs part of our commitment to drive thought leadership and innovation to manage pharmaceuticals in the environment, we lead the Innovative Health Initiative PREMIER project, a partnership between the European Commission and the EFPIA. We are developing tools to identify potential environmental risks of APIs and make data more accessible to all stakeholders. In 2023, PREMIER published an evidence-led prioritisation of environmental data generation, aiming to reduce reliance on fish studies.\n\n## Natural resources\n\nThe conservation and sustainable use of natural resources and the protection and restoration of ecosystems are vital for a healthy future and to tackle the environmental drivers of disease. We are investing in nature to benefit planetary and societal health, while working towards sustainable resource use, water security and halting and reversing biodiversity loss.\n\nOur targets aim to decouple water use and waste generation from business growth and to minimise environmental impacts from our supply chain and operations, supported by efficiency projects, collaboration with suppliers on responsible sourcing, designing out waste and pollution, and landscape restoration targets via AZ Forest.\n\n## Circular economy\n\nAdopting circular business approaches and implementing efficient processes to develop and produce our medicines are key to reducing natural resources used in our value chains. We are leveraging our experience with Lean manufacturing and embedding best practices, working with organisations such as My Green Lab. In 2023, we introduced a new internal Site Waste Circularity Rate metric to drive improvements through increased recycling and the external reuse or repurposing of waste materials across all our sites.\n\n## Water stewardship\n\nWe continue to work with key stakeholders, including our ongoing collaboration with the World Wide Fund for Nature Sweden. Starting in 2024, we will invest $5 million per year to fund nature restoration and water stewardship projects in the communities where we operate.\n\n## AZ Forest\n\nIn 2023, we announced an increase in our investment to $400 million in our global AZ Forest programme, to plant 200 million trees by 2030 and ensure their long-term survival. This includes new or expanded projects in Brazil, India, Vietnam, Ghana, Rwanda and Kenya, which will contribute to our climate action, promote the restoration of biodiversity and natural habitats, and build community resilience. The programme is expected to restore more than 100,000 hectares worldwide, positively impacting an estimated 80,000 livelihoods and local communities. We are led by guiding principles that provide a baseline for project design and a consistent approach that follows the science. We do not purchase land for reforestation or own the trees, but have the rights to carbon certificates generated by some projects. In 2023, we planted over nine million trees using locally-appropriate species.",

We promote ethical, transparent and inclusive policies internally as well as with our partners and suppliers. It is important that we create value beyond the impact our medicines have on patients. We need to ensure that we retain and increase trust across all our stakeholder groups in order to continue delivering life-changing medicines to patients.\n\n## Achievements in 2023\n\n- > 50.1% of senior middle management roles are held by women.\n- > We have 10 countries with supplier diversity programmes outside the US.\n- > 83% of employee survey respondents feel they can speak their mind at work.\n\n## Code of Ethics\n\nWe are committed to high ethical standards. Our Code of Ethics (the Code) embodies our Values, expected behaviours, principles and policies. It applies to all Executive and Non-Executive Directors, officers, employees and contract staff of our worldwide Group. The Code empowers employees to make decisions in the best interests of the Group, the communities in which we work and the people we serve. It focuses on why our commitments matter and is at the core of our Compliance Programme. It has been translated into approximately 40 languages and guides employees on how to make the best choices and act in a consistent, responsible way. Our mandatory training reminds employees of our commitments. In 2023, 100% of active employees completed annual training on the Code.\n\nFor more information, see:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur Sustainability Report on www.astrazeneca.com/ sustainability/resources.html.\n\nOur Code, Global Policies and Position Statements on our website, www.astrazeneca.com/ sustainability/resources.html.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nChampions of inclusion and diversity, and Workforce safety and health, on page 45.\n\nMy Green Lab case study on page 37.\n\nThe Code includes high-level Global Policies complemented by Global Standards. We also have additional global, local and functional requirements to support employees in their daily work.\n\nThe Code asks employees to report possible violations and provides information on how to do so, including via the AZ Ethics helpline or website. AZ Ethics is also available to third parties. Reports can be made anonymously where desired and permitted by local law. Anyone who raises a potential breach in good faith is fully supported by management; retaliation is not tolerated.\n\nThe majority of cases come to our attention through self-reporting to line managers or local Human Resources, Legal or Compliance. In 2023, 470 reports of alleged compliance breaches or other ethical concerns were made through AZ Ethics, including anonymous reports that could be considered whistleblowing (2022: 490).\n\nA Finance Code complements the Code and applies to the CFO, the Group's principal accounting officers (including key finance staff in all overseas subsidiaries) and all managers in the Finance function. This reinforces the importance of the integrity of the Group's Financial Statements, the reliability of the accounting records on which they are based, and the robustness of the relevant controls and processes.\n\n## Non-Financial and Sustainability Information Statement\n\nUnder sections 414CA and 414CB of the Companies Act 2006, as introduced by the Companies, Partnerships and Groups (Accounts and Non-Financial Reporting) Regulations 2016, and amended by The Companies (Strategic Report) (Climaterelated Financial Disclosure) Regulations 2022, AstraZeneca is required to include, in its Strategic Report, a non-financial and sustainability statement containing certain information. As required by these sections, the Strategic Report contains our Climate-related Financial Disclosures (as defined in section 414CB(2A) - see pages 51 to 53), as well as information on the following matters, which include references to our relevant policies, due diligence processes and information on how we are performing against various measures in these areas:\n\n- > Anti-bribery and anti-corruption, see page 39\n- > Code of Ethics, see page 49\n- > Access to healthcare, see page 47\n- > Environmental protection, see page 48\n- > People, see page 44\n- > Human rights, see page 45.\n\nIn relation to the areas listed above, information on the Group's Principal Risks is included in Risk Overview (see from page 54) and information on the non-financial key performance indicators relevant to our business is included in Key Performance Indicators (see from page 12). A description of our business model is contained in Business Model and Life-cycle of a medicine (see from page 10).\n\n## Ethical use of AI\n\nOur Enterprise AI Governance team aims to ensure that AstraZeneca can maximise the benefits of AI technologies in a safe, responsible and ethical way.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The EU Taxonomy (Taxonomy) is a classification system for sustainable economic activities. An economic activity is Taxonomy-eligible if it is described in the Taxonomy Delegated Acts. An economic activity is Taxonomy-aligned if it makes a substantial contribution to one or more of the specified environmental objectives, meets specified Do-NoSignificant-Harm criteria, and is carried out in compliance with specified minimum social safeguards. In 2023, the EU adopted the new Environmental Delegated Act, which includes pharmaceutical activities.\n\nInformation prepared under this disclosure is consistent with our Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2023, and comparatives, prepared under the basis of preparation detailed in our Group Accounting Policies on page 152.\n\nCapital expenditure (Capex) was assessed for Taxonomy-eligibility on a project basis. Operating expenditures (Opex) were assessed for Taxonomy-eligibility based on the nature of expense. Taxonomy-alignment assessments were conducted on an activity level, based on our Global Standards and Policies. No activity was assessed as fully Taxonomy-aligned in 2023. Double-counting was avoided by reconciliation to underlying financial records.\n\nInterpretation of the EU Taxonomy is required and company-specific assumptions are required to fulfil the reporting requirements. Since no activity was assessed as fully\n\nTaxonomy-aligned, we have set out our required disclosures in a simplified format below as the prescribed table formats relating to alignment disclosures are not applicable.\n\n## Revenue\n\nThe Taxonomy-eligible Revenue KPI is defined as Taxonomy-eligible Revenue divided by Total Revenue, which corresponds to 'Total Revenue' in our Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income as detailed on page 148.\n\nThe Group's revenues are wholly derived from the business of pharmaceuticals, which we accordingly consider in total for Taxonomyeligibility under the activity 'Manufacture of medicinal products'. Consequently, our Taxonomy-eligible Revenue KPI for the year ended 31 December 2023 is 100% (2022: 0%). Last year, our business activity of pharmaceuticals was not covered by the EU Taxonomy.\n\n## Capital expenditure\n\nThe Taxonomy-eligible Capex KPI is defined as Taxonomy-eligible Capex divided by Total Capex.\n\n- > Taxonomy-eligible Capex is capex related to assets or processes associated with Taxonomy-eligible activities. Purchase of intellectual property, marketing and distribution rights over medicinal products is considered in total for Taxonomyeligibility under the activity 'Manufacture of medicinal products'.\n- > Total Capex corresponds to the total of the 'Additions through business combinations' and 'Capital expenditure' movement types\n\nas detailed in Note 7 - Property, plant and equipment (page 169), the total of the 'Additions - separately acquired' and 'Additions through business combinations' movement types as detailed in Note 8 Leases Right-of-use assets (page 170), and the total of the 'Additions - separately acquired' and 'Additions through business combinations' movement types as detailed in Note 10 - Intangible assets (page 172).\n\nThe Group's Taxonomy-eligible Capex KPI for the year ended 31 December 2023 is 83% (2022: 14%).\n\n## Operating expenditure\n\nThe Taxonomy-eligible Opex KPI is defined as Taxonomy-eligible Opex divided by Taxonomy-defined Opex.\n\n- > The Group's Taxonomy-eligible Opex is expenses related to assets or processes associated with Taxonomy-eligible economic activities. R&D expenses are considered in total for Taxonomy-eligibility under the activity 'Manufacture of medicinal products'.\n- > The Group's Taxonomy-defined Opex is the total of R&D expenses, and other direct non-capitalised costs that relate to building renovation measures, short-term leases, maintenance and repair, and any other direct expenditures incurred in the day-to-day servicing of assets of Property, plant and equipment.\n\nThe Group's Taxonomy-eligible Opex KPI for the year ended 31 December 2023 is 99% (2022: 2%).\n\n## Taxonomy eligibility and alignment\n\n|                                                                            | Revenue                     | Revenue                     | Revenue                     | Revenue                     | Capex   | Capex   | Capex   | Capex   | Opex   | Opex   | Opex   | Opex   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n|                                                                            | 2023                        | 2023                        | 2022                        | 2022                        | 2023    | 2023    | 2022    | 2022    | 2023   | 2023   | 2022   | 2022   |\n|                                                                            | $m                          | %                           | $m                          | %                           | $m      | %       | $m      | %       | $m     | %      | $m     | %      |\n| Taxonomy-aligned activities                                                | Taxonomy-aligned activities | Taxonomy-aligned activities | Taxonomy-aligned activities | Taxonomy-aligned activities |         |         |         |         |        |        |        |        |\n| No activities were assessed as  Taxonomy-aligned                           |                             |                             |                             |                             |         |         |         |         |        |        |        |        |\n| Taxonomy-eligible but not Taxonomy- aligned                                |                             |                             |                             |                             |         |         |         |         |        |        |        |        |\n| 1.2 Manufacture of medicinal products                                      | 45,811                      | 100                         | n/a                         | n/a                         |         | 65      |         | n/a     |        | 96     |        | n/a    |\n| 6.5 Transport by motorbikes, passenger  cars and light commercial vehicles |                             |                             |                             |                             |         | 4       |         | 2       |        | -      |        | -      |\n| 7.1 Construction of new buildings                                          |                             |                             |                             |                             |         | 6       |         | 8       |        | -      |        | -      |\n| 7.2 Renovation of existing buildings                                       |                             |                             |                             |                             | 4,918   | 2       | 3,519   | 2       | 11,380 | -      | 10,076 | -      |\n| 7.7 Acquisition and ownership of  buildings                                |                             |                             |                             |                             |         | 5       |         | -       |        | 3      |        | 2      |\n| 8.1 Data processing, hosting and  related activities                       |                             |                             |                             |                             |         | 1       |         | 1       |        | -      |        | -      |\n| 8.2 Computer programming,  consultancy and related activities              |                             |                             |                             |                             |         | -       |         | 1       |        | -      |        | -      |",

These risks are defined by the cost of interruption and strategic importance, and our assessment includes climate changerelated hazards arising under three different scenarios by 2030, 2050 and 2100, including a worst-case scenario (SSP5-RCP 8.5). We prioritised screening results according to business criticality, to identify material sites for deep dive assessments during 2021 and 2023. We also continued to engage with strategic partners with a critical role in patient supply to understand their exposure to climate-related hazards and their resilience to climate change.\n\nFor medicines, transition risks and opportunities are screened by using LCA and carbon intensity data. In 2023, we have continued to focus on pMDIs in our respiratory portfolio due to their relative high carbon intensity. We aim to launch our first nextgeneration pMDI from 2025 and complete the transition to a near-zero Global Warming Potential (GWP) propellant across our portfolio by 2030, as part of our Ambition Zero Carbon strategy to accelerate business decarbonisation while ensuring people can access essential medicines.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMitigation measures are often already in place to address climate-related risks and opportunities, including transition to a low-carbon economy and net-zero healthcare provision. Physical and transitional climaterelated risks are included within a specific risk in the Group's risk landscape 'Failure to meet regulatory or ethical expectations on environmental impact, including climate change'.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| For more information, see: Our 2023 TCFD Statement on our  website, www.astrazeneca.com/                                                             |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| annualreport2023.                                                                                                                                    |\n| Our CDP response, based on  2023 performance on our  approach to climate change, on  www.cdp.net/en.                                                 |\n| Our Sustainability Report: which  describes our overall approach  and progress, on our website,  www.astrazeneca.com/ sustainability/resources.html. |\n| The Risk Supplement on  our website,   www.astrazeneca.com/ annualreport2023.                                                                        |\n| Our strategy and GHG emissions  reduction targets and progress,  from page 12, and on pages 43  and 48.                                              |",

        "page_content": "## Risk Overview\n\n'Our Principal Risks are those risks that are most likely to have a material impact on our business.'\n\n## Managing risk\n\nOur approach to risk management is designed to encourage clear decision making on which risks we take and how we manage these risks. We strive to embed sound risk management in our strategy, planning, budgeting and performance management processes. The Board defines the Group's risk appetite. This enables the Group, in both quantitative and qualitative terms, to judge the level of risk it is prepared to take in achieving its overall objectives. The Board expresses the acceptable levels of risk for the Group using three key dimensions. These are: (i) earnings and cash flow, (ii) return on investment and (iii) ethics and reputation. Annually, the Group develops a detailed three-year bottom-up business plan and 10-year long-range projection to support the delivery of its strategy. The Board considers these in the context of the Group's risk appetite. Adjustments are made to the plan or risk appetite to ensure they remain aligned.\n\nThe SET is required by the Board to oversee and monitor the effectiveness of the risk management processes implemented by management. Within each SET function, leadership teams discuss the risks the business faces. Quarterly, each SET function assesses changes to these risks, new and emerging risks and mitigation plans. These are assimilated into a Group Risk Report for the Board, Audit Committee and SET.\n\nGlobal Compliance, Finance and Global Internal Audit support the SET by advising on policy and standard setting, monitoring and auditing, communication and training, as well as reporting on the adequacy of line management processes as they apply to risk management. The Board believes that existing processes provide it with adequate information on the risks and uncertainties we face. The Board has carried out a robust assessment of the Principal and emerging risks facing the Group. Our Principal Risks are those risks that are most likely to have a material impact on our business and are a subset of the total risk landscape facing the Group. The table on pages 56 and 57 provides insight into these Principal Risks.\n\n## Emerging risks\n\nEmerging risks are 'new' risks that have the potential to crystallise in the future but are unlikely to impact the business during the next year. The outcome of such risks is often more uncertain. They may begin to evolve rapidly or simply not materialise.\n\nWe monitor our business activities and external and internal environments for new, emerging and changing risks to ensure these are managed appropriately. Annually, we combine input from each SET function and external insight to scan the horizon for emerging risks and a summary is presented to the Audit Committee and Board. Emerging risks continue to be monitored as part of the ongoing risk management processes outlined above.\n\n## Climate risk\n\nThe identification and assessment of climate risk form part of our existing risk management processes. 'Failure to meet regulatory and ethical expectations on environmental impact, including climate change' is a component of the Group's risk landscape but is not currently considered to be a Principal Risk for the Group.\n\nWe support the TCFD framework and continue to develop our disclosures in line with its recommendations. Our TCFD Summary Statement from page 51 summarises the work undertaken to date to understand the potential impact of climate change on our business and outlines future areas of management focus.\n\n## Cybersecurity risk\n\nOur approach to identifying, assessing and managing material cybersecurity risks (including those that result from the use of third parties in business processes and data management) is integrated within our Group-wide approach to managing risk. Failure in information technology or cybersecurity has been identified as a Principal Risk. Mitigations are in place to manage these risks, and these are monitored, and their effectiveness regularly reported, for example, in KPI dashboards provided to management and the Audit Committee. Incidents are managed and reported using the cybersecurity incident management framework which in turn is connected to the Group's crisis management framework. Cybersecurity risks are overseen by the Audit Committee, which performs an in-depth review annually. Its reviews are supported by senior management, the VP, Group Internal Audit and other assurance or providers as required. Cybersecurity risks (including previous incidents) have not materially affected our business strategy, results of operations or financial condition.",

        "page_content": "## Viability statement\n\nIn accordance with provision 31 of the 2018 UK Corporate Governance Code, the Board has determined that a three-year period to 31 December 2026 constitutes an appropriate period over which to provide its viability statement.\n\nThe Board assesses the Company's prospects using a 10-year long-range projection. It notes the rich and varied portfolio of medicines in development across a range of therapy areas and the medicines currently commercialised in more than 100 markets and concludes that the Company's long-term prospects remain strong. The Board also considers annually and on a rolling basis, a three-year bottomup detailed business plan and, given the inherent uncertainty involved, believes that the three-year statement presents readers of this Annual Report with a reasonable degree of assurance over the ongoing viability of the Company while still providing a longer-term perspective.\n\nThe three-year detailed business plan captures risks to the sales and cost forecasts at a market and SET function level. The plan is used to perform central net debt and headroom profile analysis. The following scenarios have been applied to this analysis to create a severe but plausible downside combining a number of the Principal Risks detailed from pages 56 to 57.\n\n- > Principal Risks : Pricing, affordability, access and competitive pressures; failures or delays in the quality or execution of the Group's commercial strategies.\n- -Scenario 1 - Government action on pricing, higher than anticipated competition and other commercial headwinds result in lower than anticipated growth rates for our medicines.\n- -Scenario 2 - A significant incident leads to reputational damage in a key market resulting in an ongoing 10% reduction in revenue achieved in this market.\n\n- > Principal Risk : Failure or delay in the delivery of our pipeline or launch of new medicines.\n- -Scenario 3 - Assumes no launches of new products.\n- > Principal Risk: Failure to maintain supply of compliant, quality medicines.\n- -Scenario 4 - Major equipment failure or significant regulatory observation at one of our major manufacturing sites results in a 12-month loss of formulation capability for one of our key oncology products leading to supply interruption.\n- > Principal Risks : Failure in information technology or cybersecurity; adverse outcome of litigation and/or government investigations.\n- -Scenario 5 - Legal, regulatory, cyber or other non-compliance results in a payment of $500 million in 2025.\n\nIn addition, the Board has considered more stressed scenarios, including restrictions on debt factoring and no access to capital markets to raise new debt. In each scenario (or combination of scenarios above), the Group is able to rely on its existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term fixed income investments, committed credit facilities, leveraging its cost base, reducing capital expenditure and taking other cash management measures to mitigate the impacts and still have residual capacity to absorb further shocks.\n\nBased on the results of this analysis, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities, as they fall due, over the three-year period of their assessment.\n\n' We monitor our business activities and external and internal environments for new, emerging and changing risks to ensure these are managed appropriately.'\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFull details are given in the Risk Supplement on our website, www.astrazeneca.com/ annualreport2023.",

We started the year with several operational uncertainties, including revenues from our COVID-19 mAbs and certain other products. Despite some of these risks materialising, the vast majority of the portfolio outperformed expectation, leading to an exceptional year. This speaks to the strength of our diversified portfolio and geographic footprint. Our R&D teams are progressing novel medicines and we continue to enhance our portfolio though business development and mergers and acquisitions. At the same time, we continue to optimise 'how work is done', expanding services offered in our shared business Centres of Excellence. Our colleagues across functions remain focused on quality, reporting, controls, cybersecurity, and supply, while incorporating a mindset of continuous improvement.\n\n## Total Revenue growth\n\nAstraZeneca achieved Total Revenue of $45.8 billion in 2023, including $1.4 billion of Alliance Revenue and $0.6 billion of Collaboration Revenue with growth of 3% (CER: 6%). 2023 delivered 13 blockbuster medicines in total. Excluding COVID-19 medicines, Total Revenue increased by 13% (CER: 15%) in the year.\n\n' AstraZeneca achieved Total  Revenue of $45.8 billion in 2023,  with growth of 3% (CER: 6%),  including $1.4 billion of Alliance  Revenue and $0.6 billion of  Collaboration Revenue.  Excluding COVID-19 medicines,  Total Revenue increased by 13%  (CER: 15%).'\n\nProduct Sales grew by 2% (CER: 4%) to $43.8 billion, with 12 blockbuster medicines, including Ultomiris , Soliris and Strensiq from our Rare Disease portfolio. Our continued investment in Oncology and CVRM medicine launches supported sustained Product Sales growth, with Oncology achieving 17% (CER: 20%) and CVRM achieving 15% (CER: 18%). Standout performances came once again from Farxiga ($6.0 billion), Tagrisso ($5.8 billion) and Imfinzi ($4.2 billion). Within our Rare Disease portfolio, Soliris achieved Product Sales of $3.1 billion but saw a decline of 16% (CER: 14%) due to the successful conversion to Ultomiris , which had growth of 51% (CER: 52%) to $3.0 billion in the year. In the US, we had overall growth of 4%, with Product Sales of $18.0 billion. In Emerging Markets, Product Sales grew by 1% (CER: 8%) to $11.8 billion, with growth in CVRM and Tagrisso . In Europe, Product Sales increased by 9% (CER: 7%) to $9.0 billion, reflecting strong performances from Oncology and Forxiga and in Established Rest of World markets, there was a decline of 14% (CER: 8%) to $5.0 billion due to mandatory pricing reductions of Tagrisso in Japan and the drop off in demand for COVID-19 medicines.\n\nAlliance Revenue increased by 89% (CER: 89%) to $1.4 billion, including $1.0 billion from Enhertu , which achieved blockbuster status for the first time. Collaboration Revenue declined by 1% (CER: 1%) to $0.6 billion.\n\n## Profitability\n\nReported EPS was $3.84 in the year (2022: $2.12) and Core EPS was $7.26 (2022: $6.66) driven by improved Product Sales Gross Margin from Total Revenue growth and a decline in sales of lower margin COVID-19 medicines.\n\n## Key milestones/approvals\n\nOur continued investment in the pipeline yielded several significant approvals and milestones in the year, including regulatory approval in the US for Truqap in breast cancer, Wainua (eplontersen) in transthyretinmediated amyloid polyneuropathy and Beyfortus for the prevention of RSV in infants. In Japan, in January 2024, Voydeya was approved for the treatment of anaemia due to extravascular haemolysis.\n\n2023 also afforded me the opportunity to engage with a number of our stakeholders from investors to key opinion leaders and physicians at congresses, and from employees to government officials. This brought to light how special a place AstraZeneca truly is. Our stakeholders see AstraZeneca as a company on the forefront of science with a broad ambition to continuously improve health, our communities and our planet. During all my interactions, I have been impressed with the engagement, energy and passion of my colleagues and humbled by the privilege of working with an amazing set of people. 2024 will bring more change and we will continue to evolve while remaining true to our Values.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAradhana Sarin\n\nChief Financial Officer",

Our operating results can be affected by a number of factors other than the delivery of operating plans and normal competition.\n\nOver the longer term, the success of our R&D is crucial and we devote substantial resources to this area. The benefits of this investment are expected to emerge over the long term and there is considerable inherent uncertainty as to the scale and timing of outcomes and their transition to saleable products.\n\n## Measuring performance\n\nReported and Core performance are referred to in this Financial Review when reporting on our performance in absolute terms, but more often in comparison with earlier years:\n\n- > Reported performance takes into account all the factors (including those which we cannot influence, such as currency exchange rates) that have affected the results of our business. The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with UK-adopted IAS and with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 as applicable to companies reporting under those standards. The Consolidated Financial Statements also comply fully with IFRS Accounting Standards as issued by the IASB and IAS as adopted by the EU.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFurther details of the risks faced  by the business are given in  Risk Overview from page 54 and  in the Risk Supplement at  www.astrazeneca.com/ annualreport2023.\n\n   For a detailed definition of \n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCore measures, see page 61. \n\n \n\n  Readers should also refer to our  Reported financial information in  the Summary performance in  2023 table on page 59, our  reconciliation of Core  performance measures to  Reported financial information in  the 2023 Reconciliation of  Reported results to Core results  table and the Excluded from Core  results table on page 63, for our  discussion of comparative  growth measures that reflect all  factors that affect our business.\n\n- > Core performance measures are adjusted to exclude certain significant items, using a set of established principles.\n\n## Use of non-GAAP performance measures\n\nCore performance measures, EBITDA, Net debt, CER, Product Sales Gross Margin (formerly termed Gross Margin) and Operating Margin are non-GAAP performance measures because they cannot be derived directly from the Financial Statements.\n\nBy disclosing non-GAAP performance and growth measures, in addition to our Reported financial information, we are enhancing investors' ability to evaluate and analyse the financial performance and trends of our ongoing business and the related key business drivers. The adjustments are made to our Reported financial information in order to show non-GAAP performance measures that illustrate clearly the impact on our performance of factors such as changes in revenues and expenses driven by volume, prices and cost levels relative to such prior years or periods. These non-GAAP performance measures are not a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.\n\nAs shown in the 2023 Reconciliation of Reported results to Core results table on page 62, our reconciliation of Reported financial information to Core performance measures includes a breakdown of the items for which our Reported financial information is adjusted, and a further breakdown by specific line item as such items are reflected in our Reported income statement. This illustrates the significant items that are excluded from Core performance measures and their impact on our Reported financial information, both as a whole and in respect of specific line items.\n\nManagement presents these results externally to meet investors' requirements for transparency and clarity. Core financial measures are also used internally in the management of our business performance, in our budgeting process and when determining compensation. As a result, Core performance measures allow investors to differentiate between different kinds of costs but they should not be used in isolation.\n\nOur determination of non-GAAP measures, and our presentation of them within this Financial Review, may differ from similarly titled non-GAAP measures of other companies.\n\nThe SET retains strategic management of the costs excluded from Reported financial information in arriving at Core financial measures, tracking their impact on Reported Operating profit and EPS, with operational management being delegated on a case-bycase basis to ensure clear accountability and consistency for each cost category.\n\nWe strongly encourage readers of this Annual Report not to rely on any single financial measure but to review our Financial Statements, including the Notes thereto, and our other publicly filed reports, carefully and in their entirety.",

Revenues and cost growth expressed in CER allow management to understand the true local movement in revenues and costs, in order to compare recent trends and relative return on investment. CER growth rates can be used to analyse revenues in a number of ways but, most often, we consider CER growth by products and groups of products, and by countries and regions.\n\nCore performance measures are adjusted to exclude certain significant items. In determining the adjustments to arrive at the Core result, we use a set of established principles relating to the nature or materiality of individual items or groups of items, excluding, for example, events which are (i) outside the normal course of business, (ii) incurred in a pattern that is unrelated to the trends in the underlying financial performance of our ongoing business, or (iii) related to major acquisitions, to ensure that investors' ability to evaluate and analyse the underlying financial performance of our ongoing business is enhanced.\n\nOur Core adjustments are summarised as:\n\nRestructuring costs, including charges that relate to the impact of our global restructuring programmes on our capitalised manufacturing facilities and IT assets. These can take place over multiple reporting periods, given the long life-cycle of our business.\n\nWhy we use them: We adjust for these charges and provisions because they primarily reflect the financial impact of change to legacy arrangements, rather than the underlying performance of our ongoing business.\n\nIntangible amortisation and impairments, including impairment reversals but excluding any charges relating to IT assets. Intangibles generally arise from business combinations and individual licence acquisitions.\n\nWhy we use them: We adjust for these charges because their pattern of recognition is largely uncorrelated with the underlying performance of the business.\n\nDefinition: Product Sales Gross Margin (formerly termed Gross Margin) is the percentage by which Product Sales exceeds the Cost of sales, calculated by dividing the difference between the two by the sales figure. The calculation of Reported and Core Product Sales Gross Margin excludes the impact of Alliance Revenue and Collaboration Revenue and any associated costs, thereby reflecting the underlying performance of Product Sales.\n\nCER revenue growth can be further analysed by revenue volumes and selling price. Similarly, CER cost growth helps us to focus on the real local change in costs so that we can manage the cost base effectively.\n\nLimitations: CER measures are not always better indicators of performance. Where countries are subject to high inflation and currencies that depreciate persistently, adjusting out the effect of foreign exchange fluctuations could give an overly optimistic view of growth.\n\nAlexion acquisition-related items, primarily fair value adjustments on acquired inventories and fair value impact of replacement employee share awards.\n\nWhy we use them: We adjust for this item to enable a more meaningful comparison of the performance of acquired business and products to that of internally developed products, as well as removing charges whose pattern of recognition is largely uncorrelated to the underlying performance of the business.\n\nOther specified items, principally the imputed finance charges and fair value movements relating to contingent consideration on business combinations, imputed finance charges and remeasurement adjustments on certain Other payables arising from intangible asset acquisitions, legal settlements and remeasurement adjustments relating to Other payables assumed from the Alexion acquisition.\n\nWhy we use them: We adjust for these items to enable a more meaningful comparison of the performance of acquired businesses and products to that of internally developed products, as well as removing charges whose pattern of recognition is largely uncorrelated to the underlying performance of the business.\n\nIt should be noted that some costs excluded from our Core results, such as intangibles amortisation and finance charges related to contingent consideration, will recur in future years, and other excluded items such as impairments and legal settlements costs, along with other acquisition-related costs, may recur in the future.\n\nLimitations: Core results exclude significant costs (such as restructuring, intangible amortisation and impairments, and other acquisition-related adjustments), but incorporate associated benefits, including Product Sales arising from business combinations, asset acquisitions and assets which have been amortised, as well as the benefits resulting from restructuring activities and, as such, they should not be regarded as a complete picture of the Group's financial performance, which is presented in its Reported results. The exclusion of the adjusting items may result in Core earnings being materially higher or lower than Reported earnings.\n\nWhy we use it: This measure sets out gross profitability of Product Sales when taking account of only direct Cost of sales. It is a key performance measure of the contribution to fund operating costs and overall quality of the business.\n\nLimitations: Product Sales Gross Margin percentage excludes the impact of Alliance Revenue and Collaboration Revenue and related costs and therefore should not be regarded as giving a full picture of Total Revenue performance.",

Product Sales in Emerging Markets grew by 1% (CER: 8%) to $11,751 million in 2023 with growth in CVRM, Respiratory & Immunology and Tagrisso . Product Sales in ex-China Emerging Markets remained broadly flat (CER: growth of 8%) at $5,884 million, with increases in Oncology and Farxiga offset by declines in COVID-19 medicines. In Europe, Product Sales grew by 9% (CER: 7%) to $9,029 million, reflecting a strong performance in Oncology and Forxiga but also reflecting COVID-19 medicines decline. Established Rest of World Product Sales decreased by 14% (CER: 8%) to $5,048 million, with sales in Japan down 9% (CER: 1%) to $3,654 million, driven by decline in COVID-19 medicines partially offset by increases in Oncology.\n\n## By Product\n\n2023 succeeded in delivering 12 blockbuster drugs.\n\nOur largest selling products in the year were Farxiga ($5,963 million), Tagrisso ($5,799 million), Imfinzi ($4,237 million), Soliris ($3,145 million), and Ultomiris ($2,965 million). Farxiga sales increased by 36% (CER: 39%), with continued volume growth across all major regions driven by launches in HF and CKD. Tagrisso sales grew by 7% (CER: 9%) reflecting a strong performance from increased demand across all markets. Imfinzi Product Sales grew by 52% (CER: 55%), with increased use worldwide driven by new launches and established indications. Soliris declined by 16% (CER: 14%) due to the successful conversion to Ultomiris , which increased by 51% (CER: 52%).\n\nCalquence continued its growth with an increase of 22% (CER: 23%) in the year to $2,514 million driven by increased market penetration globally, including increased new patient starts in Europe and sustained US performance.\n\nWithin Vaccines & Immune Therapies, Product Sales declined by 79% (CER: 78%) due to fulfilment of contracts signed during the pandemic.",

In markets where Daiichi Sankyo is selling the product, AstraZeneca is entitled to receive a royalty (in Japan) or a share of costs and income (in other territories). Share of gross profits and royalty income from Daiichi Sankyo are recognised as Alliance Revenue. Enhertu launched in the US on 31 December 2019.\n\nAlliance Revenue in respect of this agreement has been recognised as follows:\n\n- > Prior to 2023, AstraZeneca recognised $806 million in respect of Alliance Revenue.\n- > In 2023, AstraZeneca recognised Alliance Revenue of $1,022 million leading to Enhertu achieving blockbuster status in the year.\n\n## Tezspire (Amgen)\n\nIn 2012, AstraZeneca entered into a collaboration agreement with Amgen to co-develop and co-commercialise five development stage programmes. Of these, only AMG 157 ( Tezspire tezepelumab) remains in the collaboration. A second active molecule (AZD8630) was added in 2021. Manufacturing will be undertaken by Amgen, while commercialisation activity will be undertaken either jointly, or by AstraZeneca or Amgen individually, dependent on the market and on the agreed terms.\n\nAstraZeneca will recognise 100% of the sales as principal in all markets other than the US, as well as 100% of the associated cost of sales. In markets other than the US, where AstraZeneca is recognising sales, the share of gross margin payable to Amgen will be shown as additional cost of sales. In the US, where Amgen is recognising sales, AstraZeneca will record its share of gross profit as Alliance Revenue.\n\nAlliance Revenue in respect of this agreement has been recognised as follows:\n\n- > Prior to 2023, AstraZeneca recognised $79 million in respect of Alliance Revenue.\n- > In 2023, AstraZeneca recognised Alliance Revenue of $259 million.\n\n## Beyfortus (Sanofi)\n\nIn March 2017, AstraZeneca entered into an alliance with Sanofi to develop and commercialise Beyfortus jointly. Under the terms of the global agreement, Sanofi made an upfront payment of \u20ac120 million and will pay up to \u20ac495 million upon achievement of certain development and sales-related milestones. All costs and profits are shared equally. The US element of this collaboration was subject to a participation agreement with Sobi, effective from January 2019 until April 2023, at which point there was an update to the contractual relationships between AstraZeneca, Sobi and Sanofi relating to the future sales of Beyfortus . Alliance Revenue recognises AstraZeneca's 50% share of gross profits on sales of Beyfortus in major markets outside the US.\n\nAlliance Revenue in respect of this agreement has been recognised as follows:\n\n- > In 2023, AstraZeneca recognised Alliance Revenue of $57 million.\n\n## Collaboration Revenue\n\nCollaboration Revenue decreased in the year by 1% (CER: 1%) to $594 million.\n\nDetails of our significant business development transactions which give rise to Collaboration Revenue are given below.\n\n## Lynparza / Koselugo (MSD)\n\nIn July 2017, the Group announced a global strategic oncology collaboration with MSD to co-develop and co-commercialise AstraZeneca's Lynparza for multiple cancer types. As part of the agreement, MSD will pay AstraZeneca up to $8.5 billion in total consideration, including $1.6 billion upfront, $750 million for certain licence options and up to $6.2 billion contingent upon successful achievement of future regulatory and sales milestones. Of the upfront payment of $1.6 billion, $1.0 billion was recognised as Collaboration Revenue on deal completion in 2017, with the remaining $0.6 billion deferred to the balance sheet, of which less than $0.1 billion remains for 2023. AstraZeneca records all Collaboration Revenue of Lynparza and Koselugo ; amounts due to MSD under the collaboration will be recorded under Cost of sales.\n\nCollaboration Revenue in respect of this agreement has been recognised as follows:\n\n- > Prior to 2023, AstraZeneca recognised Collaboration Revenue totalling $2,865 million, comprising $750 million resulting from the exercise of options, $1,400 million in respect of sales-related milestones and $715 million in respect of regulatory milestones.\n- > In 2023, AstraZeneca recognised Collaboration Revenue of $245 million in respect of regulatory milestones.",

Core Gross profit increased by 6% (CER: 9%) to $37,800 million. Reported Product Sales Gross Margin grew by 10 (CER: 10) percentage points to 81.1%. Core Product Sales Gross Margin grew by two (CER: two) percentage points to 81.7%. Both Reported and Core Product Sales Gross Margin reflected positive product mix effects from Rare Disease and Oncology medicines, negative product mix effects from rising contributions of products with share of gross profit arrangements, and negative geographic mix effects as Emerging Markets grew as a proportion of Total Revenue. Reported Gross Margin was impacted by the fair value adjustment to Alexion inventories. The fair value uplift unwind through Cost of sales in 2023 was $114 million (2022: $3,848 million).\n\n## Operating expenses\n\nReported Operating expenses increased by 7% (CER: 8%) in the year to $30,690 million. Core Operating expenses increased by 7% (CER: 9%) to $24,545 million.\n\nReported R&D expense increased by 12% (CER: 13%) to $10,935 million and Core R&D expense increased by 8% (CER: 9%) to $10,267 million. Both Reported and Core R&D expense were impacted by recent positive data readouts for several high priority medicines and increased investment in new platforms, technologies and capabilities. Reported R&D expense also includes intangible asset impairment charges of $417 million; an increase of $322 million from 2022, which includes $244 million related to the impairment of the ALXN1840 intangible asset, following the decision to discontinue this development programme in Wilson disease.\n\nReported SG&A expense increased by 4% (CER: 6%) to $19,216 million and Core SG&A expense increased by 7% (CER: 9%) to $13,739 million. Both Reported and Core SG&A expense increases were driven primarily by market development activities for launches. Reported SG&A expense was impacted by amortisation of intangible assets related to the Alexion acquisition and other acquisitions and collaborations. Reported SG&A expense was also impacted by a $510 million charge to provisions relating to a legal settlement with Bristol-Myers Squibb and Ono Pharmaceutical, and a $425 million charge to provisions for product liability litigations related to Nexium and Prilosec . The prior year Reported SG&A expense was impacted by a $775 million legal settlement with Chugai Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd.\n\n## Other operating income and expense\n\nReported Other operating income and expense in the year was up 161% (CER: 160%) to $1,340 million. Core Other operating income and expense in the year was up 186% (CER: 186%) to $1,279 million. For 2023, both Reported and Core Other operating income and expense were impacted by a gain of $712 million on replacement of the contractual relationship between AstraZeneca, Sobi and Sanofi with a royalty relationship between Sanofi and Sobi and income of $241 million on the disposal of the US rights to Pulmicort Flexhaler .\n\n2022 included royalties and disposal proceeds on small divestments including the divestment of rights to Plendil .\n\nIn accordance with our Collaboration Revenue definition in the Group Accounting Policies from page 152, proceeds from these divestments are recorded as Other operating income and expense and comprise the majority of Other operating income and expense for the year.\n\n## Operating profit\n\nReported Operating profit increased by 118% (CER: 134%) to $8,193 million in the year. The Reported Operating Margin increased by nine percentage points (CER: 10) to 17.9% of Total Revenue. Core Operating profit grew by 9% (CER: 14%) in the year to $14,534 million.\n\n## Net finance expense\n\nReported Net finance expense increased by 2% (CER: 1%) in the year to $1,282 million. Core Net finance expense increased by 1% (CER: decreased by 1%) in the year to $984 million. Reported Net finance expense was impacted by the discount unwind on acquisition-related liabilities. Core Net finance expense increased due to higher interest received on cash and short-term investments, broadly offset by higher rates on floating debt and bond issuances.\n\n## Profit before tax\n\nReported Profit before tax increased to $6,899 million (2022: $2,501 million). Core Profit before tax increased by 9% (CER: 15%) to $13,538 million. Pre-tax adjustments to arrive at Core Profit before tax amounted to $6,639 million in 2023 (2022: $9,870 million), comprising $6,341 million adjustments to Operating profit (2022: $9,593 million) and $298 million to Net finance expense (2022: $277 million).",

This was $1,428 million higher than the Reported tax charge for the year, which benefited from a net deferred tax credit of $1,507 million (2022: $2,428 million), relating to the aforementioned $828 million deferred tax credit on the intragroup purchase of certain intellectual property, intangible amortisation and impairments, and other deferred tax items, partially offset by updates to estimates of prior period tax liabilities following progress of reviews by tax authorities and administrative appeal processes, and the timing differences for cash tax payments. Additional information on these items is contained in Note 4 to the Financial Statements from page 164.\n\nWe pay corporate income taxes, customs duties, excise taxes, stamp duties, employment and many other business taxes in all jurisdictions in which we operate. We also collect and pay employee taxes and other indirect taxes such as value-added tax in these jurisdictions.\n\n## Total comprehensive income\n\nTotal comprehensive income increased by $4,279 million to a profit of $6,694 million in 2023. Other comprehensive income, net of tax was $733 million, an increase of $1,611 million. This income was primarily driven by foreign exchange arising on consolidation gains of $608 million (2022: losses of $1,446 million) and tax credits on items that will not be reclassified to profit or loss of $101 million\n\n(2022: charge of $216 million) offset by remeasurement of the defined benefit pension liability losses of $406 million (2022: gains of $1,118 million).\n\n## EPS\n\nReported EPS was $3.84 in the year (2022: $2.12). Core EPS was $7.26 (2022: $6.66).\n\n## Restructuring\n\n## Post Alexion Acquisition Group Review (PAAGR)\n\nIn conjunction with the acquisition of Alexion in 2021, the enlarged Group initiated a comprehensive review, aimed at integrating systems, structure and processes, optimising the global footprint and prioritising resource allocations and investments. These activities are expected to be substantially complete by the end of 2026, with a number of planned activities having commenced in late 2021 and during 2022 and 2023.\n\nDuring 2023, the Group identified all remaining activities and finalised the scope of the programme. These additional activities, alongside updated estimates of the existing planned activities, have resulted in an increase to the expected one-time restructuring costs of $0.6 billion, of which an insignificant amount are non-cash costs, and an increase in capital investments of $0.7 billion. This includes the commencement of work on the planned upgrade of the Group's Enterprise Resource Planning IT systems (Axial Project), which is expected to be substantially complete by the end of 2030, resulting in capital investments for software assets of $0.7 billion and one-time restructuring cash costs of $0.3 billion, over the full course of the project. Anticipated annual run-rate pre-tax benefits have increased by $0.5 billion, and are expected to be realised by the end of 2026. This excludes significant strategic and compliance-related benefits resulting from the Axial Project, as a result of transforming core enterprise-wide processes, harmonising systems architecture and enabling future digital capabilities.\n\nConsequently, the total programme activities are now anticipated to incur one-time restructuring costs of approximately $3.6 billion, of which approximately $2.5 billion are cash costs and $1.1 billion are non-cash costs, and capital investments of approximately $1.6 billion.\n\nRun-rate pre-tax benefits, before reinvestment, are now expected to be approximately $2.4 billion by the end of 2026. In line with established practice, restructuring costs will be excluded from our Core (non-GAAP) financial measures.\n\nDuring 2023, the Group has recorded restructuring charges of approximately $0.4 billion in relation to the PAAGR (2022: $0.7 billion), bringing the cumulative charges to date under this programme to $2.1 billion. Of these costs, $0.7 billion are non-cash costs arising primarily from impairments and accelerated depreciation on affected assets.\n\nAs at 31 December 2023, the PAAGR has realised annual run-rate pre-tax benefits, before reinvestment, of $1.3 billion.\n\n## Other programmes\n\nThe Global Post Pandemic New Ways of Working programme that was initiated in 2020 in response to the changing business environment, accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic, is now substantially complete and has delivered changes that reflect the increasing utilisation of digitisation and technology, as well as the new ways of working that reflect the size, nature and footprint of commercial teams, enabling functions, R&D and operations. Costs incurred in 2023 and 2022 were insignificant.\n\nLegacy programmes include: the 2016 plan to redeploy investment to key disease areas, particularly Oncology; the centralisation of our global R&D footprint into three strategic centres; transformation of the IT organisation and closure of a number of manufacturing facilities; and the transformation of SG&A functions (principally Finance and HR). Net costs for legacy programmes in 2023 were $92 million (2022: $45 million).\n\nThe aggregate restructuring charge incurred in 2023 across all our restructuring programmes was $467 million (2022: $717 million). Final estimates for programme costs, benefits and headcount impact in all functions are subject to completion of the requisite consultation in the various areas.\n\nOur priority, as we undertake these restructuring initiatives, is to work with our affected employees on the proposed changes, acting in accordance with relevant local consultation requirements and employment law.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n   For more information regarding  the AstraZeneca tax policy,  see our website, \n\nwww.astrazeneca.com/policies.",

At 31 December 2023, gross debt (interestbearing loans and borrowings) was $28,622 million (2022: $29,232 million). Of the gross debt outstanding, $5,400 million is due within one year (2022: $5,542 million).\n\nAt 31 December 2023, Cash and cash equivalents and Other investments totalled $5,962 million (2022: $6,405 million).\n\nThe Group had committed bank facilities of $6,875 million available to manage liquidity at 31 December 2023. $2.0 billion of the commitments mature in February 2025. The maturity of the $4,875 million facilities was extended in February 2024 from April 2026 to April 2029. All facilities contain no financial covenants and were undrawn at 31 December 2023. The Group regularly monitors the credit standing of the banks providing the facilities and currently does not anticipate any issue with drawing on the committed facilities should this be necessary. Advances under these facilities currently bear an interest rate per annum based on SOFR (Secured Overnight Financing Rate) plus a margin.\n\n## Net debt reconciliation\n\n## Financial position - 31 December 2023\n\nAll data in this section are on a Reported basis.\n\n## Acquisitions\n\nIn assessing whether an acquired set of assets and activities is a business or an asset, management will first elect whether to apply an optional concentration test to simplify the assessment. Where the concentration test is applied, the acquisition will be treated as the acquisition of an asset if substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired (excluding cash and cash equivalents, deferred tax assets, and related goodwill) is concentrated in a single asset or group of similar identifiable assets. Where the concentration test is not applied, or is not met, a further assessment of whether the acquired set of assets and activities is a business will be performed.\n\n## Acquisitions treated as Business combinations\n\nOn 16 January 2023, AstraZeneca completed the acquisition of Neogene, a global clinicalstage biotechnology company pioneering the discovery, development and manufacturing of next-generation T-cell receptor therapies (TCR-Ts). The purchase price allocation exercise has completed, with the fair value of total consideration determined at $267 million. Intangible assets of $100 million and goodwill of $158 million were recognised in the acquisition balance sheet, as well as a cash outflow of $189 million net of cash acquired.

(LogicBio), a clinical-stage genetic medicine company pioneering genome editing and gene delivery platforms to address rare and serious diseases from infancy through adulthood. The total consideration was $72 million. $68 million cash was paid on the completion date, with $4 million of outstanding options, which will be settled in cash, recorded in current Trade and other payables. LogicBio's results have been consolidated into the Group's results from 16 November 2022.\n\nThe acquisitions have been accounted for as business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with IFRS 3 'Business Combinations'.\n\n## Acquisitions treated as asset acquisitions\n\nOn 24 February 2023, AstraZeneca completed the acquisition of 100% of the issued shares of CinCor, for consideration of $1,268 million, which included intangible assets acquired of $780 million, $424 million of cash and cash equivalents, and $75 million of marketable securities. Contingent consideration of up to $496 million could be paid on achievement of regulatory milestones, and those liabilities will be recorded when milestones are triggered, or performance conditions have been satisfied.\n\nIn September 2023, AstraZeneca completed the definitive purchase and licence agreement for a portfolio of preclinical rare disease gene therapy programmes and enabling technologies from Pfizer. The agreement has a total consideration of up to $1 billion consisting of a $300 million upfront payment and $700 million of contingent consideration, plus tiered royalties on sales.\n\n## Commitments and contingencies\n\nWe have commitments and contingencies which are accounted for in line with Group Accounting Policies and are described in Note 30 to the Financial Statements from page 204.\n\nWe also have taxation contingencies. These are described in this Financial Review, in the Taxation section in the Critical accounting policies and estimates section from page 152, and in Note 30 to the Financial Statements from page 204.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n   For full details of acquisitions,  see Note 27 to the Financial  Statements from page 193.",

As detailed in Note 30, payments to our partners may not become payable due to the inherent uncertainty in achieving the development and revenue milestones linked to the future payments. We may enter into further collaboration projects in the future that may include milestone payments and, as certain milestone payments fail to crystallise due to, for example, failure to obtain regulatory approval, unfavourable data from key studies, adverse reactions to the product candidate or indications of other safety concerns, they may be replaced by potential payments under new collaborations.\n\n## Investments, divestments and capital expenditure\n\nWe have completed more than 60 major or strategically important business development transactions over the past three years.\n\nThe following strategic investment was made in 2023:\n\n## Eccogene\n\n- > In November 2023, AstraZeneca and Eccogene entered into an exclusive licence agreement for AZD5004, an investigational oral once-daily GLP-1RA for the treatment of obesity, type-2 diabetes and other cardiometabolic conditions. Preliminary results from the Phase I trial have shown a differentiating clinical profile for AZD5004, with good tolerability and encouraging glucose and body weight reduction across the dose levels tested compared to placebo. Under the terms of the agreement, Eccogene received an initial upfront payment of $185 million and up to an additional $1.8 billion in future clinical, regulatory, and commercial milestones and tiered royalties. AstraZeneca is granted exclusive global rights for the development and commercialisation of AZD5004 for any indication in all territories except China, where Eccogene has the right to codevelop and co-commercialise alongside AstraZeneca.\n\nIn addition to the business development transactions detailed under Collaboration Revenue from page 65 of this Financial Review, the following significant collaborations remain in the development phase:\n\n## Daiichi Sankyo\n\n- > In July 2020, AstraZeneca entered into a new global development and commercialisation agreement with Daiichi Sankyo for Dato-DXd, its proprietary trophoblast cell-surface antigen 2 (TROP2)directed ADC and potential new medicine for the treatment of multiple tumour types. AstraZeneca agreed to pay Daiichi Sankyo an upfront payment of $1 billion in staged payments: $350 million was due upon completion, with $325 million after 12 months and $325 million after 24 months from the effective date of the agreement. AstraZeneca also agreed to pay additional conditional amounts of up to $1 billion for the successful achievement of regulatory approvals and up to $4 billion for sales-related milestones. The transaction was accounted for as an intangible asset acquisition, recognised initially at the present value of non-contingent consideration, with any potential future milestone payments capitalised into the intangible asset as they are recognised. The companies will jointly develop and commercialise Dato-DXd worldwide, except in Japan where Daiichi Sankyo will retain exclusive rights. AstraZeneca and Daiichi Sankyo will share equally development and commercialisation expenses as well as profits relating to Dato-DXd worldwide, except for Japan where Daiichi Sankyo will be responsible for such costs and will pay AstraZeneca mid single-digit royalties. Daiichi Sankyo will record sales in the US, certain countries in Europe and certain other countries where Daiichi Sankyo has affiliates. Profits shared with AstraZeneca from those countries will be recorded as Alliance Revenue by AstraZeneca. AstraZeneca will record Product Sales in other countries worldwide, for which profits shared with Daiichi Sankyo will be recorded within Cost of sales. Daiichi Sankyo will manufacture and supply Dato-DXd.\n\n## Innate Pharma\n\n- > In April 2015, we entered into two oncology agreements with Innate Pharma: first, a licence which provides us with exclusive global rights to co-develop and commercialise IPH2201 in combination with Imfinzi ; and, second, an option to license exclusive global rights to co-develop and commercialise IPH2201 in monotherapy and other combinations in certain treatment areas. We jointly fund Phase II studies with Innate Pharma and we lead the execution of these studies. In respect of these agreements, we made an initial payment to Innate Pharma of $250 million. The agreement also includes a Phase III initiation milestone of $100 million, as well as additional regulatory and sales-related milestones. We record all sales and pay Innate Pharma double-digit royalties on net sales. The arrangement includes the right for Innate Pharma to co-promote in Europe for an equal share of costs and income in the territory.\n\n- > In October 2018, we exercised our option over IPH2201 and simultaneously entered into a further multi-element transaction with Innate Pharma. Under the agreement, we paid $50 million to collaborate on, and acquire an option to license, IPH5201, a potentially first-in-class anti-CD39 mAb. Additionally, we paid $20 million to acquire options over four future programmes currently being developed by Innate Pharma, and paid \u20ac62.6 million to acquire a 9.8% stake in Innate Pharma. The $100 million option fee and $50 million premium paid over market price for the investment in Innate Pharma have been capitalised as intangible assets. The payment for future programmes will be expensed as R&D expenditure over four years.\n\nWe determine these business development transactions to be significant using a range of factors. We look at the specific circumstances of the individual arrangement and apply several quantitative and qualitative criteria. As we consider business development transactions to be an extension of our R&D strategy, the expected total value of development payments under the transaction and its proportion of our annual R&D spend, both of which are proxies for overall R&D effort and cost, are important elements of the determination of the significance. Other quantitative criteria we apply include, without limitation, expected levels of future sales, the possible value of milestone payments and the resources used for commercialisation activities (for example, the number of staff). Qualitative factors we consider include, without limitation, new market developments, new territories, new areas of research and strategic implications.",

        "page_content": "## Capitalisation and shareholder return Capitalisation\n\nThe total number of shares in issue at 31 December 2023 was 1,550 million (2022: 1,550 million).\n\nShareholders' equity increased by $2,106 million to $39,143 million at the year end. Non-controlling interests were $23 million (2022: $21 million).\n\n## Dividend and share repurchases\n\nThe Board has recommended a second interim dividend of $1.97 (156.0 pence, 20.65 SEK) to be paid on 25 March 2024. This brings the full-year dividend to $2.90 (227.8 pence, 30.29 SEK). Against Reported EPS, the Group had a dividend cover ratio of 1.32:1 in 2023 (2022: 0.74:1). Against Core EPS, the Group had a dividend cover ratio of 2.50:1 in 2023 (2022: 2.32:1). This dividend is consistent with the progressive dividend policy, by which, the Board intends to maintain or grow the dividend each year.\n\nThe Board regularly reviews its distribution policy and its overall financial strategy to continue to strike a balance between the interests of the business, our financial creditors and our shareholders. Having regard for business investment, funding the progressive dividend policy and meeting our debt service obligations, the Board currently believes it is appropriate to continue the suspension of the share repurchase programme which was announced in 2012.\n\nThe Board reviews the level of distributable reserves of the Parent Company annually and aims to maintain distributable reserves that provide adequate cover for dividend payments. At 31 December 2023, the overwhelming majority of the Profit and loss account reserve of $17,640 million (2022: all of the Profit and loss account reserve of $7,458 million) was available for distribution, subject to filing these Financial Statements with Companies House. When making a distribution to shareholders, the Directors determine profits available for distribution by reference to guidance on realised and distributable profits under the Companies Act 2006 issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales and the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Scotland in April 2017.\n\nThe profits of the Parent Company have been received in the form of receivables due from subsidiaries. The availability of distributable reserves in the Parent Company is dependent on those receivables meeting the definition of qualifying consideration within the guidance, and in particular on the ability of subsidiaries to settle those receivables within a reasonable period of time. The Directors consider that, based on the nature of these receivables and the available cash resources of the Group and other accessible sources of funds, at 31 December 2023, the overwhelming majority (2022: all) of the Company's profit and loss reserves were available for distribution.\n\n## Future prospects\n\nAs outlined earlier in this Annual Report, our strategic priorities support delivery of our Growth Through Innovation strategy and our Purpose: to push the boundaries of science to deliver life-changing medicines.\n\nIn support of this, we made certain choices around our three strategic priorities:\n\n- > Science and Innovation\n- > Growth and Therapy Area Leadership\n- > People and Sustainability.\n\n## Full year 2024: additional commentary\n\nTotal Revenue is expected to increase by a low double-digit to low teens percentage. Core EPS is expected to increase by a low double-digit to low teens percentage.\n\nCollaboration Revenue is expected to increase substantially, driven by successbased milestones and certain anticipated transactions. Other operating income is expected to decrease substantially (2023 included a $241m gain on the disposal of Pulmicort Flexhaler US rights, and a $712m one-time gain relating to updates to contractual arrangements with Sobi and Sanofi). The Core Tax rate is expected to be between 18-22%.\n\nThe Group is unable to provide guidance on a Reported basis because it cannot reliably forecast material elements of the Reported results, including any fair value adjustments arising on acquisition-related liabilities, intangible asset impairment charges and legal settlement provisions. Please refer to the Cautionary statement section regarding forward-looking statements on page 236.\n\n## Currency impact\n\nIf foreign exchange rates for February 2024 to December 2024 were to remain at the average rates seen in January 2024, it is anticipated that 2024 Total Revenue and Core EPS for the year would incur a low single-digit adverse impact versus the performance at CER.\n\nThis commentary represents management's current estimates and is subject to change. See the Cautionary statement regarding forward-looking statements on page 236.\n\n## Financial risk management Financial risk management policies Insurance\n\nOur risk management processes are described in Risk Overview from page 54. These processes enable us to identify risks that can be partly or entirely mitigated through the use of insurance. We focus our insurance resources on the most critical areas, or where there is a legal requirement, and where we can get the best value for money through structured and traditional insurance. We purchase an external multi-line insurance programme to mitigate against significant financial loss arising from core business risks.\n\n## Treasury\n\nThe principal financial risks to which we are exposed are those arising from liquidity, interest rates, foreign currency and credit. We have a centralised treasury function to manage these risks in accordance with Board-approved policies. Note 28 to the Financial Statements from page 195 sets out the relevant policies and the way we manage these risks and our capital management objectives, as well as a sensitivity analysis of the Group's exposure to exchange rate and interest rate movements.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n \n\n    For further information  regarding Dividends, see Note 25  on page 192. \n\n  For more information, see Our  Strategy and Key Performance  Indicators from page 12.",

        "page_content": "## Financial Review continued\n\n## Critical accounting policies and estimates\n\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with UK-adopted IAS and with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 as applicable to companies reporting under those standards. The Consolidated Financial Statements also comply fully with IFRS Accounting Standards as issued by the IASB and IAS as adopted by the EU. The accounting policies employed are set out in the Group Accounting Policies section from page 152. In applying these policies, we make estimates and assumptions that affect the Reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. The actual outcome could differ from those estimates. Some of these policies require a high level of judgement because the areas are especially subjective or complex.\n\nWe believe that the most critical accounting policies and significant areas of judgement and estimation are in the following areas and align with the accounting policies containing our key accounting judgements and significant accounting estimates as disclosed in the Financial Statements from page 152:\n\n- > Revenue recognition - see Revenue Accounting Policy from page 152 and Note 1 on page 161\n- > Expensing of internal development expenses - see Research and Development Policy from page 154\n- > Impairment review of Intangible assets see Note 10 on page 174\n- > Useful economic life of Intangible assets - see Research and Development from page 154\n- > Business combinations and Goodwill - see Business combinations and Goodwill Policy from page 156 and Note 27 from page 193\n- > Litigation liabilities - see Litigation and Environmental Liabilities within Note 30 on page 204\n- > Operating segments - see Note 6 on page 167\n- > Employee benefits - see Note 22 on page 190\n- > Taxation - see Tax in Note 30 from page 209.\n\n## Revenue recognition\n\nProduct Sales are recorded at the invoiced amount (excluding inter-company sales and value-added taxes), less movements in estimated accruals for rebates and chargebacks given to managed care and other customers, which are a particular feature in the US and are considered to be key estimates. It is the Group's policy to offer a credit note for all returns and to destroy all returned stock in all markets. Cash discounts for prompt payments are also discounted from sales. Sales are recognised when the control of the goods has been transferred to a third party, which is usually when title passes to the customer, either on shipment or on the receipt of goods by the customer, depending on local trading terms.\n\n## Rebates, chargebacks and returns in the US\n\nWhen invoicing Product Sales in the US, we estimate the rebates and chargebacks that we expect to pay, which are considered to be estimates. These rebates typically arise from sales contracts with third-party managed care organisations, hospitals, long-term care facilities, group purchasing organisations and various federal or state programmes (Medicaid contracts, supplemental rebates, etc.). They can be classified as follows:\n\n- > Chargebacks, where we enter into arrangements under which certain parties, typically hospitals, long-term care facilities, group purchasing organisations, the Department of Veterans Affairs, Public Health Service Covered Entities, and the Department of Defense, are able to buy products from wholesalers at the lower prices we have contracted with them. The chargeback is the difference between the price we invoice to the wholesaler and the contracted price charged by the wholesaler to the other party. Chargebacks are credited directly to the wholesalers.\n- > Regulatory, including Medicaid and other federal and state programmes, where we pay rebates based on the specific terms of agreements with the US Department of Health and Human Services and with individual states, which include product usage and information on best prices and average market prices benchmarks.\n- > Contractual, under which entities such as third-party managed care organisations are entitled to rebates depending on specified performance provisions, which vary from contract to contract.\n\nThe effects of these deductions on our US pharmaceuticals revenue and the movements on US pharmaceuticals revenue provisions are set out on this page.\n\nAccrual assumptions are built up on a product-by-product and customer-bycustomer basis, taking into account specific contract provisions coupled with expected performance, and are then aggregated into a weighted average rebate accrual rate for each of our products. Accrual rates are reviewed and adjusted on an as needed basis. There may be further adjustments when actual rebates are invoiced based on utilisation information submitted to us (in the case of contractual rebates) and claims/invoices are received (in the case of regulatory rebates and chargebacks). We believe that we have made reasonable estimates for future rebates using a similar methodology to that of previous years. Inevitably, however, these estimates involve assumptions in respect of aggregate future sales levels, segment mix and customers' contractual performance.\n\nOverall adjustments between gross and net US Product Sales amounted to $18,607 million in 2023 (2022: $14,846 million) with the increase driven by our US Product Sales.\n\nCash discounts are offered to customers to encourage prompt payment. Accruals are calculated based on historical experience and are adjusted to reflect actual experience. Our revenue recognition policy is described within Group Accounting Policies from page 152.\n\nIndustry practice in the US allows wholesalers and pharmacies to return unused stocks within six months of, and up to 12 months after, shelf-life expiry. The customer is credited for the returned product by the issuance of a credit note. Returned products are not exchanged for products from inventory and once a return claim has been determined to be valid and a credit note has been issued to the customer, the returned products are destroyed. At the point of sale in the US, we estimate the quantity and value of products which may ultimately be returned. Our returns accruals in the US are based on actual experience. Our estimate is based on the historical sales and returns information for established products together with marketrelated information, such as estimated shelf life, product recall, and estimated stock levels at wholesalers, which we receive via thirdparty information services. For newly launched products, we use rates based on our experience with similar products or a pre-determined percentage.\n\n## Sarbanes-Oxley Act section 404\n\nAs a consequence of our Nasdaq listing, we are required to comply with those provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act applicable to foreign issuers. Section 404 of the SarbanesOxley Act requires companies annually to assess and make public statements about the quality and effectiveness of their internal control over financial reporting. As regards Sarbanes-Oxley Act section 404, our approach is based on the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (COSO) 2013 framework.\n\nOur approach to the assessment has been to select key transaction and financial reporting processes in our largest operating units and a number of specialist areas (e.g. financial consolidation and reporting, treasury operations and taxation), so that, in aggregate, we have covered a significant proportion of the key lines in our Financial Statements. Each of these operating units and specialist areas has ensured that its relevant processes and controls are documented to appropriate standards, taking into account, in particular, the guidance provided by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nWe have also reviewed the structure and operation of our 'entity level' control environment. This refers to the overarching control environment, including structure of reviews, checks and balances that are essential to the management of a well controlled business.",

The Board  acknowledges that every decision made will  not necessarily result in a positive outcome  for all stakeholders. By considering our  Purpose and Values, together with our  strategic priorities, the Board aims to ensure  that the decisions made are consistent and  intended to promote the Company's  long-term success.\n\nThe Group engaged with key stakeholders  throughout the year to understand the issues  and factors that are significant for these  stakeholders, and a number of actions were  taken as a result of this engagement. The  interaction, and impact of these interactions,  are set out in the Connecting with our  stakeholders section on pages 84 to 86 and  throughout the Strategic Report.\n\nWe are committed to being a great place to  work for the global workforce. Details on  engagement with employees can be found  on pages 43 to 45 of the Business Review,  from page 84 of the Corporate Governance  Report, page 97 in the Audit Committee  Report and page 121 to 122 of the  Remuneration Committee Report.\n\nWe are committed to employing high ethical  standards when carrying out all aspects of  our business globally. Our Code of Ethics  (the Code) is based on our Values, expected  behaviours and key policy principles. More  information on the Code can be found in the  Business Review on page 49.\n\nAstraZeneca recognises patients as people  first and puts them at the heart of what we  do. Information on the importance of  patients to the business can be found on  page 84, with further information  throughout the Business Review.\n\nThe consideration and impact of the Group's  operations on the environment and how the  Group has considered other factors, such as  communities and suppliers, can be found  throughout the People and Sustainability  section from page 43.\n\nDetails of how the Board operates and  matters considered by the Board are set out  in the Corporate Governance Report from  page 75. Details on the Board and SET  composition and gender diversity can be  found on pages 78, 91, and 229. Examples of  how Directors discharged their duties and  considered stakeholders when making  Principal Decisions during 2023 are set out  from page 84. Principal Decisions are  decisions and discussions which are  material or strategic to the Group, but also  those that are significant to any of our  stakeholder groups.\n\n## Strategic Report\n\nThe following sections make up the Strategic  Report, which has been prepared in accordance  with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006:\n\n- > Chair's Statement\n- > Chief Executive Officer's Review\n- > AstraZeneca at a Glance\n- > What science can do: artificial intelligence \n- > Healthcare in a Changing World\n- > Our Purpose, Values and Business Model\n- > Our Strategy and Key Performance Indicators \n- > Therapy Area Review \n- > Business Review\n- > EU Taxonomy Disclosure\n- > Task Force on Climate-related Financial  Disclosures Summary Statement \n- > Risk Overview \n- > Financial Review \n\nand has been approved and signed on behalf  of the Board.\n\n## A C N Kemp\n\nCompany Secretary  8 February 2024",

This Report reviews AstraZeneca's governance and the work of the Board's Committees.\n\nI would like to begin by thanking my fellow Directors for the support they have given me in my first year as Chair and welcoming Anna Manz who became a Non-Executive Director and member of the Audit Committee in September. She brings extensive cross-sector business skills and knowledge to the Board, having held international roles in North America and Asia Pacific and served as an executive and non-executive in large, listed companies.\n\nI also want to recognise the role that all the Directors play in carrying out their responsibilities as members of our Board Committees. I am particularly grateful to the chairs of the Committees for the diligent and committed way in which they carry out their duties, especially Philip Broadley who, in addition to his important role as Chair of the Audit Committee, performs the role of our senior independent Non-Executive Director. Finally, I would like to thank Euan Ashley who assumed the role as Chair of the Science Committee during the year.\n\nI would urge readers to read the reports from the individual Committee Chairs that give an indication of the depth and breadth of their work on behalf of shareholders. This Governance Report also reports on how we consider the interests of our stakeholders and engage with them in determining our strategy.\n\nThe Audit Committee has a key role in monitoring the integrity of our financial reporting and management of risk. Cyber risk and cyber security have been, and continue to be, a particular focus of their activity in recent years. During 2023, the Audit Committee as\n\nwell as the Sustainability Committee, had an important role considering the potential and enacted regulations by the US, EU and UK on sustainability reporting, as well as the ongoing assessments of double materiality topics for AstraZeneca under EU regulations, to ensure that we are prepared for new sustainability reporting regulations which you will see reflected in AstraZeneca's 2024 Annual Report. The Sustainability Committee also reviewed progress against our Ambition Zero Carbon targets and programmes.\n\nEuan and the Science Committee had a particularly busy year in reviewing our R&D strategy and science capabilities as well as studying the scientific case for the numerous acquisitions and licensing opportunities that were undertaken during 2023.\n\nA particular responsibility of the Remuneration Committee in 2023 was to review and update our Remuneration Policy, which can be found from page 127 and will be proposed for approval by our shareholders at the AGM in April. In doing so, we are introducing some changes the Board believes are in the best interests of the Group and its shareholders, and which will incentivise management to deliver our ambitious strategy.\n\nGood governance underpins any successful enterprise and I look forward to continuing my role in ensuring that AstraZeneca's future growth and prospects are accompanied and enabled by good governance overseen by a skilled and diverse Board of Directors.\n\nMichel Demar\u00e9 Chair\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Board maintains and periodically reviews a list of matters that can only be approved by the Board. Matters that have not been expressly reserved to the Board in this way are delegated to the CEO or one of the Board's five Committees.

        "page_content": "## Corporate Governance Report Compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code\n\n## Statement of compliance\n\nOur statement of compliance below describes how we applied the principles in the 2018 UK Corporate Governance Code (the Code) for the year ended 31 December 2023. A copy of the Code can be found on the Financial Reporting Council's (FRC) website, www.frc.org.uk. Throughout the accounting period we have complied with all the provisions of the Code other than provision 21, which relates to the Board's annual performance evaluation. Our approach to the Board's performance evaluation for 2023 is described on page 89.\n\n## Additional information for Swedish shareholders\n\nThe Company is incorporated under the laws of England and Wales and its shares are listed on the London Stock Exchange, Nasdaq Stockholm and the Nasdaq Global Select Market in the US. In accordance with the Company's listing on the London Stock Exchange, it applies the principles set out in the Code. As a result of its listing on Nasdaq Stockholm and in accordance with Swedish regulations, the Company is required to disclose the material ways in which its corporate governance practices differ from those applied by Swedish companies following the Swedish Corporate Governance Code (the Swedish Code). The Company has made available on its website www.astrazeneca.com/investor-relations/ corporate-governance.html a summary of the material ways in which the corporate governance practices applied by the Company differ from the principles of the Swedish Code. In addition, as required by Swedish regulations, the Company has also made available on its website a general description of the main differences in minority shareholders' rights between the Company's place of domicile (the UK) and Sweden, where the Company's shares are also admitted to trading.\n\n## 1. Board leadership and Company purpose\n\n## A. Board's role\n\nThe Board's role is to promote the long-term sustainable success of the Company. The Directors' diverse range of skills, experience and industry knowledge, and ability to exercise independent and objective judgement, help the Board to operate effectively in its oversight of delivery of the Group's strategy, generation of shareholder value and contributions to wider society.\n\nThe Board's effective operation is underpinned by a sound governance structure, described on page 77. Through a programme of regular Board and Board Committee meetings, Directors receive information on AstraZeneca's financial performance, the R&D pipeline and critical business issues. The Board is accountable to our shareholders for the proper conduct of the business and our long-term success and seeks to represent the interests of all stakeholders.\n\n## B. Purpose, culture and strategy\n\nThe Board believes that our Purpose, to push the boundaries of science to deliver lifechanging medicines, positions AstraZeneca for long-term sustainable success.\n\nOur Code of Ethics and our Values underpin the behaviours that support our culture.\n\nThe Board is responsible for setting our strategy and policies, overseeing risk and corporate governance, and monitoring progress towards meeting our objectives and annual plans. The Board conducts an annual review of the Group's overall strategy.\n\n## C. Resources and controls\n\nThe Board ensures that the necessary resources are in place to help the Company meet its objectives and measure its performance against them.\n\nThe Group Internal Audit and Compliance functions provide quarterly reports to the Audit Committee on their activities and annual reviews of key themes, processes and systems (including arrangements for whistleblowing). The Board has full oversight of these matters by way of the Audit Committee Chair's reports to the Board after each Committee meeting. Board members are also able to access the information provided to the Audit Committee.\n\nThe Board has a formal system in place for Directors to declare a conflict, or potential conflict, of interest.\n\n## D. Stakeholder engagement\n\nThe Board aims to ensure a good dialogue is maintained with shareholders, so that their views are understood and considered. The Board also engages with and considers wider stakeholder groups, including the workforce, in its decision making.\n\n## E. Workforce policies\n\nBased on our Values, expected behaviours and key policy principles, the Code of Ethics empowers employees to make decisions in the best interests of the Group, the Company, society and the patients we serve. It is applicable to the Group worldwide, including the Board.\n\n## 2. Division of responsibilities\n\n## F. Chair of the Board\n\nMichel Demar\u00e9, our Non-Executive Chair, is responsible for the Board's overall effectiveness in directing the Company. Mr Demar\u00e9 was first appointed to the Board in 2019 and was considered to be independent on his appointment as Chair in April 2023.\n\n## G. Board composition, independence and division of responsibilities\n\nThe composition of the Board is set out on pages 78 and 79. The majority of the Board consists of independent Non-Executive Directors. Directors' independence is considered annually by the Board, as described on page 83.\n\nThe Directors are collectively responsible for the success of the Group. The roles of the Board, Board Committees, Chair, senior independent Non-Executive Director and CEO are documented, as are the Board's reserved powers and delegated authorities. The Board's responsibilities and the governance structure by which it delegates authority are outlined in the Corporate Governance Overview on page 77.\n\nThe Board maintains a list of matters that are reserved to, and can only be approved by, the Board. These include: the appointment, termination and remuneration of any Director; approval of the annual budget; approval of any item of fixed capital expenditure or any proposal for the acquisition or disposal of an investment or business which exceeds $300 million; the raising of capital or loans by the Company (subject to certain exceptions); the giving of any guarantee in respect of any borrowing of the Company; and allotting shares of the Company. Matters that have not been expressly reserved to the Board are delegated to the Committees of the Board or the CEO.\n\n## H. Non-Executive Directors' role and time commitment\n\nThe Non-Executive Directors exercise objective judgement in respect of Board decisions, providing scrutiny and challenge and holding management to account. Non-Executive Directors offer strategic guidance and specialist advice based on their breadth of experience and knowledge. The Non-Executive Directors regularly meet without the Executive Directors or other management present.\n\nFor more information on:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur Purpose, our Values and our Business Model, see page 10.\n\nOur Code of Ethics, see page 49.\n\nOur resources and controls, see the Audit Committee Report from page 94.\n\nConflicts of interest, see page 225.\n\nStakeholder engagement, see pages 84 to 86 and throughout the Strategic Report. Our section 172(1) statement is set out on page 74.\n\nThe Board's performance evaluation, see page 89.",

        "page_content": "## Corporate Governance Report\n\n## Compliance with the UK\n\n## Corporate Governance Code continued\n\nThe Company's senior independent NonExecutive Director serves as a sounding board for the Chair and as an intermediary for the other Directors when necessary. The senior independent Non-Executive Director is also available to shareholders if they have concerns that contact through the normal channels of Chair or Executive Directors has failed to resolve, or for which such contact is inappropriate. Philip Broadley was appointed senior independent Non-Executive Director on 1 March 2021.\n\nAs well as their work in relation to formal Board and Board Committee meetings, Non-Executive Directors commit time throughout the year to meetings and telephone calls with various levels of executive management and other key stakeholders, visits to AstraZeneca's sites throughout the world (whether in person or virtually) and, for new Directors, induction sessions and site visits. The Chair and individual Board members ensure that Board members' time commitment to the Company is sufficient to fulfil their duties as Directors and fully discharge their obligations to shareholders, particularly in the case of the Chairs of Board Committees. For the Chair of the Board, generally, as a basic commitment, it is expected that they would need to devote about 40% of their time or the equivalent of not less than 90 days per annum in the fulfilment of their duties.\n\nWhen contemplating taking up additional appointments, Non-Executive Directors consult the Chair to ensure thought is given to any potential impact on their time commitment to AstraZeneca. Careful consideration is given to the nature of the potential appointment and the type of company involved (for example, whether the company is a public listed company or privately held), to help assess the likely time requirement. For significant additional appointments, the full Board would typically be involved in this process.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information on:\n\nThe Nomination and Governance Committee Report, see from page 90.\n\nExternal audit, see page 96 and Note 31 to the Financial Statements, on page 210.\n\nInternal Audit, see page 96.\n\nThe ways in which we manage our business risks, our procedures for identifying our emerging risks, how we describe our Principal Risks and uncertainties, and our Viability statement, see Risk management and controls on the following page, and the Risk Overview from page 54.\n\nThe Remuneration Committee's work, see page 102.\n\nIn 2023, Aradhana Sarin was appointed as an independent director of Anheuser-Busch InBev and Philip Broadley was appointed as a Non-Executive Director and Chair-designate of Lancashire Holdings Limited. These appointments were considered and approved by the Board on the basis that they would not prevent or reduce the ability of either to perform their roles for AstraZeneca to the required standard.\n\nThe performance of the Non-Executive Directors is assessed annually as part of the Board's performance evaluation, as described on page 89.\n\nSubject to specific Board approval, Executive Directors and SET members may accept external appointments as non-executive directors of other companies and retain any related fees paid to them, provided that such appointments are not considered by the Board to prevent or reduce the ability of the executive to perform his or her role within the Group to the required standard.\n\n## I. Company Secretary\n\nThe Company Secretary is responsible to the Chair for ensuring that all Board and Board Committee meetings are properly conducted, that the Directors receive appropriate information prior to meetings to enable them to make an effective contribution and that governance requirements are considered and implemented. The 2023 Board performance evaluation set out on page 89 provides details of the effective operation of the Board.\n\n## 3. Composition, succession and evaluation\n\n## J. Appointments and succession planning\n\nThe Nomination and Governance Committee and, where appropriate, the full Board, regularly review the composition of the Board and the status of succession to both SET- and Board-level positions. Directors have regular contact with, and access to, succession candidates for SET positions. The Committee also recognises the importance of diversity when considering potential appointments.\n\nThere is a formal, rigorous and transparent procedure for appointments to the Board. The Nomination and Governance Committee Report details changes in Board composition during the year, and the appointment and induction processes, from page 90.\n\nIn accordance with Article 66 of the Articles of Association of the Company (the Articles), all Directors retire at each AGM and may offer themselves for re-election by shareholders. The Notice of AGM will give details of those Directors seeking election or re-election.\n\n## K. Skills, experience and knowledge\n\nWhen the Nomination and Governance Committee reviews the composition of the Board and its Committees, it uses a matrix that records the skills and experience of current Board members and compares this\n\nwith the skills and experience it believes are appropriate to the Company's overall business and strategic needs, both now and in the future.\n\nThe Committee is also mindful of Directors' lengths of tenure and the need to refresh Board membership over time.\n\n## L. Board evaluation\n\nIn 2023, the Board undertook an internal Board performance evaluation. More information on the evaluation process, including the results and actions taken, can be found on page 89.\n\n## 4. Audit, risk and internal control M. Internal and external audit\n\nThe Audit Committee is responsible for reviewing the relationship and independence of our external auditor,\n\nPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC). The Committee maintains a policy for the pre-approval of all audit services and audit-related services undertaken by the external auditor, the principal purpose of which is to ensure that the independence of the external auditor is not impaired. A tender of audit services will be conducted in 2024 with any change taking effect from 2027. More information can be found on page 101.\n\nThe Audit Committee also reviews the independence and effectiveness of Group Internal Audit.\n\n## N. Fair, balanced and understandable assessment\n\nThe Board considers this Annual Report, taken as a whole, to be fair, balanced and understandable, and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess AstraZeneca's position and performance, business model and strategy. The Board's assessment is described on page 100.\n\nThe Board and the Audit Committee review the Company's quarterly financial results announcements to ensure they present a fair, balanced and understandable assessment of the Company's position and prospects to shareholders.\n\n## O. Risk management\n\nThe Board is responsible for the Company's risk management system and internal controls, and their effectiveness. The Board delegates some responsibilities for risk management oversight to the Audit Committee, such as quarterly reviews of the Company's principal and key active risks. During 2023, the Directors continued to review the effectiveness of our system of controls, risk management (including a robust assessment of the emerging and principal risks) and high-level internal control processes. This included an annual Governance and Assurance Report to all Directors, which is considered in detail by the Audit Committee and reviewed by the Board.",

        "page_content": "Any areas of concern are highlighted in the Audit Committee Chair's update to Directors at the relevant Board meeting and discussed by the Board. The Report is based on a full year-end review of the Company's risk and control processes (incorporating financial, operational and compliance controls) and findings from assurance processes.\n\nThe Directors believe that the Group maintains an effective, embedded system of internal controls and complies with the FRC's guidance entitled 'Guidance on Risk Management, Internal Control and Related Financial and Business Reporting'.\n\n## 5. Remuneration\n\n## P. Remuneration policies and practices\n\nThe Remuneration Committee is responsible for determining, approving and reviewing the Company's global remuneration principles and frameworks, to ensure that they support the strategy of the Company and are designed to promote long-term sustainable success.\n\n## Q. Developing executive remuneration policy\n\nThe Remuneration Committee routinely reviews the Directors' Remuneration Policy and executive remuneration arrangements to ensure they continue to promote the delivery of the long-term strategy and support the Company's ability to recruit and retain executive talent to deliver against that strategy. The Committee also considers remuneration arrangements in the context of corporate governance best practice and arrangements for the wider workforce, and regularly consults with its major investors on remuneration proposals. No Director is involved in determining their own remuneration arrangements or outcomes.\n\n## R. Remuneration outcomes and independent judgement\n\nTo ensure it maintains independent judgement when determining remuneration outcomes, the Remuneration Committee considers a range of data including detailed business and individual performance information. The Committee also consults with other Board Committees to utilise their expertise when determining performance outcomes.\n\n## Further information on Directors' appointments\n\n## Chair of the Board\n\nMr Demar\u00e9 was appointed as Chair of the Board at the conclusion of the 2023 AGM, following Mr Johansson's retirement, and he was considered independent upon appointment.\n\n## Non-Executive Directors' independence\n\nIn December 2023, the Board considered the independence of the Non-Executive Directors, other than the Chair of the Board, for the purposes of the Code and the Nasdaq Listing Rules. Taking into account the recommendations set out in the Code and the Nasdaq Listing Rules, the Board considers that all the Non-Executive Directors except Marcus Wallenberg are independent. Marcus Wallenberg was appointed as a Director of Astra in May 1989 and subsequently became a Director of the Company in 1999. He is a Non-Executive Director of Investor AB, which has a 3.33% interest in the issued share capital of the Company as at 7 February 2024. For these reasons - his overall length of tenure and relationship with a significant shareholder - the Board does not believe that he can be determined independent under the Code. However, the Board believes that he has brought, and continues to bring, considerable business experience and makes a valuable contribution to the work of the Board.\n\nAs well as being a Non-Executive Director of AstraZeneca and Chair of the Board's Sustainability Committee, Nazneen Rahman is the Director of the Sustainable Medicines Partnership (SMP), a multi-stakeholder, not-for-profit collaboration with the aim of advancing the environmental sustainability of medicines. AstraZeneca is a strategic collaborator in the SMP. Dr Rahman has recused herself from acting as the lead contact for the SMP in its relationship with AstraZeneca, and this relationship, including project work and overall programme management, is handled by other members of the SMP team.\n\n## Risk management and controls Global Compliance and Group Internal Audit (GIA)\n\nThrough our compliance programme and three lines of defence risk management framework (line management; Risk and Compliance functions; GIA), Global Compliance helps the Group achieve its priorities and do business the right way. It takes a global approach that addresses key risk areas, including those related to third parties and anti-bribery/anti-corruption. Its work helps us to reinforce compliant behaviours through our Code of Ethics, policies, training, advice and guidance. We also conduct risk assessment activities and foster a culture where individuals can raise concerns.\n\nWe take alleged compliance breaches and concerns seriously. We investigate and take appropriate disciplinary and remediation action to address and prevent reoccurrence through internal functions and external advisers. Depending on breach severity, the Group may need to disclose and/or report the incident to a regulatory or government authority.\n\nGlobal Compliance provides assurance insights to the Audit Committee on compliance matters. GIA carries out a range of audits and periodically reviews the assurance activities of other Group functions.\n\nThe results from these activities are reported to the Audit Committee. Global Compliance and GIA share outcomes and coordinate reporting on compliance matters throughout the organisation. GIA is established by the Audit Committee on behalf of the Board and acts as an independent and objective assurance function guided by a philosophy of adding value to improve the operational control framework of the Group. The scope of GIA's responsibilities encompasses, but is not limited to, the examination and evaluation of the adequacy and effectiveness of the Group's governance, risk management and internal control processes in relation to the Group's defined goals and objectives.\n\nAmong others, internal control objectives considered by GIA include:\n\n- > Compliance with significant policies, plans, procedures, laws and regulations.\n- > Consistency of operations or programmes with established objectives and goals, and effective performance.\n- > Safeguarding of assets.\n\nBased on its activity, GIA is responsible for reporting significant risk exposures and control issues identified to the Board and to senior management, including fraud risks, governance issues and other matters needed or requested by the Audit Committee. It may also evaluate specific operations at the request of the Audit Committee or management, as appropriate.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information on the Remuneration Committee, see the Directors' Remuneration Report, from page 102.",

The Board considered the benefit of these investments for patients and investors, alongside the potential impact of acquiring debt.\n- > Considered the Group's liquidity position and the expectations of investors regarding the progressive dividend policy.\n\n## Board Committees' composition and succession planning\n\nDuring 2023, the Board reviewed and made the following appointments:\n\n- > Appointment of Michel Demar\u00e9 as Chair of the Nomination and Governance Committee.\n- > Appointment of Nazneen Rahman as a member of the Remuneration Committee.\n- > Appointment of Euan Ashley as Chair of the Science Committee.\n- > Appointment of Euan Ashley as a member of the Nomination and Governance Committee.\n- > Appointment of Anna Manz as a NonExecutive Director and member of the Audit Committee.\n\n## The Board considered: investors; the long-term\n\nsuccess of the Company; and maintaining high standards of business conduct.\n\n## How the Board had regard for these matters:\n\n- > Engaged with a number of AstraZeneca's largest shareholders for them to hear about the search processes and to understand their views.\n- > Considered the Board's diversity, time commitments of the candidates and other relevant UK Corporate Governance Code provisions, as well as other Board-level succession planning considerations.\n- > Reviewed the experience of potential candidates and met those who were shortlisted to evaluate which individuals had the skills required to support management in the continued delivery of value to shareholders and life-changing medicines to patients, while also maintaining high standards of business conduct.\n\n- > Considered the succession requirements of the Board, the length of tenure of the current Non-Executive Directors and the independence requirements as set out in the UK Corporate Governance Code, and the importance of ensuring a smooth and orderly transition.\n- > Considered the continuity and reassurance the appointments provided to management and investors, and had regard to the likely consequences of the decision in the long term and the interests of those most affected.\n\n## Acquisitions and collaborations to strengthen the pipeline\n\nDuring 2023, the Board considered, and approved, a number of transactions to strengthen the Group's pipeline and accelerate the development of potentially life-changing medicines. These included the acquisition of CinCor Pharma; the acquisition of a rare disease gene therapy portfolio and technologies from Pfizer; the research and collaboration agreement with Quell Therapeutics; the approval of the equity investment and global research and collaboration agreement in cell and gene therapy with Cellectis; the approval of the in-licensing of AZD5004 from Eccogene; the acquisition of Gracell Biotechnologies; and the acquisition of Icosavax.\n\n## The Board considered: investors; the\n\nlong-term success of the Company; employees; patients; and maintaining high standards of business conduct.\n\n## How the Board had regard to these matters:\n\n- > Reviewed the unmet medical need and considered how the transactions would further strengthen the Group's pipeline.\n- > Considered the benefits to patients if the Group was able to accelerate the development of novel treatments, which could potentially deepen clinical responses and improve patient outcomes.\n- > Considered the financial impact of the transactions on the Group's viability and capital allocation priorities, alongside the financial benefits from the acquisitions if the technologies were successful.\n\n## Divestment of Pulmicort Flexhaler in the US\n\nDuring 2023, the Board approved the divestment of Pulmicort Flexhaler in the US to Cheplapharm.\n\n## The Board considered: investors; the\n\nlong-term success of the Company; patients; and maintaining high standards of business conduct.\n\n## How the Board had regard to these matters:\n\n- > Considered the Company's long-term strategy, the status of Pulmicort intellectual property in the US and the potential impact this may have on revenue, as well as the investment required in the pipeline to ensure the development of further lifechanging medicines.\n- > Recognised the importance in ensuring that appropriate arrangements were in place to ensure the continued supply of medicines to patients.\n- > Considered the financial benefit of the divestment and how this could be reinvested, to further benefit patients and shareholders.\n\n## Settlement of patent litigation\n\nIn July 2023, the Board approved the settlement of the patent litigation with Bristol-Myers Squibb and related parties relating to Imfinzi and Imjudo .\n\n## The Board considered: investors; the\n\nlong-term success of the Company; and maintaining high standards of business conduct.\n\n## How the Board had regard to these matters:\n\n- > Reviewed the financial impact of the settlement and the potential benefits and risks of continuing with the litigation.\n- > Considered the settlement value compared to the cost of continued litigation and the potential size of damages which were being sought.\n- > The time and efforts required from management in continuing to defend the litigation and the potential distraction this could create.\n\n## Board's reserved powers and delegation of authority to the CEO\n\nIn May 2023, the Board reviewed its reserved powers and delegation of authority to the CEO, and made the following changes:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor the Section 172(1) statement, see page 74.\n\nFor more information on funding, see Note 28 to the Financial Statements from page 195.\n\nFor more information on committees' composition and succession planning, see the Nomination and Governance Committee Report from page 90.\n\nFor more information on acquisitions and collaborations, see Business development from page 42.\n\nFor more information on patent litigation, see Patent litigation in Note 30 to the Financial Statements from page 204.",

Engagement with employees is an important element in ensuring an environment in which all employees are respected, where openness is valued, diversity celebrated and every voice heard. We rely on our global workforce to uphold our Values, deliver our strategic priorities and work to sustain and improve short- and long-term performance. For AstraZeneca, 'global workforce' includes our full-time and part-time employees, fixed-term workers and external contractors working full- or part-time, anywhere in the world.\n\nThe Directors believe that the Board as a whole should be responsible for engaging with and understanding the views of the workforce. Consequently, the Board has chosen not to implement any of the three methods set out in the Code. Instead, it uses various mechanisms and long-standing communication channels in place across the Group that enable and facilitate engagement with the global workforce. These include the Board's review of the global workforce Pulse survey and the biannual Workforce Culture and Employee Engagement Report; Board members hosting 'townhall' meetings for the workforce, including Q&A sessions; and review of data relating to talent, development, inclusion and diversity initiatives, and online social media channels. Directors also visit our sites and carry out virtual engagements, which facilitate understanding of business operations and also provide opportunities for interactions between Directors and the workforce, including engagement with high-potential employees. Where required, issues or concerns raised by the workforce are fed back to management and discussed by the Board. Whenever relevant, the Board considers the views of the workforce and the potential impact on the workforce when it makes key decisions.\n\n## How the Board has regard for these matters:\n\n- > Considered that decisions should be made efficiently and at the appropriate level within the Company.\n- > Considered the results of a high-level benchmarking exercise carried out in respect of those FTSE 20 companies that publish this information.\n- > Considered the Group's total revenue, operating profits and net cash flow from operating activities which have increased significantly since the last review.\n- > Considered the governance implications of potential changes, particularly that the change would reduce the number of projects reviewed by the Science\n\nEngaging with the wider workforce can present challenges due to the size of the workforce and the global footprint, as well as the variety of roles throughout the organisation. In addition to in-person engagements, virtual engagements help to ensure that individual Directors, as well as Board and Board Committees, have the opportunity to meet with a range of employees from across the global workforce, and to hear and understand their views.\n\nThe Board believes that this alternative approach continues to be the best model of engagement for the Group and ensures that the Board has access to the views of the workforce regardless of location and provides meaningful information and data that the Board can use when considering the impact of strategic decisions on employees. Additionally, the chosen mechanisms allow all Directors to engage with a wider crosssection of the global workforce.\n\n## Workforce culture\n\nDuring 2023, the Board reviewed the biannual Workforce Culture and Employee Engagement Report, which demonstrated how our Values and behaviours are embedded throughout all levels of the workforce. The report contains a summary metric dashboard which is divided into categories reflecting AstraZeneca's Values and behaviours. Where the Board has concerns that the culture does not reflect our Values, the Board seeks assurances from management that remedial action has been taken and, where necessary, requests senior management's attendance at Board meetings to discuss corrective actions.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nof employees took part in the November 2023 Pulse survey.\n\n## 'Townhall' meetings, 'fireside chats' and 'Ask me anything' discussions\n\nBoth Non-Executive Directors and Executive Directors regularly participate in meetings with sites, or large groups of the workforce - either virtually or in person. These enable\n\nCommittee prior to Board approval.

During the year, among other events, the Board hosted in-person 'townhall' meetings for employees in Japan and US sites, which were also broadcast to other sites in the region to increase reach and participation.\n\n## Employee opinion surveys (Pulse)\n\nTwice a year, employees are invited to take part in an opinion survey, which seeks their views of the business. The results are reviewed by management and trends are monitored. The results are shared with the Board, which enables the Directors to understand the views and sentiments of the workforce.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nof employees stated they believe strongly in AstraZeneca's future direction and key priorities in the November 2023 Pulse survey.\n\n## Site visits\n\nDuring 2023, Directors visited various Group sites across the world, including those in India, Dubai, Japan, the US, the UK and the Alexion campus in Dublin, Ireland. The majority of visits were in person but, to maximise engagement opportunities, some were virtual, including those to the AstraZeneca businesses in the Nordics, Spain and Taiwan.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAstraZeneca Group sites around the world visited by Directors during 2023.\n\n## Wellbeing\n\nWhere appropriate - for example in relation to recent humanitarian events - the Board receives regular updates on the steps taken by management to create safe working environments and support the mental and physical wellbeing of the workforce.",

        "page_content": "## Corporate Governance Report Board performance evaluation\n\nAs part of the Board performance evaluation, Directors were asked to consider the following areas:\n\n- > Board composition\n- > Stakeholder oversight\n- > Board dynamics\n- > Board Committees\n- > Strategic oversight\n- > Risk oversight\n- > Succession planning and people oversight\n- > Priorities for change\n\n## 2023 overview\n\nThe UK Corporate Governance Code states that there should be an annual evaluation of the performance of the board, its committees, the chair and individual directors and that, for larger listed companies such as AstraZeneca, this should be externally-facilitated at least every three years. The Company was due to have an externally-facilitated evaluation in 2023.\n\nThe Board elected to postpone the externallyfacilitated review until 2024 and instead run an internal performance evaluation in 2023. This was considered to be a proportionate approach in light of the change in Chair during the year. Given the 27 April 2023 effective date of appointment of Michel Demar\u00e9 as Board Chair, the Board concluded that it would be a better use of time and resources for the next externally-facilitated annual performance review to take place in 2024, so that at least the first 12 to 18 months of the Board's work under the new Chair could be taken into account.\n\nThe internal evaluation was run via a webbased survey covering a wide range of topics that were broadly similar to topics from previous evaluations. A report was prepared using the answers to this survey which was discussed by the Board at its meeting in December 2023, and was used by the Chair as the basis for individual conversations with each Board member prior to the full Board discussion.\n\nAs part of each Director's individual discussion with the Chair during the Board evaluation, his or her contribution to the work of the Board and personal development needs were considered. Directors' training needs are met by a combination of: internal presentations and updates, and external speaker presentations, as part of Board and Board Committee meetings; specific training sessions on particular topics, where required; and the opportunity for Directors to attend external courses at the Company's expense, should they wish to do so.\n\nThe Nomination and Governance Committee also reviews the composition of the Board to ensure that it has the appropriate expertise, while also recognising the importance of diversity. For more information on the Nomination and Governance Committee's work, see the Nomination and Governance Committee Report from page 90.\n\n## 2023 outcomes and actions against prior year recommendations\n\n- > The Board continues to operate effectively with an atmosphere that enables candid discussion. Its relationship with management, including the CEO, CFO and SET, was highly rated.\n- > Each Director continues to perform effectively and demonstrate commitment to their role, as does the Chair (whose evaluation by Board members, absent the Chair, was led by the senior independent Non-Executive Director).\n- > The composition of the Board was highly rated.\n- > The Board has a good understanding of the views and requirements of its key stakeholders.\n- > All of the Board's Committees continue to operate effectively.\n- > The Board's contribution to strategy development, oversight of the R&D pipeline and effectiveness in monitoring and considering key external developments were highly rated. The Board oversees risk effectively.\n\nSuccession planning and people oversight continues to be a key area of focus. Key priorities for 2024 included strategy, financial performance and capital allocation, monitoring the R&D pipeline, market-specific and geopolitical issues, and Board and SET succession planning. To address areas highlighted by the 2022 annual Board performance evaluation, various steps were taken during 2023, including:\n\n- > The re-establishment - following the COVID-19 pandemic - of a strong programme of in-person Board meetings, including site visits, balanced with some Board meetings being held virtually to reduce the Board's carbon footprint and the need for Directors to undertake intercontinental travel.\n- > Focusing the Nomination and Governance Committee's work regarding Non-Executive Director succession planning on addressing the needs of the Board in the period to 2026, when four current Non-Executive Directors will reach nine years' tenure, with the appointment of Anna Manz in September 2023 being the first tangible outcome of this work.\n- > Continued routine work by the Nomination and Governance Committee to plan for future CEO succession, including reviews of both internal and external potential candidate options.\n- > Arranging a session to enable the Board to review how management was approaching drug pricing legislation in the US.",

The Committee ensures the Board has an appropriate balance of expertise, experience and diversity. A matrix that records the skills and experience of current Board members is one of the main tools used by the Committee to do this.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Nomination and Governance Committee's terms of reference are available on our website, www.astrazeneca.com.\n\nThe matrix is shown in the charts to the left.\n\nDecisions relating to the appointment of Directors are made by the entire Board based on the Committee's recommendations, taking into account the merits of the candidates and the relevance of their background and experience, measured against objective criteria, with care taken to ensure appointees have enough time to devote to the Board's business.\n\n## Board and Board Committee changes during the year\n\nFollowing the retirement of Leif Johansson from the Board at the end of the AGM on 27 April 2023, I was appointed Chair of the Board. In addition, I also assumed the role of Chair of this Committee. Further details about the Chair succession process are set out in the 2022 annual report.\n\nIn April, the Board appointed Euan Ashley as Chair of the Science Committee, in succession to Nazneen Rahman, effective 1 June 2023, with Nazneen remaining a member of the Science Committee. Euan was appointed as a member of the Nomination and Governance Committee, effective the same date. The Board appointed Nazneen Rahman as a member of the Remuneration Committee, effective 1 May 2023.\n\nIn May, the Board appointed Anna Manz as a Non-Executive Director and a member of the Audit Committee with effect from 1 September 2023. The appointment process was led by the Committee and involved Anna meeting with multiple Directors. Anna brings extensive cross-sector business skills and knowledge to the Board, having held international roles in North America and Asia-Pacific and served as an executive and non-executive in large, listed companies. Anna's significant financial and strategic leadership experience, including in areas such as risk, treasury and accounting, will enable her to fully contribute to the work of our Audit Committee.\n\n' The Nomination and Governance Committee works on behalf of the full Board to review the composition of the Board and its Committees and carry out succession planning for all Board positions.'\n\n## Nomination and Governance Committee members\n\n- > Michel Demar\u00e9 (Chair) (from 27 April 2023)\n- > Leif Johansson (Chair) (until 27 April 2023)\n- > Philip Broadley\n- > Sheri McCoy\n- > Nazneen Rahman\n- > Euan Ashley 1\n- 1 Appointed as a member of the Committee on 1 June 2023.\n\n## Inclusion and diversity\n\nThe Board views all aspects of diversity among Board members as important considerations when reviewing its composition. The Board also aims to maintain a balance in terms of the range of experience and skills of individual Board members, which includes relevant international business, pharmaceutical industry and financial experience, and appropriate scientific and regulatory knowledge. The biographies of Board members set out on pages 78 and 79 give more information about current Directors in this respect.\n\nThe Board has adopted an Inclusion and Diversity Policy (the Policy), which is applicable to the Board and its Committees. The Policy reinforces the Board's ongoing commitment to all aspects of diversity and to fostering an inclusive environment in which each Director feels valued and respected. Although the Board appoints candidates primarily based on merit and the relevance of their background and experience, measured against objective criteria, it recognises that an effective Board, with a broad strategic perspective, requires diversity. The Policy provides a commitment to use at least one professional search firm that has signed up to the 'Voluntary Code of Conduct for Executive Search Firms', to help recruit Directors from a broad, qualified group of candidates, to increase diversity of thinking and perspective. The Board's approach to inclusion and diversity continues to yield successful results.\n\nAs at 31 December 2023, 31% of the Company's full Board identifies as an ethnic minority, 45% of the Company's NonExecutive Directors are women, and women make up 46% of the full Board. The information presented in the following tables was collected on a self-reporting basis. The Board, SET and Company Secretary were provided with the prescribed table, and asked to complete based on how they identify. The Board is pleased that the Company meets the",

We were named 2nd ranking Healthcare company in the FTSE 100 for women on boards and in leadership in the FTSE Women Leaders Review. For the year ended 31 December 2023, following the retirement of Katarina Ageborg in January 2023 and Sharon Barr's appointment as Executive Vice-President, BioPharmaceuticals R&D in August 2023, women represented 43% of the SET and its leadership teams.\n\n## Ongoing training and development\n\nOn her appointment as an independent Non-Executive Director, Anna Manz commenced an ongoing tailored induction programme to provide an understanding of the Group and which reflects Anna's existing expertise and Committee membership. Key areas of the induction programme include:\n\n- > Meetings with members of the Board, SET and other senior management.\n- > Meeting with external legal advisers.\n- > Meeting with the external auditors.\n- > Access to a digital reading room which provides information on the Group, including financial performance, pipeline information, key Company policies, investor and analyst reports, media updates and guidance on directors' duties and listed company requirements.\n\nIn addition to arranging comprehensive induction programmes when new NonExecutive Directors are appointed to the Board, the Committee recognises the\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Board's Inclusion and Diversity Policy can be read in full on our website, www.astrazeneca.com.\n\nInformation about our approach to diversity in the organisation below Board level can be found in People, from page 45.\n\n## Table 1.

We are committed to developing a culture of lifelong learning throughout our organisation. Specific sessions with internal and external experts are periodically arranged for the full Board, to ensure that Directors have access to specialist knowledge across a broad range of areas to support their strategic decision making. For example, this year Board members participated in a roundtable event with key external experts in the areas of lung cancer and ATTR during the Board meeting in Tokyo, Japan to discuss the latest science and clinical research in those areas.\n\nAt least annually, I discuss with each Director his or her contribution to the work of the Board and personal development needs. Directors' training needs are met by: a combination of internal presentations and updates, and external speaker presentations, as part of Board and Board Committee meetings; specific training sessions on particular topics, where required; and the opportunity for Directors to attend external courses at the Company's expense, should they wish to do so. Directors are encouraged to visit the Group's sites, providing opportunities to meet local management and tour AstraZeneca facilities. Virtual visits are also arranged to allow further interactions with employees and sites. These visits further Directors' understanding of the Group's business and operations, as well as provide an insight into the particular challenges faced locally and opportunities to engage directly with employees and other stakeholders.\n\n## Succession planning\n\nThe Committee considers both planned and unplanned (unanticipated) succession scenarios. The Committee split the majority of its time on this topic in 2023 between succession planning for Non-Executive Directors, successfully concluding the recruitment of Anna Manz in September and continued routine succession planning for the role of CEO, which included desktop research relating to potential external candidates and reviewing the strengths and areas of development for potential internal candidates. Korn Ferry and Lygon Group assisted the Committee with its succession planning work this year. Korn Ferry undertakes executive search assignments for the Company but has no other connection with AstraZeneca or its individual Directors.\n\n## Corporate governance\n\nThe Committee advises the Board periodically on significant developments in corporate governance and the Company's compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code. Further information on our corporate governance arrangements, including the Company's statement of compliance with the Code during the year, is set out from page 81.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Michel Demar\u00e9\n\nChair of the Nomination and Governance Committee",

Our dialogue with AstraZeneca's R&D leaders and other scientist employees, as well as visits to our R&D sites throughout the world, allows us to review and assess:\n\n- > The approaches we adopt in respect of our chosen therapy areas.\n- > The scientific technology and R&D capabilities we deploy.\n- > The scientific strategy for maintaining our pipeline and competitiveness.\n- > The decision-making processes for R&D projects and programmes.\n- > The quality of our scientists, their career opportunities and talent development.\n- > Benchmarking against industry and scientific best practice, where appropriate.\n\nWe also periodically review important bioethical issues and assist in the formulation of appropriate policies in relation to such issues, agreeing these on behalf of the Board. The Committee also considers future trends in medical science and technology, and reviews, on behalf of the Board, the R&D aspects of specific business development or acquisition proposals, advising the Board on its conclusions.\n\n## Activities during the year\n\nThe Committee met nine times during 2023, both virtually and face to face. Our key areas of focus included:\n\n- > Company strategy and strategic priorities for R&D: including key prioritised science platforms across R&D (Oncology, BioPharmaceuticals and Rare Disease) and areas of focus for long-term success, including business development strategy and external trends impacting R&D investment.\n\n## Science Committee members\n\n- > Euan Ashley (Chair) (from 1 June 2023)\n- > Nazneen Rahman (Chair until 1 June 2023)\n- > Diana Layfield\n- > Tony Mok\n- > Marcus Wallenberg\n- > EVP, Oncology R&D 1\n- > EVP, BioPharmaceuticals R&D 1\n- > CEO, Alexion 1\n- 1 Co-opted member of the Committee.\n- > AstraZeneca R&D strategic science capabilities: including multi-omics and bioinformatics, and AI and computational strategies.

In addition, the Committee facilitated a deep dive session for the full Board focusing on developments in laws and regulations relating to sustainability reporting and progress against our Ambition Zero Carbon (AZC) targets and programmes. To enhance our understanding of the sustainability initiatives in action at AstraZeneca and hear colleagues' personal perspectives, the Committee invited employees to its meetings who were involved in workstreams and projects from across our sustainability strategy.

We also welcomed Anna Manz as a member of the Committee following her appointment to the Board in September. Anna brings wide-ranging, international experience from a number of industries, and has already begun to make effective contributions to the work of the Committee.\n\nThe Committee believes that it has carried out its responsibilities effectively throughout the year, and to a high standard, providing independent oversight. It has had good support from AstraZeneca personnel and PwC, the Company's auditors.\n\nThe Committee's main responsibilities include monitoring the integrity of /financial reporting and formal announcements relating to /financial performance, reviewing the effectiveness of internal controls and risk management systems, and overseeing the external and internal audit processes.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe full role of the Audit Committee is set out in its terms of reference, available at www.astrazeneca.com.\n\n' The Committee's main responsibilities include monitoring the integrity of financial reporting and formal announcements relating to financial performance, reviewing the effectiveness of internal controls and risk management systems, and overseeing the external and internal audit processes.'\n\nThe Committee continues to apply appropriate challenge to the Company's management; for example, the Committee challenged the timing of recognition of provisioning for certain legal items and their presentation as non-core items. This matter was subject to robust discussions and scrutiny from the Committee before it was satis/fied with management's approach.\n\nThe Committee's agenda continues to be driven by the Company's key active risks and key strategic programmes which are considered at every Committee meeting, and inform the Committee's agenda of in-depth sessions which, this year, have included sessions on:\n\n- > Our Operations function, as we continue to evolve our supply chain capabilities.\n- > Our IT/IS function, to gain a better understanding of how we seek to mitigate cybersecurity threats.\n- > The China market environment and healthcare industry trends, the enforcement environment, and how risks are being proactively managed.\n- > How the Company seeks to mitigate the impact of in/flationary pressures across the business.\n- > Organisational activities to support the Company's 2030 Bold Ambition.\n\nThese sessions allowed the Committee to continue exploring speci/fic aspects of risks in their 'real world' business contexts, in direct dialogue with people in the business that have responsibility for managing these risks.\n\n## Audit Committee members 1\n\n- > Philip Broadley (Chair)\n- > Michel Demar\u00e9 2\n- > Deborah DiSanzo\n- > Sheri McCoy\n- > Anna Manz 3\n- 2 Member of the Committee until 27 April 2023.\n- 3 Appointed as a member of the Committee on 1 September 2023.\n\nThe Committee also spent considerable time keeping ourselves updated on developments in the reporting and regulatory environment, including the proposed governance and audit reforms in the UK, SEC updated interpretations on non-GAAP measures reporting, and sustainability-related reporting.\n\nThis year, we continued our approach of a combination of in-person and virtual Committee meetings and interactions with colleagues from across the organisation. Of particular note this year were the Committee's in-person visits to AstraZeneca's manufacturing site in Speke, UK, and to the AstraZeneca and Alexion UK marketing companies. I also made in-person visits to the marketing companies in India and the Gulf Cooperation Cluster (GCC) in Dubai and a visit to the Global Innovation and Technology Centre in Chennai, India. These interactions, along with the in-depth sessions I refer to above, have allowed Committee members to maximise our engagement with colleagues across the business, deepen our understanding of the priorities and challenges facing many different markets and business areas, and hear a wide range of employees' views directly.\n\nWe hope you /find the Committee's Report useful and informative, and, as ever, I welcome any feedback.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Philip Broadley\n\nChair of the Audit Committee\n\n- 1 Routine attendees at Committee meetings include: the CFO; the Chief Human Resources Officer; Chief Compliance Officer and General Counsel; the VP, Ethics & Transparency and Deputy Chief Compliance Officer; the Deputy General Counsel, BioPharmaceuticals; the VP, Group Internal Audit; the SVP Finance, Group Controller & Head of Global Finance Services; and the Company's external auditor.

The Board determined that all members of the Committee are independent for the purposes of the Code and that the Committee members as a whole have competence relevant to the sector in which the Company operates, by virtue of their experience of working in science-driven, healthcare and/or pharmaceutical industries, or as a result of their tenure with AstraZeneca. The Committee members' quali/fications, skills and experience are detailed in their biographies on pages 78 and 79 and meeting attendance is shown on page 77.\n\n## Role of the Committee\n\nThe Committee's main responsibilities include monitoring the integrity of /financial reporting and formal announcements relating to /financial performance, reviewing the effectiveness of internal controls and risk management systems, and overseeing the external and internal audit processes. The Committee reports to the Board the principal matters it considers and any signi/ficant concerns it has or that have been reported to it. Further information about the Committee's role and work during the year is set out in this Audit Committee Report.\n\n## Activities during the year Financial reporting\n\nEffective internal controls, appropriate accounting practices and policies, and the exercise of experienced judgement by the Committee and the Board underpin AstraZeneca's /financial reporting integrity.\n\nThe Committee's activities in this area in 2023 included:\n\n- > Reviewing key elements of the Financial Statements and the estimates and judgements contained in the Group's /financial disclosures, as well as considering the appropriateness of management's and the external auditor's analysis and conclusions on judgemental accounting matters. The signi/ficant /financial reporting issues considered are described in detail in the table from page 98. Further information on the signi/ficant accounting matters considered is included in the Financial Review under Critical accounting policies and estimates from page 72 and within our Group Accounting Policies from page 152.\n- > Considering the completeness and accuracy of the Group's reported /financial performance against its internal and external key performance indicators.\n- > Reviewing the preparation of the Directors' Viability statement and considering the adequacy of the analysis supporting the assurance provided by that statement, as well as the going concern assessment and adoption of the going concern basis in preparing this Annual Report and the Financial Statements.\n- > Reviewing quarterly updates from both management and PwC on the programme of activities relating to control over /financial reporting and the effectiveness of testing that has been performed across the internal control environment.\n- > Considering the external auditor's reports on its audit of the Group Financial Statements, as well as reports from management, Group Internal Audit (GIA), Global Compliance and the external auditor on the effectiveness of our system of internal controls and, in particular, our internal control over /financial reporting. This included consideration of compliance with applicable provisions of the SarbanesOxley Act - in particular, the status of compliance with the programme of internal controls over /financial reporting implemented pursuant to section 404 of that Act.\n- > Discussing /financial reporting considerations in relation to signi/ficant transactions that occurred in the year, the valuation and presentation of the de/fined bene/fit pension arrangements, impairment of intangible assets, restructuring programmes and the presentation of collaboration and alliance revenues. The Committee also reviewed developments in sustainability reporting requirements and the Company's activities, governance frameworks and approach in compliance with enacted and emerging regulations in relation to sustainability.\n\n## Risk identification and management\n\nThe Committee continued its regular reviews of the Group's approach to risk management, the operation of its risk reporting framework and risk mitigation. This included consideration of the manner in which the risk management process was embedded in the Group such that the Committee could be assured that management's accountability for risks was clear and functioning effectively.\n\nThe Company's risk framework, described further from page 54, provides the context for the Committee to consider the Directors' Viability statement which is underpinned by the assurance provided through a 'stress test' analysis under which key pro/fitability, liquidity and funding metrics are tested against severe downside scenarios.\n\nEach of these scenarios assumes that the associated risks crystallise and that management will take mitigating actions against those risks. The Committee considered in detail the validity of each scenario. This included obtaining additional analysis from management as to the indirect or unintended consequences of its proposed mitigating actions including, for example, assessing the likely response of a broader range of stakeholders. The Committee also assessed whether the proposed mitigations were viable.\n\nThe Committee is updated on key active and emerging risks facing the Company through a quarterly risk management report from the CFO. The likelihood of each of the risks materialising and its potential impact was monitored by the Committee and the reports from the CFO enabled the Committee to track the trend applicable to each risk compared to the previous quarter. The composition and pro/file of these risks informs the Committee's agenda of in-depth sessions. For example, an upward trend, in terms of the likelihood and potential impact of the risk, was noted for the key active risk relating to IT, cyber risk and data security, therefore the Committee spent additional time with representatives from the IT function to understand those risks and the actions being undertaken to mitigate them.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMore information on the basis of preparation of Financial Statements on a going concern basis is set out on page 227 and in the Financial Statements on page 152.\n\nFurther information on the significant financial reporting issues considered is set out in the table from page 98.\n\nFurther information about the Principal Risks faced by the Group and the Viability statement is set out in Risk Overview from page 54.",

        "page_content": "## Audit Committee Report\n\n## continued\n\n## Cyber risk, digital security and information governance\n\nOur approach to identifying, assessing and managing material cybersecurity risks (including those that result from the use of third parties in business processes and data management) is integrated within our Group-wide approach to managing risk. Failure in information technology or cybersecurity has been identi/fied as a Principal Risk. Mitigations are in place to manage these risks, and these are monitored, and their effectiveness regularly reported, for example in KPI dashboards provided to management and the Committee. Incidents are managed and reported using the cybersecurity incident management framework which in turn is connected to the Group's crisis management framework. Cybersecurity risks are overseen by the Committee, who perform an in-depth review annually. Their reviews are supported by senior management, the VP, Group Internal Audit (GIA) and other assurance or providers as required. Cybersecurity risks (including previous incidents) have not materially affected our business strategy, results of operations or /financial condition.\n\n## Sustainability reporting and climate-related risk\n\nThe Committee is responsible for overseeing sustainability-related disclosures that are linked to the Financial Statements, which includes the TCFD Summary Statement and the EU Taxonomy disclosures in this Annual Report and the extended TCFD Statement published separately. These statements are also reviewed by the Sustainability Committee, to support the Committee's review.\n\nThe Committee received updates in the current year regarding the proposed and/or enacted regulations by the US, EU, UK and the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) on sustainability reporting, as well as the ongoing assessment of potential double materiality topics for the Company under EU regulations.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- For further information, see IT and IS resources on page 41.\n\nFor more information on our Code of Ethics, see page 49, and on Anti-bribery and anti-corruption, see page 39.\n\nAstraZeneca's Modern Slavery Act Statement is available on our website, www.astrazeneca.com.\n\n## Legal and Compliance\n\nThe Committee's activities in this area included reviewing:\n\n- > Quarterly reports from the Legal function to monitor the status of signi/ficant litigation matters and governmental investigations.\n- > Quarterly reports from Global Compliance to provide oversight of key compliance incidents (both substantiated and unsubstantiated), possible trends and the dispersion of incidents across our business functions and management hierarchy. The reports included corrective actions taken so that the Committee could assess the effectiveness of controls, and monitor and ensure timely remediation.\n- > Reporting on compliance with AstraZeneca's Code of Ethics to ensure high ethical standards and that AstraZeneca operates within the law in all countries where we operate.\n- > The monitoring, review, education and improvements made to support assurance that the risk of modern slavery and human traf/ficking is eliminated, to the fullest extent possible, from AstraZeneca's supply chain.\n\n## Internal Audit\n\nThe Committee reviewed GIA's activities, including:\n\n- > Reviewing quarterly reports of work carried out by GIA, including the status of follow-up actions with management. In 2023, GIA provided assurance over compliance with signi/ficant policies, plans, procedures, laws and regulations, as well as risk-based audits across a broad range of key business activities and continued its thematic reporting to the business. The 2023 audit plan was aligned to our key active risks and wider risk taxonomy. Separate meetings are arranged to discuss follow-up actions in more depth with speci/fic teams, when required by the Committee.\n- > Carrying out the annual effectiveness review of GIA in late 2023 by considering its performance against the internal audit plan and key activities.\n- > Approving the 2024 internal audit plan, which is aligned to our key active risks and wider risk taxonomy.\n- > Considering the geographic presence, reach and capabilities of GIA and the appropriateness of the Group's resource allocation for this vital assurance function.\n\nThe Committee noted the continued contributions of GIA in supporting and delivering value to the business and the Committee during the year. The Committee supports GIA's continued efforts to deploy its resources in line with the shape and size of the overall organisation and was satis/fied with the quality, experience and expertise of the GIA function.\n\nAn independent External Quality Assessment of GIA is performed every /five years and was last performed in 2021.\n\n## External audit\n\nThe Company's external auditor, PwC, provided quarterly reports to the Committee over key audit and accounting matters, and business processes, internal controls and IT systems.\n\nThe Committee oversaw the conduct, performance and quality of the external audit, in particular through its review and challenge of the coverage of the external auditor's audit plan and subsequent monitoring of progress against it. The Committee maintained regular contact with PwC through formal and informal reporting and discussion throughout the year, with a continued focus on maintaining audit ef/ficiency and quality. The Committee also sought management's feedback on the conduct of the audit and considered the level of and extent to which the auditors challenged management's assumptions. The Committee also received a formal letter and report from the Financial Reporting Council (FRC) following the joint FRC and Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) inspection of PwC's 2022 audit of AstraZeneca. The FRC's inspection was rated as 'Good' (the highest rating possible) and there were no 'Key' or 'Other' /findings. The FRC also recognised a number of areas of good practice in relation to the conduct of the audit.\n\nA number of interactions took place between Committee members and PwC during the year, outside of formal Committee meetings, to enhance the Committee's understanding of the audit process including the Committee Chair joining PwC's Account Planning Workshop to meet face-to-face with PwC team members responsible for auditing AstraZeneca's global entities.",

The Committee welcomes the opportunity to engage directly with employees in these meetings which provide an opportunity to gauge employee sentiment and hear their views directly. The Committee also uses these interactions to communicate the importance it attaches to compliance and our 'Speak Up' culture.\n\n## Reporting and regulatory environment\n\nThe Committee has kept abreast of developments in the reporting and regulatory environment. This has included consideration of the proposed governance and audit reforms in the UK, SEC updates on clawbacks and non-GAAP reporting, consultations on sustainability-related reporting requirements in a number of jurisdictions, and requirements to disclose further information about diversity and inclusion on company boards in the UK from 2023.\n\nThe Committee was also briefed on thematic reviews published by the FRC during the year, including those on fair-value-measurement and climate-related metrics and targets.\n\nEnsuring the quality of external /financial reporting to shareholders and other stakeholders remains paramount to the Committee. This includes its assessment of the annual reports to ensure that, taken as a whole, they are fair, balanced and understandable (for which the process is described on page 100). External validation of the Annual Report is an important indicator of the quality of our reporting. The Committee was pleased with the feedback from the FRC that it received in 2023 on the 2022 Annual Report:\n\n- > The FRC undertook a routine corporate reporting review of the 2022 Annual Report and did not raise any questions or queries that required further correspondence, which the Committee consider a re/flection of the quality /financial reporting and compliance undertaken by AstraZeneca. The FRC highlighted some areas where reporting could be further enhanced which management and the Committee have considered in preparing this Annual Report.\n- > The FRC also reviewed our reporting in the context of the 2018 UK Corporate Governance Code and raised no signi/ficant points in this respect.\n- > In the FRC's 2022/2023 Annual Review of Corporate Governance Reporting, the FRC highlighted the following aspects of the 2022 Annual Report as examples of best practice: (i) how the impact of AstraZeneca's learning culture contributed positively to retention and promotion rates and more accurate succession planning; and (ii) how AstraZeneca's strategy and KPIs in relation to scienti/fic measures are linked to remuneration.\n- > The FRC Lab's report on business model-focused reporting highlighted our 'Life-cycle of a medicine' text and diagram in the 2022 Annual Report (an updated version of which appears on page 11 of this Annual Report) as a best practice example of how an issuer can better meet investor needs, particularly for a reader who is not a pharmaceutical expert.\n\n## Committee performance\n\nThe Committee conducted the annual evaluation of its own performance, referring to the Committee-speci/fic results of a Board performance review survey prepared by the Company Secretary's team. The results were reported to and discussed with the Committee and the Board. The overall results of the survey were positive and noted the Committee's efforts and focus.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFurther information about the audit and non-audit fees for 2023 is disclosed in Note 31 to the Financial Statements on page 210.",

The Committee reviewed the Company's governance structure and assurance mechanisms for the preparation of this Annual Report and, in particular, the contributor and SET member veri/fication process. The Committee received an early draft of this Annual Report to review its proposed content and the structural changes from the prior year and to undertake a review of the reporting for the year, following which the Committee members provided their individual and collective feedback. In addition, in accordance with its terms of reference, the Committee (alongside the Board) took an active part in reviewing the Company's quarterly announcements and considered the Company's other public disclosures which are managed through its Disclosure Committee (the Committee was updated on matters considered by the Disclosure Committee regularly throughout the year). To aid its review further, the Committee also received a summary of the /final Annual Report's content, including AstraZeneca's successes and setbacks during the year and an indication of where they were disclosed within the document.\n\nThe processes described above allowed the Committee to provide assurance to the Board to assist it in making the statement required of it under the Code, which is set out from page 81.\n\n## Internal controls\n\nInformation on the Company's internal controls is included in the Audit, risk and internal control section in the Corporate Governance Report on page 82. During the period covered by this Annual Report there was no change in our internal control over /financial reporting that occurred that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over /financial reporting.\n\nAt the January 2024 Committee meeting, the CFO presented the conclusions of the evaluation by the CEO and CFO of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures that is required by Item 15(a) of Form 20-F as at 31 December 2023. Based on their evaluation, the CEO and the CFO concluded that, as at that date, the Company maintained an effective system of disclosure controls and procedures.\n\n## External auditor\n\nPwC is the Company's external auditor. In April 2023, PwC was reappointed as the Company's auditor for the /financial year ended 31 December 2023, its seventh consecutive year as auditor, having /first been appointed for the /financial year ended 31 December 2017, following a competitive tender carried out in 2015. Sarah Quinn continued as the lead audit partner at PwC for 2023 following her appointment in January 2022.\n\n## Audit, audit-related and other assurance services provided by the external auditor\n\nThe Committee maintains the Audit and Audit-Related Services Approval Policy (the Policy) for the pre-approval of all audit services, audit-related services and other assurance services undertaken by the external auditor. The principal purpose of the Policy is to ensure that the independence of the external auditor is not impaired.\n\nThe pre-approval procedures permit certain audit and audit-related services to be performed by the external auditor, subject to annual fee limits agreed with the Committee in advance. Pre-approved audit and audit-related services below the clearly trivial threshold (within the overall annual fee limit) are subject to case-by-case approval by the SVP Finance, Group Controller & Head of Global Finance Services.\n\nPre-approved audit services included services in respect of the annual /financial statement audit (including quarterly and half-year reviews), attestation opinion under section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, statutory audits for subsidiary entities, and other procedures to be performed by the independent auditor in order to form an opinion on the Group's Consolidated Financial Statements. The pre-approved audit-related services, which the Committee believes are services reasonably related to the performance of the audit or review of the Company's Financial Statements, included certain services required by law or regulation, such as /financial statement audits of employee bene/fit plans and capital market transactions. The Policy prohibits any tax services. Audit-related services included the assurance in relation to tax regulatory certi/ficates required to be issued by the external auditor.\n\nThe CFO (supported by the SVP Finance, Group Controller & Head of Global Finance Services), monitors the status of all services being provided by the external auditor. Authority to approve work exceeding the pre-agreed annual fee limits and for any individual service above the clearly trivial threshold is delegated to the Chair of the Committee together with one other Committee member in the /first instance. A standing agenda item at Committee meetings covers the operation of the pre-approval procedures and regular reports are provided to the full Committee.\n\nAll services other than the pre-approved audit and audit-related services, require approval by the Committee on a case-by-case basis. In 2023, PwC provided audit services including interim reviews of the results of the Group for the period ended 30 June 2023 and audit-related and other assurance services.\n\nThe increase to the statutory audit fee for 2023 is largely driven by in/flationary increases.\n\nFees for audit-related and other assurance services amounted to 6% of the fees payable to PwC for audit services in 2023 (2022: 4%). The Committee is mindful of the 70% non-audit services fee cap under EU regulation, together with the overall proportion of fees for audit and audit-related services in determining whether to pre-approve such services. Fees for audit-related and other assurance services payable to PwC in 2023 were 7% (2022: 6%) of average audit fees over 2020 to 2022 (2022: 2019 to 2021).\n\nPwC were better placed than any alternative provider to provide these services in terms of their familiarity with the Company's business, skills, capability and ef/ficiency with which they could deliver the relevant services. All such services were either within the scope of the pre-approved services set out in the Policy or were presented to Committee members for pre-approval and all such services were permitted by the FRC Ethical Standard.",

The Committee assessed PwC's effectiveness principally against four key factors, namely: judgement; mindset and culture; skills, character and knowledge; and quality control. As part of that assessment, it also took account of the views of senior management within the Finance function and regular Committee attendees.\n\nAs part of the Committee's assessment of the quality of the audit, the Committee focused on the auditor's effective use of experts and technology as well as appropriate challenge of management's judgements especially in relation to areas of signi/ficant /financial reporting issues (as described in the table from page 98). Areas that were reviewed by the Committee included PwC's extensive and detailed review of the valuations and assumptions related to de/fined bene/fit pension valuations and the UK group company intragroup purchase of certain IP, assumptions and calculations over Gross to Net Product Sales, legal settlements in the year, intangible asset assumptions used in cash/flow modelling, and the recognition and measurement of uncertain tax liabilities.\n\nThe Committee concluded that the PwC audit was effective for the /financial year ended 31 December 2023. In February 2024, the Committee recommended to the Board the reappointment of PwC as the Company's auditor for the /financial year ending 31 December 2024. Accordingly, a resolution to reappoint PwC as auditor will be put to shareholders at the Company's AGM in April 2024.\n\nIn order to comply with UK legal requirements regarding the auditor's tenure and audit tendering, the external audit must be put out to tender before the 2027 /financial year. In late 2023, the Committee decided to commence the tender process for the audit mandate for the 2027 /financial year. This will ensure suf/ficient time to carry out the process and, in the event that a new auditor is appointed, clear any con/flicts and ensure a new auditor builds up the necessary knowledge and business familiarity to ensure the delivery of an effective audit. PwC is eligible to re-tender for the audit and has indicated its willingness to be one of the /firms included in the tender. The Committee will lead the tender process and has approved an inclusive, competitive and transparent process by which the tender will be conducted to determine a high-quality audit delivery provider.\n\n## Regulation\n\nThe Committee considers that the Company has complied with the Competition and Markets Authority's Statutory Audit Services for Large Companies Market Investigation (Mandatory Use of Competitive Tender Processes and Audit Committee Responsibilities) Order 2014 in respect of its /financial year commencing 1 January 2023.",

Since launch, significant progress has already been made towards delivering on our stretching target of 15 new medicines by 2030, including the approvals of Truqap, Wainua and Airsupra . With strong revenue growth in 2023 and over 30 Phase III clinical trials underway (10 of these expected to have blockbuster potential), it is clear that AstraZeneca's remarkable performance trajectory is set to continue to deliver value to shareholders in the years to come.\n\n## Key Committee activities in 2023\n\nThe Committee was pleased to have received a high degree of support for the 2022 Directors' Remuneration Report, with a 94% vote in favour at the Company's 2023 AGM.\n\nAn important area of focus for the Committee this year has been reviewing the current Directors' Remuneration Policy (the Policy), which is required to be put to shareholders at the 2024 AGM.\n\nIn the period since our Policy was last approved in 2021, we are proud that AstraZeneca has continued to grow and prosper under our CEO's leadership delivering excellent returns for shareholders, and consistently positioned first or second in the FTSE 100, materially larger in size than other UK listed companies. As a major global organisation, operating within the highly competitive global pharmaceuticals sector, the Committee is very aware of the challenges of providing competitive executive remuneration which balances the genuine pay pressures from a talent market heavily influenced by US practice, and the expectations of UK investors and the corporate governance environment.\n\n## Remuneration Committee members\n\n- > Sheri McCoy (Chair)\n- > Philip Broadley\n- > Michel Demar\u00e9\n- > Leif Johansson 1\n- > Nazneen Rahman 2\n- 1 Retired from the Board on 27 April 2023.\n- 2 Appointed as a member of the Committee on 1 May 2023.\n\nDuring 2023, I spent time meeting with investors who hold over 50% of the Company's issued share capital to discuss the Committee's proposals for the 2024 Policy. The valuable feedback received was discussed with the Committee, and was factored into the Committee's consideration of both executive remuneration in 2024 and the Policy which will be put to shareholders for approval at the 2024 AGM. The new proposals are summarised later in this letter, and our new Policy can be found from page 127.\n\nAstraZeneca has a well-established high performance culture, and we are committed to delivering and rewarding excellent performance. Over the year, the Committee has worked closely with its independent advisor and the Audit, Science and Sustainability Committees to ensure that the financial, science and ESG measures in our incentive plans are appropriate, suitably stretching and accurately assessed in order to enable the Company to achieve the 2030 Bold Ambition and Growth Through Innovation strategy.\n\nIn addition to overseeing the reward arrangements in relation to our Senior Executive Team (SET), including those for the appointment of Sharon Barr as EVP, BioPharmaceuticals R&D, we continue to look further into total reward of the wider workforce and are supportive of the Company's efforts to ensure reward decisions are equitable by career level, geography and gender. The Committee is pleased that 35% of the employee population are eligible to participate in AstraZeneca share plans so that employees can share in the Company's performance and align with the experience of shareholders. We are proud that AstraZeneca remains committed to paying a living wage for all employees globally.",

The scientific progress is essential for our patients who stand to benefit from our medicines and we are delighted that not only did we deliver 30 pipeline progression events, either NME Phase II starts or Phase III investment decisions, but we were also able to exceed our goal for regulatory events by delivering 46 over the year. AstraZeneca also continued to invest for the future and build our scientific leadership, with highlights including the agreement with Quell Therapeutics and proposed acquisition of Gracell Biotechnologies to advance cell therapies across oncology and autoimmune diseases and the new licensing agreement with Eccogene for a novel once daily oral GLP1RA, adding an exciting early asset with potential as a next-generation treatment for cardiometabolic diseases, diabetes and obesity to the CVRM portfolio.\n\n## Growth and Therapy Area Leadership:\n\nIn 2023, the commercial and regulatory teams have made great progress driving a 3% (constant exchange rate (CER): 6%) growth in Total Revenue, despite a decline of $3,736 million from COVID-19 medicines. Excluding COVID-19 medicines, Total Revenue increased by 13% (CER: 15%). Oncology Total Revenue increased by 19% (CER: 21%) to $18,447 million following approvals of Imfinzi for biliary tract cancer and Imfinzi plus Imjudo for liver and lung cancers. Tagrisso , Imfinzi , Lynparza and Calquence were once again all stand out performers. Within BioPharmaceuticals, there was strong growth in all non-COVID-19 therapy areas. CVRM Total Revenue was up 15% (CER: 18%) to $10,628 million driven by Forxiga , Lokelma , roxadustat and Andexxa . Respiratory & Immunology Total Revenue was $6,404 million, an increase of 7% (CER: 10%). Rare Disease Total Revenue grew by 10% (CER: 12%) to $7,764 million, largely driven by Ultomiris (up 51% (CER: 52%)), along with marked contribution from Strensiq , Koselugo and Kanuma as they expand into new markets.\n\nPeople and Sustainability: We continue to strive to be a great place to work. We have continued to invest in developing our leaders and nurturing a culture of lifelong learning. In 2023, over 11,000 employees have participated in an immersive development experience and over 1.2 million self-guided learning modules have been completed in our learning platform Degreed. Inclusion and diversity remains an important priority; in 2023 the Company has focused on embedding equity into our talent processes, building inclusive leadership capabilities and engaging our global workforce through quarterly Power of Diversity programming, such as our spotlight on building cultural intelligence.

Our ground-breaking partnership to deliver renewable natural gas to our US research and manufacturing sites will provide a source of clean heat which will contribute to our science-based target of reducing Scope 1 and 2 emissions (operations and fleet) by 98% by 2026, whilst also contributing to the circular economy. We celebrated AstraZeneca being ranked number 1 among pharmaceutical companies for climate action in a new STAT Report, and we were proud of our strong presence at Climate Week and the UN General Assembly as we continued to drive change at scale.\n\n## 2023 remuneration outcome\n\nThe Committee always seeks to ensure that the remuneration of our Executive Directors and our wider workforce reflects the underlying performance of the business. When approving outcomes, we therefore considered the Group scorecard along with wider business and\n\nindividual performance over 2023, including other achievements across the enterprise, such as advancing our People and Sustainability priorities. In that context, the Committee believes that the payments outlined below fairly reflect their performance.\n\n## Annual bonus - 79.5% of maximum\n\nWhen determining bonus outturns, the Committee considered the formulaic outcome from the Group scorecard along with wider business and individual impact and performance in 2023, including ESG achievements. The Committee determined to award an annual bonus equivalent to 79.5% of maximum to Mr Soriot and Dr Sarin (equivalent to 198.75% and 159% of base pay respectively), in line with the Group scorecard outcome. Details of the factors considered to determine the bonuses are provided from page 111.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMore information on the TSR peer groups for PSP awards can be found on page 115.\n\nFurther detail of 2023 commercial and scientific performance can be found in the Strategic Report from page 12.",

The new Policy is intended to remain in effect for three years from the date of the AGM.\n\nDuring 2023, the Committee reviewed the Policy to ensure that it continues to be aligned with corporate governance best practice and promotes the delivery of long-term shareholder value. In shaping the new Policy, we have taken into account the perspectives of shareholders gathered from consultation undertaken during 2023. I met 26 of AstraZeneca's largest shareholders and three proxy advisors to discuss our proposals, and was pleased with the level of engagement, feedback and support received.\n\nThe purpose of the new Policy is to:\n\n- > Incentivise the delivery of the Company's 2030 Bold Ambition and Growth Through Innovation strategy.\n- > Continue to emphasise the importance the Committee places on performancerelated pay.\n- > Retain and motivate incumbent Executive Directors to deliver against our strategy.\n- > Ensure that sufficient headroom exists to deliver market competitive performance based reward to our executives and down through the organisation.\n\nIn developing the new Policy proposals, the Committee noted that AstraZeneca has changed and grown significantly since the introduction of the 2021 Policy. The Company is more complex, with the integration of Alexion and the addition of successful new therapy areas in Rare Diseases and Vaccines & Immune Therapies. TSR of 40% has been delivered in this period, and Total Revenue has increased from $26.6 billion in 2020 to $45.8 billion at the end of 2023.\n\nWe face increasing external talent market pressure as our employees are rightly viewed as\n\n| Achieved 2023 Annual bonus scorecard performance 1   | Achieved 2023 Annual bonus scorecard performance 1                       | Achieved 2023 Annual bonus scorecard performance 1   | Achieved 2023 Annual bonus scorecard performance 1   | Achieved 2023 Annual bonus scorecard performance 1   |\n|------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|\n|                                                      | Science and Innovation: Annual pipeline progression                      | 85%                                                  |                                                      | 87%                                                  |\n|                                                      | Achieve Group Financial Targets                                          |                                                      |                                                      |                                                      |\n| 2021 PSP performance                                 |                                                                          |                                                      |                                                      |                                                      |\n|                                                      | Growth and Therapy Area Leadership                                       |                                                      | 71%  Achieved                                        |                                                      |\n|                                                      | Science and Innovation: First approvals and NME volume  over three years | 90%                                                  | 90%                                                  | 90%                                                  |\n|                                                      | Growth and Therapy Area Leadership                                       | 100%                                                 | 100%                                                 | 100%                                                 |\n|                                                      | Achieve Group Financial Targets                                          | 88%                                                  | 88%                                                  | 88%                                                  |\n|                                                      | Relative TSR                                                             | 68%                                                  | 68%                                                  | 68%                                                  |\n|                                                      | Ambition Zero Carbon (AZC)                                               | 100%                                                 | 100%                                                 | 100%                                                 |\n|                                                      |                                                                          | Achieved                                             |                                                      |                                                      |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 1 When determining bonus outturns, the Committee considered the formulaic outcome from the Group scorecard along with wider business and individual impact and performance in 2023, including ESG achievements.\n\nmarket-leading talent. Notably, we experience pay compression challenges under the 2021 Policy, which does not provide sufficient headroom to deploy appropriately leveraged pay for performance compensation across our most senior leadership levels. Independent benchmarking of reward demonstrates that our current remuneration policy risks limiting our ability to compete for key roles below the Board, with heads of R&D being the most highly compensated roles in the industry below CEO level. 40% of our senior leaders are based in the US and over 40% of our revenue derives from the US. The Committee is acutely aware that we must be able to compete for the best talent in the US market.\n\nThe Committee recognises that US pay practices differ from the UK, and in particular that US companies may offer a combination of time-based restricted stock, performancebased stock, and sometimes market value options to executive directors. At AstraZeneca we firmly believe that executive pay should be clearly aligned to performance and therefore we are not proposing to alter the design of our incentive plans (annual bonus and PSP) in principle. However, in order to address the challenges of pay compression, and to provide a more competitive package for senior executives, we are proposing an increase to the maximum total incentive opportunity under our Policy, as set out below. The recommended changes will be accompanied by the Committee's continued commitment to setting stretching targets, aligning to the delivery of the 2030 Bold Ambition.\n\nI believe that the proposed Policy reflects our current market position but, more importantly, should set us up for success over the next\n\nthree-year cycle of the Policy. It will further engage our executive leadership in the conversion of the strength of our pipeline to commercial success, delivering industry-leading growth and our ambition of launching 15 new medicines by 2030 off the back of our planned material financial investment in future pipeline and partnerships. The importance of retaining and motivating our incumbent Executive Directors and senior leadership team in order to drive our 2030 Bold Ambition has been a key theme in consultation discussions with our shareholders. We seek to be competitive with comparable European pharma market peers and our proposals aim to reflect the performance, market capitalisation and future ambition of the Company in that context.\n\nProposed changes to the Policy and how it will be implemented are summarised below and in more detail on page 127. The Policy is set out from page 128. The Committee would like to highlight that the key proposed changes are strictly linked to performance-related pay.\n\n- > No Policy changes are proposed in relation to base pay increases (which will not exceed the average of the relevant wider workforce) or pension arrangements (which are already in line with the relevant wider workforce).\n- > We propose to increase the target annual bonus opportunity for the CEO, Mr Soriot, to 150% of base pay, resulting in a new maximum bonus of 300% of base pay (currently 250%), in line with the median target bonus opportunity of his global peer group.\n- > Target annual bonus for the CFO, Dr Sarin, remains unchanged at 100% of base pay, with a maximum bonus opportunity of 200% of base pay.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "- > Half of any earned bonus will be deferred into shares for three years.\n- > For awards under the PSP our proposal is to increase the maximum award under the Policy to 850% of base pay from the current 650%, subject to appropriately stretching performance targets. This new maximum would apply to Mr Soriot in 2024 provided that it is approved by shareholders.\n- > Dr Sarin's 2024 PSP opportunity would increase to 550% of base pay (from 450%).\n- > At the same time, in light of feedback received from investors, the minimum shareholding requirement for each of our Executive Directors will increase to match their maximum variable pay opportunity, being 1,150% base pay for Mr Soriot, and 750% base pay for Dr Sarin.\n\nThe Committee recognises that these proposals are material if viewed in a UK context. However, the changes are necessary to increase the competitiveness of the performance-related pay opportunity in the context of the global and European pharma market. Given the size, complexity and global reach of AstraZeneca, the Committee does not consider the constituents of the FTSE 100 to be an appropriate group against which to benchmark remuneration. Our approach is to\n\nlook at remuneration opportunity amongst the European and global pharma peers with whom we compete for talent and compare performance and to determine a Policy which is highly weighted towards pay for performance. The charts below show our Executive Directors' on-target and maximum opportunity relative to our defined comparator groups. Our proposed changes will bring Mr Soriot to the lower quartile of our global peer group, but will better reflect AstraZeneca's relative position within the European peer group, moving up one position in the global and European rankings for target compensation and two positions at maximum (due to the higher proportion of pay at risk compared with peers). The increased PSP opportunity for Dr Sarin will bring her compensation into line with the global median of her peers. The importance of being able to offer our impactful and talented CEO a competitive remuneration package, has been a key area of interest raised by shareholders in consultation discussions.\n\nThe Committee is not proposing to make any changes to the choice of performance metrics and their weightings for the Annual bonus or the PSP in 2024, as feedback from our shareholders is that the metrics successfully\n\n## Market positioning of Executive Directors' on-target remuneration\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGlobal pharma peers\u00b9\n\nEuropean pharma peers\u00b2\n\n## CEO\n\nGlobal pharma peers\u00b9\n\nEuropean pharma peers\u00b2\n\nCFO\n\n## Market positioning of Executive Directors' maximum remuneration\n\nGlobal pharma peers\u00b9\n\nEuropean pharma peers\u00b2\n\n## CEO\n\nGlobal pharma peers\u00b9\n\nEuropean pharma peers\u00b2\n\nCFO\n\nLower quartile to median\n\nMedian to upper quartile\n\n\u00a38.97m\n\n\u00a36.62m\n\n\u00a316.51m\n\n\u00a310.20m\n\n\u00a34.15m\n\n\u00a34.66m\n\n\u00a33.61m\n\n\u00a35.73m\n\n\u00a310.38m\n\n\u00a328.43m\n\n\u00a315.05m\n\n\u00a313.91m\n\n\u00a36.56m\n\n\u00a37.83m\n\n\u00a36.29m\n\n\u00a39.49m\n\n- Current position\n- 2024 proposal\n- 1 Global pharma peer group consists of: AbbVie, Amgen, BMS, Eli Lilly, Gilead, GSK, Johnson & Johnson, Merck, Novartis, Novo Nordisk, Pfizer, Roche and Sanofi (CEO only).\n- 2 European pharma peer group consists of: Bayer, GSK, Merck KGaA, Novartis, Novo Nordisk, Roche and Sanofi (CEO only).\n\nRemuneration includes base pay, target annual bonus and the expected value of LTI awards.

Given the proposed increase in quantum, the Committee has rigorously reviewed the stretch in performance targets for 2024 to ensure they are appropriate and commensurate with delivery of excellent shareholder value.\n\nThe Board considers that the proposed changes will enable our remuneration framework to be more competitive as we focus on the delivery of our 2030 Bold Ambition for our patients and shareholders. The emphasis on performance-related pay ensures that outcomes are fully aligned with shareholder interests as we address the need to attract and retain outstanding talent.\n\nThe Committee took shareholders' feedback into account on the proposed changes to the Policy, and we would like to take this opportunity to thank all those who took part for their constructive engagement and support for our proposals.\n\n## Non-Executive Directors' fees\n\nWith effect from January 2024, certain of the Non-Executive Directors' fees have been increased. This reflects the continuing increase in workload and responsibilities of non-executive directors of large, global, complex, publicly listed companies, including the importance of the Science Committee and the Sustainability Committee to the Board's work and the workloads of these Committees. AstraZeneca Non-Executive Directors' fees have not been increased since January 2022. No Board member participated in any decisions relating to their own fees. Further detail is provided on page 118.\n\n## Next steps\n\nI hope that you find this Remuneration Report clear in explaining the 2024 Policy proposals and the implementation of our Policy during 2023. We trust that we have provided the information you need to be able to support the resolution to be put to shareholders on the new Policy and this Remuneration Report at the Company's AGM in April 2024.\n\nOur ongoing dialogue with shareholders and other stakeholders is valued greatly and, as always, we welcome your feedback on this Directors' Remuneration Report.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Sheri McCoy\n\nChair of the Remuneration Committee",

Outcomes are calculated based on performance against each weighted metric. Each performance measure is assessed on a standalone basis, so that underperformance against one measure cannot be compensated for by overperformance against another. Data for the metrics is taken from the Group's financial reports which are reviewed by the Audit Committee and approved by the Board.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor annual bonus, the fairness of the formulaic Group scorecard outcome is considered in the context of overall business performance and the experience of shareholders. Such considerations include TSR performance and each Executive Director's personal impact on the delivery of the strategy, wider ESG performance and other organisational achievements, such as inclusion and diversity targets and the realisation of technology-based milestones. Each year, there are important individual deliverables beyond the scorecard metrics which are taken into account when determining individual bonuses.\n\nScience targets are based on a cohort of scientific opportunities specified at the start of the performance period. Opportunities represent potential achievements through the pipeline, from an early stage where our scientists work to discover new molecules, through to ultimately obtaining approvals and getting new medicines to patients. Rewarding success at each stage recognises the importance of creating and maintaining a long-term sustainable pipeline. Stretch of proposed targets is reviewed by the Science Committee taking into account factors such as the expected net present value of the pipeline and the anticipated financial contribution it will make, past performance, the external regulatory environment, and internal resourcing and efficiencies. Targets for realisation of these opportunities are ambitious. The outlook for the delivery of the pipeline is increasingly challenging given the rising proportion of new modalities and innovation, representing previously untested science.\n\nProposed targets for the Ambition Zero Carbon measure are reviewed and endorsed by the Sustainability Committee and exceed the 1.5\u00b0C Paris Agreement glide path. Our decarbonisation ambitions are increasingly challenging to deliver in the context of broader enterprise growth, particularly the higher supply volumes required to fulfil demand for our medicines.\n\nThe Committee thoroughly reviews and challenges targets proposed by management, working in partnership with the Science and Sustainability Committees to ensure targets are stretching and robust.\n\nThe Committee is provided with considerable supporting material for each metric and receives briefings from senior leaders across AstraZeneca. The science measures are reviewed and endorsed by the Science Committee, with a focus on ensuring that the targets will result in long-term sustainable value creation, and the Committee reviews and approves the full cohort of opportunities. The ESG metric within the PSP is aligned to our Ambition Zero Carbon goal and reflects the importance of eliminating GHG emissions in our Scope 1 and Scope 2 operations through 2025.\n\nFinancial Targets metrics align with the Company's Mid-Term Plan (MTP), which sets out the financial framework for delivering our ambitious strategy over a three-year period. The MTP process includes detailed business reviews, during which plans and efficiencies of each unit are challenged, leading to a proposed MTP for the Board to review and challenge. The Committee sets targets based on the Board-approved MTP, considering consensus expectations, independent analytics and anticipated challenges and opportunities. Whilst Total Revenue and Core EPS targets are set at budget exchange rates at the beginning of the performance period and evaluated at those rates at the end of the performance period (so that any beneficial or adverse movements in currency do not impact reward outcomes), the Committee also compares targets against prior plans at constant exchange rates, to ensure that new targets incentivise ambitious levels of growth. Where consensus figures do not align with internal forecasts, the Committee seeks to understand why a difference exists (such as differences in assumed capital expenditure). This range of data is used by the Committee to ensure the stretching nature of performance targets is robustly tested. Additionally, the PSP TSR measure is designed to reward strong performance relative to our peers.\n\nThe Ambition Zero Carbon metric has been reviewed and endorsed by our Sustainability Committee.\n\nCommittee members participate in the full Board discussions on the strategy, MTP and budget, which form the basis for the targets. The Committee considers how proposed financial targets align with the MTP and budget; prior years' outcomes (in absolute terms and against target); how the ambition has changed from the prior MTP and budget; external guidance the Company has provided or plans to give; consensus from external financial analysts and factors it may be impacted by; and the underlying assumptions. Statistical analysis conducted by the Committee's independent adviser is also used to assess the proposals. This includes an assessment of historical levels of performance volatility.\n\nThe Science Committee independently considers and informs the Committee whether science achievements represent a fair and balanced outcome, reflecting genuine achievements and pipeline progression. Ambition Zero Carbon outcomes are validated by the Sustainability Committee. Apart from Cash flow, which is set at actual rates of exchange, financial metrics are set at budget rates of exchange and evaluated at those rates at year end, which means they are not directly comparable year-on-year. The Committee is, however, provided with data to allow it to conduct year-on-year analyses.\n\nHaving considered the Group scorecard outcome, overall business performance, the experience of shareholders and individual performance, as detailed from page 112, the Committee carefully determines a final bonus outcome for each Executive Director that is considered fair and appropriate for the year's performance, and is in the best interests of shareholders.",

The increase to current Executive Directors' base pay for 2024 will increase in line with the UK all-employee base pay increase budget at 4%.\n\n## Taxable bene/fits\n\nThe totals within taxable bene/fits include the CEO's allowance under AstraZeneca's UK Flexible Bene/fits Programme, under which he can select bene/fits or take his allowance, or any proportion remaining after the selection of bene/fits, in cash (\u00a3115,660 taken as cash). The value of personal tax advice provided to each Executive Director in 2023 was \u00a318,687 and \u00a345,120 for the CEO and CFO respectively.\n\n## Pension\n\nThe Executive Directors receive a pension allowance of 11% of base pay, in line with the wider UK workforce. During 2023, the Executive Directors took their pension allowance as a cash alternative to participation in a de/fined contribution pension scheme. Neither of the Executive Directors has a prospective entitlement to a de/fined bene/fit pension by reason of qualifying service.\n\n## Annual bonus\n\n## 2023 Annual bonus\n\nAnnual bonuses earned in respect of performance during 2023 are included in the realised pay table.\n\nDetailed information on the Committee's approach to target setting and assessment of performance is set out from page 112.\n\nHalf of the Executive Directors' pre-tax bonus is compulsorily deferred into Ordinary Shares which are released three years from the date of deferral.

Each metric within the scorecard is assessed on a standalone basis and has a de/fined payout range.\n\nPerformance below the speci/fied threshold level for a metric will result in 0% payout for that metric. 100% of target bonus will pay out for on-target performance, and 200% of target bonus will pay out for performance at or above maximum. Performance between threshold and maximum is assessed on a pro rata basis. Maximum bonus payouts for the CEO and CFO for 2023 were capped at 250% and 200% of base pay respectively. The payout range for each metric is capped in line with each Executive Director's maximum bonus opportunity to ensure underperformance against one metric cannot be compensated for by overachievement against another. The table below shows the scorecard formulaic outcomes for the CEO and CFO as a percentage of target bonus.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| 2023 Group scorecard performance measures and metrics   | Weighting                                           | Threshold   (0% payout)   | Threshold   (0% payout)   | Target   (100% payout)   | Maximum  (200% payout)   | Outcome   | Formulaic outcome  (% of target bonus)   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|-----------|------------------------------------------|\n| Science and Innovation measures                         |                                                     |                           |                           |                          |                          |           |                                          |\n| Science and Innovation: Annual pipeline progression     | Science and Innovation: Annual pipeline progression |                           |                           |                          |                          |           |                                          |\n| Pipeline progression events                             | 15%                                                 |                           | 13                        | 25                       | 38                       | 30        | 21%                                      |\n| Regulatory events                                       | 15%                                                 |                           | 25                        | 35                       | 46                       | 46        | 30%                                      |\n| Subtotal - Science and Innovation measures              | 30%                                                 |                           |                           |                          |                          |           | 51%                                      |\n| Financial measures                                      |                                                     |                           |                           |                          |                          |           |                                          |\n| Growth and Therapy Area Leadership                      |                                                     |                           |                           |                          |                          |           |                                          |\n| Total Revenue ($bn)                                     | 30%                                                 |                           | 42.6                      | 43.9                     | 45.2                     | 44.8      | 52%                                      |\n| Achieve Group Financial Targets                         |                                                     |                           |                           |                          |                          |           |                                          |\n| Cash flow ($bn)                                         | 20%                                                 |                           | 7.9                       | 9.3                      | 10.7                     | 9.5       | 23%                                      |\n| Core EPS ($)                                            | 20%                                                 |                           | 6.55                      | 6.89                     | 7. 2 4                   | 7.13      | 34%                                      |\n| Subtotal - Financial measures                           | 70%                                                 |                           |                           |                          |                          |           | 57%                                      |\n| Total                                                   | 100%                                                |                           |                           |                          |                          |           | 159%                                     |\n\nKey:\n\nBar charts are indicative of 2023 performance; scales do not start from zero.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDue to rounding, the total formulaic outcome differs from the arithmetic total of the individual metric outcomes disclosed above.\n\nPipeline progression events include Phase II starts and progressions, and NME and life-cycle management positive Phase III investment decisions.

The Total Revenue and Core EPS measures are both set and evaluated at budget exchange rates at the beginning of the year and evaluated at those rates at the end of the performance period, so that any bene/ficial or adverse movements in currency, which are outside the Company's control, do not impact reward outcomes. The Cash /flow measure is set and evaluated at the actual exchange rate and is evaluated by reference to net cash /flow from operating activities less capital expenditure, adding back proceeds from disposal of intangible assets, to be fully transparent with all elements easily derived from the Group IFRS Cash Flow Statement.\n\n## Overall assessment\n\nDuring 2023, the Executive Directors' individual performance was assessed in the following key areas which align with the Company's objectives.\n\n## Pascal Soriot\n\nMr Soriot has skillfully steered AstraZeneca through another successful year. Commercial execution across all therapy areas and regions was very strong, underpinned by robust manufacturing and supply. Scienti/fic performance in 2023 saw several signi/ficant positive read outs and regulatory approvals, including the launch of three new medicines that will contribute to the delivery of the Company's 2030 Bold Ambition: Airsupra , Truqap and Wainua . Mr Soriot continues to lead the Company to drive Growth Through Innovation in science, with over a third of our pipeline now representing new modalities in 2023, reinforcing the transformative potential of our industry leading pipeline. Mr Soriot also oversaw the identi/fication and signing of a number of impactful business development transactions during the year, including the licensing of a novel GLP-1 asset from Eccogene for obesity, the transaction with CinCor and proposed acquisition of Gracell Biotechnologies, which are expected to further accelerate delivery in cell therapy and oncology.\n\nThroughout 2023, Mr Soriot maintained a strong /financial position for AstraZeneca, delivering yet another year of growth in revenue and pro/fitability. The Committee also considered Mr Soriot's leadership across other dimensions of performance:\n\n| Demonstrating  leadership to support  developments in global  life sciences   | Mr Soriot has continued to drive change through a diverse set of external engagements with world leaders including senior government  of/ficials from the US, Canada, China and Sweden, enhancing strategic partnerships and catalysing innovation, demonstrating his  thought leadership, his ability to drive global change and his in/fluence on key issues. He was the only private sector CEO to deliver a keynote speech at Climate Week in the presence of HM King Charles III and delivered a  key note speech on Public - Private Partnerships for Healthcare Climate Action at COP28 in Dubai. He also attended both the American  Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) and the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) where he had the opportunity to engage  with the scienti/fic community, highlighting pivotal data that strengthens our con/fidence that we will replace conventional chemotherapy  for many patients with advanced lung and breast cancers.   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Leading in                                                                    | Mr Soriot continued to advocate for an uncompromising sustainability agenda at AstraZeneca exemplifying, through his leadership,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n| Environmental, Social &  Governance (ESG)                                     | the essential role of ESG within AstraZeneca's strategy and also the important role global leaders have in the direction of global  decarbonisation, demonstrated by his leadership of the SMI Health Systems; and advancing climate action through his leadership and  involvement in an industry collaboration to increase renewable energy to the industry's supply base.

A description of the Executive Directors' personal achievements is detailed above.\n\nGiven the contributions made by both Mr Soriot and Dr Sarin in 2023 as outlined above, the Committee determined the bonus outturns for both Executive Directors should be 159% of target (or 79.5% of maximum), in line with the formulaic Group scorecard outcome.\n\n## Deferred Bonus Plan (DBP)\n\nHalf of each Executive Director's pre-tax annual bonus is ordinarily deferred under the DBP. In respect of the bonus deferred, the Executive Director is granted a conditional award over shares. No further performance conditions apply to DBP shares. One half of the bonus earned in respect of performance during 2022 was deferred and details of the consequent DBP awards granted in 2023 are shown below. One half of the Executive Directors' bonus earned in respect of performance during 2023 has been deferred and the consequent DBP awards are expected to be granted in March 2024.\n\n## Audited\n\n|                | Ordinary Shares  granted   | Grant date   |   Grant price (pence per share) 1 | 2023 Grant Face value \u00a3'000   | 2024 Grant 2023 Bonus deferred \u00a3'000   |\n|----------------|----------------------------|--------------|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| Pascal Soriot  | 14,448                     | 4 March 2023 |                             10821 | 1,563                         | 1,420                                  |\n| Aradhana Sarin | 7,403                      | 4 March 2023 |                             10821 | 801                           | 728                                    |\n\n- 1 The grant price is the average closing share price over the three dealing days preceding grant.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|                                                     |                   | 2024 Group scorecard performance measures and metrics   | 2024 Group scorecard performance measures and metrics   | 2024 Group scorecard performance measures and metrics   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|\n|                                                     | Measure weighting | Underlying metrics (if applicable)                      | Metric weighting                                        | 2024 target                                             |\n| Science and Innovation: Annual pipeline progression | 30%               | Pipeline progression events                             | 15%                                                     |                                                         |\n|                                                     |                   | Regulatory events                                       | 15%                                                     |                                                         |\n| Growth and Therapy Area Leadership                  | 30%               | Total Revenue                                           | 30%                                                     |                                                         |\n| Achieve Group Financial Targets                     | 40%               | Cash /flow                                              | 20%                                                     |                                                         |\n|                                                     |                   | Core EPS                                                | 20%                                                     |                                                         |\n\n<!-- image -->",

The performance targets are currently considered to be commercially sensitive as prospective disclosure may prejudice the Company's commercial interests.

These shares and dividend equivalents will not be released to the Executive Directors' until the awards vest at the end of the holding period.\n\nThe value of the shares due to vest has been calculated using the average closing share price over the three-month period ended 31 December 2023 (10401 pence). The table below provides a breakdown showing the face value of these shares at the time they were granted, the value that is attributable to share price appreciation since grant, and the value of dividend equivalents accrued on these shares over the relevant performance period. Further information about the individual awards and performance assessments follows the table.\n\n|                |          |                 |                      |                                     |                                         |                                                       | Audited Long-term incentive awards with performance periods ended 31 December 2023   |\n|----------------|----------|-----------------|----------------------|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|                |          | Ordinary Shares |                      | Face value   at time of grant \u00a3'000 | Value due to   share price appreciation | Dividend equivalent  accrued over  performance period | Long-term   incentives total                                                         |\n|                |          | granted         | Performance  outcome |                                     |                                         |                                                       | 1                                                                                    |\n|                |          |                 |                      |                                     | \u00a3'000                                   |                                                       |                                                                                      |\n|                |          |                 |                      |                                     |                                         | \u00a3'000                                                 | \u00a3'000                                                                                |\n| Pascal Soriot  | 2021 PSP | 126,046 2       | 88%                  | 7, 5 91 3                           | 3,946                                   | 751                                                   | 12,288                                                                               |\n| Aradhana Sarin | 2021 PSP | 19,414 4        | 88%                  | 1,402 5                             | 375                                     | 116                                                   | 1,893                                                                                |\n\nThe 2021 PSP awards granted to Mr Soriot on 5 March 2021 and 14 May 2021, to take account of the revised limits for the PSP which were approved by shareholders at the Company's 2021 AGM, are due to vest and be released on 5 March 2026 and 14 May 2026 on completion of a further two-year holding period. The 2021 PSP award was granted to Dr Sarin on 13 August 2021 following her appointment as CFO on 1 August 2021. The award made to Dr Sarin was pro-rated to re/flect that she took up the role part way through 2021. Her award is due to vest on 13 August 2026 on completion of a further two-year holding period. Performance over the period from 1 January 2021 to 31 December 2023 will result in 88% of the awards vesting, based on the following assessment of performance. The 2021 PSP targets were reviewed in light of the enlarged Group following the acquisition of Alexion. The Science and Innovation, Growth and Therapy Area Leadership, Ambition Zero Carbon and Cash /flow targets were all amended in line with the Committee's approach of ensuring performance targets are not materially more or less stretching as a result of the transaction and continue to incentivise strong delivery. No amendments were made to the TSR performance measure.",

The Committee is confident that the increases applied to the targets during that review ensured that they remained ambitious and stretching. The Company does not intend to disclose the original Growth and Therapy Area Leadership target, set prior to the acquisition, as the adjustment to the target relates to a single disease area (Rare Disease), which is therefore commercially sensitive. The other original targets were disclosed in the Company's annual report for the year ended 31 December 2020.\n- 2 The subtotal and total reflect the weightings of the individual metrics.\n- 3 UQ = Upper Quartile.\n\n## PSP awards granted during 2023\n\nDuring 2023, conditional awards of shares were granted to the Executive Directors with face values equivalent to 650% of base pay for Mr Soriot and 450% of base pay for Dr Sarin under the PSP. Face value is calculated using the grant price, being the average closing share price over the three dealing days preceding grant.\n\nPerformance will be assessed over the period from 1 January 2023 to 31 December 2025 against the measures outlined below to determine the proportion of the award that vests.

NME Phase III/registrational volume measures the total NME pipeline volume at the end of the performance period. These two items ensure that management is assessed on both R&D late-stage delivery (approvals) and also future pipeline sustainability (volume).\n\nDisclosing the threshold and maximum hurdles for the Growth and Therapy Area Leadership (Total Revenue) measure could be construed to constitute /financial guidance, which is not the Company's intention. The Total Revenue measure is thus considered to be commercially sensitive and will be disclosed following the end of the performance period.\n\nThe Total Revenue measure is evaluated by reference to budget exchange rates such that bene/ficial or adverse movements in currency, which are outside the Company's control, do not impact reward outcomes. The Cash /flow measure is evaluated using net cumulative cash /flow from operating activities less capital expenditure adding back proceeds from disposal of intangible assets. The companies in the TSR comparator group are shown on page 125.\n\nThe Cash /flow measure is assessed using cumulative net cash /flow from operating activities less capital expenditure adding back proceeds from disposal of intangible assets. Capital expenditure is expected to increase by more than 50% during the performance period, driven by investment in several major manufacturing capabilities such as API, inhaled products, monoclonal antibodies and cell therapy.\n\nOur Ambition Zero Carbon measure is based on our Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions reductions from our 2015 baseline. Further detail on our commitment can be found on page 148.\n\nAs described on page 107, the Committee takes into account a wide range of data to ensure that the stretching nature of PSP hurdles is robustly tested and that /financial targets are aligned with the Company's Mid-Term Plan. The Committee takes consensus and exchange rates into account when determining the appropriate level of stretch.\n\nPSP awards are expected to be granted to the Executive Directors in March 2024. The PSP award to be granted to Dr Sarin will be equivalent to 550% of base pay. The PSP award to be granted to Mr Soriot will be equivalent to 650% of base pay. Subject to the approval of our proposed Directors' Remuneration Policy and amended rules of the PSP at the Company's AGM on 11 April 2024, a further PSP award will be granted to Mr Soriot equivalent to 200% of base pay, bringing Mr Soriot's total PSP award for 2024 in line with the maximum opportunity under the Policy.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information about How our performance measures for 2024 support the delivery of our strategy, and How the Remuneration Committee ensures targets are stretching, see pages 107 and 108.",

Mr Johansson's single total /figure includes of/fice costs (invoiced in Swedish kronor) of \u00a321,955 for the period in 2023 during which he was Chair of the Board and \u00a369,524 for 2022. From 1 May 2023, the Chair of the Board did not receive of/fice costs.\n\n## Non-Executive Directors' fee structure\n\nThe Non-Executive Directors' fees effective from January 2024 are set out in the table below, alongside the fees applicable during 2023. Fees for the Non-Executive Directors (other than the Chair of the Board) are determined by the Chair and the Executive Directors. No Board member participated in any decisions relating to their own fees.\n\nThe fee structure is reviewed, but not necessarily increased every two years. The Non-Executive Directors' fees have not been increased since January 2022. The Chair's fee was separately reviewed in July 2022 and increased with effect from May 2023. It is next due for review in 2024. With effect from January 2024, increases have been made to the basic Board fee for Non-Executive Directors (excluding the Chair), the senior independent Non-Executive Director's fee, the Chairs' fees for Board Committees (excluding the Nomination and Governance Committee in respect of which no additional fees are paid), as well as the fees for membership of the Science Committee and the Sustainability Committee. In the latest review, the overall size and complexity of the AstraZeneca Group was considered, together with the continuing increase in workload, responsibilities, and time commitment for non-executive directors of global, publicly listed companies, in part driven by changes in the corporate governance and regulatory landscape in multiple jurisdictions. The fees for the Chairs of the Science Committee and the Sustainability Committee, as well as membership fees for these Committees, have been increased to re/flect the contribution of these Committees to the sustained future growth of the Company.\n\nThe latest review also considered independently-sourced market data for FTSE 30 and FTSE 10 companies, to ensure that the level of AstraZeneca's fees do not hinder the recruitment of Directors of the right experience and calibre for a Group of our scale in a global market.\n\n| Non-Executive Director fees               | 2023 \u00a3'000   |   2024 \u00a3'000 |\n|-------------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Chair of the Board 1                      | 800 2        |          800 |\n| Basic Non-Executive Director              | 95           |          115 |\n| Senior independent Non-Executive Director | 40           |           48 |\n| Member of the Audit Committee             | 25           |           25 |\n| Chair of the Audit Committee 3            | 45           |           50 |\n| Member of the Remuneration Committee      | 20           |           20 |\n| Chair of the Remuneration Committee 3     | 40           |           45 |\n| Member of the Sustainability Committee    | 15           |           20 |\n| Chair of the Sustainability Committee 3   | 30           |           45 |\n| Member of the Science Committee           | 15           |           20 |\n| Chair of the Science Committee 3          | 30           |           45 |",

The MSR for 2023 are set out below. Shares that count towards the MSR are shares bene/ficially held by the Executive Director and their connected persons and share awards that are not subject to further performance conditions. Share awards included are DBP shares in deferral periods, and PSP and AstraZeneca Investment Plan (AZIP) shares in holding periods, on a net-of-tax basis.\n\nA further post-employment shareholding requirement applies to Executive Directors. For two years following cessation of employment, Executive Directors are required to hold shares to the value of the shareholding requirement that applied at the cessation of their employment; or, in cases where the individual has not had suf/ficient time to build up shares to meet their guideline, the actual level of shareholding at cessation. The post-cessation requirement will be maintained through self-certi/fication, with the Committee keeping this approach under review.\n\n## Position against the 2023 minimum shareholding requirement (MSR) as a percentage of base pay\n\n|                | Bene/ficially owned  shares and shares in  a holding period 1   | Shares in  deferral period 2   | Shares subject   to performance  conditions   | Value of shares   counted towards   MSR as a % of base pay 3   |\n|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Pascal Soriot  | 363,489                                                         | 48,608                         | 308,920                                       | 2,130%                                                         |\n| Aradhana Sarin | 82,514                                                          | 10,652                         | 100,498                                       | 1,018%                                                         |\n\n- 1 Holding period shares included are those which are not subject to continued employment.\n- 2 Shares in deferral periods which are subject to continued employment.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 3 Holding as at 31 December 2023.

Mr Dunoyer stepped down as an Executive Director on 1 August 2021, part way through the 2021 PSP performance period, but remained a member of the SET. Consistent with other participants in the PSP, performance over the period 1 January 2021 to 31 December 2023 will result in 88% of Mr Dunoyer's award granted in 2021 vesting on completion of a further two-year holding period. This represents 8,868 shares vesting when pro-rated to re/flect the performance period during which Mr Dunoyer was an Executive Director (1 January 2021 to 1 August 2021).\n\n## Payments for loss of office\n\nDuring 2023, no payments were made to Directors for loss of of/fice.\n\n## Remuneration in the wider context\n\nIn our Corporate Governance Report on page 81, we explain in detail how the Board has chosen to engage with AstraZeneca's workforce, and how important engagement with our employees is if we are to be a great place to work and continue to deliver outstanding performance. The Directors believe that the Board as a whole should continue to take responsibility for gathering the views of the workforce. Consequently, instead of implementing one of the three methods for workforce engagement prescribed in the 2018 UK Corporate Governance Code, the Board chose to enhance and develop the long-standing channels of engagement which already exist in the organisation to ensure that the Board continues to understand the global workforce's views on a wide variety of topics, including matters relating to remuneration.\n\nThe Committee communicates with, and receives feedback from, employees through a variety of channels, including meetings with high-potential employees and attending site visits, both virtually and in person. This allows the Committee to communicate with employees on remuneration matters where appropriate. Committee members review wide-ranging data on reward across our global workforce, as well as broader information on workforce trends and culture, which is also provided to the full Board. The Committee receives in-depth reports throughout the year on colleague pay, bene/fits, incentives, performance management approach and broader talent policies at AstraZeneca to ensure that the Committee is informed of wider workforce remuneration when making executive pay decisions. Decisions of the Committee affecting employees, such as the annual Group scorecard outcomes, are shared with employees through internal communications as well as through the Directors' Remuneration Report. Additionally, we publish materials on executive remuneration and its implementation for employees on our intranet site. In the event that more signi/ficant changes to workforce remuneration are proposed, active engagement with employee representative groups provides feedback to help the Committee understand the impact upon the broader workforce.\n\nWhen reviewing executive remuneration, the Committee takes into consideration our global workforce, looking to ensure the global total reward offering is competitive, compelling and aligned to our business performance, while supporting a culture where everyone feels valued and included, as outlined in the table on page 122. People and Sustainability is one of our three strategic priorities, and we explain in our Business Review from page 43 the role that reward plays in developing a diverse culture that encourages and rewards innovation, entrepreneurship and high performance. In carrying out its responsibilities and when setting the Policy, the Committee has taken into account the principles of the UK Corporate Governance Code and the factors outlined within Provision 40 as described in the table below.\n\n| Area                                                                                                                                                                                      | Our approach                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Clarity Remuneration arrangements should be transparent and  promote effective engagement with shareholders and  the workforce.                                                           | The Committee believes the remuneration structures under both the current and proposed Directors'  Remuneration Policy, and those for the wider workforce as set out below, are clearly understood.

This group represents approximately 12% of our total employee population. The Regulations provide /flexibility to adopt one of three methods of calculation; we continue to use Option A which is a calculation based on all UK employees on a full-time equivalent basis as we consider this to be the most appropriate method of comparison and in line with the calculation of CEO's realised pay (shown on page 109 for 2023). The ratios are based on total pay, which includes base pay, bene/fits, bonus and Long-term incentive (LTI) awards with all elements adjusted on a full-time equivalent basis if required. Our calculations are in line with the single /figure methodology for UK employees where possible, with quartile data determined as at 31 December 2023. Calculations for UK employees are based on actual base pay and bene/fits data for the year, with estimates only used for annual bonus outcomes and LTI dividend equivalents. These estimates are based on the 2023 bonus budget and projected payouts, and anticipated dividends on LTI awards, respectively. No elements of pay have been excluded from the calculation, which has been determined following the approach of previous years.\n\n|   Pay data 1  (\u00a3'000) | Base pay   | Total pay   |   Base pay |   25th percentile Total pay |   Base pay |   50th percentile Total pay |   Base pay |   75th percentile Total pay |\n|-----------------------|------------|-------------|------------|-----------------------------|------------|-----------------------------|------------|-----------------------------|\n|                  2023 | 1,429      | 16,853      |         46 |                          62 |         65 |                          92 |         88 |                         139 |\n|                  2022 | 1,367      | 15,323      |         48 |                          67 |         67 |                          96 |         88 |                         143 |\n|                  2021 | 1,327      | 13,858      |         43 |                          58 |         61 |                          86 |         86 |                         130 |\n|                  2020 | 1,289      | 15,447      |         41 |                          54 |         60 |                          78 |         82 |                         119 |\n|                  2019 | 1,289      | 14,330      |         38 |                          51 |         53 |                          75 |         71 |                         117 |\n|                  2018 | 1,251      | 11,356      |         36 |                          49 |         50 |                          71 |         70 |                         110 |\n\nThe pay ratios at each quartile were higher in 2023 when compared to last year, due to a combination of signi/ficant share price appreciation over the performance period of the CEO's 2021 Performance Share Plan award (representing 23% of the overall single /figure), which was granted at a higher face value than the 2020 award (650% of base pay versus 550%), and a lower overall bonus pool for employees in 2023 based on Scorecard performance impacting total pay.\n\nGiven the Committee's focus on ensuring CEO pay is performance-driven (and as demonstrated again this year), the majority of the single /figure is comprised of variable pay and therefore may vary signi/ficantly year-on-year due to annual bonus and PSP outcomes, as well as share price movements. The Committee therefore also considers the CEO pay ratio without the LTI impact. When excluding LTI, the pay ratio of the CEO compared to the median UK employee is 52:1 - in line with the trend across prior years.\n\n|                                     | 2018   | 2019   | 2020   | 2021   | 2022   | 2023   |\n|-------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| 50th percentile ratio excluding LTI | 51:1   | 51:1   | 53:1   | 57:1   | 51:1   | 52:1   |\n\nThe Committee remains mindful of the debate on executive pay and seeks to ensure that when determining the remuneration of the CEO it /finds the right balance when rewarding performance in a highly competitive global executive talent market. It believes the median ratio is consistent with the pay and progression policies for UK employees, which ensures our total reward offering is competitive and compelling, and aligned to individual and business performance as set out on page 121.\n\n## Relative importance of spend on pay\n\nThe table below shows the remuneration paid to all employees in the Group, including the Executive Directors, and expenditure on shareholder distributions through dividends.

Ms Rahman joined the Committee on 1 May 2023. Leif Johansson was also a member of the Committee until he retired from the Board on 27 April 2023. The Deputy Company Secretary acts as secretary to the Committee. The Committee met six times in 2023 and members' attendance records are set out on page 77. During the year, the Committee was materially assisted, except in relation to their own remuneration, by the CEO; the CFO; the SVP, Finance, Group Controller & Head of Global Finance Services; the SVP, Group Planning & Finance Business Partnering; the SVP, Global Portfolio/Project Management and Strategic Planning; the VP, Global SHE & Operations Sustainability; the Chief Human Resources Of/ficer, Chief Compliance Of/ficer and General Counsel; the SVP, Reward, Inclusion and Talent Acquisition; the Senior Director Executive Reward; the Company Secretary; the Deputy Company Secretary; and the Non-Executive Directors forming the Science and Sustainability Committees. The Committee's independent adviser attended all Committee meetings.\n\n## Independent adviser to the Committee\n\nThe Committee reappointed Willis Towers Watson (WTW) as its independent adviser. WTW were /first appointed in September 2018, following a tender process undertaken in 2018. The tender process involved submission of written proposals, followed by shortlisted candidates being interviewed by both Committee members and members of the Company's management. WTW's service to the Committee during 2023 was provided on a time spent basis at a cost to the Company of \u00a3252,322, excluding VAT. During 2023, WTW also provided pensions advice and administration, and advice and support to management including market data to assist in the annual employee pay review and global pay survey data. WTW have no other connection with the Company or individual Directors. The Committee reviewed the potential for con/flicts of interest related to WTW and judged that there were no con/flicts. WTW is a member of the Remuneration Consultants Group, which is responsible for the stewardship and development of the voluntary code of conduct in relation to executive remuneration consulting in the UK. The principles on which the code is based are transparency, integrity, objectivity, competence, due care and con/fidentiality. WTW adheres to the code.",

As a condition of annual bonus and Performance Share Plan awards, the Committee seeks active acceptance of the malus and clawback terms applicable each year before any payment or grant is made to an individual. Additionally, the Committee's practice is to fully document and evidence any application of malus or clawback to show that it has not acted arbitrarily, capriciously or irrationally in making any determination. This allows the Committee to:\n\n- > Reduce the amount of bonus or PSP payable, or clawback some or all of any award in the circumstances and periods as set out within our Global Standard on Malus and Clawback.\n- > Cancel bonus eligibility.\n- > Prevent vesting of the PSP and/or DBP awards by holding the shares in AstraZeneca's LTI nominee platform to prevent transactions.\n\n## Shareholder voting at the AGM\n\nAt the Company's AGM on 27 April 2023, shareholders voted in favour of a resolution to approve the Annual Statement of the Chair of the Remuneration Committee and the Annual Report on Remuneration for the year ended 31 December 2022.

        "page_content": "## Remuneration Policy\n\n## continued\n\n## Remuneration Policy\n\nThis section sets out the Policy proposed for approval by shareholders at the Company's AGM on 11 April 2024. Subject to shareholder approval, the Policy is intended to remain in effect for three years from the 2024 AGM. The previous page summarises how the new Policy differs from the Policy which was approved by shareholders at the 2021 AGM.\n\n## Setting the Policy\n\nThe Remuneration Committee (the Committee) is responsible for setting overall remuneration policy and makes decisions about speci/fic remuneration arrangements in the broader context of employee remuneration throughout the Group. The Committee reviews remuneration data for the wider workforce at several points during the year, including ratios of average employee pay to senior executive pay; bonus and base pay data; as well as gender and geographical data in relation to base pay and variable compensation. This includes a workforce remuneration review to understand the ways in which reward is differentiated by contribution across the population.\n\nRemuneration for all roles within the organisation is benchmarked against that for comparable roles in similar organisations and in the employee's local market. Executive Directors' remuneration is benchmarked against global and European pharmaceutical peer groups. In reviewing the base pay of Executive Directors, the Committee considers the overall level of any base pay increases being awarded to employees in the Executive Director's local market in the relevant year. In setting, reviewing and implementing the Policy, the Committee seeks independent advice and ensures that no Director makes decisions relating to their own remuneration. The Committee connects with the Audit Committee to ensure that the Group's remuneration policies and practices achieve the right balance between appropriate incentives to reward good performance, management of risk, and the pursuit of the Company's strategic objectives.\n\nThe Board as a whole takes responsibility for gathering the views of AstraZeneca's workforce, and does so through multiple channels of engagement. While the Committee does not consult employees speci/fically when setting the Policy, the Company engages with employees, either on a Group-wide basis or in the context of smaller focus groups, to solicit feedback generally on a wide range of matters, including pay. Details of our approach to executive remuneration and its implementation are available to employees on our intranet site, Nucleus. Many employees are also shareholders in the Company and therefore have the opportunity to vote on the Policy at the 2024 AGM.\n\nIn all aspects of its work, the Committee considers both the external environment in which the Company operates and the guidance issued by organisations representing institutional shareholders. It consults the Company's major investors on general and speci/fic remuneration matters and provides opportunities for representatives of those investors to meet the Chair of the Committee and other Committee and Board members. It is the Company's policy to seek input from major shareholders on an ad hoc basis when signi/ficant changes to remuneration arrangements are proposed. A thorough consultation process was undertaken as this Policy was developed, with investors' feedback on the Committee's proposals in/fluencing the /final Policy. The Company's shareholders are encouraged to attend the AGM and any views expressed will be considered by Committee members.\n\n## Legacy arrangements\n\nThe Committee may approve remuneration payments and payments for loss of of/fice on terms that differ to the terms in the Policy where the terms of the payment were agreed before the Policy came into effect or were agreed at a time when the relevant individual was not a Director of the Company (provided that, in the opinion of the Committee, the agreement was not entered into in consideration for the individual becoming a Director of the Company). This includes the exercise of any discretion available to the Committee in connection with such payments. For these purposes, payments include the Committee satisfying awards of variable remuneration, including share awards, in line with the terms agreed at the time the award was granted.\n\n## Minor amendments\n\nThe Committee may make minor amendments to the arrangements for Directors described in the Policy without shareholder approval for regulatory, exchange control, tax or administrative purposes or to take account of a change in legislation.",

On an annual basis, the base pay for individual roles are reviewed in the context of the external market. AstraZeneca participates in annual global compensation surveys, which provide benchmarking data for all roles within the organisation, ensuring a robust base pay review process for all roles. The Company seeks to provide an appropriate range of competitive bene/fits, including healthcare and pension, to all employees (including Executive Directors) in the context of their local market.\n\nEmployees globally may be eligible for LTI awards in the form of the PSP and/or restricted stock units depending on their level and market. The occupants of senior roles in the Company are currently eligible for PSP awards - these are the leaders who have the ability to directly in/fluence the execution of the Company's strategic goals.

to attract and retain the best candidate available, within the limits of our approved Policy. The Committee will offer a remuneration package that it considers appropriate in the particular circumstances of the recruitment, giving due regard to the interests of the Company's shareholders and taking into account factors such as typical market practice, existing arrangements for the other Executive Directors, internal relativities and market positioning.\n\nThe pharmaceutical industry is global, and future Executive Directors might be recruited from organisations with pay structures and practices that differ from AstraZeneca's usual Policy. The Committee believes that it is in the interests of shareholders for it to retain an element of /flexibility in its approach to recruitment to enable it to attract the best candidates; however, this /flexibility is limited.\n\nThe Committee may /find it necessary to compensate a new recruit for forfeiture of entitlements as a consequence of the recruit leaving their previous employment to join AstraZeneca. There is no limit to the value of such compensation arrangements, however the Committee will rigorously consider the appropriate value so as not to pay more than the compensation being forfeited. The Committee will seek to offer a package weighted towards equity in the Company, and will usually seek to use the PSP as the primary vehicle for buy-out awards where possible; however, the precise nature of the compensation arrangement will depend on the type of entitlement being forfeited. The arrangement might therefore comprise a combination of cash, share awards granted under the PSP (subject to the Policy maximum), and other restricted shares. The Committee may introduce a one-off arrangement as permitted under Listing Rule 9.4.2 in order to deliver a restricted share award. Malus and clawback provisions would normally apply to buy-out awards, for the same reasons as detailed under the DBP and PSP.\n\nRestricted share awards will only be granted as part of the recruitment arrangements to compensate for loss of remuneration opportunities suffered on leaving previous employment.\n\nThe Committee considers whether the lost incentives were subject to performance targets and their probability of vesting. The normal approach is to seek broadly to mirror the timing of vesting and application of performance targets of the compensation being forfeited. For example, a buy-out award may be granted without performance conditions where the foregone compensation was not subject to performance testing, however the Committee may apply appropriate performance measures if it considers it appropriate.\n\nThe Committee may allow a restricted share award to vest in tranches at different dates. If no performance targets are attached to a compensatory award, it will vest in full if the individual remains in employment on the vesting date. On vesting, additional shares (or cash) equivalent in value to the dividends that would have been paid during the vesting period will be awarded to the Director. These additional shares (or cash) may be calculated on a cumulative dividend reinvestment basis or otherwise.",

The Committee has discretion to award payments in certain circumstances, as set out on the following page, depending on the nature of the termination and the Executive Director's performance. The LTI plans are governed by plan rules, which de/fine how individual awards under those plans should be treated upon termination of employment and corporate activity, including sale of a business outside the Group. The treatment of awards in these circumstances will be determined according to the rules and subject to Committee discretion. Aside from the reasons relating to corporate activity, generally, awards under LTI plans will be allowed to vest for those Executive Directors who leave the Company in circumstances such as ill health, injury, disability, redundancy or retirement, or any other reason the Committee considers appropriate, or where employment terminates by reason of the Executive Director's death (see the table on page 136 for further information). Awards that are allowed to vest will typically be pro-rated for time, subject to the Committee's discretion. In addition to any payment in lieu of notice, the individual components of remuneration and other payments which may be payable on loss of of/fice are set out on the following pages, subject to the terms of any applicable bonus rules or share plan rules. No awards will vest where an individual has been dismissed for cause.",

        "page_content": "## Preparation of the Financial Statements and Directors' Responsibilities\n\nThe Directors are responsible for preparing this Annual Report and Form 20-F Information and the Group and Parent Company Financial Statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations.\n\nCompany law requires the Directors to prepare Financial Statements for each financial year. Under that law the Directors have prepared the Group Financial Statements in accordance with UK-adopted international accounting standards and with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 as applicable to companies reporting under those standards and Parent Company Financial Statements in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards, comprising FRS 101 'Reduced Disclosure Framework', and applicable law). In preparing the Group Financial Statements, the Directors have also elected to comply with IFRS Accounting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and International Accounting Standards as adopted by the European Union.\n\nUnder company law, the Directors must not approve the Financial Statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and Parent Company and of their profit or loss for that period. In preparing each of the Group and Parent Company Financial Statements, the Directors are required to:\n\n- > select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently\n- > make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent\n- > for the Group Financial Statements, state whether they have been prepared in accordance with UK-adopted International Accounting Standards\n- > for the Parent Company Financial Statements, state whether FRS 101 has been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the Parent Company Financial Statements\n- > prepare the Financial Statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and the Parent Company will continue in business.\n\nThe Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Parent Company's transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Parent Company and enable them to ensure that its Financial Statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They have general responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the Group and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.\n\n## Directors' Annual Report on Internal Controls over Financial Reporting\n\nThe Directors are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. AstraZeneca's internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance over the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.\n\nDue to its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risks that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\nThe Directors assessed the effectiveness of AstraZeneca's internal control over financial reporting as at 31 December 2023 based on the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013). Based on this assessment, internal control over financial reporting is effective.\n\nPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has audited the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as at 31 December 2023 and has issued an unqualified report thereon.\n\nUnder applicable law and regulations, the Directors are also responsible for preparing a Directors' Report, Strategic Report, Directors' Remuneration Report, Corporate Governance Report and Audit Committee Report that comply with that law and those regulations.\n\nThe Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on our website. Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and dissemination of Financial Statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.\n\n## Directors' responsibility statement pursuant to DTR 4\n\nThe Directors confirm that to the best of our knowledge:\n\n- > the Financial Statements, prepared in accordance with the applicable set of accounting standards, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole\n- > the Directors' Report includes a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the position of the issuer and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole, together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that they face.\n\nOn behalf of the Board of Directors on 8 February 2024\n\n## Pascal Soriot\n\nDirector",

Our responsibilities under ISAs (UK) are further described in the Auditors' responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\n## Independence\n\nWe remained independent of the Group in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the UK, which includes the FRC's Ethical Standard, as applicable to listed public interest entities, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.\n\nTo the best of our knowledge and belief, we declare that non-audit services prohibited by the FRC's Ethical Standard were not provided.\n\nOther than those disclosed in Note 31, we have provided no non-audit services to the Company or its controlled undertakings in the period under audit.\n\n## Our audit approach Overview\n\n## Audit scope\n\n- > We identified eight reporting components which required a full scope audit of their complete financial information, either due to their size or risk characteristics. These components are the principal operating units in the US (two components), the UK, Sweden, China (two components) and Ireland, as well as the Company. One or more individual balances for certain of these reporting components were audited by our team based in Poland (for research and development and inventory) and our team in Malaysia (property, plant and equipment), as these are the locations where the accounting records reside.\n- > We also included Japan and Germany as two additional reporting components which had one or more individual balances that were considered significant to the Group's financial statements. For these components our work was solely focussed on revenue, accounts receivable and journals testing.\n- > We also identified five shared service centres where audit procedures were performed over certain shared service functions for IT general controls and transaction processing. Audit procedures were performed centrally in relation to various balances and activities accounted for and managed centrally including: goodwill, intangible assets (excluding software), pension obligations, centralised cash, borrowings and financial instruments, taxation, other investments and litigation matters, as well as the consolidation.\n- > The above procedures accounted for 72% of the Group's revenue and 72% of the Group's absolute profit before tax.\n\nIn our opinion, the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRS Accounting Standards as issued by the IASB.\n\n## Key audit matters\n\n- > Recognition and measurement of accruals for Managed Care, Medicaid and Medicare Part D rebates on US Product Sales (excluding Rare Diseases) (Group)\n- > Impairment assessment of the product, marketing and distribution rights and other intangibles (Group)\n- > Recognition and measurement of legal provisions and disclosure of contingent liabilities (Group)\n- > Recognition, measurement and disclosure of tax liabilities for uncertain tax treatments (Group)\n- > Valuation of defined benefit obligations in the UK and Sweden (Group)\n- > Distributable reserves in the Company (Parent)\n\n## Materiality\n\n- > Overall Group materiality: $440m (2022: $400m) based on approximately 5% of profit before tax after adding back intangible asset impairment charges (Note 10), fair value movements and discount unwind on contingent consideration and other payables assumed from the Alexion acquisition (Note 20), the discount unwind on the Acerta Pharma share purchase liability (Note 3), the discount unwind on certain other payables arising from intangible asset acquisitions (Note 3), material legal net settlements (Note 21), the unwind of the fair value adjustment to Alexion inventories (Note 2) and restructuring charges relating to the Post Alexion Acquisition Group Review (Note 2).\n- > Overall Company materiality: $110m (2022: $100m) based on 0.2% of net assets as constrained by the allocation of overall Group materiality.\n- > Performance materiality: $330m (2022: $300m) (Group) and $82.5m (2022: $75m) (Company).\n\n## The scope of our audit\n\nAs part of designing our audit, we determined materiality and assessed the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements.\n\n## Key audit matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in the auditors' professional judgement, were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) identified by the auditors, including those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy; the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team. These matters, and any comments we make on the results of our procedures thereon, were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\nThis is not a complete list of all risks identified by our audit.\n\nThe key audit matters below are consistent with last year.",

        "page_content": "## Independent auditors' report to the members of AstraZeneca PLC continued\n\n## Key audit matter\n\n## How our audit addressed the key audit matter\n\n## Recognition and measurement of accruals for Managed Care, Medicaid and Medicare Part D rebates on US Product Sales (excluding Rare Diseases) (Group)\n\nRefer to the Audit Committee Report, Group Accounting Policies and Notes 1 and 20 in the Group financial statements.\n\nIn the US the Group recognises revenue on Product Sales under various commercial and government mandated contracts and reimbursement arrangements that include rebates, of which the most significant are Managed Care, Medicaid and Medicare Part D relating to US Product Sales.\n\nRebates provided to customers under these arrangements are accounted for as variable consideration, and recognised as a reduction to revenue, for which unsettled amounts are accrued. At the time Product Sales are invoiced, rebates and deductions that the Group expects to pay, are estimated. There is significant management estimation in determining the accruals in the US. Assumptions used to estimate the rebates are monitored and adjusted regularly in light of contractual and legal obligations, historical trends, past experience and projected market conditions.\n\nThe US Rebates, chargebacks, returns and other revenue accruals liability (excluding Rare Diseases) at 31 December 2023 amounted to $4,926m (2022: $3,822m), principally consisting of rebates related to Managed Care, Medicaid and Medicare Part D.\n\n## Impairment assessment of the product, marketing and distribution rights and other intangibles (Group)\n\nRefer to the Audit Committee Report, Group Accounting Policies and Note 10 in the Group financial statements.\n\nThe Group has product, marketing and distribution rights and other intangible assets (hereafter referred to as the intangible assets) totalling $37,587m at 31 December 2023 (2022: $38,890m). Those intangible assets under development and not available for use are tested annually for impairment and other intangible assets are tested when there is an indication of impairment loss or reversal.\n\nThe recoverability of the carrying value of cash generating units (to which the intangible assets belong) depends on future cash flows and/or the outcome of research and development ('R&D') activities including decisions by the Group to terminate development. The determination of the recoverable amounts include significant estimates, which are highly sensitive and depend upon key assumptions including the outcome of R&D activities, probability of technical and regulatory success, market volume, share and pricing (to derive peak year sales), the amount and timing of projected future cash flows and sales erosion curves following patent expiry. Changes in these assumptions could have an impact on the recoverable amount of the Group's intangible assets.\n\nDuring 2023, $434m (2022: $241m) of net impairment charges were recorded (of which $417m (2022: $95m) was recorded in Research and development expenses and $17m (2022: $146m) within Selling, general and administrative costs).\n\n## Recognition and measurement of legal provisions and disclosure of contingent liabilities (Group)\n\nRefer to the Audit Committee Report, Group Accounting Policies, Notes 21 and 30 in the Group financial statements.\n\nThe Group is involved in various legal proceedings, including actual or threatened litigation and actual or potential government investigations relating to employment matters, product liability, commercial disputes, pricing, sales and marketing practices, infringement of IP rights and the validity of certain patents and competition laws. As at 31 December 2023 the Group held provisions of $1,016m (2022: $161m) in respect of legal claims and settlements (together, legal provisions) and disclosed the more significant legal proceedings as contingent liabilities in Note 30.\n\nThere is significant judgement by management when assessing the timing and likelihood of loss being incurred and whether a legal provision can be reasonably estimated and recorded or if a contingent liability needs to be disclosed. Management's assessment of the amounts concerned relies heavily on estimates and assumptions.\n\nWe evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls relating to the recognition and measurement of the accruals for the Managed Care, Medicaid and Medicare Part D. We determined that we could rely on these controls for the purposes of our audit.\n\n## We:\n\n- > developed an independent estimate of the Managed Care, Medicaid and Medicare Part D accruals using the terms of the specific rebate programmes and/or contracts with customers, historical revenue data; market demand and market conditions in the US; third party information on inventory held by direct and indirect customers; and the historical trend of actual rebate claims paid;\n- > compared our independent estimates to the accruals recorded by management;\n- > assessed the effect of any adjustments to prior years' accruals in the current year's results; and\n- > tested actual payments made and rebate claims processed by the Group, and evaluated those claims for consistency with the contractual and mandated terms of the Group's arrangements.\n\nWe utilised our in-house experts with specialised skills and knowledge to assist in assessing the compliance of the Group's Medicaid rebate policies against the regulatory policies, and subsequently evaluating the Group's calculation of the Medicaid drug rebate.\n\nBased on the procedures performed, we considered the accruals to be reasonable. We evaluated the disclosures in Notes 1 and 20 of the Group financial statements, and considered them to be appropriate.\n\nWe evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over management's assessment of the impairment of intangible assets. We determined that we could rely on these controls for the purposes of our audit.\n\nFor those assets or cash generating units in the scope of our audit we:\n\n- > tested management's process for assessing whether there is an indication of impairment and the process for determining the recoverable amount;\n- > tested the completeness and accuracy of the models as well as the underlying data used in the models, which included reconciling the cash flows to the Board approved Group level budgets and forecasts; and\n- > evaluated the significant assumptions used by management in determining future cash flows, including the probability of technical and regulatory success, peak year sales and sales erosion curves.\n\nIn evaluating the reasonableness of management's assumptions we:\n\n- > compared significant assumptions to external data and benchmarks; and\n- > performed a retrospective comparison of forecasted revenues and costs to actual performance.\n\nWe utilised our in-house valuation experts to assist with the evaluation of the probability of technical and regulatory success.\n\nBased on the procedures performed, we determined that the net impairment charge recorded for intangible assets was reasonable. We evaluated the disclosures in Note 10 of the Group financial statements, and considered them to be appropriate.\n\nWe evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls in respect of the recognition and measurement of legal proceedings and related disclosures. We determined that we could rely on these controls for the purposes of our audit.\n\nWe enquired of internal legal counsel and where appropriate external legal counsel. We obtained and evaluated letters of audit enquiry with the Group's internal and external legal counsel for significant litigation. We have inspected certain external legal documents. We tested the completeness of management's assessment of both the identification of legal proceedings and possible outcomes of each significant legal claim. We evaluated the reasonableness of management's assessment regarding whether an adverse outcome is probable and estimated reliably. We evaluated management's judgement regarding the proceedings set out as contingent liabilities within Note 30.\n\nBased on the procedures performed, for the provisions recorded and contingent liabilities disclosed, we considered them to be reasonable. We evaluated the disclosures in Notes 21 and 30 of the Group financial statements, and considered them to be appropriate.",

In establishing the overall approach to the Group audit, we determined the type of work that needed to be performed by us, as the Group engagement team, or component auditors within PwC UK and other PwC network firms operating under our instruction. Where the work was performed by component auditors, we determined the level of involvement we needed to have in the audit work in these territories to be able to conclude whether sufficient appropriate audit evidence had been obtained as a basis for our opinion on the Group financial statements as a whole.\n\nWe identified eight reporting components which required a full scope audit of their complete financial information, either due to their financial significance to the Group or specific risk characteristics. These components are the principal operating units in the US (two components), China (two components), the UK, Sweden, and Ireland, as well as the Company.\n\nWe also identified a further two reporting components which both had individual financial statement line item balances that were considered significant to the Group's financial statements. For these components our work was solely focussed on the audit of revenue and accounts receivable. The two components also performed journal testing in support of an overall Group significant risk.\n\nWithin our overall Group scope we performed procedures at five of AstraZeneca's Shared Service Centres (SSCs); Warsaw, Kuala Lumpur, Delhi, Cluj and San Jose. The testing procedures performed at the SSCs included controls testing and IT general controls testing. In addition to the work performed by the SSCs a number of centralised audit procedures were\n\nperformed by the Group audit team. These procedures primarily related to the audit of goodwill, intangible assets (excluding software), pension obligations, centralised cash, borrowings and financial instruments, taxation, other investments, litigation matters, and the Group consolidation.\n\nOur Group engagement team's involvement in the oversight of the reporting components and SSCs was continuous throughout the audit process. As part of our cycle of in person oversight we visited; China and the US (covering both components in each country), Sweden and Ireland and were in regular contact with our UK component team in Cambridge. We also visited the SSCs in Poland and India.\n\nIn addition to these on site visits, regular virtual meetings with the component auditors were held, whereby we performed reviews of the component auditors' planned response to significant risks, and reviewed the component auditors working papers. The work that is performed at the SSCs is overseen by the Group engagement team, and follows the same review and oversight process as the components. Alongside our team oversight we attended meetings with local management.\n\n## The impact of climate risk on our audit\n\nIn planning and executing our audit, we considered the potential impact of climate change on the Group's business and the financial statements. The Group has set out its intention - as part of the Ambition Zero Carbon programme - to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions by maximising energy efficiency, shifting to renewable energy sources and investing in nature-based removals to compensate for any residual GHG footprint.\n\nAs a part of our audit we made enquiries of management to understand the extent of the potential impact of the physical and transitional climate change risk on the Group financial statements. We also discussed the climate change initiatives and commitments from Ambition Zero Carbon and other initiatives to reduce CO2 emissions, and the impact these have on the Group including on future cash flow\n\nforecasts. This includes the committed investment to the 'AZ Forest' through 2030 and the continued commitment to develop next-generation respiratory inhalers with near-zero global warming potential propellants for the pMDI inhaled medicines portfolio.\n\nManagement considers that the impact of climate change does not give rise to a material financial statement impact. With the assistance of our climate change experts we evaluated management's risk assessment and understood the Group's governance processes including the Sustainability Committee. We performed an audit risk assessment of how the impact of the Group's commitments in respect of climate change including Ambition Zero Carbon may affect the financial statements and our audit.\n\nWe challenged the extent to which climate change considerations including the expected cash flows from the initiatives and commitments had been reflected, where appropriate, in management's impairment assessment process, going concern assessment and viability assessment. We found that climate change impacts are included within management's forecasts although the initiatives and commitments did not have a material impact including on our key audit matters. We assessed the consistency of other information disclosed in the Annual Report with the Group financial statements, and with our knowledge obtained from the audit.\n\n## Materiality\n\nThe scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. We set certain quantitative thresholds for materiality. These, together with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures on the individual financial statement line items and disclosures and in evaluating the effect of misstatements, both individually and in aggregate on the financial statements as a whole.\n\nBased on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows:\n\n|                                  | Financial statements - Group                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Financial statements - Company                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Overall materiality              | $440m (2022: $400m).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | $110m (2022: $100m).                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n| How we determined it             | Approximately 5% of profit before tax after adding back intangible asset  impairment charges (Note 10), fair value movements and discount unwind on  contingent consideration and other payables assumed from the Alexion  acquisition (Note 20), the discount unwind on the Acerta Pharma share purchase  liability (Note 3), the discount unwind on certain other payables arising from  intangible asset acquisitions (Note 3), material legal net settlements (Note 21),  the unwind of the fair value adjustment to Alexion inventories (Note 2) and  restructuring charges relating to the Post Alexion Acquisition Group Review  (Note 2) | 0.2% of net assets as constrained by the allocation  of overall Group materiality                                                                                                                                                           |\n| Rationale for  benchmark applied | The reported profit of the Group can fluctuate due to intangible asset impairment  charges, fair value and discount unwind movements on contingent consideration,  the discount unwind on the Acerta Pharma share purchase liability, the discount  unwind on certain other payables arising from intangible asset acquisitions,  material legal net settlements, the unwind of the fair value adjustment to Alexion  inventories and the restructuring costs resulting from the Post Alexion Acquisition                                                                                                                                        | We have considered the nature of the business of  AstraZeneca PLC (being a holding Company for  investment activities) and have determined that net  assets are an appropriate basis for the calculation of  the overall materiality level. |",

        "page_content": "## Independent auditors' report to the members of AstraZeneca PLC continued\n\nFor each component in the scope of our Group audit, we allocated a materiality that is less than our overall Group materiality. The range of materiality allocated across components was between $45m and $250m.\n\nWe use performance materiality to reduce to an appropriately low level the probability that the aggregate of uncorrected and undetected misstatements exceeds overall materiality. Specifically, we use performance materiality in determining the scope of our audit and the nature and extent of our testing of account balances, classes of transactions and disclosures, for example in determining sample sizes. Our performance materiality was 75% (2022: 75%%) of overall materiality, amounting to $330m (2022: $300m) for the Group financial statements and $82.5m (2022: $75m) for the Company financial statements.\n\nIn determining the performance materiality, we considered a number of factors - the history of misstatements, risk assessment and aggregation risk and the effectiveness of controls - and concluded that an amount at the upper end of our normal range was appropriate.\n\nWe agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them misstatements identified during our audit above $22m (Group audit) (2022: $20m) and $22m (Company audit) (2022: $20m) as well as misstatements below those amounts that, in our view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons.\n\n## Conclusions relating to going concern\n\nOur evaluation of the directors' assessment of the Group's and the Company's ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting included:\n\n- > agreeing the underlying cash flow projections to Board approved Group level budgets and forecasts, assessing how these forecasts are compiled, and assessing the accuracy of management's forecasts;\n- > evaluating the key assumptions within management's forecasts and ensuring that such assumptions are consistent with those modelled in relation to impairments;\n- > considering liquidity and available financial resources;\n- > assessing whether the stress testing performed by management appropriately considered the principal risks facing the business; and\n- > evaluating the feasibility of management's mitigating actions in the stress testing scenarios and performing our own sensitivities.\n\nBased on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating to events or conditions that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the Group's and the Company's ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least twelve months from when the financial statements are authorised for issue.\n\nIn auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate.\n\nHowever, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, this conclusion is not a guarantee as to the Group's and the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.\n\nIn relation to the directors' reporting on how they have applied the UK Corporate Governance Code, we have nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to the directors' statement in the financial statements\n\nabout whether the directors considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting.\n\nOur responsibilities and the responsibilities of the directors with respect to going concern are described in the relevant sections of this report.\n\n## Reporting on other information\n\nThe other information comprises all of the information in the Annual Report other than the financial statements and our auditors' report thereon. The directors are responsible for the other information. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion or, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in this report, any form of assurance thereon.\n\nIn connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify an apparent material inconsistency or material misstatement, we are required to perform procedures to conclude whether there is a material misstatement of the financial statements or a material misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report based on these responsibilities.\n\nWith respect to the Strategic Report and Directors' Report, we also considered whether the disclosures required by the UK Companies Act 2006 have been included.\n\nBased on our work undertaken in the course of the audit, the Companies Act 2006 requires us also to report certain opinions and matters as described below.\n\n## Strategic Report and Directors' Report\n\nIn our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit, the information given in the Strategic Report and Directors' Report for the year ended 31 December 2023 is consistent with the financial statements and has been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.\n\nIn light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group and Company and their environment obtained in the course of the audit, we did not identify any material misstatements in the Strategic Report and Directors' Report.\n\n## Directors' Remuneration\n\nIn our opinion, the part of the Directors' Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.\n\n## Corporate governance statement\n\nThe Listing Rules require us to review the directors' statements in relation to going concern, longer-term viability and that part of the corporate governance statement relating to the Company's compliance with the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code specified for our review. Our additional responsibilities with respect to the corporate governance statement as other information are described in the Reporting on other information section of this report.\n\nBased on the work undertaken as part of our audit, we have concluded that each of the following elements of the corporate governance statement, included within\n\nthe Corporate Governance Overview, Corporate Governance Report, Nomination and Governance Committee Report, Science Committee Report, Sustainability Committee Report and Audit Committee Report is materially consistent with the financial statements and our knowledge obtained during the audit, and we have nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to:\n\n- > The directors' confirmation that they have carried out a robust assessment of the emerging and principal risks;\n- > The disclosures in the Annual Report that describe those principal risks, what procedures are in place to identify emerging risks and an explanation of how these are being managed or mitigated;\n- > The directors' statement in the financial statements about whether they considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing them, and their identification of any material uncertainties to the Group's and Company's ability to continue to do so over a period of at least twelve months from the date of approval of the financial statements;\n- > The directors' explanation as to their assessment of the Group's and Company's prospects, the period this assessment covers and why the period is appropriate; and\n- > The directors' statement as to whether they have a reasonable expectation that the Company will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period of its assessment, including any related disclosures drawing attention to any necessary qualifications or assumptions.\n\nOur review of the directors' statement regarding the longer-term viability of the Group and Company was substantially less in scope than an audit and only consisted of making inquiries and considering the directors' process supporting their statement; checking that the statement is in alignment with the relevant provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code; and considering whether the statement is consistent with the financial statements and our knowledge and understanding of the Group and Company and their environment obtained in the course of the audit.\n\nIn addition, based on the work undertaken as part of our audit, we have concluded that each of the following elements of the corporate governance statement is materially consistent with the financial statements and our knowledge obtained during the audit:\n\n- > The directors' statement that they consider the Annual Report, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable, and provides the information necessary for the members to assess the Group's and Company's position, performance, business model and strategy;\n- > The section of the Annual Report that describes the review of effectiveness of risk management and internal control systems; and\n- > The section of the Annual Report describing the work of the Audit Committee.\n\nWe have nothing to report in respect of our responsibility to report when the directors' statement relating to the Company's compliance with the Code does not properly disclose a departure from a relevant provision of the Code specified under the Listing Rules for review by the auditors.",

        "page_content": "## Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit\n\n## Responsibilities of the directors for the financial statements\n\nAs explained more fully in the Preparation of the Financial Statements and Directors' Responsibilities section, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements in accordance with the applicable framework and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. The directors are also responsible for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the Group's and the Company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the Group or the Company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\n## Auditors' responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors' report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nIrregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design procedures in line with our responsibilities, outlined above, to detect material misstatements in respect of irregularities, including fraud. The extent to which our procedures are capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud, is detailed below.\n\nBased on our understanding of the Group and industry, we identified that the principal risks of non-compliance with laws and regulations related to patent protection, product safety (including but not limited to the US Food and Drug Administration regulation, the European Medicines Agency, the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, China Food and Drug Administration), antibribery and competition law (including but not limited to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the Proceeds of Crime Act and the provisions set out by the National Healthcare Security Administration in China), and we considered the extent to which non-compliance might have a material effect on the financial statements. We also considered those laws and regulations that have a direct impact on the financial statements such as the Companies Act 2006 and tax legislation. We evaluated management's incentives and opportunities for fraudulent manipulation of the financial statements (including the risk of override of controls), and determined that the principal risks were related to journal entries to manipulate financial results and potential management bias in accounting estimates. The Group engagement team shared this risk assessment with the component auditors so that they could include appropriate audit procedures in response to such risks in their work.\n\nAudit procedures performed by the Group engagement team and/or component auditors included:\n\n- > Evaluation and testing of the design and operating effectiveness of management's controls to prevent and detect irregularities;\n- > Discussions with VP Group Internal Audit, the Deputy Chief Compliance Officer, the Head of Global Investigations and the Group's General Counsel and Deputy General Counsels along with other members of Group legal and external counsel where applicable, including consideration of known or suspected instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations and fraud;\n- > Assessment of matters reported on the Group's whistleblowing helpline and the results of management's investigation of such matters;\n- > Challenging assumptions made by management in its significant accounting estimates, in particular in relation to the recognition and measurement of certain rebate accruals in the US (excluding Rare Diseases), the impairment of intangible assets (excluding goodwill and software development costs), the recognition and measurement of legal provisions and disclosure of contingent liabilities, the recognition and measurement of uncertain tax treatments, and the valuation of the defined benefit obligations (see related key audit matters above); and\n- > Identifying and testing the validity of journal entries, in particular any journal entries posted with unusual account combinations, and consolidation journals.\n\nThere are inherent limitations in the audit procedures described above. We are less likely to become aware of instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations that are not closely related to events and transactions reflected in the financial statements. Also, the risk of not detecting a material misstatement due to fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting one resulting from error, as fraud may involve deliberate concealment by, for example, forgery or intentional misrepresentations, or through collusion.\n\nOur audit testing might include testing complete populations of certain transactions and balances, possibly using data auditing techniques. However, it typically involves selecting a limited number of items for testing, rather than testing complete populations. We will often seek to target particular items for testing based on their size or risk characteristics. In other cases, we will use audit sampling to enable us to draw a conclusion about the population from which the sample is selected.\n\nA further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the FRC's website at: www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditors' report.\n\n## Use of this report\n\nThis report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the Company's members as a body in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.\n\n## Other required reporting\n\n## Companies Act 2006 exception reporting\n\nUnder the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:\n\n- > we have not obtained all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or\n- > adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from branches not visited by us; or\n- > certain disclosures of directors' remuneration specified by law are not made; or\n- > the Company financial statements and the part of the Directors' Remuneration Report to be audited are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns.\n\nWe have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility.\n\n## Appointment\n\nFollowing the recommendation of the Audit Committee, we were appointed by the members on 27 April 2017 to audit the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2017 and subsequent financial periods. The period of total uninterrupted engagement is seven years, covering the years ended 31 December 2017 to 31 December 2023.\n\n## Other matter\n\nAs required by the Financial Conduct Authority Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rule 4.1.14R, these financial statements form part of the ESEFprepared annual financial report filed on the National Storage Mechanism of the Financial Conduct Authority in accordance with the ESEF Regulatory Technical Standard ('ESEF RTS').

        "page_content": "## Group Accounting Policies\n\n## Basis of accounting and preparation of financial information\n\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, modified to include revaluation to fair value of certain financial instruments and pension plan assets and liabilities as described below, in accordance with UK-adopted international accounting standards and with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 as applicable to companies reporting under those standards. The Consolidated Financial Statements also comply fully with IFRS Accounting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and International Accounting Standards as adopted by the European Union.\n\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements are presented in US dollars, which is the Company's functional currency.\n\nIn preparing their individual financial statements, the accounting policies of some overseas subsidiaries do not conform with IASBissued IFRSs. Therefore, where appropriate, adjustments are made in order to present the Consolidated Financial Statements on a consistent basis.\n\n## New accounting requirements\n\nOther than noted below, amendments to accounting standards issued by the IASB and adopted in the year ended 31 December 2023 did not have a material impact on the result or financial position of the Group.\n\n## IAS 12\n\nOn 23 May 2023, the IASB issued an amendment to IAS 12 'Income Taxes' to clarify how the effects of the global minimum tax framework should be accounted for and disclosed effective 1 January 2023. This was endorsed by the UK Endorsement Board on 19 July 2023 and has been adopted by the Group for 2023 reporting. The Group has applied the exemption to recognising and disclosing information about deferred tax assets and liabilities related to Pillar 2 income taxes.\n\n## Alliance and Collaboration Revenue\n\nEffective 1 January 2023, the Group has updated the presentation of Total Revenue on the face of the Statement of Comprehensive Income to include Alliance Revenue as a separate element to Collaboration Revenue. Alliance Revenue, previously reported within Collaboration Revenue, comprises income related to sales made by collaboration partners, where AstraZeneca is entitled to a share of gross profits, share of revenues or royalties, which are recurring in nature while the collaboration arrangement remains in place. Alliance Revenue does not include Product Sales where AstraZeneca is leading commercialisation in a territory.\n\nCollaboration Revenue arising from collaborative arrangements where the Group retains a significant ongoing economic interest and receives upfront amounts and eventtriggered milestones, which arise from the licensing of intellectual property, will continue to be reported as Collaboration Revenue. In collaboration arrangements either AstraZeneca or the collaborator acts as principal in sales to the end customer. Where AstraZeneca acts as principal, AstraZeneca records 100% of sales to the end customer within Product Sales. The updated presentation reflects the increasing importance of income arising from share of gross profit arrangements where collaboration partners are responsible for booking revenues in some or all territories.\n\nThe comparative revenue reported in the years to 31 December 2022 and 31 December 2021 has been retrospectively adjusted to reflect the new split of Total Revenue, resulting in Alliance Revenue being reported for the year to 31 December 2022 of $755m and to 31 December 2021 of $388m, however the combined total of Alliance Revenue and Collaboration Revenue is equal to the previously reported Collaboration Revenue total for each prior year.\n\n## Basis for preparation of Financial Statements on a going concern basis\n\nThe Group has considerable financial resources available. As at 31 December 2023, the Group has $12.7bn in financial resources (Cash and cash equivalent balances of $5.8bn and undrawn committed bank facilities of $6.9bn, of which $2.0bn are available until February 2025 and the remaining $4.9bn are available until April 2026, (in February 2024 these facilities were extended to April 2029), with only $5.4bn of borrowings due within one year).\n\nThe Group's revenues are largely derived from sales of medicines covered by patents, which provide a relatively high level of resilience and predictability to cash inflows, although government price interventions in response to budgetary constraints are expected to continue to adversely affect revenues in some of our significant markets. The Group, however, anticipates new revenue streams from both recently launched medicines and those in development, and the Group has a wide diversity of customers and suppliers across different geographic areas.\n\nConsequently, the Directors believe that, overall, the Group is well placed to manage its business risks successfully. Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the Annual Report and Financial Statements.\n\n## Estimates and judgements\n\nThe preparation of the Financial Statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and judgements that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the Financial Statements and the\n\nreported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe accounting policy descriptions set out the areas where judgements and estimates need exercising, the most significant of which include the following Key Judgements and Significant Estimates :\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- >  revenue recognition - see Revenue Accounting Policy from page 152 and Note 1 on page 161\n- >  expensing of internal development expenses - see Research and Development Policy from page 154\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- >  impairment reviews of Intangible assets - see Note 10 on page 174\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- >  useful economic life of Intangible assets see Research and Development Policy from page 154\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- >  business combinations and Goodwill see Business Combinations and Goodwill Policy from page 156 and Note 27 from page 193\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- >  litigation liabilities - see Litigation and Environmental Liabilities within Note 30 on page 204\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- >  operating segments - see Note 6 on page 167\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- >  employee benefits - see Note 22 on page 190\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- >  taxation - see Note 30 from page 209\n\n.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Group has assessed the impact of climate risk on its financial reporting. The impact assessment was primarily focused on the valuation and useful lives of intangible assets and the identification and valuation of provisions and contingent liabilities, as these are judged to be the key areas that could be impacted by climate risks. No material accounting impacts or changes to judgements or other required disclosures were noted.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nKey Judgements are those judgements made in applying the Group's accounting policies that have a material effect on the amounts of assets and liabilities recognised in the Financial Statements.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nA Significant Estimate has a significant risk of material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year.\n\nFinancial risk management policies are detailed in Note 28 to the Financial Statements from page 195.\n\nAstraZeneca's management considers the following to be the material accounting policies in the context of the Group's operations.\n\n## Revenue\n\nRevenue comprises Product Sales, Alliance Revenue and Collaboration Revenue.\n\nRevenue excludes inter-company revenues and value-added taxes.",

        "page_content": "## Product Sales\n\nProduct Sales represent net invoice value less estimated rebates, returns and chargebacks, which are considered to be variable consideration and include significant estimates. Sales are recognised when the control of the goods has been transferred to a third party. This is usually when title passes to the customer, either on shipment or on receipt of goods by the customer, depending on local trading terms. Revenue is not recognised in full until it is highly probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognised will not occur.\n\nRebates are amounts payable or credited to a customer, usually based on the quantity or value of Product Sales to the customer for specific products in a certain period. Product sales rebates, which relate to Product Sales that occur over a period of time, are normally issued retrospectively.\n\nAt the time Product Sales are invoiced, rebates and deductions that the Group expects to pay are estimated based upon assumptions developed using contractual terms, historical experience and market-related information. The rebates and deductions are recognised as variable consideration and recorded as a reduction to revenue with an accrual recorded. These rebates typically arise from sales contracts with government payers, third-party managed care organisations, hospitals, long-term care facilities, group purchasing organisations and various state programmes.\n\nIn markets where returns are significant, estimates of the quantity and value of goods which may ultimately be returned are accounted for at the point revenue is recognised. Our returns accruals are based on actual experience over the preceding 12 months for established products together with market-related information such as estimated stock levels at wholesalers and competitor activity which we receive via third-party information services. For newly launched products, we use rates based on our experience with similar products or a predetermined percentage.\n\nWhen a product faces generic competition, particular attention is given to the possible levels of returns and, in cases where the circumstances are such that the level of Product Sales are considered highly probable to reverse, revenues are only recognised when the right of return expires, which is generally on ultimate prescription of the product to patients.\n\nThe methodology and assumptions used to estimate rebates and returns are monitored and adjusted regularly in the light of contractual and legal obligations, historical trends, past experience and projected market conditions. Once the uncertainty associated with returns is resolved, revenue is adjusted accordingly.\n\nUnder certain collaboration agreements which include a profit sharing mechanism, our recognition of Product Sales depends on which party acts as principal in sales to the end customer. In the cases where AstraZeneca acts as principal, we record 100% of sales to the end customer. In the cases where AstraZeneca does not act as principal, we record the share of gross profits received within Alliance Revenue.\n\nContracts relating to the supply of certain Vaccines & Immune Therapies medicines relating to the COVID-19 pandemic include conditions whereby payments are receivable from customers in advance of the delivery of product. Such amounts are held on the balance sheet as contract liabilities until the related revenue is recognised, generally upon product delivery. Certain of these contracts contain further provisions that restrict the use of inventory manufactured in specified supply chains to specified customers, resulting in an enforceable right to payment as the activities are performed. Under IFRS 15, such contracts require revenue to be recognised over time using an appropriate and reasonably measurable method to measure progress. Revenue is recognised on these contracts based on the proportion of product delivered compared to the total contracted volumes.\n\nCertain arrangements include bill-and-hold arrangements under which the Group invoices a customer for a product but retains physical possession of the product until it is transferred to the customer at a point in time in the future. For these types of arrangements, an assessment is made to determine when the performance obligation has been satisfied, which is when control of the product is transferred to the customer. If the customer has obtained control of the product even though that product remains in the Group's physical possession, the performance obligation to transfer a product has been satisfied and Product Sales are recognised. Control is considered to have transferred when the reason for the bill-and-hold arrangement is substantive, the product can be identified separately as belonging to the customer, the product is ready for physical transfer to the customer and AstraZeneca is unable to use or sell the product to another customer.\n\n## Alliance Revenue\n\nAlliance Revenue comprises income arising from the ongoing operation of collaborative arrangements related to sales made by collaboration partners, where AstraZeneca is entitled to a share of gross profits, share of revenues or royalties, which are recurring in nature while the collaboration agreement remains in place. Alliance Revenue does not include Product Sales where AstraZeneca is leading commercialisation in a territory, or reimbursement for AstraZeneca-incurred expenses such as R&D or promotion costs, which arise from the license of intellectual property.\n\nThe Group periodically enters into transactions where it acquires part of the rights to a product intangible (either on-market or in-process R&D), but for commercial reasons does not act as principal in selling the product to the customer and therefore does not recognise income from the product in the form of Product Sales. This may occur where, for example, a collaboration partner retains the right to commercialise in a specific territory, and has sufficient local control over that commercialisation to book Product Sales, while the Group instead receives a proportion of the value generated by those Product Sales, either in the form of a royalty, a share of gross profits or a share of revenues.\n\nWhere the arrangement meets the definition of a licence agreement, share of gross profits, share of revenues and sales royalties are recognised when achieved by applying the royalty exemption under IFRS 15. All other sales royalties are recognised when considered it is highly probable there will not be a significant reversal of cumulative income. The determination requires estimates to be made in relation to future Product Sales.\n\n## Collaboration Revenue\n\nCollaboration Revenue includes income arising from entering into collaborative arrangements where the Group has out-licensed (sold) certain rights associated with products and where AstraZeneca retains a significant ongoing economic interest in the product. Significant interest can include ongoing supply of finished goods, profit sharing arrangements or being principal in the sales of medicines. These collaborations may include development, manufacturing and/or commercialisation arrangements with the collaborator. Income from out-licences may take the form of upfront fees and milestones.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTiming of recognition of clinical and regulatory milestones is considered to be a key judgement. There can be significant uncertainty over whether it is highly probable that there would not be a significant reversal of revenue in respect of specific milestones if these are recognised before they are triggered due to them being subject to the actions of third parties. In general, where the triggering of a milestone is subject to the decisions of third parties (e.g. the acceptance or approval of a filing by a regulatory authority), the Group does not consider that the threshold for recognition is met until that decision is made.\n\nWhere Collaboration Revenue arises from the licensing of the Group's own intellectual property, the licences we grant are typically rights to use intellectual property which do not change during the period of the licence and therefore related non-conditional revenue is recognised at the point the licence is granted and variable consideration as soon as recognition criteria are met.",

These arrangements typically involve the receipt of an upfront payment, which the contract attributes to the license of the intangible assets, and ongoing receipts for supply, which the contract attributes to the sale of the product we manufacture. In cases where the transaction has two or more components, we account for the delivered item (for example, the transfer of title to the intangible asset) as a separate unit of account and record revenue on delivery of that component. Where practicable, consideration is allocated to performance obligations on the basis of the standalone selling price of each performance obligation. However, where there is a licence of intellectual property, it is not always possible to establish a reliable estimate of the standalone selling price of the licence as they are unique. Therefore, in these rare situations, the residual approach is used to determine the consideration attributable to the licence.\n\nWhere fixed amounts are payable over one year from the effective date of a contract, an assessment is made as to whether a significant financing component exists, and if so, the fair value of this component is deferred and recognised as financing income over the period to the expected date of receipt.\n\nWhere control of a right to use licence for an intangible asset passes at the outset of an arrangement, revenue is recognised at the point in time control is transferred. Where the substance of a licence arrangement is that of a right to access rights attributable to an intangible asset, revenue, in the form of an upfront fee, is recognised over time, normally on a straight-line basis over the life of the contract. Where the Group provides ongoing development services, revenue in respect of this element is recognised over the duration of those services.\n\nWhere Collaboration Revenue is recorded and there is a related intangible asset that is licensed as part of the arrangement, an appropriate amount of that intangible asset is charged to Cost of sales based on an allocation of cost or value to the rights that have been licensed.\n\n## Cost of sales\n\nCost of sales are recognised as the associated revenue is recognised. Cost of sales include manufacturing costs, royalties payable on revenues recognised, movements in provisions for inventories, inventory write-offs and impairment charges in relation to manufacturing assets. Cost of sales also includes co-collaborator sharing of profit arising from collaborations, and foreign exchange gains and losses arising from business trading activities.\n\n## Research and development\n\nResearch expenditure is charged to profit and loss in the year in which it is incurred.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nInternal development expenditure is capitalised only if it meets the recognition criteria of IAS 38 'Intangible Assets'. This is considered a key judgement. Where regulatory and other uncertainties are such that the criteria are not met, the expenditure is charged to profit and loss and this is almost invariably the case prior to approval of the drug by the relevant regulatory authority. Where, however, recognition criteria are met, Intangible assets are capitalised and amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful economic lives from product launch. At 31 December 2023, no amounts have met the recognition criteria.\n\nPayments to in-license products and compounds from third parties for new research and development projects (in process research and development) generally take the form of upfront payments, milestones and royalty payments. Where payments made to third parties represent consideration for future research and development activities, an evaluation is made as to the nature of the payments. Such payments are expensed if they represent compensation for sub-contracted research and development services not resulting in a transfer of intellectual property. By contrast, payments are capitalised if they represent compensation for the transfer of identifiable intellectual property developed at the risk of the third party. Such payments may be made once development or regulatory milestones are met and may also be made on the basis of sales volumes once a product is launched. Development and regulatory milestone payments are capitalised as the milestone is triggered. Sales-related payments are accrued and capitalised with reference to the latest Group sales forecasts for approved indications at the present value of expected future cash flows. Assets capitalised are amortised, on a straight-line basis, over their useful economic lives from product launch.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe determination of useful economic life is considered to be a key judgement. On product launch, the Group makes a judgement as to the expected useful economic life with reference to the expiry of associated patents for the product, expectation around the competitive environment specific to the product and our detailed long-term risk-adjusted sales projections compiled annually across the Group and approved by the Board.\n\nThe useful economic life can extend beyond patent expiry dependent upon the nature of the product and the complexity of the development and manufacturing process. Significant sales can often be achieved post patent expiration.\n\n## Intangible assets\n\nIntangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairments. Intangible assets relating to products in development are subject to impairment testing annually. All Intangible assets are tested for impairment when there are indications that the carrying value may not be recoverable. The determination of the recoverable amounts include key estimates which are highly sensitive to, and depend upon, key assumptions as detailed in Note 10 to the Financial Statements from page 172.\n\nImpairment reviews have been carried out on all Intangible assets that are in development (and not being amortised), all major intangible assets acquired during the year and all other intangible assets that have had indicators of impairment during the year. Recoverable amount is determined as the higher of value-inuse or fair value less costs to sell using a discounted cash flow calculation, with the products' expected cash flows risk-adjusted over their estimated remaining useful economic life. Sales forecasts and specific allocated costs (which have both been subject to appropriate senior management review and approval) are risk-adjusted and discounted using appropriate rates based on our post-tax weighted average cost of capital or for fair value less costs to sell, a required rate of return for a market participant. Our weighted average cost of capital reflects factors such as our capital structure and our costs of debt and equity.\n\nAny impairment losses are recognised immediately in Operating profit. Intangible assets relating to products which fail during development (or for which development ceases for other reasons) are also tested for impairment and are written down to their recoverable amount (which is usually nil).\n\nIf, subsequent to an impairment loss being recognised, development restarts or other facts and circumstances change indicating that the impairment is less or no longer exists, the value of the asset is re-estimated and its carrying value is increased to the recoverable amount, but not exceeding the original value, by recognising an impairment reversal in Operating profit.\n\n## Government grants\n\nGovernment grants are recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income so as to match with the related expenses that they are intended to compensate. Where grants are received in advance of the related expenses, they are initially recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position under Trade and other payables as deferred income and released to net off against the related expenditure when incurred.",

        "page_content": "Each contract is assessed to determine whether there are both grant elements and supply of product which need to be separated. In each case, the contracts set out the specified terms for the supply of the product and the provisions for funding for certain costs, primarily research and development associated with the IP. It is considered whether there are any conditions for the funding to be refunded. The consideration in the contract is allocated between the grant and supply elements. The standalone selling price for the supply of products is determined by reference to observed prices with other customers. The amount allocated as a government grant is determined by reference to the specific agreed costs and activities identified in the contract as not directly attributable to the supply of product. Government grants are recorded as an offset to the relevant expense in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income and are capped to match the relevant costs incurred.\n\n## Other operating income and expense\n\nOther operating income and expense is generated from activities outside of the Group's normal course of business, which includes Other income from divestments of or full out-license of assets and businesses including royalties and milestones where the Group does not retain a significant continued interest. Where the arrangement meets the definition of a licence agreement, sales milestones and sales royalties are recognised when achieved by applying the royalty exemption under IFRS 15. All other milestones and sales royalties are recognised when it is considered highly probable that there will not be a significant reversal of cumulative income. The determination requires estimates to be made in relation to future Product Sales.\n\n## Joint arrangements and associates\n\nThe Group has arrangements over which it has joint control and which qualify as joint operations or joint ventures under IFRS 11 'Joint Arrangements'. For joint operations, the Group recognises its share of revenue that it earns from the joint operations and its share of expenses incurred. The Group also recognises the assets associated with the joint operations that it controls and the liabilities it incurs under the joint arrangement. For joint ventures and associates, the Group recognises its interest in the joint venture or associate as an investment and uses the equity method of accounting.\n\n## Employee benefits\n\nThe Group accounts for pensions and other employee benefits (principally healthcare) under IAS 19 'Employee Benefits'. In respect of defined benefit plans, obligations are determined using the projected unit credit method and are discounted to present value by reference to market yields on high-quality corporate bonds, while plan assets are measured at fair value. Given the extent of the assumptions used to determine the value of scheme assets and scheme liabilities, these\n\nare considered to be significant estimates. The operating and financing costs of such plans are recognised separately in profit; current service costs are spread systematically over the lives of employees and financing costs are recognised in full in the periods in which they arise. Remeasurements of the net defined benefit pension liability, including actuarial gains and losses, are recognised immediately in Other comprehensive income.\n\nWhere the calculation results in a surplus to the Group, the recognised asset is limited to the present value of any available future refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan subject to consideration of the effect any minimum funding requirement for future service has on the benefit available as a reduction in future contributions.\n\nPayments to defined contribution plans are recognised in profit as they fall due.\n\n## Taxation\n\nThe current tax payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from reported profit because taxable profit excludes items that are either never taxable or tax deductible or items that are taxable or tax deductible in a different period. The Group's current tax assets and liabilities are calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date.\n\nDeferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. Deferred tax liabilities are recognised unless they arise from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit. Deferred tax liabilities are not recognised to the extent they arise from the initial recognition of non-tax deductible goodwill. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that there are future taxable temporary differences or it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the asset can be utilised. This requires judgements to be made in respect of the availability of future taxable income.\n\nNo deferred tax asset or liability is recognised in respect of temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries and branches where the Group is able to control the timing of reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.\n\nThe Group's deferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated using tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset realised based on tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date.\n\nDeferred tax liabilities relating to assets recognised because of a business combination which may qualify for intellectual property incentives are measured at the relevant statutory tax rate. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position if, and only if, the taxable entity has a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets and liabilities, and the Deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to taxes levied by the same taxation authority on the same taxable entity.\n\nLiabilities for uncertain tax positions require management to make judgements of potential exposures in relation to tax audit issues. Tax benefits are not recognised unless the tax positions will probably be accepted by the tax authorities. This is based upon management's interpretation of applicable laws and regulations and the expectation of how the tax authority will resolve the matter. Once considered probable of not being accepted, management reviews each material tax benefit and reflects the effect of the uncertainty in determining the related taxable result.\n\nLiabilities for uncertain tax positions are measured using either the most likely amount or the expected value amount depending on which method the entity expects to better predict the resolution of the uncertainty.\n\nFurther details of the estimates and assumptions made in determining our recorded liability for transfer pricing contingencies and other tax contingencies are included in Note 30 to the Financial Statements from page 204.\n\n## Share-based payments\n\nAll plans have been classified as equity settled after assessment. The grant date fair value of the market-based performance elements of employee share plan awards is calculated using a modified Monte Carlo model, with other elements at market price. In accordance with IFRS 2 'Share-based Payment', the resulting cost is recognised in profit on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of the awards. The value of the charge is adjusted to reflect expected and actual levels of awards vesting, except where the failure to vest is as a result of not meeting a market condition. Cancellations of equity instruments are treated as an acceleration of the vesting period and any outstanding charge is recognised in profit immediately.\n\nCash outflows relating to the vesting of share plans for our employees are recognised within operating activities, as they relate to employee remuneration. The cash flows relating to replacement awards issued to employees as part of the Alexion acquisition (see Note 27 from page 193) are classified within investing activities, as they are part of the aggregate cash flows arising from obtaining control of the subsidiary.",

        "page_content": "## Group Accounting Policies\n\n## continued\n\n## Property, plant and equipment\n\nThe Group's policy is to depreciate the difference between the cost of each item of Property, plant and equipment and its residual value over its estimated useful life on a straight-line basis. Assets under construction are not depreciated until the asset is available for use, at which point the asset is transferred into either Land and buildings or Plant and equipment, and depreciated over its estimated useful economic life.\n\nReviews are made annually of the estimated remaining lives and residual values of individual productive assets, taking account of commercial and technological obsolescence as well as normal wear and tear. It is impractical to calculate average asset lives exactly. However, the useful economic lives range from approximately 10 to 50 years for buildings, and three to 15 years for plant and equipment. All items of Property, plant and equipment are tested for impairment when there are indications that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Any impairment losses are recognised immediately in Operating profit.\n\n## Leases\n\nThe Group's lease arrangements are principally for property, most notably a portfolio of office premises and employee accommodation, and for a global car fleet, utilised primarily by our sales and marketing teams.\n\nThe lease liability and corresponding right-of-use asset arising from a lease are initially measured on a present value basis. Lease liabilities include the net present value of the following lease payments:\n\n- >  fixed payments, less any lease incentives receivable\n- >  variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, initially measured using the index or rate as at the commencement date\n- >  the exercise price of a purchase option if the Group is reasonably certain to exercise that option\n- >  payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the Group exercising that option, and\n- >  amounts expected to be payable by the Group under residual value guarantees.\n\nRight-of-use assets are measured at cost comprising the following:\n\n- >  the amount of the initial measurement of lease liability\n- >  any lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received\n- >  any initial direct costs, and\n- >  restoration costs.\n\nJudgements made in calculating the lease liability include assessing whether arrangements contain a lease and determining the lease term. Lease terms are negotiated on an individual basis and contain a wide range of different terms and conditions. Property leases will often include an early termination or extension option to the lease term. Fleet management policies vary by jurisdiction and may include renewal of a lease until a measurement threshold, such as mileage, is reached. Extension and termination options have been considered when determining the lease term, along with all facts and circumstances that may create an economic incentive to exercise an extension option, or not exercise a termination option. Extension periods (or periods after termination options) are only included in the lease term if the lease is reasonably certain to be extended (or not terminated).\n\nThe lease payments are discounted using incremental borrowing rates, as in the majority of leases held by the Group the interest rate implicit in the lease is not readily identifiable. Calculating the discount rate is an estimate made in calculating the lease liability. This rate is the rate that the Group would have to pay to borrow the funds necessary to obtain an asset of similar value to the right-of-use asset in a similar economic environment with similar terms, security and conditions. To determine the incremental borrowing rate, the Group uses a risk-free interest rate adjusted for credit risk, adjusting for terms specific to the lease including term, country and currency.\n\nThe Group is exposed to potential future increases in variable lease payments that are based on an index or rate, which are initially measured as at the commencement date, with any future changes in the index or rate excluded from the lease liability until they take effect. When adjustments to lease payments based on an index or rate take effect, the lease liability is reassessed and adjusted against the right-of-use asset.\n\nLease payments are allocated between principal and finance cost. The finance cost is charged to the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income over the lease period so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability for each period.\n\nPayments associated with short-term leases of Property, plant and equipment and all leases of low-value assets are recognised on a straight-line basis as an expense in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income. Short-term leases are leases with a lease term of 12 months or less. Low-value leases are those where the underlying asset value, when new, is $5,000 or less and includes IT equipment and small items of office furniture.\n\nContracts may contain both lease and non-lease components. The Group allocates the consideration in the contract to the lease and non-lease components based on their relative standalone prices.\n\nRight-of-use assets are generally depreciated over the shorter of the asset's useful life and the lease term on a straight-line basis. If the Group is reasonably certain to exercise a purchase option, the right-of-use asset is depreciated over the underlying asset's useful life. It is impractical to calculate average asset lives exactly. However, the total lives range from approximately 10 to 50 years for buildings, and three to 15 years for motor vehicles and other assets.\n\nThere are no material lease agreements under which the Group is a lessor.\n\n## Business combinations and goodwill\n\nIn assessing whether an acquired set of assets and activities is a business or an asset, management will first elect whether to apply an optional concentration test to simplify the assessment. Where the concentration test is applied, the acquisition will be treated as the acquisition of an asset if substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired (excluding cash and cash equivalents, deferred tax assets, and related goodwill) is concentrated in a single asset or group of similar identifiable assets.\n\nWhere the concentration test is not applied, or is not met, a further assessment of whether the acquired set of assets and activities is a business will be performed.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe determination of whether an acquired set of assets and activities is a business or an asset can be judgemental, particularly if the target is not producing outputs. Management uses a number of factors to make this determination, which are primarily focused on whether the acquired set of assets and activities include substantive processes that mean the set is capable of being managed for the purpose of providing a return. Key determining factors include the stage of development of any assets acquired, the readiness and ability of the acquired set to produce outputs and the presence of key experienced employees capable of conducting activities required to develop or manufacture the assets. Typically, the specialised nature of many pharmaceutical assets and processes is such that until assets are substantively ready for production and promotion, there are not the required processes for a set of assets and activities to meet the definition of a business in IFRS 3.",

        "page_content": "On the acquisition of a business, fair values are attributed to the identifiable assets and liabilities. Attributing fair values is a key judgement; refer to Note 27 to the Financial Statements from page 193 for additional details. Contingent liabilities are also recorded at fair value unless the fair value cannot be measured reliably, in which case the value is subsumed into goodwill. Where fair values of acquired contingent liabilities cannot be measured reliably, the assumed contingent liability is not recognised but is disclosed in the same manner as other contingent liabilities.\n\nWhere not all of the equity of a subsidiary is acquired, the non-controlling interest is recognised either at fair value or at the non-controlling interest's proportionate share of the net assets of the subsidiary, on a case-by-case basis. Put options over non-controlling interests are recognised as a financial liability, with a corresponding entry in either Retained earnings or against noncontrolling interest reserves on a case-bycase basis.\n\nThe timing and amount of future contingent elements of consideration is an estimate. Contingent consideration, which may include development and launch milestones, revenue threshold milestones and revenue-based royalties, is fair valued at the date of acquisition using decision-tree analysis with key inputs including probability of success, consideration of potential delays and revenue projections based on the Group's internal forecasts. Unsettled amounts of consideration are held at fair value within payables with changes in fair value recognised immediately in profit.\n\nGoodwill is the difference between the fair value of the consideration and the fair value of net assets acquired.\n\nGoodwill arising on acquisitions is capitalised and subject to an impairment review, both annually and when there is an indication that the carrying value may not be recoverable.\n\nThe Group's policy up to and including 1997 was to eliminate Goodwill arising upon acquisitions against reserves. Under IFRS 1 'First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards' and IFRS 3 'Business Combinations', such Goodwill will remain eliminated against reserves.\n\n## Subsidiaries\n\nA subsidiary is an entity controlled, directly or indirectly, by AstraZeneca PLC. Control is regarded as the exposure or rights to the variable returns of the entity when combined with the power to affect those returns. Control is normally evidenced by holding more than 50% of the share capital of the company, however other agreements may be in place that result in control where they give AstraZeneca finance decision-making authority over the relevant activities of the company.\n\nThe financial results of subsidiaries are consolidated from the date control is obtained until the date that control ceases.\n\n## Inventories\n\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. The first in, first out or an average method of valuation is used. For finished goods and work in progress, cost includes directly attributable costs and certain overhead expenses (including depreciation). Selling expenses and certain other overhead expenses (principally central administration costs) are excluded. Net realisable value is determined as estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in selling and distribution.\n\nWrite-downs of inventory occur in the general course of business and are recognised in Cost of sales for launched or approved products and in Research and development expense for products in development.\n\n## Assets held for sale\n\nNon-current assets are classified as Assets held for sale when their carrying amount is to be recovered principally through a sale transaction and a sale is considered highly probable. A sale is considered highly probable only when the appropriate level of management has committed to the sale.\n\nAssets held for sale are stated at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. Where there is a partial transfer of a non-current asset to held for sale, an allocation of value is made between the current and non-current portions of the asset based on the relative value of the two portions, unless there is a methodology that better reflects the asset to be disposed of.\n\nAssets held for sale are neither depreciated nor amortised.\n\n## Trade and other receivables\n\nFinancial assets included in Trade and other receivables are recognised initially at fair value. The Group holds the Trade receivables with the objective to collect the contractual cash flows and therefore measures them subsequently at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment, based on expected credit losses.\n\nTrade receivables that are subject to debt factoring arrangements are derecognised if they meet the conditions for derecognition detailed in IFRS 9 'Financial Instruments'.\n\n## Trade and other payables\n\nFinancial liabilities included in Trade and other payables are recognised initially at fair value. Subsequent to initial recognition they are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Contingent consideration payables are held at fair value within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy as defined in Note 12.\n\n## Financial instruments\n\nThe Group's financial instruments include Lease liabilities, Trade and other receivables and payables, liabilities for contingent consideration and put options under business combinations, and rights and obligations under employee benefit plans which are dealt with in specific accounting policies.\n\nThe Group's other financial instruments include:\n\n- >  Cash and cash equivalents\n- >  Fixed deposits\n- >  Other investments\n- >  Bank and other borrowings\n- >  Derivatives.\n\n## Cash and cash equivalents\n\nCash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand, current balances with banks and similar institutions, and highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less when acquired. They are readily convertible into known amounts of cash and are held at amortised cost under the hold to collect classification, where they meet the hold to collect 'solely payments of principal and interest' test criteria under IFRS 9. Those not meeting these criteria are held at fair value through profit or loss. Cash and cash equivalents in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows include unsecured bank overdrafts at the balance sheet date where balances often fluctuate between a cash and overdraft position.\n\n## Fixed deposits\n\nFixed deposits, principally comprising funds held with banks and other financial institutions, are initially measured at fair value, plus direct transaction costs, and are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method at each reporting date. Changes in carrying value are recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.\n\n## Other investments\n\nInvestments are classified as fair value through profit or loss (FVPL), unless the Group makes an irrevocable election at initial recognition for certain non-current equity investments to present changes in Other comprehensive income (FVOCI). If this election is made, there is no subsequent reclassification of fair value gains and losses to profit or loss following the derecognition of the investment.\n\n## Bank and other borrowings\n\nThe Group uses derivatives, principally interest rate swaps, to hedge the interest rate exposure inherent in a portion of its fixed interest rate debt. In such cases the Group will either designate the debt as FVPL when certain criteria are met or as the hedged item under a fair value hedge.",

        "page_content": "## Group Accounting Policies\n\n## continued\n\nIf the debt instrument is designated as FVPL, the debt is initially measured at fair value (with direct transaction costs being included in profit as an expense) and is remeasured to fair value at each reporting date with changes in carrying value being recognised in profit (along with changes in the fair value of the related derivative), with the exception of changes in the fair value of the debt instrument relating to own credit risk which are recorded in Other comprehensive income in accordance with IFRS 9. Such a designation has been made where this significantly reduces an accounting mismatch which would result from recognising gains and losses on different bases.\n\nIf the debt is designated as the hedged item under a fair value hedge, the debt is initially measured at fair value (with direct transaction costs being amortised over the life of the debt) and is remeasured for fair value changes in respect of the hedged risk at each reporting date with changes in carrying value being recognised in profit (along with changes in the fair value of the related derivative).\n\nIf the debt is designated in a cash flow hedge, the debt is measured at amortised cost (with gains or losses taken to profit and direct transaction costs being amortised over the life of the debt). The related derivative is remeasured for fair value changes at each reporting date with the portion of the gain or loss on the derivative that is determined to be an effective hedge recognised in Other comprehensive income. The amounts that have been recognised in Other comprehensive income are reclassified to profit in the same period that the hedged forecast cash flows affect profit. The reclassification adjustment is included in Finance expense in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.\n\nOther interest-bearing loans are initially measured at fair value (with direct transaction costs being amortised over the life of the loan) and are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method at each reporting date. Changes in carrying value are recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.\n\n## Derivatives\n\nDerivatives are initially measured at fair value (with direct transaction costs being included in profit as an expense) and are subsequently remeasured to fair value at each reporting date. Changes in carrying value of derivatives not designated in hedging relationships are recognised in profit or loss.\n\nThe Group has agreements with some bank counterparties whereby the parties agree to post cash collateral, for the benefit of the other, equivalent to the market valuation of all of the derivative positions above a predetermined threshold. Cash collateral received from counterparties is included within current Interest-bearing loans and borrowings within the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position.\n\nCash collateral pledged to counterparties is recognised as a financial asset and is included in current Other investments within the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position. Cash collateral received is included in Movement in short-term borrowings within financing activities in the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement. Cash collateral paid is included in Movements in short-term investments within investing activities in the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement. The cash flow presentation of cash paid and received follows the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position presentation of the financial asset and financial liability that is recognised from posting the collateral.\n\n## Foreign currencies\n\nForeign currency transactions, being transactions denominated in a currency other than an individual Group entity's functional currency, are translated into the relevant functional currencies of individual Group entities at average rates for the relevant monthly accounting periods, which approximate to actual rates.\n\nMonetary assets and liabilities arising from foreign currency transactions are retranslated at exchange rates prevailing at the reporting date. Exchange gains and losses on loans and on short-term foreign currency borrowings and deposits are included within Finance expense. Exchange differences on all other foreign currency transactions are recognised in Operating profit in the individual Group entity's accounting records.\n\nNon-monetary items arising from foreign currency transactions are not retranslated in the individual Group entity's accounting records.\n\nIn the Consolidated Financial Statements, income and expense items for Group entities with a functional currency other than US dollars are translated into US dollars at average exchange rates, which approximate to actual rates, for the relevant accounting periods. Assets and liabilities are translated at the US dollar exchange rates prevailing at the reporting date. Exchange differences arising on consolidation are recognised in Other comprehensive income.\n\nIf certain criteria are met, non-US dollardenominated loans or derivatives are designated as net investment hedges of foreign operations. Exchange differences arising on retranslation of net investments, and of foreign currency loans which are designated in an effective net investment hedge relationship, are recognised in Other comprehensive income in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Foreign exchange derivatives hedging net investments in foreign operations are carried at fair value. Effective fair value movements are recognised in Other comprehensive income, with any ineffectiveness taken to profit. Gains and losses accumulated in the translation reserve will be recycled to profit and loss when the foreign operation is sold.\n\n## Provisions\n\nProvisions are recognised when there is either a legal or constructive present obligation as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of economic resources will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are discounted at the relevant pre-tax discount rate. Where provisions are discounted, the increase in the provision resulting from the passage of time is recognised as a finance cost.\n\n## Litigation and environmental liabilities\n\nAstraZeneca is involved in legal disputes, the settlement of which may involve cost to the Group. A provision is made where an adverse outcome is probable and associated costs, including related legal costs, can be estimated reliably. Determining the timing of recognition of when an adverse outcome is probable is considered a key judgement, refer to Note 30 to the Financial Statements from page 204.\n\nWhere it is considered that the Group is more likely than not to prevail, or in the extremely rare circumstances where the amount of the legal liability cannot be estimated reliably, legal costs involved in defending the claim are charged to the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income as they are incurred.\n\nWhere it is considered that the Group has a valid contract which provides the right to reimbursement (from insurance or otherwise) of legal costs and/or all or part of any loss incurred or for which a provision has been established, the amount expected to be received is recognised as an asset only when it is virtually certain.\n\nAstraZeneca is exposed to environmental liabilities relating to its past operations, principally in respect of soil and groundwater remediation costs. Provisions for these costs are made when there is a present obligation and where it is probable that expenditure on remedial work will be required and a reliable estimate can be made of the cost.\n\n## Restructuring\n\nRestructuring costs are incurred in programmes that are planned and controlled by the Group which materially change either the scope of a business undertaken by the Group, or the manner in which that business is conducted.\n\nA provision for restructuring costs is recognised when a detailed formal plan is in place and has either been announced to those affected or has started to be implemented.

        "page_content": "## Impairment\n\nThe carrying values of non-financial assets, other than Inventories and Deferred tax assets, are reviewed at least annually to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. For Goodwill, Intangible assets under development and for any other assets where such indication exists, the asset's recoverable amount is estimated based on the greater of its value in use and its fair value less cost to sell. In assessing the recoverable amount, the estimated future cash flows, adjusted for the risks associated with the probability of success specific to each asset, as well as inflationary impacts, are discounted to their present value using a nominal discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money, the general risks affecting the pharmaceutical industry and other risks specific to each asset. For the purpose of impairment testing, assets are grouped together into the smallest group of assets that generates cash inflows from continuing use that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets. Impairment losses are recognised immediately in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.\n\n## Applicable accounting standards and interpretations issued but not yet adopted\n\nAt the date of authorisation of these financial statements, certain new accounting standards and amendments were in issue relating to the following standards and interpretations but not yet adopted by the Group:\n\n- >  amendments to IAS 1 'Presentation of Financial Statements', effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2024 endorsed by the UK Endorsement Board (UKEB) on 21 July 2023\n- >  amendments to IFRS 16 'Leases', effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2024 - endorsed by the UKEB on 11 May 2023\n- >  amendments to IAS 7 'Statement of Cash Flows' and IFRS 7 'Financial Instruments: Disclosures', effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2024 - endorsed by the UKEB on 28 November 2023\n- >  amendments to IAS 21 'The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates', effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2025 - not endorsed by the UKEB.\n\nThese new standards, amendments and interpretations are not expected to have a significant impact on the Group's net results.",

When invoicing Product Sales in the US, we estimate the rebates and chargebacks we expect to pay and we consider there to be a significant estimate associated with the rebates for Managed Care, Medicaid and Medicare Part D. The total adjustment in respect of prior year net US Product Sales revenue in 2023 was 1.0% (2022: 1.3%; 2021: 1.5%); this represents the difference between our prior year estimates for rebates and chargebacks against actual amounts paid for the US business. The most significant of these relate to the Medicaid and state programmes with an adjustment in respect of prior year net US Product Sales revenue in 2023 of 0.3% (2022: 0.5%; 2021: 0.4%) and Managed Care and Medicare of 0.5% (2022: 0.8%; 2021: 0.7%).\n\nThe adjustment in respect of the prior year net US Product Sales revenue, excluding the Rare Disease therapy area in 2023, was 1.4% (2022: 1.6%; 2021: 1.8%), with Medicaid and state programmes of 0.4% (2022: 0.6%; 2021: 0.5%) and Managed Care and Medicare of 0.7% (2022: 1.1%; 2021: 0.8%).\n\nThese values demonstrate the level of sensitivity; further meaningful sensitivity is not able to be provided due to the large volume of variables that contribute to the overall rebates, chargebacks, returns and other revenue accruals. These variables include assumptions in respect of aggregate future sales levels, segment mix and customers' contractual performance, and in addition for Managed Care, US Medicaid and Medicare Part D, the channel inventory levels, and assumptions related to lag time. These assumptions are built up on a product-by-product and customer-by-customer basis, taking into account specific contract provisions coupled with expected performance, and are then aggregated into a weighted average rebate accrual rate for each of our products. Accrual rates are reviewed and adjusted on an as-needed basis. There may be further adjustments when actual rebates are invoiced based on utilisation information submitted to AstraZeneca (in the case of contractual rebates) and claims/invoices are received (in the case of regulatory rebates and chargebacks).\n\n## Alliance Revenue\n\n|                        | 2023 $m   | 2022 $m   | 2021 $m   |\n|------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| Enhertu                | 1,022     | 523       | 197       |\n| Tezspire               | 259       | 79        | -         |\n| Beyfortus              | 57        | -         | -         |\n| Vaxzevria : royalties  | -         | 76        | 64        |\n| Other royalty income   | 81        | 68        | 70        |\n| Other Alliance Revenue | 9         | 9         | 57        |\n|                        | 1,428     | 755       | 388       |\n\n## Collaboration Revenue\n\n|                                   | 2023 $m   | 2022 $m   | 2021 $m   |\n|-----------------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| Lynparza : regulatory milestones  | 245       | 355       | -         |\n| Lynparza : sales milestones       | -         | -         | 400       |\n| COVID-19 mAbs: licence fees       | 180       | -         | -         |\n| Farxiga : sales milestones        | 29        | -         | -         |\n| tralokinumab: sales milestones    | 20        | 110       | -         |\n| Beyfortus : regulatory milestones | 71        | 25        | -         |\n| Beyfortus : sales milestones      | 27        | -         | -         |\n| Nexium : sale of rights           | -         | 62        | 75        |\n| Other Collaboration Revenue       | 22        | 46        | 13        |\n|                                   | 594       | 598       | 488       |\n\n## 2 Operating profit\n\nOperating profit includes the following significant items:\n\n## Cost of sales\n\nIn 2023, Cost of sales includes a charge of $114m (2022: charge of $3,484m) in relation to the release, in line with sales, of fair value uplift to inventory that was recognised under IFRS 3 'Business Combinations' upon the acquisition of Alexion (see Note 27).\n\nDuring the year, $nil government grants were recognised within Cost of sales (2022: $nil; 2021: $290m). The grants recognised in 2021 related to funding of manufactured Vaxzevria product for the US government, which expired prior to being accepted by the FDA.\n\n## Selling, general and administrative expense\n\nIn 2023, Selling, general and administrative expense includes a charge of $520m (2022: charge of $182m; 2021: charge of $42m) resulting from changes in the fair value of contingent consideration arising from the acquisition of the diabetes alliance from BMS. These adjustments reflect revised estimates for future sales performance for the products acquired and, as a result, revised estimates for future royalties payable.\n\nIn 2023, Selling, general and administrative expense also includes a charge of $1,013m (2022: charge of $789m; 2021: charge of $48m) relating to a number of legal proceedings, including settlements in various jurisdictions in relation to several marketed products (see Note 30).\n\n## Research and development expense: Government grants\n\nDuring the year $74m (2022: $113m; 2021: $531m) of government grants were recognised within Research and development expense. The grants recognised relate to funding for Research and development and related expenses for COVID-19 mAbs of $nil (2022: $112m; 2021: $222m) and Vaxzevria of $74m (2022: $1m; 2021: $309m).",

AstraZeneca received cash proceeds and profit of $776m upon closing, with the profit recorded as Other operating income.\n\nAs part of the total consideration received in respect of the agreement to sell US rights to Synagis in 2019, $400m in total has been received related to the rights to participate in the future cash flows from the US profits or losses for Beyfortus (nirsevimab), with $190m cash inflows in 2023 primarily relating to a cash receipt from Sobi following achievement of a regulatory milestone. At 31 December 2022, the full amount of $522m was recognised as a financial liability within non-current Other payables (the Profit Participation Liability) as the Group had not fully transferred the risks and rewards of the underlying cash flows arising from Beyfortus to Sobi. All associated cash flows have been presented within investing activities as the Group has received the cash in exchange for agreeing to transfer future cash flows relating to an intangible asset. In 2023, the contractual relationship between AstraZeneca and Sobi relating to future sales of Beyfortus in the US was replaced by a royalty relationship between Sanofi and Sobi. As a result, the Profit Participation Liability was extinguished and derecognised from the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position, with a gain of $712m recorded in Other operating income and expense. In 2021, as a result of the Probability of Technical/Regulatory Success unwind, an increase of $114m to the Profit Participation Liability was recorded with the cost recorded in Other operating expense.\n\n## Restructuring costs\n\nDuring 2023, the Group has incurred $467m of net restructuring costs, of which $362m resulted from activities that are part of the Post Alexion Acquisition Group Review (PAAGR), bringing the cumulative charges under this programme to $2,067m. Costs in 2023 included $109m within Cost of sales due to the rationalisation of our manufacturing capacity and footprint across certain production sites, $207m within Selling, general and administrative expense in relation to HR, Finance, IT & other integration costs as well as some severance costs, $212m within Research and development expense in relation to the transformation of clinical, regulatory and other R&D data and systems, partially offset by income of $61m in Other operating income and expense generated from the disposal of assets impacted by the restructuring.\n\nIn conjunction with the acquisition of Alexion in 2021, the enlarged Group initiated the PAAGR; a global restructuring programme aimed at integrating systems, structure and processes, optimising the global footprint and prioritising resource allocations and investments. During 2023, the Group has identified all remaining activities and finalised the scope of the programme. This includes the commencement of work on the planned upgrade of the Group's Enterprise Resource Planning IT systems (Axial Project), which is expected to be substantially complete by the end of 2030. The Group has also continued to progress other legacy restructuring programmes.\n\nTotal restructuring costs in 2023 includes an impairment charge to Property, plant and equipment of $7m (2022: reversal of $4m; 2021: charge of $343m), impairment of Right-of-use assets of $13m (2022: $nil; 2021: $nil) and no impairment of Intangible assets (software development costs) (2022: reversal $17m; 2021: charge of $16m).\n\nThe tables below show the costs that have been charged in respect of restructuring programmes by cost category and type. Severance provisions are detailed in Note 21.\n\n|                                             | 2023 $m   | 2022 $m   | 2021 $m   |\n|---------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| Cost of sales                               | 109       | 266       | 722       |\n| Distribution expense                        | -         | 2         | -         |\n| Research and development expense            | 212       | 111       | 223       |\n| Selling, general and administrative expense | 207       | 405       | 338       |\n| Other operating income and expense          | (61)      | (67)      | -         |\n| Total charge                                | 467       | 717       | 1,283     |",

This intragroup purchase resulted in additional amortisable tax basis in the UK which can be fully utilised against forecast UK taxable profits. Deferred tax has been recognised on this additional tax basis in the year. This is offset by updates to tax liabilities following progress of reviews by tax authorities and administrative appeal processes and derecognition of deferred tax assets following changes to forecast taxable income of specific subsidiaries.\n\nThe income tax paid for the year was $2,366m.\n\nTaxation has been provided at current rates on the profits earned for the years covered by the Group Financial Statements. The 2023 prior year current tax adjustment relates mainly to tax accrual to tax return adjustments and updates to provisions for tax contingencies. The 2022 prior year current tax adjustment relates mainly to tax accrual to tax return adjustments and updates to provisions for tax contingencies. The 2021 prior year current tax adjustment relates mainly to tax accrual to tax return adjustments.\n\nThe 2023 prior year deferred tax adjustment relates mainly to tax accrual to tax return adjustments and adjustments to the recognition of deferred tax assets. The 2022 prior year deferred tax adjustments relate mainly to tax accrual to tax return adjustments and updates to provisions for tax contingencies. The 2021 prior year deferred tax adjustments relate mainly to tax accrual to tax return adjustments and updates to estimates of prior year tax liabilities following settlements with tax authorities.\n\nTo the extent that dividends remitted from overseas subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates are expected to result in additional taxes, appropriate amounts have been provided for. Unremitted earnings or differences in the carrying value and tax basis of investments may be liable to additional taxes if distributed as dividends or on a liquidation event. Deferred tax is provided for such differences in relation to Group entities where management is intending to remit earnings in the foreseeable future. The aggregate amount of gross temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, partnerships and branches for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised totalled approximately $7,565m at 31 December 2023, $3,221m of which has a corresponding deductible temporary difference of the same gross value which is not recognised as it is not probable of reversing in the foreseeable future but on which different tax rates apply.",

        "page_content": "## Factors affecting future tax charges\n\nAs a group with worldwide operations, AstraZeneca is subject to several factors that may affect future tax charges, principally the levels and mix of profitability in different jurisdictions, transfer pricing regulations, tax rates imposed and tax regime reforms. On 11 July 2023, Finance (No.2) Act 2023 was enacted in the UK, introducing a global minimum effective tax rate of 15%. The legislation implements a domestic top-up tax and a multinational top-up tax, effective for accounting periods starting on or after 31 December 2023. A Pillar 2 Effective Tax Rate (ETR) is calculated for every jurisdiction in which the Group operates and Pillar 2 Income Taxes will arise when the Pillar 2 ETR is less than 15%. Pillar 2 Income Taxes could be payable in the UK, or the local jurisdiction if it has introduced a Qualifying Domestic Minimum top-up Tax. AstraZeneca is continuing to monitor potential impacts as further guidance is published by the OECD and territories implement legislation to enact the rules. Management has performed an assessment of the impact of the UK's Pillar 2 rules based on our 2023 data and no Pillar 2 Income Taxes are expected to arise for most jurisdictions in which the Group operates. It is anticipated that AstraZeneca may, in some jurisdictions, incur additional tax liabilities, but the effect on the reported tax charge is reasonably estimated to be immaterial.\n\nThe Group has applied the exemption under the IAS 12 'Income Taxes' amendment for recognising and disclosing information about deferred tax assets and liabilities related to top-up income taxes.\n\n## Tax reconciliation to UK statutory rate\n\nThe table below reconciles the UK statutory tax charge to the Group's total tax charge/(credit):\n\n|                                                                                     | 2023 $m   | 2022 $m   | 2021 $m   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| Profit/(loss) before tax                                                            | 6,899     | 2,501     | (265)     |\n| Notional taxation charge at UK corporation tax rate of 23.5% (2022: 19%; 2021: 19%) | 1,621     | 475       | (50)      |\n| Differences in effective overseas tax rates 1                                       | (224)     | (59)      | 1         |\n| Deferred tax (credit)/charge relating to change in tax rates 2                      | (66)      | (108)     | 54        |\n| Unrecognised deferred tax asset 3                                                   | 341       | 68        | 32        |\n| Items not deductible for tax purposes                                               | 46        | 90        | 208       |\n| Items not chargeable for tax purposes                                               | -         | -         | (163)     |\n| Intellectual Property incentive regimes 4                                           | (367)     | (265)     | -         |\n| Other items 5                                                                       | (406)     | (941)     | (299)     |\n| Adjustments in respect of prior years 6                                             | (7)       | (52)      | (163)     |\n| Total tax charge/(credit) for the year                                              | 938       | (792)     | (380)     |\n\n- 1 Includes the impact of the reversal of a $1.9bn deferred tax liability that was recognised in a previous business combination (31 December 2023: $0.9bn) and originated in goodwill. Some of this liability reverses in an innovation incentive regime and gives rise to a post-acquisition benefit to the tax charge that is not material year-on-year. Determining the cumulative post-acquisition benefit over the life of the asset involves estimates and judgements as the amount of income that qualifies for the IP incentive regime varies. The actual tax rates applied over the life of the asset are expected to be a blend between the Dutch statutory tax rate and intellectual property incentive regime rate.\n- 2 The 2023 item relates to the impact of the difference in the UK current and deferred tax rates during 2023. The 2022 item relates to the impact of the US state tax rate change and the impact of the difference in the UK current tax and deferred tax rates during 2022. The 2021 item mainly relates to substantive enactment of the increase in UK Corporation Tax rate from 19% to 25% effective 1 April 2023 and the increase in the Dutch Corporate Income Tax rate from 25% to 25.8% effective 1 January 2022.\n- 3 This includes the derecognition of deferred tax assets where it is no longer probable that there will be sufficient forecast future profits to utilise the assets.\n- 4 Previously reported within the line Items not deductible for tax purposes.\n- 5 Other items in 2023 include a favourable adjustment of $828m to deferred taxes arising from a UK company undertaking an intragroup purchase of certain intellectual property (see page 164 for more information) offset by a charge of $422m mainly relating to updates to tax liabilities following progress of reviews by tax authorities, administrative appeal processes and adjustments arising on expiry of the relevant statute of limitations (see Note 30 for more details). Other items in 2022 includes a one-time favourable net adjustment of $876m to deferred taxes arising from an internal reorganisation to integrate the Alexion organisation which took place in 2022 and a credit of $65m relating to the reduction of tax liabilities arising from adjustments on expiry of the relevant statute of limitations. Other items in 2021 relate to a net credit of $299m relating to the reduction of tax liabilities arising from updates to estimates of prior year tax liabilities following settlements with tax authorities and on expiry of the relevant statute of limitations partially offset by a provision for transfer pricing and other contingencies.\n- 6 Further details explaining the adjustments in respect of prior years are set out on page 164.\n\nAstraZeneca is domiciled in the UK but operates in other countries where the tax rates and laws are different to those in the UK. The impact on differences in effective overseas tax rates on the Group's overall tax charge is noted above. Profits arising from our manufacturing operation in Puerto Rico are granted special status and are taxed at a reduced rate compared with the normal rate of tax in that territory under a tax incentive grant continuing until 2031. The Group receives intellectual property incentives in certain jurisdictions, resulting in a reduction to the tax charge in the income statement of $367m in 2023.",

Accrued expenses includes the deferred tax on the purchase accounting of inventory.\n- 4 The Income statement movement in 2023 includes $828m arising from a UK company undertaking an intragroup purchase of certain intellectual property (see page 164 for further details). The Income statement movement in 2022 includes the aforementioned net adjustment to deferred taxes of $876m arising on the internal legal entity reorganisation to integrate the Alexion organisation, the majority of which arises on Intangibles, Property, plant and equipment.\n- 5 The Group recognises deferred tax assets to the extent that there are either taxable temporary differences or that it is probable that sufficient future taxable profits will arise, against which these deductible temporary differences can be utilised. The US includes a net deferred tax asset of $142m and the UK includes a net deferred tax asset of $1,723m as at 31 December 2023 which includes tax losses and other deductible temporary differences. The Group has performed an assessment of recovery of deferred tax assets and for these respective entities, the Group has forecasted future taxable profits and considers that it is probable that sufficient future taxable profits will arise against which these deductible temporary differences can be utilised. In arriving at these forecasts, the Group has reviewed the Group-level budgets and forecasts and the ability of those entities to generate future income from developing and commercialising products, including local tax laws and the scheduling of reversal of deductible temporary differences. Deferred tax assets are recognised on the basis there is sufficient forecast future taxable profits arising from the performance of on-market products and pipeline assets, including Imfinzi . For the UK, losses are forecast to be utilised within five years. For the US, recognised deferred taxes on losses and other items are forecast to be utilised within 15 years. It is considered that these sources of income are sufficiently predictable or diversified to support these recognition periods. A sensitivity assessment has been performed which shows that a change in profit of 10% results in an immaterial adjustment to the amount of deferred tax asset recognised. Assessing the availability of future taxable income to support recognition of deferred tax assets relies upon our Group forecasts and changes in these Group forecasts will impact the recoverability of deferred tax assets. To the extent that there are neither taxable temporary differences nor sufficient taxable profits, no deferred tax asset is recognised and details of unrecognised deferred tax assets are included in the table below.\n\nThe net deferred tax balance, before the offset of balances within countries, consists of:\n\n|                                              | Intangibles, Property, plant and equipment $m   | Pension and post-retirement benefits $m   | Elimination of unrealised profit on inventory $m   | Untaxed reserves $m   | Losses and tax credits carried forward $m   | Accrued expenses $m   | Other $m   | Total $m   |\n|----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------|-----------------------|------------|------------|\n| Deferred tax assets at 31 December 2021      | 1,476                                           | 574                                       | 1,910                                              | -                     | 1,571                                       | 1,117                 | 618        | 7, 26 6    |\n| Deferred tax liabilities at 31 December 2021 | (6,956)                                         | (21)                                      | (49)                                               | (862)                 | (53)                                        | (1,032)               | (169)      | ( 9,142)   |\n| Net deferred tax balance at 31 December 2021 | (5,480)                                         | 553                                       | 1,861                                              | (862)                 | 1,518                                       | 85                    | 449        | (1,876)    |\n| Deferred tax assets at 31 December 2022      | 1,499                                           | 276                                       | 2,048                                              | -                     | 1,274                                       | 1,005                 | 609        | 6,711      |\n| Deferred tax liabilities at 31 December 2022 | (5,430)                                         | (45)                                      | (24)                                               | (716)                 | (16)                                        | (125)                 | (36)       | (6,392)    |\n| Net deferred tax balance at 31 December 2022 | (3,931)                                         | 231                                       | 2,024                                              | (716)                 | 1,258                                       | 880                   | 573        | 319        |\n| Deferred tax assets at 31 December 2023      | 1,883                                           | 313                                       | 2,386                                              | -                     | 1,141                                       | 1,011                 | 488        | 7,222      |\n| Deferred tax liabilities at 31 December 2023 | (4,374)                                         | (30)                                      | -                                                  | (660)                 | (35)                                        | (122)                 | (127)      | (5,348)    |\n| Net deferred tax balance at 31 December 2023 | (2,491)                                         | 283                                       | 2,386                                              | (660)                 | 1,106                                       | 889                   | 361        | 1,874      |\n\nAnalysed in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position, after offset of balances within countries, as follows:\n\n|                          | 2023 $m   | 2022 $m   | 2021 $m   |\n|--------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| Deferred tax assets      | 4,718     | 3,263     | 4,330     |\n| Deferred tax liabilities | (2,844)   | (2,944)   | (6,206)   |\n| Net deferred tax balance | 1,874     | 319       | (1,876)   |",

AstraZeneca's pharmaceuticals business consists of the discovery and development of new products, which are then manufactured, marketed and sold. All of these functional activities take place (and are managed) globally on a highly integrated basis. These individual functional areas are not managed separately.\n\n## 2 The identification of the Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM) and the nature and extent of the financial information reviewed by the CODM:\n\nThe SET, established and chaired by the CEO, is the vehicle through which the CEO exercises the authority delegated to him from the Board for the management, development and performance of AstraZeneca as a whole. It is considered that the SET is AstraZeneca's Chief Operating Decision Making body (as defined by IFRS 8). The operation of the SET is principally driven by the management of the Commercial operations, R&D, manufacturing and supply and enabling functions. All significant operating decisions are undertaken by the SET. While members of the SET have responsibility for implementation of decisions in their respective areas, operating decision making is at SET level as a whole. Where necessary, these are implemented through cross-functional sub-committees that consider the Group-wide impact of a new decision. For example, product launch decisions would be initially considered by the SET and, on approval, passed to an appropriate sub team for implementation. The ability of the enterprise to develop, produce, deliver and commercialise a wide range of pharmaceutical products are central to the SET decisionmaking process.\n\nIn assessing performance, the SET reviews financial information on an integrated basis for the Group as a whole, substantially in the form of, and on the same basis as, the Group's IFRS Financial Statements. The high upfront cost of discovering and developing new products, coupled with the relatively insignificant and stable unit cost of production, means that there is not the clear link that exists in many manufacturing businesses between the revenue generated on an individual product sale and the associated cost and hence margin generated on a product. Consequently, the profitability of individual drugs or classes of drugs is not considered a key measure of performance for the business and is not monitored by the SET. The focus of additional financial information reviewed is at brand sales and Gross Margin level within specific geographies. Expenditure analysis is completed for the science units, operations and enabling functions; there is no allocation of these centrally managed Group costs to the individual product or brands. The bonus of SET members' continues to be derived from the Group scorecard outcome as discussed in our Directors' Remuneration Report.\n\n## 3 How resources are allocated:\n\nResources are allocated on a Group-wide basis according to need. In particular, capital expenditure, in-licensing, and R&D resources are allocated between activities on merit, based on overall therapeutic considerations and strategy under the aegis of the Group's Early-Stage Product Committees and Late-Stage Product Committees.",

Intangible assets under development and not available for use are tested annually for impairment and other intangible assets are tested when there is an indication of impairment loss or reversal. Where testing is required, the recoverable amount of the assets is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss or reversal. Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the Cash Generating Unit (CGU) to which it belongs. The Group considers that as the intangible assets are linked to individual products and that product cash flows are considered to be largely independent of other product cash flows, the CGU for intangibles is at the product level. Group-level budgets and forecasts include forecast capital investment and operational impacts related to sustainability projects, as well as inflationary impacts, and form the basis for the value in use models used for impairment testing.\n\nAn asset's recoverable amount is determined as the higher of an asset's or CGU's fair value less costs to sell or value in use, in both cases using discounted cash flow calculations where the asset's expected post-tax cash flows are risk-adjusted over their estimated remaining period of expected economic benefit. Where the value in use approach is used, the post-tax risk-adjusted cash flows are discounted using AstraZeneca's post-tax weighted average cost of capital (7.5% for 2023, 7% for 2022 and 2021) which is a nominal rate. There is no material difference in the approach taken to using pre-tax cash flows and a pre-tax rate compared to post-tax cash flows and a post-tax rate, as required by IAS 36. Where fair value less costs to sell is used to determine recoverable value, the discount rate is assessed with reference to a market participant; this is not usually materially different to the AstraZeneca post-tax weighted average cost of capital of 7.5%. Intangible assets have been tested for impairment under the value in use basis at risk-adjusted post-tax discount rates ranging between 7.5% to 9.5%.",

Impairment charges recorded against products in development totalled $417m, including $244m related to ALXN1840 which was fully impaired following the decision to discontinue development.\n\nIn 2022, the Group recorded impairment charges of $146m in respect of launched products. Impairment charges recorded against products in development totalled $172m due to decisions made to terminate the related activities.\n\nIn 2021, the Group recorded impairment charges of $603m in respect of launched products, including Bydureon ($469m, revised carrying amount of $50m) under value in use model, roxadustat ($121m, revised carrying amount of $215m) under value in use model and other launched products totalling $13m.\n\nImpairment charges recorded against products in development in 2021, based on fair value less costs to sell, totalled $1,464m, principally Ardea ($1,172m) which was fully impaired following the decision to discontinue development of verinurad. The remaining impairments relate to full impairments of various products in development, due to either management's decision to discontinue development as part of a Group-wide portfolio prioritisation review, or due to the outcome of research activities.\n\nThe Group has performed an assessment on assets which have had impairments recorded in previous periods to determine if any reversals of impairments were required. No impairment reversals were recorded in 2023. Impairment reversals of $94m were recorded in 2022, including $77m in respect of products in development. No impairment reversals were recorded in 2021.\n\nWhen launched products are partially impaired, the carrying values of these assets in future periods are particularly sensitive to changes in forecast assumptions, including those assumptions set out above, as the asset is impaired down to its recoverable amount.\n\n## Significant assets\n\n|                                                                                                | Carrying value $m   | Remaining amortisation period   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------------------|\n| C5 franchise ( Soliris / Ultomiris ) intangible assets arising from the acquisition of Alexion | 14,356              | 4 to 12 years                   |\n| Intangible assets arising from the acquisition of Acerta Pharma                                | 4,335               | 9 years                         |\n| Strensiq ,  Kanuma ,  Andexxa  intangible assets arising from the acquisition of Alexion       | 4,147               | 9 to 15 years                   |\n| Enhertu  intangible assets acquired from Daiichi Sankyo                                        | 2,831               | 10 years                        |\n| Intangible asset products in development arising from the acquisition of Alexion 1             | 2,489               | Not amortised                   |\n| Intangible assets arising from the acquisition of ZS Pharma Inc.                               | 1,838               | 8 years                         |\n| Other intangible assets acquired from Daiichi Sankyo 1                                         | 989                 | Not amortised                   |\n| Baxdrostat intangible asset acquired from CinCor Pharma, Inc. 1                                | 780                 | Not amortised                   |\n| Airsupra  intangible asset                                                                     | 524                 | 11 years                        |\n| Intangible assets arising from the restructuring of a historical joint venture with MSD        | 472                 | 3 to 6 years                    |\n| Farxiga / Forxiga  intangible assets acquired from BMS                                         | 426                 | 3 years                         |\n| Intangible assets arising from the acquisition of Pearl Therapeutics, Inc                      | 412                 | 5 to 6 years                    |\n| Monalizumab intangible assets acquired from Innate Pharma 1                                    | 370                 | Not amortised                   |\n| RSV franchise assets arising from the acquisition of MedImmune                                 | 305                 | 2 years                         |\n| Rare disease portfolio assets acquired from Pfizer 1                                           | 300                 | Not amortised                   |\n\nThe intangible asset baxdrostat recognised on acquisition of CinCor Pharma, Inc. in 2023 was assessed under the optional concentration test in IFRS 3 and was determined to be an asset acquisition, as substantially all of the value of the gross assets acquired was concentrated in this single asset.\n\nThe acquisition of Pfizer's pre-clinical rare disease gene therapy portfolio in 2023 was assessed under IFRS 3 and the transaction was treated as an asset acquisition.",

Since its establishment, AstraZeneca has contributed $80m in cash to the joint venture entity and has a 27% interest in the joint venture.\n\nOn 1 December 2015, AstraZeneca entered into a joint venture agreement with Fujifilm Kyowa Kirin Biologics Co., Ltd. to develop a biosimilar using the combined capabilities of the two parties. The agreement resulted in the formation of a joint venture entity based in the UK, Centus Biotherapeutics Limited (Centus). Since its establishment, AstraZeneca has contributed $135m in cash to the joint venture entity and has a 50% interest in the joint venture. On 26 April 2023, Centus entered a voluntary liquidation process.\n\nAll investments are accounted for using the equity method. At 31 December 2023, unrecognised losses in associates and joint ventures totalled $140m (2022: $92m; 2021: $73m) which have not been recognised due to the investment carrying value reaching $nil value.\n\nAggregated summarised financial information for the associate and joint venture entities is set out below:\n\n|                                                                | 2023 $m   | 2022 $m   | 2021 $m   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| Non-current assets                                             | 424       | 290       | 215       |\n| Current assets                                                 | 362       | 300       | 506       |\n| Total liabilities                                              | (287)     | (72)      | (99)      |\n| Net assets                                                     | 499       | 518       | 622       |\n| Amount attributable to AstraZeneca                             | 85        | 91        | 65        |\n| Goodwill                                                       | 52        | -         | -         |\n| Exchange adjustments                                           | 10        | (15)      | 4         |\n| Carrying value of investments in associates and joint ventures | 147       | 76        | 69        |\n\nJoint contractual arrangements were entered into between AstraZeneca and Daiichi Sankyo Company Limited (Daiichi Sankyo); in March 2019 for the co-development and co-commercialisation of Enhertu and in July 2020 for the co-development and co-commercialisation of Dato-DXd. Each party shares global pre-tax net income from the collaboration on a 50:50 basis (with the exception of Japan where Daiichi Sankyo maintains exclusive rights and AstraZeneca receives a royalty). The joint operation is not structured through a separate legal entity, and it operates from AstraZeneca and Daiichi Sankyo's respective principal places of business.",

Other investments held at FVPL mainly comprise fixed income securities that the Group holds to sell.\n\nThe fair value of listed investments is based on year end quoted market prices. Fixed deposits and Cash collateral pledged to counterparties are held at amortised cost with carrying value being a reasonable approximation of fair value given their short-term nature.\n\nCash collateral pledged to counterparties relates to collateral pledged on derivatives entered into to hedge the Group's risk exposures. In 2022, following significant foreign currency volatility increasing the collateral requirements, the Group revised its presentation to 'Other investments'. In 2021 amounts of $47m are presented within Cash and cash equivalents.\n\n## Fair value hierarchy\n\nThe table below analyses equity securities and bonds, contained within Other investments and carried at fair value, by valuation method. The different levels have been defined as follows:\n\n- >  Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities\n- >  Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices)\n- >  Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).\n\n|         | 2023 FVPL $m   | 2023 FVOCI $m   | 2022 FVPL $m   | 2022 FVOCI $m   | 2021 FVPL $m   | 2021 FVOCI $m   |\n|---------|----------------|-----------------|----------------|-----------------|----------------|-----------------|\n| Level 1 | 20             | 1,217           | 13             | 880             | 16             | 1,064           |\n| Level 2 | -              | -               | -              | -               | -              | -               |\n| Level 3 | -              | 313             | 10             | 176             | -              | 104             |\n| Total   | 20             | 1,530           | 23             | 1,056           | 16             | 1,168           |\n\nAssets are transferred in or out of each Level on the date of the event or change in circumstances that caused the transfer.\n\nEquity securities that are analysed at Level 3 include investments in private biotech companies. In the absence of specific market data, these unlisted investments are held at fair value based on the cost of investment and adjusting as necessary for impairments and revaluations on new funding rounds, which approximates to fair value.

The carrying value of loans designated at FVPL is the fair value; this falls within the Level 1 valuation method as defined in Note 12. For loans designated in a fair value hedge relationship, carrying value is initially measured at fair value and remeasured for fair value changes in respect of the hedged risk at each reporting date. All other loans are held at amortised cost. Fair values, as disclosed in the table above, are all determined using the Level 1 valuation method as defined in Note 12, with the exception of overdrafts and lease liabilities, where fair value approximates to carrying values.",

If the option is taken, the Group's liability is assigned by the supplier to be due to the relationship bank rather than the supplier. The value of the liability payable by the Group remains unchanged. The Group assesses the arrangement against indicators to assess if debts which vendors have sold to the funder under the supplier financing scheme continue to meet the definition of trade payables or should be classified as borrowings. At 31 December 2023, the payables met the criteria of Trade payables. The supply chain financing programme operates in the US, UK, Sweden, China and Germany, and as at 31 December 2023, the programme had 461 suppliers enrolled across these countries.\n\nVaccine contract liabilities relate to amounts received from customers, primarily government bodies, in advance of supply of product.\n\nDeferred government grant income relates to government grants received or receivable but for which the related expenses have not been incurred.\n\nIncluded within current Other payables are liabilities to Daiichi Sankyo totalling $199m (2022: $100m; 2021: $nil) resulting from the collaboration agreement in relation to Enhertu entered into in March 2019 and $nil (2022: $nil; 2021: $324m) in relation to Dato-DXd entered into in July 2020. Additionally, included within non-current Other payables are liabilities totalling $774m (2022: $1,125m; 2021: $100m) as a result of the Enhertu collaboration agreement and $464m (2022: $nil; 2021: $nil) as a result of the Airsupra collaboration agreement.\n\nIn November 2020, Calquence received marketing approval in the EU, which removed all remaining conditionality in respect of the Acerta Pharma put and call options regarding the non-controlling interest; the option was exercised in April 2021 (see Note 26). The payments will be made in similar annual instalments in 2022 through to 2024, with the first payment of $920m made in 2022 and the second payment of $867m made in 2023, with a closing liability as at 31 December 2023 of $833m (2022: $1,646m; 2021: $2,458m). Interest arising from amortising the liability is included within Finance expense (see Note 3). The associated cash flows are disclosed as financing activities within the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.\n\nWith the exception of Contingent consideration payables of $2,137m (2022: $2,222m; 2021: $2,865m) which are held at fair value within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy as defined in Note 12, all other financial liabilities are held at amortised cost with carrying value being a reasonable approximation of fair value.",

Discount unwind on the liability is included within Finance expense (see Note 3).\n\nThe discount rate used for the Contingent consideration balances range from 5% to 8%.

Once established, these amounts remain in Provisions even after settlement is reached and uncertainty resolved, with no transfer to Trade and other payables prior to payment. This is to provide more transparent disclosure of subsequent movements in brought forward and carried forward balances. Settled legal claims included within provisions are held at amortised cost with carrying value being a reasonable approximation of fair value.\n\nSeverance provisions arise predominantly in connection with global restructuring initiatives, including the PAAGR, which involve rationalisation of the global supply chain, the sales and marketing organisation, IT and business support infrastructure, and R&D.\n\nIn conjunction with the acquisition of Alexion in 2021, the enlarged Group initiated the PAAGR; a global restructuring programme, aimed at integrating systems, structure and processes, optimising the global footprint and prioritising resource allocations and investments. This includes the commencement of work on the planned upgrade of the Group's Enterprise Resource Planning IT systems (Axial Project). The Group has also continued to progress other legacy restructuring programmes.\n\nEmployee costs in connection with the initiatives are recognised in severance provisions when a detailed formal plan has been communicated to those employees affected. Final severance costs are often subject to the completion of the requisite consultations on the areas impacted, with the majority of the cost expected to be paid within one year. AstraZeneca endeavours to support employees affected by restructuring initiatives to seek alternative roles within the organisation. Where the employee is successful, any severance provisions will be released.\n\nDetails of the Environmental provisions totalling $112m (2022: $131m; 2021: $90m) and ongoing matters are provided in Note 30. These uncertainties can also cause reversal in previously established provisions once final settlement is reached.\n\nLegal issues are often subject to substantial uncertainties with regard to the timing and final amounts of any payments. A significant proportion of the total legal provision, $616m (2022: $30m; 2021: $15m) due within one year and $372m (2022: $92m; 2021: $105m) due after more than one year 1 , relates to matters settled, but not paid, in previous periods, further details are provided in Note 30.\n\nThe majority of Employee benefit provisions relate to Executive Deferred Compensation Plans, which include uncertainty over the ultimate timing and amount of payment to be made to the executives.\n\nOther provisions comprise amounts relating to specific contractual or constructive obligations and disputes. Included within Other provisions are amounts associated with long-standing product liability settlements that arose prior to the merger of Astra and Zeneca, which given the nature of the provision, the amounts are expected to be settled over many years; the final settlement values and timings are uncertain. Also included in Other provisions is an amount of $163m (2022: $165m; 2021: $185m), in relation to third-party liability and other risks (including incurred but not yet reported claims); the claims are considered to be uncertain as to timing and amount. Charges to Other provisions in 2023 included $87m (2022: $12m; 2021: $243m) in relation to the PAAGR restructuring programme, which has a closing provision of $49m (2022: $143m; 2021: $243m), including $8m (2022: $95m; 2021: $158m) held in non-current provisions expected to be settled over time by 2025. In 2022, charges to Other provisions included $301m in relation to termination fees and onerous contracts with contract manufacturing organisations, the vast majority of which was settled in 2023.\n\nNo provision has been released or applied for any purpose other than that for which it was established.\n\n## 22 Post-retirement pension and other defined benefit schemes Background\n\nThis section predominantly covers defined benefit arrangements like post-retirement pension and medical plans which make up the vast bulk of the Group's liabilities. However, it also incorporates other benefits which fall under IAS 19 rules and which require an actuarial valuation, including but not limited to: lump sum plans, long service awards and defined contribution pension plans which have some defined benefit characteristics (e.g. a minimum guaranteed level of benefit). In total, over 50 plans in 28 countries are covered.\n\nThe Group and most of its subsidiaries offer retirement plans which cover the majority of employees. The Group's policy is to provide defined contribution (DC) orientated pension provision to its employees unless otherwise compelled by local regulation. As a result, many of these retirement plans are DC, where the Group contribution and resulting charge is fixed at a set level or is a set percentage of employees' pay. However, several plans, mainly in the UK and Sweden, are defined benefit (DB), where benefits are based on employees' length of service and salary. The major DB plans are largely legacy arrangements as they have been closed to new entrants since 2000, apart from the collectively bargained Swedish plan (which is still open to employees born before 1979). During 2010, following consultation with its UK employees' representatives, the Group introduced a freeze on pensionable pay at 30 June 2010 levels for DB members of the UK Pension Fund. The number of active members in the Fund continues to decline and is now 400 employees.\n\nThe major DB plans are funded through separate, fiduciary-administered assets. The cash funding of the plans, which may from time to time involve payments from the Group, is designed, in consultation with independent qualified actuaries, to ensure that the assets are sufficient to meet future obligations as and when they fall due. The funding level is monitored by the Group and local fiduciaries, who take into account the strength of the Group's covenant, local regulation, cash flows, and the solvency and maturity of the pension plan.",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the Group Financial Statements\n\n## continued\n\n## 22 Post-retirement and other defined benefit schemes continued\n\n## Financing Principles and Funding Framework\n\nEighty six per cent of the Group's total DB obligations (or 66% of net obligations) at 31 December 2023 are in schemes within the UK and Sweden. In these countries, the pension obligations are funded in line with the Group's financing principles, as disclosed in prior years.\n\nThe Group has developed a long-term funding framework to implement these principles. This framework targets either full funding on a low-risk funding measure, or buyout with an external insurer as the pension funds mature, with affordable long-term de-risking of investment strategy along the way. Unless local regulation dictates otherwise, this framework determines the cash contributions payable.\n\n## UK\n\nThe UK Pension Fund represents approximately 65% of the Group's DB obligations at 31 December 2023. The financing principles are modified in light of the UK regulatory requirements (summarised below) and resulting discussions with the Trustee.\n\n## Role of Trustee and Regulation\n\nThe UK Pension Fund is governed and administered by a corporate Trustee which is legally separate from the Group. The Trustee Directors are comprised of representatives appointed by both the employer and employees and include an independent professional Trustee Director. The Trustee Directors are required by law to act in the interest of all relevant beneficiaries and are responsible in particular for investment strategy and the day-to-day administration of the benefits. They are also responsible for jointly agreeing with the employer the level of contributions due to the UK Pension Fund.\n\nThe UK pensions industry is regulated by The Pensions Regulator whose statutory objectives and regulatory powers are described on its website, www.thepensionsregulator.gov.uk.\n\nThe Pension Scheme Act 2021 became effective in the UK from 1 October 2021. A section of this Act places additional legal requirements on companies who sponsor UK defined benefit pension schemes, to monitor and assess corporate activity, with a focus on the potential impact of such activity on the ongoing security of these benefits. The Group maintains a framework to ensure it meets its responsibilities under the Act.\n\nThere have been two UK High Court Rulings relating to Guaranteed Minimum Pensions (GMP) equalisation in 2018 and 2020. Following the publication of guidance around implementation in 2021, the Trustee, with input from the Group, has now completed the equalisation of benefits for the vast majority of pensioner members, with the project expected to complete in 2024. Further details are set out later in this Note. An estimate of the impact of these changes has already been recognised in 2018 and 2020, and actual experience is in line with the estimates previously recognised.\n\nIn June 2023, the UK High Court (Virgin Media Limited v NTL Pension Trustees II Limited) ruled that certain historical amendments for contractedout defined benefit schemes were invalid if they were not accompanied by the correct actuarial confirmation. The judgment is subject to appeal. The Trustee and Group are monitoring developments and will consider if there are any implications for the UK Pension Fund, if the ruling is upheld.\n\n## Funding requirements\n\nUK legislation requires that an actuarial valuation is completed for all DB pension schemes every three years, which compares the schemes' liabilities to its assets. As part of the triennial valuation process, the Trustee and the Group must agree on a set of assumptions to value the liabilities and determine the contributions required, if any, to ensure the UK Pension Fund is fully funded over an appropriate time period and on a suitably prudent measure. The assumptions used to value the liabilities for the triennial actuarial valuation are required to be prudent, whereas the assumptions used to prepare an IAS 19 accounting valuation are required to be 'best estimate'.\n\nThe last full actuarial valuation of the UK Pension Fund was carried out by a qualified actuary as at 31 March 2022 and finalised in May 2023, ahead of the statutory deadline.\n\nUnder the funding assumptions used to set the statutory funding target, the key assumptions from the actuarial valuation as at 31 March 2022 (shown as a single-equivalent rate) were as follows: salary increases at 0% per annum (as a result of pensionable pay levels being frozen in 2010); pension increases at 3.64% per annum; and discount rate at 3.03% per annum. The resulting valuation of the Fund's liabilities on that basis was \u00a35,951m ($7,820m) compared to a market valuation of assets at 31 March 2022 of \u00a35,604m ($7,364m).\n\nAspects of the triennial actuarial valuation are governed by a long-term funding agreement, effective since October 2016, which sets out a path to full funding on a low-risk measure. Under this agreement, if a deficit exists, the Group is required to provide security. This security takes the form of a charge in favour of the Trustee over all land and buildings on the Group's Cambridge Biomedical Campus site. This charge was enacted in December 2023, and provides long-term security to the Trustee in respect of the Group's future deficit recovery contributions. The value of the charge is currently \u00a3317m ($404m) and it is capped at \u00a3350m ($446m). The value of the charge will vary and is expected to reduce over time, before falling away. Under the terms of the charge, the Trustee can only exercise its right over the ownership of the site in a Group insolvency event.",

        "page_content": "In relation to deficit recovery contributions, a lump sum contribution of \u00a339m ($48m) was made in March 2023, with a further annual contribution of \u00a339m ($50m) due before 31 March 2024, and each year up to March 2028.\n\nFurther progress was made over 2023 in equalising GMP for members of the UK Pension Fund. The method of equalisation converts GMP to nonGMP pension to simplify the structure and administration of benefits. As at 31 December 2023, almost all pensioner and dependent members have had their benefits equalised and, for non-pensioner members, a process will be in place in 2024 to equalise their benefits at their point of retirement. As part of the project, a Pension Increase Exchange ('PiE') option was also made available to the majority of pensioner members, at the Group's discretion. This option provided the member with a choice to opt for a higher pension right away, but with no, or fewer, inflation-linked increases in the future. Take-up of this option resulted in a reduction to expected future liabilities and a $16m past service credit was taken to the income statement in March 2023.\n\nUnder the governing documentation of the UK Pension Fund, any future surplus in the Fund would be returnable to the Group by refund assuming gradual settlement of the liabilities over the lifetime of the Fund. In particular, the Trustee has no unilateral right to wind up the Fund without Company consent nor does it have the power to unilaterally use surplus to augment benefits prior to wind-up. As such, there are no adjustments required in respect of IFRIC 14 'IAS 19 - The Limit on a Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction'.\n\nOn current bases, it is expected that ongoing contributions (excluding those in respect of past service deficit contributions) during the year ending 31 December 2024 for the UK scheme will be approximately $18m.\n\n## United States\n\nIn May 2023, AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals LP agreed a buy-out of its qualified US Defined Benefit Pension Plan with an external insurer. All Plan liabilities (approximately $840m) have now been discharged (via a mix of cash payments to participants and purchase of insured annuities), with an impact of $1.7m on the income statement and a net Group cash contribution of approximately $25m. The Plan is wound up and the Trust is closed. The transaction will be completed in 2024, pending approval of Group annuity contracts from State Regulators.\n\nThere are three remaining immaterial US post-retirement benefit plans and therefore from 2024, these will not be individually disclosed.\n\n## Sweden\n\nThe Swedish plans account for 20% of the Group's defined benefit obligations. They are governed by Fiduciary Bodies with responsibility for the investment of the assets. These plans are funded in line with the Group's financing principles and local regulations.\n\nThe Swedish defined benefit pension plans were actuarially valued at 31 December 2022, when plan obligations were estimated to amount to $1,312m and plan assets were $946m. The local Swedish GAAP funding position can influence contribution policy. Over 2023, for the main pension fund the Group did not request a reimbursement of benefit payments made throughout the year as the funding level was below 100% on the Swedish GAAP basis. The benefit payments over 2023, totalling approximately $47m, are therefore regarded as Group contributions.\n\nOn current bases, it is expected that ongoing contributions (excluding those in respect of past service deficit contributions) during the year ending 31 December 2024 for Sweden will be approximately $53m.\n\n## Other defined benefit plans\n\nThe Group provides benefit plans other than pensions which have to be reported under IAS 19. These include lump sum plans, long service awards and defined contribution pension plans which have a guaranteed minimum benefit. However, the largest category of these 'other' non-pension plans are healthcare benefits.\n\nIn the US, and to a lesser extent in certain other countries, the Group's employment practices include the provision of healthcare and life assurance benefits for eligible retired employees. As at 31 December 2023, some 2,673 retired employees and covered dependents currently benefit from these provisions and some 2,133 current employees will be eligible on their retirement. The Group accrues for the present value of such retiree obligations over the working life of the employee. In practice, these benefits will be funded with reference to the financing principles.\n\nIn the US, the Post Retirement Welfare Plan which provides retiree medical benefits has a surplus of $66m. As a result, the investment strategy has been fully de-risked. The Group has concluded that under current legislation, the surplus would be repayable in the future to subsidise other medical benefits offered to employees.\n\nThe cost of post-retirement benefits other than pensions for the Group in 2023 was $1m (2022: $1m; 2021: $1m). Plan assets were $161m and plan obligations were $114m at 31 December 2023. These benefit plans have been included in the disclosure of post-retirement benefits under IAS 19.",

Approximately 45% of the UK Pension Fund is allocated  to growth assets. Although these growth assets are expected to  outperform AA-rated corporate bonds in the long term, they can lead to  volatility and mismatching risk in the short term. The allocation to growth  assets is monitored to ensure it remains appropriate given the UK Pension  Fund's long-term objectives. | Mitigation In order to mitigate investment risk, the Trustee invests in a suitably  diversified range of asset classes, return drivers and investment managers.  The investment strategy will evolve to further improve the expected risk/return  profile as opportunities arise. De-risking of the investment strategy took  place over 2023, as the Fund moved ahead of its long-term target, with the  benchmark allocation to Growth Assets reducing from 62.5% to 47.5%. The Trustee has hedged approximately 92% of unintended non-sterling,  overseas currency risk within the UK Pension Fund assets.                                |\n| Interest  rate risk           | A decrease in corporate bond yields will increase the present value  placed on the DBO for accounting purposes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | The interest rate hedge of the UK Pension Fund is predominantly implemented  via holding gilts (and gilt repurchase agreements or 'gilt repo') of appropriate  duration.

The swap currently  covers approximately 8,000 of the UK Pension Fund's pensioners, equivalent  to $2.4bn of Pension fund liability. A one-year increase in life expectancy  would result in a $214m increase in pension fund obligations, which would  be partially offset by a $108m increase in the value of the longevity swap  and hence the pension fund assets.                                                                                                                                    |\n| Cash flow and  liquidity risk | The UK Pension Fund is maturing and cash flow negative. Assets  are liquidated to meet benefit outgo and potentially from time to time,  to supplement the collateral pool required to post margin for  derivative holdings.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | The Trustee invests in a diversified portfolio of highly liquid assets to  manage sequencing risk and operates a collateral management policy,  maintaining a minimum liquidity 'buffer' above recommended regulatory  guidelines, which can be quickly supplemented in an orderly manner.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n\n## Other risks\n\nThere are a number of other risks of administering the UK Pension Fund which the Trustee manages with Group input. Some of the major risks include counterparty risks from using derivatives (mitigated by using a specialist investment manager to oversee a diversified range of counterparties of high standing and ensuring positions are collateralised daily). Furthermore, there are operational risks (such as paying out the wrong benefits) and legislative risks (such as the UK government introducing new legislation). These are mitigated so far as possible via the governance structure in place which oversees and administers the pension funds.\n\nThe Group's pension plans in Sweden also manage these key risks, where relevant, in a similar way, with the local fiduciary bodies investing in a diversified manner and employing a framework to hedge interest rate risk where practicable.\n\nLocal fiduciary boards are aware of Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) risks as they pertain to investment policy, and where local regulation allows, have policies in place to monitor and manage such risks and comply with local legislation and disclosure requirements. The Trustee of the UK Pension Fund published its inaugural Task Force for Climate-related Disclosures (TCFD) report in October 2023.",

The effect on retirement benefit obligations of a 1.0% change in assumption is as follows: $525m (UK) and $210m (Sweden) if the discount rate is increased; $(634)m (UK) and $(254)m (Sweden) if the discount rate is decreased; $(384)m (UK) and $(240)m (Sweden) if the inflation rate is increased; and $363m (UK) and $201m (Sweden) if the inflation rate is decreased.\n\nThe sensitivity to the financial assumptions shown above has been estimated taking into account the approximate duration of the liabilities and the overall profile of the plan membership.\n\nThe inflation sensitivity allows for the impact of a change in inflation on salary increases and pension increases (where these assumptions are inflation-linked).\n\nThe salary increase sensitivity reflects the impact of an increase of only salary relative to inflation.\n\nThe sensitivity to the life expectancy assumption is estimated based on a revised mortality assumption that extends/reduces the current life expectancy by one year for a particular age.\n\n## 23 Reserves\n\n## Retained earnings\n\nThe cumulative amount of goodwill written off directly to reserves resulting from acquisitions, net of disposals, amounted to $595m (2022: $591m; 2021: $615m) using year end rates of exchange.\n\nAt 31 December 2023, 1,580,137 shares, at a cost of $129m, have been deducted from Retained earnings (2022: 1,671,446 shares, at a cost of $112m; 2021: 3,922,122 shares, at a cost of $239m) to satisfy future vesting of employee share plans.\n\nThere are no significant statutory or contractual restrictions on the distribution of current profits of subsidiaries; undistributed profits of prior years are, in the main, permanently employed in the businesses of these companies. The undistributed income of AstraZeneca companies overseas might be liable to overseas taxes and/or UK taxation (after allowing for double taxation relief) if they were to be distributed as dividends (see Note 4).\n\n|                                                                                   | 2023 $m   | 2022 $m   | 2021 $m   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| Cumulative translation differences included within Retained earnings At 1 January | (3,694)   | (1,934)   | (1,143)   |\n| Foreign exchange arising on consolidation                                         | 608       | (1,446)   | (483)     |\n| Exchange adjustments on goodwill (recorded against other reserves)                | 4         | (24)      | (21)      |\n| Foreign exchange arising on designated liabilities in net investment hedges 1     | 24        | (282)     | (321)     |\n| Fair value movements on derivatives designated in net investment hedges           | 44        | (8)       | 34        |\n| Net exchange movement in Retained earnings                                        | 680       | (1,760)   | (791)     |\n| At 31 December                                                                    | (3,014)   | (3,694)   | (1,934)   |\n\nThe cumulative loss with respect to costs of hedging is $22m (2022: loss of $3m; 2021: gain of $4m) and the loss during the year was $19m (2022: loss of $7m; 2021: loss of $6m).\n\nThe balance remaining in the foreign currency translation reserve from net investment hedging relationships for which hedge accounting no longer applied is a gain of $527m. For further detail relating to hedging balances, please see the Hedge accounting section within Note 28, from page 200.\n\n## Other reserves\n\nThe other reserves arose from the cancellation of \u00a31,255m of share premium account by the Company in 1993 and the redenomination of share capital of $157m in 1999. The reserves are available for writing off goodwill arising on consolidation and, subject to guarantees given to preserve creditors at the date of the court order, are available for distribution.",

AstraZeneca Indonesia, Beijing Falikang Pharmaceutical (China) Co. Limited, and AstraZeneca Algeria Pharmaceutical Industries SPA.\n\nIn February 2016, AstraZeneca acquired a 55% controlling stake in Acerta Pharma where the non-controlling interest was subject to put and call options. The put option gave rise to a liability (see Note 20). AstraZeneca exercised its option to acquire the remaining 45% of shares in Acerta Pharma in April 2021.\n\nAs part of the acquisition of Alexion in July 2021, a pre-existing non-controlling interest in Caelum Biosciences was recognised (Note 27). This was valued at $150m, the agreed-upon exercise price for the exclusive option to acquire the remaining equity. The option was exercised on 28 September 2021 and the acquisition of Caelum Biosciences closed shortly thereafter on 5 October 2021.\n\n## 27 Acquisition of business operations\n\n## Acquisitions of business operations in 2023\n\nOn 16 January 2023, AstraZeneca completed the acquisition of Neogene Therapeutics Inc. (Neogene), a global clinical-stage biotechnology company pioneering the discovery, development and manufacturing of next-generation T-cell receptor therapies (TCR-Ts). The purchase price allocation exercise has completed, with the fair value of total consideration determined at $267m. Intangible assets of $100m and goodwill of $158m were recognised in the acquisition balance sheet, as well as a cash outflow of $189m net of cash acquired. Future contingent milestones-based and non-contingent consideration is payable to a maximum of $120m. Neogene's results have been consolidated into the Group's results from 16 January 2023.\n\n## Acquisitions of business operations in 2022\n\nOn 16 November 2022, AstraZeneca completed the acquisition of 100% of the issued shares of LogicBio Therapeutics, Inc. (LogicBio) based in Lexington, MA, US. LogicBio is a clinical-stage genetic medicine company pioneering genome editing and gene delivery platforms to address rare and serious diseases from infancy through adulthood. The total consideration was $72m. Cash of $68m was paid on the completion date, with $4m of outstanding options, which will be settled in cash, recorded in current Trade and other payables. Goodwill of $15m, assets of $82m, including $46m of intangible assets, and liabilities of $25m were recognised on acquisition. LogicBio's results have been consolidated into the Group's results from 16 November 2022.\n\n## Acquisitions of business operations in 2021\n\nOn 21 July 2021, AstraZeneca completed the acquisition of 100% of the issued shares of Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc (Alexion), based in Boston, MA, US. Alexion is a global biopharmaceutical company focused on serving patients and families affected by rare diseases and devastating conditions through the discovery, development and commercialisation of life-changing medicines.\n\nAt closing, Alexion shareholders received 2.1243 AstraZeneca American Depositary Shares (ADSs) and $60 in cash for each of their Alexion shares. Unvested Alexion employee share awards were converted to equivalent AstraZeneca share awards. The fair value of the purchase consideration was $41,058m, comprising AstraZeneca ADSs of $27,196m, cash of $13,349m and replacement employee share awards of $513m.\n\nThe Group funded the cash element of the acquisition with $8bn of new long-term debt, issued in May and June 2021, $4bn of term loans drawn in July 2021 under the $17.5bn committed bank facilities entered into in December 2020 to secure the acquisition financing, and existing cash balances. The Group cancelled the remaining $13.5bn of the facilities in June, July and October 2021. Loans and borrowings of $2.3bn acquired with Alexion were repaid in full shortly following completion of the acquisition.\n\nThe acquisition was accounted for as a business combination using the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with IFRS 3 'Business Combinations' and consequently the Alexion assets acquired, and liabilities assumed, were recorded by AstraZeneca at fair value, with the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities being recognised as goodwill.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAs part of the Alexion acquisition in 2021, we identified the assets (comprising principally launched products and IPR&D post pre-clinical stage) and liabilities acquired. Attributing fair values to assets acquired and liabilities assumed as part of business combinations is considered to be a key judgement. The purchase price allocation was performed with assistance from an independent valuer to advise on the valuation techniques and key assumptions in the valuation, in particular in respect of the valuation of the intangible assets and inventory.",

These were fair valued using the multi-period excess earnings method, which uses a number of estimates regarding the amount and timing of future cash flows. The key assumptions in the cash flows are the probability of technical and regulatory success, peak year sales and revenue erosion curves. In accordance with the Group's policy on impairment assessments as set out on page 159, the assets were assessed for impairment in the final quarter of 2023, 2022 and 2021. Future milestones have been included in the valuation of the intangible assets (as a deduction of cash flows).\n\nThe fair value of inventory, which includes raw materials, work in progress and finished goods related to the launched products was estimated at $6,769m, an uplift of $5,635m on the carrying value prior to the acquisition. The fair value adjustment relates only to work in progress and finished goods and was calculated as the estimated selling price less costs to complete and sell the inventory, associated margins on these activities and holding costs. As at 31 December 2023, the fair value uplift has been fully unwound.\n\nProperty, plant and equipment principally comprises the manufacturing facilities in Dublin and Athlone, Ireland and was fair valued using a cost approach. The estimated fair value of $1,135m represents an uplift of $111m over carrying value.\n\nThe estimated fair value of contingent liabilities was $76m, relating to various claims and disputes in each case where there is a possible, but not probable, future financial exposure, and involve an assessment of the likelihood of a number of scenarios in relation to those matters. This amount has been included within other non-current liabilities of $697m.\n\nThe estimated fair value of trade and other receivables was $2,096m, which approximated the contractual cash flows.\n\nThe net deferred tax position reflected an adjustment of $5,215m related to the deferred tax impact of the fair value uplifts on intangible assets, inventories, property, plant and equipment and contingent liabilities as described above.",

        "page_content": "Goodwill amounting to $8,287m was recognised on acquisition and is underpinned by a number of elements, which individually could not be quantified. Most significant among these is the premium attributable to a pre-existing, well-positioned business in the innovation-intensive, high-growth rare diseases market with a highly skilled workforce and established reputation. Other important elements include the potential unidentified products that future research and development may yield and the core technological capabilities and knowledge base of the company. Goodwill is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes.\n\nNon-controlling interests reflect Alexion's pre-existing minority equity interest in Caelum Biosciences and have been valued at $150m, the agreedupon exercise price for the exclusive option to acquire the remaining equity. The option was exercised on 28 September 2021 and the acquisition of Caelum Biosciences closed shortly thereafter on 5 October 2021 (Note 26).\n\nAlexion's results have been consolidated into the Group's results from 21 July 2021. For the period from acquisition to 31 December 2021, before reflecting the fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition, Alexion's Total Revenues were $3,071m and Profit after tax was $889m. If the acquisition had taken effect at the beginning of the reporting period in which the acquisition occurred (1 January 2021), on a pro forma basis, after reflecting the fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition, the Total Revenue of the combined Group for the year ended 31 December 2021 would have been $41,132m and the Loss after tax would have been $1,152m. This pro forma information does not purport to represent the results of the combined Group that actually would have occurred had the acquisition taken place on 1 January 2021 and should not be taken to be representative of future results.\n\nTotal acquisition-related costs of $5m (2022: $4m; 2021: $171m) have been incurred by the Group, which include advisory, legal and other professional fees. These costs are presented in the Statement of Comprehensive Income within Selling, general and administrative expense and Finance expense.\n\nThe terms of the acquisition include a retention bonus plan for legacy Alexion employees whereby up to $50m may be used for retention bonus awards to employees at the level of Vice President or below. In 2023, $nil costs were recorded in the Statement of Comprehensive Income (2022: $3m; 2021: $24m). These bonuses vested and were paid six months after the acquisition, or earlier.\n\nUpon completion of the acquisition, all unvested Alexion employee share awards were converted into AstraZeneca restricted stock awards that continue to have, and shall be subject to, the same terms and conditions as applied in the corresponding Alexion awards immediately prior to completion. Alexion Performance Stock Plan (PSU) awards that included performance-based vesting conditions were converted using the greater of the original target level and Alexion's assessment of the level of achievement immediately prior to completion (subject to a limit of 175% for the awards granted in 2019 and a limit of 150% for the awards granted in 2020). In the year, a cost of $48m (2022: $257m; 2021: $257m) has been recorded in the Statement of Comprehensive Income, $nil (2022: $9m; 2021: $9m) in Cost of sales, $16m (2022: $92m; 2021: $73m) in Research and development expense and $32m (2022: $156m; 2021: $175m) in Selling, general and administrative expense. Payments made to the Employee Benefit Trust upon vesting of share awards recognised as part of the consideration for the acquisition of Alexion are recognised within investing activities in the Group's Statement of Cash Flows as the cash payment relates to the settlement of the obligation that arose on the acquisition of Alexion that was included as part of the consideration for the acquisition.\n\n## 28 Financial risk management objectives and policies\n\nThe Group's principal financial instruments, other than derivatives, comprise bank overdrafts, loans and other borrowings, lease liabilities, current and non-current investments, cash and short-term deposits. The main purpose of these financial instruments is to manage the Group's funding and liquidity requirements. The Group has other financial assets and liabilities such as trade receivables and trade payables, which arise directly from its operations.\n\nThe principal financial risks to which the Group is exposed are those of liquidity, interest rate, foreign currency and credit. Each of these is managed in accordance with Board-approved policies. These policies, together with the Group's approach to capital management, are set out below.\n\n## Capital management\n\nThe capital structure of the Group consists of Shareholders' equity (Note 24), Debt (Note 19), Other current investments (Note 12) and Cash (Note 17). For the foreseeable future, the Board will maintain a capital structure that supports the Group's strategic objectives through:\n\n- >  managing funding and liquidity risk\n- >  optimising shareholder return\n- >  maintaining a strong, investment-grade credit rating.\n\nThe Group utilises factoring arrangements and bank acceptance drafts discounting for selected trade receivables. These arrangements qualify for full derecognition of the associated trade receivables under IFRS 9. Amounts due on invoices that have not been factored at year end, from customers that are subject to these arrangements, are disclosed in Note 16.\n\nFunding and liquidity risk are reviewed regularly by the Board and managed in accordance with the policies described below.\n\nThe Board regularly reviews its shareholders' distribution policy, which comprises a regular cash dividend and potentially a share repurchase component. No share repurchases have been made since 2012.\n\nThe Group's net debt position (loans and borrowings net of Cash and cash equivalents, Other investments and Derivative financial instruments) has decreased from a net debt position of $22,923m at the beginning of the year to a net debt position of $22,510m at 31 December 2023.",

The Board considers short-term requirements against available sources of funding, taking into account forecast cash flows. The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining access to a number of sources of funding which are sufficient to meet anticipated funding requirements. Specifically, the Group uses US and European commercial paper, bank loans, committed bank facilities and cash resources to manage short-term liquidity and manages long-term liquidity by raising funds through the capital markets. At 31 December 2023, the Group was assigned short-term credit ratings of P-1 by Moody's and A-1 by Standard and Poor's. The Group's long-term credit rating was A2 Stable outlook by Moody's and A Stable outlook by Standard and Poor's.\n\nIn addition to Cash and cash equivalents of $5,840m, short-term fixed income investments of $20m, less overdrafts of $203m at 31 December 2023, the Group has committed bank facilities of $6,875m available to manage liquidity. These committed bank facilities have no financial covenants. $2,000m mature in February 2025. The maturity of the $4,875m facilities was extended in February 2024 from April 2026 to April 2029. The Group regularly monitors the credit standing of the banks providing the facilities and currently does not anticipate any issue with drawing on the committed facilities should this be necessary. Advances under these facilities currently bear an interest rate per annum based on SOFR (Secured Overnight Financing Rate) plus a margin.\n\nAt 31 December 2023, the Group has $4,855m outstanding from debt issued under a Euro Medium Term Note programme and $19,959m under a SEC-registered programme. The funds made available under these facility agreements may be used for the general corporate purposes of the Group.\n\nThe maturity profile of the anticipated future contractual cash flows including interest in relation to the Group's financial liabilities, on an undiscounted basis and which, therefore, differs from both the carrying value and fair value, is as follows:\n\n|                                                    | Bank overdrafts and other loans $m   | Bonds and bank loans $m   | Lease liability $m   | and other payables $m   | Total Trade non-derivative financial instruments $m   | Derivative financial instruments receivable $m   | Derivative financial instruments payable $m   | Total derivative financial instruments $m   | Total $m   |\n|----------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|---------------------------|----------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|------------|\n| Within one year                                    | 387                                  | 1,981                     | 256                  | 19,007                  | 21,631                                                | (11,766)                                         | 11,774                                        | 8                                           | 21,639     |\n| In one to two years                                | -

As a result, operating profit and total cash flow in US dollars will be affected by movements in exchange rates.\n\nThis currency exposure is managed centrally, based on forecast cash flows. The impact of movements in exchange rates is mitigated significantly by the correlations which exist between the major currencies to which the Group is exposed and the US dollar. Monitoring of currency exposures and correlations is undertaken on a regular basis and hedging is subject to pre-execution approval.\n\nAs at 31 December 2023, before the impact of derivatives, 2% of interest-bearing loans and borrowings were denominated in pound sterling and 16% were denominated in euros. Where there is non-US dollar debt and an underlying net investment of that amount in the same currency, the Group applies net investment hedging. Exchange differences on the retranslation of debt designated as net investment hedges are recognised in Other comprehensive income to the extent that the hedge is effective. Any ineffectiveness is taken to profit. For details of non-US dollar debt in a designated hedging relationship please see the Hedge accounting section within this Note 28 from page 200.\n\nThe Group holds cross-currency swaps to hedge against the impact of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. Fair value movements on the revaluation of the cross-currency swaps are recognised in Other comprehensive income to the extent that the hedge is effective, with any ineffectiveness taken to profit.\n\nAs at 31 December 2023, the Group operates in three countries designated as hyperinflationary, being Argentina, Venezuela and Turkey. The foreign exchange risk of these markets has been assessed and deemed to be immaterial.\n\n## Transactional\n\nThe Group aims to hedge all its forecasted major transactional currency exposures on working capital balances, which typically extend for up to three months. Where practicable, these are hedged using forward foreign exchange contracts. In addition, external dividend payments in pound sterling to UK shareholders and in Swedish krona to Swedish shareholders are fully hedged from announcement date to payment date. Foreign exchange gains and losses on forward contracts transacted for transactional hedging are taken to profit or to Other comprehensive income if the contract is in a designated cash flow hedge.",

The range of variables chosen for the sensitivity analysis reflects our view of changes which are reasonably possible over a one-year period. Market values are the present value of future cash flows based on market rates and prices at the valuation date. For long-term debt, an increase in interest rates results in a decline in the fair value of debt.\n\nThe sensitivity analysis assumes an instantaneous 100 basis point change in interest rates in all currencies from their levels at 31 December 2023, with all other variables held constant. Based on the composition of our long-term debt portfolio and cash reserves as at 31 December 2023, a 1% increase in interest rates would result in an additional $25m in interest expense on the debt and an additional $58m interest income on the cash reserves. The exchange rate sensitivity analysis assumes an instantaneous 10% change in foreign currency exchange rates from their levels at 31 December 2023, with all other variables held constant. The +10% case assumes a 10% strengthening of the US dollar against all other currencies and the -10% case assumes a 10% weakening of the US dollar.\n\nEach incremental 10% movement in foreign currency exchange rates would have approximately the same effect as the initial 10% detailed in the table below and each incremental 1% change in interest rates would have approximately the same effect as the 1% detailed in the table below.\n\n|                                                                 | Interest rates   | Interest rates   | Exchange rates   | Exchange rates   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|\n| 31 December 2021                                                | +1%              | -1%              | +10%             | -10%             |\n| Increase/(decrease) in fair value of financial instruments ($m) | 1,978            | ( 2,10 6)        | 82               | (85)             |\n| Impact on profit: gain/(loss) ($m)                              | -                | -                | 24               | (9)              |\n| Impact on equity: gain/(loss) ($m)                              | -                | -                | 58               | (76)             |\n\n|                                                                 | Interest rates   | Interest rates   | Exchange rates   | Exchange rates   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|\n| 31 December 2022                                                | +1%              | -1%              | +10%             | -10%             |\n| Increase/(decrease) in fair value of financial instruments ($m) | 1,317            | (1,490)          | 81               | (89)             |\n| Impact on profit: gain/(loss) ($m)                              | -                | -                | 26               | (15)             |\n| Impact on equity: gain/(loss) ($m)                              | -                | -                | 55               | ( 74)            |\n\n|                                                                 | Interest rates   | Interest rates   | Exchange rates   | Exchange rates   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|\n| 31 December 2023                                                | +1%              | -1%              | +10%             | -10%             |\n| Increase/(decrease) in fair value of financial instruments ($m) | 1,361            | (1,534)          | 196              | (212)            |\n| Impact on profit: gain/(loss) ($m)                              | -                | -                | 134              | (128)            |\n| Impact on equity: gain/(loss) ($m)                              | -                | -                | 62               | (83)             |\n\n## Credit risk\n\nThe Group is exposed to credit risk on financial assets, such as cash investments, derivative instruments, and Trade and other receivables. The Group was also exposed in its Net asset position to its own credit risk in respect of the 2023 debentures which are accounted for at FVPL. Under IFRS 9, the effect of the losses and gains arising from own credit risk on the fair value of bonds designated at FVPL are recorded in Other comprehensive income.\n\n## Financial counterparty credit risk\n\nThe majority of the AstraZeneca Group's cash is centralised within the Group treasury entity and is subject to counterparty risk on the principal invested. The level of the Group's cash investments and hence credit risk will depend on the cash flow generated by the Group and the timing of the use of that cash. The credit risk is mitigated through a policy of prioritising security and liquidity over return and, as such, cash is only invested in high credit-quality investments. Counterparty limits are set according to the assessed risk of each counterparty and exposures are monitored against these limits on a regular basis.\n\nThe Group's principal financial counterparty credit risks at 31 December 2023 were as follows:\n\n## Current assets\n\n|                                                                        | 2023 $m   | 2022 $m   | 2021 $m   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| Cash at bank and in hand                                               | 1,325     | 1,411     | 1,461     |\n| Money market liquidity funds                                           | 4,425     | 4,486     | 4,772     |\n| Other short-term cash equivalents                                      | 90        | 269       | 96        |\n| Total Cash and cash equivalents (Note 17)                              | 5,840     | 6,166     | 6,329     |\n| Fixed income securities at fair value through profit or loss (Note 12) | 20        | 13        | 16        |\n| Cash collateral pledged to counterparties (Note 12)                    | 102       | 162       | -         |\n| Fixed deposits (Note 12)                                               | -         | 64        | 53        |\n| Total derivative financial instruments (Note 13)                       | 116       | 87        | 83        |\n| Current assets subject to credit risk                                  | 6,078     | 6,492     | 6,481     |\n| Non-current assets                                                     |           |           |           |\n|                                                                        | 2023 $m   | 2022 $m   | 2021 $m   |\n| Derivative financial instruments (Note 13)                             | 228       | 74        | 102       |\n| Non-current assets subject to credit risk                              | 228       | 74        | 102       |",

        "page_content": "The majority of the Group's cash is invested in US dollar AAA-rated money market liquidity funds. The money market liquidity fund portfolios are managed by six external third-party fund managers to maintain an AAA rating. The Group's investments represent no more than 10% of each overall fund value. There were no other significant concentrations of financial credit risk at the reporting date.\n\nAll financial derivatives are transacted with commercial banks, in line with standard market practice. The Group has agreements with some bank counterparties whereby the parties agree to post cash collateral, for the benefit of the other, equivalent to the market valuation of the derivative positions above a predetermined threshold. The carrying value of such cash collateral held by the Group at 31 December 2023 was $215m (2022: $89m; 2021: $93m) and the carrying value of such cash collateral posted by the Group at 31 December 2023 was $102m (2022: $162m; 2021: $47m).\n\nThe impairment provision for other financial assets at 31 December 2023 was immaterial.\n\n## Trade receivables\n\nTrade receivable exposures are managed locally in the operating units where they arise and credit limits are set as deemed appropriate for the customer. The Group is exposed to customers ranging from government-backed agencies and large private wholesalers to privately owned pharmacies, and the underlying local economic and sovereign risks vary throughout the world. Where appropriate, the Group endeavours to minimise risks by the use of trade finance instruments such as letters of credit and insurance. The Group applies the expected credit loss approach to establish an allowance for impairment that represents its estimate of expected losses in respect of Trade receivables.\n\nThe Group applies the IFRS 9 simplified approach to measuring expected credit losses which uses a lifetime expected loss allowance to Trade receivables. To measure expected credit losses, Trade receivables have been grouped based on shared credit characteristics and the days past due.\n\nThe expected loss rates are based on payment profiles over a period of 36 months before 31 December 2023, 31 December 2022 or 31 December 2021 respectively and the corresponding historical credit losses experienced within this period. The historical loss rates are adjusted to reflect current and forward-looking information on macroeconomic factors affecting the ability of the customer to settle the receivables.\n\nOn that basis, the loss allowance was determined as follows:\n\n| 31 December 2021           | Current   | 0-90 days past due   | 90-180 days past due   | Over 180 days past due   | Total   |\n|----------------------------|-----------|----------------------|------------------------|--------------------------|---------|\n| Expected loss rate         | 0.1%      | 1.2%                 | 22.6%                  | 11.0%                    |         |\n| Gross carrying amount ($m) | 5,617     | 328                  | 18                     | 91                       | 6,054   |\n| Loss allowance ($m)        | 5         | 4                    | 4                      | 10                       | 23      |\n\n| 31 December 2022           | Current   | 0-90 days past due   | 90-180 days past due   | Over 180 days past due   | Total   |\n|----------------------------|-----------|----------------------|------------------------|--------------------------|---------|\n| Expected loss rate         | 0.03%     | 0.3%                 | 32.0%                  | 40.6%                    |         |\n| Gross carrying amount ($m) | 6,791     | 331                  | 50                     | 99                       | 7, 271  |\n| Loss allowance ($m)        | 2         | 1                    | 16                     | 40                       | 59      |\n\n| 31 December 2023           | Current   | 0-90 days past due   | 90-180 days past due   | Over 180 days past due   | Total   |\n|----------------------------|-----------|----------------------|------------------------|--------------------------|---------|\n| Expected loss rate         | 0.01%     | 0.3%                 | 0.8%                   | 15.0%                    |         |\n| Gross carrying amount ($m) | 7,709     | 342                  | 121                    | 280                      | 8,452   |\n| Loss allowance ($m)        | 1         | 1                    | 1                      | 42                       | 45      |\n\nTrade receivables are written off where there is no reasonable expectation of recovery.\n\nImpairment losses on Trade receivables are presented as net impairment losses within Operating profit, any subsequent recoveries are credited against the same line.\n\nIn the US, sales to three wholesalers accounted for approximately 80% of US sales (2022: three wholesalers accounted for approximately 73%; 2021: three wholesalers accounted for approximately 94%).\n\nThe movements of the Group expected credit losses provision are follows:\n\n|                                                | 2023 $m   | 2022 $m   | 2021 $m   |\n|------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| At 1 January                                   | 59        | 23        | 23        |\n| Net movement recognised in income statement    | (14)      | 37        | (2)       |\n| Amounts utilised, exchange and other movements | -         | (1)       | 2         |\n| At 31 December                                 | 45        | 59        | 23        |\n\nGiven the profile of our customers, including large wholesalers and government-backed agencies, no further credit risk has been identified with the Trade receivables not past due other than those balances for which an allowance has been made.

The Group may designate certain financial instruments as fair value hedges, cash flow hedges or net investment hedges in accordance with IFRS 9. Hedge effectiveness is determined at the inception of the hedge relationship, and through periodic prospective effectiveness assessments to ensure that an economic relationship exists between the hedged item and hedging instrument. Sources of hedge effectiveness will depend on the hedge relationship designation but may include:\n\n- >  a significant change in the credit risk of either party to the hedging relationship\n- >  a timing mismatch between the hedging instrument and the hedged item\n- >  movements in foreign currency basis spread for derivatives in a fair value hedge\n- >  a significant change in the value of the foreign currency-denominated net assets of the Group in a net investment hedge.\n\nThe hedge ratio for each designation will be established by comparing the quantity of the hedging instrument and the quantity of the hedged item to determine their relative weighting; for all of the Group's existing hedge relationships the hedge ratio has been determined as 1:1. Designated hedges are expected to be effective and therefore the impact of ineffectiveness on profit is not expected to be material.

The remaining EUR 250m was subsequently designated in a net investment hedge upon maturity of the EUR 450m bond on 24 November 2021.\n\nKey controls applied to transactions in derivative financial instruments are to use only instruments where good market liquidity exists, to revalue all financial instruments regularly using current market rates and to sell options only to offset previously purchased options or as part of a risk management strategy. The Group is not a net seller of options, and does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. The Group held no options during the reporting period.\n\n## 29 Employee costs and share plans for employees\n\n## Employee costs\n\nThe monthly average number of people, to the nearest hundred, employed by the Group is set out in the table below. In accordance with the Companies Act 2006, this includes part-time employees.\n\n|                            | 2023   | 2022   | 2021   |\n|----------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Employees                  |        |        |        |\n| UK                         | 10,700 | 9,800  | 8,900  |\n| Rest of Europe             | 23,000 | 20,600 | 18,300 |\n| The Americas               | 22,400 | 20,900 | 18,800 |\n| Asia, Africa & Australasia | 30,300 | 30,700 | 33,600 |\n| Continuing operations      | 86,400 | 82,000 | 79,600 |\n\nGeographical distribution described in the table above is by location of legal entity employing staff. Certain staff will undertake some or all of their activity in a different location.\n\nThe number of people employed by the Group at the end of 2023 was 89,900 (2022: 83,500; 2021: 83,100).\n\nThe costs incurred during the year in respect of these employees were:\n\n|                        | 2023 $m   | 2022 $m   | 2021 $m   |\n|------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| Wages and salaries     | 9,341     | 8,656     | 7,633     |\n| Social security costs  | 1,100     | 991       | 886       |\n| Pension costs          | 537       | 546       | 564       |\n| Other employment costs | 1,357     | 1,338     | 1,192     |\n| Total                  | 12,335    | 11,531    | 10,275    |\n\nSeverance costs of $123m are not included above (2022: $227m; 2021: $238m).\n\nThe charge for share-based payments in respect of share plans is $579m (2022: $619m; 2021: $615m). Payments made to the Employee Benefit Trust upon vesting of share awards are recognised within operating cash flows, reflecting the substance of the arrangement in place between the Group and the Trust. The plans are equity settled.\n\nThe Directors believe that, together with the basic salary system, the Group's employee incentive schemes provide competitive and market-related packages to motivate employees. They should also align the interests of employees with those of shareholders, as a whole, through long-term share ownership in the Company. The Group's current US, UK and Swedish schemes are described below; other arrangements apply elsewhere.",

Performance bonuses are paid in cash. The AstraZeneca Performance Share Plan and the AstraZeneca Global Restricted Share Plan operate in respect of relevant employees in the US. AstraZeneca ADRs necessary to satisfy the awards are purchased on the market or funded via a trust.\n\n## UK\n\n## The AstraZeneca UK Performance Bonus Plan\n\nEmployees of participating AstraZeneca UK companies are invited to participate in this bonus plan, which rewards strong individual performance. Bonuses are paid in cash.\n\n## The AstraZeneca UK All-Employee Share Plan\n\nThe Company offers UK employees the opportunity to buy Partnership Shares (Ordinary Shares). Employees may invest up to \u00a3150 a month to purchase Partnership Shares in the Company at the current market value. In 2010, the Company introduced a Matching Share element, the first award of which was made in 2011. Currently one Matching Share is awarded for every four Partnership Shares purchased. Partnership Shares and Matching Shares are held in the HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC)-approved All-Employee Share Plan. At the Company's AGM in 2002, shareholders approved the issue of new shares for the purposes of the All-Employee Share Plan.\n\n## Sweden\n\nIn Sweden, an all-employee performance bonus plan is in operation, which rewards strong individual performance. Bonuses are paid 50% into a fund investing in AstraZeneca equities and 50% in cash. The AstraZeneca Executive Annual Bonus Scheme, the AstraZeneca Performance Share Plan and the AstraZeneca Global Restricted Stock Plan all operate in respect of relevant AstraZeneca employees in Sweden.\n\nOther bonus and share plans that operate across the Group are described below.\n\n## The AstraZeneca Executive Annual Bonus Scheme\n\nThis scheme is a performance bonus scheme for Directors and senior employees who do not participate in the AstraZeneca UK Performance Bonus Plan. Annual bonuses are paid in cash and reflect both corporate and individual performance measures. The Remuneration Committee has discretion to reduce or withhold bonuses if business performance falls sufficiently short of expectations in any year such as to make the payment of bonuses inappropriate.\n\n## The AstraZeneca Deferred Bonus Plan\n\nThis plan was introduced in 2006 and is used to defer a portion of the bonus earned under the AstraZeneca Executive Annual Bonus Scheme into Ordinary Shares in the Company for a period of three years. The plan currently operates only in respect of Executive Directors and members of the SET (with awards granted as AstraZeneca ADRs for members of SET employed within the US). Awards of shares under this plan are typically made in March each year, the first award having been made in February 2006.\n\n## The AstraZeneca Performance Share Plan\n\nThis plan was approved by shareholders in 2020 for a period of 10 years (subsequently amended by approval of shareholders in 2021) and replaces the 2014 AstraZeneca Performance Share Plan. Generally, awards can be granted at any time, but not during a closed period of the Company. The first grant of Performance Share Plan awards was made in May 2014 under the 2014 AstraZeneca Performance Share Plan. Awards granted under the plan vest after three years, or in the case of Executive Directors and members of the SET, after an additional two-year holding period, and is subject to the achievement of performance conditions. For awards granted to all participants in 2023, vesting is subject to a combination of measures focused on science and innovation, revenue growth, financial performance and carbon reduction. The Remuneration Committee has responsibility for agreeing any awards under the plan and for setting the policy for the way in which the plan should be operated, including agreeing performance targets and which employees should be eligible to participate.\n\n## The AstraZeneca Investment Plan\n\nThis plan was introduced in 2010 and approved by shareholders at the 2010 AGM. The final grant of awards under this plan took place in March 2016. Awards granted under the plan vest after eight years and are subject to performance conditions measured over a period of four years.\n\n## The AstraZeneca Global Restricted Stock Plan\n\nThe Global Restricted Stock Plan (GRSP) was introduced in 2010. This plan provides for the grant of restricted stock unit (RSU) awards to selected below SET-level employees and is used in conjunction with the AstraZeneca Performance Share Plan to provide a mix of RSUs and performance share units (PSUs). Awards typically vest on the third anniversary of the date of grant and are contingent on continued employment with the Company. The Remuneration Committee has responsibility for agreeing any awards under the plan and for setting the policy for the way in which the plan should be operated.\n\n## The AstraZeneca Restricted Share Plan\n\nThis plan was introduced in 2008 and provides for the grant of restricted share unit (RSU) awards to key employees, excluding Executive Directors. Awards are made on an ad hoc basis with variable vesting dates. The plan has been used five times in 2023 to make awards to 305 employees. The Remuneration Committee has responsibility for agreeing any awards under the plan and for setting the policy for the way in which the plan should be operated.",

The fair value at the grant date was $57.54 and of the 15,220,000 shares outstanding at 31 December 2021, 8,627,000 were exercised and 980,000 were forfeited during 2022. During 2022, Alexion employees had the option to defer awards due to vest in July 2022 until February 2023 when they would also receive an additional vest equivalent to 15% of the shares deferred. As a result, 1,780,000 shares were deferred, resulting in an additional 267,000 shares being issued with a grant date fair value of $65.62, that vested in 2023. During 2023, 2,060,000 shares vested, 531,000 were forfeited/cancelled and the closing balance of these awards as of 31 December 2023 was 3,022,000.\n\nThe weighted average fair value for awards granted under the AstraZeneca Performance Share Plan is primarily based on the market price at the point of grant adjusted for the market-based performance elements which are valued using a modified version of the Monte Carlo method. The fair values of all other plans are set using the market price at the point of award. These awards are settled in equity including dividends accumulated from the date of award to vesting.",

Such collaborations may require the Group to make payments on achievement of stages of development, launch or revenue milestones, although the Group generally has the right to terminate these agreements at no cost. The Group recognises research and development milestones as an intangible asset once it is committed to payment, which is generally when the Group reaches set trigger points in the development cycle. Revenue-related milestones are recognised as intangible assets on product launch at a value based on the Group's long-term revenue forecasts for the related product. The table below indicates potential development and revenue-related payments that the Group may be required to make under such collaborations.\n\n|                                                              | Total $m   | Under 1 year $m   | Years 1 and 2 $m   | Years 3 and 4 $m   | Years 5 and greater $m   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------|------------|-------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------------|\n| Future potential research and development milestone payments | 10,971     | 1,256             | 3,798              | 1,764              | 4,153                    |\n| Future potential revenue milestone payments                  | 20,195     | 43                | 491                | 2,400              | 17,261                   |\n\nThe table includes all potential payments for achievement of milestones under ongoing research and development arrangements. Revenue-related milestone payments represent the maximum possible amount payable on achievement of specified levels of revenue as set out in individual contract agreements, but exclude variable payments that are based on unit sales (e.g. royalty-type payments) which are expensed as the associated sale is recognised. The table excludes any payments already capitalised in the Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2023 which have been capitalised with reference to the latest Group sales forecasts for approved indications.\n\nThe future payments we disclose represent contracted payments and, as such, are not discounted and are not risk-adjusted. As detailed in the Risk section from page 54, the development of any pharmaceutical product candidate is a complex and risky process that may fail at any stage in the development process due to a number of factors (including items such as failure to obtain regulatory approval, unfavourable data from key studies, adverse reactions to the product candidate or indications of other safety concerns). The timing of the payments is based on the Group's current best estimate of achievement of the relevant milestone.\n\n## Environmental costs and liabilities\n\nThe Group's expenditure on environmental protection, including both capital and revenue items, relates to costs that are necessary for implementing internal systems and programmes, and meeting legal and regulatory requirements for processes and products. This includes investment to conserve natural resources and otherwise minimise the impact of our activities on the environment.\n\nThey are an integral part of normal ongoing expenditure for carrying out the Group's research, manufacturing and commercial operations and are not separated from overall operating and development costs. There are no known changes in legal, regulatory or other requirements resulting in material changes to the levels of expenditure for 2021, 2022 or 2023.\n\nIn addition to expenditure for meeting current and foreseen environmental protection requirements, the Group incurs costs in investigating and cleaning up legacy land and groundwater contamination. In particular, AstraZeneca has environmental liabilities at some currently or formerly owned, leased and third-party sites.\n\nIn the US, Zeneca Inc., and/or its indemnitees, have been named as potentially responsible parties (PRPs) or defendants at a number of sites where Zeneca Inc. is likely to incur future environmental investigation, remediation, operation and maintenance costs under federal, state, statutory or common law environmental liability allocation schemes (together, US Environmental Consequences). Similarly, Stauffer Management Company LLC (SMC), which was established in 1987 to own and manage certain assets of Stauffer Chemical Company acquired that year, and/or its indemnitees, have been named as PRPs or defendants at a number of sites where SMC is likely to incur US Environmental Consequences.\n\nAstraZeneca has also given indemnities to third parties for a number of sites outside the US. These environmental liabilities arise from legacy operations that are not currently part of the Group's business and, at most of these sites, remediation, where required, is either completed or in progress. AstraZeneca has made provisions for the estimated costs of future environmental investigation, remediation, operation and maintenance activity beyond normal ongoing expenditure for maintaining the Group's R&D and manufacturing capacity and product ranges, where a present obligation exists, it is probable that such costs will be incurred and they can be estimated reliably. With respect to such estimated future costs, there were provisions at 31 December 2023 in the aggregate of $112m (2022: $131m; 2021: $90m), mainly relating to the US. Where we are jointly liable or otherwise have cost-sharing agreements with third parties, we reflect only our share of the obligation. Where the liability is insured in part or in whole by insurance or other arrangements for reimbursement, an asset is recognised to the extent that this recovery is virtually certain.\n\nIt is possible that AstraZeneca could incur future environmental costs beyond the extent of our current provisions. The extent of such possible additional costs is inherently difficult to estimate due to a number of factors, including: (1) the nature and extent of claims that may be asserted in the future; (2) whether AstraZeneca has or will have any legal obligation with respect to asserted or unasserted claims; (3) the type of remedial action, if any, that may be selected at sites where the remedy is presently not known; (4) the potential for recoveries from or allocation of liability to third parties; and (5) the length of time that the environmental investigation, remediation and liability allocation process can take. As per our accounting policy on page 158, Provisions for these costs are made when there is a present obligation and where it is probable that expenditure on remedial work will be required and a reliable estimate can be made of the cost. Notwithstanding and subject to the foregoing, we estimate the potential additional loss for future environmental investigation, remediation, remedial operation and maintenance activity above and beyond our provisions to be, in aggregate, between $114m and $191m (2022: $113m and $188m; 2021: $99m and $165m) which relates mainly to the US.",

        "page_content": "## Legal proceedings\n\nAstraZeneca is involved in various legal proceedings considered typical to its business, including actual or threatened litigation and actual or potential government investigations relating to employment matters, product liability, commercial disputes, pricing, sales and marketing practices, infringement of IP rights, and the validity of certain patents and competition laws. The more significant matters are discussed below.\n\nMost of the claims involve highly complex issues. Often these issues are subject to substantial uncertainties and, therefore, the probability of a loss, if any, being sustained and/or an estimate of the amount of any loss is difficult to ascertain.\n\nWe do not believe that disclosure of the amounts sought by plaintiffs, if known, would be meaningful with respect to these legal proceedings. This is due to a number of factors, including (i) the stage of the proceedings (in many cases trial dates have not been set) and the overall length and extent of pre-trial discovery; (ii) the entitlement of the parties to an action to appeal a decision; (iii) clarity as to theories of liability, damages and governing law; (iv) uncertainties in timing of litigation; and (v) the possible need for further legal proceedings to establish the appropriate amount of damages, if any.\n\nWhile there can be no assurance regarding the outcome of any of the legal proceedings referred to in this Note 30, based on management's current and considered view of each situation, we do not currently expect them to have a material adverse effect on our financial position including within the next financial year. This position could of course change over time, not least because of the factors referred to above.\n\nIn cases that have been settled or adjudicated, or where quantifiable fines and penalties have been assessed and which are not subject to appeal (or other similar forms of relief), or where a loss is probable and we are able to make a reasonable estimate of the loss, we generally indicate the loss absorbed or make a provision for our best estimate of the expected loss.\n\nWhere it is considered that the Group is more likely than not to prevail, legal costs involved in defending the claim are charged to profit as they are incurred.\n\nWhere it is considered that the Group has a valid contract which provides the right to reimbursement (from insurance or otherwise) of legal costs and/or all or part of any loss incurred or for which a provision has been established, and we consider recovery to be virtually certain, the best estimate of the amount expected to be received is recognised as an asset.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Assessments as to whether or not to\n\nrecognise provisions or assets, and of the amounts concerned, usually involve a series of complex judgements about future events and can rely heavily on estimates and assumptions. AstraZeneca believes that the provisions recorded are adequate based on currently available information and that the insurance recoveries recorded will be received. However, given the inherent uncertainties involved in assessing the outcomes of these cases, and in estimating the amount of the potential losses and the associated insurance recoveries, we could in the future incur judgments or insurance settlements that could have a material adverse effect on our results in any particular period.\n\nIP claims include challenges to the Group's patents on various products or processes and assertions of non-infringement of patents. A loss in any of these cases could result in loss of patent protection on the related product.\n\nThe consequences of any such loss could be a significant decrease in Product Sales, which could have a material adverse effect on our results. The lawsuits filed by AstraZeneca for patent infringement against companies that have filed abbreviated new drug applications (ANDAs) in the US, seeking to market generic forms of products sold by the Group prior to the expiry of the applicable patents covering these products, typically also involve allegations of non-infringement, invalidity and unenforceability of these patents by the ANDA filers. In the event that the Group is unsuccessful in these actions or the statutory 30-month stay expires before a ruling is obtained, the ANDA filers involved will also have the ability, subject to FDA approval, to introduce generic versions of the product concerned.\n\nAstraZeneca has full confidence in, and will vigorously defend and enforce, its IP.\n\nOver the course of the past several years, including in 2023, a significant number of commercial litigation claims in which AstraZeneca is involved have been resolved, particularly in the US, thereby reducing potential contingent liability exposure arising from such litigation. Similarly, in part due to patent litigation and settlement developments, greater certainty has been achieved regarding possible generic entry dates with respect to some of our patented products. At the same time, like other companies in the pharmaceutical sector and other industries, AstraZeneca continues to be subject to government investigations around the world.\n\n## Patent litigation\n\nLegal proceedings brought against AstraZeneca for which a provision has been taken Imfinzi and Imjudo\n\n## US and ROW patent proceedings\n\nIn February 2022, in Japan, Ono Pharmaceuticals filed a lawsuit in Tokyo District Court, Civil Division against AstraZeneca alleging that AstraZeneca's marketing of Imfinzi in Japan infringed several of their patents.\n\nIn March 2022, Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. and E.R.

In October 2023, the District Court entered an amended final judgment that requires Daiichi Sankyo to pay Seagen a royalty of 8% on US sales of Enhertu from April 1, 2022, through November 4, 2024, in addition to the past damages previously awarded by the Court.

Seagen subsequently disclaimed all patent claims at issue in one of the PGR proceedings. In July 2022, the USPTO reversed its institution decision and declined to institute the other PGR petition. AstraZeneca and Daiichi Sankyo, Inc. requested reconsideration of the decision not to institute review of the patent.",

Final judgment was entered in favour of AstraZeneca in May 2023 and this matter is now concluded.\n\n## Other\n\n## Additional government inquiries\n\nAs is true for most, if not all, major prescription pharmaceutical companies, AstraZeneca is currently involved in multiple inquiries into drug marketing and pricing practices. In addition to the investigations described above, various law enforcement offices have, from time to time, requested information from the Group. There have been no material developments in those matters.\n\n## Tax\n\nAstraZeneca considers whether it is probable that a taxation authority will accept an uncertain tax treatment. If it is concluded that it is not probable that the taxation authority will accept an uncertain tax treatment, where tax exposures can be quantified, a tax liability is recognised based on either the most likely amount method or the expected value method depending on which method management expects to better predict the resolution of the uncertainty. Tax liabilities for uncertain tax treatments can be built up over a long period of time but the resolution of such tax exposures usually occurs at a point in time, and given the inherent\n\nuncertainties in assessing the outcomes of these exposures (which sometimes can be binary in nature), we could, in future periods, experience adjustments to the liabilities recognised in respect of uncertain tax treatments that have a material positive or negative effect on our results in any particular period. Details of the movements in relation to material uncertain tax treatments are discussed below.\n\n## AstraZeneca faces a number of audits\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nand reviews in jurisdictions around the world and, in some cases, is in dispute with the tax authorities. The issues under discussion are often complex and can require many years to resolve. Tax liabilities recognised for uncertain tax treatments require management to make key judgements with respect to the outcome of current and potential future tax audits, and actual results could vary from these estimates. Management does not believe a significant risk of material change to uncertain tax positions exists in the next 12 months.\n\nThe total net tax liability recognised in the Group Financial Statements in respect of uncertain tax positions is $1,336m (2022: $830m; 2021: $768m). The net tax liability consists of $1,241m (2022: $632m; 2021: $702m) included within income tax payable, $441m (2022: $291m; 2021: $(33)m) included within deferred tax asset, partially offset by $9m (2022: $(20)m; 2021: $(17)m) included within deferred tax liabilities, and $337m (2022: $113m; 2021: additional $82m) included within income tax receivable.\n\n## Transfer pricing\n\nThe net tax liability included in the Group Financial Statements to cover the worldwide exposure to uncertain tax treatments is $401m (2022: $260m; 2021: $77m). The increase in the net tax liability for uncertain tax positions relating to transfer pricing of $141m compared with 2022 is mainly as a result of an increase of tax liabilities arising from updates to estimates of prior period tax liabilities following progression of tax authority reviews.\n\nThese matters can be complex and judgemental. The liability includes uncertain tax treatments which are estimated using the expected value method and depend on AstraZeneca's assessment of the likelihood of the approach taken by the tax authorities and could change in the future to reflect progress in tax authority reviews, the extent that any tax authority challenge is concluded, or matters lapse including following expiry of the relevant statutes of limitation resulting in a reduction in the tax charge in future periods.\n\nFor transfer pricing matters, including items under tax audit, AstraZeneca estimates the potential for additional tax liabilities above the amount provided where the possibility of the additional liabilities falling due is more than remote, to be up to $386m (2022: $245m; 2021: $48m) including associated interest.",

        "page_content": "## 30 Commitments, contingent liabilities and contingent assets continued\n\nManagement believes that it is unlikely that these additional liabilities will arise. It is possible that some of these contingencies may change in the future to reflect progress in tax authority reviews, to the extent that any tax authority challenge is concluded or matters lapse including following expiry of the relevant statutes of limitation resulting in a reduction in the tax charge in future periods. Management continues to believe that AstraZeneca's positions on all its transfer pricing positions, audits and disputes are robust, and that AstraZeneca has recognised appropriate tax balances, including consideration of whether corresponding relief will be available under Mutual Agreement procedures or unilaterally.\n\n## Other uncertain tax treatments\n\nIncluded in the net tax liability is $935m (2022: $570m; 2021: $691m) relating to a number of other uncertain tax treatments. The increase of $365m in the net tax liability relating to the other uncertain tax treatments mainly relates to an update to tax liabilities following progress of reviews by tax authorities and administrative\n\n## 31 Statutory and other information\n\nappeal processes. The liability includes tax liabilities in respect of uncertain tax treatments which are estimated using the most likely amount method and the expected value method and depend on AstraZeneca's assessment of the likelihood of the approach taken by the tax authorities. This could change in the future to reflect progress in tax authority reviews, the extent that any tax authority challenge is concluded, or matters lapse including following expiry of the relevant statutes of limitation resulting in a reduction in the tax charge in future periods.\n\nFor these other tax liabilities in respect of uncertain tax treatments, AstraZeneca estimates the potential for additional liabilities above the amount provided where the possibility of the additional liabilities falling due is more than remote, to be up to $293m (2022: $209m; 2021: $273m) including associated interest. It is possible that some of these liabilities may reduce in the future if any tax authority challenge is concluded or matters lapse following expiry of the relevant statutes of limitation, resulting\n\nin a reduction in the tax charge in future periods. AstraZeneca does not believe there are any significant other uncertain tax treatments where the possibility of the additional liabilities falling due is more than remote (2022: $280m; 2021: $325m) including associated interest.\n\n## Timing of cash flows and interest\n\nThe Group is currently under audit in several countries and the timing of any resolution of these audits is uncertain.\n\nIt is anticipated that tax payments may be required in relation to a number of significant disputes which may be resolved over the next one to two years. AstraZeneca considers the tax liabilities set out above to appropriately reflect the expected value of any final settlement. Some of the items discussed above are not currently within the scope of tax authority audits and may take longer to resolve.\n\nIncluded within other payables is a net amount of interest arising on tax contingencies of $184m (2022: $106m; 2021: $85m).\n\n|                                                                                              | 2023 $m   | 2022 $m   | 2021 $m   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| Fees payable to PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP and its associates:                               |           |           |           |\n| Group audit fee                                                                              | 10.2      | 9.9       | 10.5      |\n| Fees payable to PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP and its associates for other services:            |           |           |           |\n| The audit of subsidiaries pursuant to legislation                                            | 15.0      | 15.1      | 15.2      |\n| Attestation under s404 of Sarbanes-Oxley Act 2002                                            | 3.3       | 3.1       | 2.0       |\n| Audit-related assurance services                                                             | 1.1       | 0.7       | 4.5       |\n| Other assurance services                                                                     | 0.2       | 0.2       | 3.4       |\n| Fees payable to PricewaterhouseCoopers Associates in respect of the Group's pension schemes: |           |           |           |\n| The audit of subsidiaries' pension schemes                                                   | 0.3       | 0.3       | 0.3       |\n|                                                                                              | 30.1      | 29.3      | 35.9      |\n\n$0.7m of fees payable in 2023 are in respect of the Group audit and audit of subsidiaries related to prior years (2022: $0.6m in respect of the Group audit and audit of subsidiaries related to prior years).\n\n$0.3m of 2021 Group audit fees and $0.7m of 2021 Audit-related assurance services and Other assurance services relate to pre-acquisition fees incurred by Alexion.\n\nIncluded in the 2021 Audit-related assurance services and Other assurance services are $6.1m of services provided in relation to the acquisition of Alexion and related debt issuance.\n\n## Related party transactions\n\nThe Group had no material related party transactions which might reasonably be expected to influence decisions made by the users of these Financial Statements.\n\n## Key management personnel compensation\n\nKey management personnel are defined for the purpose of disclosure under IAS 24 'Related Party Disclosures' as the members of the Board and the members of the SET.\n\n|                              | 2023 $'000   | 2022 $'000   | 2021 $'000   |\n|------------------------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Short-term employee benefits | 38,636       | 38,632       | 32,985       |\n| Post-employment benefits     | 1,354        | 1,388        | 1,378        |\n| Share-based payments         | 58,242       | 56,297       | 45,234       |\n|                              | 98,232       | 96,317       | 79,597       |\n\nTotal remuneration is included within employee costs (see Note 29).\n\n## 32 Subsequent events\n\nThere were no material subsequent events.",

The registered address is 1 Francis Crick Avenue, Cambridge Biomedical Campus, Cambridge, CB2 0AA.\n\nThese financial statements were prepared in accordance with FRS 101 'Reduced Disclosure Framework'.\n\nIn preparing these financial statements, the Company applied the recognition, measurement and disclosure requirements of International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the UK (UK-adopted international accounting standards), but made amendments where necessary in order to comply with the Companies Act 2006 and to take advantage of FRS 101 disclosure exemptions.\n\nIn these financial statements, the Company has applied the exemptions available under FRS 101 in respect of the following disclosures:\n\n- >  Statement of Cash Flows and related notes\n- >  disclosures in respect of transactions with wholly owned subsidiaries\n- >  disclosures in respect of capital management\n- >  the effects of new but not yet effective IFRSs\n- >  disclosures in respect of the compensation of Key Management Personnel.\n\nAs the Group Financial Statements (presented on pages 148 to 210) include the equivalent disclosures, the Company has also taken the exemptions under FRS 101 available in respect of the following disclosures:\n\n- >  IFRS 2 'Share-based Payment' in respect of Group settled share-based payments\n- >  certain disclosures required by IFRS 13 'Fair Value Measurement' and the disclosures required by IFRS 7 'Financial Instruments: Disclosures'.\n\nNo individual profit and loss account is prepared as provided by section 408 of the Companies Act 2006.\n\n## Basis of accounting\n\nThe Company Financial Statements are prepared under the historical cost convention and on a going concern basis, in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.\n\nThe following paragraphs describe the main accounting policies, which have been applied consistently.\n\n## Estimates and judgements\n\nThe preparation of the Company Financial Statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and judgements that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the Financial Statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. There are no key judgements or significant estimates.\n\n## Foreign currencies\n\nForeign currency transactions, being transactions denominated in a currency other than the Company's functional currency, are translated into US dollars at average rates for the relevant monthly accounting periods, which approximate to actual rates.\n\nMonetary assets and liabilities arising from foreign currency transactions are retranslated at exchange rates prevailing at the reporting date. Exchange gains and losses on loans and on short-term foreign currency borrowings and deposits are included within Finance expense. Exchange differences on all other foreign currency transactions are recognised in Operating profit.\n\nNon-monetary items arising from foreign currency transactions are not retranslated in the Company's accounting records.\n\n## Taxation\n\nThe current tax payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from reported profit because taxable profit excludes items that are either never taxable or tax deductible or items that are taxable or tax deductible in a different period. The Company's current tax assets and liabilities are calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date.\n\nDeferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. Deferred tax liabilities are recognised unless they arise from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit. Deferred tax liabilities are not recognised to the extent they arise from the initial recognition of non-tax deductible goodwill. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that there are future taxable temporary differences or it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the asset can be utilised. This requires judgements to be made in respect of the availability of future taxable income.\n\nNo deferred tax asset or liability is recognised in respect of temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries and branches where the Company is able to control the timing of reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.\n\nThe Company's deferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated using tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset realised based on tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date.\n\nLiabilities for uncertain tax positions require management to make judgements of potential exposures in relation to tax audit issues. Tax benefits are not recognised unless the tax positions will probably be accepted by the tax authorities. This is based upon management's interpretation of applicable laws and regulations and the expectation of how the tax authority will resolve the matter. Once considered probable of not being accepted, management reviews each material tax benefit and reflects the effect of the uncertainty in determining the related taxable result.\n\nLiabilities for uncertain tax positions are measured using either the most likely amount or the expected value amount depending on which method the Company expects to better predict the resolution of the uncertainty.\n\nThe Company has applied the exemption under the IAS 12 'Income Taxes' amendment for recognising and disclosing information about deferred tax assets and liabilities related to top-up income taxes.\n\n## Investments\n\nFixed asset investments, including investments in subsidiaries, are stated at cost and reviewed for impairment if there are indications that the carrying value may not be recoverable.\n\n## Debtors\n\nAmounts owed by Group undertakings are recognised initially at fair value. Subsequent to initial recognition they are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment losses.\n\nThe recoverability of these balances has been assessed in accordance with IFRS 9 and no impairment has been identified. The amounts owed by Group undertakings are considered to have low credit risk, due to timely payment of interest and settlement of principal amount on agreed due dates, limiting the loss allowance to 12-month expected credit losses.",

        "page_content": "Amounts owed by Group undertakings are written off where there is no reasonable expectation of recovery. Impairment losses are presented as net impairment losses within Operating profit, any subsequent recoveries are credited against the same line.\n\n## Other payables\n\nLiabilities included in Other payables are recognised initially at fair value. Subsequent to initial recognition they are remeasured at either amortised cost using the effective interest method or at fair value using an expected credit loss model.\n\n## Financial instruments\n\nInterest-bearing loans are initially measured at fair value (with direct transaction costs being amortised over the life of the loan) and are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method at each reporting date. Changes in carrying value are recognised in profit.\n\n## Share-based payments\n\nThe issuance by the Company to employees of its subsidiaries of a grant of awards over the Company's shares, represents additional capital contributions by the Company to its subsidiaries. An additional investment in subsidiaries results in a corresponding increase in shareholders' equity. The additional capital contribution is based on the fair value of the grant issued, allocated over the underlying grant's vesting period, less the market cost of shares charged to subsidiaries in settlement of such share awards.\n\n## Litigation\n\nThrough the normal course of business, the AstraZeneca Group is involved in legal disputes, the settlement of which may involve cost to the Company. A provision is made where an adverse outcome is probable and associated costs, including related legal costs, can be estimated reliably. In other cases, appropriate disclosures are included.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Each series of AstraZeneca Finance Notes has been fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the Company.

The AstraZeneca Finance Notes are structurally subordinated to indebtedness and other liabilities of the subsidiaries of AstraZeneca PLC, none of which guarantee the AstraZeneca Finance Notes.",

The Board has a formal system in place for Directors to declare such situations to be considered for authorisation by those Directors who have no interest in the matter being considered.\n\nIn deciding whether to authorise a situation, the non-con/flicted Directors must act in the way they consider, in good faith, would be most likely to promote the success of the Company, and they may impose limits or conditions when giving the authorisation, or subsequently, if they think this is appropriate. Situations considered by the Board and authorisations given are recorded in the Board minutes and in a register of con/flicts maintained by the Company Secretary and are reviewed annually by the Board. The Board believes that this system operates effectively.\n\n## Shareholder fraud warning\n\nShareholders of AstraZeneca and many other companies have reported receiving unsolicited calls and correspondence relating to their shareholdings and investment matters. Shareholders are advised to be very cautious of any unsolicited approaches and to note that reputable /firms authorised by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) are very unlikely to make such approaches. Such approaches are likely to be part of a 'boiler room scam' attempting to defraud shareholders.\n\nShareholders are advised to familiarise themselves with the information on scams available on the FCA website, www.fca.org.uk/consumers and within the FAQs in the Investors section of our website, www.astrazeneca.com.\n\nAny suspected scams or fraudulent approaches should be reported to the FCA via its website and to AstraZeneca's Ordinary Share registrar, using the contact details on this page.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor further information on dividends declared, see the Shareholder information section of our website, www.astrazeneca.com.",

The Group's subsidiaries and their locations are set out in Group Subsidiaries and Holdings in the Financial Statements from page 211.\n\n## Branches and countries in which the Group conducts business\n\nIn accordance with the Companies Act 2006, we disclose below countries of our representative, scienti/fic or branch of/fices outside the UK established through various subsidiaries of the Company:\n\nAlgeria, Angola, Costa Rica, Cuba, Denmark, Egypt, Georgia, Ghana, Jordan, Lebanon, Norway, Portugal, Romania, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Syria, Ukraine, United Arab Emirates, the US and Vietnam.\n\n## Disclosure of information to auditors\n\nThe Directors who held of/fice at the date of approval of this Annual Report con/firm that, so far as they are each aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the Company's auditors are unaware; and each Director has taken all the steps that he or she ought to have taken as a Director to make himself or herself aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the Company's auditors are aware of that information.\n\n## Going concern accounting basis\n\nInformation on the business environment in which AstraZeneca operates, including the factors underpinning the industry's future growth prospects, is included in the Strategic Report. Details of the product portfolio of the Group are contained in the Strategic Report (in the Therapy Area Review from page 16). For information on patent expiry dates for key marketed products, see the Patent Expiries of Key Marketed Products Supplement on our website, www.astrazeneca.com/ annualreport2023. Our approach to product development is covered in detail with additional information by Therapy Area in the Strategic Report.

In addition, Note 28 to the Financial Statements from page 195 includes the Group's objectives, policies and processes for: managing capital; /financial risk management objectives; details of its /financial instruments and hedging activities; and its exposures to credit, market and liquidity risk. Further details of the Group's cash balances and borrowings are included in Notes 17 and 19 to the Financial Statements from page 178.\n\nHaving assessed the Principal Risks and other matters considered in connection with the Viability statement on page 55, the Board considers it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the Annual Report and Financial Statements.\n\n## Shares\n\nA shareholders' resolution was passed at the 2023 AGM authorising the Company to purchase its own shares. The Company did not purchase any of its own shares in 2023. On 31 December 2023, the Company did not hold any shares in treasury.\n\n## Rights, preferences and restrictions attaching to shares\n\nAs at 31 December 2023, the Company had 1,550,162,626 Ordinary Shares and 50,000 Redeemable Preference Shares in issue. The Ordinary Shares represent 99.98% and the Redeemable Preference Shares represent 0.02% of the Company's total share capital (these percentages have been calculated by reference to the 8am WM/Reuters USD/GBP exchange rate on 29 December 2023).\n\nAs agreed by the shareholders at the Company's AGM held on 29 April 2010, the Articles were amended with immediate effect to remove the requirement for the Company to have an authorised share capital, the concept of which was abolished under the Companies Act 2006. Each Ordinary Share carries the right to vote at general meetings of the Company. The rights and restrictions attaching to the Redeemable Preference Shares differ from those attaching to Ordinary Shares as follows:\n\n- > The Redeemable Preference Shares carry no rights to receive dividends.\n- > The holders of Redeemable Preference Shares have no rights to receive notices of, attend or vote at general meetings except in certain limited circumstances. They have one vote for every 50,000 Redeemable Preference Shares held.\n- > On a distribution of assets of the Company, on a winding-up or other return of capital (subject to certain exceptions), the holders of Redeemable Preference Shares have priority over the holders of Ordinary Shares to receive the capital paid up on those shares.\n\n- > Subject to the provisions of the Companies Act 2006, the Company has the right to redeem the Redeemable Preference Shares at any time on giving not less than seven days' written notice.\n\nThere are no speci/fic restrictions on the transfer of shares in the Company, which is governed by the Articles and prevailing legislation.\n\nThe Company is not aware of any agreements between holders of shares that may result in restrictions on the transfer of shares or that may result in restrictions on voting rights. The Company is also not aware of any arrangements under which /financial rights are held by a person other than the holder of the shares.\n\n## Action necessary to change the rights of shareholders\n\nIn order to vary the rights attached to any class of shares, the consent in writing of the holders of three quarters in nominal value of the issued shares of that class or the sanction of a special resolution passed at a general meeting of such holders is required.\n\n## Changes in share capital\n\nChanges in the Company's Ordinary Share capital during 2023, including details of the allotment of new shares under the Company's share plans, are given in Note 24 to the Financial Statements from page 192.\n\n## Employee share trust ownership rights\n\nThe trustee of the AstraZeneca Employee Bene/fit Trust (the EBT, the Trustee) will not exercise voting rights attached to shares held in the EBT (Shares). Any decision as to acceptance or rejection of an offer for Shares subject to subsisting awards would be made by the Trustee, having regard to the interests of award holders.\n\nDuring 2023, a further employee bene/fit trust was established for the bene/fit of employees based in Canada (the Canada EBT). The trustees of the Canada EBT will not exercise voting rights attached to shares held in the Canada EBT.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information on shares, see Issued share capital, shareholdings and share prices on page 226.",

No changes to major shareholdings were disclosed to the Company between 31 December 2023 and 31 January 2024.\n\nSo far as the Company is aware, it is neither directly nor indirectly owned or controlled by one or more corporations or by any government.\n\nThe Company does not know of any arrangements, the operation of which might result in a change in the control of the Company.\n\n## Directors', officers' and SET shareholdings\n\nAt 31 January 2024, the total amount of the Company's voting securities owned by Directors and of/ficers of the Company and other SET members was:\n\n| Title of class   | Amount   owned   | Percentage  of class   |\n|------------------|------------------|------------------------|\n| Ordinary Shares  | 804,434          | 0.05%                  |\n\n## Options to purchase securities from registrant or subsidiaries\n\n(a) At 31 January 2024, options outstanding to subscribe for Ordinary Shares were:\n\n| Number of shares   | Subscription  price (pence)   | Normal expiry date   |\n|--------------------|-------------------------------|----------------------|\n| 1,176,592          | 3597-9064                     | 2023-2029            |\n\nThe weighted average subscription price of options outstanding at 31 January 2024 was 7086 pence. All options were granted under Company employee share schemes.\n\n(b) None of the options included in paragraph (a) have been granted to of/ficers of the Company and SET members.\n\n(c) During 2023, no options were held by Directors.\n\nDuring the period 1 January 2024 to 31 January 2024, no Director was granted or exercised any options.\n\n## Distributions to shareholders dividends for 2023\n\nDetails of our distribution policy are set out in the Financial Review from page 58 and Note 28 to the Financial Statements from page 195.\n\nThe Company's dividend for 2023 of $2.90 (227.8 pence, 30.29 SEK) per Ordinary Share is estimated to amount to, in aggregate, a total dividend payment to shareholders of $4,494 million. Two employee share trusts, AstraZeneca EBT and AstraZeneca Share Trust Limited, waived their rights to a dividend on the Ordinary Shares they hold and instead received nominal dividends.\n\n## Articles of Association\n\nAstraZeneca PLC's current Articles were adopted by shareholders at the Company's AGM held on 27 April 2023. Any amendment to the Articles requires the approval of shareholders by a special resolution at a general meeting of the Company.\n\n## Objects\n\nThe Company's objects are unrestricted.\n\n## Directors\n\nThe Board has the authority to manage the business of the Company, for example, through powers to allot and repurchase its shares, subject where required to shareholder resolutions. Subject to certain exceptions, Directors do not have power to vote at Board meetings on matters in which they have a material interest.\n\nThe quorum for meetings of the Board is a majority of the full Board, of whom at least four must be Non-Executive Directors. In the absence of a quorum, the Directors do not\n\nhave power to determine compensation arrangements for themselves or any member of the Board.\n\nThe Board may exercise all the powers of the Company to borrow money. Variation of these borrowing powers would require the passing of a special resolution of the Company's shareholders.\n\nAll Directors must retire from of/fice at the Company's AGM each year and may present themselves for election or re-election. Directors are not prohibited, upon reaching a particular age, from submitting themselves for election or re-election.\n\n## General meetings\n\nAGMs require 21 clear days' notice to shareholders. Subject to the Companies Act 2006, other general meetings require 14 clear days' notice.\n\nFor all general meetings, a quorum of two shareholders present in person or by proxy, and entitled to vote on the business transacted, is required unless each of the two persons present is a corporate representative of the same corporation, or each of the two persons present is a proxy of the same shareholder.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information on dividend distribution, the AGM and results announcements, see Financial calendar on page 225.\n\nFor more information on the Directors, see Board of Directors on pages 78 and 79.",

This includes engagement with our employees, suppliers and other stakeholders, as well as the impact of our operations on the community and environment.\n\nInformation on how we encourage employee involvement in the Company's performance is set out in People and Sustainability from page 43. Details of some of the employee share plans are described in the Directors' Remuneration Report from page 102, and in Note 29 to the Financial Statements from page 201. All employees are provided with information on matters of concern to them through regular meetings and updates on the Group's intranet and internal social media. 'Townhall' meetings and Q&A sessions are hosted regularly by members of senior management, including the SET, including global and targeted broadcasts on internal social media. During 2023, these broadcasts provided updates on the business, including pipeline developments and leadership changes, as well as the Group's response to global issues such as climate change. In addition, information about the Group's quarterly results is shared with employees. These updates inform employees of the /financial and economic factors which affect the performance of the Group.\n\n## Political donations\n\nNeither the Company nor its subsidiaries made any EU political donations or incurred any EU political expenditure in 2023 and they do not intend to do so in the future in respect of which shareholder authority is required, or for which disclosure in this Annual Report is required, under the Companies Act 2006. However, to enable the Company and its subsidiaries to continue to support interest groups or lobbying organisations concerned with the review of government policy or law reform without inadvertently breaching the Companies Act 2006, which de/fines political donations and other political expenditure in broad terms, a resolution will be put to shareholders at the 2024 AGM, similar to that passed at the 2023 AGM, to authorise the Company and its subsidiaries to:\n\n- > make donations to political parties or independent election candidates\n- > make donations to political organisations other than political parties\n- > incur political expenditure, up to an aggregate limit of $250,000.\n\nCorporate political contributions in the US are permitted in de/fined circumstances under the First Amendment of the US Constitution and are subject to both federal and state laws and regulations. In 2023, the Group's US legal entities made contributions amounting in aggregate to $1,687,650 (2022: $1,316,950) to national political organisations, state-level political party committees and to campaign committees of various state candidates. No corporate political donations were made at the federal level and all contributions were made only where allowed by US federal and state law. We publicly disclose details of our corporate US political contributions, which can be found on our website, www.astrazeneca-us.com/sustainability/ corporate-transparency.\n\nThe annual corporate contributions budget is reviewed and approved by the US Vice-President, Corporate Affairs and the President of our US business to ensure robust governance and oversight. US citizens or individuals holding valid green cards exercised decision making over the contributions and the funds were not provided or reimbursed by any non-US legal entity. Such contributions do not constitute political donations or political expenditure for the purposes of the Companies Act 2006 and were made without any involvement of persons or entities outside the US.\n\n## Significant agreements\n\nThere are no signi/ficant agreements to which the Company is a party that take effect, alter or terminate on a change of control of the Company following a takeover bid. There are no persons with whom we have contractual or other arrangements, who are deemed by the Directors to be essential to our business.\n\n## Use of financial instruments\n\nThe Notes to the Financial Statements, including Note 28 from page 195, include further information on our use of /financial instruments.\n\n## Insurance and indemnities\n\nThe Company maintained directors' and of/ficers' liability insurance cover throughout 2023. The Directors are also able to obtain independent legal advice at the expense of the Company, as necessary, in their capacity as Directors.\n\nThe Company has entered into a deed of indemnity in favour of each Board member since 2006. These deeds of indemnity are still in force and provide that the Company shall indemnify the Directors to the fullest extent permitted by law and the Articles, in respect of all losses arising out of, or in connection with, the execution of their powers, duties and responsibilities as Directors of the Company or any of its subsidiaries. This is in line with current market practice and helps us attract and retain high-quality, skilled Directors.\n\n## Compliance requirements under Listing Rule 9.8.4\n\nThe only matter to report is the shareholder waiver of dividends on page 228.\n\n## Directors' Report\n\nThe Directors' Report, which has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006, comprises the following sections:\n\n- > Chair's Statement\n- > Chief Executive Of/ficer's Review\n- > Therapy Area Review\n- > Business Review\n- > Risk Overview\n- > Financial Review: Financial risk management\n- > Corporate Governance: including the Corporate Governance Overview, Corporate Governance Report, Nomination and Governance Committee Report, Science Committee Report, Sustainability Committee Report and Audit Committee Report\n- > Directors' responsibility statement\n- > Shareholder information\n- > Sustainability supplementary information\n\nand has been approved by the Board and signed on its behalf.\n\nOn behalf of the Board\n\n## A C N Kemp\n\nCompany Secretary 8 February 2024",

The forward-looking statements reflect knowledge and information available at the date of the preparation of this Annual Report and the Company undertakes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements. We identify the forward-looking statements by using the words 'anticipates', 'believes', 'expects', 'intends' and similar expressions in such statements. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in forward-looking statements, certain of which are beyond our control, include, among other things:\n\n- > the ability of the Group and Icosavax to complete the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement with Icosavax, including the parties' ability to satisfy the conditions to the consummation of the tender offer contemplated thereby and the other conditions set forth in the merger agreement with Icosavax\n- > the ability of the Group and Gracell to complete the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement with Gracell, including the parties' ability to satisfy the conditions set forth in the merger agreement with Gracell\n- > the Group's statements about the expected timetable for completing the acquisitions of Icosavax and Gracell\n- > The Group's and Icosavax's beliefs and expectations and statements about the benefits sought to be achieved in the Group's pending acquisition of Icosavax\n- > the Group's and Gracell's beliefs and\n\n- expectations and statements about the benefits sought to be achieved in the Group's proposed acquisition of Gracell\n- > the potential effects of the acquisition of Icosavax on both the Group and Icosavax and of the acquisition of Gracell on both the Group and Gracell\n- > the possibility of any termination of the merger agreement with Icosavax or of the merger agreement with Gracell\n- > the expected benefits and success of IVX-A12 and any combination product or GC012F and any combination product\n- > the possibility that any milestone related to any contingent value right will not be achieved the risk of failure or delay in delivery of pipeline or launch of new medicines\n- > the risk of failure to meet regulatory or ethical requirements for medicine development or approval\n- > the risk of failures or delays in the quality or execution of the Group's commercial strategies\n- > the risk of pricing, affordability, access and competitive pressures\n- > the risk of failure to maintain supply of compliant, quality medicines\n- > the risk of illegal trade in our Group's medicines\n- > the impact of reliance on third-party goods and services\n- > the risk of failure in IT or cybersecurity\n- > the risk of failure of critical processes\n- > the risk of failure to collect and manage data in line with legal and regulatory requirements and strategic objectives\n- > the risk of failure to attract, develop, engage and retain a diverse, talented and capable workforce\n- > the risk of failure to meet regulatory or ethical expectations on environmental impact, including climate change\n- > the risk of the safety and efficacy of marketed medicines being questioned\n- > the risk of adverse outcome of litigation and/or governmental investigations\n- > intellectual property-related risks to the Group's products\n- > the risk of failure to achieve strategic plans or meet targets or expectations\n- > the risk of failure in financial control or the occurrence of fraud\n- > the impact that global and/or geopolitical events may have or continue to have on these risks, on the Group's ability to continue to mitigate these risks, and on the Group's operations, financial results or financial condition\n- > the risk of failure in financial control or the occurrence of fraud\n- > the risk of unexpected deterioration in the Group's financial position.\n\nCertain of these factors are discussed in more detail, without limitation, in the Risk Supplement available on our website, www.astrazeneca.com/annualreport2023, and reproduced in AstraZeneca's Form 20-F filing for 2023, available on the SEC website www.sec.gov. Nothing in this Annual Report should be construed as a profit forecast.\n\n## Inclusion of Reported performance, Core financial measures and constant exchange rate growth rates\n\nAstraZeneca's determination of non-GAAP measures, together with our presentation of them within our financial information, may differ from similarly titled non-GAAP measures of other companies.\n\n## Statements of competitive position, growth rates and sales\n\nIn this Annual Report, except as otherwise stated, market information regarding the position of our business or products relative to its or their competition is based upon published statistical sales data for the 12 months ended 30 September 2023 obtained from IQVIA, a leading supplier of statistical data to the pharmaceutical industry. Unless otherwise noted, for the US, dispensed new or total prescription data and audited sales data are taken, respectively, from IQVIA National Prescription Audit and IQVIA National Sales Perspectives for the 12 months ended 31 December 2023; such data are not adjusted for Medicaid and similar rebates. Except as otherwise stated, these market share and industry data from IQVIA have been derived by comparing our sales revenue with competitors' and total market sales revenues for that period, and except as otherwise stated, growth rates are given at CER.\n\nFor the purposes of this Annual Report, unless otherwise stated, references to the world pharmaceutical market or similar phrases are to the 55 countries contained in the IQVIA database, which amounted to approximately 94% (in value) of the countries audited by IQVIA. Changes in data subscriptions, exchange rates and subscription coverage, as well as restated IQVIA data, have led to the restatement of total market values for prior years.\n\n## AstraZeneca websites\n\nInformation on or accessible through our websites, including www.astrazeneca.com, and www.astrazenecaclinicaltrials.com and on any websites referenced in this Annual Report, does not form part of and is not incorporated into this Annual Report.\n\n## External/third-party websites\n\nInformation on or accessible through any third-party or external website does not form part of and is not incorporated into this Annual Report.\n\n## Figures\n\nFigures in parentheses in tables and in the Financial Statements are used to represent negative numbers.\n\n## Supplements\n\nFor detailed information on our Development Pipeline, Patent Expiries of Key Marketed Products, Risk, and Task Force on Climaterelated Financial Disclosures (TCFD) Statement, see our website,\n\nwww.astrazeneca.com/annualreport2023.",
