In broadband, we restored our market leading network quality position. This was reflected in four major independent network test results from Connect, CHIP, Computer BILD and nPerf where we achieved leading quality and reliability scores. Reflecting inflationary pressure, we have increased the price of our broadband packages. As expected, this impacted our commercial performance with our broadband customer base declining by 392,000 during the year. Our converged customer base increased by 99,000 to 2.4 million.\n\nAhead of changes to German TV laws, which take effect from July 2024 and change the practice of bulk TV contracting in MDUs, we have started migrating end users to new contracts at scale. Based on our experience to date, we expect to retain around 50% of the 8.5 million MDU TV households. At the end of March 2024, we had already actively retained 1.9 million households. Our total TV customer base declined by 1.0 million during the year, primarily due to the MDU transition, which began in the last quarter of FY24.\n\nWe added 239,000 new mobile contract customers in FY24, supported by our new propositions, the ongoing optimisation of sales channels and an improved performance of Vodafone's own brands. We also added 8.0 million IoT connections, driven by continued strong demand from the automotive sector. During the year, we agreed a long-term national roaming partnership with 1&1. We expect to deliver mobile coverage nationwide to 1&1's customers from the second half of the 2024 calendar year. Our fibre-to-the-home ('FTTH') joint venture, OXG Glasfaser, started its network rollout during the year, initially in Neuss, D\u00fcsseldorf, Marburg and Kassel. OXG Glasfaser will deploy FTTH to up to seven million homes over a six-year period and is complementary to our upgrade plans for our existing hybrid fibre cable network.",

Vodafone is a member of JAC, a telecommunications industry organisation that promotes a consistent and simplified approach to engaging suppliers and supporting the transition of our industry towards net zero. Following its launch, our banking partners also continue to roll out an environmental supply chain finance programme, which offers financial incentives for our suppliers to disclose carbon data to CDP and take action to improve their environmental performance over time.

Cyber security training is mandatory as part of our Doing What's Right programme. The training module is designed by the cyber security team to inform employees of key threats and how to avoid them. The cyber leadership team are actively involved in shaping the approach and in specific employee communication. The corporate security function lead on all employee security training and they deliver the programme and materials. Mandatory training runs every other year with a short refresher and knowledge check in the intermediate year. If the knowledge check is failed, the employees are required to retake the full cyber security training module. During the year we launched a training manual for contractors, so they also receive the same level of awareness. Training on cyber security is also included in our induction process for new employees. We track completion rates to ensure every employee completes mandatory training when assigned.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRead more about our approach to mandatory\n\nDoing What's Right training on page 44\n\nCyber security training is reinforced by regular digital communications delivered via our internal social media platform, through videos and webinars. We respond to threats with specific targeted advice, such as the use of multi-factor authentication and reminders to not share credentials.\n\nWe perform phishing simulations across all markets and functions to raise awareness and train employees. We target at least two exercises per market or function per year. We also run multi-market simulations to allow us to compare responses consistently - in the most recent exercise we sent over 100,000 1 emails to nine 1 European markets and Group functions. Those who click on the link in the phishing message or share their credentials receive immediate training. We are now rolling out this multi-market approach to our African markets.\n\nWe also provided focused training for our Executive Committee. This year, we covered social engineering threats, use of social media, travel to high-risk countries, using devices securely and how to share confidential information safely. The training materials were cascaded to their teams by ExCo members.\n\nWe have continued to undertake incident simulations for local executive committees, most recently for Greece. The simulations provide CEOs and their teams a realistic and tailored experience of managing a cyber incident and exercising their responsibilities in accordance with our common approach.\n\n## Growing our skills\n\nWe enable employees in our cyber teams to maintain and grow their skills to better protect our customers. Our company learning platform hosts cyber training on technical topics, platforms and frameworks. Employees can study towards recognised information security and cyber certifications aligned to their learning plans.\n\nSince 2020 we have organised twice yearly cyber connect events for our entire global cyber security team. The events include a recap of our strategy and achievements, messages from senior leadership, external industry speakers, collaborative breakout groups and technical track sessions to learn about cyber topics and best practice. We use technology to enable a hybrid experience with some attending in offices and some remote.\n\nRead more about the Audit and Risk Committee's oversight of cyber security on pages 89 to 94\n\n## The Cyber Code\n\nThe Vodafone Cyber Code has been designed to simplify and explain basic security controls and procedures to all employees. The Cyber Code is embedded in our Code of Conduct and is the cornerstone of how we expect all employees to behave when it comes to best practice in cyber security. It consists of seven areas where employees must follow good security practice.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nClick to read more about Vodafone's Cyber Code in our Code of Conduct: vodafone.com/code-of-conduct\n\n## Threats and incidents\n\n## Threat landscape and intelligence\n\nAn important part of our operating model is to gather intelligence and insights about threats. The cyber threat landscape continues to be volatile across all sectors, with wide-ranging threat actors. Our cyber security team use industry and external analysis to help shape our controls and procedures, and drive actions. When specific vendor or new high impact vulnerabilities are reported, we drive global remediation across Vodafone.\n\nGeopolitical instability, conflict and tensions often lead to an increase in cyber threats from state-backed and criminal threat actors. This can lead to disruption, data theft and integrity compromise. Cross-industry and government collaboration is vital.\n\nRansomware and data extortion attacks are common to companies of all sizes. The threat is increasing. Based on public reporting, some companies are paying ransoms, aggravating the threat.\n\nAttackers are increasingly trying to log in, rather than hack in. As such, social engineering methods are a common means for attackers to gain access. Emerging technologies such as AI will enhance techniques such as voice phishing and deep fakes. Harvested credentials continue to be sought and shared by threat actors. Attackers can target executives following media announcements and public reporting.\n\nThe speed of vulnerability exploitation is very fast, with a trend for targeting internet-facing software.\n\nIn 2023, the European Commission highlighted the number of supply chain attacks in Europe has tripled. Supplier attacks against all sectors are likely to increase in the coming year.\n\nWe anticipate threats will continue from existing sources, as well as evolving in new technology areas such as AI and quantum computing.\n\n## Cyber operations and incidents\n\nAs a global connectivity provider, we see a range of cyber threats. We use our layers of controls to identify, block and mitigate threats and reduce business or customer impact. Our global security operations capability handles trillions of events and logs from sensors across our footprint, detecting potential threats and events. Low severity issues are dealt with quickly, for example by malware containment or isolating an individual device. More significant events are triaged to our 24/7 incident management and response team. We operate a single global team and capability.\n\nWhere a security incident occurs, we have a consistent incident management framework to manage our response and recovery. The focus of our incident responders is always fast risk mitigation and customer security.\n\nIn the event of a cyber breach, disclosure is made to the relevant authorities in line with local and global regulations and laws and a risk assessment considering the impact on customers. This may include law enforcement as well as regulators. The European Union's GDPR provides a framework for notifying customers in the event there is a loss of customer data because of a data breach, and this framework is a baseline across all our markets. Our data privacy officers are a key part of the response where incidents impact personal data. We will also notify the SEC if an incident is deemed material.\n\nNote:",

        "page_content": "We classify security incidents on a scale according to severity, measured by potential business and customer impact. The highest severity category of event is called Severity 0 down to the lowest Severity 4. Severity 0 corresponds to a significant data breach or loss of service caused by the incident. If a Severity 0 incident occurs, we notify the Executive Committee, the Board and external auditors and provide regular updates. A crisis group is formed composed of relevant senior management who oversee the response.\n\nSEC requirements have been incorporated into our incident management process. In the event of a Severity 0 incident, the Disclosure Committee (composed of the CFO and General Counsel) would decide if a UK market disclosure is necessary for materiality reasons, that would also trigger disclosure to the SEC.\n\nIn the past two financial years, no incidents have been Severity 0. In FY22 we experienced one Severity 0 in Vodafone Portugal in February 2022 and in FY21 we experienced one Severity 0 incident at Italy Ho. Mobile in December 2020. Details of these two previous disclosures are in our FY23 Cyber Security Factsheet. These incidents did not have a material impact on the Company's business strategy, results of operations or financial condition.\n\nWhilst overall incident volumes have remained stable, a higher proportion of these are at suppliers and third parties. In FY24, 55% of severity 1 and 2 incidents were related to our suppliers and third parties (FY23; 47%). We contractually require our suppliers to report incidents and we track and manage the incidents using the same framework as we do for internal events. In two cases in this financial year, our team helped a supplier recover services after a ransomware attack. Neither of these incidents were material to Vodafone's business strategy, results of operations or financial condition.\n\nWhen incidents are closed, we complete a post-incident review to learn the lessons from the incident, including the root cause and any improvements needed.\n\nCyber insurance is an important part of our risk management and mitigation approach. Vodafone holds cyber liability insurance alongside business interruption and professional indemnity policies. Should a serious cyber event occur, we could recover the costs in whole or in part through these policies.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nClick to read more about how we manage risks from technology disruptions in our SASB disclosure: investors.vodafone.com/sasb\n\n## Society\n\n## Protecting people\n\nWherever we operate, we have an opportunity to contribute to the advancement of fundamental rights for our customers, colleagues and communities. We are also conscious of the risks associated with our operations, and we work hard to mitigate negative impacts, ensuring we keep people safe.\n\n## Mobiles, masts and health\n\nThe health and safety of our customers and the wider public has always been, and continues to be, a priority for us. Our masts fully comply with national regulations, which are typically based on, or go beyond, international guidelines set by the independent scientific body, the International Commission for Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection ('ICNIRP'). There has been scientific research on mobile frequencies for decades, including those used by 5G. If exposure is within national regulations, the scientific consensus is that there is no adverse impact on health. We continually monitor and evaluate our mobile networks to make sure we meet all regulations. In addition, all the products we sell are rigorously evaluated to ensure they comply with international safety guidelines.\n\nAs well as complying with national regulations, markets that have rolled out 5G apply the Smart PowerLock ('SPL') feature. This technology, designed for use with the adaptive antennas used for 5G, continuously monitors the transmitted radio frequency power of the antenna to ensure it is always below a threshold when averaged over a predefined time window. This takes into account compliance with electromagnetic field ('EMF') regulations under all possible operating conditions for 5G sites. This is now one of many software features that are routinely active on 5G sites. SPL also includes statistics that can be used to build evidence of compliance over several weeks for a given site if needed by regulators. National regulators have accepted the feature as effective.\n\n## Science monitoring\n\nScientific reviews have made a vital contribution to establishing industry guidelines and standards. We follow the results of these independent expert reviews to understand developments in scientific research related to mobile devices, base stations and health.\n\nWe continue to fund research into mobile devices, base stations and health through funding bodies such as national governments to ensure that the research remains independent of industry influence, including our own. We also respond to requests from bodies conducting research by providing technical advice and information on the use of mobile devices. This helps to ensure scientists have access to the best-quality information available.\n\nHarmonisation with international science-based guidelines Following the publication in 2020 of updated international guidelines on electromagnetic frequencies, we have supported and promoted the transition from the previous guidelines from 1998 to this more up-to-date and appropriate set. In EU Member States, the EMF regulations are set nationally with most being aligned with the ICNIRP guidelines. In the last year, in the city of Brussels, conditions have been changed to allow for the rollout of 5G services.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nClick to read more about ICNIRP 2020:\n\nicnirp.org\n\n## Operating model\n\nWe have robust governance mechanisms in place and conduct regular compliance assessments to ensure that our products meet the standards set by the Group policy and national regulations. The Group EMF leadership team meets through the year and reports to the Executive Committee and the Board.\n\nWe conduct network measurements and calculations of EMF exposure from network masts and review the test reports we receive on EMF testing on devices.\n\n## Human rights\n\nWe want to make sure that we have a positive impact on people and society, which includes respecting human rights in all our operations. We are a long-standing member of the UN Global Compact and our approach is guided by the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGPs).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nClick to read more about our human rights approach:\n\nvodafone.com/human-rights\n\nOur Human Rights Policy Statement details how we do this and is backed up by our internal Human Rights Policy, which sets out how our people must ensure we respect human rights, including steps to take through our other aligned policies, such as those covering artificial intelligence, ethical purchasing, responsible minerals, health and safety, human resources, privacy, business resilience and law enforcement assistance.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nClick to read our Human Rights Policy Statement: vodafone.com/human-rights-policy-statement",

This means that globally our most significant human rights risks relate to our customers' rights to privacy, concerning their data that we safeguard, and freedom of expression, in terms of their ability to receive, seek and share information, through the connections we provide. Local laws and regulations can mandate that telecommunications operators must assist governments, and we must comply with lawful government requests as part of our operating licences. This might include the disclosure of customer information or limiting access to digital networks and services. However, our internal law enforcement assistance policy guides us on how to do this in a rights-respecting way, and our transparency reporting provides data on certain requests we receive.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nClick to read more about how we handle law enforcement demands: vodafone.com/handling-law-enforcement-demands\n\nThe risks to people working throughout our supply chain are another area of focus for us. We manage these risks through our responsible supply chain programme, which assesses our suppliers for indicators such as forced labour and other risks to human rights, such as health and safety. As members of the Joint Alliance for CSR ('JAC'), we benefit from JAC-led on-site supplier audits and sharing of best practices with other telecommunications operators to enhance our supply chain management. We believe in supporting the responsible sourcing of minerals globally. Although we do not source minerals ourselves, we follow the best practice of the OECD Due Diligence Guidance to understand whether our manufactured products include minerals that have been sourced from smelters taking a responsible approach to sourcing.\n\nOur human rights programme also addresses a broader range of human rights risks, such as those relating to the design and deployment of artificial intelligence, children's rights, data ethics and risks we may become connected with through our broader value chain, such as enterprise customers or partner markets.\n\n## Our approach\n\nWe conduct due diligence in line with our internal policies to proactively identify and address potential negative human rights impacts. Due diligence comes in various forms and at different moments in our operations: it may be an independent human rights risk assessment for a new market entry, the ongoing assessments we do when considering new partner markets, roaming partnerships, the deployment of artificial intelligence or the development of new products and services.\n\nWe follow up assessments of actual or potential material negative human rights impacts with what we consider to be appropriate mitigating actions, such as contractual commitments to respect human rights in our partner market agreements and in our enterprise customer contracts.\n\nWe maintain a grievance mechanism 'Speak Up' accessible to all individuals in our workforce or supply chain, providing a platform to raise concerns about human rights issues.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nClick or scan to watch a video summarising our human rights approach:\n\ninvestors.vodafone.com/videos\n\nClick to read more about our Conflict Minerals Reports and Statement: vodafone.com/ responsibleminerals\n\n## Governance\n\nThe Chief External and Corporate Affairs Officer oversees our human rights programme and is a member of the Executive Committee. The Human Rights Manager, working closely with the Vodacom Group Human Rights Principal Specialist, manages our programme, and is supported by a cross-functional internal Human Rights Advisory Group, comprising senior managers responsible for privacy, security, responsible sourcing and diversity and inclusion, amongst others. We report regularly on our progress to the Purpose and Reputation Steering Committee, which assists the Executive Committee in fulfilling duties with regard to our purpose, reputation management and policy. This year, we concluded a review of our human rights impacts, governance and controls, which recognised Vodafone's\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFinancials\n\nOther information\n\nstrong support for a culture of respect for human rights while identifying actionable improvements, such as consolidating and simplifying our policy architecture and accountability structure and building and empowering our Human Rights Champions network. In FY24, we have updated our Human Rights policy and relaunched our Human Rights Champions network. In FY25, we will conduct a review of our Human Rights Advisory Group's terms of reference and membership structure with the aim to report on our progress.\n\n## Collaboration\n\nWe play our part in developing the global understanding of what businesses should do to respect human rights. We were placed second in the Ranking Digital Rights 2022 Telco Giants Scorecard, maintaining our position from the 2020 Index. We are a member of initiatives such as the GSMA Mobile Alliance to combat Digital Child Sexual Exploitation and the United Nations B-Tech Project, which convenes business, civil society and government to advance implementation of the UN Guiding Principles in the tech sector. This year, as part of the Human Rights 75 Initiative, we joined with other B-Tech Community of Practice members to make a public pledge to continue engaging with other companies to share experiences of implementing our respect for human rights commitments.\n\n## Responsible supply chain\n\nWe spend approximately \u20ac19 billion a year with 8,000 direct suppliers around the world 1 to meet our businesses' and customers' needs across network infrastructure, IT and services related to fixed lines, mobile masts and data centres that run our networks.\n\nThe majority of our external spend is managed by our Vodafone Procurement Company ('VPC') based in Luxembourg, and our shared services organisation ('\\_VOIS') based in Ahmedabad, India. A large area of spend is on the products we sell to our customers, including mobile phones, smartwatches, tablets, SIM cards, broadband routers, TV set-top boxes and Internet of Things devices. This centralised approach helps to ensure that we maintain a consistent approach to supplier management across Vodafone, from onboarding and vetting a supplier to raising orders and paying for delivered goods and services.\n\n## Supply chain risks\n\nWe work with other operators collaboratively on supply chain risks within the Joint Alliance for CSR ('JAC'). We currently chair the association of telecommunications operators established to improve ethical, labour and environmental standards in the technology supply chain. We are engaged in workstreams to make progress towards reducing Scope 3 GHG emissions.\n\nJAC reports on progress with respect to third-party factory audits of common suppliers carried out on behalf of all its members in its own reporting.

These commitments extend down through the supply chain so that a supplier with which we have a direct contractual relationship (Tier 1 supplier) in turn is required to ensure compliance across its own direct supply chain (Tier 2 supplier from Vodafone's perspective) and beyond. The Code of Ethical Purchasing is based on international standards, including the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Labour Organization's Fundamental Conventions on Labour Standards. It stipulates the social, ethical and environmental standards that we expect, including in areas such as child and forced labour, health and safety, working hours, discrimination and disciplinary processes.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nClick to read our Code of Ethical Purchasing: vodafone.com/code-of-ethical-purchasing",

        "page_content": "## Our approach\n\nWhen new suppliers tender for work, they are asked to demonstrate compliance to policies and procedures that support safe working, diversity in the workplace, and to address carbon reduction, renewable energy, plastic reduction, circular economy and product life cycle which account for up to 20% of the overall evaluation criteria. Commitments made by our suppliers are assessed against our own purpose strategy with respect to diversity and inclusion (5%), the environment (5%) and health and safety (10%) in categories where there is a safety risk. We have included purpose criteria in all tenders since FY22.\n\nWe continue to assess risk during our onboarding process by using a Supplier Assurance Risk Management (SARM) system for new suppliers in critical-to-business areas. The system uses logic to qualify suppliers in high risk areas that are material to our business, namely cyber security, data privacy, corporate security, environment, antibribery, responsible sourcing, health and safety and payment card industry. Any identified risks require an independent policy expert to approve suppliers before they are onboarded and if necessary to establish a mitigation plan. Our requirements are backed up by risk assessments, audits and operational improvement processes.\n\nTo date, we have improved the supplier qualification process across 19 countries and entities using a risk-based assessment that reviews compliance of any new suppliers before being onboarded to Vodafone. We will continue the rollout across local markets throughout the course of FY25 provided Workers' Council approval is available.\n\nWe report on our approach to preventing modern slavery and human trafficking in our business and supply chain in our Modern Slavery Statement.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nClick to read our Modern Slavery Statement: vodafone.com/modern-slavery-statement\n\n## Governance\n\nThe Chief Financial Officer ('CFO') oversees our supply chain and is a member of the Executive Committee and Board. Reporting to the CFO, the Chief Executive Officer of the VPC is responsible for the implementation of our Code of Ethical Purchasing. Progress is reported regularly to the VPC Board. Procurement is a highly centralised function within the business, with the majority of our external spend managed by the VPC. This enables us to maintain a consistent approach to supplier management and makes it easier to monitor and improve supplier performance across our markets.\n\n## Business integrity\n\nWe aim to ensure that our business operates ethically, lawfully and with integrity wherever we operate as this is critical to our long-term success.\n\n## Tax and economic contribution\n\nAs a major investor, taxpayer and employer, we make a significant contribution to the economies of the countries where we operate. In addition to direct and indirect taxation, our financial contributions to governments also include other areas such as radio spectrum fees and spectrum auction proceeds.\n\n## Tax transparency\n\nOur tax report sets out our total contribution to public finances on a cash-paid basis for both 2022 and 2023. In 2023, we contributed, directly and indirectly, \u20ac9.3 billion (\u20ac12.1 billion including Italy and Spain) to public finances worldwide, compared with \u20ac8.2 billion (\u20ac9.9 billion including Italy and Spain) in 2022. The year-on-year increase was due to \u20ac0.4 billion corporate income tax payments across Europe, as well as \u20ac0.3 billion indirect taxes and \u20ac0.3 billion other telecommunications specific economic contributions, such as payments for the right use spectrum. In 2023, we paid over \u20ac2.6 billion in direct taxes, nearly \u20ac1.3 billion via telecommunications\n\nspecific economic contributions, and collected nearly \u20ac5.4 billion in corporate income taxes for governments around the world.\n\nMaintaining trust in the creation and execution of our tax strategy, policies and practices is absolutely core to our approach to tax, as is our focus on transparency. We disclose our financial contributions to governments at a country level, as we believe this is an important way to demonstrate that it is possible to achieve an effective balance between a company's responsibilities to society as a whole, through the payment of taxes and other government revenue-raising mechanisms, and its obligations to shareholders including that they understand our approach to taxation, policies and principles. The information we share aims to help our stakeholders understand our approach, policies, and principles.\n\nWe share our views on key topics of relevance, including the latest on the taxation of the digital economy, as well as by publishing our OECD country-by-country disclosure, as submitted to the UK's tax authority, HMRC. In addition, we also publish how our disclosures compare to the B Team tax principles and the requirements of the Global Reporting Initiative.\n\nOur tax report for 2024 will be published by the end of the financial year, following the submission of our tax returns and payment of all applicable taxes.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nClick or scan to watch a summary of our approach to taxation: investors.vodafone.com/videos\n\nClick to read more about our tax and economic contribution to public finances: vodafone.com/tax\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Anti-bribery, corruption and fraud\n\nAt Vodafone, we support and foster a culture of zero tolerance towards bribery, corruption or fraud in all our activities.\n\n## Our anti-bribery policy\n\nOur policy on this issue is summarised in our Code of Conduct and states that employees or others working on our behalf must never offer or accept any kind of bribe. Our anti-bribery policy is consistent with the UK Bribery Act and the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and provides guidance about what constitutes a bribe, and prohibits giving or receiving any excessive or improper gifts and hospitality. Any policy breaches can lead to dismissal or termination of contract.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nClick to read our Code of Conduct:\n\nvodafone.com/code-of-conduct\n\nClick to read more about our approach to Anti-bribery and corruption: vodafone.com/sustainable-business/operating-responsibly\n\nFacilitation payments are strictly prohibited, and our employees are provided with training and guidance on how to respond to demands for facilitation payments. The only exception is when an employee's personal safety is at risk. In such circumstances, when a payment under duress is made, the incident must be reported as soon as possible afterwards.\n\nWe regularly monitor our anti-bribery programme to ensure it is implemented through conducting periodic monitoring activities, risk assessment, policy compliance reviews and internal audits.\n\nTo support our approach, we are also a member of Transparency International UK's Business Integrity Forum.",

        "page_content": "## Purpose (continued)\n\n## Governance and risk assessment\n\nOur Group Chief Executive and Executive Committee oversee our efforts to prevent bribery. They are supported by local market chief executive officers, who are responsible for ensuring that our anti-bribery programme is implemented effectively in their local market. They in turn are supported by local specialists and by a dedicated Group team that is solely focused on anti-bribery policy and compliance. The Group Risk and Compliance Committee assists the Executive Committee in fulfilling duties with regard to risk management and policy compliance.\n\nAs part of our anti-bribery programme, every Vodafone business must adhere to minimum global standards, which include:\n\n- -Ensuring there is a due diligence process for suppliers and business partners at the start of the business relationship;\n- -Completion of the global e-learning training for all employees, as well as tailored training for higher risk teams; and\n- -Using Vodafone's online gifts and hospitality registration platform, as well as ensuring there is a process for approving local sponsorships and charitable contributions.\n\nThe risks we face evolve constantly but broadly fall into the areas summarised in the table below, which outlines the principal risk categories and the mitigation measures adopted.\n\nEngaging employees to raise awareness of bribery risk We run a multi-channel high-profile global communications programme, 'Doing What's Right' ('DWR') to engage with employees and raise awareness and understanding of the policy. The DWR programme features e-learning training, including a specific anti-bribery module. Of those employees (including management) assigned training during the period, 96% had completed the training as at 31 March 2024. For higher-risk employees, additional tailored training programmes are used to cover scenarios relevant for those employees. We also conduct internal communication campaigns using a range of materials to highlight some of the key messages around zero tolerance of bribery and corruption, including communications from senior management.\n\n## Assurance\n\nImplementation of the anti-bribery policy is monitored regularly in all local markets as part of the annual Group assurance process, which reviews key anti-bribery controls. During FY24 we completed an on-site policy compliance review in Czech Republic. Further to this, in the DRC, Egypt, Greece, Tanzania, Turkey and Vodafone Group Services, selected key controls were evaluated to ensure their effective implementation. The annual assurance paper submitted to the Group Risk and Compliance Committee documents the key outcomes of these assurance activities and outlines the actions for the programme in the coming year. The results show that the anti-bribery programme has been well implemented and that the markets have strong controls in place to mitigate bribery risks. Some improvement areas were identified in third-party risk management, which remains a key focus area. Appropriate enhancement measures have been put in place.\n\n## Fraud\n\nFraud is a growing threat globally, impacting our customers, reputation, and financial performance. The Executive Committee and the Audit and Risk Committee have recognised this through significant focus on the oversight of management capability development to mitigate the risk of fraud and protect our customers and employees. Vodafone delivers fraud management through a global organisation and operating model, utilising a combination of global (Fraud Centre of Excellence), central (\\_VOIS) and local (dedicated fraud team in each local market and for Group entities) resource. This blend of resources allows us to provide timely, effective, localised responses to any incidences of fraud, whilst also ensuring that any intelligence and best practice that may benefit the wider organisation is curated and shared. We continuously evolve our fraud technology and ways of working, adapting to the tactics used by fraudsters, and also aligning with key partner teams such as cyber security to leverage our respective strengths and establish a robust, layered defence. The protection of customers and support for victims of fraud are paramount in our global fraud strategy. We are working to enhance our capability in these regards through a combination of technical solutions, operational processes and raising awareness.\n\n| Risk                                  | Response                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Operating in  high-risk markets       | We undertake biennial risk assessments in each of our local operating companies and at Group level, so we can  understand and limit our exposure to risk.                                                                                                                                                                       |\n| Business acquisition  and integration | Proportionate anti-bribery pre- and post acquisition due diligence are carried out on a target company.

The processes, methodologies and issues involved in preparing this information are complex. The ESG data, models and methodologies used are often relatively new, are rapidly evolving and are not necessarily of the same standard as those available in the context of financial and other information, nor are they subject to the same or equivalent disclosure standards, historical reference points, benchmarks or globally accepted accounting principles. It is not possible to rely on historical data as a strong indicator of future trajectories in the case of climate change and its evolution. Outputs of models, processed data and methodologies may be affected by underlying data quality, which can be hard to assess, and we expect industry guidance, standards, market practice and regulations in this field to continue to evolve. There are also challenges faced in relation to the ability to access certain data on a timely basis and the lack of consistency and comparability between data that is available. This means the ESG-related forward-looking statements, information and targets discussed in this document carry an additional degree of inherent risk and uncertainty.",

We mitigate these risks through a robust risk management framework and by integrating risk management into our daily operations and culture.\n\n## Governance and identifying our risks\n\nThe Audit and Risk Committee, on behalf of the Board, reviews and challenges the principal and emerging risks as well as advises on the level of risk the Company is willing to take in achieving its strategic goals. The Board approves Vodafone's strategy and aligns the risk management approach with it. The risk function aims to make risk considerations an integral part of executing our strategy, enabling informed decision-making across all our markets.\n\nOur risk management approach is end-to-end, starting with local markets and Group entities identifying and evaluating risks to their local strategy. The Group risk team centrally assesses and challenges these risks. A comprehensive list of risks, along with external risk scanning findings, is presented to the Directors and executives for analysis and identification of significant risks. The proposed principal (pages 58 to 61), watchlist, and emerging (page 62) risks are agreed by our Executive Committee ('ExCo') before being submitted to the Audit and Risk Committee and the Board for review and approval.\n\n## Overview of risk governance structure\n\n## Board/Audit and Risk Committee\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Managing our risks\n\nIt is important to establish the context and understand the environment in which we operate. We categorise our risks into different risk types (strategic, operational, or financial) and identify whether the source of the threat is internal or external. This helps us effectively treat risks and provide appropriate oversight and assurance.\n\nExecutive risk owners have the responsibility to put in place adequate controls and necessary treatment plans to bring risks within acceptable tolerance levels.

These factors could lead to a significant change in the availability and cost of capital.\n\n## Mitigation activities\n\nWe have a relatively resilient business model. We continue to keep a close eye on the possibility of recessions, which could manifest differently across our various jurisdictions. For our consumers who might be affected by an economic downturn, we offer competitive options and social plans and tariffs in the markets in which we operate.

We closely monitor our technology landscape for additional systems nearing end of life and have associated plans to mitigate or replace. Another emerging factor is the inability to deliver large IT transformations at the forecasted pace because of changes in macroeconomic conditions, market pressures, and evolving customer expectations. Additionally, extreme weather events, and deliberate attacks on national critical infrastructure in times of war or instability, could also heighten the risk of technology failure.\n\n## Mitigation activities\n\nTo reduce the impact of service disruptions, we establish recovery goals for critical assets. A global policy outlines the key performance indicators ('KPIs') necessary to guarantee the resilience and security of technology services. We prioritise IT transformation and modernisation programmes, such as the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, SAP RISE, and the recent Azure cloud agreement with Microsoft, to address specific technology resilience risks, while streamlining business processes and simplifying the portfolio. In addition, IT transformation programmes carry risks of scope creep and cost overruns; therefore, we are increasingly using an incremental delivery approach to be able to achieve benefits and adapt quickly, while maintaining strict governance.\n\n## Supply chain disruption\n\n## Description\n\nDisruption in our supply chain could mean that we are unable to execute our strategic plans, resulting in product and service, unavailability and delays, increased cost, reduced choice, and lower network quality.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Scenario\n\nPolitical decisions affecting our ability to use equipment from specific vendors could cause trade and supply chain disruptions.\n\n## Emerging factors\n\nChanges in the political landscape outside Vodafone's control may significantly impact the upgrade and maintenance of our network. For example, US and China tensions resulting in a ban of high-risk vendors, long-term impacts from the war in Ukraine, or potential open conflict between China and Taiwan could impact product availability. Disruption may lead to an increase in our costs in areas such as raw materials, energy, and shipping, while at the same time triggering shortages or extended lead times for critical components.\n\n## Mitigation activities\n\nWe are closely monitoring the evolution of the geopolitical environment. This enables us to respond to emerging challenges and to comply with regulations, economic sanctions and trade rulings. We also mitigate our exposure through having multi-year contracts with key suppliers, forecasting and forward-ordering our inventory requirements in anticipation of extended lead times and continuing to execute our optimisation strategy for network infrastructure logistics.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Additionally, over the past year we have implemented controls, such as hedging for inflation and energy costs to manage the impact of the risk.\n- -The Company transformation risk has been broadened to encompass organisational simplification and other large non-portfolio transformation projects.\n- -The scope of the Technology resilience and future readiness risk has been expanded to include the sub-risk end-of-service-life and legacy infrastructure, as our technology environment is ever-expanding, and we see an increasing number of assets nearing their end of life in this assessment period.\n- -The strategic transformation risk was refocused on Portfolio transformation and governance of investments . As a result, the sub-risk of product innovation has been moved across to the watchlist risks, as detailed in the section below.\n\n## Watchlist risks\n\nOur watchlist risk process enables us to monitor material risks to Vodafone Group that fall outside our principal risks.

In general, we encounter three types of emerging risks. The first type is a new risk in a known context, where it emerges from the external environment and can impact the organisation's activities. An example of this is the potential impact of conflict in the Middle East. The second type is a known risk in a new context, such as the need for new skills and talent to support future services. The third type is a new risk in a new context, such as the impact of the commercial space age.\n\nWe continue to identify new emerging risk trends, using inputs from analysis of the external environment and internal sources. We evaluate our risks across different time periods, allowing us to provide the appropriate level of focus on these emerging risks. We categorise our emerging risk into five different categories: technological, political/regulatory, economic, societal and business environment, so that the relevant expertise across the business can assess the potential impacts and time horizon of these risks.\n\nIn some cases, there may be insufficient information to fully analyse and understand the likelihood, impact or velocity of the risk. As a result, we may not be able to develop a complete mitigation plan until we have a better understanding of the threat.\n\nOur emerging risks, within predefined risk categories, are provided to the ExCo and the Audit and Risk Committee for further scrutiny.\n\n## Building strong foundations\n\nWe continue to enhance and embed the global risk management framework with the objective of maturing our approach. This promotes consistency across all the markets in which we operate.\n\nOver the course of the year under review, we have:\n\n- -Enhanced our risk tooling and methodology to establish a more straightforward process for documenting and reporting risks from our local markets;\n- -Carried out an evaluation to gain a deeper insight into the physical and transition risks associated with climate change;\n- -Improved the process of linking risk and mitigation actions to the budget to improve risk decisions on the risk treatment strategy;\n- -Following the risk awareness campaign in the previous year, conducted a risk culture survey with the Group Senior Leadership Team ('SLT') to gather insights into their understanding of the risk management practices; and\n- -Conducted an external review to benchmark and evaluate the maturity of our risk framework and process.",

This is the period in which we believe our principal risks tend to develop. This time horizon is also in line with the structure of long-term management incentives and the outputs from the long-range business-planning cycle. We continue to conduct financial stress testing and sensitivity analysis, considering revenue at risk.\n\nThe viability assessment started with the available headroom as of 31 March 2024 and considered the plans and projections assembled as part of the forecasting cycle, which include the Group\u0202s cash flow, planned commitments, required funding, and other key financial ratios. We also assumed that debt refinancing will remain available in all plausible market conditions.\n\nFinally, we estimated the impact of severe but plausible scenarios for our principal risks on the three-year plan. We also stress-tested a combined scenario taking into account the risk interdependencies as defined in the table on page 58, where the following risks were modelled as materialising in parallel over the three-year period:\n\nAdverse changes in macroeconomic conditions: Adverse changes in the macroeconomic environment could result in restricted ability to refinance, while prolonged high inflation rates, may lead to increased interest rates.\n\nCyber threat: A cyber-attack may exploit vulnerabilities, allowing unauthorised access to IT and network systems, leading to a breach of information and a potential GDPR fine.\n\nSupply chain disruption: Tensions between the US and China are uncertain, leading to increased volatility in the geopolitical landscape. This has the potential to influence political decisions, which could impact our ability to use equipment from certain vendors.\n\nLegal: Legal disputes and adverse judgements against the company resulting in significant financial liabilities, including increased fines, penalties, or compensatory payments.\n\n## Assessment of long-term prospects\n\nThe Board undertakes a robust review and challenge of the strategy and assumptions. Each year the Board conducts a strategy session, reviewing the internal and external environment as well as significant threats and opportunities to the sustainable creation of long-term shareholder value (note that known emerging factors related to each principal risk are described on pages 58 to 61).\n\nAs an input to the strategy discussion, the Board considers the key risks (including Adverse changes in macroeconomic conditions, Cyber threat, Supply chain disruption, and Legal) with the focus on identifying underlying opportunities and setting the Group\u0202s future strategy. The output from this session is reflected in the strategic section of the Annual Report (page 9), which provides a view of the Group's long-term prospects.\n\n## Conclusions\n\nThe Board assessed the prospects and viability of the Group in accordance with provision 31 of the UK Corporate Governance Code, considering the Group's strategy and business model, and the principal risks to the Group\u0202s future performance, solvency, liquidity and reputation. The assessment took into account possible mitigating actions available to management were any risk or combination of risks to materialise.\n\nCash and cash equivalents available of \u20ac6.1 billion (page 186) at 31 March 2024, along with options available to reduce cash outgoings over the period considered, provide the Group with sufficient positive headroom in all scenarios tested. Reverse stress testing on revenue and adjusted EBITDAaL over the review period confirmed that the Group has sufficient headroom available to face uncertainty. The Board deemed the stress test conducted to be adequate, and therefore confirmed that it has a reasonable expectation that the Group will remain in operation and be able to meet its liabilities as they fall due up to 31 March 2027.\n\n## Assessment of prospects\n\n## Outlook, strategy and business model\n\nOutlook of possible long-term scenarios expected in the sector and the Group's current position to face them Assessment of the key principal risks that may influence the Group's long-term prospects Articulation of the main levers in the Group's strategy and business model to sustain value creation\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Assessment of viability\n\nLong-Range Plan is the three-year forecast approved by the Board on an annual basis, used to calculate cash position and headroom\n\nHeadroom is calculated using cash, cash equivalents and other available facilities, at year end\n\n## Sensitivity analysis\n\n## Principal risks\n\n## Combined scenario\n\nSensitivity analysis to assess the level of decline in performance that the Group could withstand, if a black swan event were to occur\n\nSevere but plausible scenarios modelled to quantify the cash impact of an individual principal risk materialising over the three-year period\n\nQuantification of the cash impact of combined scenarios where multiple risks materialise across one or more markets, over the three-year period\n\nViability results from comparing the cash impact of severe but plausible scenarios to the available headroom, considering additional liquidity options\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Long-term viability statement",

We conducted our first climate-related risk assessment in 2019, and have published a standalone report annually since 2021 - applying the framework of recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures ('TCFD'). From this year, following the incorporation of the TCFD framework into the International Financial Reporting Standards ('IFRS'), we include our climate-related risk reporting here, within our Annual Report. We see this as the next milestone in our journey to integrate the management and disclosure of climate-related risk into our core business processes.\n\nWe continue to report in line with the TCFD framework and its 11 recommendations. This year, we have also prepared this report with reference to the IFRS S2 Climate-related Disclosures standard, in preparation for aligning with this in the future.\n\n## Governance\n\nClimate-related risks are integrated into our risk management framework and the Audit and Risk Committee ('ARC') executes responsibility for these risks on behalf of the Board. Vodafone's proposed principal risks, watchlist risks and emerging risks are reviewed and approved by the Executive Committee ('ExCo') annually before being submitted to the ARC and the Board. During FY24, climate change (which was previously a distinct risk on our watchlist), was consolidated as a sub-risk of Environmental, Social and Governance ('ESG'). This broader ESG risk will be monitored on our watchlist and reported through our risk governance structure.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRead more about our risk\n\ngovernance structure on page 57\n\nRead more about watchlist risks on page 62\n\nOur climate-related risk and resilience programme sits within the Protecting the Planet part of our Purpose strategy, which is ultimately overseen and approved by the ESG Committee. The Committee's responsibility is to oversee Vodafone's response to climate change, as part of our Purpose strategy. The committee meets at least twice per year to provide direction on the management of risks and opportunities to Vodafone's operations and reputation.\n\nAt Executive Committee ('ExCo') level, the ESG and Reputation Steering Committee ('ESGR') is accountable for the implementation of the Purpose strategy, and has appointed an Executive sponsor (the Chief External and Corporate Affairs Officer) to oversee the implementation of the Protecting the Planet pillar of the strategy. The Committee reviews progress of delivery of the Protecting the Planet strategy quarterly, including the assessment and management of climate-related risks and opportunities. The ESGR reports half-yearly to the ESG Committee on the status of the Protecting the Planet strategy, its implementation and progress against targets to support the Board's oversight of the management of climate-related risks. Each year, the ARC and ESG committees meet to jointly review and provide oversight for the annual climate-related risk disclosure.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRead more about the governance of our Purpose strategy on page 33\n\nRead more about our ESG Committee on pages 96 to 97\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAt operational level, the Group Head of Risk coordinates the annual programme to identify and assess climate-related risk, with support from the Head of Sustainable Business. Progress against the annual risk identification and assessment programme is monitored through the ESGR.\n\nActions to strengthen our climate resilience and mitigate climaterelated risks were included in our Vodafone Group Climate Transition Plan ('CTP'). Accountability for the design and implementation of these actions and initiatives is assigned to individual senior managers, within a range of relevant business functions across Vodafone's global business including our networks and technology operations, commercial and enterprise business units, procurement, external affairs and property teams.",

Accountable delivery functions report quarterly to the ESGR, including raising any risks to the delivery of the plan. As a crossfunctional strategic programme, business functions accountable for the delivery of the transition plan include procurement, commercial, brand and marketing, networks and technology, enterprise, products and services, amongst others.\n\nThe ESGR identifies any significant business decisions (for example, major transactions or changes to business strategy) that could impact Vodafone's climate resilience or change the severity or likelihood of climate-related risks. Any risks or issues identified are evaluated by the risk and sustainable business teams, and if necessary escalated through the Protecting the Planet and Purpose governance structure to the ESGR.\n\nWe have an internal global policy, owned by the Chief External and Corporate Affairs Officer, to establish the minimum requirements for environmental management. All Vodafone entities within the Group's operational control (including within Vodacom) are required to adhere to this policy. The policy includes requirements to annually review climate-related risks and opportunities within the context of each market we operate in, and incorporate any significant findings into our overall Group-level climate-related risk assessment. The policy also includes requirements to implement the CTP, which assigns responsibility for taking climate action and building climate resilience, in line with our strategy, to management across our global business.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nClick to read more about our Climate Transition Plan:\n\nwww.vodafone.com/ctp\n\n## Strategy\n\nFor FY24, our climate-related risk assessment builds upon our previous analyses, including our quantitative scenario analysis of physical climate risk in Europe and Vodacom's assessment of climate-related risks in Africa. We also conducted a review of transition risks, which involved desk-based research, internal stakeholder interviews and a qualitative scenarios analysis, applying time horizons consistent with our physical risk analysis.\n\nOverall, this year's risk assessment has led to a refreshed list of our priority climate-related risks and opportunities.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRead more about our approach to climate-related risk assessment on page 66\n\n## Our priority climate-related risks and opportunities 1\n\nPhysical risks\n\n(1) Extreme weather: Damage to assets or disruption to our own operations or supply chain due to extreme weather events such as storms and cyclones, flooding and wildfires. Our network infrastructure assets are already being affected by extreme weather (e.g. flooding in Germany, wildfires in Greece, cyclones in Mozambique), although currently at a scale that can be managed to avoid major operational impact, asset impairment or cost. Longer term, in combination with geopolitical risks, extreme weather could disrupt supply chains, particularly those that depend on critical regions (such as China for electronic components) or locations (such as coastal ports).\n\nTime horizon: Medium term\n\n(2) Rising average temperatures: Rising average temperatures could damage network equipment and other above-ground infrastructure or cause operational failure (particularly if located in exposed outdoor locations, e.g. radio towers), as well as cause disruption in our supply chain. It could also lead to increasing consumption of energy for cooling infrastructure, data centres and offices, which could increase operating costs. We expect this risk to materialise in the medium term, with the most severe impacts in the 'business as usual' scenario. Higher frequency of hot days is likely to be more pronounced in our southern European markets (such as Greece and Portugal) and in African markets.\n\nTime horizon: Medium term\n\n## Transition risks\n\n(3) Energy costs: Increasingly volatile energy prices and overall higher energy costs, partially driven by carbon pricing and demand for renewable electricity certificates outstripping supply. This risk is particularly prevalent in markets with high dependency on fossil fuels (e.g. to operate diesel generators) and non-renewable energy. However, carbon pricing will also drive an increase in cost to procure carbon-intensive products and raw materials, as third parties upstream in the supply chain look to pass through higher costs. Time horizon: Short term\n\n(4) Regulatory compliance costs: As governments introduce policies to support the climate transition, these could impact our product portfolio (such as energy use of fixed line or mobile devices), operations (such as data centres) or corporate sustainability reporting and disclosures. Over the medium term, as these are transposed into law in each of our markets, this could result in a cost to comply or a financial risk from non-compliance.\n\nTime horizon: Medium term\n\n(5) Expectations of business customers: Loss of market share if climate performance continues to be a differentiator during supplier selection by business customers, and Vodafone does not keep pace with the low carbon products and services offered by competitors, or rising business customer expectations for adhering to climate-related requirements.\n\nTime horizon: Medium term\n\n(6) Greenwashing risk: Misleading claims about the environmental impact of Vodafone (at a corporate reporting or brand communications level) or its products and services (at a product marketing level) could result in reputation damage, loss of revenues or possibly legal costs. Time horizon: Medium term\n\n## Transition opportunity\n\n(7) Customer enablement: Revenue growth from the design and deployment of green digital solutions that enable business customers to reduce their own GHG emissions, as they seek technology solutions to support their own climate transition. Time horizon: Medium term\n\n## Note:",

Our analysis indicates that in Europe a relatively small proportion (6.6%) of our network assets could be at high or very high risk of damage from climate perils that could incur more significant cost. Transition risks, if left unmitigated, could materialise into business impacts within the short to medium term (within the next five years), potentially incurring increased operating costs, costs to comply with regulation, loss of revenue from business customers and reputational damage. However, the severity of these impacts is unlikely to be financially material. The potential commercial value creation from capturing the growing market for green digital solutions is greatest in this scenario, as industries seek to decarbonise in response to policy and market incentives.\n\n## Late policy action (<2.5\u00b0C)\n\nIn the late policy action scenario, we can expect physical impacts of climate change to be more severe and frequent, incurring higher costs and disruption to operations and supply chains. Some transition risks would materialise, for the most part within the medium term, in relation to increasing regulatory and compliance costs and increasing expectations from business customers for sustainable products and services.\n\n## No policy action (<4\u00b0C)\n\nIn the no policy action scenario, our exposure to physical risks in Europe increases marginally, with an estimated 7.0% of our network assets at high or very high risk of damage from climate perils such as storms and heavy precipitation, which could cause damage to our network assets or operational disruption. The exposure of our own operations to physical risks could be more severe in Africa, where temperature increases could be 1.5 to 2 times the average global temperature increase. This scenario also results in the greatest physical climate change impacts for our supply chains, which could result in increased cost or supply chain disruption (particularly where the production of goods is concentrated in geographies vulnerable to climate change). Transition risks are lowest in this scenario. There may be market growth opportunities in this scenario as customers seek technology solutions to help adapt to physical changes in the climate.\n\n## Building climate resilience into our business strategy\n\nAs a fixed and mobile network operator, we have a large number of assets and infrastructure spread over a wide geographical area in all of the markets in which we operate. This means that our business is exposed to climate change impacts and transition risks across Europe and Africa.\n\nHowever, our analysis indicates that Vodafone's underlying business model is relatively resilient to climate-related risk. Vodafone's physical risk exposure is not expected to result in significant cost or asset impairment, with a relatively limited range of impacts expected across the range of scenarios analysed, particularly in Europe. This is partly due to the level of resilience that is already built into our network infrastructure and because the majority of our assets (such as radio equipment) are relatively short-lived with opportunity to adapt our network as part of our routine end-of-life equipment replacement programme. However, more widespread operational disruption (within both our own operations and in our value chain) due to extreme weather events and extreme heat can be expected over the medium to long term in the no policy action scenario, particularly in Africa.\n\nAcross the scenarios, transition risks are unlikely to result in financially material impacts. We intend to undertake further quantitative scenario analysis of our highest priority transition risks to reinforce these conclusions.",

In recent years, we note that insurance claims have been made to cover damage to infrastructure. For example, in relation to flooding in Germany and wildfires in Greece and Portugal, these claims relate mostly to damage to our mobile access base station network, rather than our higher value assets, such as data or technology centres, and are not considered to be financially material at this stage. Based on our analyses to date, we have not identified any material financial risks relating to the cost or availability of insurance as a result of climate change.\n\nThere are opportunities for value creation across the range of scenarios. In both the early and late policy action scenarios, there is potential for commercial growth from the sale of digital solutions that can help our customers to decarbonise their businesses. Whereas the no policy action scenario presents growth opportunities from sale of digital solutions that help our customers adapt to more extreme physical changes in the climate.\n\nOur CTP incorporates the management actions required to build resilience into our business in response to Vodafone's priority climate-related risks and opportunities. Our latest analysis, outlined in this report, has informed the transition plan activities that have been integrated into our long-range business and financial planning cycle. Governance and accountability have been put in place to monitor and manage the implementation of the transition plan.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nClick to read our Climate Transition Plan:\n\nwww.vodafone.com/ctp\n\n## Resilience to physical risks\n\nProtecting our infrastructure assets from being damaged or disrupted by climate-related weather events is central to the climate resilience of our business and network services. Mitigation measures are built into the key stages of each asset's life cycle, from acquisition to maintenance, and cover climate adaptation as well as damage response. During the acquisition of assets, including buildings and network equipment, we have policies and guidance in place to incorporate the assessment of environmental risks. Our internal technology resilience policy requires each asset to conduct a physical risk assessment annually, which includes evaluating environmental risks. We also have reactive measures related to asset maintenance in place, such as processes and teams dedicated to disaster recovery and business continuity. Lastly, we have insurance policies designed to transfer any significant financial impact of physical risks, which cover claims on asset loss and damage.\n\nBuilding resilience into our operations and network infrastructure is a well-established part of our business-as-usual process, irrespective of whether climate change has been explicitly named as a primary risk driver. We intend to continue to build resilience to the physical risks of climate change and intend to integrate any additional high-priority climate adaptation actions beyond our current planning, procurement, network resilience and business continuity practices into our CTP over the coming year.\n\n## Resilience to transition risks\n\nDecarbonising our business model and improving energy efficiency will help to minimise our exposure to transition risks. We have set targets to reduce greenhouse gas ('GHG') emissions from our own operations and to become net zero across our full value chain by 2040 (including at least 90% absolute emission reduction, with any remaining emissions neutralised through high quality carbon offsetting).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRead more about our Protect the Planet goals and strategy on pages 38 to 42\n\n## Our CTP includes workstreams on:\n\n- -Climate-related policy - to formalise the role of our public affairs, legal and tax teams in identifying, monitoring and responding to the ever-evolving landscape of climate-related policy and regulation.\n- -Power purchase agreements - to limit exposure to energy price volatility by increasing the proportion of renewable electricity purchased through power purchase agreements ('PPAs') as part of our energy procurement strategy.\n- -Transition plan reporting - to manage our exposure to reputational risks such as greenwashing, by communicating clearly and transparently on our climate strategy and continuing to implement strong governance over the use of environmental claims in our brand, marketing and corporate communications.\n\n## Realising opportunities\n\nOur most significant climate-related opportunity relates to developing new product lines to enable our enterprise customers to reduce GHG emissions, improve resource efficiency and protect or enhance nature. This enablement effect is a key pillar of our Planet strategy.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRead more about our approach to enablement\n\non page 41\n\nOur CTP includes a workstream on 'sustainability by design'. This is to develop and deploy more green digital solutions, such as IoT solutions for smart cities, buildings or lower-carbon transport and mobility, that can help our customers manage their environmental impact, whilst also minimising the negative environmental impact from the production of our products and services.\n\n## Risk management\n\nThe management of climate-related risks follows the process defined by our enterprise risk management framework, which is defined centrally and implemented in each of our markets. Our approach to climate-related risk assessment is outlined below.\n\n## (1) Identify\n\nTo identify potential climate-related risks and opportunities, we review the relevant sources of information such as media articles, publications, industry peer disclosures and industry white papers, in addition to reviewing our previous years' analyses. We engage with relevant internal and external experts to gather views on the evolving nature of climate-related risks for the telecommunications sector and examples of any climate change impacts that might already be materialising.\n\n## (2) Measure\n\nWe assess the likelihood and severity of impact for each risk and opportunity identified. We simulate how the risks and opportunities could materialise over three time horizons, across a range of possible future scenarios. We review our scenarios analysis annually to reflect the most up-to-date information on climate-related trends.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRead more about our definitions for scenarios and time horizons\n\non page 66\n\nIn assessing the severity of an impact, we consider the relative extent of the potential financial impact through business value drivers such as increased costs, loss of revenue, asset impairment and damage to brand or corporate reputation. In assessing the likelihood of an impact, we consider the potential probability that it will materialise based on current trends, forecasts and projections and levels of uncertainty.\n\nWe have conducted a quantitative scenarios analysis for physical risks in both Europe and Africa. For transition risks and opportunities, their severity and likelihood has been assessed qualitatively across our selected scenarios and time horizons.\n\nWe are working towards estimating the financial value at stake from climate-related risks across our global business, which will depend upon the completion of a fully quantitative scenarios analysis for both physical and transition risks. We aim to complete this quantitative scenarios analysis (including transition risks) within the coming year.",

Overall, this assessment involved screening over 650 assets across Spain, Italy, the UK, Germany and Greece, under both RCP 2.6 (early policy action scenario) and RCP 8.5 (no policy action scenario), to identify assets at 'high' or 'very high' risk of damage.\n\nWe screened assets from three categories of our infrastructure asset portfolio, which are considered critical to our operations:\n\n- -Low-rise structures such as offices and bunkers;\n- -Control room assets such as technical buildings, warehouses and data centres; and\n- -Station assets such as railway stations.\n\nThe impact on the assets was assessed in relation to the following eight climate perils:\n\n- 1. Coastal inundation\n- 2. River flood\n- 3. Surface-water flood\n- 4. Extreme heat\n\n5. Extreme wind\n\n6. Wildfire\n\n7. Freeze thaw\n\n8. Drought-driven subsidence\n\nThe nature and likelihood of the impact of the climate perils was modelled at a granular resolution based on external climate data sets, overlaid with the geolocation of each asset.\n\nThe magnitude of the potential impacts was assessed based on the potential value at stake in terms of:\n\n- -Damage ratio (average proportion of damage to an asset in a given year);\n- -Expected cost of damage (financial cost of remedying damage sustained); and\n- -Failure probability (annual probability of a climate hazard causing the asset to stop working).\n\nBetween 6.6% and 7.0% of analysed sites were identified as being at 'high' or 'very high' risk of damage from climate perils by 2050 (rising to 7.2% to 8.1% by 2100), defined as:\n\n- -High: Expected cost of damage notable, with potential cost implications; and\n- -Very high: Widespread damage/disruption.\n\nThe majority of value at stake resulting from climate perils across the asset portfolio is associated with the top 10 at-risk assets.\n\nFive of the assets at 'high' or 'very high' risk were selected for a deep dive analysis of potential operational and financial impacts, to understand the potential drivers of financial loss and mitigation actions. The most significant drivers contributing to the expected cost of damage for these assets were coastal inundation and riverine flooding. By 2100, in the scenario with no policy action, all five sites were also expected to be at high risk of operational failure due to extreme heat events.\n\nFindings from our 2022 physical risk assessment were reinforced by an additional study of physical risks conducted during FY24 with a particular focus on understanding implications for insurance of over 80 of our highest value assets. This year's most recent study concurred with the findings of our 2022 physical risk assessment, highlighting the increased risk of flooding and heatwaves that could impact our operations in the long term.\n\n## Our approach to climate-related risk assessment in Africa\n\nVodacom Group publishes a standalone report disclosing details of our climate-related risk and opportunity assessment for our markets in Africa.\n\nClick to read Vodacom Group's latest TCFD report:\n\nvodacom.com/reporting-centre\n\nOur 2023 analysis confirmed that our markets in Africa will be exposed to increased occurrence and severity of extreme weather events - with impacts already being felt today. Climate perils include increasing temperatures, drought conditions and increased rainfall, storm surges and cyclonic activity. For example, in March 2023 Cyclone Freddy (one of the most powerful and longest-lasting cyclones that has impacted Mozambique since the beginning of 2022) impacted our operations, workforce and assets.\n\nSimilarly, Vodacom's climate-related risk and opportunity analysis confirms that our business will be affected by transition risks in relation to evolving stakeholder expectations, policies and market evolution.\n\n## Our approach to transition risk assessment\n\nIn FY24, we conducted qualitative scenarios analysis of transition risks across our global business, including both Europe and Africa.\n\nBased on desk research, industry peer comparison and expert insights, we identified 67 risks and opportunities that could be relevant to Vodafone Group. We shortlisted 28 of these for further analysis based on a preliminary screening of their relative potential severity, likelihood and time horizon of impact.\n\nUsing insights from internal engagement with cross-functional stakeholders, the shortlist was synthesised into seven priority risks and opportunities. Five of which are related to the low carbon transition, which we consider could reasonably be expected to affect Vodafone Group's prospects. Looking across three future scenarios, we conducted a qualitative analysis of the most significant transition risks and opportunities.\n\nWe mapped out impact pathways to understand how the climate-related transition risks could lead to outcomes and impacts on Vodafone and their potential to result in financial impact (for example, through asset impairment, increased costs or loss of revenue). This included examining the potential impacts on our own operations and potential impacts on our suppliers, which could, in turn, affect the security of supply of goods and services to Vodafone. We assessed the extent to which the steps in the impact pathways could occur in a range of scenarios based on published research of future market, policy and legal and stakeholder sentiment trends and forecasts.\n\nThe results of our qualitative scenarios analysis of transition risks and opportunities supplement the findings of our 2022 quantitative scenarios analysis of physical risks. In combination, these provide us with a reasonable and holistic view of how our highest priority climate-related risks and opportunities could play out over time.",

During FY24, climate change was consolidated as a sub-risk of ESG risk, in recognition that climate is one of several wider ESG risks that we intend to manage holistically. In addition, this aligns with our internal governance structures for ESG, which encompass all aspects of our Protecting the Planet and wider Purpose strategy. ESG risk was considered a watchlist risk, partly due to the time horizon of climate-related risk being mostly outside the immediate three-year business planning cycle.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRead more about our ESG governance arrangements\n\non page 33\n\nWe will continue to monitor ESG risk as this agenda continues to evolve in the coming years. In addition, due to the nature of the priority climate-related risks to our business and strategy, many elements are already captured in existing principal risks, such as extreme weather events leading to technology failure, adverse policy environment resulting in increased costs or increased energy costs arising due to adverse changes in macroeconomic conditions. This approach enables us to capture a more holistic picture of the climate-related risks, both in the short term and long term.\n\nAs required by our risk management framework, once a risk is identified and assessed, a risk owner is responsible for developing and implementing the mitigating actions and controls. This year, we incorporated the key mitigating actions for our highest priority climate-related risks and opportunities into our CTP and assigned accountability to leaders in relevant business functions for managing and monitoring these.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nClick to read our Climate Transition Plan\n\nwww.vodafone.com/ctp\n\n## (4) Assure and monitor\n\nWe use a three lines model, as detailed in the Group risk management framework, when managing risks. Relevant assurance providers, such as control owners in the first and second line, are responsible for reviewing the policies, procedures and other relevant information to check whether the controls are effective and update them as necessary.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRead more about our Group risk management framework on pages 57-63\n\n## (5) Report\n\nAs described in the Governance section of this report, reporting of our climate-related risks is integrated into our enterprise risk management framework and processes, which are overseen by ARC. The Group Risk team reports Vodafone's principal risks, watchlist risks and emerging risks to the ExCo and the Board, including any material climate-related risks that are identified through risk analyses. During the year, if climate-related risks are identified at operational level, they are reported to the local risk and compliance committee within each market and escalated to the Group Risk and Compliance Committee if required.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRead more about our climate governance arrangements on pages 64 to 65\n\n## Metrics and targets\n\nWe have set targets to reduce GHG emissions from both our own operations and across our full value chain. In FY24, we set regionspecific net zero targets for our operational emissions (Scope 1 and 2) in recognition that the transition pathway and challenges are fundamentally different in Europe and Africa. Although our transition pathways differ by region, we are retaining our overall near-term science-based target to reduce the emissions from our own operations (Scope 1 and 2) by at least 90% by 2030 across our global business, against a FY20 baseline.\n\nThe Protecting the Planet section of our Annual Report, together with our ESG Addendum and Methodology document, details our approach to measuring and reducing GHG emissions. We measure and report our Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions (including all 15 categories of Scope 3). We also have metrics in place to measure energy use; one of the key underlying factors in our exposure to climate-related transition risk.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRead more about our climate metrics and targets in the Protecting the Planet section on page 38 to 42\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nClick to read our ESG Addendum: investors.vodafone.com/esgaddendum\n\nClick to read our ESG Methodology document: investors.vodafone.com/esgmethodology\n\n| Climate-related risk/opportunity metrics                                    | 2024   | 2023   | 2022   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Total Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions  (market-based) (million tonnes CO2e) 1 | 0.69   | 0.91   | 1.02   |\n| Scope 3 emissions (million tonnes CO2e) 1,2                                 | 6.07   | 6.92   | 6.91   |\n| Energy use (gigawatt hours) 1                                               | 5,217  | 5,052  | 4,926  |\n| Carbon enablement (million tonnes CO2e)                                     | 32.8   | 24.9   | 13.5   |\n\n## Notes:\n\n- 1.

This is linked to our near-term science-based target to reduce the emissions from our own operations (Scope 1 and 2) by at least 90% by 2030 across our global business, against a FY20 baseline. 3.3% of executive long-term incentive plan is linked to this climate metric. We continue to explore how we can integrate climate resilience into our reward structures, objectives and incentives.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRead more about how ESG is incorporated into our remuneration policy on page 108\n\nWe continue to measure our exposure to physical risks, for example, the percentage of our high-value assets that are vulnerable to physical risks in Europe.\n\nWe report annually on the carbon emissions avoided through the use of our digital solutions, which we consider to be one of our most significant climate-related commercial opportunities, known as 'carbon enablement'.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nClick to read more about how we measure carbon enablement in our ESG Addendum: investors.vodafone.com/ esgaddendum\n\nRead more about our targets for enablement on page 41\n\nWhilst these are important steps forward on our climate-related risk disclosure journey, we recognise that we have not yet set targets or put metrics in place to measure our full suite of climate-related physical and transition risks. We remain committed to setting these metrics and targets in line with the refreshed list of our priority climate-related risks and opportunities. The establishment of metrics and targets will form part of the implementation of our transition plan, which commenced from 1 April 2024. We intend to develop metrics and targets within the coming year. Our transition plan also outlines the areas of uncertainty, dependency on key external factors and risks to the delivery of our targets.\n\nCurrently, we are also considering the opportunity to use an internal carbon price as part of our decision-making. An internal carbon price puts a financial value on the climate impact of our business decisions (such as purchasing goods or undertaking capital projects). We have begun to explore potential options for an internal carbon price, for evaluation and possible implementation in future years.",

The Nominations and Governance Committee and the Board have also considered succession planning at a number of meetings.\n- -Operational performance: The Board spent a full day in September 2023 focusing on the Group's three strategic priorities and the initiatives supporting them. Additional sessions and updates on these initiatives featured in the remaining FY24 Board meetings including a deep dive into the satellite strategy and an update on deep detractor reductions.\n- -Technology: In May 2023, the Board approved the establishment of the Technology Committee.

The Committee recognises the need to anticipate the skills and attributes that will be needed on the Board as the Company develops. Committee focus during FY24 was on the appointment of the Group Chief Executive and the Group Chief Financial Officer, the establishment of the Technology Committee, and Board Committee composition following the departure of long-standing Non-Executive Directors at the conclusion of the 2023 AGM.

        "page_content": "## Chair\u0202s governance statement\n\n## We take our commitment to strong and robust corporate governance seriously\n\n## Dear shareholders,\n\nOn behalf of the Board, I am pleased to present the Corporate Governance Report for the year ended 31 March 2024.\n\nThis report provides details about the Board and an explanation of our individual roles and responsibilities. It also provides an insight into the activities of the Board and Committees over the year and how we seek to ensure the highest standards of corporate governance remain embedded throughout the Company, underpinning and supporting our business and the decisions we make.\n\n## The year in review\n\nIn May 2023, we set out a new roadmap for Vodafone, based on our need to change and focus on three priorities: Customers, Simplicity and Growth. Since then we have seen Vodafone's transformation progress, and I would like to give great thanks to my fellow Directors, the executive team, and the people of Vodafone for their spirit, ambition and hard work. There is much more that needs to be done for us to achieve our ambition of being a best-in-class telco in Europe and Africa, as well as the leading platform for business in Europe, but I am confident we are on the right trajectory.\n\n## Strategic Transformation\n\nThis financial year has seen a lot of transactional activity for Vodafone. In May 2023, we announced entering into a strategic partnership and Relationship Agreement with Emirates Telecommunications Group Company PJSC (\u0201e&\u0202), establishing e& as a cornerstone shareholder of the Company. The strategic relationship enables collaboration across a broad range of growth areas. Under the terms of the Relationship Agreement, the Group Chief Executive Officer of e&, Hatem Dowidar, joined the Vodafone Board as a Non-Executive Director on 19 February 2024. The e& Group Chief Executive will have the right to be an appointed Non-Executive Director, subject to shareholder approval, for as long as e& maintains its current shareholding of 14.6%.\n\nIn June 2023, we announced entering into a binding agreement with Hutchison Group Telecom Holdings Limited in relation to a combination of our UK telecommunication businesses, Vodafone UK and Three UK. If approved, this merger will be great for customers, great for the country and great for competition. It is transformative and will create a best-in-Europe 5G network.\n\nIn October 2023, we announced the sale of Vodafone Spain, which we believe is a key step in right-sizing our portfolio for growth and will enable us to focus our resources in markets with sustainable structures and sufficient local scale.\n\nIn November 2023, we announced a strategic partnership with Accenture to accelerate the commercialisation of our shared operations to advance growth, enhance customer service and drive significant efficiencies for Vodafone's operating companies and partner markets, as well as create new career opportunities for our people.\n\nOn 16 January 2024, we signed a 10-year strategic partnership with Microsoft to bring generative AI, digital services and the cloud to more than 300 million businesses and consumers.\n\nOn 15 March 2024, we announced the sale of Vodafone Italy to Swisscom AG and a broad review of our capital allocation considering the investment profile of the Group\u0202s strategy within its reshaped footprint.\n\nThe capital allocation review concluded that country-level capital intensity would be broadly maintained at existing levels, a robust balance sheet would be maintained with a new leverage policy, the ordinary dividend would be rebased to 4.5 eurocents per share from FY25 onwards, and there would be an opportunity for share buybacks following the completion of the sale of Vodafone Spain and Vodafone Italy.\n\nThese transactions formed part of Vodafone's transformational progress, with the sale of Vodafone Italy being the last step in our portfolio transformation, helping us to move forward with our roadmap and achieve our ambition.\n\n## Board composition\n\n## Executive Directors\n\nLuka Mucic joined the Board as Group Chief Financial Officer on 1 September 2023 following an extensive external recruitment process with the support of Egon Zehnder, an independent external search firm. The Board and I have been impressed with the pace with which Luka has got to grips with the Company and the strong relationship he and Margherita are building.\n\nThe appointment of Luka enabled Margherita Della Valle to fully transition into her role as Group Chief Executive. During the year, Margherita has continued to demonstrate her strong capabilities in being able to lead the necessary transformation of Vodafone.\n\n## Non-Executive Directors\n\nAs I discussed in last year's report, there were a number of scheduled changes in the composition of our Non-Executive Directors expected during FY24, with the retirement of Valerie Gooding, Sir Crispin Davis and Dame Clara Furse. David Nish was appointed Senior Independent Director, Amparo Moraleda was appointed Remuneration Committee Chair and Delphine Ernotte Cunci and Christine Ramon were appointed Workforce Engagement Leads.\n\nFollowing Hatem Dowidar's appointment earlier this year, he has begun a full induction programme, including meetings with executives leading our businesses and functions.\n\nThe Board and Nominations and Governance Committee anticipate scheduled retirements in FY25 and, therefore, already have a renewed focus on succession planning. We will continue to closely monitor the diversity and skill sets needed to drive the Company forward.\n\n## Diversity\n\nOur commitment to having a Board diverse in all aspects firmly remains. The Nominations and Governance Committee continues to support the Board in monitoring requirements and best practices. We are proud to meet gender targets requiring Boards to comprise of at least 40% women. This includes our Group Chief Executive, Margherita Della Valle. We also exceed the Parker Review target to have at least one Director from a minority ethnic group.\n\nBeyond the Board, you may recall that last year we announced the introduction of a new ethnic diversity target, for 25% of our global senior leadership to be from ethnically diverse backgrounds by 2030. We are making great progress towards this target.\n\n## Skills\n\nThe changes in composition in the year have bolstered the Board and demonstrated that diversity, skills and knowledge are effectively regarded when composition is considered. The Board and I believe our composition, with highly relevant sector expertise, makes us well placed to advise and provide management oversight.\n\nOn 10 May 2023, the Board approved the creation of a Technology Committee to oversee the technology strategy and how it supports the overall Company strategy. The Committee was established on 25 July 2023 and has already proved to be a significant enhancement to our governance structure.\n\n## Evaluation\n\nFor the second year in a row, the Board undertook an internal evaluation which I led with support from the Group General Counsel and Company Secretary. Individual Directors were invited to complete a self-assessment questionnaire as well as speaking with me",

I am delighted to report there was a clear consensus that the Board is very effective in working together as a cohesive unit and continues to improve following the changes made during the year. A number of strengths were identified as well as key areas for focus during the year ahead.\n\n## Executive Committee composition\n\nWith effect from 1 April 2024, we made a number of changes to our Executive Committee. Ahmed Essam was appointed Executive Chairman Vodafone Germany and CEO European Markets, Serpil Timuray was appointed CEO Vodafone Investments, and Philippe Rogge stood down from his role as CEO Vodafone Germany and as a member of the Group Executive Committee, leaving Vodafone. Marcel de Groot was appointed CEO Vodafone Germany and Max Taylor appointed CEO Vodafone UK. Both Marcel and Max report to Ahmed Essam but are not members of the Executive Committee,\n\nMarika Auramo has been appointed CEO of Vodafone Business and a member of Vodafone's Executive Committee, with effect from 1 July 2024. Marika will take over from Giorgio Migliarina, who has successfully led Vodafone Business as interim CEO since Vinod Kumar's departure on 31 December 2023.\n\n## Stakeholder engagement\n\nThe Board is committed to understanding the views of all of Vodafone's stakeholders to inform the decisions that we make. We recognise that Vodafone's success is dependent on the Board taking decisions for the benefit of our shareholders and in doing so having regard to all our stakeholders.\n\nThroughout the year, I have met with institutional shareholders both virtually and in person. In March 2024, I had individual meetings with a number of the Company's largest shareholders and engaged on topics such as capital allocation, Board composition and the shape of the Group. Further resources were made available to individual shareholders during the year, such as online presentations hosted by the UK Individual Shareholders Society. I have also met senior political leaders in both my role as Vodafone Chair and as the Chair of the European Round Table for Industry. These include presidents and prime ministers across our markets and in key international organisations such as the European Commission. The Board received an update on the investor perception study completed during the year.\n\nThe Board understands the importance of culture and setting the tone of the organisation from the top and embedding it throughout the Group. We refer to our culture as the 'Spirit of Vodafone'. It is a key component of our strategic, organisational and digital transformation. The aim of our people strategy is to create an environment where growing never stops and everyone can truly belong, innovate and fulfil their potential. The Board receives regular updates on employee engagement and the 'Spirit of Vodafone', which enables it to make informed decisions where appropriate.\n\nDuring the year, in their roles as Workforce Engagement Leads, Delphine Ernotte Cunci and Christine Ramon gathered the views of employees through employee consultative committees across our European and African markets. Key discussion topics included customer experience, and personal development and reskilling opportunities.\n\nThe Annual General Meeting ('AGM') in 2023 was held at Vodafone UK's headquarters in Newbury, Berkshire and was available to watch live via a webcast for those shareholders who were unable to attend in person. Shareholders were able to pre-submit questions or, if attending in person, ask questions on the day, for consideration by the Directors at the meeting. We intend to hold the 2024 AGM in the same format.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## The year ahead\n\nA key focus for the Board and I for FY25 will be on succession planning in anticipation of upcoming scheduled retirements, whilst also continuing to support Luka, Margherita and Hatem in their new roles.\n\nIn addition, the Board will continue to drive for sustainable value creation and monitor the Company's progress on the execution of Vodafone's strategy focusing on Customers, Simplicity and Growth. The Board will keep the Group's strategy under review, adapting it to anticipate or respond to opportunities and risks in the markets in which we operate.\n\nThank you for your continued support.\n\n## Jean-Fran\u00e7ois van Boxmeer\n\nChair of the Board\n\n## Compliance with the 2018 UK Corporate Governance Code (the \u0201Code\u0202)\n\nIn respect of the year ended 31 March 2024, Vodafone Group Plc was subject to the Code (available from www.frc.org.uk). The Board is pleased to confirm that Vodafone applied the principles and complied with all the provisions of the Code throughout the year.

Consideration was also given to the arrangements in place to monitor conflicts of interest.\n\nAll Directors have access to the advice of the Company Secretary, who is responsible for advising the Board on all governance matters and ensuring the Board has access to the necessary policies, processes and resources to operate efficiently and effectively.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRead more about our governance structure and roles and responsibilities on pages 74-75\n\n## Values and culture\n\nThe Board has a critical role in setting the tone of our organisation and championing the behaviours we expect to see throughout the Group.

The Board has continued to influence and monitor culture throughout the year and received updates on 'Spirit of Vodafone' initiatives, including 'Spirit of Vodafone' Days, bi-annual Spirit Beat surveys, the global pulse survey and surveys shared with new hires and leavers.\n\nThe cultural climate in Vodafone is measured through a number of mechanisms including policy and compliance processes, internal audit, and formal and informal channels for employees to raise concerns. The latter includes our Spirit Beat survey and our whistleblowing programme, Speak Up, which is also available to the contractors and suppliers working with us. The Board is apprised of any material whistleblowing incidents.\n\nAlongside these mechanisms, the Board remains committed to engagement with the workforce, and these opportunities continue to shape how the Board influences and understands the Company's culture.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Employee engagement\n\nGiven the geographical size and complexity of our business, we utilise several employee engagement methods and communication channels between the Board, the Executive Committee, and our workforce to enable meaningful engagement.\n\nExamples of these initiatives include:\n\nWorkforce Engagement Lead attendance at employee forums The Board received feedback from Delphine Ernotte Cunci and Christine Ramon, the appointed Workforce Engagement Leads, after their attendance at employee forums in Europe and Africa. It is evident from these meetings that employee delegates continue to appreciate the opportunity to speak directly to a Board member. Through these channels we understand that our people are engaged and interested in market mergers & acquisitions, the customer experience and opportunities for personal development and reskilling.\n\n## Workplace communications\n\n'Workplace' is our internal digital platform that allows employees to start conversations and groups on topics of their choice.

On 14 November 2023, we announced an interim dividend of 4.50 eurocents per share, which was paid on 2 February 2024. We have recommended a final dividend of 4.5 eurocents per share to be paid on 2 August 2024.

The Board also attended a strategy off-site session in Germany that focused on strategic evolution, execution of the strategic priorities and portfolio objectives.\n\n## UK\n\nBoard discussion focused on the strategic options available to the UK business. The proposed merger of Vodafone UK and Three UK provides the necessary scale to be able to accelerate the rollout of full 5G coverage, benefiting customers through competitively priced access to a reliable, high-quality, and secure 5G network throughout the UK.

As part our broader capital allocation review, the Company intends to return up to \u20ac2 billion to shareholders via buybacks following the completion of the sale of Vodafone Spain, with an opportunity for further share buybacks of up to \u20ac2 billion following the completion of the sale of Vodafone Italy.\n\n## Spain\n\nThe Board received regular updates on the transaction opportunities available to the business portfolio in Spain. In October 2023, we announced that the Board had taken the decision to enter into binding agreements with Zegona Communications plc ('Zegona') for the sale of Vodafone Holdings Europe, S.L.U.

The sale supports the new strategic direction of the Group and is subject to regulatory clearance.\n\n## Key steps to date\n\n- -December 2023: we reiterated that Vodafone is supportive of in-market consolidation in countries where appropriate returns on invested capital are not being achieved and confirmed that options with several parties were being explored to achieve this in Italy; -February 2024: we announced that Vodafone was in exclusive discussions with Swisscom regarding a potential sale of Vodafone Italy to Swisscom; and -final step in the reshaping of the Group's\n- March 2024: we announced that a binding agreement had been entered into with Swisscom for the sale of Vodafone Italy.

The objectives of the review were to provide an assessment of:\n\n- -Vodafone Group's Board effectiveness and governance;\n- -The effectiveness of Vodafone Group's Committees; and\n- -The effectiveness of Directors individually, taking into account their preparation ahead of meetings, time commitment, independence and courage to challenge.\n\nThe structure of the evaluation was agreed to take a hybrid format, comprising self-assessment questionnaires for the Directors and one-on-one conversational meetings with the Chair. In a change from prior years, response was also sought from the Group General Counsel and Company Secretary to enable greater scrutiny and provide an additional review for consideration and reflection.\n\nWith strong regard to the provisions and principles outlined in the UK Corporate Governance Code 2018 and matters of specific importance to Vodafone, a tailored Board questionnaire consisting of 27 questions was compiled to gather and distil feedback on the following topics:\n\n- -Effectiveness;\n- -Skills, composition and diversity;\n- -Leadership (the appraisal of the Chair, led by the Senior Independent Director, was included here);\n- -Fundamentals of administration and process; and\n- -Board Committees.\n\nConversely, the one-on-one meetings between Directors and the Chair took a less structured form to enable Directors to lead on the topics of conversation and raise specific items and comments organically.\n\nThe Directors' responses were collated and a paper summarising the findings was presented to the Nominations and Governance Committee and the Board at their January 2024 meetings.\n\n## Board evaluation findings\n\nThe Board discussed the findings from the evaluation and was encouraged by the strengths identified. In particular, the Board agreed that:\n\n| Effectiveness   | The Board is very effective in working together as a cohesive unit and continues to improve following the changes made  during FY24.

Each individual Director's effectiveness of contribution was rated, asking the respondent to take into account preparation ahead of meetings, time commitment, independence and courage to challenge. The results proved very favourable, concluding that each Director continues to make a valuable contribution to Board meetings and to the meetings of the Committees on which they sit, as well as supporting the view that the Directors work effectively together to contribute to the Company's long-term success.\n\n## Board Committees\n\nEach of the Board's Committees were evaluated as part of the broader evaluation process under the final section of the self-assessment questionnaire. Questions covered the logistics, performance and effectiveness of Committees and their respective Chairs. The conclusions of this review were positive, with Committee members agreeing that the Committees were functioning effectively, with their respective Chairs encouraging open communication and meaningful participation. Key strengths of the Committees were highlighted, as were areas for improvement.",

The Committee oversees all matters relating to corporate governance and succession planning and makes recommendations to the Board as appropriate.\n\nChair\n\nJean-Fran\u00e7ois van Boxmeer\n\n## Members\n\nStephen A. Carter CBE\n\nMichel Demar\u00e9\n\nHatem Dowidar (appointed as a member on 19 February 2024) David Nish (appointed as a member on 25 July 2023)\n\nWith the exception of Hatem Dowidar, the Committee is comprised of independent Non-Executive Directors. The Committee had four scheduled meetings during the year and additional ad hoc meetings as required. The attendance at Committee meetings can be found on page 70.\n\n## Letter from Committee Chair\n\nOn behalf of the Board, I am pleased to present the Nominations and Governance Committee Report for the year ended 31 March 2024.\n\n## Group Chief Financial Officer - Luka Mucic\n\nLast year we reported that a key focus for the Committee was to appoint a Group Chief Financial Officer following our announcement that Margherita Della Valle had been appointed permanent Group Chief Executive Officer. The Committee formulated a detailed specification, taking into consideration the experience, technical knowledge and leadership characteristics required for the position of Group Chief Financial Officer. An internal review process was undertaken and Egon Zehnder, an independent external search firm, was also appointed to support the Committee with the search for suitable candidates. A list of potential candidates was provided to the Committee for their further consideration. Following interviews and further testing of the candidates' credentials, the Committee made a recommendation to the Board in July 2023. The Board approved the recommendation to appoint Luka Mucic as Group Chief Financial Officer with effect from 1 September 2023. Luka also joined the Executive Committee with effect from the same date and he chairs the Risk and Compliance Committee and the Capital Decision Board, which are sub-committees of the Executive Committee.\n\nLuka has a strong track record of international leadership, corporate repositioning and value creation, and we are pleased to welcome him to the Board as the Group undertakes its strategic transformation. Luka's appointment to the Board will be subject to shareholder approval at the 2024 AGM.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRead more on Luka's background on page 76 and onboarding on page 88\n\n## Board composition and succession planning\n\nThe Committee reviews the composition of the Board and its Committees, evaluating the balance of skills, experience, independence, knowledge and diversity requirements. It also monitors the length of tenure and skills of the Non-Executive Directors to assist with succession planning.\n\nDuring the year, Sir Crispin Davis, Dame Clara Furse and Valerie Gooding stepped down as Non-Executive Directors following the conclusion of the 2023 AGM. With effect from the same date, David Nish was appointed Senior Independent Director, Amparo Moraleda was appointed Remuneration Committee Chair and Delphine Ernotte Cunci and Christine Ramon were appointed Workforce Engagement Leads.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nClick or scan to watch our Non-Executive Directors explain their role: investors.vodafone.com/videos\n\nFollowing receipt of the necessary regulatory approvals, Hatem Dowidar, the CEO of e&, Vodafone\u0202s largest shareholder, joined the Board as a Non-Executive Director and member of the Nominations and Governance Committee on 19 February 2024. Hatem brings to the Board extensive experience within the telecommunications industry and has held senior positions across a range of companies in the Middle East, Africa and Europe.\n\nThe Committee is confident that the Board currently has the necessary mix of skills and experience to contribute to the Company's strategic objectives.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRead more about the details of the length of tenure of each Director and a summary of the skills and experience of the Non-Executive Directors on pages 70 and 76-78\n\n## Executive Committee changes, succession planning and talent pipeline\n\nThe Committee receives regular updates on succession planning and changes to the membership of the Executive Committee. During the year, the Committee discussed succession plans for executives below Board level, focusing on the strength, depth and diversity of the talent pipeline. A deep-dive assessment of the key leadership roles was also undertaken to ensure alignment with the new business strategy and operating model.\n\nWith effect from 1 April 2024, we made a number of changes to our Executive Committee. Ahmed Essam was appointed Executive Chairman Vodafone Germany and CEO European Markets. Serpil Timuray was appointed CEO Vodafone Investments, taking on responsibility for our investments. Philippe Rogge stood down from his role as CEO Vodafone Germany and as a member of the Group Executive Committee. Marcel de Groot was appointed CEO Vodafone Germany and Max Taylor was appointed CEO Vodafone UK. Both Marcel and Max report to Ahmed Essam and are not members of the Executive Committee.\n\nOn 16 April 2024, we announced that Marika Auramo had been appointed as CEO of Vodafone Business and a member of Vodafone's Executive Committee, with effect from 1 July 2024. Marika will take over from Giorgio Migliarina, who has successfully led Vodafone Business as interim CEO since Vinod Kumar's departure on 31 December 2023.\n\n## Governance\n\nThe Committee continues to review action taken to comply with the 2018 UK Corporate Governance Code (the \u0201Code\u0202) and other legal and regulatory obligations during the year. The Committee receives regular governance updates and is satisfied that Vodafone complied with the Code in full throughout the year.\n\n## Appointment process\n\nWhen considering the recruitment of new Directors, the Committee adopts a formal and transparent procedure, which takes into account the skills, knowledge and level of experience required as well as social mobility factors and diversity. To begin the appointment process, the Company engages with an external search consultancy, which it provides with a search specification. The consultancy then proposes a list of individuals with a diverse range of backgrounds and characteristics. The shortlisted candidates are interviewed by Committee members and they meet with the Group Chief Executive, Chair and Chief Human Resources Officer. A recommendation is made to the Board on the chosen candidate. Once a candidate is selected, appointment terms are drafted and agreed with the selected candidate.\n\nThe Committee recognises that it is important for the Board to anticipate and prepare for the future and to ensure that the skills, experience, knowledge and perspectives of individuals reflect the ongoing needs of the Group. Focus has renewed on succession planning at Board level in anticipation of upcoming scheduled retirements in 2025.",

        "page_content": "## Independence\n\nIn accordance with the Code, the independence of all the NonExecutive Directors was considered by the Committee. Following evaluation, with the exception of Hatem Dowidar, all Non-Executive Directors are considered independent, and they continue to make independent contributions and effectively challenge management.\n\nAll Non-Executive Directors have submitted themselves for election or re-election, as applicable, at the 2024 AGM.\n\nThe Executive Directors' service contracts and Non-Executive Directors' appointment letters are available for inspection at our registered office and at the 2024 Annual General Meeting.\n\n## Conflicts of interest\n\nThe Companies Act 2006 provides that directors have a duty to avoid a situation in which they have or may have a direct or indirect interest that conflicts or might conflict with the interests of the Company. This duty is in addition to the existing duty owed to the Company to disclose to the Board any interest in a transaction or arrangement under consideration by the Company.\n\nOur Directors must report any changes to their commitments to the Board, immediately notify the Company of actual or potential conflicts or a change in circumstances relating to an existing authorisation, and complete an annual conflicts questionnaire. Any conflicts or potential conflicts identified are considered and, where appropriate, authorised by the Board in accordance with the Company\u0202s Articles of Association. A register of authorised conflicts is also reviewed periodically.\n\nThe Committee is comfortable that it has adequate measures in place to effectively identify, manage and mitigate any actual or potential conflicts of interest so as not to compromise or override independent judgement.\n\n## Time commitment\n\nIn accordance with the Code, the Committee actively reviews the time commitments of the Board. All Directors are engaged in providing their external commitments to establish that they have sufficient time to meet their Board responsibilities. The Committee is satisfied that the Board does meet this requirement and all Directors provide constructive challenge and strategic guidance and hold management to account.\n\n## Board evaluation\n\nIn accordance with the Code, Vodafone conducts an annual evaluation of Board and Board Committee performance, which every Director engages in and which is facilitated by an independent third party at least once every three years. In FY24, an internal evaluation of the performance of the Board and Committees took place led by the Chair, with support from the Group General Counsel and Company Secretary.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Read more about the outcome of this Board evaluation on pages 84-85\n\n## Diversity targets - progress update\n\n## Roles and responsibilities\n\nThe terms of reference for the Nominations and Governance Committee set out the role and responsibilities of the Committee in further detail and are reviewed annually.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nClick to read the Committee's terms of reference:\n\nvodafone.com/board-committees\n\n## Key areas of focus for FY25\n\n- -Board and Committee composition, tenure and succession; and\n- -Senior leadership succession and onboarding.\n\n## Jean-Fran\u00e7ois van Boxmeer\n\nOn behalf of the Nominations and Governance Committee\n\n14 May 2024\n\n## Diversity\n\nThe Board diversity policy reinforces the ongoing commitment of the Board to supporting diversity and inclusion in the boardroom, in all its forms including age, gender, ethnicity, sexual orientation, disability and socio-economic background. The Committee acknowledges the significant role diversity and inclusion has on the effective functioning of the Board and its Committees and believes a diverse Board brings a broader perspective, which enables it to be better equipped to understand the views of our stakeholders as well as our shareholders in the decision-making process.\n\nThe Board diversity policy is kept under review to ensure the objectives remain appropriate and sufficiently stretching. We also continue to monitor requirements set by the Financial Conduct Authority, FTSE Women Leaders Review, NASDAQ listing rules and Parker Review in terms of gender and ethnic diversity. Vodafone acknowledges that these targets are not just an end goal, but rather steps towards a drive for further progress.\n\nWhilst the Board Diversity Policy specifically focuses on diversity at Board and Committee level, commitment to diversity at Vodafone extends beyond the Board to the Executive Committee, talent pipeline and global workforce. The Board supports management in their efforts to build a diverse organisation throughout the Group and is regularly apprised of progress on the key diversity areas of focus beyond the Board and Executive Committee. As at 31 March 2024, our Executive Committee has four positions held by women (33%) and 25% of the Executive Committee identifies as ethnically diverse. In the Senior Leadership Team, 37% of positions (from continuing operations) are held by women and 21% of the Senior Leadership Team (from continuing operations) identifies as ethnically diverse.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRead more on Senior Leadership Team diversity on page 19\n\nRead more about our workforce inclusion programmes on pages 17-18\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Target                                                                                                               | Progress                                                                                                                                                         |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| The Board aspires to meet and ultimately exceed the target  for at least 40% of Board positions to be held by women. | As at 31 March 2024, 42% of our Board identified as women.                                                                                                       |\n| That at least one of the positions of Chair, CEO, CFO or  Senior Independent Director is held by a woman.            | As at 31 March 2024 our Group Chief Executive Officer position is held by a  woman.                                                                              |\n| That at least one member of the Board is from a minority  ethnic background.                                         | As at 31 March 2024, we currently have two Board members from a minority  background, and we continually aspire to increase diverse representation on our Board. |\n\n## Board and executive management diversity\n\nPrepared in accordance with UK Listing Rule 9.8.6R(10) as at 31 March 2024 Gender identity or sex 1\n\n|                                 |   Number of Board members | Percentage of the Board   |   Number of senior positions on the  Board (CEO, CFO, SID and Chair) |   Number in executive  management | Percentage of executive  management   |\n|---------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|\n| Men                             |                         7 | 58%                       |                                                                    3 |                                 8 | 67%                                   |\n| Women                           |                         5 | 42%                       |                                                                    1 |                                 4 | 33%                                   |\n| Other categories                |                         0 | 0%                        |                                                                    0 |                                 0 | 0%                                    |\n| Not specified/prefer not to say |                         0 | 0%                        |                                                                    0 |                                 0 | 0%                                    |",

The data is used for statistical reporting purposes and is provided with consent. The data in the above tables is as at 31 March 2024, and there have been no changes in the period between then and the date of this report.\n\nWhilst we commit to diversity and inclusion in all its forms, all appointments are made on merit and objective criteria to ensure the appropriate mix of skills and experience on the Board, valuing the unique contribution that an individual will bring.\n\n## Director appointments and onboarding\n\n## Director appointments\n\nDetails of the appointments to the Board made during FY24 are described in the Nominations and Governance Committee Report on pages 86.\n\n## Onboarding process\n\nUpon appointment, each new Director receives a comprehensive and formal induction programmed tailored to their needs, experience and the requirements of the role. Consideration is also given to Committee appointments and the Group General Counsel and Company Secretary assists the Chair in designing and facilitating the individual programmes. Onboarding is crucial to ensuring that our Directors have a full understanding of all aspects of our business, including the Group's strategy, vision and values, to ensure they are able to contribute effectively to the Board. All Directors are also encouraged to attend site visits.\n\nLuka Mucic received a bespoke induction which focused on his responsibilities as Group Chief Financial Officer. In addition to\n\nmeetings with external advisers and stakeholders, Luka met with internal stakeholders responsible for the key business operations within his reporting line. His induction covered a range of topics including strategy, finance, commercial, legal and governance. Luka also attended teach-in sessions with the networks and digital teams.\n\nUpon joining the Board as Non-Executive Directors, Christine Ramon and Hatem Dowidar undertook a tailored onboarding programme covering a range of areas of the business including, strategy, finance, risk, and stakeholder matters. They also met with senior management from key business areas and functions, and received a briefing from our external advisers which included: Directors' duties; the Market Abuse Regulation; and listing and disclosure obligations. Prior to Hatem joining, Christine, alongside the Chair, attended a meeting with employees after the 2023 AGM in Newbury. She also met with employees during the Board site visit to the call centre in Stoke-onTrent.\n\nUpon appointment, all Directors receive a comprehensive induction pack which includes key background information on the Company, corporate governance guidance, and internal policies and codes.\n\n## Director development and training\n\nAs the external business environment in which the Group operates continues to evolve, it is crucial that our Directors' skills and knowledge are refreshed and updated regularly. The Chair has overall responsibility for ensuring that our Non-Executive Directors receive suitable ongoing training to enable each to remain an effective Board member. Individual training requirements are reviewed regularly and the Board is kept informed of training opportunities, including those offered by our external advisers.\n\nIn addition to individual tailored training, updates on corporate governance, legal and regulatory matters are also provided by way of briefing papers and presentations at Board meetings.",

During the year, the Committee completed a series of deep dive reviews of principal key risks and additional reviews with a focus on strategic transformation and cyber security.\n\nChair and financial expert David Nish\n\nMembers Michel Demar\u00e9 Deborah Kerr Christine Ramon\n\n## Key responsibilities\n\nThe responsibilities of the Committee are to:\n\n- -Monitor the integrity of the financial statements, including the review of significant financial reporting judgements;\n- -Monitor the Group's risk management system, review the principal risks and the management of those risks;\n- -Provide advice to the Board on whether the Annual Report is fair, balanced and understandable and on the appropriateness of the long-term viability statement;\n- -Review and monitor the external auditor's independence and objectivity and the effectiveness of the external audit;\n- -Review the system of internal financial control and compliance with section 404 of the US Sarbanes-Oxley Act;\n- -Review and provide advice to the Board on the approval of the Group's US Annual Report on Form 20-F; and\n- -Monitor the activities and review the effectiveness of the Internal Audit function.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nClick to read the Committee's terms of reference:\n\nvodafone.com/board-committees\n\n## Letter from the Committee Chair\n\nI am pleased to present our report as Chair of the Audit and Risk Committee. This report provides an overview of how the Committee operates, an insight into the Committee's activities during the year and its role in ensuring the integrity of the Group\u0202s published financial information and the effectiveness of its risk management, controls and related processes.\n\nThe Committee met five times during the year, which included a joint meeting with the ESG Committee. The attendance by members at Committee meetings can be seen on page 70. Each meeting agenda included a range of topics across the Committee's areas of responsibility:\n\n- -We undertook a programme of reviews across multiple business units, typically with a focus on the risk and control environment. This was performed with the CEO and CFO of the Other Europe markets cluster, the CEOs of Vodafone Germany, Vodafone UK, Vodafone Spain and Vodacom Group, the Chief Commercial Officer and CEO Vodafone Italy and the CFO of Vodafone Business;\n- -External cyber threats continue to be a principal risk for the Group. Accordingly, the Committee met with the Chief Technology Officer and Cyber Security, Technology Assurance and Strategy Director to review and challenge the cyber security strategy and undertook a deep dive review of this principal risk;\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- -We performed deep dive reviews on several other principal risks, including Supply chain disruption, Data management and privacy, Disintermediation and Adverse political and policy environment;\n- -At the September 2023 and March 2024 meetings, we considered the anticipated financial reporting matters impacting the half-year and year-end reporting. We also reviewed the half-year results announcement at our November meeting and this Annual Report and accompanying materials at our March and May meetings. Our work included reviews of the Strategic Report, goodwill impairment testing, taxation judgements, legal contingencies and the Company\u0202s work on going concern and the long-term viability statement.\n\nThe Committee recognises the importance of Environmental, Social and Governance ('ESG') topics and the evolving disclosure requirements in this area. During our joint meeting in May 2024, we challenged the disclosures included in this Annual Report and also the Group\u0202s ESG Addendum, which is available on our website.\n\nOur external auditor, Ernst & Young (\u0201EY\u0202), provides robust challenge to management and its independent view to the Committee on specific financial reporting judgements and the control environment.\n\n## David Nish\n\nOn behalf of the Audit and Risk Committee\n\n14 May 2024\n\n## Objective\n\nThe objective of the Committee is the provision of effective governance over the appropriateness of financial reporting of the Group, including the adequacy of related disclosures, the performance of both the Internal Audit function and the external auditor and oversight of the Group\u0202s systems of internal control, business risks and related compliance activities.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nClick or scan to watch the Chair of the Audit and Risk Committee explain his role: investors.vodafone.com/videos\n\n## Committee governance\n\nCommittee meetings normally take place the day before Board meetings. The Committee Chair reports to the Board, as a separate agenda item, on the activity of the Committee and matters of particular relevance. The Board has access to the Committee\u0202s papers and receives copies of the Committee minutes. The Committee regularly meets separately with the external auditor, the Group Chief Financial Officer, the Group Audit Director and the Group Head of Risk without others being present. The Chair also meets regularly with the external lead audit partner during the year, outside of the formal Committee process.\n\nThe Chair is designated as the financial expert on the Committee for the purposes of the US Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the 2018 UK Corporate Governance Code (\u0201Code\u0202). The Committee continues to have competence relevant to the sector in which the Group operates.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRead more about the skills and experience of Committee members on pages 76 to 79",

        "page_content": "## Fair, balanced and understandable\n\nThe Committee assessed whether the Annual Report, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Company\u0202s position and performance, business model and strategy. This assessment is supported by the Group\u0202s Disclosure Committee, which is chaired by the Group General Counsel and Company Secretary who briefs the Committee on the Disclosure Committee's work and findings.\n\nThe Committee reviewed the processes and controls that underpin the Annual Report\u0202s preparation, ensuring that all contributors and senior management are fully aware of the requirements and their responsibilities. This included the financial reporting responsibilities of the Directors under section 172 of the Companies Act 2006 to promote the success of the Company for the benefit of its members as well as considering the interests of other stakeholders that will have an impact on the Company's long-term success.\n\n## Area of focus\n\n## Actions taken\n\n## Portfolio changes\n\nThe Group announced the disposal of Vodafone Spain in October 2023 and the disposal of Vodafone Italy in March 2024. Vodafone Spain and Vodafone Italy are both material operating segments of the Group. Consequently, the results are reported as discontinued operations in the year, with comparative information in both the income statement and cash flow statement re-presented to reflect this classification.\n\nAt 31 March 2024, the Group awaits certain regulatory approvals for both transactions and therefore the assets and liabilities of Vodafone Spain and Vodafone Italy are presented as held for sale.\n\nSee note 7 'Discontinued operations and assets held for sale' in the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## India accounting matters\n\nThe disclosure and accounting judgements in relation to:\n\n- -The Group's conditional and capped obligations to make certain payments to Vodafone Idea Limited ('VIL') under a payment mechanism agreed at the time of the merger between Vodafone India and Idea Cellular in 2017; and\n- -The valuation of a mark-to-market derivative asset in relation to the Total Return Swap (\u0201TRS\u0202).\n\nSee note 22 'Capital and financial risk management' and note 29 'Contingent liabilities and legal proceedings' in the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Impairments\n\nJudgements in relation to impairment testing relate primarily to the assumptions underlying the calculation of the value in use of the Group's businesses, being the achievability of the long-term business plans and the macroeconomic and related valuation model assumptions.\n\nSee note 4 'Impairment losses' in the consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe Committee met with the Group Financial Controlling and Operations Director in March and May 2024 who outlined the key accounting and disclosure impacts in relation to the transactions in the consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe Committee reviewed the appropriateness of the Group's accounting judgements in relation to potential liabilities under the payment mechanism agreed with VIL.\n\nThe Committee also reviewed accounting judgements relating to the valuation of the TRS derivative asset.\n\nThese reviews occurred at the September 2023, November 2023, March 2024 and May 2024 Committee meetings.\n\nThe Committee met with the Group Head of Financial Planning & Analysis in November 2023 and May 2024 to discuss the impairment exercise undertaken and to challenge the appropriateness of assumptions made, including:\n\n- -Management's valuation methodology;\n- -The achievability of the Group's five-year business plans;\n- -The potential impacts of market factors on the Group's businesses and their business plans;\n- -The long-term growth assumed for the Group's businesses at the end of the plan period; and\n- -The discount rates assumed in the valuation of the Group's businesses.\n\nThe Committee reviewed an early draft of the Annual Report at its March meeting to enable input and comment. The review is performed in conjunction with the ESG Committee during the joint meeting in May, which also included the review of TCFD and ESG-related disclosures. The Committee also reviewed the results announcement, supported by the work of the Group\u0202s Disclosure Committee, which reviews and assesses the appropriateness of investor communications.\n\nThis work enabled the Committee to provide positive assurance to the Board to assist it in making the statement required by the Code.\n\n## Significant financial reporting judgements\n\nThe areas considered and actions taken by the Committee in relation to the 2024 consolidated financial statements are outlined below and overleaf. For each area, the Committee was satisfied with the accounting and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements.",

The Group routinely reviews FRC publications, the most relevant publications for the 2024 Annual Report being:\n\n- -Annual review of corporate reporting;\n- -Annual review of corporate governance reporting; and\n- -Thematic reviews on existing disclosure requirements for (i) IFRS 13 'Fair value measurement' and (ii) Climate-related metrics and targets.\n\nThe Group already complied with the majority of the recommendations and the 2024 Annual Report has been updated to adopt best practice where appropriate.\n\nWe reviewed the minimum standard for Audit Committees that was published by the FRC in May 2023. The Committee follows the working practices in the guidance with necessary disclosure provided in the Annual Report. Consequently, the guidance has not resulted in any substantive changes for the Committee.\n\nDraft regulations for new UK corporate reporting requirements were withdrawn by the UK Government in October 2023, and it was announced that simpler and more targeted reforms will be considered in the future. We continue to track developments in this area to ensure that we will be well placed to implement any changes, as applicable, in the years ahead.\n\nIn January 2024, the FRC published an updated UK Corporate Governance Code ('revised Code'). The implementation date will be the year ending 31 March 2026 for the Group, excluding the enhanced internal control requirements in the revised Code where implementation is required for the year ending 31 March 2027. The Committee will work with management to identify the scope of our material internal controls and the level of internal attestation work that will be performed in order to support the Board's declaration of effectiveness of the controls. We expect to leverage from our established controls programme, which underpins our existing US reporting obligations.\n\nIn January 2024, the US Securities and Exchange Commission ('SEC') raised a comment in relation to the commentary on our financial performance that was included in our Form 20-F for the year ended 31 March 2023. We submitted our written response to the SEC which was accepted, and their review was closed in January 2024. This review will result in a number of enhancements in our disclosures which will be included in our Form 20-F for the year ended 31 March 2024.\n\nStrategic report\n\nOther information",

        "page_content": "## Internal control and risk management\n\nThe Committee has the primary responsibility for the oversight of the Group's system of internal control, including the risk management framework, the compliance framework and the work of the Internal Audit function.\n\n## Internal Audit\n\nThe Internal Audit function provides independent and objective assurance over the design and operating effectiveness of the system of internal control, through a risk-based approach. The function reports into the Committee and, administratively, to the Chief Financial Officer. The function is composed of teams across Group functions and local markets. This enables access to specialist skills through centres of excellence and ensures local knowledge and experience. Cooperation with professional bodies and an information technology research firm has ensured access to additional specialist skills and an advanced knowledge base.\n\nInternal Audit activities are based on a robust methodology and the internal quality assurance improvement programme ensures conformity with the International Professional Practices framework, which includes the IIA standards and code of ethics and the continuous development of the audit methodology applied. The conformity is reviewed and verified through an external quality assessment by an independent consultancy firm every three years.\n\nThe Committee has a standing agenda item to cover Internal Audit-related topics. Prior to the start of each financial year, the Committee reviews and approves the annual audit plan, assesses the adequacy of the budget and resources and reviews the strategic initiatives for the continuous improvement of the function's effectiveness. The audit plan is determined by considering Internal Audit's rolling review framework and the outputs of a data-driven risk assessment.\n\nThe Committee reviews progress against the approved audit plan and the results of Internal Audit activities, with a strong focus on unsatisfactory audit results and cross-entity audits, which are audits that are performed across multiple markets with the same scope. Audit results are analysed by process and entity to highlight both changes in the control environment and areas that require attention.\n\nDuring the year, Internal Audit coverage focused on principal risks, including Cyber threat, Data management and privacy and Adverse macro-economic conditions.\n\nThrough the thematic reviews, assurance was provided across a broad range of areas, including: customer device financing; discount management; Vodafone Business billing processes; M-Pesa operations; security of enterprise customer-provided equipment ('CPE'); management of end-of-life software risks; identity management; shadow IT; management of network stock; management of payment systems; data privacy; management of customer master data; and the physical security of critical assets. The activities performed by the shared service organisation continue to receive ongoing focus due to their significance across many processes.\n\nManagement is responsible for ensuring that issues raised by Internal Audit are addressed within an agreed timetable, and the Committee reviews their timely completion.\n\nThe last independent review of the effectiveness of the Group's Internal Audit function was performed by Deloitte LLP in January 2022, and the results were presented to the Committee. The review concluded that the Internal Audit function operated in accordance with the Global Institute of Internal Auditors' International Professional Practices Framework, is at the top of its peer group range and demonstrates areas of innovative practice.\n\nThe Internal Audit function continues to invest in several initiatives to improve its effectiveness, particularly in the adoption of new technologies. The innovative use of data analytics has provided broader and deeper audit testing and driven increased insights.\n\n## Assessment of the Group's system of internal control, including the risk management framework\n\nThe Group's risk assessment process and the way in which significant business risks are managed is an area of focus for the Committee. The Committee\u0202s activity here was led primarily, but not solely, by the Group\u0202s assessment of its principal and emerging risks and uncertainties. Cyber threats remain a major focus for the Committee given the continual threats in this area.\n\nThe Group has an internal control environment designed to protect the business from the material risks that have been identified. Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal controls and the Committee has responsibility for ensuring the effectiveness of those controls.\n\nThe Committee reviewed the process by which Group management assessed the control environment, in accordance with the requirements of the Guidance on Risk Management, Internal Control and Related Financial and Business Reporting published by the FRC. This activity was supported by (i) reports from the Group Audit Director, (ii) a review of the Group's principal risks with the Global Head of Risk, (iii) a review of the Group's second line of defence and policy simplification with the Group General Counsel and Company Secretary, and (iv) a fraud update from the Global Corporate Security and Resilience Director and Global Head of Fraud Management and Investigations.\n\nThe Group operates a 'Speak Up' channel that enables employees to anonymously raise concerns about possible irregularities. The Committee received an update on the operation of the channel together with the output of any resulting investigations.\n\nThe Committee has completed its review of the effectiveness of the Group's system of internal control, including risk management, during the year and up to the date of this Annual Report. The review covered all material controls including financial, operating and compliance controls. The Committee confirms that the system of internal control operated effectively for the 2024 financial year. Where specific areas for improvement were identified, mitigating alternative controls and processes were in place. This allows us to provide positive assurance to the Board to help fulfil its obligations under the Code.\n\nCompliance with section 404 of the US Sarbanes-Oxley Act Oversight of the Group's compliance activities in relation to section 404 of the US Sarbanes-Oxley Act and policy compliance reviews also fall within the Committee's remit.\n\nManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal controls over financial reporting, and we have responsibility for ensuring the effectiveness of these controls. The Committee received updates on the Group's work in relation to section 404 compliance and the Group's broader financial control environment during the year. We continue to challenge management on ensuring the nature and scope of control activities evolve to ensure key risks continue to be adequately mitigated.\n\nThe Committee also took an active role in monitoring the Group's compliance activities, including receiving reports from management in the year covering programme-level strategy, the scope of compliance work performed and the results of controls testing. The external auditor also reports the status of its work in relation to controls in its reports to the Committee.",

        "page_content": "## Governance (continued)\n\n## Long-term viability statement and going concern assessment\n\nThe Committee provides advice to the Board on the form and basis of conclusion underlying the long-term viability statement and the going concern assessment.\n\nRead more about the long-term viability statement on page 63\n\nRead more about the going concern assessment on page 124\n\nAt our meeting in May 2024, the Committee challenged management on its financial risk assessment as part of its consideration of the long-term viability statement. This included scrutiny of forecast liquidity, balance sheet stress tests, the availability of cash and cash equivalents through new or existing financing facilities and a review of counter-party risk to assess the likelihood of third parties not being able to meet contractual obligations. This comprehensive assessment of the Group's prospects made by management included consideration of:\n\n- -The review period and alignment with the Group's internal long-term forecasts;\n- -The assessment of the capacity of the Group to remain viable after consideration of future cash flows, expected debt service requirements, undrawn facilities and access to capital markets;\n- -The modelling of the financial impact of severe but plausible risk scenarios materialising; including a sensitivity if expected M&A transactions fail to complete within the assessment period;\n- -The inclusion of clear and enhanced disclosures in the Annual Report as to why the assessment period selected was appropriate to the Group, what qualifications and assumptions were made and how the underlying analysis was performed, consistent with FRC pronouncements; and\n- -Comprehensive disclosure in relation to the Group's liquidity provided in the consolidated financial statements. See note 22 'Capital and financial risk management' in the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## External audit\n\nThe Committee has primary responsibility for overseeing the relationship with the external auditor, EY. This includes making the recommendation on the appointment, reappointment and removal of the external auditor, assessing its independence on an ongoing basis, and approving the statutory audit fee, the scope of the statutory audit and the appointment of the lead audit engagement partner. Alison Duncan has held this role for five years since the appointment of EY as external auditor for the year ended 31 March 2020. The lead audit partner role will rotate to Michael Rudberg, an existing partner on the audit team, for the year ending 31 March 2025.\n\nEY presented to the Committee its detailed audit plan for the 2024 financial year, which outlined its audit scope, planning materiality and its assessment of key audit risks. The identification of key audit risks is critical in the overall effectiveness of the external audit process and these are outlined in the Auditor's report.\n\nThe Committee also received reports from EY on its assessment of the accounting and disclosures in the financial statements and financial controls.\n\nThe last external audit tender took place in 2019, which resulted in the appointment of EY. The Committee will continue to review the auditor appointment and anticipates that the audit will be put out to tender at least every 10 years. In deciding when to conduct an external audit tender, the Committee considers a range of factors, including the potential cost and efficiency benefits of retaining the incumbent auditor. The Company has complied with the Statutory Audit Services Order 2014 for the financial year under review.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Independence and objectivity\n\nIn its assessment of the independence of the auditor, and in accordance with the US Public Company Accounting Oversight Board's ('PCAOB') standard on independence, the Committee received details of all relationships between the Company and EY that may have a bearing on its independence and received confirmation from EY that it is independent of the Company in accordance with US federal securities law and the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC and the PCAOB.\n\n## Effectiveness of the external audit process\n\nThe Committee reviewed the quality of the external audit process throughout the year and considered the performance of EY. on these reviews, the Committee concluded that there had been appropriate focus and challenge by EY on the primary areas of the audit and that EY had applied robust challenge and scepticism\n\nThis comprised the Committee\u0202s own assessment and the results of a detailed feedback survey of senior personnel across the Group. Based throughout the audit.\n\n## EY audit and non-audit fees\n\nTotal fees payable to EY for audit and non-audit services in the year ended 31 March 2024 amounted to \u20ac36 million (FY23: \u20ac31 million).\n\n## Audit fees\n\nThe Committee reviewed and discussed the fee proposal, was engaged in agreeing audit scope changes and, following the receipt of formal assurance that its fees were appropriate for the scope of the work required, agreed an audit fee of \u20ac26 million for statutory audit services in the year (FY23: \u20ac28 million).\n\n## Non-audit fees\n\nTo protect the independence and objectivity of the external auditor, the Committee has a policy for the engagement of the external auditor to provide non-audit services. The policy prohibits EY from playing any part in management or decision-making, providing certain services such as valuation work and the provision of accounting services. The Group's non-audit services policy incorporates the requirements of the FRC's Ethical Standard, including a 'whitelist' of permitted non-audit services which mirrors the FRC's Ethical Standard.\n\nThe FRC published a revised Ethical Standard in January 2024. The Group's non-audit services policy will be updated to incorporate the changes in the revised Ethical Standard and will be approved by the Committee ahead of the December 2024 effective date.\n\nThe Committee has pre-approved that EY can be engaged by management, subject to the policies set out above, and subject to:\n\n- -A \u20ac60,000 fee limit for individual engagements;\n- -A \u20ac500,000 total fee limit for services where there is no legal alternative; and\n- -A \u20ac500,000 total fee limit for services where there is no practical alternative supplier.\n\nFor those permitted services that exceed these specified fee limits, the Committee Chair pre-approves the service.\n\nNon-audit fees were \u20ac10 million (FY23: \u20ac3 million). The level of non-audit fees in the year ended 31 March 2024 is significantly higher than recent years. This is primarily attributable to Reporting Accountant services that have been provided by EY in connection with the proposed merger of Vodafone UK with Three UK and other audit-related services associated with the disposal of Vodafone Spain.

Furthermore, topics reviewed during Committee meetings in 2023/2024 on key areas such as future network strategy, Internet of Things ecosystem, Artificial Intelligence ('AI') and how technology strategy underpins the company strategy, have enabled Committee members to lead and support broader technical discussions with the main Plc Board.\n\nI have reported this year's Committee work to the Board and I am looking forward to the next year chairing the Committee, starting with the next meeting in May 2024.\n\n## Simon Segars\n\nOn behalf of the Technology Committee\n\n14 May 2024\n\nClick or scan to watch the Chair of the Technology Committee explain his role: investors.vodafone.com/videos\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Focus during the year\n\nThe Technology Committee met with senior leaders of the technology team including the Chief Technology Officer, Chief Network Officer and others on three occasions during the year ended 31 March 2024. The following provides a summary of the topics covered.\n\n## July 2023\n\nIn the first meeting the proposed terms of reference were reviewed and approved. The objective of this session was to set the foundation and context for future discussion and deep dive topics that directly support Vodafone's technology strategy and vision.\n\nVodafone's approach to technology strategy development and its operating model were explained.\n\nThe Committee discussed Vodafone's five-year technology strategy and individual workstreams. 5G network deployment and the development of global platforms were particular areas of focus. Cyber security was also discussed, with the Committee reflecting on the changing business, technology, and threat landscape.\n\n## November 2023\n\nThis session included deep dives on a range of topics including the prioritisation process that drives execution of the technology strategy and its links to the company's annual planning cycle.\n\nWe discussed how strategy and plans are shaped to address regulatory changes, macro-economic and geopolitical factors.\n\nA digital and IT presentation focused on customer experience and service as well as global platforms.\n\n## January 2024\n\nIn January this year, we explored how the technology team is supporting Vodafone Business' growth ambitions over the next five years, including target outcomes. Our IoT portfolio and underlying technologies were also discussed, including the future investment roadmap for key products.\n\nPriorities, delivery targets and outcomes for FY25 were discussed with the Committee with focus on direct contribution to company priorities around Customer, Simplicity and Growth.\n\nFinally, the Committee were briefed on Vodafone's AI, Machine Learning and Generative AI capabilities and partnerships ahead of a deep dive scheduled for May 2024.\n\n## Key focus for the next year\n\nNext year we expect to continue to look at existing and new technologies that drive innovation, company strategy and growth, focusing on how technology enables customer service and builds trust. Strategy discussions will consider how we manage both opportunities and risks.",

The role of the Committee is to provide oversight of Vodafone's Environmental, Social and Governance ('ESG') programme, to monitor the Purpose agenda in relation to Empowering People, Protecting the Planet and ensuring that Vodafone Maintains Trust.\n\n## Chair\n\nAmparo Moraleda\n\nMembers Jean-Fran\u00e7ois van Boxmeer Christine Ramon Simon Segars\n\n## Key responsibilities\n\nThe responsibilities of the Committee are to:\n\n- -Provide oversight of the Vodafone Group ESG programme and monitor the Purpose agenda;\n- -Review and provide guidance on the implementation of the ESG strategy, and related policies and programmes required to implement the ESG strategy;\n- -Monitor progress against KPIs and external ESG indices; and\n- -Provide joint oversight and effective governance with the Audit and Risk Committee ('ARC') over the ESG content within the Annual Report, the ESG Addendum and other disclosures with ESG content.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nClick to read the Committee's terms of reference:\n\nvodafone.com/board-committees\n\n## Letter from Committee Chair\n\nOn behalf of the Board, I am pleased to present Vodafone's ESG Committee report for the year ended 31 March 2024.\n\nOn establishment of the Committee in 2021, I was appointed as Chair due to my experience in ESG topics and my tenure as a member of the Board of Trustees of the Vodafone Foundation since 2020. In November 2022, we were delighted to welcome a new Committee member, Simon Segars, who brings a wealth of experience from his career in the electrical engineering field to the Vodafone Board and the ESG Committee. In 2023, the Committee underwent a substantial change to its structure, as two of my fellow founding members, Dame Clara Furse and Valerie Gooding, retired from the Committee after building a strong foundation from which our new members will drive the strategy to the next phase.\n\nTo emphasise ESG as a strategic priority, our Board Chair, JeanFran\u00e7ois van Boxmeer, joined the ESG Committee, in addition to his role on the Nominations and Governance Committee. Jean-Fran\u00e7ois was Chief Executive of Heineken for 15 years and provides important perspectives having held senior roles across Africa and Europe before becoming Chair of the Vodafone Board in 2020.\n\nChristine Ramon completes the ESG Committee. Her extensive experience in senior finance roles, specifically at AngloGold Ashanti, energy and chemicals company Sasol, and as non-executive director at telecommunications company MTN Group Ltd, both in South Africa, offer invaluable insights to many markets in which Vodafone operates. Her position on the ARC ensures that where ESG concepts converge with risk and compliance topics, we can take an integrated approach.\n\nIn FY23, the Board took the decision to evolve ESG governance and increase the cadence of ESG Committee meetings to three per annum. This additional engagement is a joint session with the ARC, to stay ahead of the constantly changing ESG landscape, ensure a\n\nholistic perspective on the issues that impact both committees and implement additional controls on disclosures, within the Annual Report and the ESG Addendum and Methodology document, for which we have introduced a collaborative responsibility.\n\nThe other two Committee meetings in FY23 ensured further development of the relationships with the senior leaders who lead the Purpose agenda, drive the strategies to deliver against the KPIs and engage Vodafone employees in supporting positive change in all ESG areas. The wide variety of topics and thorough papers ensured a comprehensive view of the ESG programmes. Deep dives with subject matter experts were conducted to develop detailed knowledge on specific strategies, KPIs and progress against them along with discussions around future direction.\n\nMultiple discussions with Joakim Reiter, Chief External and Corporate Affairs Officer, have reinforced that ESG is at the core of Vodafone's purpose and is a key element in the execution of the corporate strategy, as well as a driver of commercial success. The approach to ESG brings together five key programmes:\n\n- -Purpose and the actions Vodafone takes within our Purpose strategy relating to Empowering People, Protecting the Planet and Maintaining Trust;\n- -Oversight of Vodafone's ESG strategy and performance to ensure an effective ESG programme;\n- -Conducting business with integrity , to ensure Vodafone operates to the highest possible standards of integrity and ethics, and that Vodafone is 'Doing What's Right' towards customers, colleagues, communities and co-partners;\n- -Transparency , including providing correct disclosures and reporting, as well as external positioning, engagement and communication on all material ESG aspects; and\n- -Measurement , ensuring that the data that we use to track progress on ESG metrics is of high quality and reliable, to provide insights for strategic focus.\n\nThe transformation programme to move ESG data reporting to the finance function continues to evolve and support the delivery of substantial improvements in our non-financial data through the development of a robust control environment, alongside policies, to progress our ESG objectives.\n\nOn behalf of the Committee, I have reported on the FY24 work to the Board, and I am looking forward to FY25; starting with the joint ESG and ARC Committee meeting in May 2024 to review annual reporting.\n\nThe Committee will continue oversight and scrutiny of Vodafone's ESG agenda, including further presentations from senior executives and experts from across the Group. We will review progress on each of Vodafone's ESG strategies and the pathways in place to meet our ESG goals in Group and across markets. Consideration of the following stakeholder interests will remain part of the Committee's responsibility:\n\n- -Investors: Strong Board-level ESG governance is a key requirement of an effective ESG programme;\n- -Governments and regulators: Local and international legal and regulatory obligations on ESG topics continue to increase;\n- -Local communities and NGOs: ESG topics affect the day-to-day lives of the people in the communities that we serve;\n- -Suppliers and customers : Upholding high ethical standards throughout our value chain is critical for stakeholders when deciding whether they should do business with Vodafone; and\n- -Employees take pride in working for a purpose-driven organisation that is enabling an inclusive, sustainable and trusted digital society.\n\n## Amparo Moraleda\n\nOn behalf of the ESG Committee\n\n14 May 2024",

The following provides a summary of the topics covered.\n\n## May 2023\n\nThe inaugural joint ARC and ESG Committee provided a full review of all ESG annual reporting documents, including the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures ('TCFD') report and the ESG Addendum. The Committees received papers outlining key changes made since the previous annual report, including the strategic approach and the scope of the assurance plan. The Committees were satisfied with the proposals.\n\n## November 2023\n\n- -Review of the ESG strategy and its evolution since the establishment of the Committee in 2021. The paper submitted by Joakim Reiter, Chief External and Corporate Affairs Officer, provided details on three key strategic evolutions prompted either by changes in Vodafone Group or developments in the external environment: simplification of ESG targets, integration of ESG into business priorities, and the continued evolution of ESG data management.\n- -The Executive Committee sponsor of Vodafone's inclusion programme, Serpil Timuray, CEO of Vodafone Investments, provided an overview of the strategy and a progress update on KPIs in relation to customers, communities, colleagues and co-partners.\n- -Leanne Wood, Chief Human Resources Officer, presented feedback from Vodafone's female employees on the gender diversity programme, the achievements to date and the actions planned to further improve the gender diversity programme.\n- -The Committee was also assured by the papers submitted on ESG rankings and indices and the approach to ESG half-year reporting.\n\n## March 2024\n\nJoakim Reiter, delivered key ESG developments at the March Committee:\n\n- -Vodafone's purpose was refreshed to reflect that everything we do in Vodafone aims to create a digital society, and we ensure that this digital society is inclusive, sustainable and responsible through three purpose differentiators: Empowering People, Protecting the Planet and Maintaining Trust.\n- -The Committee welcomed the opportunity to review Vodafone's Climate Transition Plan, which details the necessary actions to achieve our net zero ambitions. This will be published as part of our FY24 reporting suite, and is a summary of our strategy with cross-functional objectives and governance to reduce emissions and manage our climate-related risks and opportunities.\n- -Vodafone's approach to ESG reporting for FY24 was noted in a paper along with the results from a recent internal audit that reviewed: ESG global targets; policies and procedures; implementation and monitoring of programmes; local metrics calculation and reporting; and Group consolidation and disclosures.\n\n## Key focus for the next year\n\n- -Continuing to review progress of the ESG strategy, including performance against targets and performance in ESG indices and rankings;\n- -Reviewing progress in embedding key purpose targets and practices into Vodafone's operations and commercial strategy;\n- -Reviewing Vodafone's alignment to external ESG disclosure standards such as ISRS 1 , CSRD 2 and ESRS 3 ; and\n- -Continued oversight of the ESG data management programme.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nClick or scan to watch the Chair of the ESG Committee explain her role: investors.vodafone.com/videos\n\n## Notes:\n\n- 1.

        "page_content": "## Remuneration Committee\n\n## Letter from the Remuneration Committee Chair\n\n## On behalf of the Board, I present our 2024 Directors' Remuneration Report.\n\nThis report includes both our Policy Report (as approved by shareholders at the 2023 AGM), and our 2024 Annual Report on Remuneration, which sets out how our policy was implemented during the year under review and how it will be applied for the year ahead.\n\n## Activities during the year\n\nIn the last year we have seen good progress in delivering against our strategic goals of Customers, Simplicity, and Growth, and in transforming our company to support these ambitions. We recognise how important it is to stay connected with our employees during this period of change, and as a result continue to collect feedback through our Spirit Beat survey and other employee listening initiatives. Our workforce engagement leads, Christine Ramon and Delphine Ernotte Cunci, have also attended forums in Europe and Africa to understand the perspectives of employees across all our markets. The key topics raised by employee representatives this year included our company transformation, market portfolio, the development of our employees, and the experience of our customers.\n\nAs set out in last year's letter, we launched our remuneration policy consultation with our largest shareholders last year and engaged with a variety of investor bodies and proxy agencies. We were pleased to see that our Policy Report was approved by over 95% of shareholders at the 2023 AGM. The Committee would like to thank those that provided feedback leading up to this and we continue to engage with investors on the implementation of our 2024 Annual Report on Remuneration.\n\n## Alignment with our strategy and culture\n\nDuring the year we made announcements regarding the sale of Vodafone Spain and Vodafone Italy and outlined the binding agreement to combine our UK business. These reflect the advancements we have made in right-sizing our European portfolio for optimal growth. We also made good early progress with improving the experience of customers and transforming our operations to remove complexity and accelerate growth.\n\nTo support and reinforce these priorities, we updated the structure of our Global Short Term Incentive plan to categorise measures under Growth and Customers. In the case of the latter, we split out our NPS, Churn and Revenue Market Share metrics into separate measures, following the previous approach of categorising these under a single Customer Appreciation metric. This has ensured dedicated focus, and, in the case of NPS, where we specifically review the reduction of deep detractor customers, we have seen a reduction in a majority of our markets.\n\nWe continue to use adjusted free cash flow across our incentive plans to reinforce the importance of cash generation in creating value for our business and when applying rigorous capital discipline in investment decisions. We also use adjusted service revenue and adjusted EBIT in our Global Short Term Incentive plan to focus on the importance of delivering operating efficiencies when maximising profit and revenue.\n\nThe Committee evaluates the remuneration decisions, outcomes, and structures in the context of our evolving company strategy, and this will inform any changes to our Policy Report which will be reviewed in the forthcoming year.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Fair pay\n\nDuring the year we continued to make interventions across our business to support our colleagues in countries where inflationary and cost of living pressures were being felt. This included targeted support in markets including, but not limited to, Germany, Ireland, Egypt, and Turkey. The type of support used was tailored to specific market circumstances but included additional or accelerated salary reviews and the provision of extra cash allowances.\n\nWhen making decisions on executive remuneration the Committee considers pay in the wider context including arrangements elsewhere in the business, our fair pay principles and stakeholder considerations.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRead more\n\non page 113\n\n## Arrangements for 2025\n\n## Base salary and pension arrangements\n\nPrior to the 2024 review, the salaries for both Executive Directors had been unchanged following their respective appointments to the roles of Group Chief Executive and Group Chief Financial Officer.\n\nFollowing the 2024 salary review, the Committee agreed that salaries for both Executive Directors would remain unchanged. The Committee felt this was appropriate considering Margherita Della Valle\u0202s salary increase following her permanent appointment as Group Chief Executive in April 2023, and given Luka Mucic\u0202s salary was set appropriately when he joined as Chief Financial Officer in September 2023.\n\nPension arrangements for Executive Directors will continue to remain aligned with the wider UK workforce at 10% of base salary.\n\n## Annual bonus ('GSTIP')\n\nDuring the year the Committee determined that measures and weighting under the 2025 annual bonus will remain unchanged from those used in the 2024 plan:\n\n- -Growth (70%) : service revenue (20%), adjusted EBIT (20%), adjusted free cash flow (20%) and revenue market share (10%).\n- -Customers (30%) : Net Promoter Score (20%) and churn (10%).\n\n## Global long-term incentive (\u0201GLTI\u0202)\n\nThe Committee determined that the GLTI will remain unchanged for 2025. The measures under the long-term incentive will continue to be weighted at 60% adjusted free cash flow, 30% relative TSR and 10% ESG.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRead more on pages 117 to 118\n\n## Performance outcomes during 2024\n\nGSTIP performance (1 April 2023 - 31 March 2024) Annual bonus performance during the year was measured against both financial and strategic measures aligned to our strategic priorities of Growth and Customers. The four measures underpinning Growth, equivalent to 70% of the award, include service revenue (20%), adjusted EBIT (20%), adjusted free cash flow (20%), and revenue market share (10%). The measures under the Customers element of the award, equivalent to 30% of the award, include Net Promoter Score (20%) and Churn (10%).\n\nPerformance under the financial and strategic measures was consistent with or above the mid-point of the target range. The combined performance resulted in an overall bonus payout of 71.2% of maximum.\n\n<!-- image -->",

All performance conditions were measured over the three-year period ending 31 March 2024.\n\nFinal adjusted FCF performance finished above the mid-point of the range resulting in 65.3% of the adjusted FCF element vesting. Relative TSR performance was below the median of the peer group resulting in no vesting under this measure. ESG performance was assessed against three metrics and vested at 96.9%.

The Committee also acknowledged that no windfall gains had occurred under the long-term incentive plan. It was agreed that the outcomes were appropriate and that no adjustments were required.\n\n## Looking ahead\n\nOver the course of the next 12 months the Committee will be reviewing the current Remuneration Policy to ensure it continues to support our Company strategy.

Our approved Policy Report is available on our website at vodafone.com, and has been reproduced below in the shaded boxes exactly as it was set out in the 2023 Annual Report. As such some of the policy wording, including references to the 2023 Annual General Meeting and page number references, is now out of date.\n\n## Remuneration Policy\n\nIn this forward-looking section we describe our Remuneration Policy for the Board. This includes our considerations when determining policy, a description of the elements of the reward package, including an indication of the potential future value of this package for the Executive Directors, and the policy applied to the Chair and Non-Executive Directors.\n\nWe will be seeking shareholder approval for our Remuneration Policy at the 2023 Annual General Meeting ('AGM') and we intend to implement it at that point. A summary and explanation of the proposed changes to the current Remuneration Policy is provided on page 85. The proposed Remuneration Policy submitted for shareholders' approval at the 2023 AGM does not differ substantively from the Remuneration Policy approved by shareholders in 2020 except for changes made to align the terms of the Remuneration Policy with the drafting of the rules of the new Global Incentive Plan 2023, which is also being submitted for shareholders' approval at the 2023 AGM. Subject to approval, we will review our Remuneration Policy each year to ensure that it continues to support our Company strategy and, if it is necessary to make a change to our Remuneration Policy within the next three years, we will seek prior shareholder approval for the change.\n\n## Considerations when determining our Remuneration Policy\n\nTo avoid conflicts of interest, the Remuneration Committee is entirely comprised of Non-Executive Directors (who are not eligible to participate in the Company's annual bonus or long-term incentive arrangements) and the Remuneration Committee ensures that individuals are not present when the Remuneration Committee discusses their own remuneration. A critical consideration for the Remuneration Committee when determining our Remuneration Policy is to ensure that it supports our Company purpose, strategy, and business objectives.\n\nA variety of stakeholder views are taken into account when determining executive pay, including those of our shareholders, colleagues, and external bodies. Further details of how we engage with, and consider the views of, each of these stakeholders are set out on page 100.\n\nIn advance of submitting our Remuneration Policy for shareholder approval we ran a thorough consultation exercise with our major shareholders. We invited our top 25 shareholders (constituting a combined holding of c.50% of our issued share capital at the time of engagement) and a number of key governance stakeholders to comment on remuneration at Vodafone and to provide feedback on the proposed changes to the current Remuneration Policy which was approved at the 2020 AGM. A number of meetings between shareholders and the Remuneration Committee Chair took place during this consultation period.\n\nListening to and consulting with our employees is very important and the Remuneration Committee is supportive of the activities undertaken to engage the employee voice. Our engagement with employees can take different forms in different markets but includes a variety of channels and approaches including our annual people survey which attracts very high levels of participation and engagement, regular business leader Q&A sessions, and a number of internal digital communication platforms.\n\nOur Workforce Engagement Lead also undertakes an annual attendance at our European employee forum, and a similar body which covers our African markets, with any questions or concerns raised by the employee representatives presented directly to the Board for consideration and discussion. Any actions taken by the Board are then fed back to these forums to ensure a two-way dialogue.\n\nWhilst we do not formally consult directly with employees on the Remuneration Policy nor is any fixed remuneration comparison measurement used when determining the Remuneration Policy for Executive Directors, the Remuneration Committee is briefed on pay and employment conditions of employees in the Vodafone Group, with particular reference to the market in which the executive is based. The Company operates Sharesave, a UK all-employee share plan, as well as other discretionary share-based incentive arrangements, which means that the wider workforce have the opportunity to become shareholders in the Company and be able to vote on the Remuneration Policy in the same way as other shareholders. Further information on our approach to remuneration for other employees is given on page 90.\n\n## Performance measures and targets\n\nOur Company strategy and business objectives are the primary consideration when we are selecting performance measures for our incentive plans. The targets within our incentive plans that are related to internal financial measures (such as revenue, profit and cash flow) are typically determined based on our budgets. Targets for strategic and external measures (such as customer-focused metrics, ESG measures, and total shareholder return ('TSR')) are set based on Company objectives and in light of the competitive marketplace. The threshold and maximum levels of performance are set to reflect minimum acceptable levels at threshold and very stretching levels at maximum.\n\nAs in previous Remuneration Reports, we will disclose the details of our performance metrics for our short- and long-term incentive plans. However, our annual bonus targets are commercially sensitive and therefore we will only disclose our targets in the Remuneration Report following the completion of the financial year. We will normally disclose the targets for each long-term award in the Remuneration Report for the financial year preceding the start of the performance period.\n\nAt the end of each performance period we review performance against the targets, using judgement to account for items such as (but not limited to) mergers, acquisitions, disposals, foreign exchange rate movements, changes in accounting treatment, material one-off tax settlements etc. The application of judgement is important to ensure that the final assessments of performance are fair and appropriate.",

        "page_content": "## Malus and clawback\n\nThe Remuneration Committee reviews the incentive plan results before any payments are made to executives or any shares vest and has full discretion to adjust the final payment or vesting if they believe circumstances warrant it. In particular, the Remuneration Committee has the discretion to use either malus or clawback as it sees appropriate. In the case of malus, the award may lapse wholly or in part, may vest to a lesser extent than it would otherwise have vested or vesting may be delayed.\n\nIn the case of clawback, the Remuneration Committee may recover bonus amounts that have been paid up to three years after the relevant payment date, or recover share awards that have vested up to five years after the relevant grant date. In line with best practice guidance, the key trigger events for the use of the clawback arrangements include material misstatement of results, material miscalculation of performance condition outcomes, the Executive Director's gross misconduct, or breach of their restrictive covenants, the Executive Director causing a material financial loss to the Group as a result of reckless or negligent conduct or inappropriate values or behaviour, corporate failure or serious reputational damage.\n\nSubject to approval of this Remuneration Policy, these arrangements will be applicable to all bonus amounts paid, or share awards granted, following the 2023 AGM. The current clawback arrangements, which are set out in the Remuneration Policy approved by shareholders at the 2020 AGM, have been applicable to all bonus amounts paid, or share awards granted, since the 2020 AGM.\n\n## The Remuneration Policy table\n\nThe table below summarises the main components of the reward package for Executive Directors.\n\n| Fixed pay:  Base salary                       | Fixed pay:  Base salary                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n|-----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Purpose and link                              | To attract and retain the best talent                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n| Operation                                     | Salaries are usually reviewed annually and fixed for 12 months commencing 1 July.

For the avoidance of doubt this includes payments in respect of any award granted under any previous Remuneration Policy. This will last until the existing incentives vest (or lapse) or the benefits or contractual arrangements no longer apply.\n\n## Long-term incentive (\u0201GLTI\u0202)\n\nWhen referring to our long-term incentive awards we use the financial year end in which the award was made. For example, the '2023 award' was made in the financial year ending 31 March 2023. The awards are usually made in the first half of the financial year.\n\nThe extent to which awards vest depends on three performance conditions:\n\n- -underlying operational performance as measured by adjusted free cash flow;\n- -relative Total Shareholder Return ('TSR') against a peer group median; and\n- -performance against our Environmental, Social, and Governance ('ESG') targets.\n\nFurther details of these performance conditions are set out below. The Remuneration Committee reserves the right during the lifetime of the Remuneration Policy to change the performance conditions applicable to GLTI awards to other financial, shareholder return and strategic metrics, if the Remuneration Committee determines that to do so would be in the best interests of the Company. However, in such circumstances, the majority of the GLTI awards would continue to remain subject to financial performance targets. The Remuneration Committee would engage with major shareholders prior to changing the performance conditions applicable to GLTI awards in this way.\n\n## Adjusted free cash flow\n\nThe free cash flow performance is based on the cumulative adjusted free cash flow figure over the performance period. The detailed targets and the definition of adjusted free cash flow are determined each year as appropriate. The target adjusted free cash flow level is set by reference to our long-range plan and market expectations. The Remuneration Committee sets these targets to be sufficiently demanding and with significant stretch.\n\nThe cumulative adjusted free cash flow vesting levels as a percentage of the award subject to this performance element are shown in the table below (with linear interpolation between points):\n\n| Performance     | Vesting percentage  (% of FCF element)   |\n|-----------------|------------------------------------------|\n| Below threshold | 0%                                       |\n| Threshold       | 20%                                      |\n| Maximum         | 100%                                     |\n\n## Relative TSR\n\nWe have a limited number of appropriate peers and this makes the measurement of a relative ranking system volatile. As such, the outperformance of the median of a peer group is felt to be the most appropriate TSR measure. The peer group and outperformance range for the performance condition are reviewed each year and amended as appropriate.\n\nThe TSR vesting levels as a percentage of the award subject to this performance element are shown in the table below (with linear interpolation between points):\n\n| Performance                                                | Vesting percentage  (% of TSR element)   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|\n| Below threshold                                            | 0%                                       |\n| Threshold (median)                                         | 20%                                      |\n| Maximum (outperformance of median as determined per award) | 100%                                     |\n\nIn order to determine the percentages for the equivalent outperformance levels above median, the Remuneration Committee seeks independent external advice.\n\n## ESG performance\n\nOur ESG targets are set on an annual basis (in accordance with our approach for our other performance measures) and are aligned to our externally communicated ambitions in this area. Where performance is below the agreed ambition, the Remuneration Committee will use its discretion to assess vesting based on performance against the stated ambition and any other relevant information.\n\n## Remuneration policy for other employees\n\nWhile our remuneration policy follows the same fundamental principles across the Group, packages offered to employees reflect differences in market practice in the different countries, role and seniority.\n\nFor example, the remuneration package elements for our Executive Committee are essentially the same as for the Executive Directors with some minor differences, for example smaller levels of share awards and local variances where appropriate. The remuneration for the next level of management, our Senior Leadership Team, again follows the same principles with local and/or individual performance aspects in the annual bonus targets and GLTI awards. They also receive lower levels of share awards which are partly delivered in conditional share awards without performance conditions.",

Any new Director's remuneration package will take into account the elements and constraints of those of the existing Directors performing similar roles and the individual circumstances of the new Director. This means a potential maximum bonus opportunity of 200% of base salary and long-term incentive maximum face value of opportunity at award of 500% of base salary.\n\nWhen considering the remuneration arrangements of individuals recruited from external roles to the Board, we will take into account the remuneration package of that individual in their prior role. We only provide additional compensation to individuals for awards forgone. If necessary we will seek to replicate, as far as practicable, the level and timing of such remuneration, taking into account also any remaining performance requirements applying to it. This will be achieved by granting awards of cash or shares that vest over a timeframe similar to those forfeited and, if appropriate, based on performance conditions. A commensurate reduction in quantum will be applied where it is determined that the new awards are either not subject to performance conditions or subject to performance conditions that are not as stretching as those of the awards forfeited. Where it is not practicable to grant these 'buy-out' awards using the GLTI rules submitted to shareholders at the 2023 AGM, the Company may grant these awards using bespoke arrangements.\n\n## Service contracts of Executive Directors\n\nExecutive Directors\u0202 contracts have rolling terms and can be terminated with no more than 12 months\u0202 notice.\n\nThe key elements of the service contract for Executive Directors relate to remuneration, payments on loss of office (see next page), and restrictions during active employment (and for 12 months thereafter). These restrictions include non-competition and non-solicitation of customers and employees.",

Outstanding awards and options would normally vest and become exercisable on a change of control taking into account, in respect of GLTI awards, the extent to which, in the Remuneration Committee's opinion, any relevant performance conditions are satisfied, the Company's and the Executive Director's performance, any other relevant factors and, unless the Remuneration Committee determines otherwise, the proportion of the vesting period that has elapsed.\n\nIn the event of a demerger, distribution (other than an ordinary dividend) or other transaction which would affect the current or future value of any award, the Remuneration Committee may allow awards to vest on the same basis as for a change of control described above. Alternatively, an adjustment may be made to the number of shares if considered appropriate.\n\n## Payments for departing Executive Directors\n\nIn the table below we summarise the key elements of our Remuneration Policy on payments for loss of office.

The Committee's function is to exercise independent judgement and consists only of the following independent Non-Executive Directors:\n\nChair: Amparo Moraleda (appointed 25 July 2023), Valerie Gooding (until 25 July 2023)\n\nCommittee members: Delphine Ernotte Cunci, Michel Demar\u00e9 and Dame Clara Furse (until 25 July 2023)\n\nThe Committee regularly consults with Margherita Della Valle, Group Chief Executive, and Leanne Wood, the Chief Human Resources Officer, on various matters relating to the appropriateness of awards for Executive Directors and senior executives, though they are not present when their own compensation is discussed. In addition, James Ludlow, the Group Reward and Policy Director, provides a perspective on information provided to the Committee, and requests information and analysis from external advisers as required. Maaike de Bie, the Group General Counsel and Company Secretary, advises the Committee on corporate governance guidelines and is Secretary to the Committee.\n\n## External advisers\n\nThe Committee seeks and considers advice from independent remuneration advisers where appropriate. The appointed advisers, WTW, were appointed by the Committee in 2007. The Chair of the Committee has direct access to these advisers as and when required, and the Committee determines the protocols by which these advisers interact with management in support of the Committee. The advice and recommendations of the external advisers are used as a guide, but do not serve as a substitute for thorough consideration of the issues by each Committee member. Advisers attend Committee meetings occasionally, as and when required by the Committee.\n\nWTW is a member of the Remuneration Consultants' Group and, as such, voluntarily operates under the Remuneration Consultants' Group Code of Conduct in relation to executive remuneration consulting in the UK. This is based upon principles of transparency, integrity, objectivity, competence, due care and confidentiality by executive remuneration consultants. WTW has confirmed that it adhered to that Code of Conduct throughout the year for all remuneration services provided to Vodafone and therefore the Committee is satisfied that it is independent and objective. The Remuneration Consultants' Group Code of Conduct is available at remunerationconsultantsgroup.com.\n\n|         |                                  |                                                                                                                                       | Fees for services provided   |                                                                                                                                         |\n|---------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|         |                                  |                                                                                                                                       | to the Committee             |                                                                                                                                         |\n| Adviser | Appointed by                     | Services provided to the Committee                                                                                                    | \u00a3'000 1                      | Other services provided to the Company                                                                                                  |\n| WTW     | Remuneration  Committee  in 2007 | Advice on market practice; governance;  provision of market data on executive  reward; reward consultancy; and  performance analysis. | \u00a3140                         | Reward and benefits consultancy;  provision of benchmark data;  outsourced pension administration; and  insurance consultancy services. |\n\n## Note:\n\n- 1.

Specifically, we have provided a table that shows all remuneration that was earned by each individual during the year and computed a single total remuneration figure for the year. The value of the annual bonus (\u0201GSTIP\u0202) reflects what was earned in respect of the year but will be paid out in the following year. Similarly the value of the long-term incentive ('GLTI') reflects the share award which will vest in August 2024 as a result of the performance through the three-year period ended 31 March 2024.\n\n## Consideration of the use of discretion\n\nThe Remuneration Committee reviews all incentive awards prior to payment and uses judgement to ensure that the final assessments of performance are fair and appropriate. If circumstances warrant it, the Committee may adjust the final payment or vesting.\n\nThe Committee reviewed incentive outcomes at the May 2024 meeting and considered the appropriateness of outcomes in light of wider financial and business performance and the wider employee experience across the relevant measurement periods for both the short-term and long-term incentive plans. The Committee agreed the outcomes were appropriate and that no adjustments were required to either the short-term or long-term incentive outcomes this year.\n\n## Board changes\n\nMargherita Della Valle was appointed Group Chief Executive on 27 April 2023, having previously held the role on an interim basis effective 1 January 2023. Prior to this Margherita had held the role of Chief Financial Officer. Margherita's 2024 single figure therefore predominantly reflects remuneration received in respect of her time as Group Chief Executive whereas her 2023 single figure includes remuneration arrangements in relation to her time as Chief Financial Officer.\n\nLuka Mucic was appointed Group Chief Financial Officer on 1 September 2023 and this period of service is reflected in his 2024 single figure.\n\n## Total remuneration for the 2024 financial year (audited)\n\n|                                                    | Margherita Della Valle   | Margherita Della Valle   | Luka Mucic   | Luka Mucic   |\n|----------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|--------------|--------------|\n|                                                    | 2024  \u00a3'000              | 2023  \u00a3'000              | 2024  \u00a3'000  | 2023  \u00a3'000  |\n| Salary/fees                                        | 1,238                    | 806                      | 443          | -            |\n| Taxable benefits 1                                 | 40                       | 26                       | 115          | -            |\n| Annual bonus: GSTIP (see below for further detail) | 1,780                    | 1,206                    | 631          | -            |\n| Total long-term incentive:                         | 1,198                    | 1,288                    | -            | -            |\n| GLTI awards 2,3                                    | 894                      | 977                      | -            | -            |\n| GLTI dividends 4                                   | 304                      | 311                      | -            | -            |\n| Pension/cash in lieu of pension                    | 124                      | 81                       | 44           | -            |\n| Total                                              | 4,380                    | 3,407                    | 1,233        | -            |\n| Total Fixed Remuneration                           | 1,402                    | 913                      | 602          | -            |\n| Total Variable Remuneration                        | 2,978                    | 2,494                    | 631          | -            |\n\n## Notes:\n\n- 1.  Taxable benefits include amounts in respect of:\n- - Private healthcare (2024: Margherita Della Valle \u00a32,801; 2023: Margherita Della Valle \u00a32,575);\n- - Cash car allowance \u00a319,200 p.a.;\n- - Travel (2024: Margherita Della Valle \u00a317,590, Luka Mucic \u00a31,663; 2023: Margherita Della Valle \u00a34,235); and\n- - Relocation (2024: Luka Mucic \u00a3102,215).\n- 2.  The share prices used for the 2023 and 2024 values, as set out in note 3 below, are lower than the grant prices for the respective awards. As such, no amount of the value shown in the 2023 or 2024 column is attributable to share price appreciation during the performance or vesting periods.\n- 3.  The value shown in the 2023 column is the award which vested on 3 August 2023 and is valued using the execution share price on 3 August 2023 of 72.84 pence. The value shown in the 2024 column is the award which vests on 3 August 2024 and is valued using an average closing share price over the last quarter of the 2024 financial year of 67.84 pence.\n- 4.  Under the GLTI, executives receive a cash award equivalent in value to the dividends that would have been paid during the vesting period on any shares that vest. The dividend value shown in 2024 relates to awards vesting on 3 August 2024.\n\n## 2024 annual bonus ('GSTIP') payout (audited)\n\nIn the table below we disclose our achievement against each of the performance measures and targets in our annual bonus ('GSTIP') and the resulting total annual bonus payout level for the year ended 31 March 2024 of 71.2% of maximum. This is applied to the maximum bonus level of 200% of base salary for each Executive Director.

Each market was assessed against a number of different metrics against the following measures:\n\n- -Net Promoter Score ('NPS') for both Consumer and Vodafone Business - defined as the extent to which our customers would recommend us.\n- -Churn - defined as total gross customer disconnections in the period divided by the average total customers in the period.\n- -Revenue market share ('RMS') - based on our total service revenue and that of our competitors in the markets we operate in.\n\nAll measures utilise data from our local markets which is collected and validated for quality and consistency by independent third-party agencies where possible. Further details on our performance against each key metric is set out below.\n\nDuring the year we recorded strong Consumer NPS market leadership or co-leadership positions in UK, Italy, Ireland, Portugal and Albania in Europe, and South Africa, Egypt, Tanzania, Lesotho and DRC in Africa. Our benchmark Consumer NPS monitoring was supported with additional insight gained from launching lifecycle NPS monitoring across a number of our markets. This methodology assessed our progress against our strategic focus of reducing the number of deep detractors by asking whether customers would recommend Vodafone to friends, family or colleagues. All but one of our markets saw a reduction in deep detractors with notable progress made in Portugal, Turkey and the UK. Overall, we reduced deep detractors by 14% in Europe and 16% at a Group level - a reduction of over four million unhappy customers from the start of the year. In respect of Business NPS, we ended the performance period holding the lead position in five markets and made significant improvements in our gap to market leaders in Germany and Turkey.\n\nWe have recorded broadly stable overall churn levels in our European markets. In respect of mobile, we have maintained low churn levels in Vodacom Group and in a number of our European markets. In both Germany and the UK we have seen year-on-year improvements and in the UK this has been principally driven by customer experience initiatives. In respect of our fixed services, we have recorded steady year-on-year results in Europe and improvements in Turkey and our African markets despite economic and geopolitical challenges.\n\nWe have reported steady results in our overall RMS position this year with good performance reported in a majority of our markets, supported by an updated pricing strategy. We have seen year-on-year improvements in our fixed line services in markets including, but not limited to, the UK, Egypt, Greece and Czech Republic. Elsewhere in our mobile services, we have reported improvements in South Africa, Egypt, Portugal and Romania.\n\nIt is within this context that performance against our customers measures during the year was judged to be above the mid point of the respective ranges for NPS and churn and at the mid point of the target range for RMS.\n\n## Overall outcome\n\n| 2024 annual bonus ('GSTIP') amounts   | Base salary  \u00a3'000   | Maximum bonus  % of base salary   | 2024 payout  % of maximum   | Actual payment  \u00a3'000   |\n|---------------------------------------|----------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------------|\n| Margherita Della Valle                | 1,250                | 200%                              | 71.2%                       | 1,780 1                 |\n| Luka Mucic                            | 760                  | 200%                              | 71.2%                       | 631 1,2                 |\n\n## Notes:\n\n- 1.  25% of both executives' post-tax bonus will be deferred into shares for two years.\n- 2.

This reflected full achievement under the GHG reduction and the Women in management metrics where ambitions were exceeded, and partial vesting under the M-Pesa metric where strong progress against the stretching ambition was made.\n\n## 2022 GLTI award: TSR performance\n\nGrowth in the value of a hypothetical US$100 holding over the performance period, six-month averaging\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nmedian 8.5% p.a.\n\nThe vesting outcome when applied to the number of shares granted is set out in the table below.\n\n| 2022 GLTI share awards subject to performance conditions  vesting in August 2024   | Maximum  number  of shares   | Adjusted free cash  flow performance  payout  % of maximum   | Relative TSR  performance payout  % of maximum   | ESG  performance payout  % of maximum   | Weighted  performance payout  % of maximum   | Number of  shares vesting   | Value of  shares vesting  ('000)   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|------------------------------------|\n| Margherita Della Valle                                                             | 2,696,917                    | 65.3%                                                        | 0%                                               | 96.9%                                   | 48.9%                                        | 1,317,713                   | \u00a3893,936                           |\n\nSpecified procedures are performed by our internal audit team over the adjusted free cash flow to assist with the Committee's assessment of performance.

Face value calculated based on the closing share price on 26 July 2023 (day immediately preceding the date of the July grant) of 77.5 pence in respect of the award made to Margherita Della Valle and the closing share price on 16 November 2023 (day immediately preceding the date of the November grant) of 73.2 pence in respect of the award made to Luka Mucic.\n\n## Outstanding awards\n\nThe structure for awards made in July 2022 (vesting July 2025) and July 2023 (vesting July 2026) is set out on the previous page. Further details of the structure of these awards, and relevant targets, can be found in the Annual Report on Remuneration of the relevant year.\n\n## All-employee share plans\n\nDuring the year the Executive Directors were eligible to participate in the Vodafone Group Sharesave Plan which is a HM Revenue & Customs ('HMRC') approved scheme. Options under the plan are granted at up to a 20% discount to market value. No Executive Directors currently hold options under the plan.\n\n## Pensions (audited)\n\nDuring the 2024 financial year, Margherita Della Valle accrued benefits under the defined contribution pension plan of \u00a310,000, with the remainder of her 10% of base salary pension benefit for the year delivered as a cash allowance. Luka Mucic received a pro-rated cash allowance of 10% of base salary.\n\nMargherita Della Valle has not participated in a Vodafone sponsored defined benefit scheme during her employment. The Executive Directors are provided benefits in the event of death in service. In the event of ill health, an entitlement to benefit of two-thirds of base salary, up to a maximum benefit determined by the insurer, may be provided up until state pension age. In respect of the Executive Committee members, during the year the Group has made aggregate contributions of \u00a3171,177 (2023: \u00a3147,507) into defined contribution pension schemes during the year.\n\n## Alignment to shareholder interests (audited)\n\nShare ownership levels and requirements for individuals who held the position of Executive Director are set out in the table below.\n\nAs shown in the chart below, both executives increased their shareholding level during the year.

To be eligible for a short-term incentive award, employees must meet minimum performance standards, which include completion of our mandatory compliance training.\n\n## Fair pay at Vodafone\n\nIn addition to being a core principle of the Committee, there is a clear culture in our business of ensuring we offer competitive and fair pay to all our people. Our approach across our business is guided by the six principles set out below. Our commitment to these principles is reflected in how the UK-based Living Wage Foundation has certified us as an Accredited Living Wage employer.\n\n## 1. Market competitive\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe pay of our people is reflective of their skills, role and function and the external market.\n\nWe annually review the pay of each person and actively manage any who fall below the market competitive range.\n\n## 4. Share in our successes\n\n## 5. Provide benefits for all\n\n## 6. Open and transparent\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAll our people should have the opportunity to share in our success by being eligible to receive some form of performance-related pay, e.g. a bonus, shares or sales incentive.\n\nOur global standard is to offer all our people life insurance, parental leave and access to either Company or state provided healthcare and pension provision.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nClick to read more about fair pay at Vodafone: vodafone.com/fair-pay\n\n## Cost of living actions\n\nRising inflation levels and the subsequent cost of living crisis continue to affect a number of employees in our markets. As a result, we continue to provide targeted measures which include the delivery of additional or accelerated salary reviews and the provision of extra cash allowances outside the annual reward review cycle.\n\nGiven the rapid inflationary change affecting those in Egypt, a supplementary Cost of Living Allowance ('COLA') was introduced, prior to two off-cycle increases implemented during the year. In Turkey, where they are experiencing hyper-inflation, we took a similar approach by accelerating our salary reviews and providing two additional off-cycle increases.\n\nWe ensure that our people understand their pay. We do this through a series of user-friendly guides, webpages and an annual reward statement, which help explain our people's pay and outline the value of their core reward package.\n\n## 2. Free from discrimination\n\n## 3. Ensure a good standard of living\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur pay should not be affected by gender, age, disability, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, race, ethnicity, cultural heritage or belief.\n\nWe annually compare the average position of our men and women against their market benchmark, grade and function to identify and understand any differences and take action if necessary.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe work with an independent organisation, WageIndicator Foundation, to assess how our pay compares to the 'living wage' in each of our markets because we are committed to providing a good standard of living for our people and their families.",

For all our markets we carefully consider wider market conditions when setting salary budgets for the 2024 annual reward review.\n\n## Risk management\n\nThe Committee undertakes an annual review of the potential risks within our incentive plans and what steps have been taken to mitigate these. The review looks at both the structure of our incentives and the performance conditions used. Given our current structure and performance metrics, the 2024 review focused on risk areas such as capital expenditure and alignment between management and stakeholders.\n\n## Stakeholder engagement\n\nThe Committee considers all stakeholder groups when setting executive pay including:\n\n| Employees     | The Committee is fully briefed on pay arrangements across the business to ensure any decisions on executive pay are made  within our wider business context and take into account wider employee pay conditions. We engage with our employees  through a variety of means including employee forums, interactive webinars (including with our executives), global Spirit  Beat surveys and digital platforms, all of which give our people the chance to voice their opinion on any area of interest,  including all-employee and executive pay.   |\n|---------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Customers     | The importance of customers to our strategy is reflected in how our annual bonus plan includes the customer-focused  measures of Revenue Market Share, NPS, and Churn.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n| Shareholders  | The Committee values the active participation of our shareholders during our consultations and fully considers all feedback  as part of the review process.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n| Government    | The Committee actively engages with external professional bodies and government departments when they issue  consultations on proposed changes to legislation or reporting guidelines.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n| Wider society | The Committee is fully aware that society remains concerned about the risk of excessive executive pay practices in the  wider market. The Committee believes that transparent reporting and active engagement in explaining both the operation  of, and rationale for, executive pay decisions is key for businesses to retain trust in this area.                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n\n## UK gender pay gap reporting\n\nEach year we publish our UK gender pay gap in line with the statutory UK methodology. The nature of the statutory calculation means the gap will fluctuate year on year, influenced by changes in our business structure, Company performance and the percentage of men and women at all levels and positions. The existence of a UK gender pay gap in our business is primarily a consequence of more men than women holding senior or specialist, and therefore higher-paid, roles.\n\nWith our commitment to embed an inclusive culture, we continue our work to reduce the gap and have made good progress since the publication of our first report in 2017. Our global programmes aim to support women across different roles, areas, and geographies of our business and will, over time, reduce our specific UK gender pay gap, which this year was calculated as 9.0% - a slight decrease from our 2022 figure of 10.4%.\n\nWe are proud of the policies that we have put in place to support our employees and we remain committed to addressing female representation at senior levels and the gender pay gap.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nClick to learn more about our initiatives, case studies, and key statistics on our dedicated UK gender pay gap webpage:\n\nvodafone.com/uk-gender-pay-gap\n\n## Relative spend on pay\n\nThe chart below shows both the dividends distributed in the year and the total cost of remuneration in the Group.\n\n\u20acm\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nof dividends\n\nremuneration for all employees\n\n<!-- image -->",

In line with the relevant regulations this utilises the most recently collected and disclosed data analysed within our Gender Pay Gap report, with employees at the three quartiles identified from this analysis and their respective single figure values calculated.\n\nTo ensure this data accurately reflects individuals at such quartiles, the single figure values for individuals immediately above and below the identified employee at each quartile within the gender pay gap analysis were also reviewed.\n\nIn recent years our ratios have remained relatively consistent, reflecting how the single figures for both the Chief Executive and employees at the quartile positions have remained stable when viewed over the period set out in the table above. In general we expect the ratios to be primarily driven by the valuation of the long-term incentive that is included in the Chief Executive's single figure for the year.",

Luka Mucic was appointed as Group Chief Financial Officer on 1 September 2023.\n- 2.  Valerie Gooding, Sir Crispin Davis, and Dame Clara Furse stepped down on 25 July 2023.\n- 3.  Hatem Dowidar was appointed on 19 February 2024.\n\nAs set out in last year's report, the year-on-year increase in Margherita Della Valle's pay between 2022 and 2023 reflects Margherita's change in role during the period. The percentage increase in the table above does not reflect the actual increase during the year under review in respect of the salary payable for the role of Chief Executive which was increased by 3% effective 1 July 2022. Further details can be found in the 2023 Directors' Remuneration Report.\n\nThe significant year-on-year increase in fees and taxable benefits for Christine Ramon between 2023 and 2024, Deborah Kerr between 2022 and 2023, and Jean-Fran\u00e7ois van Boxmeer between 2021 and 2022 reflect how the values in the previous year were not based on a full 12 months of service due to their respective appointments at various points in the year. Therefore the year-on-year increase does not indicate an actual increase in the fees payable to the Chairman and Non-Executive Directors during those periods.\n\nWhilst some of the percentages within the 'Taxable benefits' column look significant, these actually reflect relatively small increases in value when viewed on an absolute basis. The significant change in taxable benefits for the period between 2021 and 2022 reflect how certain travel and accommodation expenses in relation to attending Board meetings were lower than normal in 2021 due to the impact of COVID-19 on the ability to attend meetings in-person.\n\n## Assessing pay and performance\n\nIn the table on the next page we summarise the Chief Executive's single figure remuneration over the past 10 years and how our variable pay plans have paid out in relation to the maximum opportunity. This can be compared with the historic TSR performance over the same period. The chart below shows the performance of the Company relative to the STOXX Europe 600 Index over a 10-year period. The STOXX Europe 600 Index was selected as this is a broad-based index that includes markets in which we operate. It should be noted that the TSR element of the 2022 GLTI is based on the TSR performance shown in the chart on page 109 and not this chart.\n\n## 10-year historical TSR performance\n\nGrowth in the value of a hypothetical \u20ac100 holding over 10 years\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|                         | 2014   | 2015   | 2016   | 2017   | 2019   | 2020   | 2021   | 2022   | 2023   | 2024   |\n|-------------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Vodafone Group          |        |        |        |        |        |        |        |        |        |        |\n|                         |        | 122    | 116    | 125    | 133    | 116    |        |        |        |        |\n| STOXX Europe  600 Index | 100    | 121    | 107    | 107    |        |        |        |        |        |        |\n|                         |        |        |        |        |        |        |        | 89     |        |        |\n|                         |        |        |        |        | 82     |        |        |        | 66     | 59     |",

This was felt to be appropriate considering Margherita Della Valle's salary increase following her permanent appointment as Group Chief Executive in April 2023, and given Luka Mucic's salary was set appropriately when he joined as Chief Financial Officer in September 2023. As a result, the salaries for the Executive Directors are as follows:\n\n- -Group Chief Executive (Margherita Della Valle): \u00a31,250,000\n- -Group Chief Financial Officer (Luka Mucic): \u00a3760,000\n\n## 2025 annual bonus ('GSTIP')\n\nFollowing its annual review of the GSTIP structure, the Committee agreed that the performance measures and associated weightings continue to support the strategic priorities of Growth and Customers and therefore the 2025 plan should remain unchanged from 2024 as follows:\n\n## Growth (70% of total)\n\nService revenue (20%); adjusted EBIT (20%); adjusted free cash flow (20%); and revenue market share (10%).\n\n## Customers (30% of total)\n\nNet Promoter Score 1 (20%); and churn (10%).\n\nNote:\n\n- 1.  The assessment of NPS utilises data collected in our local markets which is validated for quality and consistency by independent third-party agencies.\n\nDue to the potential impact on our commercial interests, annual bonus targets are considered commercially sensitive and therefore will be disclosed in the 2025 Remuneration Report following the completion of the financial year.\n\n## Long-term incentive ('GLTI') awards for 2025\n\nAwards for 2025 will be made in line with the arrangements described in our policy on pages 102 and 103. Vesting of the 2025 award will be subject to adjusted free cash flow (60% of total award), relative TSR (30% of total award), and ESG (10% of total award) performance. Performance will be measured over the three financial years ending 31 March 2027, and any net vested shares will be subject to an additional two-year holding period. It is anticipated that the final awards will be reviewed by the Committee at the July 2024 meeting and, subject to the Committee's approval, will be granted shortly afterwards.\n\nFurther details of the 2025 award targets are provided below and on the next page.\n\n## Adjusted free cash flow (60% of total award)\n\nDetails of the final three-year adjusted free cash flow target range will be disclosed in the relevant market announcement at the time of grant and published in the 2025 Directors' Remuneration Report.",

The Committee reviewed the TSR peer group and noted the removal of Telef\u00f3nica Deutschland based on its recent unlisted status, and agreed to remove Royal KPN based on its relevance to the Company. Further details on the TSR outperformance range and peer group for the 2025 award are set out in the tables below.\n\n| Relative TSR (30% of total award)   |                  | TSR outperformance   | Vesting (% of relative TSR element)   |\n|-------------------------------------|------------------|----------------------|---------------------------------------|\n| Below threshold                     | Below threshold  | Below median         | 0.0%                                  |\n| Threshold                           | Threshold        | Median               | 20.0%                                 |\n| Maximum                             | Maximum          | 7.0% p.a.            | 100.0%                                |\n| TSR peer group                      |                  |                      |                                       |\n| BT Group                            | Deutsche Telekom | Liberty Global       | MTN                                   |\n| Orange                              | Telecom Italia   | Telef\u00f3nica           |                                       |\n\nLinear interpolation (i.e. straight-line vesting) occurs for performance between threshold and maximum.\n\n## ESG (10% of total award)\n\nThe table below sets out how performance under the ESG measure for the 2025 award will be assessed against two quantitative ambitions:\n\n| Purpose focus area 1   | Metric for 2025 GLTI                 | Overall ambition                                                           | Baseline position for 2025 GLTI                                                  | Ambition for 2025 GLTI                                                           |\n|------------------------|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Protecting our  Planet | Net zero                             | 90% reduction in Scope 1 & 2  emissions by 2030 against a  FY20 baseline 2 | 66% reduction in Scope 1 & 2  emissions versus a FY20 baseline  at 31 March 2024 | 86% reduction in Scope 1 & 2  emissions versus a FY20 baseline  by 31 March 2027 |\n| Empowering  People     | Female representation  in management | 40% representation of women  in management by 2030                         | 35% representation of women in  management at 31 March 2024                      | 37% representation of women in  management by 31 March 2027                      |\n\nNotes:\n\n- 1.  This year our Company Purpose has been refreshed and applicable focus areas outlined above have been renamed to Protecting the Planet and Empowering People. Read more on page 80.\n- 2.  This near-term greenhouse gas emissions reduction target has been validated by the Science Based Targets initiative ('SBTi').\n\nEach ambition for the 2025 award has been set by considering both our externally communicated targets and our internal progress as at 31 March 2024. The Committee agreed to remove the financial inclusion metric included in previous awards based on its sole focus on Vodacom Group which limits its global reach compared to other metrics outlined above.\n\nAt the end of the performance period the Committee will assess achievement across the two metrics against the stated ambitions and determine vesting under this element. Full disclosure of the rationale for the final vesting decision will be provided in the relevant Directors' Remuneration Report.\n\n## 2025 remuneration for the Chair and Non-Executive Directors\n\nFees for our Chair and Non-Executive Directors have been benchmarked against the FTSE 30 (excluding financial services companies). Following this year's review it was agreed that the current additional fee levels for the Senior Independent Director and/or Committee Chairs would be increased. While it was agreed there would be no changes to the Chair and Non-Executive Director base fee at this time, fees will be assessed in next year's review. Details of the 2025 fee levels are set out in the table below.\n\n| Position/role                                                         |   2025 fee payable  \u00a3'000 |   2024 fee payable  \u00a3'000 |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|\n| Chair 1                                                               |                       650 |                       650 |\n| Non-Executive Director                                                |                       115 |                       115 |\n| Additional fee for the Senior Independent Director                    |                        35 |                        25 |\n| Additional fee for Committee Chair: Audit & Risk                      |                        40 |                        25 |\n| Additional fee for Committee Chair: Remuneration, ESG, and Technology |                        35 |                        25 |\n\nNote:\n\n- 1.  The Chair's fee also includes the fee for the chairing of the Nominations and Governance Committee.\n\n## Further remuneration information\n\n## Dilution\n\nAll awards are made under plans that incorporate dilution limits as set out in the guidelines for share incentive schemes published by the Investment Association. The current estimated dilution from subsisting executive awards is approximately 2.8% of the Company's share capital at 31 March 2024 (2.4% at 31 March 2023), whilst from all-employee share awards it is approximately 0.3% (0.3% at 31 March 2023). This gives a total dilution of 3.1% (2.7% at 31 March 2023).\n\n## Service contracts\n\nThe terms and conditions of appointment of our Directors are available for inspection at the Company's registered office during normal business hours and at the Annual General Meeting (for 15 minutes prior to the meeting and during the meeting). The Executive Directors have notice periods in their service contracts of 12 months. The Non-Executive Directors' letters of appointment do not contain provision for notice periods or for compensation if their appointments are terminated.\n\nThis report on remuneration has been approved by the Board of Directors and signed on its behalf by:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Amparo Moraleda\n\nOn behalf of the Remuneration Committee",

In addition, the exact lease term is subject to the non-cancellable period and rights and options in each contract. Generally, lease terms are judged to be the longer of the non-cancellable term and:\n\n- -Between 5 and 10 years for land and buildings (excluding retail), with terms at the top end of this range if the lease relates to assets that are considere to be difficult to exit sooner for economic, practical or reputational reasons;\n- -The period to the next contractual lease break date for retail premises (excluding breaks within the next 12 months);\n- -The lease term, or useful economic life, of the assets connected for leases that are used to provide internal connec;\n- -The customer service agreement length for leases of local loop connections or other assets required to provide fixed lor other services to individual customers; and\n- -5 years where the Group has leases for the use of space on towers for the placement of transmission equipment.\n\nIn most instances the Group has options to renew or extend leases for additional periods after the end of the lease term which are assessed using the criteria above.\n\nLease terms are reassessed if a significant event or change in circumstances occurs relating to the leased assets that is within the control of the Group; such changes usually relate to commercial agreements entered into by the Group, or business decisions made by the Group. Where such changes change the Group's assessment of whether it is reasonably certain to exercise options to extend, or not terminate leases, then the lease term is reassessed and the lease liability is remeasured, which in most cases will increase the lease liability.\n\n## Taxation\n\nThe Group's tax charge on ordinary activities is the sum of the total current and deferred tax charges. The calculation of the Group's total tax charge involves estimation and judgement in respect of certain matters, being principally:\n\n## Recognition of deferred tax assets\n\nSignificant items on which the Group has exercised accounting estimation and judgement include the recognition of deferred tax assets in respect of losses in Luxembourg, Germany, Italy 1 and Spain 1 as well as capital allowances in the United Kingdom. The recognition of deferred tax assets, particularly in respect of tax losses, is based upon whether management judge that it is probable that there will be sufficient and suitable taxable profits in the relevant legal entity or tax group against which to utilise the assets in the future. The Group assesses the availability of future taxable profits using the same undiscounted five year forecasts for the Group's operations as are used in the Group's value in use calculations (see note 4 'Impairment losses'). In the case of Luxembourg, this includes forecasts of future income from the Group's internal financing, centralised procurement and roaming activities.\n\nWhere tax losses are forecast to be recovered beyond the five year period, the availability of taxable profits is assessed using the cash flows and longterm growth rates used for the value in use calculations.\n\nThe estimated cash flows inherent in these forecasts include the unsystematic risks of operating in the telecommunications business including potential impacts of changes in the market structure, trends in customer pricing, the costs associated with the acquisition and retention of customers, future technological evolutions and potential regulatory changes, such as our ability to acquire and/or renew spectrum licences.\n\nChanges in the estimates which underpin the Group's forecasts could have an impact on the amount of future taxable profits and could have a significant impact on the period over which the deferred tax asset would be recovered.\n\nThe Group only considers substantively enacted tax laws when assessing the amount and availability of tax losses to offset against the future taxable profits. See note 6 'Taxation' to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nSee additional commentary relating to climate change below.\n\n## Uncertain tax positions\n\nThe tax impact of a transaction or item can be uncertain until a conclusion is reached with the relevant tax authority or through a legal process. The Group uses in-house tax experts when assessing uncertain tax positions and seeks the advice of external professional advisors where appropriat The most significant judgements in this area relate to the Group's tax disputes in India and a tax dispute related to financing costs in the Netherland Further details of tax disputes are included in note 29 'Contingent liabilities and legal proceedings' to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Business combinations and goodwill\n\nWhen the Group completes a business combination, the fair values of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired, including intangible assets, are recognised. The determination of the fair values of acquired assets and liabilities is based, to a considerable extent, on management's judgement. If the purchase consideration exceeds the fair value of the net assets acquired then the incremental amount paid is recognised as goodwill. If the purchase price consideration is lower than the fair value of the assets acquired then the difference is recorded as a gain in the income statem\n\nAllocation of the purchase price between finite lived assets (discussed below) and indefinite lived assets such as goodwill affects the subsequent results of the Group as finite lived intangible assets are amortised, whereas indefinite lived intangible assets, including goodwill, are not amortised.\n\nSee note 27  'Acquisitions and disposals' to the consolidated financial statements for further details.\n\n## Note:\n\n- 1 Deferred tax assets in respect of losses in Vodafone Italy and Vodafone Spain are reported with Assets held for sale.

The Group participates in a number of joint arrangements where control of the arrangement is shared with one or more other parties. Judgement is required to classify joint arrangements in a separate legal entity as either a joint operation or as a joint venture, which depends on management's assessment of the legal form and substance of the arrangement taking into account relevant facts and circumstances such as whether the owners have rights to substantially all the economic outputs and, in substance, settle the liabilities of the entity.\n\nTheclassificationcanhaveamaterialimpactontheconsolidatedfinancialstatements.TheGroup'sshareofassets,liabilities,revenue,expensesand cashflowsofjointoperationsareincludedintheconsolidatedfinancialstatementsonaline-by-linebasis,whereastheGroup'sinvestmentandshareof resultsofjointventuresareshownwithinsinglelineitemsintheconsolidatedstatementoffinancialpositionandconsolidatedincomestatement respectively.Seenote12 'Investmentsinassociatesandjointarrangements'totheconsolidatedfinancialstatements.

The useful life over which intangible assets are amortised depends on management's estimate of the period over which economic benefit will be derived from the asset. Useful lives are periodically reviewed to ensure that they remain appropriate. Management's estimates of useful life have a material impact on the amount of amortisation recorded in the year, but there is not considered to be a significant risk of material adjustment to carrying values of intangible assets in the year to 31 March 2025 if these estimates were revised.

Observable market data on fair values for equivalent assets is often limited and, for a number of reasons, transaction values agreed as part of any business acquor disposal may be higher than the assessed value in use.\n\nThe Group performs an annual impairment test which focuses on determining the recoverable amounts for its assets based on value in use, being the present value of the future cash flows it expects to generate from the continuing use of its assets or cash-generating units.\n\nCalculating the net present value of the future cash flows requires estimates to be made in respect of highly uncertain matters including management's expectations of:\n\n- -Growth in A djusted EBITDAaL, (see note 2 'Revenue disaggregation and segmental analysis' for a reconciliation to the consolidated income statement);\n- -Timing and amount of future capital expenditure, licence and spectrum payments;\n- -Long-term growth rates; and\n- -D iscount rates that reflect the future cash flows.\n\nChanging the assumptions selected by management, in particular projected A djusted EBITDAaL, long-term growth rate and discount rate assumptions, could significantly affect the Group's impairment evaluation and hence reported assets and profit or loss. Further details, including a sensitivity analysis, are included in note 4 'Impairment losses' to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nWhere the Group has interests in listed entities, market data, such as share price, is used to assess the fair value of those interests. If the market capitalisation indicates that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable, possible adjustments to the share price are reviewed and, where information is available, a value in use calculation is performed to support a conclusion on impairment.\n\nFor operations that are classified as held for sale, management is required to determine whether the carrying value of the discontinued o can be supported by the fair value less costs to sell. Where not observable in a quoted market, management has determined fair value less costs to sell by reference to the outcomes from the application of a number of potential valuation techniques, determined from inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.\n\nSee additional commentary relating to climate change, below.\n\n## Held for sale accounting\n\nWhen the value of a non-current asset or a group of assets in a disposal group will be primarily recovered through a sale transaction and there is an active plan for the disposal such that it is highly probable that the disposal will be completed within 12 months (subject to certain matters outsof the Group's control) then the related assets will be classified as held for sale and, where appropriate, as a discontinued operatio\n\nJudgement is applied by management in determining if assets meet the requirements to be classified as held for sale and, where appropriateas discontinued operations. Further detail is provided in note 7 'Discontinued operations and assets held for sale'.\n\n## Climate change\n\nThe potential climate change-related risks and opportunities to which the Group is exposed, as identified by management, are disclosed in the Group's Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures ('TCFD') on pages 64 to 69. Management has assessed the potential financial impacts relating to the identified risks, primarily considering the useful lives of, and retirement obligations for, property, plant and equipment, the possibility of impairment of goodwill and other long-lived assets and the recoverability of the Group's deferred tax assets. Management has exercised judgement in concluding that there are no further material financial impacts of the Group's climate-related risks and opportunities on the consolidated financial statements. These judgements will be kept under review by management as the future impacts of climate change depend on environmental, regulatory and other factors outside of the Group's control which are not all currently known.",

Each entity in the Group determin its own functional currency and items included in the financial statements of each entity are measured using that functional currency.\n\nWith the exception of the Group's Turkish lira operations and Safaricom's Ethiopian birr operations, which are subject to hyperinflation accountin (see above), transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded at the functional currency rate prevailing at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated into the respective functional currency of the entity at the rates prevailing on the reporting period date. Non-monetary items carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the initial transaction dates. Non-monetary items measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated.\n\nShare capital, share premium and other capital reserves are initially recorded at the functional currency rate prevailing at the date of the transact and are not retranslated.\n\nFor the purpose of presenting consolidated financial statements, the assets and liabilities of entities with a functional currency other than euro are expressed in euro using exchange rates prevailing at the reporting period date.\n\nIncome and expense items and cash flows are translated at the average exchange rates for each month and exchange differences arising are recognised directly in other comprehensive income. On disposal of a foreign entity, the cumulative amount previously recognisethe consolidated statement of comprehensive income relating to that particular foreign operation is recognised in profit or loss in the consolidate income statement.\n\nGoodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign operation are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign operation and translated accordingly.\n\nThe net foreign exchange loss recognised in the consolidated income statement for the year ended 31 March 2024 is \u20ac272  million (31 March 2023:\n\n\u20ac111 million gain; 2022: \u20ac309 million loss). The net gains and net losses are recorded within operating profit (2024: \u20ac110 million charge; 2023: \u20ac247 million credit; 2022: \u20ac24 million charge), financing costs (2024: \u20ac173 million charge; 2023: \u20ac135 million charge; 2022: \u20ac284 million charge) and income tax expense (2024: \u20ac11 million credit; 2023: \u20ac1 million charge; 2022: \u20ac1 million charge). The foreign exchange gains and losses included within other income arise on the disposal of subsidiaries, interests in joint ventures, associates and investments from the recycling of foreign exchange gains and losses previously recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.\n\n## Current or non-current classification\n\nAssets are classified as current in the consolidated statement of financial position where recovery is expected within 12 months of the reporting date. All assets where recovery is expected more than 12 months from the reporting date and all deferred tax assets, goodwill and intangible a property, plant and equipment and investments in associates and joint ventures are reported as non-current.\n\nLiabilities are classified as current unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the reporting date. For provisions, where the timing of settlement is uncertain, amounts are classified as non-current where settlement is expected more than 12 months from the reporting date. In addition, deferred tax liabilities and post-employment benefits are reported as non-current.\n\n## Inventory\n\nInventory is stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is determined on the basis of weighted average costs and comprises direct materials and, where applicable, direct labour costs and those overheads that have been incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition.",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\nStrategic report Governance Financials\n\nThe increase in the recovery period over the prior year is principally a result of lower forecast interest rates, driving margins down on existing financing activities, and lower internal financing income as the Group right-sizes its portfolio which includes the Group's announcemeof agreements to sell its operations in Spain and Italy. An increase or decrease in the forecast income in Luxembourg in each year of 5% -10% would change the period over which the losses will be fully utilised by 3 to 6 years either way. The Group uses different scenarios to forecast income to understand the impact that a change in interest rates or level of debt advanced by the Luxembourg companies could have on the recovery period of the losses.\n\nThe Group does not currently recognise deferred tax assets which are forecast to be used 60 years beyond the reporting period date.\n\nAny future changes in tax law or the structure of the Group could have a significant effect on the use of the Luxembourg losses, including the period over which these losses can be utilised. On the basis that future changes in tax laws are unknown, the profit forecasts assume that existing tax laws continue.\n\nBased on the above factors the Group concludes that it is probable that the Luxembourg companies will continue to generate taxable profits in the future against which it will use these losses.\n\n## Deferred tax assets in the UK\n\nThe Group has a recognised deferred tax asset in the UK totalling \u20ac2,485 million (2023: \u20ac1,809 million) which consists primaof excess capital allowances, which can be claimed on a reducing balance basis. The net deferred tax asset has increased in 2024, primarily due a \u20ac574 million reduction in an offsetting deferred tax liability in relation to mark-to-market movements on cash-flow hedging in Vodafone Group Plc. The UK tax group consists of the UK operating company along with Common Functions and Group Treasury. The Group has reviewed the latest forecasts for the UK business which incorporate the inherent risks of operating in the telecommunications In the period beyond the 5-year forecast we have reviewed the profits inherent in the terminal period and based on these and our expectations for the UK business we believe there should be sufficient taxable profits to utilise 90% of the deferred tax asset balance within 18  years, and 99% within 27  years.\n\nThe Group has losses amounting to \u20ac29,713 million (2023: \u20ac2,377 million) in respect of UK subsidiaries which are only available for offset against future capital gains and, due to the UK Substantial Shareholding Exemption rules, we do not believe it is probable we will utilise these losses such that no deferred tax asset has been recognised, as in the prior year.\n\nThe amount of capital losses grew significantly in 2024 as a result of the strike-off of a number of entities. The entities struck-off consisted of certain holding companies involved in historical M&A  activities, such as Vodafone's acquisition of the Mannesmann Group in 2000. The remaining losses relate to a number of other jurisdictions across the Group. There are also \u20ac2,941 million (2023: \u20ac2,443 million) of unrecognised temporary differences relating to treasury and other items.\n\n## Deferred tax assets on losses in Germany\n\nThe Group has a recognised deferred tax assets of \u20ac2,029 million (2023: \u20ac2,021 million) in Germany in respect of losses arising primon the write down of investments in Germany in 2000. The losses relate to German corporate tax and trade tax liabilities and they do not expire. The Group concluded it is probable that the German business will generate sufficient taxable profits in the future against which we can utilise these losses. The Group has reviewed the latest five -year forecasts for the German business, and the inherent risks of operating in the telecommunicatiobusiness In the period beyond the 5-year forecast, the Group has also specifically taken into consideration the implications of the Growth OpportunitieAct, substantively enacted in March 2024, which introduces new interest restriction rules applying to both corporate and trade tax, but also an increase in permitted loss utilisation against corporate tax. In combination, these two changes will increase taxable profits against accounting profits and increase loss utilisation. We expect to fully utilise the trade tax losses within 5-6 years, and corporate tax losses within 12-13 years.\n\n## Deferred tax assets in Italy\n\nThe Group has a deferred tax asset of \u20ac462 million (2023: \u20ac425 million), including \u20ac295 million (2023: \u20ac152 million) relating to tax losses in Italy, which is recognised as part of the held for sale assets and the value at the completion date will transfer with the business.\n\nIn assessing the recognition position for Italy, the Group has reviewed the latest forecasts for the Italian business which incorporate the unsystematic risks of operating in the telecommunications business. In the period beyond the 5-year forecast we have reviewed the profits inhere in the terminal period and based on these and our expectations for the Italian business we believe it is probable the Italian losses will be fully utilised.\n\n## Deferred tax assets in Spain\n\nThe Group recognises deferred tax assets in Spain up to the extent of deferred tax liabilities, with gross unrecognised losses of \u20ac5,504 million (2023: \u20ac5,130 million). The net \u20ac3 million deferred tax liability is recognised as part of the held for sale assets and the value (along with the amount of unrecognised losses) at the completion date will transfer with the business.\n\n## Impact of climate risks\n\nThe recovery of the Group's deferred tax assets is dependent on its forecasts of future profitability and the climate related risks have been considered in the Group's assessment of the recovery of those assets (see note 4 'Impairment losses'). The Group does not expect the climate related risks to have an impact on the ability of Luxembourg to continue to provide the internal financing, procurement, and roaming activities other members of the Group.\n\n## Unremitted earnings\n\nNo deferred tax liability has been recognised in respect of a further \u20ac38,380 million (2023: \u20ac26,371 million) of unremitted earnings of subsidiar because the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference, and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future. It is not practicable to estimate the amount of unrecognised deferred tax liabilities in respect of these unremitted earnings.",

Intangible assets\n\nThe consolidated statement of financial position contains significant intangible assets, mainly in relation to goodwill and licences and spectrum. Goodwill, which arises when we acquire a business and pay a higher amount than the fair value of its net assets primarily due to the synergies we expect to create, is not amortised but is subject to annual impairment reviews. Licences and spectrum are amortised over the life of the licence. For further details see 'Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty' in note 1 'Basis of preparation ' to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nIdentifiable intangible assets are recognised when the Group controls the asset, it is probable that future economic benefits attributed to the asset will flow to the Group and the cost of the asset can be reliably measured. Identifiable intangible assets are recognised at fair value when the Group completes a business combination. The determination of the fair values of the separately identified intangibles, is based, to a considerable extent, on management's judgement.\n\n## Goodwill\n\nGoodwill arising on the acquisition of an entity represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group's interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the entity recognised at the date of acquisition.\n\nGoodwill is initially recognised as an asset at cost and is subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is not subject to amortisation but is tested for impairment annually or whenever there is evidence that it may be impaired. Goodwill is denominated in the currency of the acquired entity and revalued to the closing exchange rate at each reporting period date.\n\nNegative goodwill arising on an acquisition is recognised directly in the consolidated income statement.\n\nOn disposal of a subsidiary or a joint arrangement, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss recognised in the consolidated income statement on disposal.\n\n## Finite lived intangible assets\n\nIntangible assets with finite lives are stated at acquisition or development cost, less accumulated amortisation. The amortisation period and method is reviewed at least annually. Changes in the expected useful life or the expected pattern of consumption of future economic benefits embodied in the asset are accounted for by changing the amortisation period or method, as appropriate, and are treated as changes in accounting estimates.\n\n## Licence and spectrum fees\n\nAmortisation periods for licence and spectrum fees are determined primarily by reference to the unexpired licence period, the conditions for licence renewal and whether licences are dependent on specific technologies. Amortisation is charged to the consolidated income statement on a straightline basis over the estimated useful lives from the commencement of related network services.\n\n## Software\n\nComputer software comprises software purchased from third parties as well as the cost of internally developed software. Computer software licences are capitalised on the basis of the costs incurred to acquire and bring into use the specific software. Costs that are directly associated with the production of identifiable and unique software products controlled by the Group, and are probable of producing future economic benefits, are recognised as intangible assets. Direct costs of software development include employee costs and directly attributable overheads.\n\nSoftware integral to an item of hardware equipment is classified as property, plant and equipment.\n\nCosts associated with maintaining software programs are recognised as an expense when they are incurred.\n\nAmortisation is charged to the consolidated income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life from the date the software is available for use.\n\n## Other intangible assets\n\nOther intangible assets, including brands and customer bases, are recorded at fair value at the date of acquisition. Amortisation is charged to the consolidated income statement, over the estimated useful lives of intangible assets from the date they are available for use, on a straight-line basis. The amortisation basis adopted for each class of intangible asset reflects the Group's consumption of the economic benefit from that asset.\n\n## Estimated useful lives\n\nThe estimated useful lives of finite lived intangible assets are as follows:\n\n| Licence and spectrum fees   | 3 - 40 years   |\n|-----------------------------|----------------|\n| Software                    | 3 - 10 years   |\n| Brands                      | 1 - 30 years   |\n| Customer bases              | 2 - 37 years   |",

Investments in associates and joint arrangements\n\nThe Group holds interests in associates in Kenya and in India, where we have significant influence, as well as in a number of joint arrangements, notably in the Netherlands, India, Australia and Oak Holdings 1 GmbH and its markets, where we share control with one or more third parties. For further details see 'Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty' in note 1 'Basis of preparation' to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Accounting policies\n\n## Interests in joint arrangements\n\nA joint arrangement is a contractual arrangement whereby the Group and other parties undertake an economic activity that is subject to joint control; that is, when the relevant activities that significantly affect the investee's returns require the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control. Joint arrangements are either joint operations or joint ventures.\n\nGains or losses resulting from the contribution or sale of a subsidiary as part of the formation of a joint arrangement are recognised in respect of the Group's entire equity holding in the subsidiary.\n\n## Joint operations\n\nA joint operation is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control have the rights to the assets, and obligations for the liabilities, relating to the arrangement or that other facts and circumstances indicate that this is the case. The Group's share of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and cash flows are combined with the equivalent items in the consolidated financial statements on a line-by-line basis.\n\nAny goodwill arising on the acquisition of the Group's interest in a joint operation is accounted for in accordance with the Group's accounting policy for goodwill arising on the acquisition of a subsidiary.\n\n## Joint ventures\n\nA joint venture is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control have the rights to the net assets of the arrangement.\n\nAt the date of acquisition, any excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group's share of the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the joint venture is recognised as goodwill. The goodwill is included within the carrying amount of the investment.\n\nThe results and assets and liabilities of joint ventures, other than those joint ventures or part thereof that are held for sale (see note 7 'Discontinued operations and assets held for sale'), are incorporated in the consolidated financial statements using the equity method of accounting. Under the equity method, investments in joint ventures are carried in the consolidated statement of financial position at cost adjusted for post-acquisition changes in the Group's share of the net assets of the joint venture, less any impairment in the value of the investment. The Group's share of post-tax profits or losses are recognised in the consolidated income statement. Losses of a joint venture in excess of the Group's interest in that joint venture are recognised only to the extent that the Group has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the joint venture.\n\n## Associates\n\nAn associate is an entity over which the Group has significant influence and that is neither a subsidiary nor an interest in a joint arrangement.\n\nSignificant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee but where the Group does not have control or joint control over those policies.\n\nAt the date of acquisition, any excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group's share of the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the associate is recognised as goodwill. The goodwill is included within the carrying amount of the investment.\n\nThe results and assets and liabilities of associates are incorporated in the consolidated financial statements using the same equity method of accounting used for joint ventures, described above.\n\n## Joint operations\n\nIn the prior year, on 22 March 2023, the Group completed the disposal of its principal joint operation (Cornerstone Telecommunications Infrastructure Limited) as part of the transaction with Oak Holdings 1 GmbH.",

Vodafone retained an interest of 64.2% in Oak Holdings 1 GmbH. On 18 July 2023, the Group completed the sale of 3.9% of Oak Holdings 1 GmbH for cash consideration of \u20ac500 million, reducing its interest to 60.3%.\n\n## OXG Glasfaser Beteiligungs GmbH\n\nIn March 2023, the Group entered into an agreement with Altice Luxembourg S.A. to create a joint venture, OXG Glasfaser Beteiligungs GmbH ('OXG'), with 50.0% shareholding held by each shareholder. Each shareholder is committed to contribute funding of up to \u20ac950 million to OXG for the deployment of fibre-to-the-home in Germany.  During the year ended 31 March 2024, the Group provided \u20ac32 million of capital contributions to OXG. The remaining funding commitment of \u20ac918 million is expected to be contributed between 2024 and 2029. The amount and timing of the funding depends on the speed and size of the fibre deployment. The contribution can be in the form of free capital reserves, shareholder loan, loan notes or similar instruments as agreed by the shareholders.\n\n## Vodafone Idea Limited\n\nThe Group's carrying value in Vodafone Idea Limited ('VIL') reduced to \u20acnil at 30 September 2019. The Group's share of VIL's losses not recognised at 31 March 2024 is \u20ac4,528 million (2023: \u20ac3,717 million). Vodafone Idea Limited has undertaken equity fund-raisings totalling \u20ac2.2 billion since 31 March 2024, reducing the Group's shareholding to 23.2%\n\nThe value of the Group's 21.0% shareholding in Indus Towers Limited is, in part, dependent on the income generated by Indus Towers Limited from tower rentals to major customers, including VIL. Any inability of these major customers to pay such amounts in the future may impact the carrying value of \u20ac1,104 million at 31 March 2024 (2023: \u20ac908 million) of the Group's investment in Indus Towers Limited.\n\nVIL has undertaken equity fund-raisings totalling \u20ac2.2 billion since 31 March 2024, reducing the Group's shareholding to 23.2%.",

The remaining items are measured at fair value and the basis is level 2 classification, which comprises items where fair value is determined from inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.\n- 2 Items are measured at amortised cost and have a fair value of \u20ac810 million (2023: \u20ac803 million) with a valuation basis of level 2 classification.\n- 3 Items are measured at fair value and the valuation basis is level 1 classification.\n- 4 Items are measured at amortised cost and the carrying amount approximates fair value.\n- 5 Includes investments measured at a fair value of \u20ac459 million (2023: \u20ac1,409 million).

Collateral arrangements on derivative financial instruments result in cash being paid/(held), repayable when the derivatives are settled. These assets do not meet the definition of cash and cash equivalents but are included in the Group's net debt based on their liquidity.\n\nBonds and debt securities includes \u20ac587 million (2023: \u20acnil) of highly liquid French; \u20ac308 million (2023: \u20ac290 million) Dutch; \u20ac306 million (2023: \u20ac899 million) Japanese and \u20acnil (2023: \u20ac150 million) German government securities.\n\nManaged investment funds of \u20ac2,024 million (2023: \u20ac2,967 million) are in funds with liquidity of up to 90 days.\n\nCollateral assets of \u20ac741 million (2023: \u20ac239 million) represents collateral paid on derivative financial instruments.\n\nOther investments are excluded from net debt based on their liquidity and primarily consist of restricted debt securities including amounts held in qualifying assets by Group insurance companies to meet regulatory requirements.",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the consolidated financial statements (continued)\n\n## 14. Trade and other receivables\n\nTrade and other receivables mainly consist of amounts owed to us by customers and amounts that we pay to our suppliers in advance. Derivative financial instruments with a positive market value are reported within this note as are contract assets, which represent an asset for accrued revenue in respect of goods or services delivered to customers for which a trade receivable does not yet exist, and finance lease receivables recognised where the Group acts as a lessor. See note 20 'Leases' for more information on the Group's leasing activities.\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nTrade receivables represent amounts owed by customers where the right to receive payment is conditional only on the passage of time. Trade receivables that are recovered in instalments from customers over an extended period are discounted at market rates and interest revenue is accreted over the expected repayment period. Other trade receivables do not carry any interest and are stated at their nominal value. When the Group establishes a practice of selling portfolios of receivables from time to time these portfolios are recorded at fair value through other comprehensive income; all other trade receivables are recorded at amortised cost.\n\nThe carrying value of all trade receivables, contract assets and finance lease receivables recorded at amortised cost is reduced by allowances for lifetime estimated credit losses. Estimated future credit losses are first recorded on the initial recognition of a receivable and are based on the ageing of the receivable balances, historical experience and forward looking considerations. Individual balances are written off when management deems them not to be collectible.\n\n|                                                                         | 2024  \u20acm   | 2023  \u20acm   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|------------|\n| Included within non-current assets                                      |            |            |\n| Trade receivables                                                       | 8          | 51         |\n| Trade receivables held at fair value through other comprehensive income | 294        | 337        |\n| Net investment in leases                                                | 211        | 267        |\n| Contract assets                                                         | 450        | 494        |\n| Contract-related costs                                                  | 676        | 690        |\n| Other receivables                                                       | 78         | 66         |\n| Prepayments                                                             | 239        | 296        |\n| Derivative financial instruments 1                                      | 4,011      | 5,642      |\n|                                                                         | 5,967      | 7,843      |\n| Included within current assets                                          |            |            |\n| Trade receivables                                                       | 2,841      | 3,277      |\n| Trade receivables held at fair value through other comprehensive income | 441        | 566        |\n| Net investment in leases                                                | 99         | 106        |\n| Contract assets                                                         | 2,413      | 3,063      |\n| Contract-related costs                                                  | 1,169      | 1,471      |\n| Amounts owed by associates and joint ventures                           | 130        | 175        |\n| Other receivables                                                       | 686        | 730        |\n| Prepayments                                                             | 600        | 835        |\n| Derivative financial instruments 1                                      | 215        | 482        |\n|                                                                         | 8,594      | 10,705     |\n\n## Note:\n\n- 1 Includes \u20ac22 million (2023: \u20ac198 million) of embedded derivative option for which fair value is based on level 3 of the fair value hierarchy (see section on fair value carrying value information within note 22 'Capital and Risk Management').

Provisions\n\nA provision is a liability recorded in the Consolidated statement of financial position, where there is uncertainty over the timing or amount that will be paid, and is therefore often estimated. The main provisions we hold are in relation to asset retirement obligations, which include the cost of returning network infrastructure sites to their original condition at the end of the lease and claims for legal and regulatory matters.\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nProvisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that the Group will be required to settle that obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. Provisions are measured at the Directors' best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the reporting date and are discounted to present value where the effect is material. Where the timing of settlement is uncertain amounts are classified as non-current where settlement is expected more than 12 months from the reporting date.\n\n## Asset retirement obligations\n\nIn the course of the Group's activities, a number of sites and other assets are utilised which are expected to have costs associated with decommissioning. The associated cash outflows are substantially expected to occur at the dates of decommissioning of the assets to which they relate, and are long term in nature.\n\n## Legal and regulatory\n\nThe Group is involved in a number of legal and other disputes, including where the Group has received notifications of possible claims. The Directors of the Company, after taking legal advice, have established provisions considering the facts of each case. For a discussion of certain legal issues potentially affecting the Group see note 29 'Contingent liabilities and legal proceedings' to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Restructuring\n\nThe Group undertakes periodic reviews of its operations and recognises provisions as required based on the outcomes of these reviews. The associated cash outflows for restructuring costs are primarily less than one year.\n\n## Other\n\nComprises various items that do not fall within the Group's other categories of provisions.\n\n|                                          | Asset  retirement  obligations  \u20acm   | Legal and  regulatory  \u20acm   | Restructuring  \u20acm   | Other  \u20acm   | Total  \u20acm   |\n|------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------|---------------------|-------------|-------------|\n| 1 April 2022                             | 1,470                                | 449                         | 302                 | 327         | 2,548       |\n| Exchange movements                       | (22)                                 | (28)                        | -                   | (2)         | (52)        |\n| Disposal of subsidiaries                 | (578)                                | (8)                         | (2)                 | (2)         | (590)       |\n| Amounts capitalised in the year          | 185                                  | -                           | -                   | -           | 185         |\n| Amounts charged to the income statement  | -                                    | 138                         | 425                 | 126         | 689         |\n| Utilised in the year - payments          | (59)                                 | (44)                        | (181)               | (123)       | (407)       |\n| Amounts released to the income statement | (1)                                  | (77)                        | (36)                | (48)        | (162)       |\n| Other                                    | 35                                   | -                           | -                   | -           | 35          |\n| 31 March 2023                            | 1,030                                | 430                         | 508                 | 278         | 2,246       |\n| Exchange movements                       | (7)                                  | (24)                        | 3                   | (3)         | (31)        |\n| Amounts capitalised in the year          | 146                                  | -                           | -                   | -           | 146         |\n| Amounts charged to the income statement  | -                                    | 162                         | 774                 | 206         | 1,142       |\n| Utilised in the year - payments          | (54)                                 | (72)                        | (290)               | (116)       | (532)       |\n| Amounts released to the income statement | (5)                                  | (131)                       | (7)                 | (43)        | (186)       |\n| Transfer to liabilities held for sale    | (177)                                | (96)                        | (46)                | (31)        | (350)       |\n| Other                                    | -                                    | -                           | -                   | 13          | 13          |\n| 31 March 2024                            | 933                                  | 269                         | 942                 | 304         | 2,448       |",

This note describes how the Group accounts for leases and provides details about its lease arrangements.\n\n## Accounting policies\n\n## As a lessee\n\nWhen the Group leases an asset, a 'right-of-use asset' is recognised for the leased item and a lease liability is recognised for any lease payments to be paid over the lease term at the lease commencement date. The right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, being the present value of the lease payments paid or payable, plus any initial direct costs incurred in entering the lease and less any lease incentives received.\n\nRight-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis from the commencement date to the earlier of the end of the asset's useful life or the end of the lease term. The lease term is the non-cancellable period of the lease plus any periods for which the Group is 'reasonably certain' to exercise any extension options (see below). The useful life of the asset is determined in a manner consistent to that for owned property, plant and equipment (as described in note 11 'Property, plant and equipment'). If right-of-use assets are considered to be impaired, the carrying value is reduced accordingly.\n\nLease liabilities are initially measured at the value of the lease payments over the lease term that are not paid at the commencement date and are usually discounted using the incremental borrowing rates of the applicable Group entity (the rate implicit in the lease is used if it is readily determinable). Lease payments included in the lease liability include both fixed payments and in-substance fixed payments during the term of the lease.\n\nAfter initial recognition, the lease liability is recorded at amortised cost using the effective interest method. It is remeasured when there is a change in future lease payments arising from a change in an index or rate (e.g. an inflation related increase) or if the Group's assessment of the lease term changes; any changes in the lease liability as a result of these changes also results in a corresponding change in the recorded right-of-use asset unless the right-of-use asset is reduced to zero in which case the remaining amount of the remeasurement is recognised in profit or loss.\n\nLease modifications that increase the scope of a lease by adding the right to use one or more underlying assets in return for consideration commensurate with the stand-alone price for the additional lease components are treated as separate leases.  If a lease modification decreases the scope of the lease, the Group remeasures both the right-of-use asset and the lease liability and recognises any gain or loss in profit or loss. Other lease modifications result in a remeasurement of the lease liability with an adjustment to the right-of-use asset.  Remeasured lease liabilities are discounted at the modification date using a current discount rate.\n\n## As a lessor\n\nWhere the Group is a lessor, it determines at inception whether the lease is a finance or an operating lease. When a lease transfers substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the underlying asset then the lease is a finance lease; otherwise the lease is an operating lease.\n\nWhere the Group is an intermediate lessor, the interests in the head lease and the sublease are accounted for separately and the lease classification of a sublease is determined by reference to the right-of-use asset arising from the head lease.\n\nIncome from operating leases is recognised on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Income from finance leases is recognised at lease commencement with any interest income recognised over the lease term.\n\nLease income is recognised as revenue for transactions that are part of the Group's ordinary activities (i.e. primarily leases of handsets or other equipment to customers, leases of wholesale access to the Group's fibre and cable networks and leases of tower infrastructure assets). The Group uses IFRS 15 principles to allocate the consideration in contracts between any lease and non-lease components.\n\n## The Group's leasing activities as a lessee\n\nThe Group leases buildings for its retail stores, offices and data centres, land on which to construct mobile base stations, space on mobile base stations to place active RAN equipment and network space (primarily rack space or duct space). In addition, the Group leases fibre and other fixed connectivity to provide internal connectivity for the Group's operations and on a wholesale basis from other operators to provide fixed connectivity services to the Group's customers.\n\nThe Group's general approach to determining lease term by class of asset is described in note 1 'Basis of preparation' under 'Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty'.\n\nMost of the Group's leases include future price increases through fixed percentage increases, indexation to inflation measures on a periodic basis or rent review clauses. Other than fixed percentage increases the lease liability does not reflect the impact of these future increases unless the measurement date has passed. The Group's leases contain no material variable payments clauses other than those related to the number of operators sharing space on third party mobile base stations.",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the consolidated financial statements (continued)\n\n## 20. Leases (continued) 20. Leases (continued)\n\n## Optional lease periods\n\nWhere practicable the Group seeks to include extension or break options in leases to provide operational flexibility, therefore many of the Group's lease contracts contain optional periods. The Group's policy on assessing and reassessing whether it is reasonably certain that the optional period will be included in the lease term is described in note 1 'Basis of preparation' under 'Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty'.\n\nAfter initial recognition of a lease, the Group only reassesses the lease term when there is a significant event or a significant change in circumstances, which was not anticipated at the time of the previous assessment. Significant events or significant changes in circumstances could include merger and acquisition or similar activity, significant expenditure on the leased asset not anticipated in the previous assessment, or detailed management plans indicating a different conclusion on optional periods to the previous assessment. Where a significant event or significant change in circumstances does not occur, the lease term and therefore lease liability and right-of-use asset value, will decline over time.\n\nThe Group's cash outflow for leases in the year ended 31 March 2024 was \u20ac3,567 million (2023 re-presented 1 : \u20ac3,067 million, 2022 re-presented 1 : \u20ac3,018 million) and absent significant future changes in the volume of the Group's activities or other strategic or structural changes to the Group resulting in the use of more or fewer owned assets, this level of cash outflow from leases would be expected to continue for future periods, subject to contractual price increases. The future cash outflows included within lease liabilities are shown in the maturity analysis below. The maturity analysis only includes the reasonably certain payments to be made; cash outflows in these future periods will likely exceed these amounts as payments will be made on optional periods not considered reasonably certain at present and on new leases entered into in future periods.\n\nThe Group's leases for customer connectivity are normally either under regulated access or network sharing or similar preferential access arrangements and as a result the Group normally has significant flexibility over the term it can lease such connections for; generally the notice period required to cancel the lease is less than the notice period included in the service contract with the end customer.  As a result, the Group does not have any significant cash exposure to optional periods on customer connectivity as the Group can cancel the lease when the service agreement ends. In some circumstances the Group is committed to minimum spend amounts for connectivity leases, which are included within reported lease liabilities.\n\n## Sale and leaseback\n\nIn the year ended 31 March 2023, the Group disposed of its interest in Vantage Towers A.G. ('Vantage Towers') into a new joint venture, Oak Holdings 1 GmbH ('Oak'); Vodafone retained an interest of 64.2% in Oak, which owns 89.3% of Vantage Towers (see note 27 'Acquisitions and disposals' for additional details). The Group has agreements with Vantage Towers to lease back spaces on its towers (see note 30 'Related party transactions'). The Group de-recognised assets related to the mobile base stations with a net book value of \u20ac4,793 million. A total net gain on disposal of \u20ac9,287 million was realised in the year ended 31 March 2023 as a result of the disposal of Vantage Towers; \u20ac680 million of this gain, reflecting the gain on the proportion of sold towers retained through the leaseback, was recorded in the year ended 31 March 2023 as a reduction in the value of the right-of-use asset recognised for the leaseback of tower space and will be realised as a reduction in depreciation over the term of the leaseback until November 2028. Other sale and leaseback transactions entered into by the Group were not material, individually or in aggregate.\n\n## Amounts recognised in the primary financial statements in relation to lessee transactions\n\n## Right-of-use assets\n\nThe carrying value of the Group's right-of-use assets, depreciation charge for the year and additions during the year are disclosed in note 11 'Property, plant and equipment'.\n\n## Lease liabilities\n\nThe Group's lease liabilities are disclosed in note 21 'Borrowings'.

The Group does not apply either the short term or low value expedient options in IFRS 16 'Leases'.\n\n## The Group's leasing activities as a lessor\n\nThe Group has a wide range of lessor activities with consumer and enterprise customers, other telecommunication companies and other companies. With consumer and enterprise customers, the Group generates lease income from the provision of handsets, routers and other communications equipment. The Group provides wholesale access to the Group's fibre and cable networks, leases out space on the Group's owned mobile base stations to other telecommunication companies and subleases certain retained mobile base station sites to telecommunication tower companies. In addition, the Group subleases retail stores to franchise partners in certain markets and leases out surplus assets (e.g. vacant offices and retail stores) to other companies.\n\nLessor transactions are classified as operating or finance leases based on whether the lease transfers substantially all of the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the asset. Leases are individually assessed, but generally, the Group's lessor transactions in the year are classified as:\n\n- -Operating leases where the Group provides wholesale access to its fibre and cable networks, provides routers or similar equipment to fixed customers or is lessor of space on owned mobile base stations; and\n- -Finance leases where the Group is sub-lessor of handsets or similar items in back-to-back arrangements or where surplus assets or certain retained mobile base stations sites are sublet out for all or substantially all of the remaining head lease term.\n\nThe Group's income as a lessor in the year is as follows:\n\n|                                                                        | 2024  \u20acm   | Re-presented 1  2023  \u20acm   | Re-presented 1  2022  \u20acm   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|\n| Operating leases                                                       |            |                            |                            |\n| Lease revenue (note 2 'Revenue disaggregation and segmental analysis') | 463        | 673                        | 673                        |\n| Income from leases not recognised as revenue                           | 38         | 37                         | 36                         |\n\nSubstantially all of the Group's income as a lessor is operating lease income.\n\nThe committed amounts to be received from the Group's operating leases are as follows:\n\n|                                                                  | Maturity             | Maturity                 | Maturity                                                | Maturity                                                | Maturity                   | Maturity                     | Maturity   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|------------------------------|------------|\n|                                                                  | Within one  year  \u20acm | In one to two  years  \u20acm | In two to  three years  \u20acm  In three to four  years  \u20acm | In two to  three years  \u20acm  In three to four  years  \u20acm | In four to five  years  \u20acm | In more than  five years  \u20acm | Total  \u20acm  |\n| Committed operating lease payments due to the Group  as a lessor |                      |                          |                                                         |                                                         |                            |                              |            |\n| 31 March 2024                                                    | 296                  | 121                      | 29                                                      | 16                                                      | 9                          | 20                           | 491        |\n| 31 March 2023  Re-presented 2                                    | 275                  | 114                      | 30                                                      | 14                                                      | 7                          | 4                            | 444        |\n| 31 March 2022  Re-presented 2                                    | 487                  | 234                      | 153                                                     | 126                                                     | 113                        | 342                          | 1,455      |\n\nThe Group recognises a net investment in leases (receivables) as a result of providing finance leases as a lessor, which are disclosed in note 14 'Trade and other receivables'.

Borrowings\n\nThe Group's sources of borrowing for funding and liquidity purposes come from a range of committed bank facilities and through short-term and long-term issuances in the capital markets including bond and commercial paper issues and bank loans. Liabilities arising from the Group's lease arrangements are also reported in borrowings; see note 20 'Leases'. We manage the basis on which we incur interest on debt between fixed interest rates and floating interest rates depending on market conditions using interest rate derivatives. The Group enters into foreign exchange contracts to mitigate the impact of exchange rate movements on certain monetary items.\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nInterest-bearing loans and overdrafts are initially measured at fair value (which is equal to cost at inception), and are subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest rate method. Where they are identified as a hedged item in a designated fair value hedge relationship, fair value adjustments are recognised in accordance with our policy (see note 22 'Capital and financial risk management'). Any difference between the proceeds net of transaction costs and the amount due on settlement or redemption of borrowings is recognised over the term of the borrowing.\n\n## Borrowings\n\n|                                               | 2024  \u20acm   | 2023  \u20acm   |\n|-----------------------------------------------|------------|------------|\n| Non-current borrowings                        |            |            |\n| Bonds                                         | 39,451     | 39,512     |\n| Bank loans                                    | 402        | 487        |\n| Lease liabilities (note 20)                   | 7,416      | 10,318     |\n| Other borrowings 1                            | 1,059      | 1,352      |\n|                                               | 48,328     | 51,669     |\n| Current borrowings                            |            |            |\n| Bonds                                         | 1,292      | 4,604      |\n| Bank loans                                    | 365        | 308        |\n| Lease liabilities (note 20)                   | 2,256      | 3,046      |\n| Collateral liabilities                        | 2,628      | 4,886      |\n| Bank borrowings secured against Indian assets | 1,720      | 1,485      |\n| Other borrowings 1                            | 398        | 392        |\n|                                               | 8,659      | 14,721     |\n| Borrowings                                    | 56,987     | 66,390     |\n\nNote:\n\n- 1 Includes \u20ac862 million (2023: \u20ac1,140 million) and \u20ac158 million (2023: \u20ac196 million) of licence and spectrum fees payable in non-current and current borrowings respectively.\n\nThe fair value of the Group's financial liabilities held at amortised cost approximate to fair value with the exception of long-term bonds with a carrying value of \u20ac39,451 million (2023: \u20ac39,512 million) which have a fair value of \u20ac35,885 million (2023: \u20ac35,044 million). Fair value is based on level 1 of the fair value hierarchy using quoted market prices.\n\nThe Group's current borrowings also include \u20ac1,720 million (2023: \u20ac1,485 million) of bank borrowings that are secured against the Group's shareholdings in Indus Towers and Vodafone Idea (see note 12 'Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures' for further details of these assets) and will be repaid through the realisation of proceeds from those assets. This arrangement contains an embedded derivative option which has been separately fair valued and is presented within derivative assets in current assets (see note 14 'Trade and other receivables').\n\nThe Group's borrowings, which include certain bonds that have been designated in hedge relationships, are carried at \u20ac1,229 million higher (2023: \u20ac1,282 million higher) than their euro equivalent redemption value. In addition, where bonds are issued in currencies other than euros, the Group has entered into foreign currency swaps to fix the euro cash outflows on redemption. The impact of these swaps is not reflected in borrowings and would decrease the euro equivalent redemption value of the bonds by \u20ac1,559 million (2023: \u20ac1,440 million).",

The Group does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.\n\n## The Group designates certain derivatives as:\n\n- -hedges of the change in fair value of recognised assets and liabilities ('fair value hedges');\n- -hedges of highly probable forecast transactions or hedges of foreign currency or interest rate risks of firm commitments ('cash flow hedges'); or\n- -hedges of net investments in foreign operations.\n\nDerivative financial instruments are initially measured at fair value on the contract date and are subsequently re-measured to fair value at each reporting date. Changes in values of all derivatives of a financing nature are included within investment income and financing costs in the income statement unless designated in an effective cash flow hedge relationship or a hedge of a net investment in foreign operations when the effective portion of changes in value are deferred to other comprehensive income. Hedge effectiveness is determined at the inception of the hedge relationship, and through periodic prospective effectiveness assessments to ensure that an economic relationship exists between the hedged item and hedging instrument. For fair value hedges, the carrying value of the hedged item is also adjusted for changes in fair value for the hedged risk, with gains and losses recognised in the income statement.\n\nHedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, exercised or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. When hedge accounting is discontinued, any gain or loss recognised in other comprehensive income at that time remains in equity and is recognised in the income statement when the hedged transaction is ultimately recognised in the income statement.\n\nFor cash flow hedges, when the hedged item is recognised in the income statement, amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity for the hedging instrument are reclassified to the income statement. However, when the hedged transaction results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or a non-financial liability, the gains and losses previously recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity are transferred from equity and included in the initial measurement of the cost of the non-financial asset or non-financial liability. If a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the gain or loss accumulated in equity is recognised immediately in the income statement.\n\nFor net investment hedges, gains and losses accumulated in other comprehensive income are included in the income statement when the foreign operation is disposed of.",

These borrowings, together with cash generated from operations, are loaned internally or contributed as equity to certain subsidiaries.\n\n## Dividends from joint ventures and associates and to non-controlling shareholders\n\nDividend policies within shareholder agreements for certain of the Group's associates and joint ventures give the Group certain rights to receive dividends but are generally paid at the discretion of the Board of Directors or shareholders. We do not have existing obligations to pay dividends to non-controlling interest partners of our subsidiaries. The amount of dividends received and paid in the year are disclosed in the consolidated statement of cash flows.\n\n## Sale of trade receivables\n\nDuring the year, the Group sold certain trade receivables to a number of financial institutions. Whilst there are no repurchase obligations in respect of these receivables, the Group provided credit guarantees which would only become payable if default rates were significantly higher than historical rates. The credit guarantee is not considered substantive and substantially all risks and rewards associated with the receivables passed to the purchaser at the date of sale, therefore the receivables were derecognised. The maximum payable under the guarantees at 31 March 2024 was \u20ac1,929 million (2023: \u20ac1,927 million). No provision has been made in respect of these guarantees as the likelihood of a cash outflow has been assessed as remote.\n\n## Supplier financing arrangements\n\nThe Group offers suppliers the opportunity to use supply chain financing ('SCF'). SCF allows suppliers that decide to use it to receive funding earlier than the invoice due date. At 31 March 2024, the financial institutions that run the SCF programmes had purchased \u20ac2.2 billion (2023: \u20ac2.4 billion) of outstanding supplier invoices, principally from larger suppliers. The Group does not provide any financial guarantees to the financial institutions under this programme and continues to cash settle supplier payables in accordance with their contractual terms. As such, the programme does not change the Group's net debt, trade payable balances or cash flows.\n\nThe Group evaluates supplier arrangements against a number of indicators to assess if the payable continues to hold the characteristics of a trade payable or should be classified as borrowings; these indicators include whether the payment terms exceed the shorter of customary payment terms in the industry or 180 days. At 31 March 2024, none of the payables subject to supplier financing arrangements met the criteria to be reclassified as borrowings.\n\n## Financial risk management\n\nThe Group's treasury function centrally manages the Group's funding requirement, net foreign exchange exposure, interest rate management exposures and counterparty risk arising from investments and derivatives. Treasury operations are conducted within a framework of policies and guidelines authorised and reviewed by the Board, most recently in March 2024. A treasury risk committee comprising of the Group's Chief Financial Officer, Group General Counsel and Company Secretary, Group Corporate Finance Director, Group Treasury Director and Group Director of Financial Controlling and Operations meets three times a year to review treasury activities and its members receive management information relating to treasury activities on a quarterly basis. The Group's Internal Auditor reviews the internal control environment regularly.",

Capital and financial risk management (continued)\n\nNo bonds issued by the Group or the Revolving Credit Facilities are subject to financial covenant ratios. Approximately \u20ac32 billion (2023: \u20ac35 billion) of issued bonds have a change of control clause. The Group uses derivative instruments for currency and interest rate risk management purposes that are transacted by specialist treasury personnel. The Group mitigates banking sector credit risk by the use of collateral support agreements.\n\nThe Group's financial risk management policies seek to reduce the Group's exposure to any future disruption to financial markets, including any future impacts from global economic and political uncertainty and other macro economic events.\n\nThe Group has combined cash and cash equivalent and short-term investments of \u20ac9.4 billion, providing significant headroom over short-term liquidity requirements. Additionally the Group maintains undrawn revolving credit facilities of \u20ac7.8 billion euro equivalent. As at 31 March 2024 and after hedging, substantially all the Group's borrowings are held on a fixed interest basis, mitigating exposure to interest rate risk. The Group has no significant currency exposures other than positions in economic hedging relationships. The Group's credit risk under financing activities is spread across a portfolio of highly rated institutions to reduce counterparty exposures and derivative balances are substantially all collateralised. The Group's operating activities result in customer credit risk, for which provisions for expected credit losses are recognised.\n\n## Credit risk\n\nCredit risk is the risk that a counterparty will not meet its obligations under a financial asset leading to a financial loss for the Group. The Group is exposed to credit risk from its operating activities and from its financing activities, the Group considers its maximum exposure to credit risk at 31 March to be:\n\n|                                                 | 2024  \u20acm   | 2023  \u20acm   |\n|-------------------------------------------------|------------|------------|\n| Cash and bank deposits (note 19)                | 4,168      | 3,924      |\n| Money market funds (note 19)                    | 2,015      | 7,781      |\n| Managed investment funds (note 13)              | 2,024      | 2,967      |\n| Bonds and debt securities (note 13)             | 2,142      | 2,337      |\n| Collateral assets (note 13)                     | 741        | 239        |\n| Other investments (note 13)                     | 1,126      | 2,473      |\n| Derivative financial instruments (note 14)      | 4,226      | 6,124      |\n| Trade receivables (note 14) 1                   | 5,513      | 6,158      |\n| Contract assets and other receivables (note 14) | 4,067      | 4,353      |\n| Financial Guarantees 2                          | 2,038      | 3,381      |\n|                                                 | 28,060     | 39,737     |\n\n## Note:\n\n- 1 Includes amounts guaranteed under sales of trade receivables \u20ac1,929 million (2023: \u20ac1,927 million).\n- 2 Principally comprises Vodafone Group Plc's guarantee of the Group's share in a multicurrency loan facility, amounting to US$1 billion and \u20ac0.6 billion (2023: US$1.75 billion), which forms part of its overall joint venture investment in TPG Telecom Ltd. The Group's share of these loan balances is included in the net investment in joint venture (see note 12 'Investments in associates and joint arrangements'). Financial guarantees also includes INR42.5 billion (2023: INR42.5 billion) in relation to the secondary pledge over shares owned by Vodafone Group in Indus Towers (see note 29 'Contingent liabilities and legal proceedings').\n\n## Expected credit loss\n\nThe Group has financial assets classified and measured at amortised cost and fair value through other comprehensive income that are subject to the expected credit loss model requirements of IFRS 9. Cash and bank deposits and certain other investments are both classified and measured at amortised cost and subject to impairment requirements. However, the identified expected credit loss is considered to be immaterial.\n\nInformation about expected credit losses for trade receivables and contract assets can be found under 'Operating activities' on page 195.\n\n## Financing activities\n\nThe Group invests in government securities on the basis they generate a fixed rate of return and are amongst the most creditworthy of investments available.\n\nInvestments are made in accordance with established internal treasury policies which dictate the scaled maximum exposure permissible in relation to an investment's long-term credit rating. The Group invests in AAA unsecured money market mutual funds, where the investment is limited to 10% of each fund; A to AAA government securities, both directly and through money market mutual funds; and has two managed investment funds that hold securities with an average credit quality of AA.\n\nIn respect of financial instruments used by the Group's treasury function, the aggregate credit risk the Group may have with one counterparty is limited by reference to the long-term credit ratings assigned for that counterparty by Moody's, Fitch Ratings and Standard & Poor's. Furthermore, collateral support agreements reduce the Group's exposure to counterparties who must post collateral when there is value due to the Group under outstanding derivative contracts that exceeds a contractually agreed threshold amount. When value is due to the counterparty the Group is required to post collateral on identical terms. Such cash collateral is adjusted daily as necessary.",

Detailed below is the value of the cash collateral, which is reported within current borrowings, held by the Group at 31 March:\n\n|                        | 2024  \u20acm   | 2023  \u20acm   |\n|------------------------|------------|------------|\n| Collateral liabilities | 2,628      | 4,886      |\n\nIn addition, as discussed in note 29 'Contingent liabilities and legal proceedings', the Group has covenanted to provide security in favour of the trustee of the Vodafone Group UK Pension Scheme in respect of the funding deficit in the scheme and pledged security in relation to the Indus Towers merger. The Group has also pledged cash as collateral against derivative financial instruments as disclosed in note 13 'Other investments'.\n\n## Operating activities\n\nCustomer credit risk is managed by the Group's business units which each have policies, procedures and controls relating to customer credit risk management. Outstanding trade receivables and contract assets are regularly reviewed to monitor any changes in credit risk with concentrations of credit risk considered to be limited given that the Group's customer base is large and unrelated. The Group applies the simplified approach and records lifetime expected credit losses for trade receivables and contract assets. Expected credit losses are measured using historical cash collection data for periods of at least 24 months wherever possible and grouped into various customer segments based on product or customer type. The historical loss rates are adjusted where macroeconomic factors, for example changes in interest rates or unemployment rates, or other commercial factors are expected to have a significant impact when determining future expected credit loss rates. For trade receivables the expected credit loss provision is calculated using a provision matrix, in which the provision increases as balances age, and for receivables paid in instalments and contract assets a weighted loss rate is calculated to reflect the period over which the amounts become due for payment by the customer. Trade receivables and contract assets are written off when each business unit determines there to be no reasonable expectation of recovery and enforcement activity has ceased.\n\nMovements in the allowance for expected credit losses during the year were as follows:\n\n|                                                      |          |                                           | Trade receivables held   | Trade receivables held                      | Trade receivables held  at fair value through  other comprehensive income   | Trade receivables held  at fair value through  other comprehensive income   |\n|------------------------------------------------------|----------|-------------------------------------------|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|                                                      | 2024  \u20acm | Contract assets  Re-presented 1  2023  \u20acm | 2024  \u20acm                 | at amortised cost  Re-presented 1  2023  \u20acm | 2024  \u20acm                                                                    | Re-presented 1  2023  \u20acm                                                    |\n| 1 April                                              | 78       | 83                                        | 1,149                    | 1,342                                       | 71                                                                          | 108                                                                         |\n| Exchange movements                                   | (1)      | (3)                                       | (41)                     | (72)                                        | 1                                                                           | 1                                                                           |\n| Amounts charged to credit losses on financial assets | 96       | 128                                       | 419                      | 360                                         | 82                                                                          | 17                                                                          |\n| Transfer of assets held for sale                     | (31)     | 6                                         | (324)                    | 256                                         | (16)                                                                        | 2                                                                           |\n| Other 2                                              | (122)    | (136)                                     | (438)                    | (737)                                       | (60)                                                                        | (57)                                                                        |\n| 31 March                                             | 20       | 78                                        | 765                      | 1,149                                       | 78                                                                          | 71                                                                          |\n\n## Notes:\n\n- 1 The results for the year ended 31 March 2023 have been re-presented to reflect that the results of Vodafone Spain and Vodafone Italy are now reported as discontinued operations.

Capital and financial risk management (continued)\n\n## Liquidity risk\n\nLiquidity is reviewed daily on at least a 12 month rolling basis and stress tested on the assumption that any commercial paper outstanding matures and is not reissued. The Group maintains substantial cash and cash equivalents which at 31 March 2024 amounted to cash \u20ac6.2 billion (2023: \u20ac11.7 billion) and undrawn committed facilities of \u20ac8.0 billion (2023: \u20ac8.0 billion), principally US dollar and euro revolving credit facilities of US$4.0 billion (\u20ac3.7 billion) and \u20ac4.1 billion and which mature in 2028 and 2029 respectively. The Group manages liquidity risk on non-current borrowings by maintaining a varied maturity profile with a cap on the level of debt maturity in any one calendar year, therefore minimising refinancing risk.

There would be no material impact on equity.\n\nAt 31 March 2024, the Group had limited exposure through interest rate derivatives and floating rate bonds referencing LIBOR and other interbank offered rates (IBORs).\n\n## Foreign exchange management\n\nAs Vodafone's primary listing is on the London Stock Exchange its share price is quoted in sterling. Since the sterling share price represents the value of its future multi-currency cash flows, principally in euro, South African rand and sterling, the Group maintains the currency of debt and interest charges in proportion to its expected future principal cash flows and has a policy to hedge external foreign exchange risks on transactions denominated in other currencies above a certain de minimis level.\n\nAt 31 March 2024 6% of net debt was denominated in currencies other than euro (4% South African rand and 2% other). This allows South African rand to be serviced in proportion to expected future cash flows and therefore provides a partial economic hedge against income statement translation exposure.\n\nUnder the Group's foreign exchange management policy, foreign exchange transaction exposure in Group companies is generally maintained at the lower of \u20ac5 million per currency per month or \u20ac15 million per currency over a six month period.\n\nThe Group recognises foreign exchange movements in equity for the translation of net investment hedging instruments and balances treated as investments in foreign operations. However, there is no net impact on equity for exchange rate movements on net investment hedging instruments as there would be an offset in the currency translation of the foreign operation. At 31 March 2024 the Group held financial liabilities in a net investment hedge against the Group's South African rand operations. Sensitivity to foreign exchange movements on the hedging liabilities, analysed against a strengthening of the South African rand by 10% (2023: 12%) would result in a decrease in equity of \u20ac154 million (2023: \u20ac267million) which would be fully offset by foreign exchange movements on the hedged net assets. In addition, cash flow hedges of principally US dollar borrowings would result in an increase in equity of \u20ac73 million (2023: \u20ac204 million) against a strengthening of US dollar by 3% (2023: 5%).\n\nThe Group income statement is exposed to foreign exchange risk from both the generation of profits and losses in currencies other than euro and from the translation of balance sheet items not held in functional currency.\n\nThe following table details the Group's sensitivity to foreign exchange risk. The percentage movement applied to the currency is based on the average movements in the previous three annual reporting periods.\n\n|                                                | 2024  \u20acm   | 2023  \u20acm   |\n|------------------------------------------------|------------|------------|\n| Increase/ (decrease) in Profit before taxation |            |            |\n| EGP 43% change (2023: 27%)                     | 191        | 116        |\n| TRY 54% change (2023: 43%)                     | 104        | 33         |\n| ZAR 10% change (2023: 12%)                     | 60         | 87         |\n| GBP 2% change (2023: 3%)                       | (50)       | (46)       |\n\n## Equity risk\n\nAs noted on page 201, the Group has an embedded derivative option with valuation inputs that include the quoted share prices for Indus Towers and Vodafone Idea. The Group's sensitivity to a 40% increase / decrease in the combined share price input to the option valuation model would result in a decrease / increase in profit before tax of \u20ac19 million / \u20ac137 million (2023: \u20ac116m / \u20ac445 million). The percentage sensitivity applied is based on the 12month volatility of the combined share prices.\n\nThere is no material equity risk relating to the Group's equity investments which are detailed in note 13 'Other investments'.",

Capital and financial risk management (continued)\n\n## Risk management strategy of hedge relationships\n\nThe risk strategies of the designated cash flow, fair value, and net investment hedges reflect the above market risk strategies.\n\nThe objective of the cash flow hedges is principally to convert foreign currency denominated fixed rate borrowings in US dollar, pound sterling, Australian dollar, Swiss franc, Hong Kong dollar, Japanese yen, Norwegian krona and US dollar floating rate borrowings into euro fixed rate borrowings and hedge the foreign exchange spot rate and interest rate risk. There are also cash flow hedges of certain subsidiary expenditure not denominated in functional currency of the entity, to hedge foreign exchange spot risk. Derivative financial instruments designated in cash flow hedges are cross-currency interest rate swaps and foreign exchange swaps and forwards. The swap maturity dates and liquidity profiles of the nominal cash flows match those of the underlying borrowings and exposures.\n\nThe objective of the net investment hedges is to hedge foreign exchange risk in foreign operations. Derivative financial instruments designated in net investment hedges are cross-currency interest rate swaps and foreign exchange swaps. The hedging instruments are rolled on an ongoing basis as determined by the nature of the business.\n\nHedge effectiveness is determined at the inception of the hedge relationship and through periodic prospective effectiveness assessments to ensure that an economic relationship exists between the hedged item and hedging instrument.\n\nFor hedges of foreign currency denominated borrowings and investments, the Group uses a combination of cross-currency and foreign exchange swaps to hedge its exposure to foreign exchange risk and interest rate risk and enters into hedge relationships where the critical terms of the hedging instrument match with the terms of the hedged item. Therefore the Group expects a highly effective hedging relationship with the swap contracts and the value of the corresponding hedged items to change systematically in the opposite direction in response to movements in the underlying exchange rates and interest rates. The Group therefore performs a qualitative assessment of effectiveness. If changes in circumstances affect the terms of the hedged item such that the critical terms no longer match with the critical terms of the hedging instrument, the Group uses the hypothetical derivative method to assess effectiveness.\n\nHedge ineffectiveness may occur due to:\n\n- a)  The fair value of the hedging instrument on the hedge relationship designation date if the fair value is not nil;\n- b) Changes in the contractual terms or timing of the payments on the hedged item; and\n- c)  A change in the credit risk of the Group or the counterparty with the hedging instrument.\n\nThe hedge ratio for each designation will be established by comparing the quantity of the hedging instrument and the quantity of the hedged item to determine their relative weighting; for all of the Group's existing hedge relationships the hedge ratio has been determined as 1:1.\n\nThe fair values of the derivative financial instruments are calculated by discounting the future cash flows to net present values using appropriate market rates and foreign currency rates prevailing at 31 March. The valuation basis is level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. This classification comprises items where fair value is determined from inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset and liability, either directly or indirectly. Derivative financial assets and liabilities are included within trade and other receivables and trade and other payables in the statement of financial position.",

For all financial assets held at amortised cost the carrying values approximate fair value except as disclosed in note 13 'Other investments'.\n\nThe carrying value and valuation basis of the Group's financial liabilities are set out in notes 15 'Trade and other payables' and 21 'Borrowings'. The carrying values approximate fair value for the Group's trade payables and other payables categories. For other financial liabilities a comparison of fair value and carrying value is disclosed in note 21 'Borrowings'.\n\n## Level 3 financial instruments\n\nThe Group's borrowings include \u20ac1,720 million (2023: \u20ac1,485 million) of bank borrowings that are secured against the Group's shareholdings in Indus Towers and Vodafone Idea (see note 12 'Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures' for further details of these assets) and will be repaid through the realisation of proceeds from those assets. This arrangement contains an embedded derivative option which has been separately fair valued. The 31 March 2024 valuation of the embedded derivative asset of \u20ac22 million (2023: \u20ac198 million) is presented within derivative assets in current assets (see note 14 'Trade and other receivables').\n\nA Black Scholes model for European put options has been used as a valuation model and primarily uses market inputs (quoted share prices and volatilities for Indus Towers and Vodafone Idea) along with a strike price equal to the amount payable under the loan. The valuation includes an unobservable adjustment to reflect the potential timeframe to settle the loan and has been modelled using a range of potential durations up to 30 September 2025 (2023: September 2024). As a result of this unobservable adjustment, the option is classified as a level 3 instrument under the fair value hierarchy. An increase/(decrease) in durations applied of 6 months would increase/(decrease) the derivative asset by \u20ac31 million/(\u20ac7 million) (2023: \u20ac141million/(\u20ac115 million)).\n\n## Net financial instruments\n\nThe table below shows the Group's financial assets and liabilities that are subject to offset in the balance sheet and the impact of enforceable master netting or similar agreements.\n\n|                                  |                  |                    |                                          | Related amounts not set off in the balance sheet      | Related amounts not set off in the balance sheet   | Related amounts not set off in the balance sheet   |\n|----------------------------------|------------------|--------------------|------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|\n| At 31 March 2024                 | Gross amount  \u20acm | Amount set off  \u20acm | Amounts  presented in  balance sheet  \u20acm | Right of set off  with derivative  counterparties  \u20acm | Collateral  (liabilities)/assets 1  \u20acm             | Net amount  \u20acm                                     |\n| Derivative financial assets      | 4,226            | -                  | 4,226                                    | (899)                                                 | (2,628)                                            | 699                                                |\n| Derivative financial liabilities | (1,524)          | -                  | (1,524)                                  | 899                                                   | 741                                                | 116                                                |\n| Total                            | 2,702            | -                  | 2,702                                    | -                                                     | (1,887)                                            | 815                                                |\n\n|                                  |                  |                    |                                          | Related amounts  not set off in the  balance sheet    | Related amounts  not set off in the  balance sheet   | Related amounts  not set off in the  balance sheet   |\n|----------------------------------|------------------|--------------------|------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|\n| At 31 March 2023                 | Gross amount  \u20acm | Amount set off  \u20acm | Amounts  presented in  balance sheet  \u20acm | Right of set off  with derivative  counterparties  \u20acm | Collateral  (liabilities)/assets 1  \u20acm               | Net amount  \u20acm                                       |\n| Derivative financial assets      | 6,124            | -                  | 6,124                                    | (910)                                                 | (4,886)                                              | 328                                                  |\n| Derivative financial liabilities | (1,422)          | -                  | (1,422)                                  | 910                                                   | 239                                                  | (273)                                                |\n| Total                            | 4,702            | -                  | 4,702                                    | -                                                     | (4,647)                                              | 55                                                   |\n\nNote:\n\n- 1  Excludes non-cash collateral of \u20ac370 million (2023: \u20acnil) which is not recognised on balance sheet but which would become payable to the Group in the event of a counterparty default on the related derivative financial assets.\n\nFinancial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the consolidated balance sheet when there is a legally enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.

Post employment benefits\n\nThe Group operates a number of Defined Benefit and Defined Contribution retirement plans for our employees. The Group's largest defined benefit plan is in the UK. For further details see 'Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty' in note 1 'Basis of preparation'.\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nFor defined benefit retirement plans, the difference between the fair value of the plan assets and the present value of the plan liabilities is recognised as an asset or a liability on the consolidated statement of financial position. Defined benefit plan liabilities are assessed using the projected unit funding method and applying the principal actuarial assumptions at the reporting period date. Assets are valued at market value.\n\nActuarial gains and losses are taken to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income for defined benefit plans or consolidated income statement for cash leaver plans as incurred. For this purpose, actuarial gains and losses comprise both the effects of changes in actuarial assumptions and experience adjustments arising from differences between the previous actuarial assumptions and what has actually occurred. The return on plan assets, in excess of interest income, and costs incurred for the management of plan assets are also taken to other comprehensive income.\n\nOther movements in the net surplus or deficit are recognised in the consolidated income statement, including the current service cost, any past service cost and the effect of any settlements. The interest cost less the expected interest income on assets is also charged to the consolidated income statement. The amount charged to the consolidated income statement in respect of these plans is included within operating costs or in the Group's share of the results of equity accounted operations, as appropriate.\n\nThe Group's contributions to defined contribution pension plans are charged to the consolidated income statement as they fall due.\n\n## Background\n\nAt 31 March 2024 the Group operated a number of retirement plans for the benefit of its employees throughout the world, with varying rights and obligations depending on the conditions and practices in the countries concerned. The Group's philosophy is to provide access to defined contribution retirement plans where feasible and to manage legacy defined benefit retirement arrangements. Defined benefit plans provide benefits based on the employees' length of pensionable service and their final pensionable salary or other criteria. Defined contribution plans offer employees individual funds that are converted into benefits at the time of retirement.\n\nThe Group operates defined benefit plans in Germany, India, Ireland, Italy 1 , the UK, the United States and defined benefit indemnity plans in Greece and Turkey. Defined contribution plans are currently provided in Egypt, Germany, Greece, India, Ireland, Italy 1 , Portugal, South Africa, Spain 1 and the UK.\n\n## Income statement expense/(income)\n\n|                                                    |   2024  \u20acm |   Re-presented 1  2023  \u20acm | Re-presented 1  2022  \u20acm   |\n|----------------------------------------------------|------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|\n| Defined contribution plans                         |        183 |                        175 | 167                        |\n| Defined benefit plans                              |         34 |                         37 | (29)                       |\n| Total amount charged to income statement (note 24) |        217 |                        212 | 138                        |\n\n## Note:\n\n## Defined benefit plans\n\nThe Group's retirement policy is to provide competitive pension provision, in each operating country, in line with the market median for that location. The Group's preferred retirement provision is focused on Defined Contribution arrangements and/or State provision for future service.\n\nThe Group's main defined benefit funding liability is the Vodafone UK Group Pension Scheme ('Vodafone UK plan'). Since June 2014 the Vodafone UK plan has consisted of two segregated sections: the Vodafone Section and the Cable & Wireless Section ('CWW Section'). Both sections are closed to new entrants and to future accrual. The Group also operates smaller funded and unfunded plans in the UK, funded and unfunded plans in Germany and a funded plan in Ireland. Defined benefit pension provision exposes the Group to actuarial risks such as longer than expected longevity of participants, lower than expected return on investments and higher than expected inflation, which may increase the liabilities or reduce the value of assets of the plans.",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\nThe main defined benefit plans are administered by trustee boards which are legally separate from the Group and consist of representatives who are employees, former employees or are independent from the Group. The trustee boards of the pension plans are required by legislation to act in the best interest of the participants, set the investment strategy and contribution rates and are subject to statutory funding regimes.\n\nThe Vodafone UK plan is registered as an occupational pension plan with HM Revenue and Customs ('HMRC') and is subject to UK legislation and operates within the framework outlined by the Pensions Regulator. UK legislation requires that pension plans are funded prudently and that valuations are undertaken at least every three years. Separate valuations are required for the Vodafone Section and CWW Section.\n\nThe trustees obtain regular actuarial valuations to check whether the statutory funding objective is met and whether a recovery plan is required to restore funding to the level of the agreed technical provisions. The 31 March 2022 triennial actuarial valuation for the Vodafone Section and CWW Section of the Vodafone UK plan showed a net surplus of \u00a3248 million (\u20ac290 million) on the funding basis, comprising of a \u00a397 million (\u20ac113 million) surplus for the Vodafone Section and a \u00a3151 million (\u20ac177 million) surplus for the CWW Section. No further contributions are due in respect of the Vodafone UK plan at this time.  The next actuarial valuation has an effective date of 31 March 2025.\n\nThese plan-specific actuarial valuations differ to the IAS 19 'Employee Benefits' accounting basis, which is used to measure pension assets and liabilities presented in the Group's consolidated statement of financial position.\n\nFunding plans are individually agreed for each of the Group's other defined benefit plans with the respective trustees or governing board, taking into account local regulatory requirements. It is expected that ordinary contributions of \u20ac29 million will be paid into the Group's defined benefit plans during the year ending 31 March 2025. The Group has also provided certain guarantees in respect of the Vodafone UK plan; further details are provided in note 29 'Contingent liabilities and legal proceedings' to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe investment strategy for the UK plans is controlled by the trustees in consultation with the Group and the plans have no direct investments in the Group's equity securities or in property or other assets currently used by the Group. The allocation of assets between different classes of investment is reviewed regularly and is a key factor in the trustee investment policy. The trustees aim to achieve the plan's investment objectives through investing partly in a diversified mix of growth assets which, over the long term, are expected to grow in value by more than the low-risk assets. The low-risk assets include cash and gilts, inflation and interest rate hedging and in-substance insured pensioner annuity policies in both the Vodafone Section and CWW Sections of the Vodafone UK plan and an insured pensioner annuity policy in the Vodafone Ireland Pension Plan. A number of investment managers are appointed to promote diversification by assets, organisation and investment style and current market conditions and trends are regularly assessed, which may lead to adjustments in the asset allocation.\n\nThe key risks in relation to the Vodafone UK plan are set out below, alongside a summary of the steps taken to mitigate each risk.\n\n| Risk description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Mitigation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Investment strategy risk  Underperformance of the investment strategy relative to the  changes in the Vodafone UK Plan's liabilities, which are sensitive to  interest rates and inflation, potentially leading to shortfalls in  meeting pension obligations. | The plan adopts a liability driven investment framework, by investing  in assets that aim to match the characteristics of the Vodafone UK  Plan's liabilities. This can help to hedge the risk of future changes in  interest rate and inflation and also reduce balance sheet volatility.                                                                       |\n| Longevity risk  Pensions paid by the Vodafone UK Plan are guaranteed for life, and,  therefore, if members are expected to live longer, the liabilities  increase.                                                                                             | The Vodafone UK Plan's funding targets include a margin for  prudence to reflect uncertainty in future life expectancy. Both  sections of the Vodafone UK Plan have pensioner annuity policies  which help reduce exposure to changes in longevity. Longevity risk is  also monitored by the trustees on a regular basis through its risk  management framework. |\n| Regulatory risk  Changes in pension regulations and accounting standards can  impact the Group's pension obligations and reporting requirements.                                                                                                               | There is open communication with the trustees and advisors of the  Vodafone UK Plan to understand the impact of any changes in  regulation and to proactively address potential resulting risks.                                                                                                                                                                 |\n\n## Actuarial assumptions\n\nThe Group's plan liabilities are measured using the projected unit credit method using the principal actuarial assumptions set out below:\n\n|                                                           | 2024  %   | 2023  %   | 2022  %   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| Weighted average actuarial assumptions used at 31 March 1 |           |           |           |\n| Rate of inflation 2                                       | 2.9       | 3.0       | 3.3       |\n| Rate of increase in salaries 3                            | 3.0       | 3.0       | 3.1       |\n| Discount rate                                             | 4.5       | 4.5       | 2.5       |\n\n## Notes:\n\n- 1 Figures shown represent a weighted average assumption of the individual plans.

Assets are valued using 'level 2' inputs under IFRS 13 'Fair Value Measurement' principles and classified as unquoted accordingly.\n\nThe fair value of plan assets, which have been measured in accordance with IFRS 13 'Fair Value Measurement', are analysed by asset category above and are subdivided by assets that have a quoted market price in an active market and those that do not, such as investment funds. Where available, the fair values are quoted prices (e.g. listed equity, sovereign debt and corporate bonds). Unlisted investments without quoted prices in an active market (e.g. private equity) are included at values provided by the fund manager in accordance with relevant guidance. Other significant assets are valued based on observable inputs such as yield curves. The Vodafone UK plan annuity policies fully match the pension obligations of those pensioners insured and therefore are set equal to the present value of the related obligations. Investment funds of \u20ac580 million at 31 March 2024 (2023: \u20ac782 million) include investments in diversified alternative beta funds held in the Vodafone Section of the Vodafone UK plan.\n\nThe actual return on plan assets over the year to 31 March 2024 was a gain of \u20ac121 million (2023: \u20ac2,290 million loss).",

The sensitivity analysis below shows how a reasonably possible increase or decrease in a particular assumption would, in isolation, result in an increase or decrease in the present value of the defined benefit obligation as at 31 March 2024.\n\n|                                                                     | Rate of inflation     | Rate of inflation     | Rate of increase in salaries   | Rate of increase in salaries   | Discount rate         | Discount rate         | Life expectancy         | Life expectancy         |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|\n|                                                                     | Decrease  by 0.5%  \u20acm | Increase  by 0.5%  \u20acm | Decrease  by 0.5%  \u20acm          | Increase  by 0.5%  \u20acm          | Decrease  by 0.5%  \u20acm | Increase  by 0.5%  \u20acm | Decrease  by 1 year  \u20acm | Increase  by 1 year  \u20acm |\n| (Decrease)/increase in present  value of defined benefit obligation | (232)                 | 250                   | (2)                            | 3                              | 362                   | (321)                 | (122)                   | 122                     |\n\n## Note:\n\n## 26. Share-based payments\n\nThe Group has a number of share plans used to award shares to Executive Directors and employees as part of their remuneration package. A charge is recognised over the vesting period in the consolidated income statement to record the cost of these, based on the fair value of the award on the grant date.\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nThe Group issues equity-settled share-based awards to certain employees. Equity-settled share-based awards are measured at fair value (excluding the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions) at the date of grant. The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled sharebased award is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Group's estimate of the shares that will eventually vest and adjusted for the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions. A corresponding increase in additional paid-in capital is also recognised.\n\nSome share awards have an attached market condition, based on total shareholder return ('TSR'), which is taken into account when calculating the fair value of the share awards. The valuation for the TSR is based on Vodafone's ranking within the same group of companies, where possible, over the past five years.\n\nThe fair value of awards of non-vested shares is a calculation of the closing price of the Company's shares on the day prior to the grant date, adjusted for the present value of the delay in receiving dividends where appropriate.\n\nThe maximum aggregate number of ordinary shares which may be issued in respect of share options or share plans will not (without shareholder approval) exceed:\n\n- -10% of the ordinary share capital of the Company in issue immediately prior to the date of grant, when aggregated with the total number of ordinary shares which have been allocated in the preceding ten year period under all plans; and\n- -5% of the ordinary share capital of the Company in issue immediately prior to the date of grant, when aggregated with the total number of ordinary shares which have been allocated in the preceding ten year period under all plans, other than any plans which are operated on an all-employee basis.\n\n## Share options\n\nVodafone Sharesave Plan\n\nUnder the Vodafone Sharesave Plan UK staff may acquire shares in the Company through monthly savings of up to \u00a3375 over a three and/or five year period. The savings may then be used to purchase shares at the option price, which is set at the beginning of the invitation period at a discount of up to 20% to the then prevailing market price of the Company's shares.\n\n## Share plans\n\nVodafone Group executive plans\n\nUnder the Vodafone Global Incentive Plan awards of shares are granted to Directors and certain employees. The release of these shares is conditional upon continued employment and for some awards achievement of certain performance targets measured over a three year period.",

The note below provides details of acquisition and disposal transactions for the current year as well as those completed in the prior year. For further details see 'Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty' in note 1 'Basis of preparation' to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Accounting policies Accounting policies\n\n## Businesscombinations Business combinations\n\nAcquisitions of subsidiaries are accounted for using the acquisition method. The cost of the acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the fair values at the date of exchange of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed and equity instruments issued by the Group. Acquisition-related costs are recognised in the consolidated income statement as incurred. The acquiree's identifiable assets and liabilities are recognised at their fair values at the acquisition date, which is the date on which control is transferred to the Group. Goodwill is measured as the excess of the sum of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree and the fair value of the Group's previously held equity interest in the acquiree, if any, over the net amounts of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date. The interest of the non-controlling shareholders in the acquiree may initially be measured either at fair value or at the non-controlling shareholders' proportion of the net fair value of the identifiable assets acquired, liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed. The choice of measurement basis is made on an acquisition-by-acquisition basis. Acquisitions of subsidiaries are accounted for using the acquisition method.

Cash payments or cash receipts relating to these matters must have been made or received by VIL before any amount becomes due from or owed to the Group. Any future payments by the Group to VIL as a result of this agreement would only be made after satisfaction of this and other contractual conditions.  The Group's maximum potential exposure under this mechanism is capped at INR 64 billion (\u20ac713 million).\n\nThe final liability calculation date under the CLAM is 30 June 2025 and no further cash payments are considered probable from the Group as at 31 March 2024.\n\nThe carrying value of the Group's investment in VIL is \u20acnil and the Group is recording no further share of losses in respect of VIL. The Group's potential exposure to liabilities within VIL is capped by the mechanism described above; consequently, contingent liabilities arising from litigation in India concerning the operations of Vodafone India are not reported.\n\n## Indus Towers\n\nUnder the terms of the Indus and Bharti Infratel merger in November 2020, a security package was agreed for the benefit of the newly created merged entity, Indus Towers, which could be invoked in the event that VIL was unable to make MSA payments. The remaining element of the security package is a secondary pledge over shares owned by Vodafone Group in Indus Towers, ranking behind Vodafone's existing lenders for the outstanding bank borrowings of \u20ac1.7 billion as at 31 March 2024 secured against Indian assets ('the bank borrowings'), with a maximum liability cap of INR 42.5 billion (\u20ac472 million).  In the event of non-payment of relevant MSA obligations by VIL, Indus Towers would have recourse to any secondary pledged shares, after repayment of the bank borrowings in full, up to the value of the liability cap.\n\n## Legal Proceedings\n\nThe Group is currently involved in a number of legal proceedings, including inquiries from, or discussions with, government authorities that are incidental to its operations.\n\nLegal proceedings where the Group considers that the likelihood of material future outflows of cash or other resources is more than remote are disclosed below. Where the Group assesses that it is probable that the outcome of legal proceedings will result in a financial outflow, and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of that obligation, a provision is recognised for these amounts.\n\nIn all cases, determining the probability of successfully defending a claim against the Group involves the application of judgement as the outcome is inherently uncertain. The determination of the value of any future outflows of cash or other resources, and the timing of such outflows, involves the use of estimates. The costs incurred in complex legal proceedings, regardless of outcome, can be significant.\n\nThe Group is not involved in any material proceedings in which any of the Group's Directors, members of senior management or affiliates are either a party adverse to the Group or have a material interest adverse to the Group.\n\n## Tax cases\n\n## VISPL tax claims\n\nVodafone India Services Private Limited ('VISPL') is involved in a number of tax cases. The total value of the claims is approximately \u20ac468 million plus interest, and penalties of up to 300% of the principal.\n\nOf the individual tax claims, the most significant is for approximately \u20ac238 million (plus interest of \u20ac672 million), which VISPL has been assessed as owing in respect of: (i) the sale of an international call centre by VISPL to Hutchison Telecommunications International Limited group ('HTIL'); and (ii) the acquisition of and/or the alleged transfer of options held by VISPL in Vodafone India Limited. Item (i) is subject to an indemnity by HTIL. Item (ii), which forms the largest part of the potential claim, is not subject to any indemnity. A stay of the tax demand was obtained following a deposit of INR 2,000 million (\u20ac22 million) being paid, and a corporate guarantee being provided by Vodafone International Holdings BV ('VIHBV') for the balance of tax assessed. On 8 October 2015, the Bombay High Court ruled in favour of Vodafone in relation to the options and the call centre sale. The Indian Tax Authority has appealed to the Supreme Court of India. The appeal hearing has been adjourned indefinitely. A claim in respect of the transfer pricing margin charged for the international call centre of HTIL prior to the 2007 transaction with Vodafone for HTIL assets in India has now been settled.\n\nWhile there is some uncertainty as to the outcome of the remaining tax cases involving VISPL, the Group believes it has valid defences and does not consider it probable that a financial outflow will be required to settle these cases.\n\n## Netherlands tax case\n\nVodafone Europe BV ('VEBV') received assessments totalling \u20ac267 million of tax and interest from the Dutch tax authorities, who challenged the application of the arm's length principle in relation to various intra-group financing transactions. The Group entered into a guarantee for the full value of the assessments issued. VEBV appealed against these assessments to the District Court of the Hague where a hearing was held in March 2023. The District Court issued its judgement in July 2023, upholding VEBV's appeal in relation to the majority of issues and requiring the Dutch tax authorities to significantly reduce its assessments. VEBV and the Dutch tax authorities have since appealed the judgement. The appeal hearing date is not yet known but is expected to be before the end of 2024.\n\nThe Group continues to believe it has robust defences but has recorded a provision of \u20ac24 million for tax and interest, reflecting the Group's current view of the probable financial outflow required to fully resolve the issue and has reduced the guarantee to the same value.",

The claims seek damages of up to \u20ac5,000 per contract for GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) infringement.

Lawsuits which the Papistas claimants had previously brought against Vodafone Greece, including one also citing Vodafone Group Plc and certain Directors and officers of Vodafone as defendants, were either withdrawn or left dormant. Vodafone Greece filed a counter claim and all claims were heard in February 2020. All of the Papistas claims were rejected by the Athens Court of First Instance because the stamp duty payments required to have the merits of the case considered had not been made.  Vodafone Greece's counter claim was also rejected. The Papistas claimants and Vodafone Greece each filed appeals. The appeal hearings took place on 23 February and 11 May 2023. Judgement has been received and the Court dismissed both of the appeals because the stamp duty payments had again not been made, except for one aspect of the proceedings which will be dealt with at a further hearing in February 2025. Whether the Papistas claimants will appeal the judgement is unknown as at the date of this report.\n\nVodafone is continuing vigorously to defend the claims and based on the progress of the litigation so far the Group believes that it is highly unlikely that there will be an adverse ruling for the Group. On this basis, the Group does not expect the outcome of these claims to have a material financial impact.\n\n## UK: Phones 4U in Administration v Vodafone Limited, Vodafone Group Plc and Others\n\nIn December 2018, the administrators of former UK indirect seller, Phones 4U, sued the three main UK mobile network operators ('MNOs'), including Vodafone, and their parent companies in the English High Court. The administrators alleged collusion between the MNOs to withdraw their business from Phones 4U thereby causing its collapse. The judge ordered that there should be a split trial between liability and damages. The first trial on liability took place from May to July 2022. On 10 November 2023, the High Court issued a judgement in Vodafone's favour and rejected Phones 4U's allegations that the defendants were in breach of competition law, consistent with Vodafone's previously stated position that a present obligation does not exist. Phones 4U has been granted permission to appeal the judgement from the Court of Appeal. The appeal hearing will take place in May 2025.\n\nThe Group intends to vigorously defend the appeal and is not able to estimate any possible loss in the event of an adverse judgement on appeal.\n\n## South Africa: Kenneth Makate v Vodacom (Pty) Limited\n\nMr Kenneth Makate, a former employee of Vodacom Pty Limited ('Vodacom South Africa'), started legal proceedings in 2008 claiming compensation for a business idea that led to the development of a service known as 'Please Call Me' ('PCM'). In July 2014, the Gauteng High Court ('the High Court') ruled that Mr Makate had proven the existence of a contract, but that Vodacom South Africa was not bound by that contract because the responsible director did not have authority to enter into such an agreement on Vodacom South Africa's behalf. The High Court and Supreme Court of Appeal ('the SCA') turned down Mr Makate's application for leave to appeal in December 2014 and March 2015, respectively.\n\nIn April 2016, the Constitutional Court of South Africa ('the Constitutional Court') granted leave to appeal and upheld Mr Makate's appeal. It found that Vodacom South Africa is bound by an agreement and ordered the parties to negotiate, in good faith, and agree a reasonable compensation amount payable to Mr Makate or, in the event of a deadlock, for the matter to be referred to Vodacom Group's Chief Executive Officer ('the CEO') for determination. Mr Makate's application for the aforementioned order to be varied from the determination of an amount to a compensation model based on a share of revenue, was dismissed by the Constitutional Court. In accordance with the Constitutional Court order, and after negotiations failed, the CEO issued his determination on 9 January 2019. However, the CEO's award of R47 million (\u20ac2 million) was rejected by Mr Makate, who subsequently brought an application in the High Court for judicial review against the CEO's determination and award.\n\nThe High Court, in a judgement delivered on 8 February 2022, set aside the CEO's determination and ordered him to reassess the amount employing a set of criteria which would have resulted in the payment of a higher compensation amount, for the benefit of Mr Makate, than that determined by the CEO. Vodacom South Africa appealed against the judgement and the order of the High Court to the SCA. The SCA heard the appeal on 9 May 2023 and its judgement was handed down on 6 February 2024. A majority of three judges, with a minority of two judges dissenting, dismissed the appeal and ruled that Mr Makate is entitled to be paid 5% - 7.5% of the total revenue of the PCM product from March 2001 to the date of the judgement, plus interest.\n\nOn 27 February 2024, Vodacom South Africa applied for leave to appeal the judgement and order of the SCA to the Constitutional Court, resulting in the suspension of the operation of the judgement and order of the SCA. Mr Makate is opposing Vodacom South Africa's application for leave to appeal. Vodacom South Africa is challenging the SCA's judgement and order on various grounds including, but not limited to the SCA ignoring the evidence placed before it on the computation of the quantum of compensation payable to Mr Makate, and the SCA issuing orders that are legally unenforceable.\n\nThe CEO's determination in 2019 amounted to R47 million (\u20ac2 million). The minority judgement of the SCA raised Mr Makate's compensation to approximately R186 million (\u20ac9 million), while the SCA majority judgement would entitle Mr Makate to a minimum compensation amount of R29 billion (\u20ac1.4 billion). Consequently, the range of the possible compensation outcomes in this matter is very wide.\n\nThe amount ultimately payable to Mr Makate is uncertain and will depend on the determination of the Constitutional Court to grant Vodacom South Africa's application for leave to appeal and, if granted, on the success of Vodacom South Africa's appeal against the judgement and order of the SCA, on the merits of the case. The Group is continuing to challenge the level of compensation payable to Mr Makate and a provision immaterial to the financial statements has been recorded.",

Related undertakings\n\n## A full list of all of our subsidiaries, joint arrangements and associated undertakings is detailed below.\n\nA full list of subsidiaries, joint arrangements and associated undertakings (as defined in the Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008) as at 31 March 2024 is detailed below. No subsidiaries are excluded from the Group consolidation. Unless otherwise stated the Company's subsidiaries all have share capital consisting solely of ordinary shares and are indirectly held. The percentage held by Group companies reflect both the proportion of nominal capital and voting rights unless otherwise stated. Summarised financial information is provided in respect of the Group's most significant joint arrangements and associates in note 12 'Investments in associates and joint arrangements'.\n\n## Subsidiaries\n\nA subsidiary is an entity directly or indirectly controlled by the Company. Control is achieved where the Company has existing rights that give it the current ability to direct the activities that affect the Company's returns and exposure or rights to variable returns from the entity. The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate. Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring their accounting policies into line with those used by the Group. All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation. Non-controlling interests in the net assets of consolidated subsidiaries are identified separately from the Group's equity therein. Non-controlling interests consist of the amount of those interests at the date of the original business combination and the non-controlling shareholder's share of changes in equity since the date of the combination. Total comprehensive income is attributed to non-controlling interests even if this results in the non-controlling interests having a deficit balance.\n\n% of share class held by Group Companies\n\nCompany name\n\nShare Class\n\n## Albania\n\n## Cyprus\n\n## Autostrada Tirane-Durres, Rruga: \u0204Pavaresia\u0205, Nr 61, Kashar, Tirana,Albania\n\nVodafone Albania Sh.A\n\n100.00\n\nOrdinary shares\n\n## Rruga \u0204Ibrahim Rugova\u0205, Sky Tower, Kati i 5, Hyrja 2, Tiran\u00eb, 1000, Albania\n\n\\_VOIS Albania Shpk.\n\n100.00\n\nOrdinary shares\n\n## Australia\n\n## Mills Oakley, Level 7, 151 Clarence Street, Sydney NSW 2000, Australia\n\nVodafone Enterprise Australia Pty\n\nLimited\n\n100.00\n\nOrdinary shares\n\n## Austria\n\n## c/vo EvVodaersheds Sutherland Rechtsanw\u00e4lte GmbH, K\u00e4rntner Ring 12, 3.

Basis of preparation\n\nThe separate financial statements of the Company are drawn up in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 and Financial Reporting Standard 101 'Reduced disclosure framework', ('FRS 101'). The Company will continue to prepare its financial statements in accordance with FRS 101 on an ongoing basis until such time as it notifies shareholders of any change to its chosen accounting framework.\n\nThe Company financial statements have been prepared using the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of certain financial assets and financial liabilities and in accordance with the UK Companies Act 2006. The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis.\n\nThe  following  exemptions  available  under  FRS  101  have  been  applied:\n\n- -Paragraphs 45(b) and 46 to 52 of IFRS 2, 'Shared-based payment' (details of the number and weighted-average exercise prices of share options, and how the fair value of goods or services received was determined);\n- -IFRS 7 'Financial Instruments: Disclosures';\n- -Paragraph 91 to 99 of IFRS 13, 'Fair value measurement' (disclosure of valuation techniques and inputs used for fair value measurement of assets and liabilities);\n- -Paragraph 38 of IAS 1  'Presentation of financial statements' comparative information requirements in respect of paragraph 79(a)(iv) of IAS 1;\n- -The following paragraphs of IAS 1 'Presentation of financial statements':\n- -10(d) (statement of cash flows);\n- -16 (statement of compliance with all IFRS);\n- -38A (requirement for minimum of two primary statements, including cash flow statements);\n- -38B-D (additional comparative information);\n- -40A-D (requirements for a third statement of financial position);\n- -111 (cash flow statement information); and\n- -134-136 (capital management disclosures).\n- -IAS 7 'Statement of cash flows';\n- -Paragraph 30 and 31 of IAS 8 'Accounting policies, changes in accounting estimates and errors' (requirement for the disclosure of information when an entity has not applied a new IFRS that has been issued but is not yet effective);\n- -The requirements in IAS 24 'Related party disclosures' to disclose related party transactions entered into between two or more members of a group;\n- -The requirements in IAS 36 'Impairment of asset' to disclose valuation technique and assumptions used in determining recoverable amount.\n\nAs  permitted  by  section  408(3)  of  the  Companies  Act  2006,  the  income  statement  of  the  Company  is  not  presented  in  this  Annual  Report. These  separate  financial  statements  are  not  intended  to  give  a  true  and  fair  view  of  the  profit  or  loss  or  cash  flows  of  the  Company.  The  Company has  not  published  its  individual  cash  flow  statement  as  its  liquidity,  solvency  and  financial  adaptability  are  dependent  on  the  Group  rather  than  its own  cash  flows.\n\n## Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty\n\nThe preparation of Company financial statements in conformity with FRS 101 requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the Company financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods. Management regularly reviews the accounting judgements and critical estimates that could potentially significantly impact the amounts recognised in the financial statements and give rise to material adjustments in the Company's financial statements.\n\nA source of estimation uncertainty for the Company relates to the review for impairment of investment carrying values and the estimates used when determining the recoverable value of the investment. However, there is not considered to be a significant risk of material adjustment from revisions to these assumptions within the next financial year (see note 2 'Fixed assets').\n\nStrategic report\n\nGovernance\n\nFinancials",

Current tax, including UK corporation tax and foreign tax, is provided at amounts expected to be paid (or recovered) using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting period date.\n\nDeferred tax is provided in full on temporary differences that exist at the reporting period date and that result in an obligation to pay more tax, or a right to pay less tax in the future. The deferred tax is measured at the rate expected to apply in the periods in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse, based on the tax rates and laws that are enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting period date. Temporary differences arise from the inclusion of items of income and expenditure in taxation computations in periods different from those in which they are included in the Company financial statements. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is regarded as more likely than not that they will be recovered. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted.

Financial assets and financial liabilities, in respect of financial instruments, are recognised on the Company statement of financial position when the Company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.\n\n## Financial liabilities and equity instruments Financial liabilities and equity instruments\n\nFinancial liabilities and equity instruments issued by the Company are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into and the definitions of a financial liability and an equity instrument. An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Company after deducting all of its liabilities and includes no obligation to deliver cash or other financial assets. The accounting policies adopted for specific financial liabilities and equity instruments are set out below.

The Company's activities expose it to the financial risks of changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates which it manages using derivative financial instruments.\n\nThe use of derivative financial instruments is governed by the Group's policies approved by the Board of Directors, which provide written principles on the use of derivative financial instruments consistent with the Group's risk management strategy. Changes in values of all derivative financial instruments are included within the income statement unless designated in an effective cash flow hedge relationship when changes in value are deferred to other comprehensive income or equity respectively.

The Company does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.\n\nDerivative financial instruments are initially measured at fair value on the contract date and are subsequently remeasured to fair value at each reporting date. The Company designates certain derivatives as hedges of the change of fair value of recognised assets and liabilities ('fair value hedges') or hedges of highly probable forecast transactions or hedges of foreign currency or interest rate risks of firm commitments ('cash flow hedges'). Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, exercised or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.

Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, exercised or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.\n\n## Fair value hedges Fair value hedges\n\nTheCompany's policy is to use derivative financial instruments (primarily interest rate swaps) to convert a proportion of its fixed rate debt to floating rates in order to hedge the interest rate risk arising, principally, from capital market borrowings. The Company designates these as fair value hedges of interest rate risk with changes in fair value of the hedging instrument recognised in the income statement for the period together with the changes in the fair value of the hedged item due to the hedged risk, to the extent the hedge is effective. Gains and losses relating to any ineffective portion are recognised immediately in the income statement.

The portion of gains or losses relating to changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as effective cash flow hedges is recognised in other comprehensive income; gains or losses relating to any ineffective portion are recognised immediately in the income statement. However, when the hedged transaction results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or a non-financial liability, the gains and losses previously recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity are transferred from equity and included in the initial measurement of the cost of the non-financial asset or nonfinancial liability. When the hedged item is recognised in the income statement, amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity for the hedging instrument are reclassified to the income statement. When hedge accounting is discontinued, any gain or loss recognised in other comprehensive income at that time remains in equity and is recognised in the income statement when the hedged transaction is ultimately recognised in the income statement. If a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the gain or loss accumulated in equity is recognised immediately in the income statement.\n\nNew accounting pronouncements\n\nTo the extent applicable the Company will adopt new accounting policies as set out in note 1 'Basis of preparation' in the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## 2. Fixed assets\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nShares in Group undertakings are stated at cost less any provision for impairment and capital related to share-based payments. Contributions in respect of share-based payments are recognised in line with the policy set out in note 7 'Share-based payments'.\n\nThe Company assesses investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an investment may not be recoverable. If any such indication of impairment exists, the Company makes an estimate of the recoverable amount. If the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than the value of the investment, the investment is considered to be impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised immediately in the income statement.\n\nWhere there has been a change in the estimates used to determine recoverable amount and an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the cash-generating unit is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, not to exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the cash-generating unit in prior years and an impairment loss reversal is recognised immediately in the income statement.\n\nThe Company applies the same methodology and assumptions used by the Group for goodwill impairment testing purposes, as set out in note 4 'Impairment losses' to the consolidated financial statements. For the purposes of the Company's own impairment assessment, the Group's operations are considered to be a single cash generating unit ('CGU') held within the Company's principal subsidiary, Vodafone European Investments. The pooling of the Company's interests within a single CGU significantly reduces the risk that movements in individual assumptions used during the goodwill impairment testing will impact the result of the investment impairment assessment. Whilst the underlying assumptions used are a source of estimation uncertainty, they do not give rise to a significant risk of adjustment within the next financial year.\n\n## Shares in Group undertakings\n\n|                                                            | 2024   \u20acm   | 2023   \u20acm   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|\n| Cost                                                       |             |             |\n| 1 April                                                    | 84,471      | 84,334      |\n| Additions                                                  | -           | 782         |\n| Disposals                                                  | (261)       | (667)       |\n| Capital contributions arising from share-based payments    | 115         | 135         |\n| Contributions received in relation to share-based payments | (72)        | (113)       |\n| 31 March                                                   | 84,253      | 84,471      |\n| Accumulated impairment losses                              |             |             |\n| 1 April                                                    | 1,044       | 928         |\n| Disposals                                                  | (261)       | -           |\n| Impairment loss recognised 1                               | -           | 116         |\n| 31 March                                                   | 783         | 1,044       |\n| Net book value                                             |             |             |\n| 31 March                                                   | 83,470      | 83,427      |\n\nNote:\n\n1. \u20ac116 million of capital contribution and resulting impairment related to an intercompany reorganisation exercise completed during the prior year.\n\n## At 31 March 2024 the Company had the following principal subsidiary:\n\n| Name                          | Principal activity   | Country of incorporation   |   Percentage shareholding |\n|-------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------------|---------------------------|\n| Vodafone European Investments | Holding Company      | England                    |                       100 |\n\nDetails  of  direct  and  indirect  related  undertakings  are  set  out  in  note  31  'Related  undertakings'  to  the  consolidated  financial  statements.",

The market value of shares held was \u20ac1,434 million (2023: \u20ac1,855 million). During the year, 87,129,475 (2023: 85,844,124) treasury shares were reissued under Group share schemes and no (2023: 1,463,959,031) shares were repurchased under the 2022 scheme which completed on 15 March 2023.\n\nOn 15 March 2024, the Group announced that the Board has approved the capital return through share buybacks of up to \u20ac2 billion of proceeds from the sale of Vodafone Spain. This is expected to commence following the completion of the sale of Vodafone Spain.\n\n## -7. Share -based payments\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nThe Group operates a number of equity-settled share-based payment plans for the employees of subsidiaries using the Company's equity instruments. The fair value of the compensation given in respect of these share-based payment plans is recognised as a capital contribution to the Company's subsidiaries over the vesting period. The capital contribution is reduced by any payments received from subsidiaries in respect of these share-based payments.\n\nThe Company currently uses a number of equity-settled share plans to grant options and shares to the Directors and employees of its subsidiaries.\n\nAt 31 March 2024 the Company had 70 million ordinary share options outstanding (2023: 62 million).\n\nThe Company has made capital contributions to its subsidiaries in relation to share-based payments. At 31 March 2024, the cumulative capital contribution net of payments received from subsidiaries was \u20ac304 million (2023: \u20ac261 million). During the year ended 31 March 2024, the total capital contribution arising from share-based payments was \u20ac115 million (2023: \u20ac135 million), with payments of \u20ac72 million (2023: \u20ac113 million) received from subsidiaries.\n\nFull details of share-based payments, share option schemes and share plans are disclosed in note 26 'Share-based payments' to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## 8. Reserves\n\nThe Board is responsible for the Group's capital management including the approval of dividends. This includes an assessment of both the level of reserves legally available for distribution and consideration as to whether the Company would be solvent and retain sufficient liquidity following any proposed distribution.\n\nAs Vodafone Group Plc is a Group holding company with no direct operations, its ability to make shareholder distributions is dependent on its ability to receive funds for such purposes from its subsidiaries in a manner which creates profits available for distribution for the Company. The major factors that impact the ability of the Company to access profits held in subsidiary companies at an appropriate level to fulfil its needs for distributable reserves on an ongoing basis include:\n\n- -the absolute size of the profit pools either currently available for distribution or capable of realisation into distributable reserves in the relevant entities;\n- -the location of these entities in the Group's corporate structure;\n- -profit and cash flow generation in those entities; and\n- -the risk of adverse changes in business valuations giving rise to investment impairment charges, reducing profits available for distribution.\n\nThe Group's consolidated reserves set out on page 137 do not reflect the profits available for distribution in the Group.",

The use of electronic communications, rather than printed paper documents, means information about the Company can be accessed through emails or the Company's website, thus supporting our efforts to reduce our impact on the environment.\n\nSee vodafone.com/investor\n\nfor further details\n\nA growing number of our shareholders have opted to receive communications from us electronically. Shareholders who have done so will be sent an email alert containing a link to the relevant documents.\n\nWe encourage all our shareholders to sign up for this service. You can register for this service at shareview.co.uk or by contacting Equiniti on the telephone number provided on the left of this page.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSee vodafone.com/investor\n\nfor further information about this service\n\n## ShareGift\n\nWe support ShareGift, the charity share donation scheme (registered charity number 1052686). Through ShareGift, shareholders who have only a very small number of shares, which might be considered uneconomic to sell, are able to donate them to charity. Donated shares are aggregated and sold by ShareGift, with the proceeds being passed on to a wide range of UK charities.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSee sharegift.org or call +44 (0)20 7930 3737\n\nfor further details\n\n## Warning to shareholders ('boiler room' scams)\n\nOver recent years, we have become aware of investors who have received unsolicited calls or correspondence, in some cases purporting to have been issued by us, concerning investment matters. These callers typically make claims of highly profitable investment opportunities that turn out to be worthless or simply do not exist. These approaches are usually made by unauthorised companies and individuals and are commonly known as 'boiler room' scams. Investors are advised to be wary of any unsolicited advice or offers to buy shares. If it sounds too good to be true, it often is.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSee the FCA website at fca.org.uk/scamsmart for\n\nmore detailed information about this or similar activities\n\n## Dividends\n\nRead more on the dividend amount per share on pages 31 and 168.\n\n## Euro dividends\n\nDividends are declared in euros to align with the functional currency of the Company, and paid in euros and pounds sterling according to where the shareholder is resident. Cash dividends to ADS holders are paid by the ADS depositary bank in US dollars. The foreign exchange rates at which dividends declared in euros are converted into pounds sterling and US dollars are calculated based on the average exchange rate of the five business days during the week prior to the payment of the dividend.\n\n## Payment of dividends by direct credit\n\nWe pay cash dividends directly to shareholders' bank or building society accounts. This ensures secure delivery and means dividend payments are credited to shareholders\u0202 designated accounts on the same day payment is made. For ordinary shareholders, a dividend confirmation covering both the interim and final dividends paid during the financial year is sent to shareholders at the time of the interim dividend in February.\n\n## Dividend reinvestment plan\n\nWe offer a dividend reinvestment plan which allows holders of ordinary shares who choose to participate to use their cash dividends to acquire additional shares in the Company. These are purchased on their behalf by the plan administrator, Equiniti, through a low-cost dealing arrangement. For ADS holders, J.P. Morgan, through its transfer agent, EQ Shareowner Services, maintains the Global Invest Direct Program, which is a direct purchase and sale plan for depositary receipts with a dividend reinvestment facility.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSee vodafone.com/dividends for further\n\ninformation about dividend payments",

Morgan, as custodian of our ADR program and (ii) e&, BlackRock, Inc., Liberty Global plc and Norges Bank (as described above).\n\nThe rights attaching to the ordinary shares of the Company held by these shareholders are identical in all respects to the rights attaching to all the ordinary shares of the Company. As at 13 May 2024, the Directors are not aware of any other interest of 3% or more in the ordinary share capital of the Company. The Company is not directly or indirectly owned or controlled by any foreign government or any other legal entity. There are no arrangements known to the Company that could result in a change of control of the Company.\n\n## Other information\n\n## Articles of Association and applicable English law\n\nThe following description summarises certain provisions of the Company\u0202s Articles of Association and applicable English law. This summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Companies Act 2006 and the Company's Articles of Association. The Company is a public limited company under the laws of England and Wales. The Company is registered in England and Wales under the name Vodafone Group Public Limited Company with the registration number 1833679.\n\nFull details of where copies of the Articles of Association can be obtained are detailed on page 252 under 'Documents on display'.\n\nAll of the Company's ordinary shares are fully paid. Accordingly, no further contribution of capital may be required by the Company from the holders of such shares.\n\nEnglish law specifies that any alteration to the Articles of Association must be approved by a special resolution of the Company\u0202s shareholders.\n\n## Articles of Association\n\nThe Company's Articles of Association do not specifically restrict the objects of the Company.\n\n## Directors\n\nThe Directors are empowered under the Articles of Association to exercise all the powers of the Company subject to any restrictions in the Articles of Association, the Companies Act 2006 (as defined in the Articles of Association) and any special resolution.\n\nUnder the Company's Articles of Association, a Director cannot vote in respect of any proposal in which the Director, or any person connected with the Director, has a material interest other than by virtue of the Director's interest in the Company's shares or other securities. However, this restriction on voting does not apply in certain circumstances as set out in the Articles of Association.\n\nThe Directors are empowered to exercise all the powers of the Company to borrow money, subject to the limitation that the aggregate amount of all liabilities and obligations of the Group outstanding at any time shall not exceed an amount equal to 1.5 times the aggregate of the Group's share capital and reserves calculated in the manner prescribed in the Articles of Association, unless sanctioned by an ordinary resolution of the Company's shareholders.\n\n## Purchase of own shares\n\nThe Company can make market purchases of its own shares or agree to do so in the future provided it is duly authorised by its members in a general meeting and subject to and in accordance with section 701 of the Companies Act 2006. Such authority was given at the 2023 AGM.",

A fixed cumulative preferential dividend may only be paid out of available distributable profits that the Directors have resolved should be distributed.\n\nThe fixed rate shares do not have any other right to share in the Company's profits.\n\nHolders of the Company's ordinary shares may, by ordinary resolution, declare dividends but may not declare dividends in excess of the amount recommended by the Directors. The Board of Directors may also pay interim dividends. No dividend may be paid other than out of profits available for distribution.\n\nDividends on ordinary shares can be paid to shareholders in whichever currency the Directors decide, using an appropriate exchange rate for any currency conversions that are required.\n\nIf a dividend has not been claimed for one year after the date of the resolution passed at a general meeting declaring that dividend or the resolution of the Directors providing for payment of that dividend, the Directors may invest the dividend or use it in some other way for the benefit of the Company until the dividend is claimed. If the dividend remains unclaimed for 12 years after the relevant resolution either declaring that dividend or providing for payment of that dividend, it will be forfeited and belong to the Company.\n\n## Voting rights\n\nAt a general meeting of the Company, when voting on substantive resolutions (i.e. any resolution that is not a procedural resolution) each shareholder who is entitled to vote and is present in person or by proxy has one vote for every share held (a poll vote). Procedural resolutions (such as a resolution to adjourn a general meeting or a resolution on the choice of Chair of a general meeting) shall be decided on a show of hands, where each shareholder who is present at the meeting has one vote regardless of the number of shares held, unless a poll is demanded.\n\nShareholders entitled to vote at general meetings may appoint proxies who are entitled to vote, attend and speak at general meetings. Two shareholders present in person or by proxy constitute a quorum for purposes of a general meeting of the Company.\n\nUnder English law, shareholders of a public company such as the Company are not permitted to pass resolutions by written consent. Record holders of the Company's ADSs are entitled to attend, speak and vote on a poll or a show of hands at any general meeting of the Company's shareholders by the depositary's appointment of them as corporate representatives or proxies with respect to the underlying ordinary shares represented by their ADSs. Alternatively, holders of ADSs are entitled to vote by supplying their voting instructions to the depositary or its nominee who will vote the ordinary shares underlying their ADSs in accordance with their instructions.\n\nHolders of the Company's ADSs are entitled to receive notices of shareholders' meetings under the terms of the deposit agreement relating to the ADSs.\n\nEmployees who hold vested shares in an EquatePlus account are able to vote by submitting instructions online through the EquatePlus platform. Note there are two vested share accounts with Computershare (SPA, in respect of shares arising from a SAYE exercise, and MyShareBank, in respect of vested shares from the Global Incentive Plan).\n\nHolders of the Company's 7% cumulative fixed rate shares are only entitled to vote on any resolution to vary or abrogate the rights attached to the fixed rate shares. Holders have one vote for every fully paid 7% cumulative fixed rate share.\n\n## Liquidation rights\n\nIn the event of the liquidation of the Company, after payment of all liabilities and deductions in accordance with English law, the holders of the Company's 7% cumulative fixed rate shares would be entitled to a sum equal to the capital paid up on such shares, together with certain dividend payments, in priority to holders of the Company's ordinary shares. The holders of the fixed rate shares do not have any other right to share in the Company\u0202s surplus assets.\n\n## Pre-emptive rights and new issues of shares\n\nUnder section 549 of the Companies Act 2006 Directors are, with certain exceptions, unable to allot the Company's ordinary shares or securities convertible into the Company's ordinary shares without the authority of the shareholders in a general meeting. In addition, section 561 of the Companies Act 2006 imposes further restrictions on the issue of equity securities (as defined in the Companies Act 2006 which includes the Company's ordinary shares and securities convertible into ordinary shares) that are, or are to be, paid up wholly in cash and not first offered to existing shareholders. The Company\u0202s Articles of Association allow shareholders to authorise Directors for a period specified in the relevant resolution to allot (i) relevant securities generally up to an amount fixed by the shareholders and (ii) equity securities for cash other than in connection with a pre-emptive offer up to an amount specified by the shareholders and free of the pre-emption restriction in section 561. At the 2023 AGM the amount of relevant securities fixed by shareholders under (i) above and the amount of equity securities specified by shareholders under (ii) above were in line with the Pre-Emption Group\u0202s Statement of Principles.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSee investors.vodafone.com/agm2024 for further details of such proposals provided in the 2024 Notice of AGM.\n\n## Disclosure of interests in the Company\u0202s shares\n\nThere are no provisions in the Articles of Association whereby persons acquiring, holding or disposing of a certain percentage of the Company's shares are required to make disclosure of their ownership percentage, although such requirements exist under the DTRs.\n\n## General meetings and notices\n\nSubject to the Articles of Association, AGMs are held at such times and places as determined by the Directors of the Company. The Directors may also, when they see fit, convene other general meetings of the Company. General meetings may also be convened on requisition as provided by the Companies Act 2006.\n\nAn AGM is required to be called on no less than 21 days' notice in writing.

The Directors may determine that persons entitled to receive notices of meetings are those persons entered on the register at the close of business on a day determined by the Directors, but no later than 21 days before the date the relevant notice is sent. The notice may also specify the record date, the time of which shall be determined in accordance with the Articles of Association and the Companies Act 2006.\n\nUnder section 336 of the Companies Act 2006, the AGM must be held each calendar year and within six months of the Company's year end.\n\n## Variation of rights\n\nIf at any time the Company's share capital is divided into different classes of shares, the rights attached to any class may be varied, subject to the provisions of the Companies Act 2006, either with the consent in writing of the holders of three quarters in nominal value of the shares of that class or at a separate meeting of the holders of the shares of that class.\n\nAt every such separate meeting all of the provisions of the Articles of Association relating to proceedings at a general meeting apply, except that (i) the quorum is to be the number of persons (which must be at least two) who hold or represent by proxy no less than one third in nominal value of the issued shares of the class, or if such quorum is not present at an adjourned meeting, one person who holds shares of the class regardless of the number of shares he holds; (ii) any person present in person or by proxy may demand a poll; and (iii) each shareholder will have one vote per share held in that particular class in the event a poll is taken. Class rights are deemed not to have been varied by the creation or issue of new shares ranking equally, with, or subsequent to that class of shares in sharing in profits or assets of the Company or by a redemption or repurchase of the shares by the Company.\n\n## Limitations on transfer, voting and shareholding\n\nAs far as the Company is aware there are no limitations imposed on the transfer, holding or voting of the Company's ordinary shares other than those limitations that would generally apply to all of the shareholders, which apply by law (e.g. due to insider dealing rules) or those that apply as a result of failure to comply with a notice under section 793 of the Companies Act 2006.\n\nNo shareholder has any securities carrying special rights with regard to control of the Company. The Company is not aware of any agreements between holders of securities that may result in restrictions on the transfer of securities.\n\n## Documents on display\n\nThe Company is subject to the information requirements of the US Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the \u0201Exchange Act\u0202) applicable to foreign private issuers. In accordance with these requirements, the Company files its Annual Report on Form 20-F and other related documents with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (the 'SEC'). These documents may be inspected at the SEC's public reference rooms located at 100 F Street, NE Washington, DC 20549.

These laws and such practice are subject to change, possibly on a retroactive basis.\n\nThis section is further based in part upon the representations of the depositary and assumes that each obligation in the deposit agreement and any related agreement will be performed in accordance with its terms.\n\nFor the purposes of the treaty and the US-UK double taxation convention relating to estate and gift taxes (the 'Estate Tax Convention'), and for US federal income tax and UK tax purposes, this section is based on the assumption that a holder of ADRs evidencing ADSs will generally be treated as the owner of the shares in the Company represented by those ADRs. Investors should note that a ruling by the first-tier tax tribunal in the UK has cast doubt on this view, but HMRC has stated that it will continue to apply its longstanding practice of regarding the holder of such ADRs as holding the beneficial interest in the underlying shares. Similarly, the US Treasury has expressed concern that US holders of depositary receipts (such as holders of ADRs representing our ADSs) may be claiming foreign tax credits in situations where an intermediary in the chain of ownership between such holders and the issuer of the security underlying the depositary receipts, or a party to whom depositary receipts or deposited shares are delivered by the depositary prior to the receipt by the depositary of the corresponding securities, has taken actions inconsistent with the ownership of the underlying security by the person claiming the credit, such as a disposition of such security. Such actions may also be inconsistent with the claiming of the reduced tax rates that may be applicable to certain dividends received by certain non-corporate holders, as described below. Accordingly, (i) the creditability of any UK taxes and (ii) the availability of the reduced tax rates for any dividends received by certain non-corporate US holders, each as described below, could be affected by actions taken by such parties or intermediaries. Generally exchanges of shares for ADRs and ADRs for shares will not be subject to US federal income tax or to UK tax other than stamp duty or stamp duty reserve tax.\n\n## Taxation of dividends\n\n## UK taxation\n\nUnder current UK law, there is no requirement to withhold tax from the dividends that we pay. Shareholders who are within the scope of UK corporation tax will be subject to corporation tax on the dividends we pay unless the dividends fall within an exempt class and certain other conditions are met. It is expected that the dividends we pay would generally be exempt.\n\nIndividual shareholders in the Company who are resident in the UK will be subject to income tax on the dividends we pay. Dividends will be taxable in the UK at the dividend rates applicable where the income received is above the dividend allowance (\u00a31,000 in this tax year, falling to \u00a3500 from 6 April 2024) which is taxed at a nil rate. Dividend income is treated as the highest part of an individual shareholder\u0202s income and the dividend allowance will count towards the basic or higher rate limits (as applicable), which may affect the rate of tax due on any dividend income in excess of the allowance.\n\n## US federal income taxation\n\nSubject to the passive foreign investment company ('PFIC') rules described below, a US holder is subject to US federal income taxation on the gross amount of any dividend we pay out of our current or accumulated earnings and profits (as determined for US federal income tax purposes). Distributions in excess of current and accumulated earnings and profits will be treated as a non-taxable return of capital to the extent of the US holder\u0202s basis in the shares or ADSs and thereafter as capital gain.\n\nHowever, the Company does not maintain calculations of its earnings and profits in accordance with US federal income tax accounting principles. US holders should, therefore, assume that any distribution by the Company with respect to shares will be reported as ordinary dividend income. Dividends paid to a non-corporate US holder will be taxable to the holder at the reduced rate normally applicable to long-term capital gains provided that certain requirements are met.\n\nDividends must be included in income when the US holder, in the case of shares, or the depositary, in the case of ADSs, actually or constructively receives the dividend and will not be eligible for the dividends-received deduction generally allowed to US corporations in respect of dividends received from other US corporations.\n\nThe amount of the dividend distribution to be included in income will be the US dollar value of the pound sterling or euro payments made determined at the spot pound sterling/US dollar rate or the spot euro/US dollar rate, as applicable, on the date the dividends are received by the US holder, in the case of shares, or the depositary, in the case of ADSs, regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted into US dollars at that time. If dividends received in pounds sterling or euros are converted into US dollars on the day they are received, the US holder generally will not be required to recognise any foreign currency gain or loss in respect of the dividend income.\n\nWhere UK tax is payable on any dividends received, a US holder may be entitled, subject to certain limitations, to a foreign tax credit in respect of such taxes.",

Holders who may fall within one of the above categories should consult their professional advisers.\n\n## US federal income taxation\n\nSubject to the PFIC rules described below, a US holder that sells or otherwise disposes of our shares or ADSs generally will recognise a capital gain or loss for US federal income tax purposes equal to the difference, if any, between the US dollar value of the amount realised and the holder's adjusted tax basis, determined in US dollars, in the shares or ADSs. This capital gain or loss will be a long-term capital gain or loss if the US holder's holding period in the shares or ADSs exceeds one year.\n\nThe gain or loss will generally be income or loss from sources within the US for foreign tax credit limitation purposes. The deductibility of losses is subject to limitations.\n\n## Additional tax considerations\n\n## UK inheritance tax\n\nAn individual who is domiciled in the United States (for the purposes of the Estate Tax Convention) and is not a UK national will not be subject to UK inheritance tax in respect of our shares or ADSs on the individual's death or on a transfer of the shares or ADSs during the individual's lifetime, provided that any applicable US federal gift or estate tax is paid, unless the shares or ADSs are part of the business property of a UK permanent establishment or pertain to a UK fixed base used for the performance of independent personal services. Where the shares or ADSs have been placed in trust by a settlor they may be subject to UK inheritance tax unless, when the trust was created, the settlor was domiciled in the United States and was not a UK national. Where the shares or ADSs are subject to both UK inheritance tax and to US federal gift or estate tax, the Estate Tax Convention generally provides a credit against US federal tax liabilities for UK inheritance tax paid. The above description does not take into account any change in law or practice that may arise from proposed changes announced by the UK government on 6 March 2024 to the taxation of non-UK domiciled individuals, and specific professional advice should be sought on this matter if relevant.\n\n## UK stamp duty and stamp duty reserve tax\n\nStamp duty will, subject to certain exceptions, be payable on any instrument transferring our shares to the custodian of the depositary at the rate of 1.5% on the amount or value of the consideration if on sale or on the value of such shares if not on sale. Stamp duty reserve tax ('SDRT'), at the rate of 1.5% of the amount or value of the\n\nconsideration or the value of the shares, could also be payable in these circumstances but no SDRT will be payable if stamp duty equal to such SDRT liability is paid. However, such transfers will not attract stamp duty or SDRT where they satisfy the conditions of an exemption, including exemptions which can apply to certain capital raising or qualifying listing arrangements. Specific professional advice should be sought before paying a 1.5% SDRT or stamp duty charge in any circumstances.\n\nNo stamp duty should, in practice, be required to be paid on any transfer of our ADSs provided that the ADSs and any separate instrument of transfer are executed and retained at all times outside the UK.\n\nA transfer of our shares in registered form will attract ad valorem stamp duty, generally at the rate of 0.5% of the purchase price of the shares. There is no charge to ad valorem stamp duty on gifts.\n\nSDRT is generally payable on an unconditional agreement to transfer our shares in registered form at 0.5% of the amount or value of the consideration for the transfer, but if, within six years of the date of the agreement, an instrument transferring the shares is executed and stamped, any SDRT that has been paid would be repayable or, if the SDRT has not been paid, the liability to pay the tax (but not necessarily interest and penalties) would be cancelled. However, an agreement to transfer our ADSs will not give rise to SDRT.\n\n## PFIC rules\n\nWe do not believe that our shares or ADSs will be stock of a PFIC for US federal income tax purposes for our current taxable year or the foreseeable future. This conclusion is a factual determination that is made annually and thus is subject to change. If we are a PFIC, US holders of shares would be required (i) to pay a special US addition to tax on certain distributions and (ii) any gain realised on the sale or other disposition of the shares or ADSs would in general not be treated as a capital gain unless a US holder elects to be taxed annually on a mark-to-market basis with respect to the shares or ADSs.\n\nOtherwise a US holder would be treated as if he or she has realised such gain and certain 'excess distributions' rateably over the holding period for the shares or ADSs and would be taxed at the highest tax rate in effect for each such year to which the gain was allocated. An interest charge in respect of the tax attributable to each such preceding year beginning with the first such year in which our shares or ADSs were treated as stock in a PFIC would also apply. In addition, dividends received from us would not be eligible for the reduced rate of tax described above under \u0201Taxation of dividends - US federal income taxation'.\n\n## Back-up withholding and information reporting\n\nPayments of dividends and other proceeds to a US holder with respect to shares or ADSs, by a US paying agent or other US intermediary, will be reported to the Internal Revenue Service and to the US holder as may be required under applicable regulations. Back-up withholding may apply to these payments if the US holder fails to provide an accurate taxpayer identification number or certification of exempt status or fails to comply with applicable certification requirements.\n\nCertain US holders are not subject to back-up withholding. US holders should consult their tax advisers about these rules and any other reporting obligations that may apply to the ownership or disposition of shares or ADSs, including requirements related to the holding of certain foreign financial assets.",

After various name changes, 20% of Racal Telecom Plc share capital was offered to the public in October 1988. The Company was fully demerged from Racal Electronics Plc and became an independent company in September 1991 at which time it changed its name to Vodafone Group Plc. Since then we have entered into various transactions which impacted the development of the Group. The most significant in the year ended 31 March 2024 are summarised below.\n\n- -On 29 March 2023, the Vodafone Group announced the initiation of procedures for a statutory merger and squeeze-out of minority shareholders in Kabel Deutschland Holding AG ('KDG'). This is procedure is now complete and Vodafone Group own 100% of KDG.\n- -On 14 June 2023 Vodafone Group and CK Hutchison Group Telecom Holdings Limited ('CKHGT'), a wholly owned subsidiary of CK Hutchison Holdings Limited, entered into binding agreements in relation to a combination of their UK telecommunication businesses, respectively Vodafone UK and Three UK (the 'Transaction'). Vodafone will own 51% of the combined business ('MergeCo') and CKHGT 49%. Vodafone UK will be contributed with \u00a34.3 billion and Three UK with \u00a31.7 billion, subject to customary completion adjustments. MergeCo's aggregate consolidated free cash flow will be distributed to the shareholders at least on an annual basis, subject to a target aggregate consolidated net financial debt of 2.5x MergeCo's 12 month rolling Adjusted EBITDAaL.\n- -On 18 July 2023 further to the announcement of a co-control partnership for Vantage Towers on 9 November 2022, Vodafone Group announced that, based on commitments secured by the consortium of long-term infrastructure investors led by Global Infrastructure Partners and KKR (together the 'Consortium'), Vodafone will receive further proceeds of \u20ac500 million, taking total net proceeds to \u20ac5.4 billion and the Consortium's ownership in Oak Holdings GmbH ('Oak Holdings') to 40%. Vodafone agreed with the Consortium a further 6 month window to acquire additional shares in Oak Holdings at the same price, up to a maximum of 50% ownership, by the end of 2023. Vodafone's 12 month option to pursue a sell-down to a 50% ownership stake in Oak Holdings outside of lock-up provisions and other restrictions will now commence on 1 January 2024.\n- -On 31 October 2023 Vodafone Group announced that it entered into a binding agreement with Zegona Communications plc ('Zegona') in relation to the sale of 100% of Vodafone Holdings Europe, S.L.U. ('Vodafone Spain') (the 'Transaction'). On completion, Vodafone's consideration will comprise at least \u20ac4.1 billion in cash and up to \u20ac0.9 billion in the form of Redeemable Preference Shares which redeem, for an amount comprising the subscription price and accrued preferential dividend, no later than 6 years after closing. Vodafone and Zegona have entered into an agreement whereby Vodafone will provide certain services to Vodafone Spain for a total annual service charge of c.\u20ac110 million.\n- -On 15 March 2024 Vodafone Group announced a binding agreement to sell 100% of its Italian operations ('Vodafone Italy') to Swisscom AG ('Swisscom') (the 'Transaction'). As part of the Transaction, Vodafone and Swisscom have agreed that Vodafone will continue to provide certain services (the 'Group Services') to Swisscom for up to 5 years. The annual charge for the Group Services to be paid by Swisscom to Vodafone for the first year after completion is estimated at approximately \u20ac350 million, of which approximately \u20ac176 million reflect charges currently reported below Vodafone Italy's segmental Adjusted EBITDAaL.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Regulation\n\n## Unaudited information\n\n## Introduction\n\nOur operating companies are generally subject to regulation governing their business activities. Such regulation typically takes the form of industry-specific law and regulation covering telecommunications services and general competition (anti-trust) law applicable to all activities. The following section describes the regulatory frameworks and the key regulatory developments at national and regional levels and in the European Union ('EU'), in which we had significant interests during the period ended 31 March 2024. Many of the regulatory developments reported in the following section involve ongoing proceedings or consideration of potential proceedings that have not reached a conclusion. Accordingly, we are unable to attach a specific level of financial risk to our performance from such matters.\n\n## EU\n\nIn November 2023, the EU adopted a regulation laying down harmonised rules on fair access to and fair use of data (the 'Data Act'). The Regulation applies to manufacturers of connected devices, data holders, recipients, and providers of data processing services (cloud service providers) who will be subject to new requirements to support switching and interoperability.\n\nThe Digital Markets Act ('DMA') was published in the official EU Journal in November 2022 and implementation and enforcement are underway. Providers of online platforms who pass the quantitative thresholds to be designated as 'gatekeepers' (annual turnover of \u20ac7.5 billion within the EU or a worldwide market valuation of \u20ac75 billion, plus 45 million monthly active end-users and 10,000 business users) will be subject to ex-ante regulatory obligations under the DMA. As of February 2024, six companies have been designated as digital gatekeepers across 20 Core Platform Services (CPS). The Digital Markets Act became fully enforceable on 7th March 2024, with the six companies designated as Digital Gatekeepers taking steps to comply with the regulation and evidencing this in the form of a report to be audited by the European Commission ('EC').\n\nThe European Commission has already launched investigations into three Gatekeepers for possible non-compliance with their obligations under the law: Apple, Google and Meta. The primary focus of these investigations is on conditions and charges for developers within the Apple and Google app stores, and in particular on the new Core Technology Fee that Apple has announced as part of its DMA compliance. The EC commits to conclude proceedings within 12 months. Companies will receive preliminary findings from the Commission that they can respond to and the opportunity to submit commitments. When the final decision is out, Gatekeepers will have two months to appeal to the EU courts.\n\nThe Digital Services Act ('DSA') was also published in the official EU Journal in November 2022. Online platforms, who have new obligations under the DSA, will be required to report their numbers of active users to the EC, to inform the designation of Very Large Online Platforms ('VLOPs') who will be subject to additional risk assessment and platform design obligations. As of August 2023, several companies have been designated as VLOPs and are now subject to regular auditing and regulatory requirements on platform design, risk assessment and mitigation. Smaller online platforms and other intermediaries became subject to new and updated rules on content moderation and due diligence from 17 February 2024.\n\nOn 24 April 2023, the EU-Ukraine Association Committee in Trade Configuration adopted a decision to apply EU Roam-Like-at-Home, intra-EU communication provisions and EU fixed termination rates (FTR) and mobile termination rates (MTR) between the EU and Ukraine. The time frame for transposition by Ukraine is one year after entry into force of this decision. The EC will then assess the transposition and in a further step grant internal market treatment",

On 6 October 2023, the EU-Moldova Association Committee in Trade Configuration adopted a decision to apply EU Roam-Like-at-Home, intra-EU communication provisions and EU fixed and mobile termination rates between the EU and Moldova. The time frame for transposition by Moldova is one year for intra-EU communications and two years for roaming and MTR/FTR after entry into force of this decision. The EC will then assess the transposition and in a further step grant internal market treatment before the provisions become applicable.\n\nOn 15 January 2024, the EC published a Staff Working Document on the findings of the 2023 review of the rules on EU-Roaming fair use policies. The Roaming Regulation (EU) 2022/612 requires the EC to periodically review the rules on (i) the application of fair use policy and (ii) the methodology for assessing the sustainability of the abolition of retail roaming surcharges. In its 2023 review, the EC concluded that the current safeguards are working and remain unchanged.\n\nOn 15 September 2022, the EC adopted its draft Cyber Resilience Act ('CRA'), introducing horizontal cybersecurity requirements for products with digital elements and associated services that are placed on the European single market. Products in scope will be subject to conformity assessment. Highly critical products will be subject to European cybersecurity certification schemes. The EC's draft CRA has entered the co-legislative process which is likely to be completed in Q2/2024 and apply 18 months to three years thereafter. In December 2023, negotiators finalised the text of the EU Artificial Intelligence Act ('AI Act'), the world's first comprehensive, horizontal regulation for AI systems. The final text confirms the risk-based approach, where AI systems surpassing a certain risk threshold are either prohibited outright, or subject to proportionate regulatory obligations. The final text also includes a compromise on General Purpose AI systems, whereby all providers of these foundational technologies are subject to some baseline regulatory requirements (transparency, record keeping and compliance with Copyright law) and systems that are deemed to be high impact (based on an evaluation of compute power) subject to additional risk mitigation rules.\n\nThe Gigabit Infrastructure Act ('GIA') (which revises the 2014 Broadband Cost Reduction Directive ('BCRD') is in its last stages before adoption. The GIA aims to reduce the cost of deploying gigabit electronic communication networks. While some of the proposed measures were watered down in the legislative process, welcomed proposals include the right to submit applications for all permits (or renewals) and rights of way in electronic format via a 'Single Information Point', permit fees not exceeding administrative costs, permit exemptions to civil engineering works, conditional tacit approval on permits and access to rooftops. The European Parliament proposed a ban on intra-EU communications retail surcharges which is unrelated to the GIA proposal, and this could have material impact on telecommunications operators. The legislators agreed to prolong the current caps until 1 January 2029. Abolition of surcharges from then onwards is conditional on (i) an EC review/impact assessment by 2027 and (ii) an EC implementing act on fair use provisions by 2028. Otherwise, the caps will expire in 2032. The GIA determines that telecommunications operators may voluntarily apply 'call-like-athome' charging from 1 Jan 2025 subject to fair use policy.\n\nThe EC & European Parliament adopted the GIA on 29 April 2024. This will replace the 2014 BCRD. The new law aims to simplify and accelerate the roll-out of high-speed networks, such as fibre and 5G, with a view to achieving Europe's connectivity objectives and targets set out in the digital compass for this decade.\n\nThe new regulation also aims to lower the unnecessarily high costs of the deployment of high-capacity networks partially caused by permit-granting procedures. The latter will be simplified through a\n\nStrategic report\n\nGovernance\n\nFinancials\n\nmandatory conciliation mechanism between public sector bodies and telecommunication operators. In addition, given that the present retail price cap for regulated intra-EU communications will expire on 14 May 2024, the current caps of 19 eurocents per minute for calls and 6 eurocents per SMS message are extended until 30 June 2032 to ensure protection, especially for vulnerable consumers.\n\nThe text will be published in the EU's Official Journal and enter into force before the end of May. The new law will apply 18 months after its entry into force with some specific provisions applying at a later stage.\n\nThe EC adopted a recommendation on the promotion of Gigabit Connectivity which seeks to provide guidance to National Regulatory Authorities on the conditions of access to the telecommunications networks of operators with significant market power 'SMP'. This instrument replaces the 2010 Next Generation Access Recommendation and the 2013 Non-discrimination and Costing Methodologies Recommendation. BEREC had adopted an opinion on the draft and had raised several issues, including the lack of alignment with the European Electronic Communications Code. It had specifically mentioned, for example, that there is a lack of sources or impact analysis clearly demonstrating that deregulating SMP Operators (e.g. removing remedies such as price regulation, allowing for an increase in copper access prices) speeds up very high capacity networks deployment/take-up. The EC took the BEREC Opinion into account, yet no substantial modifications were made. The EC also adopted, in February 2024, a digital connectivity package aimed at fostering innovation, security and resilience of digital infrastructures. The package includes two components; a white paper and a recommendation. The white paper entitled'How to master Europe's digital infrastructure needs?' analyses the challenges that Europe faces regarding the rollout of future connectivity networks, and presents possible scenarios to attract investments, foster innovation, increase security, and achieve a true Digital Single Market. The recommndationr elates to the security and resilience of submarine cable infrastructures, focusing on improving submarine cable security and resilience, through better EU coordination of governance and funding. A public consultation on the White Paper scenarios is on-going until 30 June 2024.\n\n## Country specific\n\n## Germany\n\nLicences for frequency allocations at 800MHz, parts of 1800MHz, and 2600MHz will expire at the end of 2025. Vodafone Germany currently holds allocations at 800MHz and 2600MHz. BNetzA is currently assessing its options on how to proceed on the reallocation of this spectrum. It may either re-auction the spectrum, or prolong the existing licences, or a combination of these. BNetzA is expected to make a final decision on next steps in Q2/2024.\n\nIn 2019, Vodafone acquired spectrum at 2.1GHz and 3.6GHz. The spectrum allocation includes coverage obligations which, depending on the specifics of the obligation, have to be fulfilled by end of either 2022 or 2024. All mobile network operators have reported on time on the status of obligation fulfilment for the 2022 obligations, including given judicial or factual circumstances hindering fulfilment. BNetzA has assessed the reports, including Vodafone's, and informed Vodafone about the results at the end of September 2023. Currently, BNetzA is conducting an official hearing with Vodafone on possible fines for a minor number of cases of non-fulfilment. BNetzA is expected to issue a final decision on potential fines after completion of the hearing in Q2/2024.",

Ofcom expects the changes to be introduced later in 2024. Ofcom believes the move to absolute value amounts will aid transparency and allow consumers to make more informed purchasing decisions.\n\nThe UK industry continues to work towards the introduction of a new One-Touch Switching process. The introduction of the industry wide process has been delayed, with some providers not ready. We have carried out the necessary work and are ready to participate whenever the process is launched (anticipated to be later in 2024). We continue to co-operate with industry partners and Ofcom over the future launch of the new process.\n\n## Vodacom: South Africa ('SA')\n\nThe NRA ('ICASA') has concluded a Review of the Pro-competitive Conditions imposed on relevant licensees in terms of the Call Termination Regulations and published its Findings document on 28 March 2022. ICASA gave notice on 26 May 2023 of its intention to proceed with the cost modelling phase with the aim to implement revised voice call termination rates. Information requests were issued to all Licensees after initial workshop held on 31 May 2023. During August 2023 ICASA finalised its consultation on costs standard and determined that pure long run incremental cost standard to be used. On 22 March 2024, ICASA published a draft amended to the Call Termination Regulations for comment. The rates proposed for mobile voice call termination, which are currently ZAR 9 cents for large operators, will reduce to 7 cents from 01 July 2024, and 4 cents from 01 July 2025. For small operators, the rates proposed, which are currently 13 cents, will reduce to 9 cents from 01 July 2024, and 4 cents from 01 July 2025. The rates proposed for fixed voice call termination, which are currently 6 cents, will reduce to 4 cents from 01 July 2024, and 1 cent from 01 July 2025.\n\nOn 23 June 2023, the Department of Communication and Digital Technology ('DCDT') published proposed amendments to the Electronic Communications Act ('Bill') for comment. Vodacom SA has submitted written comments on the Bill on 31 August 2023. The adoption of the Bill in its current format could lead to significant disruption of the local market, and specifically on Vodacom SA. The DCDT indicated that it will wait until the next Parliament has been elected (general election date 29 May 2024) before continuing with the process of amending the Electronic Communications Act.\n\nOn 29 February 2024, NRA published draft amendments to the End-user and Subscriber Service Charter ('EUSSC') Regulations 2016, relating to bundle usage sequencing & roll-over, and the transfer of bundles (or portions thereof) of voice minutes, SMS and data bundles, for comment. The deadline for written comments is 15 April 2024.\n\n## Other Europe: Ireland; Portugal; Romania; Greece; Czech Republic; Albania\n\n## Spectrum\n\nIn Portugal, Vodafone Portugal continues to appeal against certain aspects of the auction conditions for the 5G auction, which concluded in November 2021, claiming the conditions between new entrants and mobile network operators were discriminatory. Legal proceedings are still ongoing, with no expected date of conclusion, and the rights of use remain in place.\n\nIn Albania, the NRA (AKEP) started preliminary discussions with the operators on their interest in the 5G bands up for auction in November 2023 and published the official Public Consultation mid-January 2024 for the band 3.4GHz -3.8GHz only. The law frequency 700MHz is still being utilised by the media operators. The regulator expects comments and proposals on the document with regards to the quantity of spectrum to be auctioned, price for 1MHz, coverage\n\nobligations, size of blocks etc, by April 2024. Vodafone Albania has already submitted its comments to the NRA for the 3.4GHz -3.8GHz aiming to get usage rights for 100MHz of bandwitch allocation within this band.\n\nConcerns over electromagnetic field ('EMF') triggered a residents' petition in Greece for the annulment of the 5G Auction Tender document. Despite the auction process completing in December 2020 and the assigned spectrum already being in use by Vodafone Greece, the petition against the Tender document was heard in January 2022, and a decision by the Council of State is pending, estimated to conclude in 2024. In the case that the petition is accepted, the assignment of 5G spectrum rights will be declared invalid.\n\nIn July 2023, Greek NRA (EETT) informed mobile network operators ('MNO's) on the results of on-site audits which took place from October 2021 to March 2023 and indicated perceived breaches in Microwave links emission. In this context, EETT called \u039cNOs to submit their views. Vodafone Greece replied to NRA's letter and restored licensing status where relevant. Following this procedure, in January 2024, EETT called \u039cNOs to a Hearing via written memorandum. Vodafone Greece submitted its memorandum and additional supporting documentation on 19 February 2024. Decision is expected to conclude in 2024.\n\n## Universal Service Obligations (\u0201USO\u0202) and Consumer Support Measures\n\nVodafone Greece has four active appeals against the NRA ('EETT'). The appeals are in relation to charges amounting to around \u20ac16.75 million. Of this, \u20ac9.0 million is in relation to the provision of universal services by operator Hellenic Telecommunications Organisation (OTE) for the period of 2010 through to 2011. Vodafone Greece has appealed these costs, with the hearings due in April 2024 for 2010 and 2011. The remaining \u20ac7.75 million has been imposed on Vodafone Greece due to a decision of EETT on the universal service obligation USO net costs for the period of 2012 to 2016. Vodafone Greece also appealed these costs.\n\nThe appeal has been referred to the Administrative Court of Appeal, with the hearing due in November 2024. In addition, the Universal Service Net Cost Allocation Decision for the years 2017 to 2019 was issued in October 2023, with the Vodafone share (incl. CYTA) being calculated at \u20ac2.2 million. Vodafone Greece appealed these costs before the Administrative Court of Appeal in April 2024.\n\nSimilarly, Vodafone Portugal continues to challenge payment notices totalling \u20ac34.8 million issued by ANACOM regarding 2012 to 2014 extraordinary compensation of USO costs.\n\n## Access\n\nIn Czech Republic, in December 2023 Vodafone announced that it agreed with SAZKA a.s. to acquire the mobile virtual network operator (MVNO) SAZKAmobil. The transaction was cleared by the competition authority and was completed on 1 April 2024.\n\nIn Albania the NRA launched a Public Consultation on Mobile termination rates aiming to reduce National MTRs from 1.11 lek/ minute with a target to 0.75 lek/minute with a 2 year glidepath. The consultation has been finalised and NRA has issued the relevant decisions defining the glidepath for national MTRs. International MTRs remain deregulated.\n\n## Other Africa and Middle East: Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC); Tanzania; Mozambique; Lesotho; Turkey; Egypt.\n\n## Devices and registration\n\nIn Tanzania, the Communications Regulator ('TCRA') issued regulations that introduce a biometric registration requirement for SIMs and restrict the number of SIMs a customer may own. The TCRA",

    },
    {
        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\n## Regulation (continued)\n\n## Unaudited information\n\nrequired the disconnection of unverified SIMs in this category by 13 February 2023. The TCRA conducted inspections and subsequently following an inspection on 04 January 2024, the TCRA issued a compliance order against Vodacom Tanzania for failure to adhere to the regulations by allowing multiple SIM card registrations exceeding the allowed limits. Vodacom Tanzania made submissions to the TCRA and attended a hearing in this regard. The TCRA issued its final decision issuing a penalty of TZS 14 million (approx. \u20ac5,000).\n\nSimilarly, in Lesotho, the Minister of Communication introduced new SIM Registration regulations, which must be complied with by 24 June 2023. The regulations require the operator to enact biometric registration, establish a central database with the Communications Authority ('LCA'), re-register SIMs with a six-month timeframe and enforce penalties of Maloti 5,000 per non-compliant SIM card. On 1 February 2024, Vodacom Lesotho suspended all unregistered SIMs for 3 months (01 Feb- 30 April). Customers will be able to re-activate their numbers during the 90 days period, however, post 30 April 2024 all numbers not re-activated will be terminated.\n\n## Spectrum\n\nIn Mozambique, the 5G auction consultation proposes a reserve price of $15m per 2x5 of 700MHz, $15m per 2.6GHz and $15m per 3.5GHz. The price for 2.6GHz and 3.5GHz is comparatively excessive against both Vodafone and neighbouring markets benchmarks. The proposed draft auction rules are also against best practice. The Communications Regulator has indicated a willingness to introduce coverage obligations in exchange for marginally reduced pricing, but these are yet to be reflected in the official auction rules. The final\n\nauction rules are pending the approval of the cabinet of ministers.\n\nIn Egypt, the NRA ('NTRA') intends to initiate issuance of 5G radio frequency spectrum licences; the initial proposal included an indicative reserve price of US$450 million and successful bidders are expected to incur US$450 million in 5G-related network investment. Subsequently, the NTRA submitted a new proposal for the 5G license terms and conditions at a cost of US$150 million for 15 years with extension to all current licenses without spectrum. Vodafone Egypt did not accept this. On 1 January 2024, Vodafone Egypt received an offer from the NTRA for the 5G license entailing a license fee of USD 173m for a 15 year license terms and renewal of the 2G/3G/4G licenses until 2038. This offer was valid until 15 January 2024. The President had also directed that if the offer was not accepted by at least one of the operators, the NTRA will be required to issue new offer entailing USD 150m and renewal of existing licenses. On 15 January 2024, Vodafone Egypt rejected the offer, however, the government owned Telecom Egypt accepted the offer and announced its acquisition of a 5G license. On this basis, the government is trying to push operators to obtain the 5G license under similar terms and has currently closed off any possibility of further negotiations. For Vodafone Egypt, the proposal is not aligned with its business case.\n\nIn Turkey, the NRA issued a Board Decision regarding the Procedure and Principles on 2G license extension, fee, and obligations. Procedures and principles applied to Vodafone Turkey and Turkcell's licenses that expired on 27 April 2023 and TT Mobil's license that will expire in 2026. The extension fee for Vodafone Turkey (900 MHz) is \u20ac120 million for a six-year extension until 30 April 2029 (excluding 18% VAT). Vodafone Turkey paid the extension fee in advance with a capital injection and signed the extension agreement effective as of 27 April 2023. Therefore, the 2G license was extended until 30 April 2029.\n\n## Regulatory and legal disputes and fines\n\nIn the DRC, Vodacom DRC is in ongoing negotiations with the NRA ('ARPTC') in relation to new regulatory fees that were first introduced in March 2022. On 22 October 2022, the MNOs (including Vodacom DRC), Minister of Communications and ARPTC reached an agreement and signed a MoU on the new regulatory fees, setting out revised fees\n\nStrategic report\n\nGovernance\n\nFinancials\n\nand modality of payment. The MoU also provides for resolution of any pending fines and legal actions in this regard. Execution of each party's obligations under the MoU is ongoing.\n\nIn Tanzania, the TCRA found that Vodacom Tanzania had failed to comply with regulatory Quality of Service (QoS) targets in May 2023, mostly in the Zanzibar region, and has ordered Vodacom Tanzania to implement network improvements, with threat of fines if it fails to comply. Vodacom Tanzania completed implementation of five sites to address this matter in July 2023 and continues to ensure more improvement on optimisation is done to ensure coverage is maintained. Vodacom plans to roll out 30 additional sites in the Zanzibar in June 2024.\n\nIn Lesotho, the NRA ('LCA') has found Vodacom Lesotho in contravention of rule 6(a)(i) of the Quality of Service Rules, 2023 for the four hours network outages experienced on 16 June 2023. The LCA issued a fine of Maloti 1.0 million, but suspended execution of the fine for a period of 12 months, on condition that Vodacom Lesotho does not commit a similar contravention within that period. A recent network outage experienced in February 2024 by Vodacom was due to a fiber cut resulting from ongoing municipal construction work. Vodacom has reported the root cause of the outage to the LCA.\n\n## Networks and access\n\nIn Turkey, T\u00fcrk Telekom's reference offer regarding fibre access was approved by the NRA in June 2023, three years after the market analysis obligating fibre access. As expected, due to macroeconomic conditions, port and transmission prices have been increased by 70% effective as of 1 July 2023 within the offer, as well as an increase on the one-time fees. Vodafone Turkey continuously engages with relevant stakeholders and considers all remedies to ensure better access conditions are provided. We are also planning to conduct a workshop with BTK as a part of their continuing engagements to convey their key asks regarding fixed access competition, access and deployment issues. At the same time, Vodafone Turkey has taken the decision to court, and the legal proceedings are ongoing.\n\nIn Tanzania, the NRA ('TCRA') completed the market review study to update the Interconnection Rates Determination No.5/2017 to determine mobile termination rates that expired in December 2022. On 14 July 2023, the TCRA published a notice setting a new glidepath for MTRs for the next four years to 2027, to be applied retrospectively from 1 January 2023. The new glidepath is as follows: TZS 1.86 for 2023; TZS 1.76 for 2024; TZS 1.68 for 2025; TZS 1.60 for 2026; and TZS 1.52 for 2027. The glide-path represents an average decline of 5% per annum up to 2028.\n\nIn Egypt, Vodafone Egypt is in the process of shutting down 3G technology by end of 2026. The NRA ('NTRA') will define an industry 3G shutdown roadmap in line with Vodafone Egypt's own roadmap.",

Notes:\n\n- 1. All: Single (or unpaired) blocks of spectrum are used for asymmetric data (non-voice) use; block quantity has been rounded to the nearest whole number. Most of the radio spectrum in this table is organised as paired spectrum - a block of spectrum in a lower frequency band and an associated block of spectrum in an upper frequency band. Where the radio spectrum is specified in the form ' ' it represents 10 MHz in a lower band and 10 MHz in an upper band. Where this is followed by '+25', this idicates it is an unpaired, standalone, spectrum. 2x10 MHz\n- 2. Germany: The allocation of 2.1GHz will change to the following: At present we have 2x15 MHz (2040) and 2x5 (2025); in January 2026 will have 2x20 MHz (2040).\n- 3. Multiple : Blocks within the same spectrum band but with different licence expiry dates are separately identified\n- 4. UK: All UK spectrum licences are perpetual so any dates given are the ones from which licence fees become payable, and where no date is given this means that licence fees already apply.\n- 5. UK: Currently in the transition period of the 3.4-3.8 GHz defragmentation deal with VMO2. Once the transition is completed in 2025, Vodafone will have 90 MHz with an expiry date of 2038.\n- 6. Spain: The initial term of the licence is 20 years, with the option to renew the licence for an additional 20 years as long as the licence conditions have been met.\n- 7.

In particular, such forward looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements with respect to:\n\n- -the Group's portfolio transformation plan;\n- -expectations regarding the Group's financial condition or results of operations and the guidance for Adjusted EBITDAaL and Adjusted free cash flow for the financial year ending 31 March 2025;\n- -the announced agreement to combine Vodafone UK and Three UK; the announced agreements to dispose of Vodafone Spain and Vodafone Italy;\n- -changes to German TV laws and the migration of users to individual TV customer contracts; expectations for the Group's future performance generally; the transaction to purchase Nowo Communications; the Group's strategic partnership with Microsoft;\n- -climate change, including emissions targets and other ESG goals, commitments, targets and ambitions, climate-related scenarios or pathways and methodologies we use to assess our progress in relation to these;\n- -the digital transformation of the Group's business customers; the Group's partnership with DCC in the UK; expectations regarding the operating environment and market conditions and trends, including customer usage, competitive position and macroeconomic pressures, price trends and opportunities in specific geographic markets; intentions and expectations regarding the development, launch and expansion of products, services and technologies, either introduced by Vodafone or by Vodafone in conjunction with third parties or by third parties independently;\n- -expectations regarding the integration or performance of current and future investments, associates, joint ventures, non-controlled interests and newly acquired businesses;\n- -the impact of regulatory and legal proceedings involving the Group and of scheduled or potential regulatory changes; certain of the Group's plans and objectives, including the Group's strategy.\n\nForward-looking statements are sometimes but not always identified by their use of a date in the future or such words as \u0201will\u0202, \u0201may\u0202, \u0201expects\u0202, 'believes', 'intends', 'plans', 'further', 'ongoing', 'anticipates', 'could', or \u0201targets\u0202. By their nature, forward-looking statements are inherently predictive, speculative and involve risk and uncertainty because they relate to events and depend on circumstances that will occur in the future There are a number of factors that could cause actual results and developments to differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. These factors include, but are not limited to the following:\n\n- -general economic and political conditions in the jurisdictions in which the Group operates and changes to the associated legal, regulatory and tax environments; increased competition;\n- -levels of investment in network capacity and the Group's ability to deploy new technologies, products and services, including artificial intelligence;\n- -the Group's ability to optimise its portfolio in line with its business transformation plan;\n- -evolving cyber threats to the Group's services and confidential data;\n- -the Group's ability to embed responses to climate-related risks into business strategy and operations;\n- -rapid changes to existing products and services and the inability of new products and services to perform in accordance with expectations;\n- -the ability of the Group to integrate new technologies, products and services with existing networks, technologies, products and services;\n- -the Group's ability to generate and grow revenue; slower than expected impact of new or existing products, services or technologies on the Group's future revenue, cost structure and capital expenditure outlays; slower than expected customer growth,\n\nreduced customer retention, reductions or changes in customer spending and increased pricing pressure;\n\n- -the Group's ability to extend and expand its spectrum resources, to support ongoing growth in customer demand for mobile data services;\n- -the Group's ability to secure the timely delivery of high-quality products from suppliers; loss of suppliers, disruption of supply chains, shortages and greater than anticipated prices of new mobile handsets;\n- -changes in the costs to the Group of, or the rates the Group may charge for, terminations and roaming minutes;\n- -the impact of a failure or significant interruption to the Group's telecommunications, data centres, networks, IT systems or data protection systems;\n- -the Group's ability to realise expected benefits from acquisitions, partnerships, joint ventures, associates, franchises, brand licences, platform sharing or other arrangements with third parties, including the signed agreement to combine Vodafone's UK business with Three UK and the Group's strategic partnership with Microsoft;\n- -acquisitions and divestments of Group businesses and assets and the pursuit of new, unexpected strategic opportunities;\n- -the Group's ability to integrate acquired business or assets; the extent of any future write-downs or impairment charges on the Group's assets, or restructuring charges incurred as a result of an acquisition or disposition;\n- -developments in the Group's financial condition, earnings and distributable funds and other factors that the Board takes into account in determining the level of dividends;\n- -the Group's ability to satisfy working capital requirements;\n- -changes in foreign exchange rates;\n- -changes in the regulatory framework in which the Group operates;\n- -the impact of legal or other proceedings against the Group or other companies in the communications industry; and changes in statutory tax rates and profit mix, including the disposals of Vodafone Spain and Vodafone Italy;\n- -climate change projection risk including, for example, the evolution of climate change and its impacts, changes in the scientific assessment of climate change impacts, transition pathways and future risk exposure and limitations of climate scenario forecasts; amendments to or new ESG reporting standards, models or methodologies;\n- -changes in ESG data availability and quality which could result in revisions to reported data going forward; and climate scenarios and the models that analyse them have limitations that are sensitive to key assumptions and parameters, which are themselves subject to some uncertainty.\n\nA review of the reasons why actual results and developments may differ materially from the expectations disclosed or implied within forwardlooking statements can be found under 'Principal risk factors and uncertainties' on pages 57 to 62 of this document. All subsequent written or oral forward-looking statements attributable to Vodafone or any member of the Vodafone Group or any persons acting on their behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the factors referred to above. No assurances can be given that the forward-looking statements in this document will be realised. Subject to compliance with applicable law and regulations, Vodafone does not intend to update these forward-looking statements and does not undertake any obligation to do so.\n\nReferences in this document to information on websites, including other supporting disclosures located thereon such as videos, our ESG Addendum, our Climate Transition Plan and/or social media sites are included as an aid to their location and such information is not incorporated in, and does not form part of the 2024 Annual Report on Form 20-F.\n\nErnst & Young LLP has neither examined, compiled, nor performed any procedures with respect to the forward-looking statements. Accordingly, Ernst & Young LLP does not express an opinion or provide any other form of assurance on such information.",
