Exceptional  results  were  achieved  in  an  international environment marked by persistent geopolitical tensions and divisions, where Asian industry was able to gain traction in the electric vehicle market, while protectionist measures increased worldwide.\n\nI'd like to thank and congratulate Luca de Meo and his teams, the architects of  this  remarkable  performance.  My  gratitude  also  goes  to  the  Board  of Directors  for  its  work  of  listening,  analysing,  validating  and  supporting  the Group's strategic decisions.\n\nIn  addition  to  the  record  profits  posted  in  2023  and  the  successful launches -in  particular,  the  restyled  Clio  and  Captur,  the  hybrid  Jogger,  the New Espace, the electric Scenic and utility vehicles -the year was marked by the  implementation  of  an  innovative,  agile  organisation,  enabling  us  to specialise in each business to excel in it. The year 2023 was thus truly pivotal for  Renault  Group  between  confirming  the  recovery  and  building  the company  of  tomorrow.  And  I  can  only  be  delighted  to  see  employee shareholding increase from year to year, a further sign of confidence in the Group's strategy.\n\nAs  for  the  Alliance,  the  statements  made  by  its  managers  on  6  December 2023 materialised what we had announced a few months earlier: based on its historical  fundamentals  (60%  of  the  vehicles  of  the  three  partners  use common platforms),  the  Alliance  is  evolving,  as  it  has  done  throughout  its history. It works  on  several  levels  by  signing  agreements,  sharing technologies or seizing opportunities, such as the many projects we have in Europe,  India  or  South  America.  And  we're  delighted  that  Nissan  and Mitsubishi wish to become shareholders in Ampere, demonstrating the new dynamic of Alliance, which has regained its full strength.\n\nAfter this year of accomplishments, the biggest mistake would be to let our guard  down  in  2024.  The  road  to  the  electric  transition  in  Europe  won't  be easy, nor will our quest for value in all our international markets, in connection with our new organisation. The pressure will intensify, coming from both our competitors  and  the  major  powers  and  regional  blocs,  which  have  made support  for  their  automotive  industry  a  priority  by  allocating  considerable resources to it.\n\nThe coming years will be intense, but the way in which the company has been able to recover in such a short period of time can only inspire the greatest confidence.  In  2019,  the  challenge  was  to  ensure  the  Group's  sustainability and avoid the implosion of the Alliance. Four years later, Renault Group has once again become a model, and the Alliance has regained its balance and strength. What better encouragement to face the challenges ahead!\n\nAlongside the Board members, I'm determined to keep on working to ensure that the Group continues its journey to the forefront of sustainable mobility now that its impressive recovery has been confirmed.\n\nI",

It was time for us to close the chapter on a recovery at unprecedented speed in the recent annals of the automotive  industry.  Now  it's  been  done!  Just  three  years  after  suffering record  losses  of  \u20ac8  billion,  the  Group's  results  are  remarkable,  with  cash generation to match.\n\nBut we didn't wait for that to happen before going on the offensive. In late 2022,  we  announced  the  third  phase  of  Renaulution:  'Revolution'.  This  is indisputably one of the most sophisticated corporate reorganisation plans of the last 20 years, with the aim of transforming a Group with 125 years of experience into a next-generation automotive company, designed to find value  no  longer  where  it's  been  for  more  than  a  century  but  where  it'll be tomorrow.\n\nOur  philosophy  is  simple:  new  value  chains -electric,  software,  circular economy,  premium  and  new  forms  of  mobility -are  springing  up  on  the traditional value chain around the internal combustion engine. We're moving on from a single sport we've played for decades to multiple sports where only 100% dedicated athletes can aspire to the podium. That's why Renault Group is shaking up its roster to form five solid, quick-witted teams to cover each of the new sports: Ampere, Mobilize, Alpine, The Future Is NEUTRAL, and Horse.\n\nFor a year now, the implementation of this transformation has already been forging ahead at full speed. Horse started operating in July, and Ampere, our champion for electric and software, was launched in November. Ampere is unquestionably the European industry's most ambitious and comprehensive response to the challenges facing us from the West, but also from the East now because 2023 will undoubtedly be seen as the year when Europeans truly opened their eyes to the rise of the Chinese automotive industry.\n\nIn an increasingly demanding environment, the first two phases of the Ren aulution plan - Resurrection and Renovation - remain, more than ever, the essential driving force behind the Group's resilience and power to win n ew customers. A driving force we continue to fuel. On the Resurrection si de, for example, we've reduced the breakeven point by 50% since 2020. On the Renovation side, 2024 will be a critical year, with 10 launches, an a lltime record!\n\nReshaping Renault as a place where the automobile of tomorrow would be dreamed up was a pressing need. In a world where technological, regulatory, geopolitical,  and  price  volatilities  create  a  vicious  combination,  cultivating our  strategic  agility  and  innovativeness  at  every  level  of  the  company outweighs the race to achieve scale and efficiency, the traditional mantra of our industry.\n\nThe same priority has dictated the rebuilding of our Alliance with Nissan and Mitsubishi:  a  collaboration  that  now  gives  the  three  partners  full  room  for manoeuvre  while  focusing  attention  on  identifying  and  implementing business projects arising from the field.\n\nToday, there's no room for illusions. Between price wars, persistent economic and  geopolitical  instability,  and  a  deteriorated  market  environment  in Europe,  2024  will  be  anything  but  a  walk  in  the  park.  Now  is  the  time  to anticipate the course that the current tectonic movements will continue to take  in  the  coming  years  by  continuing  to  adapt  our  approach  to  the automotive value chain and, increasingly, adjacent playing fields. Is value on the move? We're going to follow it! In the midst of all this, one thing is certain: Renault  has  returned  to  the  forefront  of  manufacturers  that  have  the capacity today to create the automobile of tomorrow.\n\nI",

We  do  this  because mobility is a source of fulfilment and a freedom. We believe that  this  freedom  goes  hand  in  hand  with  preserving  the planet and living better together. So we are taking action to contribute to a better quality of life and limit our impact on the  climate  and  resources.  We,  too,  are  striving  to  make progress so that safe mobility is better shared.\n\n'A  company's Purpose is both its  roots  and  its  North  Star. The roots are what give a company depth and stability, and the  North  Star  is  the  desirable  future  towards  which  all energy is turned'.\n\nJean-Dominique Senard\n\nChairman of the Board of Directors of Renault S.A.\n\n## We are daring, embracing the future with optimism.\n\nWe  are  a  place  where  people  can  be  themselves,  playing their  part  in  a  shared  adventure.

The  ongoing  changes reshaping  the  automotive  industry  are  leading  to  the emergence  of  new  value  chains:  electric  vehicles  (EVs), software, new mobility services and the circular economy.\n\nTo  benefit  from  this  new  environment,  a  new  organisation has  been  implemented  gradually  from  2023,  enabling Renault Group to capture value across all new profit pools (estimated  by  external  sources  at  around  \u20ac220  billion  in 2030 compared with \u20ac110 billion today). To seize opportunities  in  these  markets  and  adapt  to  the  current environment, Renault Group has created dedicated organisations.  It  is  transforming  its  business  portfolio  by exploiting value chains that are structurally more profitable. Renault  Group  takes  advantage  of  a  horizontal  and ecosystem  approach  to  co-create,  co-finance  and  scale strategic initiatives with leading partners.",

Power: innovative low-emission combustion-engine and hybrid vehicles\n\nCombustion-engine and hybrid vehicles will still account for up to  50%  of  global  passenger  car  sales  even  by  2040.  The development of effective  technologies  in  this  area  is  essential for the future of any global carmaker. This is why Renault Group is  striving  to  develop  its  core  business,  with  the  launch  of  a brand-new  range  for  Renault  ICE  &  Hybrid  (passenger  cars), Dacia  and  LCV  -  and  with  the  creation  of  a  world-leading supplier of internal combustion and hybrid engine technologies.\n\nOn 1 July 2023, Horse was launched with the spin-off of Renault Group's powertrain activities .  Horse has  eight  manufacturing plants  for  engines  and  mechanical  transmissions  and  three research and development centres. Horse is headquartered in Madrid  (Spain)  and  operates  in  seven  countries  (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Portugal, Romania, Spain and Turkey).\n\nThis  entity  offers  a  complete  range  of  technologies  for  all components:  engine,  gearbox,  hybrid  system  (xHEV)  and batteries, at the best level.\n\n## Renault ICE & Hybrid: global product line expansion\n\nDespite the sharp increase in the supply of electric vehicles, internal combustion  vehicles will continue to grow, particularly outside Europe. The Renault brand will therefore remain present in the markets for internal combustion and hybrid  vehicles,  particularly  in  Latin  America,  India,  South Korea  and  North  Africa.  Sales  of  Renault  ICE  &  Hybrid passenger  cars  will  continue  to  grow  by  2%  per  year  on average over the period 2022-2030.\n\nTo  move  upmarket  in  all  regions,  Renault  is  continuing  its offensive in the C-segment, and between 2022 and 2030 will increase  net  income  by  20%  and  the  margin  on  variable costs by 30%.\n\n## Dacia: from more than 10% operating margin to 15% in 2030\n\nThe Dacia model is unique, based on a winning combination of three main components:\n\n- \u25cf engineering focused on design-to-cost already providing a solid double-digit cost advantage;\n- \u25cf an  industrial  and  supply  base  with  benchmark  cost competitiveness;\n- \u25cf an asset-light distribution model ensuring a level of cost comparable to the agency model;\n- \u25cf 85% retail sales mix.\n\nAs a result, Dacia already generates an operating margin of more than 10% and aims to reach 15% by 2030.\n\nTo  achieve  this  ambition,  Dacia,  currently  the  leader  in segment  B,  will  boldly  aim  for  segment  C.  After  Jogger  in 2022, Bigster will embody  this movement  towards segment  C  and  two  other  vehicles  will  follow,  which  will double the coverage of its profit pool.\n\nAt the same time, Dacia will continue to reduce its costs and will  benefit  from  the  doubling  of  volumes  of  the  global CMF-B  platform,  which  will  reach  (all  brands  combined) 2 million units by 2030.\n\nDacia  is  helping  to  reinvent  the  internal  combustion  value chain  thanks  to  its  cooperation  with  Horse  by  developing breakthrough  engines  suitable  for  alternative  and  synthetic fuels.  Dacia  will  gradually  electrify  its  range  in  Europe  by pioneering the deployment of accessible electrical solutions.\n\nI\n\n01",

Hyvia combines the hydrogen expertise of Plug Power with the industrial and  engineering  assets  of  Renault  Group.  Hyvia  is targeting  30%  of  the  hydrogen  LCV  market  in  2030  in Europe and a cumulative order book of \u20ac1 billion by 2026;\n- \u25cf FlexEVan: a  revolutionary  family  of  utility,  electric  and software-defined  vehicles,  which  will  be  launched  from 2026.  FlexEVan  will  be  compact  for  city  use  thanks  to  a specially designed electric platform. FlexEVan will benefit from  the SDV (Software-Defined  Vehicle)  developed within Ampere. The vehicle will become a fully connected warehouse  extension,  integrated  into  the  customer's digital ecosystem. It will be the first vehicle to benefit from the  application  of  Renault  Group's  SDV  technology, enabling  real-time  end-to-end  monitoring  of  operations and data-based fleet management. FlexEVan will reduce the  cost  of  ownership  over  the  total  lifetime  by  at  least 30% for  customers,  which  is  more  than  the  price  of  the vehicle.  To  bring  this  project  to  fruition,  which  is  a  game changer  for the mobility and  logistics sector, in October 2023 Renault Group announced the creation of a new joint venture with the Volvo group, in which they will each  initially  hold  a  50-50  stake,  investing  \u20ac300  million over the next three years.\n- 2. Ampere:  THE  EUROPEAN  CHALLENGER:  Technological excellence  and  an  operational  focus  to  help  bring electric vehicles into the mainstream\n\n## Ampere is at the heart of Renault Group's transformation.\n\nAmpere  is  a  pure  player  in  electric  vehicles  and  software, which develops, manufactures and markets electric passenger vehicles under the Renault brand for the European market.  It  was  successfully  created  on  1  November  2023.

Alpine:  an  exclusive,  zero-emission,  global  brand  with motor racing in its DNA\n\nOver  the  past  two  years,  Alpine  has  experienced  a renaissance, capitalising on its iconic A110 sports coup\u00e9 and its entry  into  Formula  1,  where  it  aims  to  become  a contender  for  the  championship.  Today,  Alpine  is  a  true exclusive brand, a manufacturer in its own right, asset-light, focused on technology, with a team of 2,000 people, 50% of whom are engineers. Being part of the Group gives Alpine access  to  Ampere's  electric  and  software  technology assets.  In  the  future,  Alpine  will  rely  on  commercial partnerships and investor support to accelerate its growth and international expansion.\n\nAlpine is developing a brand-new range that will support its growth and international ambitions and will be fully electric from 2026. In the meantime, Alpine will also unveil the next A110,  and  2  new  models:  a  B-segment  saloon  and  a C+ segment crossover. Alpine plans to launch two vehicles with state-of-the-art technologies in the D and E segments to support its international expansion. Thus, half of Alpine's growth  will  come  from  new  markets  beyond  Europe, potentially including North America and Asia.\n\nthe company,\n\nGeneral presentation of Renault Group\n\n| presentation of   | Sustainable   | Corporate   | Risk and   | Financial   | the capital and the   | Annual general   | Additional   |\n|-------------------|---------------|-------------|------------|-------------|-----------------------|------------------|--------------|\n| Renault Group     | development   | governance  | control    | statements  | share ownership       | meeting          | information  |\n\n## 4. Mobilize:  built  around  a  leading  financial  captive  to address  the  new  mobility,  energy  and  data  services market\n\nMobilize  is  built  around  a  key  asset,  Mobilize  Financial Services (Mobilize FS), one of the best financial captives on the market with 4 million customers. Mobilize FS is extending its traditional activities while developing new activities such as subscription, insurance and operational leasing.\n\nMobilize is on track to become a cost-effective and leading dedicated Vehicle-as-a-Service (VaaS) provider, combining financial,  mobility,  energy  and  data  services  supported  by specially designed  vehicles. These  services, grouped together in a single solution, will meet the needs of private customers,  fleets  and  mobility  operators  while  generating recurring  revenues.  What  makes  Mobilize  stand  out  from any other automotive brand is that it comes from services to the  product  and  not  the  other  way  around.  Thanks  to  the VaaS  model,  Mobilize  will  generate  three  times  more revenue  over  the  entire  vehicle  life  cycle,  compared  with traditional sales.\n\n## 5. The  Future  Is  NEUTRAL:  the  first  company  in  the automotive  industry  dedicated  to  the  360\u00b0  circular economy,  from  the  closed  loop  of  materials  to  battery recycling\n\nTo anchor its commitment to the circular economy and move forward  on  the  path  to  resource  neutrality,  Renault  Group has created a new  entity: The Future Is NEUTRAL. By  bringing  together  all  the  existing  expertise  of  the  Group and its partners in this activity, this new entity offers closedloop  recycling  solutions  at  every  stage  of  a  vehicle's  life: supply  of  parts  and  raw  materials,  production,  use  and end-of-life. The Future Is NEUTRAL  currently covers approximately 50% of the value chain and targets more than 90% by 2030. This entity is set to become the European leader in the  closed-loop  automotive  circular  economy,  on  an industrial  scale.  It  will  serve  Renault  Group  and  the  entire sector. In order to accelerate its development and strengthen its leadership, The Future Is NEUTRAL is opening up a minority of  its  capital  to  external  investors  with  the  objective  of  cofinancing investments of around \u20ac500 million until 2030.\n\n## ESG (Environment, Social, Governance): a performance driver for Renault Group\n\nThe  Group's  Revolution  will  see  an  acceleration  of  its  ESG trajectory,  representing  a  key  driver  for  the  Group's operational and financial performance.\n\nRe-engineering  Renault  Group's  business  will  enable  it  to become a forerunner in the quest for carbon neutrality and an inclusive future.\n\nIn terms of climate, the Group is aiming for carbon neutrality in  Europe  by  2040  and  worldwide  by  2050 ,  by  adopting  a cradle-to-grave approach. The Group  has  set itself intermediate carbon footprint reduction targets to mark its path, with specific action plans for each of its activities.\n\nI\n\n01",

focus  on  variable  costs,  the  development  of  a sustainable  supplier  network  and  digitisation.  In  addition,  a unique ecosystem partnership approach makes it possible to extend  the  coverage  of  key  value  chains  with  a  low  capital commitment bias.\n\nTo  meet  the  challenge  of  the  industry's  unprecedented transformation,  Renault  Group  has  adopted  an  approach based on two principles:\n\n- \u25cf a self-financed plan, secured by the strong generation of free cash flow from its operations;\n- \u25cf partnerships or external financing to accelerate growth, innovation or competitiveness and reduce capital requirements.",

This  dividend symbolises  a  new  era.  The  distribution  rate  will  increase gradually  and  in  a  disciplined  manner  up  to  35%  of  net income  -  Group  share,  in  the  medium  term  subject  to  the approval of the General Meeting of Shareholders. To do this, the  Group  will  need  to  achieve  its  first  priority,  which  is  to return to an investment grade financial rating.\n\n## Capital allocation policy\n\nRenault Group plans to reinvest at least 50% of the surplus cash  generated  within  the  Group.  In  the  future,  Renault\n\nGroup wishes to be more active on financial investments, in line  with its  ecosystem approach, but by limiting them to a maximum of 15% to 20% of its free cash flow.\n\nFor  the  allocation  of  the  remaining  cash,  apart  from  the dividend,  the  Group  wishes  to  involve  employees  in  its performance  to  promote  a  shared  sense  of  belonging  to the  project  and  foster  a  culture  of  value.  Through dedicated  employee  share  ownership  programmes,  the Group aims to increase employee share ownership to 10% of the capital by 2030.\n\nThe existing bonds remain under Renault S.A., which is the issuer  of  the  Group's  industrial  activities.  Each  business could use financing instruments depending on its own needs and strategy.\n\nI\n\n01",

Kardian will go on sale in spring 2024 in Latin America.\n\n## The brand strategy in both PC and LCV\n\nRenault  is  the  ingenious,  popular  and  modern  French automotive brand dedicated to sustainable mobility.\n\nRenault has constantly innovated to improve the mobility of all individuals and professionals. Bold in its offering, peopleoriented,  optimistic  and  full  of  life,  the  Renault  brand  is inventing  the  future  of  ever  more  'Tech'  mobility,  while staying truly human.\n\nSynonymous  with  progress,  Renault  cars  have  become icons over the years, like the Renault 4 or the Renault 5, cult vehicles of the 1970s and 1980s.\n\nInvolved in the challenges of its time, and after distinguishing  itself  as  a  pioneer  in  electric  vehicles,  the Renault  brand  is  committed  to  the  development  of  the electric  mobility  ecosystem. It  takes  a  holistic  approach  to product  recyclability,  from  the  design  stage  right  through the product's life cycle.\n\nToday,  Renault  also  continues  to  innovate  on  the  latest generation of the 'Car for life and for living' concept, for an ever  more  welcoming,  intuitively  intelligent  (Tech),  warm and safe experience.\n\n## Scenic E-Tech Electric Reveal\n\n## Rafale reveal at the Paris Air Show on 18 June 2023\n\nNew Renault Scenic E-Tech electric: the first 100% Electric family vehicle designed more sustainably. New Scenic will be on sale from the beginning of 2024.\n\nRenault Rafale, a top-of-therange SUV coup\u00e9, aims to promote the brand's image and win over new customers in the top-of-the-range market. Rafale will be marketed in the first quarter of 2024.\n\n## Reveal and launch of Espace\n\n## Master reveal\n\nRenault has unveiled and launched Espace, the new 5- or 7-seater MPV that marks the 6 th alment in the Espace saga, which began in 1983. The New Renault Espace was launched in spring 2023.\n\nLaunched from spring 2024, the New Renault Master is designed to go further, load more and spend less: the perfect new-generation multienergy Aerovan.\n\nIn  Europe,  the  Renault  brand  outperforms  in  C-segment. Renault's  C-segment  model  range  plays  an  increasingly important  role  in the brand's overall sales, posting considerable  growth  of  +24.7%  compared  with  2022  for  a total of 254,161 units sold in 2023.\n\nIn addition, Renault is maintaining its level of retail sales at an optimal level, with more than one vehicle in two sold to private  customers.  Retail  sales  reached  50.1%  for  the  full year 2023 in total for France + Germany + UK + Italy + Spain.\n\nIn  2023,  the  promotion  also  continues,  outside  Europe,  with the  expansion  of  the  marketing  of  Kwid  E-Tech  electric  in Latin  American markets, and the expansion of Taliant into new markets in the rest of the world. New Renault Kardian is, for its part, the first stone in the construction of the product offensive outside Europe of the 2027 range plan.\n\nAt  the  same  time,  the  Renault  brand  is  continuing  its development in Light Commercial Vehicles.\n\nIn  2023,  Renault  was  number  1  in  vans  in  Europe.  This leadership is built around each of the following vehicles:\n\n- \u25cf Express Van & Kangoo Van enable the Renault brand to be the European leader in the Small Van segment;\n- \u25cf Trafic  Van  is  on  the  European  podium  in  the  Light  Van segment;\n- \u25cf Master Van is number 1 in Heavy Vans.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## With Renault E-TECH, a pioneer and leader in the electric vehicle market, Renault is continuing its product offensive\n\nRenault,  a  pioneer  in  electric  vehicles,  is  one  of  the  major players in electric mobility in Europe.\n\nThanks  to  its  Formula  1  innovation  laboratory,  Renault  has developed  its  E-Tech  hybrid  powertrain,  protected  by 150 patents.\n\nRenault  E-Tech  covers  hybrid,  plug-in  hybrids,  and  100% electric vehicles.\n\nE-Tech  technology  is  offered  on  all  major  new  models  as soon as they are launched.\n\nAfter  the  M\u00e9gane,  it  is  Sc\u00e9nic's  turn  to  reinvent  itself  and become  the  spearhead  of  Renault's  new  generation  of electric vehicles.\n\nNew  M\u00e9gane  E-Tech  electric  and  New  Scenic  E-Tech electric embody  the  brand's  transformation,  with  a breakthrough both emotionally and technologically. Connected  and  integrated  into  the  electric  and  digital ecosystem  of  its  users,  they  allow  Renault  to  continue  its history of 'new-generation cars for life and for living'.\n\n## Models for 2023\n\n## Renault passenger cars (PC)\n\n## Renault passenger cars (PC) - EUROPE:\n\n## Renault, the offensive in segment C continues:\n\nThe  'C'  segment,  the  most  profitable  segment  on  the market,  is  still  at  the  heart  of  Renault's  strategic  plan. Arkana, which began the offensive in this segment, has been very  successful.  Renault  continued  the  offensive  with  New M\u00e9gane  E-Tech  electric,  followed  by  Renault  Austral, and finally New Scenic.\n\n## Austral:\n\nRenault is renewing its offering in the C-SUV category with a particularly ambitious product, combing the look of an SUV and  comfort  worthy  of  the  family  MPVs  that  have  helped shape the history of Renault. Its elegant design is spiced up by a 'Esprit Alpine' finish, a first for Renault. This finish offers special  design  aspects,  inspired  by  the  world  of  the  Alpine brand, particularly dynamic and attractive.\n\nFrom  a  technical  perspective,  Austral  is  the  first  Renault vehicle designed on the CMF-CD platform. It benefits from a fully  electric  engine  range,  including  two  mild-hybrid  units with  12v  or  48v  hybridisation,  and  a  new  generation  of  the E-Tech  Full  Hybrid  system,  developing  up  to  200  hp  with  a very  low  level  of  consumption  and  CO2  emissions  (from 101 g/km and 4.5 litres/100 km).\n\nAustral's  generous  passenger  compartment  space  also offers an enhanced driving experience thanks to high-tech equipment. The openR\u00ae HMI* brings together data from the instrument panel with the openRlink\u00ae multimedia system all within  the  same  unit.  Its  two  large  12 \" -diagonal  screens provide  an  unprecedented  and  technological  on-board\n\nthe company,\n\n| presentation of   | Sustainable   | Corporate   | Risk and   | Financial                  | the capital and the   | Annual general Additional   |\n|-------------------|---------------|-------------|------------|----------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------------|\n| Renault Group     | development   | governance  | control    | share ownership statements | meeting               | information                 |\n\n## General presentation of Renault Group\n\nexperience, complementing the head-up display system on the  windscreen.  The  openRlink\u00ae  multimedia  system  offers Google services. The 32 driving assistance features provide peace of mind and safety for all vehicle occupants.\n\nLastly,  quality  and  durability  have  been  at  the  heart  of Renault Austral's technical specifications, from its development to its production.\n\nAustral  completed  its  first  full  year  on  the  market  in  2023 with  85,459  worldwide sales, with more than half in top-ofthe-range finishes.\n\n*HMI = Human-Machine Interface\n\n## Scenic E-Tech Electric:\n\nScenic  E-Tech  Electric  was  just  named  2024  \"Car  of  the Year\" by the \"Car of the Year\" jury. It is the first 100% electric family vehicle designed more sustainably.\n\nScenic  reflects  the  Renault  brand's  ability  to  understand families, anticipate changes in society and innovate.  Today's  families  still  need  space  on  board, versatility  and  safety.  Concerned  with  the  future  of  the planet,  they  are  also  aware  of  the  need  to  reduce  their environmental  footprint  and  believe  that  technology  and connectivity  can  accelerate  this  transition.  To  meet  the needs  of  these  customers,  the  New  Scenic  has  been designed in 100% electric mode and focuses on versatility, comfort and technology.\n\nWith  its  exceptional  range  of  up  to  625  km  WLTP,  Scenic E-Tech's aim is to convince families to go electric and free them  from  all  constraints.  The  OpenR  Link  system,  which incorporates  Google  Maps,  makes  it  easy  to  plan  electric journeys, optimising overall journey times.\n\nScenic E-Tech boasts a reduced footprint for the category with a length of 4.47 m while offering its passengers record spaciousness  thanks  to  the  flat  floor,  but  also  for  luggage with a boot volume of 545 litres.\n\nThe innovative opacifying Solarbay glass roof and 'ingenious'  rear  armrest  complete  this  unique  on-board experience.\n\nIntroducing the Renault brand's new design identity with a new brand light and a spectacular grille, its sound signature is  also  unique,  thanks  to  an  exceptional  collaboration  with artist, composer and author Jean-Michel Jarre.\n\nLastly, the 100% electric Scenic E-Tech is the first vehicle in the Renault range designed in a sustainable way, with up to 24% of the mass of materials used coming from the circular economy, several of which come from closed loops. At the end of its life,  90% of the vehicle's mass can be recyclable through  industrial  channels,  in  accordance  with  Directive 2005/64/EC.\n\n## Megane E-Tech Electric:\n\nM\u00e9gane  E-Tech  100%  electric  is  the  first  model  to  be  100% \"made  in  ElectriCity\",  the  new  European  benchmark  for electric  vehicles,  set  up  by  Renault  Group  in  the  north  of France.\n\nThe  100%  electric  M\u00e9gane  E-Tech  had  its  first  full  year  of sales  in  2023,  totalling  47,186  vehicles  sold  worldwide  with more than two thirds of top-of-the-range finishes,\n\n01",

The conquest rate is over 50% (and even 60% in France), with a share of 10% coming from premium brand customers.\n\nM\u00e9gane  E-Tech  100%  electric  is  recognised  as  one  of  the most efficient electric vehicles in the European C-segment, winning  numerous  awards:  ' Electric  Car  of  the  Year', 'Driving  Electric  Technology  Awards'  and  a  5-star  rating from Euro NCAP.\n\n## Arkana:\n\nArkana confirmed its success in 2023, totalling 259,161 cars sold since its launch.\n\nFrom July 2023, New Arkana benefited from the brand's new visual identity with a change in its design to incorporate the new Renault 'Nouvel'R' logo. Like the most recent models in the Renault range, the New Arkana is now offered in a topof-the-range Esprit Alpine finish.\n\nIt  continues  to  expand  its  offering  internationally,  with  its launch  in  Morocco,  in  its  145  hp  E-Tech  Hybrid  version,  the first stage of the E-tech offensive in this country.\n\n## In the A segment\n\n## Twingo:\n\nTwingo  3  phase  2  sales  totalled  34,991  units  in  2023 worldwide, its third full year of sales. The main markets for electric  Twingo  (which  accounts  for  54%  of  Twingo  sales) are France and Germany, which together account for 75% of electric Twingo sales.\n\n## In the B segment\n\n## Zoe:\n\nCompetition  in  the  electric  vehicle  market  continued  to grow throughout 2023 with the arrival of many competitors.\n\nIn  this  heightened  competitive  environment,  and  after  a successful 11-year  career,  Zoe  is  honestly  ranked  twelfth  in the  AB  EV  segment  with  16,203  vehicles  sold  in  2023 worldwide and a good performance in France.\n\n## Clio:\n\nIn 2023, Clio ranked 6 th in  worldwide sales in the B-segment, with 295,325 vehicles sold.\n\nClio remains  the  best-selling model  in  France  with 111,741  registrations  in  2023  (+51.6%  vs  2022).  The  successful launch of the new Clio in April 2023 gave the vehicle a new lease  of  life  with,  in  particular,  the  flagship  Esprit  Alpine version  E-TECH  full  hybrid  145,  the  success  of  which  was significant in the first months of launch.\n\nIn  2023,  the  new  Clio  is  one  of  the  brand's  first  vehicles  to carry the new design language: DRL and new logo. Its new\n\nbumper  makes  the  vehicle  more  attractive  and  more modern with a touch of sportiness provided by the F1 blade. Its new design adds to the already recognised qualities of a well-equipped, versatile compact vehicle with a full range of efficient engines.\n\nThe  Esprit  Alpine  version  with  shale  grey  tone,  side  badge and  special  wheel  rims  is  sold  100%  in  hybrid  and  petrol versions. Inside, the dashboard is 100% digital and recycled materials have been introduced. The new rafale grey colour, also available, adds an extra touch of elegance.\n\nWith E-Tech hybrid, Clio ranked 2 nd in the European hybrid Bsegment in 2023. With more than 42,000 vehicles sold by the end of December, Clio therefore maintains its position in the hybrid market with a technology recognised for its simplicity of  use  and  its  advantages  in  terms  of  consumption  and driving pleasure.\n\n## Captur:\n\nSold  in  more  than  50  countries,  Captur  sales  totalled 158,891 units in 2023. In a competitive environment that is still very aggressive, with its wide range of engines and E-Tech as  its  spearhead,  Captur  remains  a  benchmark  player  in Europe with a 6.5% share of the B-segment SUV market.\n\n## Kangoo:\n\nKangoo,  produced  in  Maubeuge  (France),  was  renewed  in spring  2021.  Available  in  both  internal  combustion  (blue dCi 95 and TCe 130) and electric (90 kW electric motor for a range of up to 285 km WLTP) versions.\n\nKangoo is #2 in the Combispaces segment in Europe, thanks to its elegant and athletic design, a completely redesigned passenger compartment and numerous driving aids.\n\nFor 2023, Grand Kangoo has supplemented its offering with a  7-seater  version,  offering  the  best  versatility  in  the segment  and  available  in  both  internal  combustion  and 100% electric versions.\n\n## In the D and E segments\n\n## Full hybrid E-Tech Espace:\n\nRenault  has  unveiled  and  launched  New  Espace,  the  new 5-  or  7-seater  MPV  that  marks  the  6 th instalment  in  the Espace saga, which began in 1983.\n\nAs  a  forward  thinker,  Espace  has  always  moved  with  the times. Today, New Espace takes the look of an SUV with an athletic  and  elegant  design,  imbued  with  sportiness  in  the Esprit Alpine finish. True to its DNA as a 5- or 7-seater MPV, it remains  the  top-of-the-range  family  model  in  the  Renault range.  The  choice  of  refined  materials,  the  quality  of assembly and finish highlight a high-end, luminous interior thanks to the panoramic glass roof of more than one square metre, one of the largest on the market.",

It  looks  after  its  occupants  with  its connectivity  and  takes  care  of  its  environmental  footprint. More  compact  in  exterior  dimensions  and  215  kilos  lighter than  its  predecessor,  it  is  equipped  with  an  ultra-efficient 200 horsepower full hybrid E-Tech engine. Its low standard fuel consumption (4.6 litres/100 km) allows a range of up to 1,100 kilometres with a full tank, without recharging.\n\nFinally,  it  offers  4Control  (4-wheel  drive)  on  its  two  highest trim  levels,  for  remarkable  agility  and  manoeuvrability without compromising on comfort.\n\nLaunched in Europe in the second half of 2023, Espace sold 9,530 vehicles in 2023.\n\n## Rafale: E-Tech Full Hybrid 200 hp & E-Tech 4x4 300 hp\n\nFollowing  on  from  the  reconquest  of  the  C-segment,  the Renaulution  strategic  plan  is  now  initiating  a  reconquest of the D-segment with the New Espace and, under the sign of boldness and pleasure, with the New Rafale.\n\nNew Renault Rafale is an SUV coup\u00e9 with a dynamic, highstatus design that illustrates the new Renault brand design language  initiated  by  Gilles  Vidal.  With  its  quality  of execution and personality, it is the brand's new flagship.\n\nIt  uses  the  CMF-CD  modular  platform,  at  the  highest  level in  terms  of  performance  and  efficiency.  It  is  offered  with E-Tech  full  hybrid  200  hp  and  E-Tech  4x4  300  hp  plug-in hybrid powertrains.\n\nRenault Rafale aims to embody the values of innovation and sportiness  that  have  marked  the  history  of  the  Renault brand.  Innovation  is  embodied  in  design  and  technologies such  as  the  dramatic  opacifying  Solarbay  roof  with  voice control.  Sportiness  is  embodied  in  the  proportions,  in  the finishes and in the excellence of the engines and chassis.\n\nWhile offering an SUV coup\u00e9 design, Renault Rafale remains faithful  to  the  brand's  DNA  in  terms  of  life  on  board.

Sales of light commercial vehicles amounted to 391,853, representing  a  5.8%  global  market  share  (excluding  North America, China and Russia).\n\nIn Europe, the Renault brand is in the top 2 with 15.7% of the LCV market. Renault is also market leader, excluding pickups, in the four main Latin American markets.\n\nThe Renault LCV range offers vehicles from 3 to 22 m 3 ,  with petrol, diesel and electric vehicles. Renault is one of Europe's top three sellers of electric LCVs, with a 12,2% share of the LCV market.\n\n## Kangoo Van:\n\nThe  Kangoo  Van,  manufactured  at  the  Maubeuge  plant (France),  boasts  the  best  dimensions  in  its  category  with  a loading  volume  of  3.3  m 3 to  3.9  m 3 in  the  L1  version;  from 4.3  m 3 to  4.9  m 3 and  up  to  3.5  metres  of  effective  loading length  on  the  ground  (with  pivoting  mesh  partition  and folded passenger seat) for the L2 long-wheelbase version.\n\nBoth  internal  combustion  and  electric  versions  of  Kangoo Van feature a number of innovations to help our customers carry out a wide range of activities (the best side opening in the segment, 'Open Sesame by Renault' (1.45 m), retractable interior roof rack, etc.).\n\nKangoo  Van  E-Tech  offers  the  best  driving  range  in  the Small  Van  segment with a range of up to 300 km. Kangoo Van E-Tech is the leader in Europe with a 23,6% share of the electric Small Van segment.\n\n## New Trafic:\n\nNew Renault Trafic is a benchmark multipurpose van in the segment,  ever  more  comfortable  and  a  real  mobile  office, suited  to  the  multiple  expectations  and  uses  of  business customers. Trafic has record dimensions in effective length (4.15 m) and a volume ranging from 5.2 to 8.6 m 3 . It is available in  many  versions,  from  the  panel  van  to  the  platform  cab, both in an internal combustion version and, since the end of 2023, also in a 100% electric version.\n\nThe  New  Trafic  Van  E-Tech  makes  the  choice  of  zero compromise compared to the combustion engine version by offering a high level of performance,  diversity  and customisation.\n\nTrafic is  in  Europe's  top  3  in  the  Light  Van  segment  (with  a segment  share  of  16.7%).  It  is  manufactured  at  the Sandouville plant in France.\n\n## Master:\n\nMaster X62 is the leader in the European Large Van segment. It  offers  a  'made-to-measure'  offering:  a  wide  variety  of versions,  four  lengths,  three  heights,  van,  combi,  platform and  chassis  cab,  front-  and  rear-wheel  drive,  offering  a loading volume from 8 to 22 m 3 .\n\nMaster  is  manufactured  at  the  Batilly  plant  (France)  and Curitiba plant (Brazil).\n\nIn  2024,  Renault  will  launch  New  Master,  marked  by  its efficiency  thanks  to  its  'Aerovan'  aerodynamic  design  as well  as  its  new  dynamic  braking  system  and  optimisation work on the engines.\n\nNew Master will therefore consume 1.5 litres/100 km (internal combustion)  and  21  kWh/100  km  (electric)  less  than  the previous version of Master X62. This will give New Master a WLTP electric range of 410 km with an 87 kW battery.\n\nAs a multi-energy commercial vehicle (internal combustion, 100%  electric,  100%  connected...  and  much  more),  New Master will set the new standards in the Large Van segment.\n\n## Pick-ups:\n\nFor Renault, the pick-up market offers the opportunity to win new  customers  outside  Europe. Alaskan and Oroch form Renault's offensive. In Latin America, Alaskan is marketed in Argentina,  Colombia  and  Central  American  countries (importers).\n\nOroch was renewed in early 2022 and represents 24,157 sales in  2023. Oroch remains the leader of its segment or among the  top  performers  in  most  Latin  American  countries (number  1  in  Colombia,  number  3  in  Mexico,  number  3  in Argentina and number 5 in Brazil).",

Dacia  is  a  game  changer  offering  simple, multipurpose,  reliable  cars  in  tune  with  its  customers' lifestyles.  Dacia  models  became a reference on the market: Sandero, the best-selling car for European consumers; Duster, the  most  affordable  SUV;  Jogger,  the  5-  or  7-seater  family model;  and  Spring,  the  champion  of  accessible  electric mobility in Europe. Dacia is a brand of Renault Group, with a presence  in  44  countries.  Since  2004,  it  has  sold  more  than 8 million vehicles.\n\nIn  1999,  guided  by  Louis  Schweitzer,  Dacia  joined  Renault Group and opened up to new ambitions.\n\nThis  turning  point  in  the  brand's  history  came  in  2004  with the  launch  of  Logan,  a  modern,  robust  and,  above  all, affordable  family  sedan.  Initially  designed  for  emerging markets,  at  an  unbeatable  price  of  5,000  euros,  it  was  a great  commercial  success,  including  in  Western  Europe, where  it  went  on  sale  in  2005.  A  new  vehicle  at  a  secondhand price, it was a revolution in the car market.\n\n## Duster\n\n## Brand identity\n\nLaunch of the new Duster: In November 2023, Dacia presented the third generation of its iconic vehicle\n\n## Bigster\n\n## Dacia: sport\n\nBigster, Dacia's next SUV, to be manufactured at the Mioveni/ Pitesti plant (Romania)\n\nDacia announces its commitment in motorsport: in 2025, Dacia will open its rallyraid season with its participation in the Dakar Rally as a manufacturer in the T1+ category\n\n2008 saw the arrival of the Sandero, Dacia's second major launch under Renault Group. It also proved to be its biggest commercial  success.  Its  many  advantages -an  interior volume  worthy  of  a  higher  segment,  a  practical,  versatile spirit and an affordable price -have made it the top-selling car for individuals in Europe since 2017.\n\nIn 2010, Dacia launched the Duster, an attractive vehicle with true  off-road  capabilities.  It  was  once  again  a  commercial success, selling more than two million units worldwide.\n\nIn  November, Dacia also presented the third generation of Duster,  continuing  the  story  of  its  iconic  best-seller  with  a more robust and assertive design. It uses more sustainable materials and hybrid powertrains.\n\nThis  year  also  saw  the  announcement  of  the  brand's commitment to the Dakar Rally from 2025, alongside 10-time French rally  world  champion  S\u00e9bastien  Loeb,  Spanish  rally driver  Cristina  Guti\u00e9rrez  Herrero  and  Nasser  Al-Attiyah, winner of the last two Dakar Rallies. They will officially race for Dacia from 2024 during the test phases.\n\nLastly,  Dacia is launching its offensive in segment C and is developing  its  industrial  plan  to  support  the  rollout  of  its product plan with the allocation of a new vehicle based on Bigster Concept to the Mioveni plant (Romania) for a launch scheduled for 2025.\n\nI\n\nImplementation of the new brand identity: in 2023, all Dacia vehicles will be delivered with the new brand identity revealed in 2022\n\n01",

From design to  sales,  manufacturing  and  transport,  the  brand  remains faithful  to  its  strategy  of  optimising  costs  at  every  step  so that its customers pay only for what they need.\n\nDacia,  once  again  this  year,  continues  to  assert  its  three brand values:\n\n- \u25cf Both essential and cool at the same time Dacia is ingenious, creative and attractive, with innovations such as Media Control or modular roof bars. This is also true in terms of design, with a cool look... and at no extra cost;\n- \u25cf Robust and outdoor\n- Reliability  and  robustness  are  among  the  attributes  on which Dacia has built its success. These attributes make\n- Dacia cars ideal for outdoor activities;\n- \u25cf Eco-smart - economical and eco-friendly Dacia  is  committed  to  reconciling  the  interests  of individuals  with  those  of  society  as  a  whole.  Eliminating the superfluous thus reduces weight and thus saves fuel\n- and emits less CO2.\n\n## In 2023, Dacia enjoyed growing success in Europe\n\nUp Up 17.4% on the previous year, Dacia's worldwide sales volumes  will  reach  562,890  units  in  2023,  in  a  market  up (+  13.9%).  Dacia  has  maintained  its  market  share  of  4.3% (passenger cars).\n\nDacia's  growth  is  due  in  particular  to  the  success  of  its  new range  with  private  customers.  In  2023,  in  Europe,  Dacia achieved a record market share of 8.3% (+0.7 pt) in the private passenger  car  market,  ranking  2 nd in Europe  for  private customer sales, the heart of the brand's customer base.\n\nThis performance is based on the success of its four pillars: Sandero, Duster, Jogger and Spring.\n\n## Models for 2023\n\nSandero sold  269,899  units,  and  for  the  sixth  year  running, Dacia  Sandero  was  the  best-selling  model  to  private customers in Europe.\n\nDuster was on the podium for SUVs sold to individuals in 2023. With 200,633 units sold in all countries combined, Duster has exceeded 2.4 million units on the road since its launch in 2010.\n\nLaunched in spring 2022, Jogger sold 94,095 units in 2023 and is  the  number  1  vehicle  in  the  C-segment  (excluding  SUVs) sold to private customers in Europe.\n\nLaunched in 2021, Spring ,  Dacia's 100% electric vehicle, sold 61,803  units  by  2023,  up  26.4%  from  2022.  It  is  the  3 rd bestselling  electric  vehicle  to  private  individuals  in  Europe. Designed  for  greater  access  to  electric  cars  for  everyday travel,  Spring  is  becoming  a  city  car  leader  many  markets, and 80% of Spring buyers were not previously customers of the brand.\n\nLastly,  UP&GO,  which  enables  customers to benefit from a well-equipped vehicle delivered more quickly, is sold in more than 10 countries and available on four models (depending on the country): Duster, Jogger, Sandero and Logan. Since its launch in September 2021, UP&GO has been a great success with more than 138,000 customer deliveries.",

They  work  on  the  preparation  of  bids  and  the negotiation  of  contracts.  The  HBO  provides  the  interface with  all  Renault  functions  with  Horse  and  enables  optimal responsiveness  with  the  Renault  and  Horse  engineering departments. In order to ensure that cases are monitored on 23 - 24, the HBO handles relations with the partner OEMs.\n\n## 1.3.1.6 Renault Group Sales Network\n\n## 1.3.1.6.1 Organisation of the distribution networks\n\nRenault  Group  distributes  the  vehicles  under  its  brands through  brand  networks,  comprising  a  primary  and secondary network.\n\nThe primary network includes companies that are independent  of  Renault  Group  and  establishments  owned by Renault Group through its subsidiary Renault Retail Group (RRG). These companies and establishments are contractually bound to Renault Group through a distribution contract (or importer contract depending on the country).\n\nThe  secondary  network  includes  companies  independent of  Renault  Group,  contractually  bound  to  the  primary network, most often through a service agent or authorised repair  centre  contract.  The  purpose  of  the  secondary network  is  to  supplement  the  territorial  coverage  of  the primary  network  to  offer  the  best  service  quality  to  all Renault Group brand customers.\n\nthe company,\n\nthe capital and the\n\nshare ownership\n\n## General presentation of Renault Group\n\nIn early 2024, a new distribution contract will enter into force for  the  Renault  and  Dacia  brands  in  most  European countries.  This  partnership  agreement,  drawn  up  in  close collaboration with the Renault Europe dealer group (GCRE), reaffirms  Renault  Group's  strong  commitment  to  dealer distribution. Renault Group has thus confirmed its ambition to ensure  sustainable  and  profitable  growth  for  the Manufacturer  and  for  its  network  by  relying  on  strong independent  players  who  promote  the  image  of  Renault Group's brands.\n\nIn  2024,  Renault  Group  will  continue  to  update  the  visual identities  of  the  dealerships  so  that  each  showroom perfectly  reflects  the  universe,  spirit  and  identity  of  each brand. The presence of the renew label (used vehicles) will also be stepped up at points of sale.\n\nTo support the acceleration of electric vehicle sales, Renault has a complete E-Tech range for both private and business customers. The entire Renault Group distribution network is equipped  with  electric  charging  solutions  enabling  our customers to drive with complete peace of mind and is also committed to developing modern fast charging infrastructures,  both  in  dealerships  and  in  high-potential areas. Renault Group also relies on its distribution network to market  new  mobility  and  energy  services  through  the Mobilize brand.\n\nTo ensure the highest level of customer satisfaction, Renault Group  ensures  that  its  methods,  processes  and  skills  are kept  up  to  date  by  training  its  networks  in  both  Sales  and After-Sales,  in  particular  through  its  own  training  centre: Renault Academy.\n\n## Renault Pro+: the expert network of commercial vehicles for Professionals\n\nThe Renault Pro+ network serves and supports professionals in more than 20 countries. The Pro+ network, entirely  dedicated  to  professionals,  has  a  wide  range  of vehicles,  from  traditional  light  commercial  vehicles  to converted and customized vehicles. This network relies on expert  sales  teams  to  propose  the  solution  best  suited  to customers' needs and on an after-sales offering focused on the needs and challenges of professionals.\n\nNearly  600  Renault  Pro+  centres  make  up  this  specialised network, which applies specific service standards that meet the requirements of business customers.\n\nI\n\n01",

The  savings  bank  business,  a  pillar  of  corporate refinancing\n\nLaunched in 2012, the savings collection business operates in seven markets: France, Germany,  Austria, United Kingdom, Brazil, Spain and the Netherlands. Deposit taking is a means of diversifying the sources of refinancing for the Group's activity.\n\nThe  amounts  collected  amounted  to  \u20ac28.2  billion,  or approximately 51.5% of net 3 assets at end-December 2023.\n\n## 3. Nearly 4,000 employees are fully committed to creating sustainable mobility for all\n\nMobilize Financial Services focuses on three key priorities:\n\n## \u25cf Developing car leasing and subscription offers\n\nMobilize Financial Services expects to benefit from the growth in  the  operational  leasing  market  and  intends  to  deploy subscription  offers  based  on  the  skills  of  Bipi,  a  company acquired in 2021. Mobilize Lease&Co, a subsidiary specialising in  operational  leasing  for  all  types  of  customers,  individuals, companies and mobility operators, announced the acquisition of  MeinAuto.  A  leading  player  in  the  German  automotive leasing market, this transaction will accelerate the growth and development of operation leasing offers in Germany.\n\n## \u25cf Developing  the  used  vehicle  segment  by  optimising  its financing over the entire life cycle\n\nMobilize  Financial  Services  will  accelerate  its  used  vehicle finance  business  by  focusing  on  the  entire  life  cycle  and offering  an  integrated  journey  including  maintenance, recycling and remarketing.\n\n## \u25cf Offering  game-changing  services  around  car  insurance and payments\n\nTo  support  the  move  from  ownership  to  use,  Mobilize Financial Services has begun to expand its range of services around  innovative  auto  insurance,  leveraging  vehicle connectivity  to  offer  usage-based  products.  In  order  to achieve  all  these  objectives,  Mobilize  Financial  Services  is developing  new,  more  cross-cutting  working  methods based on collective intelligence. Drawing on nearly 100 years of automotive financing expertise, we want to develop used vehicle  financing  as  well  as  subscription  and  operational leasing  offerings.  These  will  ultimately  enable  us  to  have used  vehicles  that  will  facilitate  the  development  of  our financing  and  underwriting  activity  in  this  segment.  In  this context, exposure to residual value risk will increase.\n\n## Business Activity 4\n\nThe amount of new financing provided by Mobilize Financial Services  rose  by  17.1%  compared  with  2022  thanks  to  an increase in the average amount financed and in the number of Renault Group, Nissan and Mitsubishi registrations.\n\nIn  an  automotive  market  up    12.8% 5 , the  Renault  Group, Nissan and Mitsubishi volumes totalled 2.17 million vehicles, up  14%.  The  intervention  rate  was  43.4%,  down  1.4  points compared  with  2022.  The  intervention  rate  for  electric vehicles  was  48.1%  in  2023,  +5.2  pts  compared  with  the intervention rate for other types of engines.\n\nMobilize  Financial  Services  financed  1,274,199  projects  in 2023,  up  6.6%  compared  with  2022.  The  Used  Vehicle Financing  activity  fell  by  3.3%  compared  with  2022,  with 330,352 deals financed.\n\n82,272  new  electric  vehicles  were  financed  in  2023,  an increase of 2,607 units compared with 2022.\n\nNew  financing  (excluding  cards  and  personal  loans)  totalled \u20ac21 billion,  a  17.1%  increase,  which is explained by the growth in registrations  and  the  9.9%  increase  in  average  amounts financed (associated with the increase in vehicle selling prices).\n\nAverage  earning  assets  (AEA) 6 linked  to  the  Customers business amounted to \u20ac40.7 billion in 2023. They increased by 6.3%, driven by growth in new financing.\n\nThe  end  of  the  semiconductor  shortage  is  leading  to  a normalisation of vehicle inventories at dealers. As a result, average  earning  assets  related  to  the  Network  activity increased  by  \u20ac4.05  billion  to  \u20ac10.5  billion.  Overall,  average earning  assets  stood  at  \u20ac51.2  billion,  an  increase  of  14.4% compared with 2022.\n\nMobilize  Financial  Services  sold  3.9  service  and  insurance contracts in 2023, up 1.5% compared with 2022.\n\nThe  Europe  region  remains  the  core  business  of  Mobilize Financial Services, with new financing (excluding Cards and Personal  Loans)  amounting  to  \u20ac19.3  billion,  up  22% compared with  2022  and  representing  92%  of  the  Group's new financing.\n\nFor the Americas region, new financing totalled \u20ac1.3 billion, down  6%  compared  with  2022,  due  to  a  29%  fall  in  the Colombian  automotive  market  compared  with  2022  and  a negative impact of exchange rate fluctuations in Argentina.\n\nNew  financing  in  the  Africa-Middle  East-India  and  Pacific region totalled \u20ac0.4 billion, down 42% compared with 2022. This decrease is mainly due to Renault Group registrations in Korea, down 58% compared with 2022.\n\n- 3 Net assets at year-end: Total net outstandings at year-end + Operational leasing operations net of depreciation, amortisation and provisions.\n- 4 Excluding equity-accounted companies. A pro forma was carried out on 2021 sales data.\n- 5 Within the Mobilize Financial Services scope of activities.\n- 6 Average earning assets (AEA): average earning outstanding loans and financial leases plus assets related to operating leases.",

This decrease was mainly due to the  impact  of  interest  rate  swaps  used  to  hedge  demand deposits,  which  are  recognised  at  market  value.  These interest rate swaps had a negative impact of -\u20ac84 million in 2023  and  a  positive  impact  of  +\u20ac101  million  in  2022,  for  a variance  of -\u20ac185  million.

They  represent  1.39%  of AEA, an improvement of 3 basis points compared with 2022.\n\nThe total  cost  of  risk  was  0.30%  of  AEA  in  2023  compared with 0.44% in 2022. The cost of customer risk was 0.38% of customer AEA in 2023 compared with 0.55% in 2022.\n\nProfit before tax therefore came to \u20ac1,034 million compared with  \u20ac1,025  million  in  2022.  Income  from  associates  was a loss of \u20ac12 million 7 ,  compared with a loss of \u20ac127 million in 2022  due  to  an  impairment  of  \u20ac119  million  on  the  equity interest  in  the  JV  in  Russia.  Consolidated  net  profit attributable to shareholders in the parent company reached \u20ac787 million in 2023 compared with \u20ac684 million in 2022.\n\n## Results\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Balance sheet\n\nAssets rose in 2023 because of the growth in new financing and the normalisation of network outstanding loans, which had  bottomed  in  2022  because  of  the  semiconductor shortage.  At  the  end  of  2023,  ending  net  assets  reached \u20ac54.7  billion  compared  with  \u20ac49.5  billion,  up  10%  from  the previous year. Consolidated shareholders' equity amounted to  \u20ac6,500  million  compared  with  \u20ac6,461  million  at  endDecember 2022 (+0.6%), after IFRS 17 restatement.\n\nFrom 1 January 2023, IFRS 17 applies to insurance contracts issued  by  insurance  subsidiaries  of  Mobilize  FS.  Contracts will  now  be  valued  using  the  general  model  (known  as  the building blocks approach)  comprising:  (1) discounted probability-weighted future cash flow estimates, (2) a nonfinancial  risk  adjustment  and  (3)  the  contractual  service margin. The contractual service margin will be recognised in the  statement  of  income  based  on  the  units  of  cover provided  over  the  period.    The  financial  statements  have been restated to reflect the application of this standard. The impact of the first-time application of IFRS 17 on\n\nshareholders' equity at the beginning  of  2022  was +\u20ac167 million.\n\nThe results of the insurance activities are presented in the Mobilize  Financial  Services  group's  statement  of  income. The  restatements  represented  a  net  income  impact  of  \u20ac16 million in 2022.\n\n## Solvency\n\nThe overall solvency ratio was 16.05% (including CET1 ratio of 13.88%) at the end of 2023, compared with 16.84% (including CET1 ratio of 14.47%) at the end of December 2022. The fall in the  overall  ratio  is  explained  by  the  increase  in  REA (+\u20ac3,322  million)  largely  due  to  the  increase  in  credit exposures  in  the  corporate  (+\u20ac1,447  million)  and  retail customer (+\u20ac1,128 million) segments as well as the application of  IFRS  17  to  insurance  companies  (+\u20ac377  million).  This increase  in  REA  was  partially  offset  by  an  increase  in  CET1 capital (+\u20ac246 million) related to the integration of the annual profit  deducted  from  the  projected  dividend  (+\u20ac187  million), the application of IFRS 17 (+\u20ac151 million) and the increase in EL/ PROV differences (\u20ac70 million).\n\nI\n\n01",

In the second  half  of  2023,  in  response  to  falling  inflation  and resilient  economies, the central banks ended the rate hike cycle. At the end of 2023, the monetary policy cycle entered a new phase with the decline in recession risk and the rise in geopolitical and fiscal risks.\n\nIn  the  United  States,  given  the  persistence  of  inflationary pressures and the solidity of the labour market, interest rate hikes  continued  until  July  after  having  paused  in  June (+100 bps since December 2022, +525 bps since January 2022).\n\nIn  the  middle  of  the  first  half  of  the  year,  the  financial markets went through a phase of volatility and risk aversion. After a period of rising rates, some banks, which held large bond  portfolios  with  unrealised  losses,  had  a  weakened balance sheet. The US authorities have put in place rescue measures  to  protect  depositors  from  these  institutions.  At the  end  of  May,  improved  economic  statistics  (falling inflation and producer prices and less tension in the labour market) led the Fed to leave its key rates unchanged at its June meeting.\n\nThe second half of the year was marked by an acceleration in  US  economic  growth  (+4.9%  GDP  in  Q3,  +2.9%  year  on year) and awareness  of the scale of the federal government's  deficits  (new  crisis  on  the  debt  ceiling  and downgrading  of  the  country's  credit  rating).  Between  July and October, the rise in long-term rates prompted the Fed to leave its key rates unchanged, believing that they produced effects  equivalent  to  monetary  tightening.  The  strength  of the US economy was confirmed by the data published at the end  of  the  year,  enabling  the  Fed  to  confirm  that  it  would stop  raising  rates  at  its  December  meeting.  Inflationary pressures eased (3.1% in November), while the labour market normalised. Unemployment increased to 3.9% in November, compared with  3.6%  at  the  end  of  June  and  on  an  annual average  basis.  Job  creation  fell  significantly  to  150k  in  Q3, compared  with  an  average  of  240k  in  2023.  The  markets reacted strongly to this new monetary policy stance. At the end of December, they expected a 150 bps cut over the next 12 months and an initial cut in March 2024.\n\nIn  Europe,  the  ECB  raised  its  key  interest  rates  at  each meeting of the governors from February to September 2023 (+200  bps  between  December  2022  and  September  2023, +450 bps since the start of the tightening cycle initiated in July  2022)  and  reduced  its  balance  sheet  from  early March 2023 as announced in December 2022. The portfolio of the 'APP' asset purchase programme was thus reduced by  an  average  of  \u20ac15  billion  per  month.  Like  in  the  United States,  the  European  markets  experienced  significant volatility in the middle of the half-year.\n\nThe search for a balance between price stability and financial stability  has  been  the  ECB's  priority  in  its  monetary  policy decisions.  From  September,  the  ECB  indicated  that  it  would prefer to keep interest rates high for a long time to continue to fight  inflation  and  reduce  economic  risks.  The  economic indicators for the second half of the year were mixed. Inflation appeared to be under control and was down sharply (+2.4% in November, +5.5% in June vs +8.6% in January), but the economy\n\nshowed  showing  signs  of  weakness  (GDP:  +0.1%  at  endSeptember vs +1.8% at end-2022).\n\nAt the end of December, the markets were expecting rates to remain unchanged until Q2 2024 and fall by 160 bps by the end of 2024.\n\nThe  Bank  of  England  (BoE),  one  of  the  first  central  banks to begin the monetary tightening cycle, raised its key rate by 175  bps  between  January  and  August  2023,  bringing  it  to 5.25%,  for  a  total  increase  of  515  bps  since  the  start  of  the monetary  tightening  cycle  in  December  2021.  Inflation, which had been high since the start of  the  year,  improved sharply towards the end of the year (3.9% in November and 8.9%  in  September  versus  13.4%  in  January).  The  UK economy  remained  precarious  (GDP  down  0.1%  in  Q3, private  consumption down 0.4%). At the end of December, the market  was  expecting  current  rates  to  remain unchanged  until  the  second  half  of  2024  and  to  fall  by 150 bps over one year.\n\nAfter suffering a spread in short-term rates in the first half of the  year,  sovereign  yields  on  long  maturities  diverged sharply in October before returning to their early September levels  at  the  end  of  the  year.  Yields  on  German  two-year bonds  rose  by  51  bps  in  the  first  half  of  the  year  and  fell by 28 bps since the beginning of the year (2.39% at the end of 2023  versus  2.67%  at  the  beginning  of  2023).  At  the  same time, the yield on German 10-year government bonds stood at 2.02% at the end of December 2023 after peaking at 3% in mid-October  (2.39%  at  the  end  of  June  and  2.44%  at  the beginning of 2023). US bond yields have risen by 53 bps for the  two-year  and  14  bps  for  the  10-year  since  December 2023,  reaching  4.25%  and  3.88%  respectively  at  the  end of  December  2023  (compared  with  4.38%  and  3.7%  at  the start of 2023).\n\nDespite  a  few  periods  of  major  corrections  (March  and October 2023), equity markets continued the recovery that began in  the  fourth  quarter  of  2022.  The  Eurostoxx  50  and the  S&P  500  have  gained  respectively  +19%  and  +24.2% since the beginning of the year. After a period of volatility in the  middle  of  the  half-year  period  during  which  the  IBOXX Corporate Bond Euro index reached a high of 115.6 bps, the index stood at 91 bps at the end of December 2023, a level very close to the end-2022 level. Against this backdrop, the Group  issued  the  equivalent  of  \u20ac3.9  billion  on  the  bond market in 2023, and Moody's raised its credit rating by one notch in August. In particular, it  launched  its  second  green bond issue for \u20ac750 million. The success of this transaction demonstrates that the Group's ESG strategy is appreciated by  the  market  and  confirms  Mobilize  FS's  commitment  to the  fight  against  climate  change.  The  Group  also  issued 200  million  Swiss  francs  at  5  years  and  five  tranches  of \u20ac750 million at 3, 3 1/2, 4, 5 and 6 years, respectively.\n\nIn  the  securitisation  market,  the  group  placed  two  public transactions in 2023. The first transaction for \u20ac719 million in securities  backed  by  automotive  loans  granted  by  its German  branch.  The  second  transaction  issued  for \u20ac737 million worth of securities (including \u20ac100 million selfsubscribed)  backed  by  auto  lease-to-own  receivables granted  by  its  French  subsidiary.

Within the Flins ReFactory, Mobilize is centralising initiatives to extend\n\nthe  life  cycle  of  vehicles  and  batteries.  It  implements solutions for the reuse of batteries, in particular for energy storage solutions, and thus supports the energy transition.\n\n## 1.3.3 Renault- Nissan- Mitsubishi Alliance\n\n## 1.3.3.1 General Overview\n\n2023 saw the opening of a new chapter and the realisation of  a  new  impetus  for  the  Alliance,  based  on  the  solid foundations  of  a  long-standing  partnership.  The  New Alliance  Agreement  between  Renault  Group  and  Nissan, which  entered  into  force  on  8  November  2023,  marks  an important  milestone  for  the  three  partners:  it  lays  the foundations  for  a  new  long-term,  balanced,  efficient  and agile  collaboration  that  will  maximise  value  creation  for each of its members, as well as for all our stakeholders. This new Alliance, focused on concrete projects with high added value,  will  continue  its  efforts  to  identify  key  projects  in  all markets,  creating  additional  growth  opportunities,  relying on  each  company's  technologies  and  improving  their operational  efficiency.  It  will  boost  their  innovations  and their transformation in the rapidly changing automotive and new mobility markets.\n\nThis  agreement  aims  to  maximise  collaboration  between Renault Group, Nissan and Mitsubishi Motors in three areas: high value creation operational projects, increased strategic agility with new initiatives which partners can join, rebalanced  cross-shareholdings  between  Renault  Group and Nissan and strengthened Alliance governance.\n\n## 1.3.3.2 New chapter of the Alliance partnership\n\n## Operational projects with high value creation\n\nIn line with the Alliance 2030 roadmap, and as part of the new Alliance principles that came into effect on 8 November 2023, the  three  Companies  announced  new  key  projects  in  Latin America, India and Europe, not only on vehicles but also on new automotive  ecosystems,  which  aim  to  achieve  mutually beneficial, large-scale and tangible results in three dimensions: markets, vehicles and technologies. Each company will benefit from these projects that create value and generate synergies such as significant short-term cost reductions.\n\n## In Latin America\n\n- \u25cf The successful collaboration on the existing family of 1 ton Nissan  Frontier/Renault  Alaskan  pick-ups  will  continue. Renault Group will produce pick-ups in C\u00f3rdoba (Argentina) for Renault Group and Nissan;\n- \u25cf The new \u00bd ton pick-up developed by Renault Group and recently unveiled under the name Niagara will also be for Nissan, which will market it under its own brand, as in the case of the 1-ton pick-ups above.\n\nThese two vehicles  will  also  be  manufactured  in  the  same plant in Argentina.\n\n- \u25cf Renault  Group  and  Nissan  will  develop  two  common  Asegment  electric  vehicles,  both  based  on  the  CMF-AEV platform, for the region.\n- \u25cf In  addition,  Nissan  announced  the  new  generation  of Kicks for Latin America, based on the CMF-B platform.\n\n## In India\n\n- \u25cf For  the  domestic market and export, Renault Group and Nissan  will  collaborate  on  several  new  vehicle  projects, including  four  new  SUVs,  and  a  new  Nissan  car  derived from Renault Triber.\n- \u25cf To round out this offering, and as in Latin America, Nissan and  Renault  Group  also  consider  collaborating  on  the production of A-segment electric vehicles.\n\n## In Europe\n\n- \u25cf The  ASX  and  COLT  models  that  Mitsubishi  Motors currently  markets  in  its  network  have  been  developed and  are  already  manufactured  by  Renault.  They  are based on the CMF-B platform (which already carries Clio &  Captur);  this  cooperation  is  likely  to  extend  to  other projects between Renault Group and Mitsubishi Motors.\n- \u25cf In  the  field  of  electric  vehicles,  Ampere,  the  new  Renault Group entity dedicated to electric vehicles and software, will  develop  their  first-ever  C-segment  electric  SUV  for Mitsubishi  Motors,  which  will  market  it  under  its  brand. This vehicle will first be launched on the European market and will be rolled out internationally.\n- \u25cf Building  on  its  dual  expertise  in  commercial  vehicles,  on the one hand, and electric mobility on the other, Renault Group  will  launch  its  brand-new  generation  of  electric vans in  Europe  in  2026,  the  first  vehicles  to  benefit  from the  application  of  Software-Defined  Vehicle  technology, and will share it with Nissan in joint projects.\n- \u25cf These  initiatives  will  reinforce  previous  commitments, including Nissan's future compact  electric vehicle (B-segment),  based  on  the  CMF-BEV  platform,  which  is under  development  and  will  be  produced  by  Ampere  at Renault Group's ElectriCity plant in France from 2026.\n\nI\n\n01",

All these cars are now on the market and have benefited from the 'smart differentiation' logic developed by Renault Group,  Nissan and  Mitsubishi  Motors.  This  logic  guarantees,  for  each vehicle,  the  necessary  level  of  specificities  (design, features, brand identifiers, etc.) while defining the desired sharing  concerning  platforms,  plants,  powertrains,  to generate economies of scale.\n- \u25cf The five common electric platforms, that will carry more than  80%  of  the  new  electric  vehicle  models  of  Renault Group, Nissan and Mitsubishi Motors by 2030, cover most of the markets in the largest regions:\n- -CMF-AEV, the most affordable platform, currently used for the new Dacia Spring, and which may be used (study in progress) by Renault and Nissan in Latin America and India, as previously mentioned;\n- -KEI-EV,  intended  for  ultra-compact  electric  vehicles mainly for the Japanese market;\n- -LCV-EV, a brand-new 100% electric platform developed by Renault  Group  and  designed  to  carry  nextgeneration modular electric vans also for Nissan\n- -CMF-EV,  the  versatile  electric  platform  that  already carries  Nissan  Ariya,  the  electric  Renault  M\u00e9gane E-Tech, but also the future Renault Scenic, and the first C-segment  electric  SUV  from  Mitsubishi  Motors.  The electric  successors  of  the  new  Juke  and  new  LEAF  will also be based on this platform.\n- -CMF-BEV,  the  new  compact  electric  platform,  will  be launched  in  2024,  and  will  be  fitted  to  Renault,  Alpine and Nissan brand vehicles. Among the vehicles are the\n\n- Renault  R5  and  the  new  compact  EV  that  will  replace the Nissan Micra.\n- -The new electric C-SUV as well as the electric compact vehicle that will  replace  Micra,  both  mentioned  above, are  of  100%  Mitsubishi  Motors  and  Nissan  design respectively and are being developed by Ampere to be produced in the Northern France electric industrial hub.\n\n## Cooperation  also  continues  in  the  area  of  advanced technologies\n\n- \u25cf In  the  field  of  connected  mobility,  the  Alliance  members were  the  first  global  general  carmakers  to  offer  the Google  ecosystem  in  their  cars;  this  system  is  currently being rolled out across the entire range  of the 3  manufacturers,  and  by  2026,  more  than  5  million vehicles connected to the Alliance Cloud will be delivered per year, bringing the total number of connected cars on the road to more than 25 million.\n- \u25cf For the next generation, Renault Group, via its subsidiary Ampere,  is  developing  a  centralised  electrical  and electronic  architecture  that  brings  together  hardware and software applications to deliver optimum performance.  The  all-new  generation  of  electric  utility vehicles  currently  being  developed  by  Renault  and  for which Nissan will be a customer, is defined around the full Software-Defined  Vehicle  and  will  be  launched  in  2026. Vehicles designed in this way will benefit from automatic real-time  updates  throughout  their  life  cycle.  This  will mean  greater  value  added  for  customers,  in  particular with the integration of the car into their digital ecosystem to  offer  them  a  personalised  experience,  new  enhanced services  and  reduced  maintenance  costs.  In  addition, these  vehicles  will be able to communicate  with connected objects, users and infrastructure,  opening  up new  areas  of  value  creation  for  the  three  companies. Their  digital  experience  will  be  the  gateway  to  an unprecedented  amount  of  data,  paving  the  way  to  the automotive  industry's  next  frontiers,  positioned  at  the forefront of this revolution.\n- \u25cf In  the area of batteries, thanks to its in-depth expertise in battery technology, Nissan will be the leader when it comes to  innovations  in  this  area.  ASSB  (All-Solid-State  Battery) will double the energy density versus current liquid lithiumion batteries. Charging time will also be cut by a factor of three,  enabling  customers  to  make  longer  journeys  in greater  comfort.  The  aim  is  to  mass-produce  ASSB technology before 2030 and, in the future,  to  achieve  the same  cost  as  that  of  combustion  engine  vehicles, accelerating the transition to electric vehicles worldwide.\n\nThese  two  examples  (Software-Defined  Vehicle  and  AllSolid-State Batteries) will be supplemented by many others: twice a year, 'Tech Show Cases' will be organised at which the three companies will present new technologies that the other partners can join in with or adopt, in the context of a customer/supplier relationship.",

They complement the objectives and initiatives  of  Nissan  and  Mitsubishi  Motors  in  Europe  and potentially other markets.\n\n## \u25cf Horse\n\n- -Nissan  will  be  a  customer  of  Horse,  a  Renault  Group initiative to increase scale effects and market coverage for its low emission hybrid (ICE) and internal combustion powertrain technologies.\n- -Horse will deliver 6 families of gearboxes and engines to 12  Nissan  plants,  approximately  500,000  units,  and  is intended to supply many industrial customers, including potentially Mitsubishi Motors.\n\nThese  initiatives  would  complement  existing  areas  of technological  collaboration,  such  as  the  Software-Defined Vehicle (SDV) developed by Renault, the ASSB (All Solid-State Battery) and the Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and autonomous driving systems developed by Nissan.\n\n## Rebalanced cross-shareholdings between Renault Group and Nissan and strengthened Alliance governance\n\nFollowing  the  announcements  made  on  6  February  and 26  July  2023,  and  after  obtaining  the  required  regulatory\n\nthe company,\n\n| presentation of   | Sustainable   | Corporate   | Risk and   | Financial   | the capital and the   | Annual general   | Additional   |\n|-------------------|---------------|-------------|------------|-------------|-----------------------|------------------|--------------|\n| Renault Group     | development   | governance  | control    | statements  | share ownership       | meeting          | information  |\n\n## General presentation of Renault Group\n\napprovals,  the  New  Alliance  Agreement  between  Renault Group and Nissan came into force on 8 November 2023. It formalises the rebalancing of cross-shareholdings between Renault  Group  and  Nissan  and  replaces  the  previous agreements  governing  the  Alliance  (i.e.  the  Restated Alliance Master Agreement, the Alliance Equity Participation Agreement  and  the  Memorandum  of  Understanding  of 12 March 2019).\n\nAs a result, following the entry into force of the New Alliance Agreement, Renault Group and Nissan now hold a 15% crossshareholding, with respective lock-up and standstill obligations limiting their holdings to 15%. The voting rights of Renault  Group  and  Nissan  are  capped  at  15%  of  the exercisable  voting  rights,  with  the  possibility  for  both companies to freely exercise their voting rights within such limit.\n\nOn  8  November  2023,  Renault  transferred  28.4%  of  Nissan shares  (out  of  a  total  of  43.4%)  to  a  French  trust,  where voting  rights  are  exercised  in  a  neutral  manner,  subject  to certain exceptions. Renault Group continues to benefit fully from  the  economic  rights  (dividends  and  share  sale proceeds) attached to the shares held by the trust until the sale of these shares. Since 8 November 2023, Renault Group can instruct the trustee to sell the Nissan shares held in the trust,  without being required to do so within a specific predetermined period of time. Renault Group has full discretion to dispose of the Nissan shares held in the trust, as part of a process  organised  and  coordinated  with  Nissan  and  in which Nissan has a right of first offer, for its own benefit or for the benefit of a designated third party.\n\nThe transfer by Renault Group of Nissan shares in the trust has  not  resulted  in  any  impairment  in  the  Renault  Group financial statements.\n\nRenault  Group  now  benefits  from  greater  flexibility  in  its capital  allocation  policy  thanks  to  the  possibility  of monetising Nissan shares.\n\nFollowing the entry into force of the New Alliance Agreement, Renault Group began, on 13 December 2023, the monetisation of the 28.4% of Nissan shares transferred to the French trust. Renault  Group  sold  211,000,000  Nissan  shares  to  Nissan, representing  5%  of  Nissan's  capital,  for  a  sale  value  of \u20ac764 million. Following the cancellation, decided by Nissan, of the shares gained as part of this acquisition, Renault Group's direct  stake  mechanically  and  automatically  increased  to 15.79% of Nissan's capital. The French trust of which Renault Group is the beneficiary now holds 24.63% of Nissan shares. In accordance  with  the  New  Alliance  Agreement,  Renault Group is not obliged to divest the 0.79% in excess of the 15%, and Nissan continues to hold a stake in Renault Group of 15% of the exercisable voting rights.\n\nI\n\n01",

The statements include intermediate operating results and some Nissan-specific indicators.  In  order  to  measure  the  contribution  to Renault's  results,  Nissan's  financial  statements  are restated  as  described  in  chapter  5,  note  12  to  the consolidated  financial  statements.  Nissan's  financial year  begins  on  1  April  and  ends  on  31  March  of  the following year.\n\nGeneral presentation of Renault Group\n\n## 1.3.3.8 Nissan 2023 financial year after nine months\n\nFor the nine months ended 31 December 2023, Nissan's net income  was  a  profit  of  325.0  billion  yen  (compared  with  a profit  of  115.0  billion  yen  for  the  nine  months  ended 31 December 2022). The operating margin was \u00a5478.4 billion for the period, representing a margin of 5.2% on net turnover of  \u00a59.2  trillion.  Nissan  sold  2.4  million  vehicles  worldwide  in the  first  nine  months  of  the  2023  financial  year,  a  1.2% increase compared with the previous year.\n\n## 1.3.3.9 Nissan's contribution to Renault's 2023 consolidated net income\n\nNissan's contribution to Renault's profits in 2023 is described in chapter 5, note 12 of the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## 1.3.4 Partnerships and cooperation\n\n## Strategic cooperation between the RenaultNissan-Mitsubishi Alliance and Mercedes-Benz AG\n\nRefer  to  the  'Strategic  cooperation'  paragraph,  chapter 1.3.3 of this document.\n\n## A horizontal integration strategy:\n\nIn  order to accelerate its transformation and excel in each of  the  new  value  chains  (technological,  industrial,  circular, services,  etc.),  the  Group  adopts  a  collaborative  approach whenever  possible,  with  the  best  players  in  their  field. This  active  policy  of  partnerships  makes  it  possible  to  coinvest,  co-develop, cover a wider range of innovations and share risks. Depending on the activities, partnerships are of different types, such as joint ventures, strategic partnerships,  to  co-develop  a  product,  supply  contracts  or equity investments in companies.\n\n## In the field of electric vehicles\n\nPartnerships  have  been  signed  with  Whylot  (a  French startup in which Renault Group holds a 21% stake) to develop and  industrialise  an  innovative  axial  flow  e-engine  on  a large scale, with Airbus to develop next-generation battery systems and with the CEA to develop a very high-efficiency bidirectional charger. Partnerships are also being developed with the best in the field of software, notably with Google,  Qualcomm  and  Valeo.  But  Renault  Group  also benefits from strong in-house software skills and expertise, following the integration of the Intel teams in 2017 and the creation  of  the  Software  Factory  in  2020.  The  Group  thus relies  on  2,800  specialist  Tech engineers, including 1,500 at the Toulouse and Sophia-Antipolis sites alone.\n\nFor the production of batteries for its future electric vehicles, Renault  Group  has  mainly  chosen  two  strategic  partners, whose battery plants will be located in France, close to the ElectriCity division: Envision AESC and Verkor.\n\nEnvision  AESC,  a  global  player  in  battery  technology  and plants. This partner will install a gigafactory in Douai with a capacity  of  9  GWh  in  2024,  with  the  objective  of  reaching 24 GWh by 2030. The aim is to produce state-of-the-art, lowcarbon batteries that are cost-competitive for the Group's electric models, including the future R5.\n\nVerkor,  a  French  startup  specialising  in  the  development  of battery cells, in which the Group holds a 19% stake. Its future gigafactory  located  in  Dunkirk  will  supply  each  year  the equivalent of 12 GWh of batteries that will equip vehicles in the upper  segments  of  the  Renault  Group  brands  and  in particular, from 2025, the future 100% electric C-Crossover GT from Alpine which will be manufactured in Dieppe, France.\n\nThe  Group  also  announced  the  creation  of  a  joint  venture with  Minth  Group  to  produce  battery  boxes  for  electric vehicles.  This  joint  venture  will  install  two  new  production lines  in  Ruitz  in  2023,  with  a  capacity  of  300,000  battery boxes per year by 2025.\n\nIn line with its industrial decarbonisation trajectory, in 2022 the company  signed  three  major  partnerships,  including  the largest green electricity supply contract in France with Voltalia and a deep geothermal energy project in Douai with Engie.\n\nTo secure its supply of raw materials, the Group has signed strategic  partnerships  with  Vulcan  Energy,  Arverne  Group, Terrafame and Managem Group.\n\nI\n\n01",

The ability to innovate is supported by levers such as  the  network  of  experts  or  the  numerous  partnerships. Research and Advanced Engineering activities are managed  transversally  within  the  various  Engineering sectors  via  a  structured  plan  shared  throughout  the company. This global plan covers all vehicle and mechanical,  product,  process,  after-sales  and  service applications. The innovations developed are developed for the benefit of brands, business and customers.\n\nRenault Group identifies the key innovations of tomorrow very early  on.  This  might  be  a  very  innovative  product  concept, such as the minivan in 1983 or the first Renault Twizy and Zoe electric  vehicles  in  the  early  2010s.  A  real  breakthrough  can also be a major technological advance, such as the hydrogen engine. New  uses  can  also  give  rise to high-value breakthroughs such as new mobility services, data monetisation  and  battery  second  life.  Regulatory  changes such as the ban on combustion-engine vehicles in Europe by 2035 for the sale of new cars should also be considered.\n\nResearch and Advanced Engineering activities are divided into 4 perfectly complementary categories.\n\nThe Research Plan and doctoral theses (most of which are under  the  CIFRE  Convention)  make  it  possible  to  enlighten the future and prepare for future technological breakthroughs.  Their  purpose  is  to  identify,  anticipate  and prepare Renault Group for future trends to be incorporated into developments over the next 5 to 10 years.\n\nThe  Technological  Plan makes  it  possible  to  prepare innovations  for  vehicle  or  component  applications  by developing new technologies within 3 to 5 years. It shows the innovations  to  be  introduced  in  the  platforms,  engines, systems and vehicle range plan.\n\nThese two plans are based on three main pillars: the planet, regions and people.\n\nResearch and Advanced Engineering are also at the helm of a  large  number of demonstrators (Demonstrator Plan) ,  the aim of which is to inspire the future range plan by bringing together  technological  building  blocks  to  test  innovations against realistic integration in a vehicle, and thus potentially give rise to new vehicle concepts.\n\nFinally, an essential focus is the development of simulation/ validation  tools  and  models  through  the Engineering Performance  Plan . The  aim  of  this  plan  is  to  make breakthroughs  in  methodologies,  expertise  and  multiple skills (business, process, sales, marketing, organisation and management).\n\nThe Process  Plan makes  it  possible  to  work  on  the innovations to be rolled out in manufacturing.\n\nThe Research and Advanced Engineering Plan is a common Alliance plan that is structured around the plans presented above to fully meet the prioritised needs of Product, Design and Engineering. The aim is to develop innovations for future customers  and  to  guarantee  the  competitiveness  of  the vehicle  range  by  pooling  the  development  capacities  of both  companies,  where  the  objectives  are  common. Cooperation  with  the  Alliance  also  makes  it  possible  to increase Renault Group's patent portfolio.\n\nThe  budget  for  Research  and  Advanced  Engineering activities  in  2022  is  distributed  through  these  4  plans. Engineering  is  a  strong  contributor  to  Technology  and Innovation through its skills but also through its product and service  offerings.  In  the  midst  of  change,  the  automotive world  will  have  to  face  two  major  challenges: energy transition and digital  transition as  well  as changes  in  our uses . To  meet  these  challenges,  three  priority  technical areas  guide  the  allocation  of  the  budget: tools  to  improve the efficiency of engineering, the centralised electrical and electronic  architecture  (Software  Defined  Vehicle)  and electro-mobility (engines, load issues, etc.).\n\nI\n\n01",

These  are  also true  for  the  automotive  sector.  In  the  context  of  two simultaneous revolutions (digital and energy transition), the fundamentals of the  market  as  well  as  the  regulatory  and technological  bases  are  or  will  all  be  called  into  question. For the company, this means standing out by knowing and listening to our markets -translated into permanent innovation -and  gaining  a  position  on  new  sectors  of activity,  with  a  high  degree  of  scientific  and  technical knowledge.  In  this  context,  where  the  mobilisation  and transformation  of  knowledge  are  becoming  strategic,  the expertise sector occupies a central position by providing the means  to  identify  and  then  capture  the  value  created  by knowledge in order to use it to drive Renaulution and offer the  company  a  competitive  advantage.  The  expertise sector  represents  43  strategic  areas  of  expertise  such  as 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Electrical and Electronic Architecture',  'Immersive  simulation  and  virtual  reality', 'Manufacturing',  'logistics',  etc.  This  sector  is  organised into four levels of expertise:\n\n- \u25cf The Expert Fellow guarantees  the definition and consistency  of  the  strategic  areas  of  expertise.  It coordinates  the  network  of  Lead  Experts  in  order  to structure their output at both prospective and operational levels concerning technical or methodological  innovations  and  support  for  projects under development. The collaborative work carried out as part  of  the  expertise  projects  contributes  to  the  shared\n\nprogress  of  the  businesses  involved  in  the  company's major  challenges  (energy  in  the  vehicle,  coupling  of complex systems, additive manufacturing, etc.). The network of experts can thus be described as an agile organisation serving the cross-business and the construction  of  shared  roadmaps  up  to  CEO  level  for strategic technologies;\n\n- \u25cf the  43  Expert  Leaders ,  each  reporting  to  a  Department Head, are responsible for their roadmap. Responsible for one of the areas of strategy expertise, they structure and guide  their  internal  network  of  experts  and  use  an external network consisting of universities, other manufacturers,  associations,  incubation  structures,  etc., to enable the Company to work in an 'extended' way;\n- \u25cf the  250  Experts are  in  charge  of  secondary  fields  of expertise, responsible for benchmarks, identifying relevant partners and investing in the protection of knowhow  through  patents.  They  are  also  responsible  for defining and promoting standards and processes;\n- \u25cf the  500  Consultants further  the  state  of  the  art  in  their practice,  developing  standards  on  which  the  teams  can then capitalise.\n\nThe  organisation  of  the  network  of  experts  and  its  agile mode of operation allow the way ahead to be mapped out using  a  set  of  coherent  roadmaps,  the  enhancement  of knowledge  to  be  accelerated  through  innovation  and  the performance of operations, thus allowing the business lines to excel in their various areas of expertise.",

The  Labs  have  been  in  existence  for  a decade  and  complement  other  Renault  Group  processes and entities. They make it possible to do unscheduled, rapid innovation  in  test  &  learning  mode  by  'doing  it  yourself'. Historically born in France in the wake of the Fab Labs and Maker  culture,  the  Creative  Lab  has  introduced  several hundred employees to the use of rapid prototyping methods (3D  printing,  engraving,  cutting,  thermoforming,  etc.).  The Creative Lab with its themed Labs (Smart EV Lab, ElectronicShaker  Lab,  Car  Data  Lab,  AfterSales  Lab,  etc.)  brings together  the  Group's  community  of  makers.  It  is  able  to support  project  initiators  from  idea  to  completion,  assist with technology projects and launch challenges for Renault Group brands. The Labs are used to develop in-house knowhow and skills on innovation topics. As another example, the Collective  Intelligence  Laboratory  is  run  by  an  in-house group of coaches, facilitators and transformation specialists who advise other groups within the company and synchronise collective intelligence activities between these different sectors.\n\nThe  other  Labs  are  located  in  strategic  areas  where  the automotive and services world are changing rapidly: Israel, China and Brazil in order to ensure continuous technological\n\nthe company,\n\nthe capital and the\n\nshare ownership\n\nGeneral presentation of Renault Group\n\nmonitoring  of  emerging  trends,  increased  knowledge  of customer needs as close as possible to the ground and also to  strengthen the link with technology partners worldwide. The  Labs  can  also  be  used  to  test  the  potential  of  a partnership with a startup.\n\n## 1.4.2.4 Innovation partnerships\n\nThe vehicle of tomorrow will be energy efficient, highly light, connected and capable of replacing the driver for all or part of  their  activities;  this  is  a  challenge  that  can  only  be  met collectively. For Renault Group, collaborative R&D contracts not  only  speed  up  the  development  of  the  technologies needed to meet these challenges, but also enhance skills by sharing costs: a key lever for bringing innovations to fruition more quickly, so that they can be introduced more fully into vehicle projects. In a world  of  competitive  industry, performance  and  frugality,  whether  with  industrial  or academic partners, this type of collaborative innovation is encouraged  by  public  funding  bodies  at  both  French  and European  level.  In  the  form  of  public  support  (subsidies, repayable  advances),  it  provides  additional  leverage  to accelerate  innovation.  In  this  context,  the  participation  of Renault Group in cooperative initiatives has always been a priority  in  Research  and  Advanced  Engineering  activities, which is an effective tool for the growth of the 'Renaulution' strategic  plan.  In  2023,  Renault  managed  a  portfolio  of  60 subsidised  projects  on  average,  divided  equally  between French and European projects. 26 projects were submitted during the year (+30% vs 2022): 2 have been accepted, 22 are still being processed and 2 have been rejected.\n\nIn  2023,  Renault  will  have  submitted  16  ambitious  projects  as part of the 'Automotive Investment Support' call for projects and  has  developed  its  European  network  with  active participation in EUCAR  and  partnerships,  enabling  the submission of 14 European collaborative projects covering all the technologies of the future (battery, SDV, etc.).\n\n## Academic partners\n\nRenault Group has always worked with leading universities and  the  best  academic  partners.  In  2023,  the  CIFRE campaign  led  to  the  collection  and  validation  of  47  thesis topics (up 30% on 2022). Below are some examples of theses initiated in 2023:\n\n- \u25cf Advanced control of multiphase synchronous actuators;\n- \u25cf Modelling  of  Dry  Process  electrode  manufacturing processes;\n- \u25cf AI for 360\u00b0 marketing efficiency assessment & recommendations.\n\nI\n\n01",

The  challenge  lies  in  the  speed  of development of a new electronic architecture for the vehicle of the  future,  and  therefore  in  the  sovereignty  of  the  French automotive  industry,  by  imposing  a  French  standard  for software services and the future ecosystem. The project came to  a  successful  conclusion in  2023,  with  the  final  key  stage  of the  project  being  passed  at  an  event  at  the  Technocentre attended by all the project partners and the funder.\n\n## 1.4.2.5 Technology partners\n\nIn order  to  constantly  explore  new  opportunities  for innovation, Renault Group partners with the best companies on the market in multiple areas.\n\nFor battery cells, Renault Group has chosen to partner with Envision  AESC,  which  will  develop  a  gigafactory  in  Douai with a capacity of 9 GWh in 2024 aiming at reaching 24 GWh by  2030.  Close  to  Renault  ElectriCity,  Renault  Group's partner  will  produce  latest  technology,  cost-competitive, low-carbon and safe batteries for electric models, including the future Renault 5.\n\nRenault Group  has  also  signed  a  Memorandum  of Understanding  to  become  a  shareholder  of  the French startup Verkor with a stake of 19% .  The two partners intend to co-develop a high-performance battery suitable for the C and higher segments of the Renault range, as well as for the Alpine models. The partnership also includes the development of a pilot production line in France for battery cells  and  module  prototyping  from  2022.  In  a  second  step, starting from 2026, Verkor aims to build the first gigafactory for  high  performance  batteries  in  France,  with  an  initial capacity  of  10  GWh  for  Renault  Group,  potentially  rising  to 20 GWh by 2030.\n\nRenault  Group  continues  to  stay  one  step  ahead  of  the competition, being the first manufacturer to develop its own electric  motor -without  rare  earths (i.e.  no  permanent magnets) and based on EESM  (Electrically Excited Synchronous  Motor) technology  -  and  its  own  reduction gearbox.  Having  already  made  most  of  the  investments needed  to  master  these  technologies,  Renault  Group  has been able to halve the cost of its batteries over the last ten years and will halve it again over the next decade. Renault Group will gradually embed new technological improvements from 2024 on its EESM, which will lower costs and improve the efficiency of the motor.\n\nIn 2023, Renault Group has announced a third-generation, more compact electric motor, co-developed with Val\u00e9o: the E7A.\n\nRenault Group has also signed a partnership with the French startup  Whylot for an  innovative  automotive  axial  flux  emotor . This  technology  will  first  be  applied  on  hybrid powertrains aiming to reduce the costs by 5% while saving up  to  2.5  g  CO2  on  WLTP  (for  B/C-segment  passenger  car). Renault Group will be the first OEM to produce an axial flux e-motor on a large scale from 2025.",

With  a  compact  design,  this  One  Box Project will be 800V compliant, with fewer parts to reduce the cost,  and  will  be  used  across  all  platforms  and  powertrains (BEV, HEV, PHEV) for further scale effect. Power modules for the inverter,  DC-DC converter and OBC will rely respectively on silicon carbide (SiC) and gallium nitride (GaN) thanks to our strategic partnership signed with STMicroelectronics .\n\nOn  top  of  these  new  technologies,  Renault  Group  is  also working on a more compact e-powertrain called the all-inone system. This e-powertrain combines the electric motor, reduction  gearbox  and  power  electronics  in  a  single  unit, saving 45% in  overall  volume (equivalent  to  the  volume  of the  fuel  tank  in  the  current  Clio),  reducing  the cost  of  the overall  powertrain  by  30% (this  saving  in  value  being equivalent  to  the  cost  of  the  electric  motor),  and  reducing the energy  lost  by  45% under  WLTP,  giving  an  additional range gain of 20 km for an electric vehicle.\n\nOther innovation technology partnerships are presented in Chapter 1.2.1.7: Partnerships and Cooperations .\n\n## 1.4.2.6 Patent registration\n\nWith  the  challenges  posed  by  climate  change  and  the development  of  digital  technology,  mobility  is  changing rapidly. This real change of era is opening up new fields, and technological  breakthroughs  are  occurring  ever  more rapidly in a wide range of areas. Renault Group is adapting its  strategy  to  position  itself  as  a  key  player  in  the  sector. Renault Group has always known how to innovate, and the significant acceleration already seen in 2022 (+35% vs 2021) and  confirmed  in  2023  (+23%  vs  2022)  in  the  number  of patents registered in full ownership reflects the extent of the technological shift the company is undergoing, for example in  software  or  services.  For  example,  more  than  250  new patents have been filed in connection with our technological roadmaps  focused  on  connected  vehicles  and  electric vehicles. This figure demonstrates the vitality of innovation within  Renault  Group  and  its  desire  to  increase  the protection of its inventions internally or with its partners in these strategic areas, also leaving room for the protection of creativity outside these areas.\n\nRenault  Group  also  continues  to  be  inventive  in  its recognised  areas  of  expertise,  particularly  in  terms  of engines. A very good example is the coiled rotor technology, derived  from  the  development  of  the  Zoe  and  used  in  the collaboration  with  Valeo.  The  partnership  with  Whylot, announced  in  November  2022,  to  create  a  new  type  of electric  motor,  is  another.  The  new  patents  filed  as  part  of these partnerships cover a range of innovations applicable to  the  engine,  but  also  to  the  charging  system,  battery, thermal management, architecture and acoustics.\n\nIndustrialisation  solutions  have  also  been  patented.  The ability to integrate new technology on an industrial scale is one of Renault Group's strengths and a definite contribution to the partnerships in which Renault Group is involved.\n\nIn 2023, Renault Group had 14,500 patents in its portfolio.\n\nthe company,\n\n| presentation of   | Sustainable   | Corporate   | Risk and   | Financial   | the capital and the   | Annual general   | Additional   |\n|-------------------|---------------|-------------|------------|-------------|-----------------------|------------------|--------------|\n| Renault Group     | development   | governance  | control    | statements  | share ownership       | meeting          | information  |\n\nGeneral presentation of Renault Group\n\n## 1.4.2.7 Digital transformation\n\nDue  to  the  growing  complexity  of  vehicles  (electrification, connected vehicles,  driving  aids,  etc.),  the  explosion  of  onboard software and increasing regulatory pressure, Renault Group is strengthening the configuration management and development processes for systems and software as well as their  validation  through  its  digital  transformation.  This transformation will enable the entire company to collaborate  securely,  seamlessly  and  efficiently  in  a  single environment.  All  parties  involved  in  the  design  (Process, Purchasing,  Costing,  Design,  Quality,  etc.)  and  validation processes, as well as partners and suppliers, will make the data on the vehicle product accessible around Digital Twins throughout its life cycle with the aim of reducing costs and lead times.\n\nRenault  Group's  digital  transformation  continues  with  the 'Renaulution Virtual Twin' programme. The Enterprise PLM (Product Life cycle Management) project, renamed 'Renaulution Virtual Twin', is a major programme that aims to transform and bring Renault's design into a new era. This project  will  provide  engineering  and  all  of  the  company's upstream businesses with a new digital tool for  managing its  product  data  and  mobility  services.  Thanks  to  the extension  of  the  digitalisation  of  Engineering  to  the company,  this  tool  will  offer  a  platform  for  collaboration from  design  to  after-sales  around  the  digital  twin  (single source of truth).\n\nFollowing  20  years  of  collaboration,  Renault  Group  and Dassault  Syst\u00e8mes  are  strengthening  their  partnership  to contribute  to  the  'Renaulution'  strategic  plan.  In  an unprecedented  deployment  for  an  industrial  company, Renault Group is adopting Dassault Syst\u00e8mes' 3DEXPERIENCE platform in the Cloud on a global scale.\n\nThis  enterprise  platform  will  make  it  possible  to  reduce vehicle  development  costs  and  time.  It  will  form  a  new backbone for sharing, in real time, all the data linked to the product throughout its life cycle and managing digital twins in all the required configurations.\n\nMore than 20,000 Renault Group employees will benefit from digital  twin  experiences  to  improve  data  sharing  and collaboration across the company.\n\nThis programme enabled the first deployments, from design to industrialisation and after-sales, to begin in 2022. It aims to have a fully deployed solution by 2025.\n\nIn 2023, more than 4,000 users were trained. From the concept freeze milestone, a new innovative vehicle for the Renaulution (platform  and  upperbodies)  was  developed  with  Renaulution Virtual  Twin,  bringing  on  board  all  the  upstream  functions (product/process/after-sales engineering, purchasing, costing, quality, etc.). Following this first successful pilot programme, all new vehicles are now designed on the 3DExperience platform. Reducing  the  cost  of  vehicles  in  mass  production  was  also equipped with Dassault Syst\u00e8mes' data science and artificial intelligence  (AI)  solutions  by  designating  data  managed  by legacy systems of the major functions (Engineering, Purchasing, Costing, Manufacturing).\n\nI\n\n01",

This breakthrough contributed  to  a  reduction  in  validation  costs  (prototypes and  physical  tests)  of  more  than  50%  and  a  reduction  in development time of 25% between 2019 and 2023.\n\nDigital  simulation  can  be  used  to  simulate  and  assess vehicle performance in terms of crashworthiness, aerodynamics, acoustics, endurance, thermodynamics, etc., without  the  need  for  expensive  physical  prototypes.  It  can also be used to simulate on-board systems (ADAS, systems\n\nand  software,  energy  management,  etc.)  and  anticipate their  tune-ups.  Immersive  simulation  brings  the  human element  back  into  the  digital  twin  validation  loop,  using virtual  reality  tools  or  driving  simulators.  In  2023,  Renault Group  inaugurated  ROADS,  the  world's  largest  driving simulator, a new high-performance tool.\n\nThe  massive  arrival  of  artificial  intelligence  and  data management technologies within engineering is a new lever to  accelerate  the  efficiency  of  digital  technology  in  design and help reduce development times for Renaulution vehicles.\n\n## 1.4.3 Digital and energy transitions: a challenge for innovation\n\n## 1.4.3.1 Digital transition\n\nSoftware  will  play  an  increasingly  important  role  in  the vehicle of tomorrow, whether for human-machine interfaces,  multimedia  and  connected  services,  or  driver assistance  systems.  It  is  necessary  to  respond  to  the customer's growing need for content and services enriched over  time  and  throughout  the  life  of  the  vehicle,  thanks to  the  software. We also need to be able to accommodate the  maturing  of  new  technological  solutions  for  the automotive industry.\n\n## Software Defined Vehicle\n\nTo  meet this  digital  transition  challenge,  the  company  has set itself the task of responding to the necessary changes in on-board  software  architecture.  The  partnership  with Google  and  Qualcomm  announced  at  the  end  of  2022  will help develop the connected car of tomorrow. The Software Defined  Vehicle  will  bring  together  the  best  of  the automotive  and  digital  worlds,  to  offer  new  services  on demand  and  enable  continuous  updates  on  vehicles, building  on  the  existing  collaboration  around  Android Automotive  which  will  be  consolidated  by  Renault  Group with its partners in a vehicle operating system (CAR-OS).\n\nThe Software-Defined Vehicle will allow new functionalities and services to be introduced more and more quickly from a development in the Cloud and automatically ported to the vehicle.  This  centralisation  of  the  architecture  has  the advantage  of  reducing  costs  thanks  to  a  reduction  in  the number of  computers;  improving  the  speed  and  fluidity  of data exchanges as well as enabling better data valuation to extend  the  services  offered  to  customers.  The  SoftwareDefined Vehicle opens up a huge range of possibilities, with new market opportunities and technological innovations.\n\n## 1.4.3.2 Energy transition\n\nRenault Group is committed to achieving a zero CO2 impact by  2040  in  Europe  and  by  2050  worldwide.  To  support  the achievement  of  its  sustainable  development  goals,  the Group develops innovative solutions to reduce the\n\nemissions of its vehicles and develop a low-carbon battery, taking into account its entire life cycle.\n\n## Battery technology\n\nSince  2022,  all  new  models  sold  have  had  an  electric  or electrified  version,  in  a  European  market  that  will  be  100% electric by 2035.\n\nSince  announcing  its  electric  vehicle  offensive  in  early  2007, Renault Group has drawn on its recognised in-house expertise (electrochemistry, materials science, thermal modelling, control electronics, high-voltage networks, mechanical packaging, etc.) to make the wisest choices in terms of lithiumion  (Li-ion)  cells,  modules  and  battery  packs,  so  as  to  offer  its electric  and  hybrid  vehicles  solutions  at  the  highest  level  in terms of range (energy density), durability, reliability, cost and, of course, safety, which remains the priority objective. The fact that  more  than  760,000  Renault  electric  vehicles  have  been sold in Europe since 2011 without a single major battery-related incident (no electric shocks or fires) is evidence of this.\n\nRenault  Group's  ambition  today  is  to  develop  a  'made  in France' battery that is green, carbon-free and environmentally  responsible,  with  the  aim  of  reducing  the carbon  footprint  of  its  batteries  by  up  to  35%  by  2030 (reference: Zoe 2019).\n\nIts  expertise  has  enabled  Renault  Group  to  build  effective partnerships  with  world-class  cell  suppliers,  with  a  view  to creating  ecosystems,  and  promising  collaborations  on  the various  stages  of  the  life  cycle  or  energy  services associated with vehicle charging.\n\nRenault  Group  continues  to  push  current  Li-ion  technology  in several  directions:  energy  density  (to  further  increase  the vehicle's range or to reduce the volume of the battery pack), but also the charging power or the cost of the batteries, depending on the uses and performance targeted for each vehicle.\n\nRenault  Group  is  also  exploring  technological  solutions aimed at  offering  the  best  compromise  between  cost  and performance depending on the type of vehicle and its use. These avenues of exploration concern both the chemistry of the batteries and the structure of the cells and the pack.",

Renault Group is a pioneer in this global  approach,  contributing  to  the  development  of greener industrial processes and the emergence of 'second life' applications for batteries. (see 2.2.2.1.2.2)\n\nDuring  the  vehicle  use  phase,  Renault  Group  is  developing vehicle-to-grid  (V2G)  solutions,  enabling  energy  to  be  fed back into the grid from an electric car's battery. The future Renault  5  electric  will  be  the  first  Renault  car  to  use  the Mobilize V2G service to turn the electric vehicle into a source of energy for the home and for the electricity grid, providing additional  flexibility  and  facilitating  the  integration  of renewable energies into the energy mix.*\n\nAt the end of their first life in the vehicle, batteries still offer up  to  2/3  of  their  initial  capacity.  Mobilize  develops  new stationary or mobile storage applications, in which batteries are reused for a second life.\n\nRenault  Group  has  solid  know-how in  the  collection  and recycling  of  electric  vehicle  batteries. Overall, nearly 6,000 batteries have already been recycled. At its ReFactory site  in  Flins,  dedicated  to  the  circular  economy,  Renault Group  has  facilities  for  retrofitting,  reuse,  dismantling  and recycling  batteries. In  2023,  the  Flins  Expert  Battery  Repair Centre doubled its capacity to repair batteries and prepare them for a second life.\n\nTo go further in recycling, on 13 October 2022, Renault Group announced the creation of The Future Is NEUTRAL, the first company  to  operate  across  the  entire  value  chain  of  the automotive  circular  economy,  which  aims  in  particular  to become a European leader in closed loop battery recycling.

Renault Group  began  upstream  studies  at  a  very  early  stage  to assess the potential of hydrogen, as part of a comprehensive 'cradle-to-grave' life cycle approach.\n\nIn June 2021, Renault Group and Plug Power, the world leader in  fuel  cell  systems  and  hydrogen  services,  created  a 50/50 joint venture called HYVIA. Based in France, the new company,  which  has  its  head  office  and  R&D  centre  in Villiers-Saint-Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric,  is  aiming  for  a  30%  share  of  the European  market  for  hydrogen-powered  light  commercial vehicles (LCVs) in 2030. HYVIA offers a complete hydrogen ecosystem,  including  the  supply  of  hydrogen-powered vehicles, recharging stations, refuelling and  services tailored to these new needs.\n\nRenault Group is also exploring other hydrogen applications, in  particular  through  prototypes  and  concept  cars,  as  well as  active  monitoring  of  the  evolution  of  the  hydrogen ecosystem, in particular at the European level. Hydrogen is also  being  studied  as  an  energy  source  for  our  plants. (See 2.2.2.1.2.2 - Climate Plan Action #7)\n\n## Low-emission combustion and hybrid engines\n\nAs  part  of  its  strategy  to  reduce  the  carbon  footprint  of combustion and hybrid engines, Renault Group is relying on E-Tech hybrid technology. Following the launch of the first generation in 2020 for the Renault range and its subsequent rollout  to  the  Dacia  range,  a  second  generation  was launched  in  2022  with  Austral.  This  technology  consists  of five main components:\n\n- \u25cf a multimode, clutchless smart gearbox resulting from our Formula  1  experience  has  been  developed  to  reduce energy  losses.  It  offers  a  strong  acceleration  capacity, intensity in mid-range acceleration and reduced consumption and CO2 emissions;\n- \u25cf an  e-engine,  the  main  electric  motor,  which  starts  the vehicle,  ensures  100%  electric  driving,  drives  the  wheels and allows the battery to be recharged;\n- \u25cf a secondary electric motor that acts as a starter and highvoltage generator for the petrol engine. It also serves as a battery regenerator - and stabiliser in gear changes;\n- \u25cf a  battery  that  stores  the  energy  necessary  for  vehicle travel  and  then  ensures  the  autonomy  of  the  vehicle  in electric mode (2kWh battery for the Astral);\n- \u25cf a combustion  engine  specially  designed  to  reduce consumption  and  CO2  emissions.  It  is  equipped  with  a particulate filter  and  combines economy, efficiency and performance.\n\nI\n\n01",

The following selection is not exhaustive.\n\n## 1.4.4.1 A290\\_ \u03b2 : a spectacular showcar that embodies electric sportiness rich in emotions\n\nThrough  its  design,  high-tech  materials  and  technologies, the A290\\_ \u03b2 (A290 'beta') exemplifies a strong ambition for the Alpine brand.\n\nTo make this show car ultra-sporty, agile and dynamic, the Alpine  development  teams  have,  for  example,  relied  on Torque  Vectoring,  which  allows  the  torque  transmitted  to each wheel to be controlled separately . A balancing act that promotes the best possible performance, both in a straight line  and  when  cornering,  for  unforgettable  sensations.  The production  car  will  also  be  equipped  with  a  torque management system suited to its design.\n\nAs for the steering wheel of the A290\\_ \u03b2 , it is directly inspired by those of the Alpine single-seaters. Its geometric design, in the shape of a joystick, incorporates very precise functions, such as the red button marked 'OV', for 'overtake', which allows  you  to  obtain  extra  power  very  quickly,  for  10 seconds . The  conditions  for  using  this  button  have  been defined to optimise safety: it can only be activated on a dry surface and reused after a waiting time at least equivalent to the time it was used. This overtake button will be present on all models in the future 100% electric Alpine range , which will thus carry a direct reference to motor racing and F1.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 1.4.4.2 With Mobilize V2G, Renault 5 E-Tech electric becomes a source of energy\n\nBased on the new AmpR Small platform (CMF-B EV), in 2024 Renault  5  E-Tech  electric  will  be  the  first  Renault that  will allow  customers  to benefit  from  the  advantages  of  the Mobilize V2G (vehicle-to-grid) service . This not only makes it possible to stop charging during peak consumption periods, but also to inject electricity back into the home, particularly when  it  is  expensive,  and  into  the  grid  when  it  is  in  high demand. Recharging is carried out when there is plenty of energy on the grid and therefore less expensive.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMobilize V2G is based on four complementary elements:\n\n- \u25cf an on-board two-way charger incorporating V2G technology;\n- \u25cf a two-way 'Made in France' terminal, Mobilize Powerbox , designed  in  collaboration  with  the  Software  R\u00e9publique teams;\n- \u25cf a Mobilize electricity contract , supplied by our technology partner The Mobility House, guaranteeing carbon-neutral electricity and enabling the energy returned to the grid to be monetised thanks to the automated control of the twoway charge;\n- \u25cf a  smartphone  app , allowing  two-way  charging  to  be programmed,  simply  by  setting  the  time  of  the  next departure and the desired battery charge level. After all, the need for mobility is always a priority.\n\nThe  electric  Renault  5's  two-way  charger  is  also  equipped with a  V2L,  vehicle-to-load  or  vehicle-to-electric  device function , which can, for example, power an electric bicycle or  barbecue  to  enjoy  an  outdoor  outing.  Thanks  to  an adapter, the future electric Renault 5 will be able to supply energy equivalent to that of a 220-volt power socket.",

The WLTP was implemented one year later for new, heavier LCVs.\n\nThe  WLTP  cycle  measuring  pollutants  in  the  laboratory  is supplemented by a procedure known as RDE (Real Driving Emissions).  The  RDE,  introduced  in  two  stages  (Eu6d-temp and Eu6d), enables emissions to be checked under real-life road conditions (driving, road profiles, meteorology, etc.).\n\nIn addition  to  the  regulations  that  apply  to  exhaust emissions,  regulations  for  evaporative  emissions  from  the fuel  system  of  petrol  vehicles  are  also  applied.  Emission levels  have  been  significantly  reduced,  and  the  new procedure  has  been  applicable  to  all  new  vehicles  since 1 September 2019.\n\nThe  (CE)  'emissions'  regulation  715/2007  does  not  confine itself  to  approval  of  new  products  but  also  requires  the inspection of customer vehicles by the manufacturer and by any  Member  State.  This  is  one  of  the  few  industries  that produce  consumer  goods  for  which  vehicle  inspection  is required at between six months and five years, or 15,000 km and 100,000 km.\n\nExhaust  emissions  regulations  continue  to  evolve  with  the application  of  Regulation  2023/443,  amending  Regulation 2017/1151,  which  introduces  three  new  intermediate  stages known as Euro 6e / Eu6bis / Eu6ebis FCM bringing corrections and  amendments  to  the  Euro  6d,  WLTP  3 rd act  and  RDE package 5 procedures.\n\nWithout  changing  the  Euro  6  limits,  these  new  stages introduce more stringent requirements between September  2023  and  January  2027,  including  a  significant reduction  in  the  measurement  uncertainties  of  PEMS (Portable Emissions Measurement System), an extension of the temperature conditions for RDE driving, the introduction of  an  indicator  tracking  the  use  of  an  auxiliary  strategy linked  to  emissions  and  a  reduction  in  the  CO2  emissions calculation factor for PHEVs, and a second stage reducing the CO2 emissions calculation factor for PHEVs.\n\nThe next major regulatory milestone is Euro 7. The European Commission  made  a  proposal  in  November  2022.  This proposal  is  currently  being  co-decided  by  the  European Parliament  and  the  European  Council,  with  convergence expected by the end of 2023. The aim is for Euro 7 to be the last step  before  zero  emissions.  This  regulation  will strengthen  the  limits  and  protocols  related  to  vehicle emissions  (exhaust  and  evaporation)  and  introduce  new requirements such as, for example:\n\n- \u25cf Limits  and  protocols  on  braking  and  abrasion  particles of tyres,\n- \u25cf Extended durability for battery emissions and performance\n- \u25cf Reinforcement  of  on-board  vehicle  monitoring  via  On Board  Monitoring  (OBM)  by  using  the  vehicle's  internal sensors  to  detect  over-emissions  and  NOx  and  particles and ammonia,\n- \u25cf Increased protection against 'fraudulent' handling (antitampering) of emissions-related functions,\n- \u25cf Creation of an environmental passport, etc.\n\nI\n\n01",

It  will  enable  the  authorities  to  check  that  the manufacturer's  CO2  declarations  comply  with  the  values measured on vehicles sampled in service. If a discrepancy is found, the manufacturer's CAFE score will be recalculated for all  years in which this family of vehicles has been marketed.

The  requirements  will  be  applicable  to  all newly  registered  vehicles  in  the  European  Union  from July 2024.\n\nTwo years after  these  dates,  new  requirements  for  the safety of pedestrians will apply to the front end of these vehicles,  in  order  to  extend  the  protection  zones  up  to the windscreen.\n\n## 1.5.1.3.2 Active safety\n\nAll  PCs  and  small  LCVs  (classes  M1  and  N1)  newly  typeapproved  since  July  2022  must  be  equipped  during manufacture with:\n\n- \u25cf an AEB (Advanced Emergency Braking) system to reduce the risk of collision with other vehicles, whether stationary or in motion;\n- \u25cf an  Emergency  Lane  Keeping  system  that  brings  vehicles back into their lane before an involuntary crossing (without indicator signals) of an unbroken line and alerts drivers in the event of an involuntary crossing of a broken line;\n- \u25cf an  Intelligent  Speed  Adaptation  system  capable  of alerting the driver when vehicle speed exceeds the limits;\n- \u25cf a  Driver  Drowsiness  &  Attention  Warning  system,  which should  be  based  on  analysis  of  activity  at  the  steering wheel, pedals, etc.\n\nThese  advanced  driver  aid  systems  (ADAS)  will  become obligatory from July 2024 for all newly registered vehicles in the European Union.\n\nTwo  years  after  these  dates,  new  ADAS  will  become mandatory  in  turn,  such  as  the  AEB  system,  which  takes pedestrians  and  cyclists  into  account,  and  the  Advanced Driver Distraction Warning system, which will require technologies that use cameras and image analysis algorithms.\n\nPassenger cars and commercial vehicles (LCVs and public transport  vehicles)  newly  type-approved  from  July  2022 onwards  must,  depending  on  the  category  of  PC,  public transport  vehicle, light commercial  vehicle  or  heavy commercial vehicle, be fitted with systems to detect and/or view pedestrians and cyclists in the vicinity of the vehicle at the front, side and rear of the vehicle.\n\nThese systems will become obligatory from July 2024 for all newly registered vehicles in the European Union.\n\n## 1.5.1.4 Cybersecurity\n\nRegulation  661/2009  also  introduced  vehicle  cybersecurity requirements  (all  categories)  through  the  adoption  of  the new  Geneva  regulation  that  codifies  this  area.  These requirements entered into force in July 2022 for newly typeapproved vehicles and will be applicable from July 2024 for all newly registered vehicles in the European Union.\n\nThese new provisions require manufacturers to put in place a  highly  structured  cybersecurity  governance  system  to ensure  that  all  decisions  and  approvals  are  traceable  and transparent to the supervisory authorities, and that all stateof-the-art technical  solutions  to  limit  cyber  risk  are incorporated  into  vehicle  design.  This  system  must  be accredited by a third party.\n\nUTAC and CNRV accredited Renault's governance system in early  2022.  Extensions  are  under  way,  with  the  addition  of new production sites in particular, and the accreditation of collaborative systems for partnerships.\n\nVarious countries,  such  as  Japan,  South  Korea,  Turkey  and Israel,  are  adopting  or  will  adopt  similar  requirements  with the same timelines.",

The amendment to the Vienna Convention on Road Traffic, which was adopted in 2020 and formalised in  2021,  thus  paves  the  way  for  developments  in  this direction in Germany, France and the UK.\n\nConnectivity is also a special case in that it involves a large number of players outside the automotive sector, which is a real  barrier  to  the  deployment  of  Intelligent  Transport Systems-type solutions.\n\nThe  European  Commission  is  currently  working  on  the introduction of electronic means for checking the condition of vehicles during Periodic Technical Inspections, which are easier to deploy and for which vehicle compatibility could be compulsory by the middle of the decade.\n\nLastly,  the  'connected  vehicle'  creates  a  major  challenge around data, and in particular 'access and transfer of data', whether  to  or  from  the  vehicle,  with  very  significant challenges in terms of monetisation and new 'businesses' in the background.\n\nThe purpose of the Data Act currently being drafted by the European  Commission  is  to  regulate  this  extremely promising data business, in which it is necessary to ensure, in  particular,  for  manufacturers,  that  the  balance  between free  competition  and  intellectual  property  is  maintained, under  the  arbitration  of  private  data  protection  laws (General Data Protection Regulation).\n\n## 1.5.1.6 Prohibited substances and materials and recycling\n\nThe  substances  regulation  governs  the  registration  of  all substances and materials present in vehicles and sets out prohibitions  and  limitations  of  these  substances  and materials,  with  monitoring  of  each  vehicle  to  avoid distribution  on  the  market  of  harmful  or  prohibited products  and  facilitate  recycling  of  end-of-life  vehicles and their batteries.\n\nthe company,\n\n| General presentation of   | Sustainable   | Corporate   | Risk and   | Financial   | the capital and the   | Annual general   | Additional   |\n|---------------------------|---------------|-------------|------------|-------------|-----------------------|------------------|--------------|\n| Renault Group             | development   | governance  | control    | statements  | share ownership       | meeting          | information  |\n\n## General presentation of Renault Group\n\nThe European Union provides most of the global regulatory guidance  on  substances  and  the  recycling  of  vehicles and batteries.\n\nThese include:\n\n- \u25cf European  REACH  (general  framework  applicable  to  all substances),  POPs  (persistent  organic  pollutants),  and biocidal products for substances regulations;\n- \u25cf the  F-GAS  regulation  on  greenhouse  gases  and  the  airconditioning systems directive;\n- \u25cf the  ELV  (End-of-Life  Vehicle)  and  recyclability  directives on  the  treatment  of  end-of-life  vehicles,  with  minimum recovery, recyclability and recovery quotas and bans on certain hazardous materials;\n- \u25cf regulations on the recyclability and durability of batteries.\n\nIt  should  be  noted  that  the  European  Commission's  Green Deal  objective  will  lead  to  a  number  of  changes  over  the next five to ten years that will affect vehicle design.\n\nThe  aim  of  the  regulations  is  to  increase  and  speed  up  the banning of  substances  that  have  a  negative  short-  or  longterm  effect on  the  environment  and  on  human  and  animal health in general. For example, the current ban on fluorinated substances  (PFAS)  should  be  implemented  swiftly  while allowing  a  limited  number  of  exemptions.  This  accelerated process,  applied  for  the  first  time  to  this  family  of  PFASs, should  rapidly  be  extended  to  phthalates  and  to  all substances and their families that are endocrine disruptors, persistent organic pollutants, and any substance that has a negative effect on the reproduction of living organisms (CMR substances), bioaccumulative and toxic substances, substances  that  develop  respiratory  or  skin  allergies,  or immunotoxic or neurotoxic substances.\n\nThe  European  Commission's  objective  is  to  encourage  the extension of any ban applied in the European Union to the rest  of  the  world,  where  permitted  by  an  international convention  under  the  UN  Environment  Programme.  This  is the case for persistent organic pollutants.\n\nFor batteries, the current regulations, which are restricted to recovery  criteria,  will  evolve  into  a  regulation  (EC  no.  2023/ 1542) covering their entire lifecycle.\n\nThis new regulation would introduce:\n\n- \u25cf technical requirements for performance, durability, carbon footprint, recyclability and introduction of recycled materials for construction with new batteries;\n- \u25cf industrial organisation requirements imposing the implementation of ethical rules throughout our supply chain (due diligence) periodically audited by the authorities;\n- \u25cf a  new regulatory framework to facilitate the second life of batteries, including in non-transport sectors;\n- \u25cf a  new  obligation  to  communicate  with  customers  via  a digital passport to summarise  the  technical and environmental performance of each battery.\n\nI\n\n01",

It also establishes thresholds that are not to be exceeded.\n\nIt also stipulates that certain industrial facilities are subject to administrative authorisation, which can only be granted if certain  environmental  conditions  are  met  (the  operator takes  appropriate  pollution  prevention  measures  and  the facility complies with at least the regulatory thresholds).\n\nOne of  the  guiding  principles  of  this  directive  is  the  use  of Best Available Techniques (BAT) to prevent pollution of any kind.  The  BATs  are  summarised  in  'BREFs'  (Best  Available Techniques Reference Documents), which set the levels of emissions  permitted  under  production  conditions  for  each sector of activity.\n\nMost  of  the  Group's  industrial  sites  depend  on  the  BREF  STS (surface  treatment  using  solvents)  for  automotive  paint activities, which has been revised and whose new conclusions were published on 9 December 2020 in EU Decision 2020/2009. After  submitting  the  review  application,  the  sites  concerned will  have  to  implement  the  BATs  required  to  comply  with  the\n\nnew thresholds by December 2024. In addition, revisions of the SF and  STM  BREFs,  concerning  foundries  and  surface treatment activities, also began in 2019 and 2022 respectively. Following the same logic as the BREF STS, these revisions will eventually set the future emission limits for these activities.\n\nThe  IED  Directive  also  requires  a  'baseline  report'  to  be drawn up describing the installations concerned, including soil  and groundwater diagnostics, before the installation is brought into service or before the first update of the permit issued.  Finally,  the  directive  redefines  the  obligation  to restore the site when the activity ceases.\n\n## 1.5.2.2 Air emissions management\n\nEuropean  Directive  (EU)  2015/2193  of  25  November  2015 , regulates emissions from medium-sised combustion plants. It sets  emissions  thresholds  for  sulphur  dioxide  (SO2), nitrogen  oxides  (NOx)  and  dust  into  the  atmosphere  from combustion plants with a rated thermal power greater than or equal to 1 MW and less than 50 MW, regardless of the type of  fuel  that  they  use.  It  also  establishes  rules  to  monitor carbon monoxide (CO) emissions.\n\nOperators must implement emissions monitoring in accordance with the requirements set out in Annex III to this directive  and  periodic  measurements  in  particular.  CO measurements are required for all facilities.\n\nEuropean Regulation (EU) No 517/2014 of 16 April 2014 (F-Gas) aims to contain, prevent and reduce emissions of fluorinated greenhouse gases covered by the Kyoto Protocol.\n\nThis regulation:\n\n- \u25cf discourages  the  use  of  fluorinated  gases  with  a  high impact  on  the  climate  and  encourages  energy  efficient and safe substitutes;\n- \u25cf continues  to  improve  the  containment  and  end-of-life treatment of products and equipment containing fluorinated gases;\n- \u25cf promotes  consensus  on  an  international  agreement under  the  Montreal  Protocol  to  gradually  reduce  HFCs, which are the main group of fluorinated gases;",

The implementation  of  the  fourth  phase  (2021-2030)  is  mainly governed  by  Implementing  Regulation  (EU)  2018/2066  on  the monitoring and reporting of greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nEvery  year,  sites  subject  to  the  scheme  must  declare  their greenhouse  gas  emissions  and  surrender  a  number  of 'allowances'  equivalent  to  the  tonnes  of  CO2  emitted. A certain number of allowances is allocated free of charge, and  additional  allowances  may  be  purchased  on  the primary or secondary markets.\n\nFor  the  fourth  phase,  the  allocation  of  free  allowances  is governed by strict rules,  specified  in  Delegated  Regulation (EU) 2019/331. Annual greenhouse gas emissions are verified by  an  independent  accredited  third  party  as  described  in Implementing Regulation (EU) 2018/2067.\n\nIn Korea, an exchange system was put in place in 2015, by a 2012 law (Act on Allocation and Trading of Greenhouse Gas Emissions Allowances) and an associated decree. The RKM sites in Busan and Giheung are subject to this.\n\n## 1.5.2.3 Water management\n\nRenault Group is subject to European regulations on the use and  protection  of  water,  as  it  withdraws,  uses  and discharges water during its production processes.\n\nEuropean  Directive  2000/60/EC  of  23  October  2000,  known as  the  'Water  Framework  Directive'  (WFD) defines  a framework for the management and protection of water by large  watershed  at  European  level.  It  plays  a  strategic  and founding role in water policy, setting ambitious objectives for the preservation and restoration of the condition of surface water (freshwater and coastal water) and for groundwater.\n\nPublic  authorities  are  also  imposing  strict  regulations  on industrial wastewater  that  may  be  discharged  into collection  systems  and  on  treated  wastewater  and  sludge from urban wastewater treatment plants.\n\nThe  WFD  set  targets  for  2025,  but  its  implementation timetable extends to 2027. Discussions are still underway on the issue of water, and on the reuse of domestic wastewater in particular. Better treatment of this water could\n\nthe company,\n\n| General presentation of   | Sustainable   | Corporate   | Risk and   | Financial   | the capital and the   | Annual general   | Additional   |\n|---------------------------|---------------|-------------|------------|-------------|-----------------------|------------------|--------------|\n| Renault Group             | development   | governance  | control    | statements  | share ownership       | meeting          | information  |\n\n## General presentation of Renault Group\n\nsignificantly increase the use of wastewater, especially for agricultural irrigation.\n\nEuropean Directive (EU) 2020/2184 of 16 December 2020 on the quality of water intended for human consumption aims to guarantee  high-quality  tap  water  throughout  the European Union. This directive follows the signing by more than  1.8  million  Europeans  of  the  first  ever  successful European citizens' initiative, 'Right2Water', which supports improved access to safe drinking water for all Europeans.\n\nIn  2022,  the  European  Commission  drew  up  a  watch  list  of substances  and  compounds  of  concern  (2)  for  water intended for human consumption in application of Directive (EU)  2020/2184  of  the  European  Parliament  and  of  the Council.  The  two  substances  concerned  are  endocrine disruptors  and  we  will  take  into  account  the  transposition texts  in  each  of  the  countries  in  which  Renault  Group operates  to  meet  these  new  requirements.  These  are  the responsibility  of,  among  other  things,  the  owners  of  the water distribution networks (companies).\n\nFinally, the increasing scarcity of water resources is a major challenge for the years to come.\n\n## 1.5.2.4 Waste management\n\nEuropean  Directive  2008/98/EC  of  19  November  2008, known as the 'Waste Framework Directive' (WFD), defines the  rules  applicable  to  the  treatment  of  waste  within  the European Union. It applies to all objects or substances that the holder discards or that he or she intends or is required to discard.  The  WFD  reaffirms,  in  the  name  of  the  'polluter pays'  principle,  the  responsibility  of  waste  producers  to manage  their  waste  in  such  a  way  as  not  to  endanger human health or harm the environment.\n\nThe  Directive  also  introduces  a  requirement  for  waste producers  to  limit  their  impact  on  the  use  of  resources  by preventing and reducing waste with a view to transitioning to a circular economy.\n\nIt  establishes  a  hierarchy  of  waste  treatment  methods, requiring  waste  producers  to  prevent  the  generation  of waste and then to treat it by maximising recovery (reuse and recycling in the first instance).\n\nIt  also  clarifies  the  concept  of  recovery,  disposal,  end  of waste status and by-products and requires the establishment  of  separate  collections  for  paper,  metal, plastic, and glass, as a minimum.\n\nThe  Basel  Convention  on  the  Control  of  Transboundary Movements of Wastes and their Disposal, which came into force  in  1992,  governs  and  limits  cross-border  shipments of waste.\n\nIt  calls  on  the  187  Parties  to  observe  fundamental  principles such as proximity to waste disposal, environmentally sound management, prioritise recovery, and prior informed consent to the importing of potentially hazardous substances.\n\nI\n\n01",

Among  other  things,  this  law  prohibits  agreements  that prevent, restrict or distort competition. By way of exception, agreements  limiting  competition  (in  particular  through selection  of  resellers  or  provision  for  exclusive  terms  for them)  are  authorised  when  they  may  contribute  to improving the production and distribution of products or to promote technical or economic progress.\n\nThe purpose of the European Commission's block exemption  regulations  2022/720  of  10  May  2022  and 461/2010  of  27  May  2010, applicable  respectively  to  the activities  of  distribution  of  new  vehicles  and  of  supply  of spare  parts  for  motor  vehicles,  repair  and  maintenance services  for  motor  vehicles,  is  to  exempt  from  the  ban  on cartels agreements  that are presumed  to improve distribution without eliminating competition.\n\nThe  criteria  for  this  automatic  exemption  depend  on  the market  shares  of  the  parties  to  an  agreement  (maximum threshold  of  30 %)  and  the  absence  of  any  marked restrictions  on  competition.  As  applied  to  the  automotive sector,  this  exemption  is  in  principle  applicable  to  the selection  by  manufacturers  of  their  network  of  authorised distributors and repairers.\n\nHowever,  the  presence  of  one  of  the  following  restrictions may prohibit the exemption from being applied:\n\n- \u25cf setting the price (fixed or minimum) at which distributors can  resell  vehicles  or  spare  parts  (prohibition  of  resale price maintenance);\n- \u25cf the  absolute  distribution  of  geographic  or  customer markets  between  authorised  distributors  (in  particular, the  restriction  of  passive  sales  in  a  reserved  territory  or group of customers);\n- \u25cf the ban on sourcing by authorised distributors from other authorised distributors (restriction of cross-deliveries);\n- \u25cf the ban on the resale by authorised distributors of spare parts  to  independent  repairers  for  use  in  repair  or maintenance services; and\n- \u25cf the ban on the use by authorised repairers of spare parts of  a  quality  equivalent  to  original  parts  for  repair  or maintenance services.\n\nSimilarly,  under  regulation  No.  461/2010,  any  restriction concerning  access  by  independent  repairers  to  the technical information necessary for the repair and maintenance of vehicles is presumed to exclude the benefit of exemption from the selection by Renault of its network of authorised repairers.\n\nSince  1  June  2023,  these  access  obligations  have  been extended  to  include  data  generated  by  vehicle  sensors: refusal of access may be justified on cyber security grounds.",

Some countries, such  as  Poland,  Spain  and  Germany  (since  1  January  2020), have adopted this clause. However, other countries such as France,  Slovakia  and  Croatia  refuse  this  deregulation  and therefore do not apply the repair clause principle.\n\nNevertheless, it is likely that the repair clause will eventually become applicable to all  countries  of  the  European  Union. In summer 2021, the European Commission launched a new\n\n## 1.5.5 Banking regulations\n\nSeveral  banking  sector  regulations  applicable  to  Renault Group through its subsidiary Mobilize Financial Services are likely to have a significant impact on its activities.\n\nDirective 2013/36 of 26 June 2013 on access to the activity of credit  institutions  and  the  prudential  supervision  of  credit institutions  and  investment  firms, known  as  the  CRD  IV Directive,  was  transposed into French law by Order 2014/158 and  the  Order  of  3  November  2014.  These  texts  have redefined  the  rules  governing  the  approval  conditions  for credit  institutions,  the  governance  of  credit  institutions, internal control and senior executive compensation, with the aim  of  harmonizing  the  regulations  applicable  to  credit institutions  in  these  areas  at  European  level.  They  are therefore an essential step towards the achievement of the internal  market  in  the  banking  sector.  Directive  2019/878 amended  Directive  2013/36  as  regards  exempted  entities, financial holding companies, mixed financial holding companies, compensation, supervisory measures and powers,  and  capital  conservation  measures.  This  directive was  transposed  into  French  law  by  Order  2020-1635  of 21 December 2020 containing various provisions for adapting legislation to European Union law in financial matters.\n\nEuropean Regulation 575/2013 of 26  June  2013  on  prudential requirements  for  credit  institutions  and  investment  firms, known as the CRR Regulation, introduced new requirements in  terms of capital ratios, liquidity ratios and leverage ratios. This  regulation  aims  to  strengthen  the  solidity  of  European banking  institutions by improving  the  qualitative  and quantitative  aspects  of  capital.  This  text  was  amended  by regulation  2019/630  as  regards  the  minimum  coverage  of losses on non-performing exposures. This new regulation also supplements the existing prudential rules as regards capital with provisions for a deduction from capital if non-performing exposures are not sufficiently covered by provisions or other adjustments. The CRR has also been amended by Regulation (EU) 2019/876 of 20 May 2019 as regards the leverage ratio, the\n\npublic consultation on the overall assessment of the design system, including questions relating to the repair clause.\n\nThe  extension  of  the  repair  clause  to  all  European  Union countries  would  have  a  significant  economic  impact  on Renault Group's after-sales market share.\n\nFrance has just taken a first step towards this liberalisation by passing a law that, starting on 1 January 2023:\n\n- \u25cf removes copyright protection for spare parts,\n- \u25cf reduces  the  duration  of  protection  of  spare  parts  by designs to 10 years (instead of 25 years),\n- \u25cf allows original equipment manufacturers to manufacture spare parts for replacement without the manufacturer's prior agreement.\n\nnet  stable  funding  ratio,  requirements  for  own  funds  and eligible liabilities, counterparty  credit  risk,  market  risk, exposures to central counterparties, exposures to collective investment  undertakings,  large  exposures,  reporting  and disclosure requirements, as well as Regulation (EU) 2020/873 of 24 June 2020 as regards certain adjustments to be made in response to the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nDirective 2014/59 of 15 May 2014 establishing a framework for the  recovery  and  resolution  of  credit  institutions  and investment firms , known as the BRRD, set out a framework for the  recovery  and  resolution  of  credit  institutions.  This  text aims  to  ensure  that  bankruptcies  of  European  banks  are managed in such a way as to preserve financial stability and minimise  costs  for  taxpayers.  It  gives  the  competent authorities  the  means  to  intervene  before  difficulties  arise and, where necessary, at the start of the resolution process. The  directive  came  into  force  on  1  January  2015.  These measures  were  supplemented  by  Regulation  806/2014  of 15 July 2014 establishing a Single Resolution Mechanism (SRM) and a Single Resolution Fund (SRF). Finally, this directive was amended by Directive 2019/879 of 20 May 2019, as regards the capacity to absorb losses and recapitalise credit institutions. In  particular,  this  directive  clarifies  the  setting  of  the  MREL (Minimum Requirements for own funds and Eligible Liabilities specific  to  each  establishment),  and  has  been  transposed into French law via Order 2020-1636 of 21 December 2020 on the resolution regime in the banking sector.\n\nDirective  2008/48  of  23  April  2008  on  consumer  credit agreements was  transposed  into  French  law  by  Law  2010737 of 1 July 2010 on consumer credit reform. The purpose of these texts is to provide better consumer protection and to harmonise  national  credit  distribution  rules.  These  texts require credit institutions to strengthen consumer information by providing them  with  a  standardised European pre-contractual information sheet. This Directive is currently being revised at European level.\n\nI\n\nthe company,\n\nthe capital and the\n\nshare ownership\n\nGeneral presentation of Renault Group\n\n01",

This text was  transposed  in  France  by  Government Order 2020-115 of 12 February 2021. This system:\n\n- \u25cf strengthens  the  transparency  of  complex  legal  entities and legal structures by broadening access to registers of beneficial owners;\n- \u25cf sets  out  the  enhanced  due  diligence  measures  to  be implemented  with  respect  to  business  relationships  or transactions involving high-risk third countries;\n- \u25cf specifies the safeguards to be put in place to mitigate the high risks of money laundering associated with entering into a business relationship remotely; and\n- \u25cf establishes  the  principle  of  consolidated  supervision  of AML-CFT procedures by banking and insurance groups.\n\nDirective 2016/97 of 20 January 2016 on insurance distribution, transposed into French law by Order 2018-361 of 16 May 2018, aims to ensure better consumer protection and harmonise  national  rules  on  the  distribution  of  insurance products. This text requires the establishment of governance  procedures  for  the  design  and  distribution  of insurance products and the delivery of a new standardised information document (IPID) to customers.\n\nOn  25  February  2019,  the  European  Banking  Authority published  Outsourcing  Guidelines (EBA/GL/2019/02).  These guidelines set forth a governance framework for outsourcing operations. Accordingly, they require an evaluation of each subcontractor, the keeping of a register of  services  outsourced,  and  the  inclusion  in  contracts  with subcontractors  of  a  certain  number  of  clauses  to  ensure good control of the risks associated with the outsourcing.\n\nn 18 January 2017, the European Banking Authority published guidelines  on  the  application  of  the  definition  of  default (EBA/GL/2016/07).  The  purpose  of  this  text  is  to  harmonise the definition of default by providing a detailed clarification of the various reasons for default (including the counting of days  in  arrears),  the  conditions  for  a  return  to  non-default and  the  associated  processes.  This  text  applies  from  1 January 2021.\n\nIn  addition,  the  European  Commission  adopted  Delegated Regulation  2018/171  entitled  'Final  report  on  materiality threshold for credit obligation past due' (RTS/2016/06). This text  introduces  a  single  methodology  for  the  counting  of days  in  arrears  (Day  past  due  counting)  based  on  the application of absolute and relative materiality thresholds.\n\nIn its Regulation 2018/1845 of 21 November 2018, the ECB set the absolute threshold at \u20ac100 for retail exposures and \u20ac500 for  other  exposures.  These  rules  must  be  complied  with from 31 December 2020.\n\nFinally,  the  European  Banking  Authority  also  published guidelines  for  estimates  of  probability  of  default  and estimates of loss given default (EBA-GL-2017-16). On  31  October  2018,  the  European  Banking  Authority  also published  guidance  setting  out  good  risk  management practices for credit institutions in relation to the management of non-performing exposures (NPEs), renegotiated  exposures  and  foreclosed  assets  (EBA/GL/ 2018/06), as well as guidance relating to institutions' internal governance  arrangements  and  procedures  in  relation  to credit granting processes, and associated risk management  procedures,  in  particular  the  assessment  of creditworthiness (EBA/GL/2020/06).\n\nThis guidance is part of wider work by the European Banking Authority  to  reduce  unwarranted  variability  in  internal model outputs, while preserving the risk sensitivity of capital requirements and loss given default estimates (EBA-GL- 2017-16).",

This  pillar  also  covers  the safety of employees in the workplace;\n- \u25cf The  third  pillar,  inclusion.

shed light on matters for the Board of Directors through its analyses and recommendations on environmental, social and societal issues.\n\nDialogue with stakeholders also helped to develop the

Spearheaded by the Sustainable Development Department, a Group-wide steering committee supervised the methodological approach and the key stages of the project. This  matrix  was  validated  in  January  2020  by  the  Group Executive  Committee  and  by  Jean-Dominique  Senard, Chairman of the Board of Directors.\n\n## Methodological approach\n\nThe  materiality  matrix  was  defined  by  management representatives  from  the  Company's  main  departments/ functions, based on internal and external data.\n\nThe  first stage  of the process  was  to  define  the comprehensive list of ESG issues facing Renault Group as a carmaker  and  supplier  of  mobility  services.  Numerous sources were consulted to prepare this list, particularly the ESG rating criteria, competitors' materiality matrices, press articles and interviews with experts.\n\nAll  of  the  issues  collected  were  grouped  into  14  coherent macro-issues. The importance of each issue along each axis of the matrix was then assessed.\n\nThe y-axis represents the influence on stakeholders' opinions or  behaviour  and  classifies  the  issues  according  to  the  ESG expectations of the Group's stakeholders. The importance of issues  along  this  axis  was  determined  from  interviews  with stakeholder representatives (employees, NGOs, suppliers, car dealerships, startups, researchers, public sector, investors) as well as a survey of 3,500 customers in seven countries.\n\nThe  x-axis  illustrates  the  impact  on  the  Company's sustainable performance and represents the contribution of each  theme  to  long-term  value  creation.  To  assess  the importance of each issue along this axis, internal interviews took place with the Group's Senior Management, employees in the main departments/functions and an internal survey of 200 of Renault Group's top managers.\n\nThe issues were then refined and placed on the materiality matrix  during  a  collaborative  workshop  bringing  together the  representatives  of  the  company's  main  business  lines/ functions.\n\nIn 2023, the Group conducted a new materiality analysis for the  publication  in  early  2025  of  a  version  with  double materiality  in  line  with  expectations  defined  by  Directive (EU) 2022/2464, known as the 'CSRD' (Corporate Sustainability  Reporting  Directive).  The  results  of  this analysis do not call into question the matrix set out below.",

The  complete  approach  and comprehensive information on risks in general are presented in chapter 4 of this Universal Registration Document.\n\n## 2.1.5.1 Extra-financial performance reporting methodology\n\n## Regulatory context\n\nIn accordance with Order No. 2017-1180 of 19 July 2017, and Decree No.  2017-1265  of  9  August  2017,  Renault  Group  has  established the Extra-Financial Performance Declaration (EFPD).\n\nIdentification of the main social, societal and environmental risks  of  the  Group  is  based  on  international  standards  and norms - such as the INERIS (French National Institute for the Industrial  Environment  and  Risks)  and  the  GRI  (Global Reporting  Initiative)  -  as  well  as  internal  mapping  (Group major  risks,  corruption  risks,  pursuant  to  the  provisions  of the French 'Sapin II' act, risks relating to the vigilance plan, as  well  as  issues  identified  in  the  materiality  matrix (see 2.1.4.2)).\n\n## Process of identification of the main extra-financial risks\n\nIdentification  and  summarising  of  the  principal  risks  with regard  to  the  expectations  of  the  EFPD  were  undertaken collaboratively,  under  the  supervision  of  the  Sustainable Development  Department  and  the  Risk  Management Department, with representatives of the various departments  and  managers  in  charge  of  subjects  coming within  the  scope  of  the  Extra-Financial  Performance Declaration, and notably:\n\n- \u25cf the environment;\n- \u25cf human resources;\n- \u25cf international social relations;\n- \u25cf purchasing and relationships with suppliers and subcontractors;\n- \u25cf health, safety, ergonomics and the environment (HSEE);\n- \u25cf IS/IT;\n- \u25cf road user safety;\n- \u25cf the development of new products and services;\n- \u25cf tax;\n- \u25cf legal affairs;\n- \u25cf ethics and compliance.\n\nRenault  Group  also  takes  into  account  the  United  Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) and market practices identified in its sector.\n\nThe  Company  has  also  taken  into  consideration  the information  listed  in  Article  L.  225-102-1  (III)  of  the  French Commercial Code. Certain topics have not been identified as  pertinent  principal  risks  in  respect  of  the  Group's activities  and  shareholders'  known  expectations,  notably those relating to food (food waste, fighting food insecurity, respect  for  animal  welfare  and  responsible,  fair  and sustainable food).\n\nThis list of risks was reviewed by the Strategy and Sustainable Development Committee of the Board of Directors.\n\n## Reporting principles\n\nThis work enabled identification of a list of 31 principal extrafinancial risks grouped within the following five areas:\n\n- \u25cf social;\n- \u25cf societal;\n- \u25cf environmental;\n- \u25cf human rights;\n- \u25cf the fight against corruption and tax evasion.\n\nPolicies,  procedures  and  the  results  of  these  procedures, including  performance  indicators,  have  been  established for each of these risks.\n\nThe  31  principal  risks  were  categorised  as  E  for  the  main Environmental  risks,  S  for  Social  and  Societal  and  G  for Governance  and  related  to  the  issues  in  the  materiality matrix (see table in 2.1.5.2 below).\n\n## Data collection process\n\nEach indicator is associated with a coordinator, generally a business-line  expert,  who  has  collected,  checked  and consolidated the data within the relevant reporting scope.\n\nThe  indicators  are  then  initially  validated  by  the  manager responsible for  producing  the  indicator  within  the  relevant activity,  then  validated  again  by  the  director  of  the  entity concerned.\n\nThe Sustainable Development Department consolidates all the data.",

This  verification  is  carried  out  with  an  equivalent  level  of assurance  to  the  financial  data  (reasonable  assurance within  the  meaning  of  the  IFAC's  ISAE  3000  for  extrafinancial verification). The  indicators  covered  by  the reasonable assurance report are listed in note 2.7.\n\nIn accordance with Order No. 2017-1180 of 19 July 2017, on the publication  of  extra-financial  information  by  certain  large companies and groups of companies, amended successively  by  Act  No.  2018-771  of  5  September  2018, Act No. 2018-898 of 23 October 2018, and Act No. 2018-938 of 30  October  2018,  Decree  No.  2017-1265  of  9  August  2017,  to implement  Order  No.  2017-1180  of  19  July  2017,  and  the decision  of  14  September  2018,  amending  the  decision  of 13 May 2013, the Group appointed an independent third party to  verify  the  compliance  of  the  EFPD  (Extra-Financial Performance  Declaration) and the accuracy  of the information contained therein. This information is included in the Renault S.A. management report.\n\nI\n\n02",

These  challenges  profoundly affect  all  economic  activities  and  notably  mobility.  RG's innovative  responses  to  stakeholders'  expectations  of  the transport sector are also potential drivers of competitiveness and economic opportunities.\n\nThe automotive industry needs to address major environmental issues:\n\n- \u25cf climate change related to greenhouse gas emissions, for which  the  Paris  COP  21  agreement  has  plotted  an ambitious reduction path;\n- \u25cf resources,  the  limited  availability  of  which  implies changing modes of production and use;\n- \u25cf Pollutant emissions, which are a health concern, particularly in cities;\n- \u25cf Ecosystem degradation and biodiversity erosion.\n\nTo  meet  these  challenges,  Renault  Group  has  had  an environmental  policy  since  the  late  1990s.  It  applies throughout the vehicle life cycle, from design to end of life, and  is  fully  in  line  with  the  company's  strategic  plan  (see graphic below).\n\nIn  addition,  Renault  Group's  environmental  commitment  is recognised by the CDP Climate score of A-.\n\n## RENAULT GROUP ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY\n\n## COMMITMENTS\n\n## CREATING VALUE\n\nContribute to the creation of new sources of income and profit through innovative mobility solutions and circular economy activities, contribute to the competitiveness and protection of tangible and intangible assets.\n\n## PREVENTING AND REDUCING\n\nPrevent and continuously reduce the environmental footprint of activities, services and products throughout their lifecycle.\n\nClimate change and energy efficiency\n\nResources and competitive circular economy\n\nBiodiversity and ecosystems\n\nHealth and substances\n\n## STEERING\n\nImplement environmental management across the Group and throughout the value chain in order to ensure continuous improvement and compliance with regulations and voluntary commitments.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## ENGAGING AND COMMUNICATING\n\nEnsure transparent and responsible communication and stakeholder dialogue.",

The strategy defines two major environmental priorities: reducing  greenhouse  gas  emissions  and  accelerating  the circular economy.\n\nThe  climate  strategy,  also  announced  at  the  2021  General Meeting,  provides  for  an  action  plan  up  to  2030  from upstream to downstream of the value chain, from the supply of  materials and components to the end of life of vehicles. As  vehicle  use  represents  more  than  80%  of  the  Group's carbon footprint, this phase of the product life cycle is the priority of the climate plan.\n\nFor  each area of action, the Group has defined monitoring indicators,  specific  targets  and  action  plans.  These  are detailed in chapter 2.2.2 of this Document.\n\nThe  Group  was  reorganised  in  2023  with  entities  each dedicated to an ESG challenge: Ampere for decarbonisation and the just transition to all-electric, Power for decarbonisation  through  alternative  fuels and  green hydrogen, The Future Is NEUTRAL for  conserving resources and creating short auto-to-auto loops.\n\nThe  transformation  of  the  Flins  plant  into  the ReFactory , Europe's first circular economy plant dedicated to mobility, is  emblematic  of  the  Group's  vision:  to  rely  on  a  complete recycling and remanufacturing industrial ecosystem that is both a response to the environmental challenge, particularly for the most strategic or critical materials, and an economic asset that generates revenues and profits.\n\nLastly, the Mobilize brand develops mobility, data and energy services and is another lever for the Group's transformation, creating environmental and societal value through its electric shared-mobility solutions and battery services.\n\n'The Group's environmental policy is a pillar of our engagement  and  responsible  capitalism  and  is  core  to  its transformation and its raison d'\u00eatre, which combine economic and  environmental  performance'  (Jean-Dominique  Senard, Chairman, and Luca de Meo, CEO, April 2021).\n\n## 2.2.1.2 Governance of environmental issues  EFPD7a\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nI\n\n02",

Each year, the Board examines issues related to climate change, Renault Group's strategy on greenhouse gas emissions, the electrification of its  product  range  and  the  impact  of  new  regulations  on greenhouse gas emissions and pollutants.\n\nIn  this  role,  the  Board  of  Directors  relies  on  the  work  of  the Strategy and Sustainable Development Committee, whose role  includes  reviewing  the  strategy  and  actions  to  be implemented  in  terms  of  the  company's  environmental, social and societal responsibility.\n\nThe  Strategy  and  Sustainable  Development  Committee  is composed  of  60%  independent  directors  in  accordance with the recommendations of the AFEP-MEDEF Code. It met four times in 2023, with a member attendance rate of 100%.\n\nIn  2023,  among  the  topics  examined  by  the  Strategy  and Sustainable Development Committee were:\n\n- \u25cf monitoring  of  the  implementation  of  the  Group's  social, societal and environmental responsibility strategy through a dashboard covering all ESG domains;\n- \u25cf the  Group's  strategy  for  sourcing  the  metals  and  rare earths needed to electrify its range;\n- \u25cf monitoring the partnership project to create a new joint venture, Flexis (logistics and carbon-free and connected);\n- \u25cf preparation for the arrival of the 'Euro7' standard, which defines  the  rules  for  reducing  pollutant  emissions  from road transport and minimum performance requirements for the durability of electric vehicle batteries;\n- \u25cf a focus on the 'Social' pillar of the Group's ESG strategy;\n- \u25cf the  Human  Resources  strategy  and  priorities  in  the implementation  of  the  'Renaulution'  plan  and  to  make Renault Group an industry benchmark in terms of human capital management;\n- \u25cf the impacts of the CSRD on ESG reporting obligations and monitoring  of  the  Group's  preparation  for  the  future implementation of this new regulation;\n- \u25cf the  strategy  and  development  of  the  circular  economy activity,  in  particular  through  the  implementation  of  the TFIN roadmap;\n- \u25cf monitoring  changes  in  the  electric  vehicle  market, competitive pressure and the Group's levers to respond to  them,  in  particular  with  the  creation  of  the  new Ampere entity;\n- \u25cf the  Group's  decarbonisation  strategy  and  that  of  the Ampere entity, taken separately;\n- \u25cf the strategic roadmap of Mobilize Financial Services (MFS), the  financial  arm  of  the  Renault  Group  brands,  which  will develop a complete range of increasingly innovative and digital services to accelerate the transition to new greener mobility  and  meet  new  usage-based  automotive mobility needs ('vehicle-as-a-service');\n- \u25cf the  report  on  gender  equality  and  the  rollout  of  the Group's diversity objectives.\n\nFor more  details on the Strategy and Sustainable Development Committee's activities,  see  Chapter  3.1.6.3  of the 2023 Universal Registration Document.\n\n## Management of climate objectives by the Leadership Team and the Strategy and Business Development Department (DSBD)\n\nThe  Leadership  Team  and  the  DSBD  steer  the  Group's environmental objectives. The focuses of the environmental policy are discussed once a year and arbitrated within the Leadership Team on the proposal of the Director of Strategy and Business Development. The Leadership Team relies on the Group Sustainable Development Committee. The areas of authority of the members of this Committee, particularly in sustainable development, are detailed in section 3.1.3.\n\nThe  Strategy  and  Business  Development  Department  is responsible  for  preparing,  deploying  and  monitoring  the implementation of the environmental policy in all sectors of the company throughout its value chain and for each stage in  the  life  cycle  of  its  vehicles.  To  this  end,  it  relies  on  a network  of  correspondents  deployed  in  all  the  company's functions, as well as on the areas of expertise. The areas of expertise  were  created  in  2010  within  the  Group  in  areas such as 'energy, environment and raw materials strategy', 'vehicle CO2' and 'air quality and substances'. The experts who  make  up  these  teams  provide  in-depth  knowledge  of strategic issues and an approach recognised internally for its  rigour,  neutrality  and  cross-disciplinary  nature.  Since 2020, a full-time position has been dedicated to managing the Climate Plan (see 2.2.2.1).\n\nThe rollout of the environmental component of the strategic plan by the Strategy and Business Development Department thus covers all of Renault Group's activities and supports its development of new products and services.\n\n## Compensation tied to meeting environmental targets\n\nGiven  the  importance  of  climate  issues  for  the  Group,  the compensation of the senior executive includes, since 2013, a criterion related to respect for the environment and aimed at 'leadership in environmental performance'. More recently,  on  the  recommendation  of  the  Governance  and Compensation Committee, the Board of Directors proposed a change to the compensation policy for the Chief Executive Officer by adding criteria related to:\n\n- \u25cf meeting  the  European  regulatory  target  for  passenger car CO2 emissions (CAFE standards);\n- \u25cf reducing the carbon footprint of Renault Group passenger and commercial vehicles registered worldwide;\n- \u25cf reducing  the  number  of  kg  of  CO2  emitted  per  vehicle produced in Europe;\n- \u25cf the  number  of  used  vehicles  reconditioned  at  the 'ReFactory' in Flins;\n- \u25cf the achievement  of  a  percentage  of  the  Group's electrified  passenger  cars  in  Europe  as  a  proportion  of total Group vehicle sales.",

Since 2004, Renault Group has been measuring  the  environmental  impact  of  its  vehicles throughout  their  life  cycle,  from  the  extraction  of  the  raw materials needed to manufacture them to their end of life. Life Cycle Assessments (LCA) are therefore performed:\n\n- \u25cf prior  to  the  vehicle  design  process,  to  analyse  the potential environmental impact and benefits of technological innovations;\n- \u25cf after  the  design  process,  to  confirm  and  measure  the reduction of environmental impacts from one generation of vehicles to another.\n\nAt  end-2023,  24  models  representing  80%  of  the  Group's global passenger car sales under the Renault, Dacia, Alpine and  RKM  (Renault  Korea  Motors)  brands  were  thus subjected  to  a  complete  LCA.  Starting  with  the  launch  of Twingo III in September 2014, all new models are subjected\n\nto  a  comparative  LCA  with  respect  to  their  predecessor. Each  of  these  LCAs  is  subjected  to  a  critical  review  by  an independent  expert  following  ISO  14040  and  ISO  14044  to evaluate, firstly, the methodology used and, secondly, all of the  calculations  and  interpretations  performed.  The  LCA reports for new models, together with their critical reviews, are available on request.\n\nFor further methodological details, please refer to section 2.6.1.2.\n\nThe graph below presents the results of the comparative life cycle  analysis  of  the  1 st generation  ICE  Captur,  the 2 nd generation  ICE  Captur  and  the  Captur  Plug-in  Hybrid 'E-Tech',  in  the  form  of  a  norming  comparison.  Norming consists of measuring the relative weight of the impacts of the vehicles studied in relation to the global environmental impacts in a reference year, relative to a person.\n\n## The LCA results illustrate the relevance of the Plug-in hybrid vehicle in terms of the fight against global warming\n\nOver  the  entire  life  cycle,  the  reduction  in  greenhouse  gas emissions  is  32%  for  Captur  E-Tech  compared  with  2 nd gen. Captur, taking into account an average European electricity mix for  battery  charging.  With  the  electricity  mix  in  France,  the reduction was 53%. The influence of the electricity mix used for charging on the final result is  also  notable  for  the  acidification potential  indicator,  with  a  reduction  of  34%  for  Captur  E-Tech charged with the French electricity mix, compared with Captur E-Tech charged with the average European mix.\n\nI\n\n02",

Environmental  management  at  Renault  Group plants is underpinned by four pillars:\n\n## 1. Continuous improvement based on ISO 14001\n\nStarting in 1995, Renault began systematically implementing an environmental management approach at its sites, along with  a  drive  for  continuous  improvement,  based  on ISO  14001.  This  was  done  to  reduce  environmental  impact and ensure regulatory compliance. Since 2008, all of Renault Group's industrial sites and the nine main engineering and logistics facilities have been ISO 14001-certified.\n\n## 2. Group-wide tools and standards\n\nIn order to control these main environmental risks, as required by the French vigilance law, Renault Group has developed a tool called 'Mandatory Rules Environment'. This assessment tool makes it possible to identify and prioritise environmental risks (see 2.5.4.1, Environmental risk mapping).\n\nIn  order  to  ensure  that  practices  are  consistent,  exemplary and coherent with the company's environmental policy and objectives, particularly in countries with restrictive regulatory frameworks,  industry  standards  covering  all  areas  of  the environment define minimum requirements (see the paragraph  'Ecodesign  of  industrial  processes'  below).  The MRE tool highlights the key points of these standards.\n\nFor  environmental  management  and  the  handling  of chemicals,  the  sites  can  also  rely  on  the  availability  of standardised  tools  managed  by  expert  functions.  These tools include:\n\n- \u25cf a reporting system for environmental impacts and energy consumption (R2E);\n- \u25cf a  CHEMIS  (Chemical  Information  System)  database, available in the main languages used within the Group, for the  management  of  hazardous  substances  and  the prevention of chemical risks (see 2.2.2.3.2);\n- \u25cf a process to monitor and track compliance with national and EU environmental legislation;\n- \u25cf a  documentary  database  of  environmental  standards and best practices.\n\n## 3. Ecodesign of industrial processes\n\nRenault  Group's  industrial  projects  are  designed  according to a  development  strategy  punctuated  by  milestones. At  these  milestones,  each  business  line  checks  that  the project complies  with  the  defined  rules  and  verifies convergence  with  the  other  business  lines.  The  HSEE Department is part of this Group approach.\n\nWith  regard  to  the  environment,  the  project  must  be designed  in  such  a  way  that  the  site  hosting  it  is  able  to comply with the mandatory rules described in the MRE.\n\nFor example, pursuant to the 'Soil' Environmental Mandatory Rule, six diagnostic analyses of the environmental  quality  of  soils  and  groundwater  were conducted  in  2023.  The  purpose  of  these  diagnostic analyses is to define, upstream of the works phase, the most appropriate waste treatment channel for excavated earth to be evacuated off-site.\n\nTo complement this shared base of minimum requirements applicable  to  all  Group  projects,  technological  innovations may be introduced according to constraints or opportunities related to the local environment. For example, a  new  innovative  technology,  called  'Over  Spray  Free',  is under development and will be implemented by 2024 at the Maubeuge  plant.  This  technique  for  applying  paint  to  the roof of a vehicle, when a colour contrasting with the rest of the vehicle is wanted, is similar to inkjet printing. With a yield of  100%,  it  eliminates  paint  overspray  losses,  which  are around  30%  with  current  techniques.  It  will  no  longer  be necessary to mask the parts of the vehicle that are not to be painted, also reducing the waste of masking tape. It will be rolled out to other plants if the results are conclusive.\n\n## 4. Environmental management system audits\n\nThe Group uses internal audits at all of its industrial facilities as  well  as  its  main  engineering  and  logistics  facilities  in order to monitor the implementation of ISO 14001 requirements and  compliance  with  its own  internal standards  for  the  protection  of  the  environment.  These complement  the  external  audits  performed  annually  by  a certified independent body.\n\nThese internal audits are therefore conducted by members of the  environmental  network  using  joint  audits  that encourage exchanges of best practice between plants and stimulate improvements in environmental performance.\n\nAs of end-2023, the network had 50 internal environmental auditors  who  were  specifically  trained  and  qualified  in accordance  with  ISO  14001  and  knowledge  of  the  various environmental  topics.  Each  new  auditor  embarks  on  a progressive skills development  path  until eventually becoming an audit manager.",

The  governance  of  climate  issues takes place within the framework of the governance of all environmental issues.\n\n## 2.2.2.1.2 Action plan EFPD11c  EFPD12b  EFPD12c\n\nIn  2019,  Renault  Group  was  the  first  carmaker  to  have decarbonisation  targets  validated  with  the  Science-Based Targets (SBTi) initiative.\n\nIn  April  2021,  Renault  Group  published  its  Climate  Plan.  It  is broken down into nine major actions over the entire life cycle of vehicles, described below. They will be gradually rolled out across the Group until 2030, an interim milestone towards our ambition  of  carbon  neutrality 5 in Europe  by  2040  and worldwide by 2050. In addition to the nine actions, the Group has tools and processes to manage risks and opportunities.\n\n## 2.2.2.1.2.1 Actions on the vehicle usage phase Scope 3 Downstream\n\nIn  2023,  the  vehicle  usage  phase  accounts  for  more  than 85% of Renault Group's carbon footprint 6 .\n\n## Action #1:\n\nElectrify 100% of new Renault brand models by 2030 in Europe\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAn internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicle in Europe emits 3 times more CO2 in its life cycle than an electric vehicle 7 .\n\nEU  Member  States  must  implement  national  energy  and climate  plans  (NECP)  guaranteeing  their  contribution  to achieving the EU's climate and energy goals. As part of this effort, they are phasing out the sale of ICE vehicles in 2035 at the  latest.  Furthermore,  the  UN  predicts  that  two  thirds  of the world's population will be urban by 2050, and cities are already increasingly restricting access for ICE cars.\n\nIn  order  to  achieve  its target of  electrifying  100%  of  new models of Renault passenger cars in Europe, the company is:\n\n- \u25cf Pooling  production  across  four  platforms: CMF-B  and CMF-CD for ICE vehicles. AmpR Small and AmpR Medium for electric vehicles (2 new reference platforms).\n- \u25cf Developed the  'ElectriCity' in  northern  France,  which  is the largest and  most  competitive  electric  vehicle production centre in Europe.\n- \u25cf Launching 5 new Renault brand electric models by  2025. After  two  electric  models  launched  in  2022  (Megane E-Tech Electric and Kangoo EV), it was the turn of Renault Scenic,  which  embodies  the  new  generation  of  Renault electric vehicles, to be unveiled in 2023.\n- \u25cf Accelerating  electrification by  shortening  the  time  to develop a new vehicle by 25%.\n\nTo support this acceleration, Mobilize, the brand dedicated to  new  mobility  and  services  around  vehicles,  is  also developing  solutions  to  facilitate  the  adoption  of  electric vehicles. For example, Mobilize offers:\n\n- \u25cf Mobilize  Smart  Charge:  optimise  charging  costs  and reduce carbon footprints.\n- \u25cf Mobilize  Charge  Pass:  a  single  card  for  recharging  at nearly than 600,000 charging points in Europe.\n\nIn  addition,  Mobilize  Power  Solutions,  a  Renault  Group subsidiary  specialising  in  customised  recharging  solutions for  electric  and  plug-in  hybrid  vehicles,  is  simplifying  the transition to electric mobility for professionals and individuals.  Today,  Mobilize  Power  Solutions  is  present  in 11  key  European  electric  mobility  markets:  Spain,  Portugal, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, Switzerland, Austria, Belgium, the Netherlands, Italy and Luxembourg.\n\nFrom advice to installation to the operation and maintenance of charging stations, Mobilize Power Solutions supports its customers for their recharging needs at work, at home, and on the move. The creation of a network of ultrafast  charging  stations,  Mobilize  Fast  Charge,  close  to motorways and major roads, and in partnership with dealers in the Renault network, is also planned. The first stations will open in 2024.\n\n- 5 Carbon neutrality: balance between residual emissions after RG's GHG emissions reduction plan for scopes 1, 2 and 3 (see 2.2.2.1.2) and investments in projects to create carbon sinks (see 2.2.2.1.2.4).\n- 6 Use, fuels and electricity required for use.

Ampere  develops,  manufactures  and  sell  fully  electric  passenger  cars  with  advanced  SDV  (Software  Defined  Vehicle) technology under the Renault brand. Ampere will bring the best of both worlds: the know-how and assets of Renault Group with the focus and agility of a pure player in electric vehicles. Ampere was created with the aim of achieving parity in sales prices between Renault Group's internal combustion engine vehicles and its electric vehicles before the competition. (see section 1.2.2).\n\n## Action #2:\n\n## Become a European leader in hydrogen-powered light commercial vehicles by 2025\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRenault,  one  of  the  European  leaders  in  light  commercial vehicles, offers electric versions for all its models. Today, the aim  is  to  improve  performance  in  terms  of  range  and charging speed for heavy-duty use.\n\nTo  extend  the  range  of  the  electric  vehicle  without increasing  the  size  of  the  battery,  or  even  by  reducing  it, hydrogen  fuel  cell  technology  (Dual  Power)  provides additional zero-emission energy. In addition to charging at electric stations, vehicles can be charged with hydrogen in just a few minutes.\n\nIn  2021,  Renault  and  Plug  Power  launched  a  joint  venture called Hyvia to offer a global hydrogen solution providing:\n\n- \u25cf Commercial  vehicles  with  a  range  of  400  kilometres (WLTP  standard)  and  reduced  charging  time  (less  than 5 minutes).\n- \u25cf Complete  turnkey  solutions  for  these  fuel  cell  vehicles: charging  stations,  supply  of  green  hydrogen  from decarbonised energy.\n\nHyvia  has  set  a  target  of  achieving  a  30%  share  of  the European  hydrogen  LCV  market  by  2030.  Among  its  first customers:  Chronopost,  Engie,  Orange,  Equans,  Alpine  F1 Team  (in  France),  Airbus,  Port  de  Hambourg,  Packeta  and Maximator Hydrogen GmbH (in Germany).\n\nThrough  Hyvia,  Renault  Group  plans  to  continue  building strong  partnerships  in  the  field  of  hydrogen,  for  example with FOVIA on the development of hydrogen tanks for light commercial vehicles. In addition, on the basis of collaborative projects, Renault Group will develop solutions integrating all  public  and  private  players  in  the  production and distribution of energy.\n\nIn  2023,  Hyvia  announced  a  partnership  with  Atawey,  a leading  player  in  hydrogen  charging  stations,  to  create  a new  offering:  HYWELL\u2122.  In  addition  to  mobility,  Hyvia  will offer  fuel  cell  solutions,  manufactured  in  Flins,  France,  to other industries.\n\n## Action #3: Deploy hybrid technologies on the Renault and Dacia brands\n\nRenault  Group  is  developing  low-emission  engines  (E-Tech hybrid and gas) to complement its offer of electric vehicles.\n\nDeveloped  exclusively  by  the  Renault  brand,  the  E-Tech hybrid technology reduces the fuel consumption of a hybrid engine  by  40%  compared  with  an  equivalent  internal combustion engine in urban cycle. Its E-Tech plug-in hybrid version delivers a zero-emission mobility solution. Acceleration of the hybrid E-Tech offering:\n\n- \u25cf Target: 35% Renault hybrid vehicle sales in 2025 8 .\n- \u25cf After the launch of Renault Austral in 2022 (E-Tech hybrid), New Renault Espace was launched in 2023. It is fitted with a  motorised  drive.  200-horsepower  ultra-efficient  full hybrid E-Tech (4.6 litres/100km).\n\nAt the same time, in 2023, Dacia launched the Dacia Jogger HYBRID 140 and presented the new Dacia Duster, the same powertrain.\n\nLastly,  the  Group  is  deploying  new  technologies  to  further reduce  hybrid  vehicle  emissions:  connectivity,  eco-driving and  a  100%  electronic  mode  to  enable  access  to  lowemission zones.\n\n## Additional action:\n\nIntroduce eco-driving aids\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nUnder  favourable  driving  and  temperature  conditions,  a driver with an economical driving style (an 'eco' driver) can achieve the same fuel consumption as a WLTP cycle, which is  up  to  25%  less  than  an  'average'  driver.  A  'dynamic' customer can consume up to 40% more than the 'average' driver and 70% more than an 'eco' driver 9 .\n\nTo  help  its  customers  reduce  their  fuel  or  electricity consumption in real driving conditions, and thus reduce GHG emissions  in  use,  Renault  Group  has  been  offering  ecodriving  assistance  systems  since  2012.  These  fall  into  two categories:  delegative  and  constructive,  adapted  to  the main driver profiles.",

With this knowledge, some users  are  seeking  to  reduce  the  overall  cost  of  their travel and turning to new mobility solutions.\n\nAmong these, shared mobility makes it possible to optimise the  use  of  the  car  and  to  pay  only  for  the  kilometres travelled.  This  also  reduces  the  number  of  vehicles  on  the road and therefore reduces their environmental impact.\n\nMobilize was created in particular to meet these challenges: to  move  from  the  model  based  on  ownership  to  a  model based  on  use  with  100%  electric  vehicles,  designed  for  a specific use. Based on Mobilize Financial Services and built around open ecosystems (startups, etc.), Mobilize promotes a sustainable energy transition and new types of mobility.\n\nThe brand offers a wide range of services around the vehicle (VaaS, Vehicle as a Service): financing, insurance, payments, fleet management,  vehicles available by subscription in a vehicle & package & associated services, mobility  solutions,  energy  solutions,  maintenance  and reconditioning.  These  services,  combined  in  a  single  offer, meet the needs of individuals, fleets and mobility operators.\n\nI\n\n02",

By  2026, performance  classes  will  be  introduced,  and  in  2028, maximum carbon footprint thresholds will be defined.\n\nRenault  Group  intends  to  accelerate  the  deployment  of more efficient, low-carbon, reusable batteries by acting on their entire life cycle:\n\n- \u25cf Low-carbon  battery  production: in association  with suppliers, reduce the carbon  footprint of battery production by using decarbonised energy and materials. Renault Group aims to reduce the carbon footprint of the new  R5's  battery  produced  in  France  by  20%  by  2025 compared with the Zoe battery in  2019.  The  reduction  is expected to reach 35% in 2030. In this respect, since 2021,\n\nRenault  Group  has  signed  three  agreements  with material  suppliers:  with  Terrafame  for  a  sustainable nickel  supply  (low  carbon  and  traceability  of  the  entire supply  chain)  with  Vulcan  for  less  carbon-intensive lithium and  with  Managem  for  low-carbon  cobalt sulphate  produced  in  Morocco.  This  is  in  addition  to  the agreements  with  Verkor  and  Envision-AESC  to  produce the batteries in France from 2025.\n\n- \u25cf Maintenance: deployment  of  battery  repair  centres during their first life (around a hundred operate as of the end  of  2023,  including  a  centre  of  expertise  and  repair within  the  Flins  Reactory).  Existence  of  an  offering  of second-hand batteries for the repair of electric vehicles.\n- \u25cf Second life: development of mobile solutions and stationary storage of renewable energy. These second-life uses of our batteries help to avoid GHG emissions associated with the production of new batteries for these uses.\n- -Betteries: Assembly  by  GAIA  at  the  Flins  ReFactory  of modular  storage  systems  produced  as  part  of  the partnership  between  Renault  Group  with  the  startup Betteries,  which specialises in the recovery and use of batteries from electric vehicles. Betteries uses recycled EV batteries to develop transportable electric generators  suitable  for  a  variety  of  purposes  (e.g.  on construction sites or in food trucks);\n- -Advanced  Battery  Storage: energy  storage  systems, made  up  of  second-life  batteries  and  new  batteries awaiting future automotive use, to store intermittently produced low-carbon electricity and replenish the grid during peak load periods.\n- \u25cf Recycling: closed-loop  recycling  of  strategic  materials (cobalt,  nickel,  lithium)  to  produce  new  batteries.  To  do this,  Renault  Group  relies  on  its  entity  The  Future  Is NEUTRAL,  which  develops  strategic  partnerships  to recycle these battery materials in a closed loop. In 2030, Renault  Group  plans  to  recycle  80%  of  these  three materials from end-of-life batteries to manufacture new batteries (closed loop).\n\nMaintenance,  repair  and  second-life  activities  are  carried out at the Refactory in Flins, France (see box in section 2.2.2.2).\n\nIn addition to these activities, starting from the launch of the R5  model  in  2024,  vehicle-to-grid  (V2G)  technology  will enable electric vehicles to feed energy into the power grid to regulate peak consumption.\n\n## Renault Group within collaborative platforms\n\nSince  2021,  the  Group  has  been  actively  contributing  to  the  methodological  work  on  calculating  the  carbon  footprint  of  batteries  as  a member of  the  Global  Battery  Alliance  (GBA)  and  Recharge.  In  particular,  this  work  led  to  the  publication  of  a  methodology  commonly accepted by the international members of the GBA: the GHG Rulebook.

The  mapping  of direct  purchases  has  been  performed  through  the accredited external body CDP Supply Chain and will serve as  a  basis  for  extending  supplier  involvement.    In  2023, Renault  Group  received  an  'A'  rating  on  the  CDP Commitment Leaderboard criterion.\n- \u25cf Area 2: The Green Procurement and CSR guidelines have been  updated  to  make  suppliers  responsible  for  CSR commitment  criteria  and  the  assessment  of  their performance by an external body (see 2.5.5).\n- \u25cf Area 3: In addition to the battery, the six commodities with the highest carbon emissions have been identified (steel, aluminium,  polymers,  tyres,  electronic  components  and glazing). A specific procedure has been put in place to ask suppliers  to  report  emissions  and  develop  associated reduction proposals for new projects, particularly for steel and aluminium.\n- \u25cf Area  4: Co-innovation  partnerships  are  supported  by various collaborative projects to demonstrate  the efficiency of decarbonisation of technologies compatible with  future  regulations  and  consumer  expectations.  The Ultra  Green  project  (which  aims  to  reduce  CO2e  by  90% compared with a standard vehicle) is a concrete example of this.\n- \u25cf Area  5: Increase  local  sourcing  for  production  plants.

At  end2023, the certified sites are Bursa, Cl\u00e9on, Le Mans, Sandouville, Novo Mesto, Douai, Maubeuge and Ruitz.\n\n## Energy management within Renault Group\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn  2023, the energy consumption reduction actions at all of the  Group's plants saved approximately \u20ac23 million on the annual energy bill 10 .\n\nThe energy savings and controlled performance approach covers industrial, tertiary, logistics and distribution sites. For example,  the  installation  of  solar  panels  on  the  roof  of  a dealership in Switzerland 11 prevents the emission of almost 50,000  metric  tons  of  CO2e  per  year.  Energy  efficiency equipment (switching to LEDs, presence detectors, switching off heating in the evenings and during weekends) has  been  installed  at  several  branches.  By  way  of illustration, at a French branch 12 ,  the  energy gains between 2022 and 2023 total 28%.\n\nI\n\n02",

The sites are continuing their overall compaction trajectory with a target of reducing 750,000 m\u00b2 of  buildings  covered  by  2025.  In  particular,  in  2023,  the reduction  of  63,000  m\u00b2  at  the  Douai  site,  13,000  m\u00b2  at  the Tangier site and 7,500 m\u00b2 at the Revoz site.\n\n## 2. Manufacturing processes:\n\nDevelopment of more energy-efficient processes, optimisation  of  existing  processes  and  implementation  of energy recovery systems.\n\n## 3. Energy management 4.0:\n\nTools for  analysing  and  managing consumption data, with the use since 2022 of an EcoGy energy portal connected to a network of more than 10,000 sensors and meters enabling\n\nreal-time monitoring of electricity, gas and compressed air consumption at all our sites.\n\nThis  infrastructure,  supported  by  an  'Energy  Crisis'  Task Force,  made  it  possible  to  reduce  energy  consumption  by 15% between 2021 and 2022 and by 6% in 2022 and 2021. In terms of energy consumption per vehicle produced, Renault Group's  target  is  a  30%  reduction  by  2025  compared  with 2021 and even a 40% reduction in the French plants.\n\n## 4. Renewable electricity:\n\nTarget  set  in  2021  to  reach  100%  of  our  sites  powered  by renewable energy in France, Spain, Slovenia and Portugal by 2030. The progress is detailed in the box below and in 2.2.2.1.3.\n\nRenault  Group  thus  aims  to  remain,  at  least  until  2030, among  the  world's  top  3  manufacturers  in  terms  of  the lowest greenhouse gas emissions at its industrial sites.\n\n2030 is also the target date for achieving carbon neutrality at all European sites (2025 for sites and activities related to the production of electric vehicles at ElectriCity, France).\n\n## Renault Group is accelerating the decarbonisation plan for its plants and innovating with partners\n\n- \u25cf Brazil. In  2023,  Renault  Group  signed  a  contract  with  supplier  Cormec  Ernegia  to  cover  85%  of  the  Curitiba  plant's  electricity  needs generated by photovoltaic panels.\n- \u25cf Spain. In 2021, Renault Group signed a contract with the energy supplier Iberdrola to cover 100% of its energy consumption in Spain with renewable energy.\n- \u25cf France. In November 2022, the Group announced three major partnerships with energy players:\n- -with Voltalia, the largest renewable electricity supply contract in France. This contract will enable Renault Group to cover up to 50% of the electricity consumption of its production activities in France in 2027 through the installation of photovoltaic panel farms;\n- -with the ENGIE Group, a first-of-its-kind deep geothermal project in Europe that would replace 70% of the gas needs of the Douai factory by 2026;\n- -with Dalkia, EDF Group, a partnership aimed at connecting the Maubeuge site to a district heating network to replace 30% of this site's gas consumption.\n\n## Action #9:\n\n## Reduce emissions from the transportation of parts and vehicles by 30% between 2019 and 2030\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nToday, the objective of the supply chain is to work to further reduce  the  carbon  footprint  of  transportation,  logistics platforms and its packaging.\n\n2018-2021  track  record:  the  Group  reduced  its  freight/ logistics CO2e emissions by 6.69%, with a target of -5.5%.\n\n2019-2030 action plan built on four pillars across the logistics chain:\n\n- \u25cf Deploying biogas and biofuel trucks starting in 2021, and continued  in  2023,  followed  by  electric  and  hydrogenpowered trucks starting in 2026.\n- -biogas: 897  metric  tons  of  CO2e  have  already  been avoided in inbound logistics thanks to the implementation of 8,302 GAS trucks (bio-CNG and CNG) with three carriers in France.\n\n- -biofuel: Maubeuge/Douai  local flows have been decarbonised  with  the  introduction  of  7,078  B100  and HVO100 trucks since July 2023 (552 metric tons of CO2e emissions  avoided).  On  the  vehicle  distribution  side, 19,819  new  vehicles  were  transported  with  3,492  B30 trucks  from  the  carrier  Dolotrans,  for  a  reduction  of 1,620  metric  tons  of  CO2e  on  a  France-Romania  flow, import and export.\n- \u25cf Scaling up multimodal transportation , in part by increasing the share of rail freight.\n- -upstream logistics :  new trains have been implemented from  Romania,  Serbia  and  Spain,  Germany  to  France, for 2,093 metric tons of CO2e avoided.\n- -vehicle  distribution: the  introduction  of  trains  has enabled 4,445 metric tons of CO2e to be saved on flows from the Shiyan factory (China) to the port of Shanghai for  19,674  vehicles,  as  well  as  on  a  Spain/Austria  flow with 5,135 vehicles. In 2023, four new rail flows were put in place, departing from Batilly, Koper and Douai, trains were doubled, and some saw their capacity increased: all  these  new  actions  will  enable  us  to  reduce  our emissions by 2,093 metric tons.",

Densification actions for parts and packaging have made it possible to avoid  the  equivalent  of  8,093  trucks,  for  a  reduction  of 4,136 metric tons of CO2e.\n- \u25cf Rational management of packaging :  reducing its weight, returning  used  packaging,  minimising  waste,  increasing the share of recycled material in packaging and eventual elimination of single-use plastics.\n\n## Together, these actions have allowed more than 270,000  metric  tons  of  CO2e  emissions  to  be  avoided (cumulative over the period 2019-2023).\n\nBeyond the 2021-2030 action plan, Renault Group expects to further avoid  emissions  through  the  development  of packaging  recycling  channels,  both  within  the  Group  and with its suppliers.\n\nIn addition, Renault Group entered into a partnership in 2018 with  NEOLINE,  a  French  startup  developing  wind-powered cargo  ships.  Pilot  vessels  are  planned  for  2025,  and  other flows are under consideration.\n\n## 2.2.2.1.2.3 Tools and processes in place to manage risks and opportunities\n\n## Monitor the reduction of CO2e emissions from vehicles: CAFE Control Tower\n\nIn 2018, Renault Group created a specific programme team called  the  CAFE  Control  Tower  to  monitor  the  results  in Europe and oversee the roadmap each year.\n\nStarting in 2019, the Group also developed a tool to forecast CO2  levels  for  its  registered  vehicles  in  Europe.  The  CAFE Control Tower  reports its results to the Board of Management (BoM) every month.\n\nOutside Europe, the Group is subject to regulatory standards similar to those in Europe. In total, around 70% of the Group's sales worldwide are thus subject to CAFE-type regulations.\n\nThe strategy and organisation described above enabled the Group  to  achieve  its  CAFE  Europe  targets  for  passenger cars and light commercial vehicles in 2023 13 .\n\nIn  addition,  vehicle  CO2e  emissions  are  closely  monitored through  the  global  carbon  footprint  KPI,  and  specific product  competitiveness  targets  are  set  in  terms  of  fuel consumption  and  CO2e  emissions.  The  BoM  reviews  these indicators  each  year  to  ensure  their  alignment  with  short-, medium- and long-term strategy.\n\n## Making strategic choices to manage GHG emissions reduction: Internal Carbon Pricing\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Group uses an Internal Carbon Pricing (ICP) mechanism to  drive  the  reduction  in  its  CO2e  emissions  and  internalise the economic cost of its greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nThese internal prices apply to several types of decisions:\n\n- \u25cf For  industrial  facilities, the  ICP  takes  into  account changes  in  the  energy  market  and  in  CO2e  emission allowances.  More  than  half  of  the  Group's  direct emissions  are  subject  to  the European  Union  Emissions Trading Scheme (EU-ETS) .\n- \u25cf For new vehicle projects , two areas of application:\n- -Decisions concerning the technological building blocks that  improve  the  efficiency  of  vehicles  in  use.  The definition of the ICP integrates, in particular, regulations on  in-use  emissions  such  as  CAFE  (i.e.  \u20ac95  g  CO2 penalties in Europe); and taxation linked to CO2;\n- -Decisions on vehicle materials and  components throughout the value chain. The definition incorporates regulations  such  as  the  ETS  and  the  CBAM  in  Europe (Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism).\n\nThese various ICPs are revised at least once a year and vary between  \u20ac100/t  CO2e  and  \u20ac200  t/CO2e  to  take  account  of market developments and regional specificities.\n\n## 2.2.2.1.2.4 Offsetting\n\nRenault  Group  will  invest  in  carbon  offsetting  for  residual emissions, with priority given to reducing emissions.\n\nCarbon  offsetting: voluntary purchase  of  credits  on  the carbon market certified according to international standards  (Gold  Standard,  Verra  (VCS)  or  even  the  France low-carbon label).\n\nThe  projects  will  be  of  several  types:  creation  of  renewable energy  production  capacity,  forest  maintenance,  creation  of forests  and/or  mangroves  and  agro-ecological  projects. Renault Group will aim to support projects that have a positive impact  on  several  Sustainable  Development  Objectives  (e.g. climate, biodiversity, poverty, human rights, etc.).\n\nThe first  implementation  of  offsetting  for  Renault  Group  is planned  for  2025,  as  part  of  ElectriCity's  carbon  neutrality programme.\n\nI\n\n02",

The changes with the greatest impact on the total result relate to the use phase. The driving assumption has been increased from 150,000 km to 200,000 km. In addition, a corrective factor has been introduced to reflect the differences between type approval and actual driving conditions: in the new calculation method,  the  approved  values  of  CO2  emissions  and  electrical  consumption  of  vehicles  are  thus  increased  by  20%.  As  the  Group's decarbonisation targets for 2025 and 2030 are based on 2019, Renault Group's total carbon footprint for 2019 has also been recalculated using the new methodology.\n\n## Scope 1 and 2 Greenhouse Gas Protocol\n\n| Indicators and targets                                                         | Starting point   | 2025 Interim target   | 2030 target         | Status at year-end 2023   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|-----------------------|---------------------|---------------------------|\n| Reduce carbon intensity (1)  at Renault Group sites                            | 2019             | -50% (2)              | -80% (2)            | -32%(\u221a)                   |\n| (CO2e/vehicle produced)                                                        | 2021             | -30% World            |                     | -21% World(\u221a)             |\n| Reduce energy intensity at Group sites (MWh/vehicle produced)                  |                  | -40% France           |                     | -22% France(\u221a)            |\n| Increase the share of renewable energy in electricity  consumed at Group sites | -                | -                     | 80%                 | 53%                       |\n| Increase the proportion of renewable energy in the heat supply  at Group sites | -                | -                     | 70%                 | 4%                        |\n| Achieve carbon neutrality of sites  (3)                                        | -                | ElectriCity sites     | All sites in Europe | 2025 target               |\n\n- (1) Direct and indirect emissions of sites divided by the total number of vehicles produced (see scope 1 and scope 2 categories in the Renault Group carbon footprint categories table in 2.6.1..2.B).\n- (2) 2025 target in absolute value: Scopes 1+2 carbon footprint below 572,000 metric tons of CO2e; 2030 target in absolute value: Scopes 1+2 carbon footprint below 230,000 metric tons of CO2e.\n- (3) Residual emissions will be offset, see 2.2.2.1.2.4.\n- (\u221a) Indicators audited by the independent third party at a reasonable level of assurance for the 2023 financial year.\n\n## Carbon Footprint Scope 3\n\n| Indicators and targets   |                                                                | Starting point   | 2025 Interim target   | 2030 target         | Status at year-end 2023   |\n|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|-----------------------|---------------------|---------------------------|\n| Well-to-wheel emissions  | Reduce CO2e emissions  per vehicle worldwide                   | 2019             | -20%                  | -35%                | -15 %                     |\n| Parts and materials      | Reduce CO2e/kg of materials                                    | 2019             | -                     | -30%                | N/R, under construction   |\n| Batteries                | Reduce CO2e emissions from battery  manufacturing              | Zoe 2019         | -20% New R5           | -35% All new models | 2025 target               |\n| Logistics                | Reduce well-to-wheel CO2e emissions  from logistics activities | 2019             | -                     | -30% per vehicle    | +27%  (1)                 |\n\n- (1) Airline breakdowns related to the crisis in electronic components and new Asia-Europe flows.

In Europe, the CAFE emissions target of 95 g CO2/km in 2020 was adjusted in 2021 to apply the WLTP standard. In the event of non-compliance, a penalty payment of \u20ac95 per  excess gram per vehicle sold is due. Based on current sales volumes, each excess gram of  CO2/km would incur a penalty of approximately \u20ac120 million. Regulatory changes may also  introduce traffic bans or restrictions for certain vehicles.

For example, the tools  used  to  assess  climate  risk  impacts  on  performance are also employed to conduct an overall analysis of Renault Group's risks.\n\nThe following table is a simplified illustration of an analysis of the climate risk impacts on each business criterion, based on the following scenario.\n\n|                                                 | 1.5 \u00b0C scenario R&D,      | 1.5 \u00b0C scenario R&D,   | 1.5 \u00b0C scenario R&D,   | 3 \u00b0C scenario             | 3 \u00b0C scenario   | 4 \u00b0C scenario              | 4 \u00b0C scenario   | 4 \u00b0C scenario   | 4 \u00b0C scenario                                       |    |\n|-------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|---------------------------|-----------------|----------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------|----|\n| Risks and opportunities                         | Market size and structure | Turnover               | Other costs (Capex,    | Market size and structure | Cost of sales   | financing, labo u r, etc.) | Turnover        | Cost of sales   | Other costs (Capex, R&D, financing, labo u r, etc.) |    |\n| Transition risks and opportunities              |                           |                        |                        |                           |                 |                            |                 |                 |                                                     |    |\n| Changes to regulations                          |                           |                        |                        |                           |                 |                            |                 |                 |                                                     |    |\n| Technology changes                              |                           |                        |                        |                           |                 |                            |                 |                 |                                                     |    |\n| Market changes                                  |                           |                        |                        |                           |                 |                            |                 |                 |                                                     |    |\n| Reputational risks and opportunities            |                           |                        |                        |                           |                 |                            |                 |                 |                                                     |    |\n| Workforce changes                               |                           |                        |                        |                           |                 |                            |                 |                 |                                                     |    |\n| Physical risks and opportunities                |                           |                        |                        |                           |                 |                            |                 |                 |                                                     |    |\n| Extreme weather events / Natural disasters      |                           |                        |                        |                           |                 |                            |                 |                 |                                                     |    |\n| Resource scarcity                               |                           |                        |                        |                           |                 |                            |                 |                 |                                                     |    |\n| Structural geographic and geopolitical  changes |                           |                        |                        |                           |                 |                            |                 |                 |                                                     |    |\n| Spread of diseases                              |                           |                        |                        |                           |                 |                            |                 |                 |                                                     |    |\n\nRenault Group's strategy for dealing with the risks and opportunities associated with climate change is detailed in section 2.2.2.1.2.  In  addition,  a  comprehensive study of the vulnerability of our industrial sites to climate scenarios was carried out in 2022 and will lead to the implementation of action plans drawn up in 2023 for deployment between 2024 and 2025 (see details in chapter 4.2.1)\n\n## 2.2.2.1.4.5 How Renault Group identifies climate risks\n\nA  working  group  met  in  2020  to  respond  to  the  TCFD's recommendations. Its members represent the various Group departments  with  strategic  added  value  for  the  climate project: they include the Head of Risk Management, the Head of  Financial  Communications, the Sustainable Development Department  and  several  technical  experts.  The  'Climate' working Group identified the risks related to climate change (including  transition  and  physical  risks),  built  scenarios, assessed  the  impacts  of  each  risk  on  Group  performance under each scenario and developed action plans.\n\nStarting  in  2015,  work  on  a  materiality  matrix  had  made  it possible to identify 'material' issues, i.e. those that will have a major impact on the Group's ecosystem and its performance, on which it will therefore have to focus its efforts. This matrix was updated in 2020 (see section 2.1.4.2). 'Reducing the total carbon footprint' is a top priority for Renault Group. Internal and  external  stakeholders  expect  the  Group  to  continue  its efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nI\n\n02",

In  section  4.2.1, transition risks and physical risks are summarised, and their management systems are described.\n\n## 2.2.2.2 Resources and the circular economy  EFPD9  EFPD10  EFPD11b\n\n## 2.2.2.2.1 Governance of resource and circular economy issues\n\nRefer  to  section  2.2.1.2.  The  governance  of  resource  and  circular  economy  issues  takes  place  within  the  framework  of  the governance of all environmental issues.\n\n## The Future Is NEUTRAL\n\nCreated in  October  2022  by  Renault  Group,  The  Future  Is  NEUTRAL  is  the  first  company  to  operate  across  the  entire  automotive  circular economy value chain, with the aim of providing the tools to enable the automotive industry to move towards resource neutrality.\n\nBringing together the expertise and numerous industrial and technological assets related to the circular economy existing within the Group and with its partners, The Future Is NEUTRAL offers solutions at every stage of a vehicle's life: supply of recycled raw materials in a closed loop from automobile to automobile for production of vehicles, distribution of refurbished or remanufactured parts during the use phase and management of the end of life of vehicles.\n\nTo develop its activities, The Future Is NEUTRAL relies on numerous technical skills, positioned at the heart of its business model, to optimise the  economic  and  environmental  performance  of  its  solutions  (advanced  engineering,  chemistry  and  data  exploitation).  The  Future  Is NEUTRAL also offers the automotive industry a consultancy service offer, as well as training courses dedicated to the circular economy. This offer is being developed with the support of the Circular Mobility Industry (ICM) campus based in Flins, as part of the Group's ReKnow University corporate university.\n\n## Some key figures\n\n|                                                                                     |                                                                                     | 2023           | Scope                                                               |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Average composition  of Renault Group  vehicles                                     | Metals                                                                              | 70%            | Average material composition of vehicles produced in Europe, Turkey |\n| Average composition  of Renault Group  vehicles                                     | Plastics                                                                            | 15%            | and North Africa                                                    |\n| Average composition  of Renault Group  vehicles                                     | Glass                                                                               | 3%             | Average material composition of vehicles produced in Europe, Turkey |\n| Average composition  of Renault Group  vehicles                                     | Other materials                                                                     | 12%            | Average material composition of vehicles produced in Europe, Turkey |\n| Estimated material  consumption for                                                 | Steel (in thousands of metric tons)                                                 | 2,535,kt       | Global                                                              |\n| Estimated material  consumption for                                                 | Cast iron (in thousands of metric tons)                                             | 179 kt         | Global                                                              |\n| Renault Group  production in                                                        | Aluminium (in thousands of metric tons)                                             | 276 kt         | Global                                                              |\n| one year  (2.2 million vehicles)                                                    | Plastics (in thousands of metric tons)                                              | 307 kt         | Global                                                              |\n| Estimated  percentage of  recycled materials  (for plastics) or  materials from the | Proportion of scraps in recycled flat steels  in the Blast Furnaces sector          | 17%            | Europe and Maghreb plants (around 2/3 of World volumes)             |\n| Estimated  percentage of  recycled materials  (for plastics) or  materials from the | Proportion of scraps in long steels                                                 | more than 90%  | Europe and Maghreb plants (around 2/3 of World volumes)             |\n| circular economy                                                                    | Proportion of scraps in cast iron                                                   | more than 90%  | The Group's in-house foundry in Europe (LeMans)                     |\n| (scraps for metals) (1)                                                             | Proportion of scraps in aluminium - secondary aluminium  smelters                   | 98%            | In-house foundries in Europe (Cl\u00e9on, Valladolid and Pitesti)        |\n| Estimated  percentage of  recycled materials  (for plastics) or  materials from the | Proportion of scraps in flat aluminium - aluminium parts  stamped in-house          | 40% on average | Douai plants and soon Palencia in 2024                              |\n| Estimated  percentage of  recycled materials  (for plastics) or  materials from the | Average mass of recycled plastic used per vehicle                                   | 19 kg          | Vehicles produced in Europe, Turkey and North Africa                |\n| Estimated  percentage of  recycled materials  (for plastics) or  materials from the | Average mass of recycled plastic per new vehicle, put into  production in year-2023 | 25 kg          | Vehicles produced in Europe, Turkey and North Africa                |",

The  upward  trend  in  raw  material prices  and  their  volatility  are  having  an  impact  on  the company's profitability.\n\nReducing the consumption of virgin materials is therefore a major ecological and economic issue.\n\nThe  principles  of  the  circular  economy  make  it  possible  to reduce  exposure  to  risks  associated  with  virgin  raw materials through:\n\n- \u25cf ecodesign standards applied to vehicles and batteries to make more frugal use of rare materials, increase the use of recycled materials, and anticipate the dismantling and recycling of vehicles at the end of their life;\n- \u25cf projects  aimed  at  developing  and  implementing  new technical solutions and industrial sectors for the collection,  reuse,  renovation  and  recycling  of  parts  and materials to expand the range of reused or remanufactured  parts,  increase  second-life  uses  and recycling  of  electric  vehicle  batteries  or  develop  short material recycling loops within the automotive sector;\n- \u25cf plans to improve the efficiency of industrial processes to optimise resource use and minimise recover waste.\n\nRenault Group  also strives to adopt a responsible purchasing  approach,  the  first  step  of  which  is  to  map human  and  environmental  risks  (see  2.5.5  Supplier  and subcontractor vigilance plan).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nI\n\n02",

This project is part of the Group's transformation and builds on its pioneering commitment to the circular economy. It aims to develop a competitive industrial model for sustainable mobility, based on the value-creation potential generated by a vehicle throughout its life. The rollout of new activities started in 2021.\n\nThe ReFactory relies on a large network of multi-sector partners (startups, academic partners, major groups, local authorities, etc.) and is structured around four areas of activity.\n\nRe-trofit: This division combines all the activities making it possible to extend the life of vehicles and their uses, in coordination with the ReCycle division, to ensure efficient management of the flow of used parts and materials within the company on a single site. It includes the reconditioning of second-hand vehicles (The renew factory) and the repair of severely damaged vehicles (The bodywork factory).\n\nAn activity to convert thermal utility vehicles (Renault Master) to electric vehicles is also planned. Announced in July 2022, the partnership between Renault Group and Tolv (formerly Phoenix Mobility) is the first collaboration between a non-specialised carmaker and a startup in the retrofit sector. The partnership is a proof-of-concept project with the aim of launching a future commercial offering.\n\nRe-energy: The  aim  of  this  division  is  to  scale  up  innovative  applications  using  electric  vehicle  batteries  and  new  low-carbon  energies: assessment and repair of electric vehicle batteries, dismantling of end-of-life batteries and reuse of their components (collaboration with the startup Betteries to assemble portable electric generators from second-life battery modules), development of second-life applications such as stationary electric energy storage, industrialisation of hydrogen fuel cells and charging infrastructure for low-carbon vehicles.\n\nRe-cycle: This  division,  which  includes the remanufacturing workshops transferred from the Choisy-le-Roi site, brings together a range of activities that contribute to the efficient management of materials through the reuse and renovation of automotive components and will eventually house a line for dismantling end-of-life vehicles.\n\nRe-start: To promote and develop industrial know-how, but also to accelerate research and innovation in the circular economy, this division houses an incubator as well as a specific training centre. It also includes an advanced manufacturing activity with renovation services for industrial robots and production of parts from 3D printers.\n\n## 2.2.2.2.3.1 Designing vehicles that are recyclable and material-efficient\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n95%  of  the  vehicle  mass  is  recyclable  or  recoverable:  this European  regulatory  requirement  is  applied  to  all  Group vehicles sold worldwide.\n\nThe design of Renault vehicles incorporates the constraints related  to  dismantling  and  recycling,  for  example  by reducing  the  number  of  attachments.  Similarly,  we  give preference  to  materials  that  can  be  recycled  through existing  channels,  and  we  avoid  combining  materials  that\n\ncannot be recycled together. During the design phase, every new vehicle project is monitored by a recycling specialist.\n\nRenault Group also participates in research projects aimed at  developing  new  recycled  and  recyclable  materials (Cf. example of the DECORE Project, in paragraph 2.2.2.2.3.6 'Recycling').\n\nThe possibility of renovating powertrains or certain of their parts  (remanufacturing)  is  also  taken  into  consideration from  the  beginning  of  their  design  by  facilitating  the dismantling and diagnostic assessment of their components.\n\nLastly,  Renault  Group  is  working  to  reduce  the  amount  of materials used in manufacturing its vehicles.\n\n## Reducing our dependence on rare earths\n\nWhenever possible, the Group has opted for electric motors without permanent magnets containing rare earths. Since 2011, the company has chosen to use externally excited synchronous motors, a rare earth-free technology, for its 100% electric vehicles.\n\nIn addition, when feasible, the Group chooses materials other than rare earths in its magnets, for example, ferrite for applications such as speakers.\n\nRenault Group is also reducing the use of the most critical rare earths through technological innovations. Our consumption of dysprosium (a heavy rare earth) in magnets has thus decreased by 65% since 2011, thanks to substitution with light rare earths (a little less critical). Lastly, Renault is working on rare earth recycling projects, which would make it possible to meet part of the need and thus reduce our dependence and the associated impacts.",

For example, the use of durable packaging for  the  transport  of  manufacturing  parts  may  be favoured over single-use packaging.\n- -When the production of  waste  cannot  be  avoided,  we seek  to  reduce  the  amount  by  separating  the  portion that  is  not  waste,  strictly  speaking.  Several  solutions exist,  such  as  dehydration  of  sludge  from  the  painting process  and  water  treatment  plants  or  separation  of reusable oils from sludge and machining chips.\n- \u25cf Reuse used products, offcuts and production scraps:\n- -In  assembly  plants,  excess  anti-corrosion  protection waxes  are  recovered  after  application,  filtered  and returned to the production system.\n- -Following  the  implementation  of  regeneration  of solvents used to rinse the painting robots on most sites, the  reuse  of  these  regenerated  solvents  in  the  paint lines  is  now  in  place  at  the  Batilly,  Maubeuge,  Flins, Sandouville  (France)  and  Valladolid  (Spain)  sites.  In Colombia,  the  Envigado  plant  has  been  recycling  its paint  solvents  internally  since  2014,  enabling  the  plant to eliminate almost all solvent waste.\n- -As for the mechanical component production sites, the Cl\u00e9on  plant  collects  and  regenerates  used  stamping oils  and hydraulic oils from the Flins plant for use in its own  machining  processes  for  mechanical  parts, replacing new oils.\n- -When in good condition, some packaging (e.g. wooden pallets or thermoformed plastic trays) is reused within the company or resold for the same purpose.\n- \u25cf Recycle the  materials  contained  in  the  waste.  This treatment  method  is  applicable  to  most  non-hazardous waste  (cardboard/paper,  plastics,  metals,  wood  and glass).    Scrap  metal,  which  represents  over  70% 20 of  the total  production  waste,  is  almost  completely  recycled. Paper,  cardboard  and  plastics  are  also  systematically sorted for recycling.\n- \u25cf Recover energetically:\n- -by  using  waste  as  an  alternative  fuel:  as  an  example, the site at Flins, since 2017, has been sending part of its hazardous  waste  to  a  facility  for  the  preparation  of substitute solid fuel (SSF) supplied to cement works as an alternative to fuel oil for the combustion units;\n- -Or  by  recovering  energy  from  its  incineration  to produce electricity or steam; this in turn can be used to replace natural gas for heating paint drying ovens, as is the  case  at  the  Sandouville  plant  in  France  and  the Busan plant in South Korea;\n- \u25cf Dispose by  burning  waste  (without  energy  recovery)  in incineration  facilities  or  burying  it  in  landfills.  Renault Group  is  seeking  to  minimise  the  use  of  this  waste management  method.  Renault  Group  reduced  the quantities of manufacturing waste sent to landfill (except demolition  waste  and  foundries)  by  73%  between  2013 and 2023 17 .\n\n## Waste by category and treatment method (metric tons/year) (\u221a) (1)\n\n|                                     |      | Total   | Recycled   | Energy recovery   | Incinerated without energy recovery   | Other elimination channels   |\n|-------------------------------------|------|---------|------------|-------------------|---------------------------------------|------------------------------|\n| Hazardous waste                     | 2023 | 47,273  | 20,285     | 13,508            | 9,012                                 | 4,469                        |\n|                                     | 2022 | 41,976  | 18,006     | 13,525            | 6,667                                 | 3,778                        |\n|                                     | 2021 | 44,406  | 17,348     | 14,284            | 7,212                                 | 5,561                        |\n| Non-hazardous industrial waste  (2) | 2023 | 139,204 | 120,258    | 13,079            | 976                                   | 4,891                        |\n|                                     | 2022 | 137,456 | 116,895    | 13,704            | 1,311                                 | 5,546                        |\n|                                     | 2021 | 132,336 | 110,489    | 13,156            | 903                                   | 7,787                        |\n| Scrap metal                         | 2023 | 469,239 | 469,159    | 9                 | 0                                     | 71                           |\n|                                     | 2022 | 436,544 | 434,252    | 0                 | 20                                    | 2,292                        |\n|                                     | 2021 | 441,757 | 439,872    | 0                 | 0                                     | 1,886                        |\n|                                     | 2023 | 655,716 | 609,702    | 26,595            | 9,988                                 | 9,430                        |\n| TOTAL                               | 2022 | 615,976 | 569,154    | 27,228            | 7,978                                 | 11,616                       |\n|                                     | 2021 | 618,499 | 567,709    | 27,440            | 8,116                                 | 15,234                       |\n\nI\n\n02",

Quantities of construction waste unrelated to the activity do not appear on the graph. (\u221a) Indicators audited by the independent third party at a reasonable level of assurance for the 2023 financial year.\n\nBetween 2022 and 2023, the overall amount of waste per vehicle produced remained relatively stable. The slight increase (+2%) is mainly due to the increase in scrap metal (which is 100% recycled).\n\n## 2.2.2.2.3.3 Collect, sort, dismantle, direct\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCollection is an essential step in the recycling of end-oflife products.\n\nIn 2022, Renault created The Future Is NEUTRAL, which aims to bring together all the existing expertise of the Group and its partners  in  this  activity.  This  new  entity  offers  short-loop recycling solutions at every stage of a vehicle's life: supply of parts and raw materials, production, use and end of life, with the ambition of taking recycling into a new era and becoming the European leader in the automotive circular economy.\n\nThe Future Is NEUTRAL relies on its subsidiary GAIA, whose activities in battery repair, collection and reuse of parts, and recycling  of  materials  from  end-of-life  vehicles  (ELV)  are based in Flins, but also on BOONE COMENOR, experts in the recycling of metal scraps from the industry.\n\nLastly, since 2008, together with its key partner Suez, Renault has  held  a  50%  stake  in  INDRA,  the  leading  ELV  processing company in France, adding to its range of expertise.\n\nINDRA has been active in automotive dismantling for nearly 40 years and is now fully aligned with this new era, working at all levels of the chain, through four complementary areas of activity:\n\n- \u25cf engineering:  INDRA  designs,  develops,  produces  and markets  innovative  tools,  equipment  and  processes (refined  and  tested  at  their  own  dismantling  site  in Pruniers-en-Sologne) that deal with ELV decontamination, dismantling  and  recycling.  These  tools  and  methods  are intended  to  be  widely  disseminated  throughout  the network  of  ELV  Centres  in  the  INDRA  network,  as  well  as internationally.  INDRA  develops  and  delivers  training programmes  specifically  for  deconstruction,  including through its AURECA Training Centre set up in 2021 (nearly 1,200 people trained in 2023);\n- \u25cf management/distribution  of  end-of-life vehicles for carmakers, insurers, governments and individuals through its 350 ELV centres;\n- \u25cf dismantling/recycling in its own dismantling centres;\n- \u25cf sale of refurbished parts under warranty: INDRA distributes certified, reusable parts dismantled at its sites through its network.\n\nBased on the data available at the time of publication, the number of end-of-life vehicles processed in 2023 in INDRA's network of approved ELV centres or at its own dismantling sites is estimated at around 300,000.",

To develop Europe's first  short-loop  battery  recycling  offer, the  entity  relies  on  the  largest  fleet  of  electric  vehicles and  high-content  chemistry  and  capitalises  on  INDRA's network  of  electric  vehicle  experts  to  help  with  battery recycling and GAIA's expertise for their diagnostics.\n\n## 2.2.2.2.3.4 Reuse and give a second life\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe subsidiary GAIA collects unused parts at the plants, at suppliers' facilities and in the sales network, sorts them and, depending  on  their  condition,  directs  them  to  reuse, remanufacturing  or,  failing  that,  to  the  most  appropriate recycling system.\n\nIn  France,  Renault  has  offered  reuse  body  parts  (including hoods,  wings  and  headlamp  units)  collected  and  selected from INDRA's network of dismantlers since 2012.\n\nTo  facilitate  access  to  these  reuse  parts,  INDRA  has developed  the  PRECIS  system,  commissioned  in  France  in 2014, in partnership with Sidexa. It provides repairers with a pooled  stock  of  600,000  reuse  bodywork  and  mechanical parts  of  all makes,  qualified  and  available  at  over 140 approved end-of-life vehicle centres in its network.\n\nRenault Group and INDRA  have  strengthened  their partnership  since  2022  in  order  to  facilitate  the  use  of  the PRECIS tool and develop the use of reuse parts by repairers.\n\nThis offer allows the restoration of vehicles at a lower cost, including  those  for  which  repair  would  not  have  otherwise been  economically  viable  using  new  parts  alone,  thus extending  the  vehicle  life  while  very  significantly  reducing the environmental footprint associated with the repairs.\n\nLastly, Renault Group also gives a second life to the batteries of  its  electric  vehicles,  which  can  be  reused  at  the  end  of\n\ntheir first life on the vehicle and before they are recycled: the subsidiary  Mobilize  develops  and  implements  with  its partners numerous non-automotive energy storage applications (see section 1.2.2).\n\n## 2.2.2.2.3.5 Remanufacture, recondition and repair\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRenault is committed to a circular economy approach, with expertise in remanufacturing parts for more than 70 years. Used  parts  of  our  vehicles  are  collected  from  the  sales network, sorted and refurbished. Since 2022, these activities have been integrated into the Flins ReFactory, and some are entrusted  to  selected  external  suppliers.  They  adhere  to  a strict  industrial  process:  involving  complete  dismantling, cleaning,  sorting,  refurbishment  and  replacement  of  faulty or worn parts, reassembly and inspection. Parts that cannot be  reused  are  recycled,  some  in  a  closed  loop  at  Renault Group foundries.\n\n' Standard Exchange '  remanufactured parts are offered at a lower price than the new part while maintaining the same quality  requirements. The offer covers engines, gearboxes, turbos,  clutches,  starters,  transmissions,  engine  flywheels, alternators,  compressors,  steering,  etc.  In  2023,  it  was extended  to  new  families  of  electric  vehicle  components (power electronics and steering systems).\n\nRenault  also  offers  repair  and  reconditioning  services  for certain parts. They are diagnosed, repaired or reconditioned in the workshop or in dedicated expert centres, then tested to ensure that they are in good working order in compliance with  Renault  Group  quality  standards.  These  repair  offers concern  traction batteries for electric vehicles and electronic parts (for infotainment systems, engine computers, dashboards, screens, electronic units, etc.).\n\nRenault  Group  continues  to  innovate  and  broaden  its offerings  in  line  with  the  circular  economy,  drawing  on  its long-standing in-house expertise and developing partnerships with external refurbishers, particularly for the latest vehicle technologies.\n\nIn 2023, Renault Group signed an agreement with Black-Star to  distribute  Leonard  tyres  (80%  recycled  contents)  within the Renault Group After-Sales network.\n\n## 2.2.2.2.3.6 Recycling: develop new recycling routes, use recycled contents\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAs  part  of  the  'short  loops'  approach  to  the  circular economy, Renault Group's objective, through its subsidiary TFIN,  is  to  collect  waste  from  the  automotive  industry  and recycle  it  within  the  same  sector  in  order  to  maintain  the technical quality and economic value of the materials with a view to their reuse in new vehicles.\n\nI\n\n02",

The copper recycled by  GAIA  is  of  a  high-quality,  enabling  it  to  meet demanding technical specifications and to replace virgin material;\n- \u25cf recycling of polypropylene  (plastic material): GAIA collects  bumpers  from  dismantlers  and  garages  and ensures  that  they  are  processed  in  order  to  meet  the Renault's technical specifications;\n- \u25cf recycling  of  scrap  metal  from  production  (aluminium  or steel sheets and machining chips): loops between Renault plants  or  between  Renault  plants  and  suppliers  of  metal parts have been set up in France, Spain and Brazil;\n- \u25cf recycling of platinum-group metals: GAIA collects catalytic converters  from  end-of-life  vehicles  from dismantlers,  from  which  it  extracts  the  platinum-group metals.  These  recycled  metals  are  then  sold  to  an  auto industry  supplier  to  be  re-used  in  the  manufacturing  of catalytic converters.\n\nThese  closed  loops  contribute  to  the  achievement  of Renault's objectives for the use of recycled materials in new vehicles.  The  collection  and  transportation  of  materials during the recycling process are also optimised to achieve the greatest reduction in the environmental footprint of the recycled materials.\n\nThe  Group  regularly  develops  new  loops  for  reusing materials from end-of-life vehicles, notably through collaborative public-private research projects (see DECORE project box below, for example).\n\n## DECORE project (De carbonation of the Co ckpit and Re cycling/ Re conditioning )\n\nLed by equipment manufacturer Faurecia and with the participation of Renault as a pioneering manufacturer in the circular economy, the DECORE consortium focuses on three major areas:\n\n- \u25cf Designing new materials based on recycled and/or bio-sourced materials for the Interior and Seats scope.\n- \u25cf Developing car cockpits made of recycled (or biobased) and recyclable materials.\n- \u25cf Extending the life of vehicles through reconditioning and upgrade solutions.\n\nThis consortium, which also includes the CEA, a public scientific, technical and industrial research organisation, and MTB RECYCLING, an SME recycler and equipment manufacturer with expertise in complex waste management, aims to provide:\n\n- \u25cf concrete solutions to reduce the carbon footprint and increase the use of recycled and/or biobased materials;\n- \u25cf and by 2030, cockpits designed with newly developed technologies, with a carbon impact of 85% compared with 2019 and incorporating 40% recycled or biobased materials.\n\nSupported by the government as part of the Investing in the Future Programme (PIA), this project benefits from the commitment of the public authorities and the control of BPI France's programmes to develop technological expertise in France related to carbon neutrality and the circular economy.\n\n## Renault Group, founding member of the Ellen MacArthur Foundation and the RECORD network\n\nThe Ellen MacArthur Foundation works with businesses, universities and decision-makers to promote circular economic models and develop the scientific and managerial knowledge required for their adoption.\n\nFor more information: https://www.ellenmacarthurfoundation.org/\n\nRECORD is  a  recognised  player  in  France  in  applied  research  in  the  field  of  end-of-life  product  management,  waste  management  and resource efficiency in a circular economy perspective.

In addition, from  the  2010s  onwards,  investments  were  also  made  to replace the high-power boilers at the sites with decentralised low-power  boilers,  close  to  the  production  facilities,  thereby optimising  the  power  output  and  limiting  heat  losses  in  the networks. Currently, the main focus is on the modernisation of gas  boilers  and  the  installation  of  low  NOx-emission  burners. SO2  emissions  decreased  from  36  metric  tons  in  2010  to  7.4 metric tons in 2023. NOx emissions decreased from 597 metric tons in 2010 to 311.5 metric tons in 2023 22 .\n\n## 2.2.2.3.1.2 Vehicle use\n\n## Reduction of pollutant emissions from internal combustion engine vehicles\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAll vehicles sold by Renault Group worldwide have received appropriate  approval  from  the  relevant  authorities  in accordance with all regulations in force.\n\nFollowing the widespread introduction of particulate filters for diesel vehicles, associated with the Euro 5 standard, the Euro  6x  standards  have  lowered  the  authorised  level  of particulate emissions for all engines, while at the same time reducing  by  more  than  half,  compared  with  the  Euro  5 standard, the limits for nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions (from 180 to 80 mg/km for diesels), bringing them closer to those authorised for petrol vehicles (60 mg/km).\n\nSuch a reduction was made possible by the implementation of  post-treatment  systems  such  as  NOx  traps  or  SCR (Selective  Catalytic  Reduction).  The  NOx  trap  is  a  chemical system  that  traps  nitrogen  oxide,  allowing  them  to  be reduced to neutral gases. It has been fitted to certain diesel passenger  cars  sold  by  Renault  Group  in  Europe  since September 2015. SCR technology works to convert nitrogen oxide into water and nitrogen by injecting urea.\n\nAt the same  time, the identification of significant differences between emissions measured in real use and in the laboratory or approval led the European Commission to define a real-use test protocol, introduced with the Euro 6dtemp  standard  (RDE,  Real  Driving  Emissions  protocol). Without  waiting  for  these  new  standards,  Renault  Group had,  starting  in  July  2015,  studied  the  implementation  of improvements on all of its Euro 6b diesel production aiming to further limit emissions in customer use. These improvements  were  gradually  rolled  out  from  August  2016 on the diesel vehicles in the range.\n\nThe rollout of Euro 6 standards is a major step forward in the reduction  of  pollutant  emissions  from  internal  combustion engine vehicles. As mentioned above, these standards have introduced  measurements  under  real  and  variable  driving conditions (RDE protocol) of the emissions of pollutants such as nitrogen oxide or particles in addition to the measurements  made  in  the  laboratory  based  on  the standardised  test  cycle.  By  nature,  these  measurements cannot cover the very wide variety of customer uses: driving and weather conditions, driving style, vehicle load, etc. This is why  Renault,  for  several  years,  has  supported  the European approach aimed at implementing measurements under  real  driving  conditions  (RDE  protocol)  in  addition  to implementing  the  new  WLTP  laboratory  test  procedure, more  representative  of  average  customer  use  and  the diversity of vehicle equipment than the NEDC cycle.\n\nThe  adaptation  of  Renault  Group  vehicles  to  these  new standards required an ambitious programme of investments and development.\n\nThe  Euro  6d-temp  phase  has  been  applicable  since September  2017  for  new  models  (new  types)  and  since September 2019 for all new vehicles (all types). The European Commission simultaneously introduced the new laboratory test  procedure,  WLTP,  which  has  been  applicable  since September 2017 for new models and from September 2018 for all new vehicles.\n\nThe Euro 6d-final phase came into force between January 2020 (new types) and January 2021 (all types) for passenger vehicles and in January 2022 for commercial vehicles.\n\nIn order to meet Euro 6d-temp and Euro6 d-final standards, SCR  technology,  which  Renault  has  used  on  its  Trafic  and Master  commercial  vehicles  since  the  Euro  6b  standards, has been fitted to the entire range of diesel passenger cars in  Europe. This SCR technology, which is more restrictive in use  because  the  vehicle  has  to  be  fitted  with  a  urea  tank that has to be recharged regularly, reduces nitrogen oxide with  enhanced  efficiency  over  a  wide  range  of  engine operating  conditions.  For  the  final  Euro  6d-final  stage,  the diesel  emission  treatment  system  was  enhanced  with  a second  SCR  system  to  improve  NOx  treatment  efficiency even more across all engine operating ranges.\n\nFor  the  petrol  engines  in  the  range,  the  trifunctional catalysis  system  simultaneously  treats  the  oxidation  of unburnt hydrocarbons (HC) and carbon monoxide (CO) and the reduction of nitrogen oxide (NOx). The various stages of Eurox  standards  have  been  achieved  by  improving  the engine settings and the load of precious metals in catalysts. From the Euro 6d-temp stage onwards, direct fuel injection engines  have  been  fitted  with  a  particulate  filter.  As  with diesel, this filter allows a drastic reduction in the number of particles emitted by vehicles. With the Euro 6d-final stage, all petrol engines have been fitted with a particulate filter.",

This committee is chaired by two members of the Leadership Team: the Director of Corporate Engineering  and  the  Director  of  Quality  and  Customer Satisfaction.\n\n## Reduction of pollutant emissions from electric vehicles\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nElectric vehicles form a major strand of the Group's strategy to  combat  atmospheric  pollution.  Once  they  reach  a significant  proportion  of  all  vehicles  on  the  road,  they  will contribute  to  improving  air  quality  because  they  do  not generate exhaust emissions during use 23 .

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\nSustainable development\n\n## Treatment of external air drawn into the cabin\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWhen driving, the main influence on the quality of cabin air is that of external air, given the fast air renewal flow required for passenger comfort (200 m 3 /h on average). Therefore, as soon  as  it  designs  its  vehicles,  Renault  ensures  that  the architecture  enables  an  air  treatment  system  to  be  fitted. Two types of technical solutions are implemented:\n\n- 1. cabin particle filter (also known as a pollen filter): made of non-woven  fibres,  it  is  designed  to  trap  the  smallest particles,  with  an  effectiveness  of  over  85%  efficiency from 2.5 \u03bc m in diameter and 95% for particles above 10 \u03bc m. All  passenger  cars  worldwide  sold  under  the  Renault, Dacia, Alpine and Renault Korea Motors brands are fitted with a cabin particulate filter as standard ;\n- 2. combination  cabin  filters: there  are  pollen  filters  with  a layer  of  activated  charcoal  grains  added.  In  addition  to particles,  the  activated  charcoal  traps  gases,  including aromatic compounds and nitrogen dioxide. These filters are sized to trap an average of more than 85% of these compounds  on  the  Renault  vehicles  on  which  they  are fitted. Most of the latest passenger car models marketed under the Renault brand in Europe come with combination filters as standard on all versions .\n\n## Emissions from materials within the cabin\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWhen  the  vehicle  is  exposed  to  sunlight,  the  presence  of volatile chemical substance emissions from materials in the cabin  may  become  overbearing  when  compared  with  the quality of the air outside. Renault has therefore set itself the objective of managing these emissions in order to minimise their impact on passenger health and comfort.\n\nThus,  since  2009,  all  materials  within  all  internal  vehicle parts (cabin and trunk) whose weight is over 100 g have been subject to specifications deployed to all relevant suppliers, in  an  effort  to  manage  emissions  levels  from  the  main categories of volatile organic compounds.\n\nRenault  also  ensures  that  any  odours  caused  by  the  main contributors to the vehicle's atmosphere are limited. This is assessed by a panel of experts who are specifically trained in  Renault's  own  methods,  based  on  olfactory  descriptors and an understanding of odour levels.\n\n## 2.2.2.3.2 Substance risk management\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn 2021, the Group set a goal: to reduce the number of priority products  for  substitution  by  50%  between  2021 24 and  2030 (see 2023 status at the beginning of section 2.2.2.3).\n\nRenault  Group  has  an  organisation  dedicated  to  the management of dangerous substances, capable of taking into account regulations on substances as well as proactive anticipation policies (in particular, the ban on carcinogenic, mutagenic  or  reprotoxic  substances).  The  three  divisions devoted  to  this  activity  support  the  rollout  of  initiatives  in day-to-day processes:\n\n- \u25cf in  collaboration  with  the  departments  responsible  for occupational health and working conditions, the Industrial Hygiene and Chemical Risks Division manages workers'  exposure  to  chemical  risks  at  all  production, engineering  and  logistics  sites  around  the  world.  It monitors  the  chemicals  present  in  the  formulations delivered to Renault Group, verifies the classification and labelling  of  chemicals  and  ensures  compliance  with  the product  safety  data  sheets  provided  by  suppliers.  It provides  an  initial  assessment  of  the  chemical  risk  in accordance  with  generic  use  conditions.  In  addition,  it alerts  and  coordinates  the  engineering  centres  and  the sites  if  products  containing  priority  risk  substances  are used  so  that  they  can  look  for  technical  solutions  to eliminate  them.  Lastly,  it  is  responsible  for  monitoring chemical  environments  by  sampling  and  analysing pollutants  at  workstations.  In  addition  to  the  usual substances and proven risks, Renault Group is attentive to the  potential  health  impacts  of  innovative  processes such  as  3D  printing,  as  well  as  proposed  changes  to regulations. In this context, a PFAS project was launched this  year  to  increase  our  knowledge  of  the  presence  of these substances in the products used by the Group.\n- \u25cf the  Materials  Engineering  Division manages  the  use  of substances in vehicle design and anticipates the ban on the most problematic several years before their regulatory  ban.  It  monitors  substances  contained  in vehicles  based  on  information  declared  by  suppliers using  the  IMDS  (International  Material  Data  System) system,  shared  with  35  international  carmakers.  It enables  Renault  Group  to  fulfil  the  information  and transparency obligations required by regulations (REACH, the  European  waste  directive  and  now  the  financial directives).  It  steers  the  search  for  alternative  technical solutions enabling the elimination of priority risk substances  by  relying  on  relays  within  each  branch  of engineering (vehicle, mechanics, after-sales), and reinforces this approach with its counterparts both within and  outside  the  Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi  Alliance.  It defines and steers compliance actions in the concerned entities, anticipates default risks upstream of the supply chains  and  designs  ways  to  transform  regulatory constraints into economic and competitive opportunities. In  addition  to  standard  substances  and  those  with identified risks, Renault Group pays close attention to the",

For the comfort of residents living near all its sites, Renault measures noise levels periodically and goes beyond regulatory requirements.\n\nThe  Group  actively  works  to  control  noise  at  both  existing and new facilities, right from the project phase, whether this involves  a  new  vehicle  or  a  new  activity.  Studies  into  the impact  of  noise  (characterisation  of  noise  sources,  3D modelling), the selection of acoustically efficient equipment,\n\nand soundproofing and refurbishment work all contribute to achieving  this  objective.  Action  is  focused  on  extraction chimneys, boiler rooms, scrap metal and logistics activities, which  are  generally  the  main  sources  of  external  noise  at our sites.\n\n## Vehicle use\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAll  vehicles  marketed  by  Renault  Group  in  Europe  in  2023 have road noise emissions of 70 dB(A) or less, in accordance with the second phase of European regulation 540/2014/EC, applicable  to  all vehicles produced  since  July  2022. The Group is already preparing for the third phase, which will lower  the  permissible  level  for  most  passenger  cars  to 68  dB(A)  in  July  2024.  This  includes  work  on  improving  tyre noise, engine acoustic radiation and insulation and exhaust system attenuation.\n\nWith  a  certified  noise  level  well  below  68  dB(A);  Renault electric vehicles already meet the limits applicable starting in July 2024 nearly two years in advance, thus contributing to the  reduction  of  ambient  noise  and  the  quality  of  life  in urban areas. In addition, they produce a net improvement in users'  comfort:  the  noise  inside  an  electric  vehicle  is approximately  10  dB  lower  than  that  of  an  internal combustion engine vehicle.\n\nAt the international level, the regulations concerning vehicle noise  are  most  often  based  on  European  regulations, possibly adopted a few years later. The vehicles marketed by  Renault  Group  outside  Europe,  which  have  noise  levels comparable  to  their  European  versions,  therefore  often anticipate locally applicable regulations by several years.\n\nI\n\n02",

The main pressure factors of the Renault Group business model are as follows:\n\n- \u25cf On the upstream manufacturing phase: land use change and pollution;\n- \u25cf On the downstream phase of use: climate change.\n\nNote:  the  impact  of  mineral  exploitation  is  taken  into account in land use changes and pollution.\n\nIn addition to this initial study, the Group decided to deepen its  knowledge of biodiversity issues at its operational sites. Since  2021,  these  analyses  have  been  entrusted  to  a specialised  design  office,  and  by  the  end  of  2023, 28 diagnoses had been conducted. This work highlights the ecological sensitivities of each site and identified actions to encourage biodiversity. Biodiversity stakes are divided into three levels: high, moderate and low. This level is determined by  the  design  office  by  taking  into  account  elements available in the bibliography and elements identified on the ground  such  as  the  presence  of  protected  species  and habitats or wetlands.\n\nOf the analysed 28 sites, seven present significant stakes; in particular  the  presence  of  protected  species,  including amphibious  voles,  Halimium  alyssoides,  Parana  pines  and brown howler monkeys. For the other 21 sites, the stakes are moderate (10 sites) or even low (11 sites). In total, more than 150 protected species have been observed on our sites and are now taken into account in day-to-day management.\n\nRenault  Group's  activities  are  100%  directly  and  indirectly dependent  on  the  ecosystem  services  provided  by biodiversity.",

The level  of  deployment  of  these  best  practices  is  monitored regularly,  and  the  Group  works  in  partnership  with  a specialist engineering firm to define an indicator to quantify the biodiversity gains of the implemented actions.\n\nOn  the  project  side,  the  Group  has  incorporated  a  new requirement into its internal tool for mapping major risks in order  to  ensure  that  the  'Avoid,  Reduce,  Offset'  (ARO) sequence  is  implemented  during  development,  artificial development  or  intervention projects in areas with biodiversity  issues.  This  requirement  applies  to  all  sites regardless of local regulations.\n\nFor  example,  in  2023,  as  part  of  a  project  to  bring  railway lines  back  into  service,  the  initial  project  was  modified  in order to preserve the fauna and flora that had found refuge in an area identified as wetland.\n\nLastly, in the Curitiba site in Brazil, Renault devotes 37% of its space (2.5 million m 2 ) to protecting a primary forest area. This virgin forest, made up mainly of araucaria trees, a species of pine threatened with extinction and protected under Brazilian law, is home to more than 170 species of animal.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nand  Real  Estate)  attended  biodiversity  awareness  training as part of an 'ecolomics' training course 26 .\n\n## Outside our own operations:\n\n- \u25cf In 2023, Renault Group incorporated biodiversity issues into the update of its 'Green Procurement Guidelines', a public document aimed at precisely defining our expectations of our suppliers in terms of environmental protection.\n- \u25cf Natural rubber : since 2019, Renault has been a member of the  Global  Platform  for  Sustainable  Natural  Rubber (GPSNR), an initiative aiming to improve the environmental  and  socioeconomic  performance  of  the natural  rubber  sector,  which  notably  includes  actions  to fight against  deforestation.  In  2022,  Renault  Group adopted  its  Sustainable  Natural  Rubber  Policy,  a  set  of commitments aligned with the objectives of the GPSNR. In 2023, Renault Group:\n- -sits on the platform's executive committee; and\n- -funds, alongside  Michelin,  an  'Agroforestry  Capacity Building  Thailand'  project.  This  field  project  aims  to engage 1,000 small farmers producing natural rubber in southern  Thailand  by  2025.  The  aim  is  to  reduce  the environmental impacts of plantations while increasing the  economic  resilience  of  farmers,  in  particular improving their food security.\n- \u25cf Biobased  materials: since  2022,  Renault  Group  has applied  a  Biobased  Materials  Policy  to  ensure  that  the expected gains in terms of carbon footprint reduction do not  lead  to  adverse  effects  on  people  and  ecosystems: Each  proposed  material  must  now  be  approved  by  a dedicated internal committee.\n\nIn  2023,  around  thirty  employees  from  the  sales  network and  corporate  functions  (Sustainable  Development,  HSEE",

The oceans and  their  ecosystems  play  a  crucial  role  both  in climate regulation and in generating livelihoods for women and men (Details: https://www.noseabedmining.org/).\n- \u25cf Occasional tree planting initiatives, particularly in Colombia (5,000 trees in 2023) and Spain (1,000 trees in 2023).\n\nBeyond these specific measures in our own operations and outside, protecting the biodiversity of species and ecosystems  also  requires  reducing  pollutant  emissions  in ecosystems (air, water, soil: see 2.2.2.3.1, 2.2.2.4.2 and 2.2.2.4.3), reducing pressure on resources and forests, producing less waste (see 2.2.2.2), and reducing greenhouse gas emissions (see  2.2.2.1).  Renault's  continuous  efforts  to  prevent  and mitigate  the  environmental  impact  of  its  activities  and products help to combat ecosystem depletion in this way.\n\n## 2.2.2.4.2 Water consumption and quality EFPD8a  EFPD11a\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPreserving  water  resources  is  an  ongoing  concern  for Renault, both to ensure long-term supply and to reduce its impact on ecosystems. For this reason, the Group has set a goal  of  minimising  the  impact  of  its  activities  on  this precious  resource  through  the  implementation  of  the following five objectives:\n\n- \u25cf reduce water  consumption  at  source  as  well  as  the quantities of wastewater through well-designed processes and  optimised  management.  For  example,  in  surface treatment,  which  is  one  of  the  main  water  consumers  in  a car  plant,  by  making  rinsing  flow  rates  dependent  on  the presence  of  the  body  or  by  installing  inter-stage  rinsing ramps (which limit contamination from one bath to the next through chaining by the body), the amounts of water used and the effluents to be treated can be reduced at source;\n- \u25cf reuse water where possible for the same use: cooling in a closed circuit, increasing the lifespan of baths (to reduce the draining frequency), etc.;\n- \u25cf recycle water for other compatible uses, with or without additional  treatment.  For  example,  the  Sofasa  plant (Colombia)  recycles  saline  concentrates  from  reverse osmosis  water  to  the  flushing  of  toilets  and  the  water curtains (air cleaners) of paint pits;\n- \u25cf minimise the impact of residual waste on the environment  through  efficient  and  strictly  controlled treatment processes;\n- \u25cf control the risk of accidental pollution of surface water by installing  the  means  needed  to  confine  water  from accidental spillages and water used for firefighting.\n\n## Water consumption\n\nThe amount of water consumed per vehicle produced is one of  the  key  components  of  Renault  Group's  environmental\n\nfootprint.  During  2023,  frequent  and  sometimes  prolonged interruptions  in  production  activity  resulted  in  a  large number of treatment baths being emptied, as well as more frequent cleaning/disinfection operations  on  sensitive equipment  (cooling  towers,  domestic  hot  water  circuits). Furthermore, the first effects of climate change are already visible,  with  more  water  being  used  to  cool  our  processes than ever before. With a still large 'heel' effect due to lower production  volumes  than  before  the  COVID  crisis,  the indicator  of  external  water  supply  per  vehicle  produced  is nevertheless significantly improved compared with 2022 at 4.2 m 3 /vehicle.\n\nIn  order  to  accelerate  the  progress  curve,  the  Group  set ambitious new water consumption reduction targets for the coming years in 2023. Water consumption management will be  strengthened  at  the  industrial  sites  in  order  to  achieve these objectives:\n\n- \u25cf Consumption  monitoring  will  be  strengthened,  with  all meters eventually connected to the network and internal metering systems added;\n- \u25cf A detailed  analysis  of  water  consumption  will  be conducted  at  each  site,  including  a  complete  and detailed  inventory  of  consumption  points,  input/output water  balances  and  a  comparative  positioning  of  the processes  that  consume  the  most  water  relative  to  the Group's other comparable sites;\n- \u25cf Best  practices  for  reducing  water  consumption  will  be rolled  out  across  all  industrial  sites:  leak  control,  heel management, optimisation of water consumption on the most  energy-intensive  processes,  deployment  of  less energy-intensive technologies (e.g. nickel-free phosphate treatment), etc.\n- \u25cf The  same  applies  to  good  water  reuse  practices (increasing the service life of paint baths, for example);\n- \u25cf A  model  change  will  be  built  on  each  industrial  site  to explain the 2025-2030 progress plans, enabling the Group to achieve its 2025 targets and 2030 ambitions;\n- \u25cf Action plans for drought crisis periods will be prepared in advance;\n- \u25cf Lastly, a dashboard on the progress of the rollout of best practices for managing and reducing water consumption at each industrial site is set up at the Group level.\n\nThe  sales  network  sites  are  also  working  to  reduce  water consumption:  RRG  decided  to  stop  washing  customer vehicles  after  repair  between  May  and  October  2023, enabling a 27% consumption gain to be measured from June.\n\nThe  Tangier  bodywork  and  assembly  plant  in  Morocco  is equipped  with  the  most  advanced  technologies  available for  recycling  wastewater from the manufacturing process. Following the additional investments made  in 2015 to  increase  the  volume of industrial effluents recycled and thus  keep  pace  with  the  increase  in  the  site's  production rate,  the  volume  of  water  saved  amounted  to  nearly 280,000 m 3 per year on average. The Tangier site is the plant with the lowest external water supply ratio: 1.4 m 3 per vehicle produced in 2023 (compared with 1.5 in 2022).\n\nI\n\n02",

Since late 2015, the Tangier plant, designed not to  discharge  any  industrial  waste,  has  had  a  basin  that enables it to confine any accidental pollution and avoid its discharge  into  the  environment  and  to  treat  rainwater drained on the site by decantation.\n\nAnother lever currently being deployed in the bodywork and assembly  plants  is  the  removal  of  nickel  salts  (toxic  and ecotoxic substances) used in the phosphate treatment bath (surface treatment process). This change reduces the flow of nickel discharged as well as the water consumption of the process.\n\nSince  2021,  three  plants  have  already  implemented  this change, and two more are planned for 2024.\n\nFor  the  third  year,  toxic  metal  emissions  from  the  Group's industrial  activities  are  being  monitored  using  an  indicator that  sums  up  the  quantities  of  zinc  and  nickel  per  vehicle produced.  These  two  substances  are  the  main  metals emitted  during  surface  treatment  activities  aimed  at treating vehicle corrosion. At all our vehicle production sites, physicochemical  treatment  processes  are  implemented and regularly monitored in terms of performance to reduce the  amounts  of  metals  discharged.  The  process  change mentioned  above  (modification  of  surface  treatment)  will also contribute to reducing nickel emissions at source.\n\n## Distribution of water supplies by source\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nScope: all manufacturing plants and the main Renault Group tertiary, logistics and engineering sites, excluding establishments in the RRG sales network (reporting scope described in appendix 2.6.1.3)\n\n## External water supply (\u221a)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n(\u221a) Indicators audited by the independent third party at a reasonable level of assurance for the 2023 financial year.\n\nExternal water supply includes drinking water, industrial water, groundwater, surface water and rainwater networks.",

No scope correction.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSoil and water tables are environments that can potentially allow pollution from past activities to come into contact with targets to be protected (humans, natural environments, etc.).\n\nRenault  has  therefore  implemented  a  policy  to  prevent pollution of these environments and, when past pollution is suspected,  implements  specific  management  strategies. This  policy  is  applied  to  all  Group  facilities  presenting  a potential pollution risk,  i.e.  operational  industrial  facilities, former industrial facilities converted to other uses, as well as  the  Renault  Retail  Group  (RRG)  sales  network.  Renault aims  to  maintain  in-house  skills  in  prevention  of  soil pollution and remediation.\n\nIn  2023,  the  manufacturing  sites,  as  well  as  the  main engineering,  logistics  and  head  office  sites  of  Renault Group 27 represented a total area of 1,815 hectares, of which 49.2% are impervious areas such as buildings, parking lots, roads and paths. Total surface area and the proportion of impervious  surfaces  did  not  change  significantly  from  the previous year, at constant scope.\n\n## Prevention\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nA t industrial  sites, the  prevention  policy  is based  on  three  key  tools.  A  risk-rating  grid  is used to assess the level of pollution prevention and  reinforce  it,  if  necessary,  by  prioritising required rehabilitation work.\n\nIn  the  case  of  new  production  facilities,  the  soil  prevention guide  describes  the  best  techniques  to  implement  in  each type  of  facility.  Both  of  these  tools  are  in  use  across  all Renault  industrial  sites  worldwide.  The  prevention  policy ultimately relies on monitoring of the quality of groundwater. This monitoring, which is carried out systematically  when  regulations  so  require  (all  industrial sites  in  France),  is  also  carried  out  voluntarily  by  Renault when  potential  sources  of  pollution  are  identified,  to  spot any movement of pollutants to sensitive areas and to take appropriate measures as early as possible.\n\nIn  the RRG sales network (France and Europe), all  sites  have  for  several  years  been equipped with pollution prevention tools, and oil and fuel are now stored above ground or in double-wall tanks fitted with alarms and retention tanks.\n\n## Remediation\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe  management  of  past  subsoil  pollution hinges  on  a  risk  assessment  based  on  the source-vector-target  concept  and  aims  to ensure  the  suitability  of  the  subsoil  for  the planned or identified uses.\n\nThere  are  several  stages  to  the  pollution  management system:\n\n- \u25cf a  historic  and  documentary  study,  including  an  analysis of the site's vulnerability, was conducted for operational industrial sites, former industrial sites converted to other uses  and  the  RRG  sales  network.  It  is  updated  as necessary.  This  study  enables  the  identification  of potential  sources  of  pollution  and  the  evaluation  of  the vulnerability  level  at  the  facility  and  in  its  immediate surroundings;\n- \u25cf a  physical  diagnostic  analysis  of  the  soils  is  conducted based  on  the  results  of  the  historic  and  documentary research;\n- \u25cf if the  diagnostic  analysis  confirms  the  presence  of pollution sources, a quantitative evaluation of the health risks is performed in order to assess the exposure risk for site  users  and  the  immediate  surroundings  (workers, residents, school children, etc.);\n- \u25cf remediation operations may be started depending on the results of the two preceding steps. These operations are carried out by specialised service providers with recognised  expertise,  under  the  supervision  of  the Renault soil specialist.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRRG  uses  the  same  assessment  method  to clean contaminated soils on former oil and fuel storage sites, even when this contamination is due to the former owner.\n\nI\n\nSustainable development\n\n02",

This includes the electric (EV)  and  plug-in  hybrid  (PHEV)  ranges  of  all  the  Group's brands.  The  due  diligence  carried  out  for  the  detailed verification of the DNSH criteria and minimum safeguards is described in the methodology note (see 2.6.1.1).\n\nThe  scope  for  aligning  the  activities  contributing  to  the objective  of  the  transition  to  a  circular  economy  will  be published for the 2024 financial year, in accordance with the regulation mentioned above.\n\n## Key performance indicators (KPI) for aligned activities\n\nBelow is a summary of the KPI values for the 2023 and 2022 financial years, using the same set of DNSH criteria. Detailed tables  complying  with  the  regulations  are  given  on  the following pages.\n\n## Turnover KPI summary\n\n|                                            |                                                                                      | Eligibility              | Eligibility             | Eligibility             | Alignment               | Alignment               | Alignment               |\n|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|\n| Environmental  objective                   | Activity                                                                             | 2023  eligible  turnover | % 2023  total  turnover | % 2022  total  turnover | 2023  aligned  turnover | % 2023  total  turnover | % 2022  total  turnover |\n|                                            | 3.3 Low carbon-intensity manufacturing technologies  for transport                   | 47,173                   | 90.1%                   | 89.8%                   | 5,124                   | 9.8%                    | 10.5%                   |\n| Climate change                             | 3.4 Manufacture of batteries                                                         | 25                       | 0.0%                    | N/A                     | 25                      | N/A                     | N/A                     |\n| mitigation                                 | 6.5 Transportation by motorcycles, passenger  vehicles and commercial vehicles       | 4,007                    | 7.7%                    | 7.0%                    | 342                     | 0.7%                    | 0.7%                    |\n|                                            | 7.4 Installation, maintenance and repair of charging  stations for electric vehicles | 17                       | 0.0%                    | N/A                     | 17                      | 0.0%                    | N/A                     |\n| Subtotal: Climate change mitigation        | Subtotal: Climate change mitigation                                                  | 51,222                   | 97.8%                   | 96.8%                   | 5,508                   | 10.5%                   | 11.3%                   |\n| Transition to a  circular economy          | 5.4 Sale of second-hand goods                                                        | 1,126                    | 2.1 %                   | N/A                     | N/A                     | N/A                     | N/A                     |\n| Subtotal: Transition to a circular economy | Subtotal: Transition to a circular economy                                           | 1 ,126                   | 2.1 %                   | N/A                     | N/A                     | N/A                     | N/A                     |\n| TOTAL TURNOVER                             | TOTAL TURNOVER                                                                       | 52,348                   | 99.9%                   | 96.8%                   | 5,508                   | 10.5%                   | 11.3%                   |\n| N/A: not available                         | N/A: not available                                                                   | (M EUR)                  |                         |                         | (M EUR)                 |                         |                         |",

This is why Renault Group works closely with various players who also tackle the subject - local and regional authorities, startups, companies, universities, etc. with  the  shared  aim  of  offering  solutions  adapted  to everyone's individual needs.\n\n## 2.3.1.1 A 'Made in Renault' and ecosystem innovation for sustainable mobility  EFPD14a\n\nElectric  mobility  and  car-sharing  are  the  best  immediately available  responses  to  accelerate  the  energy  transition, fight  against  climate  change  and  improve  air  quality  in cities. Renault Group has been committed to the development of large-scale electric mobility for more than 10  years  with  the  simple  aim  of  making  electric  mobility accessible to all by meeting everyone's needs.\n\n## A. Electrifying the range\n\nA pioneer since the launch of ZOE, Renault Group offers an electric engine or an electrified (hybrid) engine on all its new models  sold  in  2023.  This  year,  the  Group  sold  more  than 368,000  electrified  vehicles  worldwide.  The  Renault  brand achieved a 40% of electrified vehicles in its European sales.\n\nThe  action  plan,  indicators  and  objectives  related  to  the electrification of passenger and commercial vehicle ranges are described in section 2.2.2.1.2.\n\n## B. Offering mobility, financial, energy and data services: Mobilize\n\nFor  Renault  Group,  the  electric  vision  goes  far  beyond  the car, which is why it created a fourth brand in January 2021: Mobilize. Mobilize's  strength  lies  in  its  comprehensive offering of mobility, energy and data. Knowing how to deal with  these  three  subjects  means  optimising  technological solutions and therefore costs\u2026 towards zero carbon.\n\nBuilding on partner ecosystems that are complementary to our  own,  the  brand  wants  to  provide  concrete  solutions  to promote  green  transition  and  develop  more  accessible mobility  for  people  and  goods,  whether  in  complex, congested urban environments or in rural areas.\n\n## Examples of Mobilize's contributions:\n\nIn  the  field  of mobility , Mobilize  encourages  the  transition from  ownership  to  use.  The  action  plan  is  described  in section 2.2.2.1.2. The key performance indicator is the number of vehicles made available to users of car-sharing services in Europe (more than 8,000 in 2023, most of them electric).\n\nIn the field of energy , the aim is to bring electric vehicles into everyday  life,  in  particular  with  the  'Vehicle-to-grid'  (V2G) system, repair solutions (see section 2.2.2.2.3.5) and secondlife solutions for electric vehicle batteries (2.2.2.1.2).\n\n## C. Hydrogen mobility\n\nFor information  on  innovations  concerning  hydrogen mobility, see paragraph 1.4.3.2.C Innovation/Energy Transition and Action #2 of the Climate Plan (2.2.2.1.2.1).\n\n## D. Innovating  with  our  partners:  what  autonomous vehicle for the future?\n\nThe car is already electric and connected: tomorrow it could also  be  autonomous,  with  the  benefits  of  smoother,  more fluid  traffic  and  improved  safety.  The  development  of autonomous cars and shuttles will accelerate the growth of electric, autonomous and shared mobility services. They will promote  complementarity  between  modes  of  transport, multimodality  and  make  the  overall  system  cleaner,  safer, more accessible, more effective and more efficient.\n\nFrom  2020  to  2023,  Renault  Group  contributed  to  the national  experimentation  programme  for  autonomous vehicles, led by the 'Safety and Acceptability of Autonomous  Mobility' (SAM) consortium around the Automotive Platform (PFA). Initiated by the French government,  this  consortium  brought  together  eleven manufacturers, including Renault Group, and six academic partners to work in three areas:\n\n- \u25cf Create  a  'French  autonomous  mobility  team'  bringing together  automotive  manufacturers,  public  transport operators, technology suppliers, infrastructure managers and territories.\n- \u25cf Prepare  the  scale-up  of  the  activity,  specifying  its conditions for success (safety, infrastructure, connectivity, user behaviour, environmental impacts, etc.) and the economic model.\n- \u25cf Contribute  to  the  development  and  implementation  of the regulatory framework (Decree No. 2021-873 of 29 June 2021  on  the  circulation  of  delegated  driving  vehicles,  a regulatory framework that is unique in Europe).",

To  this  end,  Renault  Group  has confirmed  its  commitment  to  the  study  and  development  of automated  and  connected  vehicles  intended  for  automated driving and new transport or shared mobility services.\n\n## E. Designing innovation with public players and private partners\n\nRenault Group contributes to collective thinking on sustainable mobility  through  its  involvement  in  numerous  European collaborative projects involving public and private partners.\n\nIn  the  field  of mobility  ecosystems , one  example  is  the GIANTS  (Green  Intelligent Affordable New  Transport Solutions)  project,  launched  in  2023  and  involving  Renault Group  in  partnership  with  other  carmakers,  POLIS  (an association  representing  the  main  European  cities  for innovative  transport  solutions)  and  European  universities, with  the  aim  of  offering  affordable,  accessible  mobility solutions to advanced and emerging markets.\n\nRenault  Group  is  also  involved  in  several  European  projects  in connection with the green transition , such as the TRANSENSUSLCA project, relating to battery life cycle analysis (https://www.eucar.be/project-in-focus-transensus-lca/) or BATTEREVERSE and BATRAW in the field of battery recycling.\n\nTo learn more about the Group's main innovation partners, see paragraph 1.4.2.4 'Innovation partners'.\n\n## F. An innovation jointly developed with the academic world\n\nRenault  Group  has  set  itself  the  challenge  of  supporting research in the world of education, by bringing researchers and  professionals  together  to  compare  ideas  so  that together  we  can  build  the  technological  solutions  and services of tomorrow and understand the purchasing habits of future consumers. The Group thus supports nine chairs in which its experts are involved in high-value subjects.\n\nTo learn more about the Group's main innovation partners, see paragraph 1.4.2.4, 'Innovation partners' for a list of these chairs.\n\n## The Institute for Sustainable Mobility (IMD): meeting mobility challenges around the world\n\nThe Renault-ParisTech Sustainable Mobility Institute (IMD) is a  cooperative  research  platform  between  Renault  Group and six leading engineering schools focusing on sustainable mobility issues and solutions.\n\nBoth a research community and a talent incubator, the IMD relies  on  teams  from  the  following  French  engineering schools:  \u00c9cole  des  Mines,  \u00c9cole  polytechnique,  T\u00e9l\u00e9com Paris,  Chimie  Paris,  Arts  et  M\u00e9tiers  and  \u00c9cole  Nationale des Ponts et Chauss\u00e9es.\n\nSince  its  creation  in  2009,  the  IMD  has  produced  many results and enabled the recruitment of excellent engineers, thus  contributing  to  the  transformation  of  Renault  Group around the following two key objectives:\n\n- \u25cf switching from cars to mobility services;\n- \u25cf moving  towards  sustainable  and  responsible  mobility within the territories in our various markets.\n\nThe  annual  budget  granted  by  Renault  Group  to  the  IMD makes it possible to jointly fund work in four topics, on areas defined  jointly by  Renault  Group  engineers  and  the researchers:\n\n- \u25cf identifying emerging systems with high potential;\n- \u25cf analysing frugal solutions for essential mobility services.\n\nThe  annual  budget  granted  by  Renault  Group  to  the  IMD makes it possible to jointly fund work in four topics, on areas defined  jointly by  Renault  Group  engineers  and  the researchers:\n\n## Organisation of mobility:\n\n- \u25cf understanding interactions between territories, infrastructures and the various modes of transport;\n- \u25cf identifying emerging systems with high potential;\n- \u25cf analysing frugal solutions for essential mobility services.\n\n## Mobility business models:\n\n- \u25cf specifying  the  viable  economic  models  in  the  making (including  cohabitation  with  the  current  models  and  all types of transport);\n- \u25cf analysing  the  evolution  of  the  automotive  segment  and its governance;\n- \u25cf innovating effectively.within wider ecosystems.\n\n## Environment (industrial, energy, and materials sectors):\n\n- \u25cf identifying  the  international  conditions  for  transforming the  current  automotive  value  chain  towards  alternative energy vehicles and new forms of mobility;\n- \u25cf evaluating the impacts of the development of the sectors (including Hydrogen)  on  the  environment  (climate, resources) through life cycle analysis;\n- \u25cf reinforcing exchanges with partners, communicating and positioning.\n\n## Breakthrough technologies:\n\n- \u25cf identifying the disruptions linked to technologies (electrification,  electricity  storage,  driving  assistance, etc.)  and resulting from the requirements of sustainable, responsible, and inclusive development;\n- \u25cf highlighting how technological developments in infrastructure  (physical  and  Internet)  can  impact  the mobility ecosystem.\n\nAll research work can take various forms: bilateral contract between Renault  Group  and  a  laboratory,  doctoral  theses, end-of-study internships (master's degree, engineer, etc.).\n\nIn 2023,  many  research  topics  are  being  worked  on, including:\n\n- \u25cf with Polytechnique CRGi3, two subjects developed:\n- -'How can we combine service, hardware and software cycles  to  maximise  cost  and  value  for  Renault  Group and  society?'  with  Mobilize  Duo  &  energy  systems  for applications, and\n- -'The innovation diffusion dynamic - abandonment and enthusiasm  factors'  applied  to  car-sharing  (Zity), subscription (Bipi), quadricycle (Twizy-Ami) and electric vehicles.\n\nI",

(ENPC CIRED).\n\n## VeDeCom Institute - Zero-carbon communicating vehicles\n\nRenault  Group  is  one  of  the  founding  members  and  an associate donor of VeDeCom, one of the IETs (Institutes for Energy Transition) set up as part of the French government's Investment  Plan  for  the  Future  (Plan  d'investissement d'avenir). It  is  supported  by  the  NextMove competitiveness hub  and  several  local  authorities  (Yvelines  Departmental Council  and  the  Versailles  Grand  Parc  and  Saint-Quentinen-Yvelines city authorities).\n\nVeDeCom is an institute for shared and co-located research into  electric,  autonomous  and  connected  vehicles  and  the mobility  ecosystem  built  on  infrastructures  and  services addressing new uses for shared mobility and energy.\n\nVeDeCom  has  more  than  50  members  from  different industries  and  service  sectors  (automotive,  aeronautics, systems  engineering,  electronic  components,  ITC  and numerical  simulation,  infrastructure  management  and transport  operators,  digital  networks  and  energy  grid operators),  from  several  research  and  higher  education institutions,  and  from  local  authorities,  all  of  whom  have agreed to collaborate on pre-competitive and prenormative research topics.\n\nSuch  research  involves  a  multidisciplinary  effort  bringing together  physicists  and  chemists,  mechanical,  electrical and  electronics  engineers,  computer  scientists,  as  well  as sociologists,  psychologists,  economists  and  lawyers  to study the impacts and acceptability of these new types of use in order to promote suitable ergonomic and regulatory frameworks.\n\nSince  2014,  Renault  Group's  contribution  to  the  Institute's activities  consisted  of  more  than  \u20ac14  million  in  funding, including the ongoing provision of experts.\n\nIn  the  coming  years,  VeDeCom  should  continue  to  play  a major  role  in  the  French  sustainable  mobility  research ecosystem with continued support from Renault through an annual investment of around \u20ac1.3 million.\n\n## IRT Jules VERNE Force Project: carbon fibres from bio-sourced recycled materials\n\nLaunched in 2014, the FORCE project led by IRT Jules Verne in partnership  with  the  CANOE  platform  aimed  to  develop  a carbon  fibre  that  is  40%  cheaper  than  the  materials currently used in industry - mainly polyacrylonitrile fibres and made from recycled textile or cellulose from the paper industry.  This  innovative  fibre,  the  first  coils  of  which  were produced on a pilot carbonisation line installed at the Lacq CANOE  Platform  site,  offers  unprecedented  technical, economical prospects with a small environmental footprint.\n\n## 2.3.1.2 Innovation and commitment to road user safety\n\nRoad  safety  has  become  one  of  the  three  pillars  of  the sustainable  development  strategy  and  feeds  into  Renault Group's long-term commitment  to  more  responsible mobility.\n\nReducing  the  number  of  accidents  and  casualties  on Europe's  roads  and  prioritising  the  safety  of  all  road  users are among our commitments.\n\nThe Group's international expansion must be accompanied by the design of vehicles meeting regulations and security requirements  in  its  new  markets.  Because  the  causes  of accidents and injuries in these new regions differ from the traditional European market, Renault Group is expanding its accident  research  beyond  Europe,  transferring  its  own know-how and gaining expertise from local laboratories and universities as well as other key players in road-user safety.\n\nIn  order  to  fully  assume  its  responsibilities,  Renault  Group has made a two-fold commitment:\n\n- \u25cf through  its  products.  Based  on  an  analysis  of  observed risks, it incorporates solutions and innovations into all its design, manufacturing and marketing processes in order to protect vehicle occupants and others exposed to road risks (pedestrians, cyclists, etc.);\n- \u25cf in  society.  It  participates  actively  with  governments  and civil  society  throughout  the  world  to  help  improve  road user  safety.  Both  alone  and  in  collaboration  with  other organisations, Renault Group works to raise awareness of road-user  safety  and  facilitate  transfer  of  skills  among road users and road-user safety stakeholders.",

Part of the solution consists of helping the driver by assisting with the driving task (driving aids). The remainder lies in encouraging more responsible driving. Drivers need to understand the limits beyond which they will be incapable of controlling their vehicles, and the situations in which they are putting themselves at risk.\n\nThe quality of road handling and braking constitutes the fundamental dynamics of the vehicle. They are fundamental to avoiding accidents. Nevertheless, there are situations where technology should intervene to compensate for driver error. This is the purpose of these active safety systems. They intervene in difficult or emergency conditions; however, they do not do entirely replace the driver.\n\nA top priority of road user safety for Renault Group is to protect the car's occupants according to the nature and severity of the impact, regardless of their age, size or location in the vehicle, in small and large cars alike. Renault Group thus equips both the front and rear seats of its vehicles with systems to provide optimal passenger protection. The protection of other road users (pedestrians, cyclists, etc.) is also taken into account.\n\nRenault Group collaborates with French and foreign emergency services to optimise help for accident casualties. These services receive guides and attend information sessions explaining how to perform rescue operations on each new vehicle of the brands. They are also provided with late-model vehicles on which they can practise victim extraction methods. Innovative modifications are applied to the brand's vehicles to ensure that emergency firefighter interventions are safer and more effective.\n\n## 2.3.1.2.1 The Renault Group policy for road user safety  EFPD16a\n\nRenault Group is committed to safer mobility, both for the occupants  of  its vehicles and for all road users (pedestrians,  cyclists,  etc.).  Renault  Group  relies  on  the research of the LAB (laboratory for accident research and biomechanics)  to  constantly  and  concretely  improve  the safety of its products and services. For more than 50 years, the LAB has provided world-renowned scientific expertise to observe, analyse and anticipate.\n\nFounded in 1969 as an EIG (economic interest grouping) by PSA  (now  Stellantis  SA)  and  Renault  Group,  the  LAB  is  the\n\nlaboratory for accident research, biomechanics and human behaviour studies.\n\nIts  strength is based on varied, complementary skills in the domaine of safety: engineers, data scientists, biomechanics experts, physicians, cognitive ergonomics experts and field accident investigators.\n\nIn 2022, the LAB's experts began their three-year participation in a European collaborative project, Horizon  2021  (V4SAFETY),  piloted  a  European  industrial project  (ENOP)  and  participated  in  two  projects  of  the French  interministerial  delegation  for  road-user  safety (USCOMA and THORAX).\n\nThe V4SAFETY (Vehicles and VRU Virtual eValuation of Road Safety) project, funded by the EU (1) , aims to provide a reliable method for comparing safety  measures,  with  a  view  to  ensuring  cooperative,  connected,  automated  mobility.  It  will  provide  a  framework  for  managing  safety measures, whether they involve on-board safety technologies, new types of vehicles and infrastructure solutions or regulations influencing the road-user  behaviour.  The  framework  will  include  methods  for  projecting  results  in  future  scenarios  and  in  EU  regions  for  policymakers, authorities and consumer organisations.\n\nThe ENOP  (Enable  New  Occupant  seating  Position  in  automated  vehicles) project  involves  9  industrial  and  academic  partners  (LAB  GIE Renault-Stellantis, Toyota, Cellbond, Faurecia Automotive Seating, Autoliv Development AB, Bundesanstalt f\u00fcr Stra\u00dfenwesen (BASt), CEESAR, ICAI-Comillas Pontifical University and LBMC-Universit\u00e9 Gustave Eiffel). Its purpose is to better understand and model the biomechanical constraints of occupants in unusual positions that could be adopted in highly automated vehicles.\n\nThe USCOMA (Use of smartphones in manual and automated driving) and THORAX (Evaluation of the potential for reducing serious thoracic injuries by taking account of bone fragility associated with ageing) projects are funded by the French interministerial delegation for road user safety. The first is a study of the use of smartphones while driving, using the UDrive naturalistic database. The second aims to integrate age-related changes in bone mineralisation into digital models based on medical imaging. These projects are carried out with academic partners and French startups.\n\n(1) https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101075068/fr\n\nI\n\n02",

The  principle  is  simple: based  on  data  from  the  vehicle's  sensors  driving  criteria that are easily understandable because they are based on rules  from  the  highway  code  will  be  developed  in  order  to establish a driving score from the point of view of safety and behaviour. Designed in partnership with the Ecole de  Conduite  Fran\u00e7aise,  the  Safety  Score  is  starting  to  be deployed on our new vehicles; the safety Score will have the advantage  of  enabling  drivers  to  identify  areas  for improvement to help them adopt a more preventive driving style, thus reducing the risk of road accidents.\n\nThen guide: in real time, data from the vehicle's sensors and connected  systems  will  alert  and  advise  the  driver  by signalling  surrounding  or  upcoming  risks  on  the  on-board screens (dashboard and multimedia screen). The combination  of  the  navigation  system  and  maps  allow  the driver  to  be  informed  in  real  time  when  approaching  risk areas to encourage more careful driving as they move closer to  them.  All  these  features,  grouped  together  in  the Safety coach , are designed to advise the driver on safer driving.\n\nUnder certain conditions, we will also take action on speed, which accounts for more than one third of fatal accidents. Safe guardian adapts the vehicle to anticipate and prevent hazards.\n\nIn the same way as safer driving aids (Safety score / Safety coach / Safe guardian), Renault Group is deploying aids for more energy-efficient driving (see section 2.2.2.1.2.1).\n\nAll  new  models  certified  between  mid-2022  and  mid-2024 (passenger  vehicles  and  small  commercial  vehicles)  are equipped with the following as standard:\n\n- \u25cf an AEB (Advanced Emergency Braking) system to reduce the risk of a rear-end collision,\n- \u25cf an Emergency Lane Keeping system to alert and correct for unintentional lane departure,\n- \u25cf an Intelligent Speed Assist system to alert the driver if the legal speed limit is exceeded,\n- \u25cf a Driver Drowsiness & Attention Warning system to detect decreased  alertness  and  warn  the  driver  based  on  an analysis of actions,\n- \u25cf a  Reversing Detection system to detect the presence of an object in the rear field of the vehicle.\n\nThe  maximum speed of the vehicles will  also  be  limited  to 180 km/h.\n\n## Prevent, correct, protect\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThis commitment to automotive safety has been substantiated  by  the  attainment,  26  times  over,  of  the maximum 5-star rating in Euro NCAP tests, having been the first carmaker to do so in 2001 on the D-segment (Laguna II in 2001), then on the C-segment (Megane II in 2002) and lastly on  the  B-segment  (Modus  in  2004).  This  cross-disciplinary approach  has  been  enriched  by  taking  into  account  new issues  related  to  the  compatibility  of  vehicles  in  frontal impact and the phenomenon known as submarining, which is now taken into account in certain new NCAP protocols.\n\nThe effort in the field of passive safety will continue over the coming years, particularly supporting the tightening of rules for consumer testing around the world.\n\nWhile  efforts  in  passive  safety  undertaken  by  the  entire automotive  industry  have  enabled  extremely  significant improvements to be achieved in terms of reducing the road death  toll,  recent  technological  advances,  complementing public policy, have heralded a new and very promising area of  progress,  meaning  that  it  is  no  longer  a  case  of  limiting the  consequences  of  an  accident,  but  rather,  of  reducing their severity, or even, avoiding them altogether.\n\nThis is where primary road user safety comes into play, with ADAS (Advanced  Driver  Assistance  Systems).  These  ADAS can  alert  the  driver  to  danger,  assist  with  corrective manoeuvres or brake when collision is imminent, supporting the driver if he or she has failed to react. These systems, the most  typical  today  being  Automatic  Emergency  Braking (AEB), will be able to act on one of the recognised causes of accidents  to  reduce  their  occurrence  and  severity:  the driver's  delayed  reaction  due  to  a  lack  of  attention or anticipation.\n\n## Renault Group's ambition is to improve the safety of all its vehicles through driver assistance systems.\n\nFollowing  the  rollout  of  a  first  generation  of  ADAS  on  the Renault brand in 2015, the rollout was initiated on the Dacia brand  in  2021.  A  new  generation  of  ADAS  began  to  be deployed on vehicles in 2022. E-Tech Electric thus features a system that automatically adapts speed to the legal speed limit and the road surface, combined with lane centring, and an  automatic  speed  limitation  function  that  can  be  easily selected by the driver.\n\nIn  2023,  Renault  Group  makes  a  total  of  15,939  educational videos (14 languages and around 17 countries) presenting the features  and  technologies  of  Renault,  Dacia  and  Alpine brand vehicles, including ADAS, available to customers. This total includes the 7,970 online ADAS tutorial videos (Renault and Dacia BUs), i.e. around 50%.",

Renault  Group  is innovating  in  the  way  it  communicates  about  ADAS  by offering  immersive  virtual  reality  tools  to  explain  how research works for the benefit of safety.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## PROTECT with the LAB's expertise\n\nSince  1969,  Stellantis  (then  PSA)  and  Renault  Group  have been advancing road user safety with the LAB. It has made major advances in road user safety - knowledge of human behaviour  and  tolerance  levels  of  all  sorts  of  people  (age, size, gender, position, etc.) - and is helping manufacturers to design future technologies to increase safety for road users.\n\n## Thanks to the LAB, Renault Group has:\n\n- \u25cf Reinforced  front  impact  structures  and  integrated  pretensioning  systems  that  have  made  it  possible  to  lower shoulder  belt  tension  and  improve  the  complementary relationship between the belt and airbags to reduce injury risks.  Plastic  parts  that  may  be  in  contact  with  the occupant have been designed to limit the applied forces;\n- \u25cf Reinforced  side  impact  structures  and  integrated  side airbags protecting the chest and head. Plastic parts that may be in contact with the occupant have been designed to limit the applied forces;\n- \u25cf Enhanced  seat  and  headrest  behaviour  to  prevent whiplash in a rear impact;\n- \u25cf Improved  child  protection  with  Isofix  attachments  to properly position dedicated child seats;\n- \u25cf Modified  the  design  of  the  front  of  vehicles  to  improve pedestrian protection.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRESCUE with the Rescue Code, the Rescue Sheet and Fireman Access, free training for rescue workers and vehicle donations to firefighters\n\n## When  it  comes  to  rescue, the  'golden  hour'  is  the  one-hour time limit for saving lives. The challenge is, therefore, to save time, to facilitate the work of rescue teams during an accident.\n\nFormalising  a  long-standing  relationship  with  firefighters (2010),  Renault  Group  works  regularly  in  France  with  the General Directorate of Civil Security and Crisis Management (DGSCGC)  and  with  the  French  National  Federation  of Firefighters  (FNSPF).  As  the  only  manufacturer  to  be  a member  of  the  World  Rescue  Organisation  (WRO),  a committed  partner  of  the  NGO  Pompiers  de  l'Urgence Internationale (PUI) and regularly working with firefighters in 19  countries  around  the  world  to  better  understand  their needs  and  facilitate  their  work  in  the  field,  Renault  Group has  built a unique  collaboration  with  the  world  of\n\nFinancial\n\nstatements\n\nAnnual general meeting\n\n## Sustainable development\n\nInternational Emergency Relief. It can be seen in, in addition to other actions, the donation of several hundred overhauled  vehicles  per  year  dedicated  to  road  rescue training  and  the  choice  to  integrate  into  the  Group's engineering staff a full-time lieutenant colonel of firefighters  to  support  the  project  teams  and  to  provide dedicated  training  to  fellow  firefighters.  This  unique collaboration has been ongoing since 2017.\n\nFireman Access makes it easier for firefighters to deal with battery  fires  in  electric  and  plug-in  hybrid  vehicles.  The battery fire is extinguished after 10 minutes instead of more than 2 hours on a high-voltage battery not equipped with it. Fireman  Access  is  a  heat-meltable  part  placed  on  the chassis of an electric vehicle that, in the event of a malicious vehicle fire, allows the jet from the fireman's hose to access the inside of the high-voltage battery. The aim is to cool the battery  by  filling  it  with  water.  This  system  also  allows firefighters to save thousands of litres of water for this type of operation.\n\n## Renault  Group  is  currently  the  only  carmaker  to  offer  this technical solution to firefighters.\n\nAnother choice in favour of the safety of responders after a serious  accident: the  Service  Plus , the  traction  battery disconnection  system  (HT),  is  positioned  directly  on  the battery to guarantee complete electrical safety for all those involved, including emergency services.\n\nAnother  system  dedicated  solely  to  emergency  services  is now installed  in  the  factory  on  our  vehicles.  The 'QRescue' QR code on the windscreen and rear window of our vehicles allows  firefighters  to  immediately  identify  the  model  of  a vehicle  involved  in  an  impact  at  the  accident  site  and  gives access to the rescue sheet, which provides useful information on  the  architecture  and  systems  that  can  impact  them  in their efforts. In the event of a serious accident, this speeds up passenger assistance by nearly 15 minutes and increases the chances of survival of victims by 50%.\n\n## Closer look at actions in 2023:\n\n- \u25cf Monitoring  and  ensuring  that  engineering  takes  into account the first design rules for emergency firefighters on our hybrid and electric vehicles, to guarantee the best position  of  the  Service  Plug  (see  paragraph  above)  and Fireman Access (as above) on the Group's future electric and  hybrid  vehicles.  Emergency  service  needs  are  thus taken into account from the design stage of vehicles. For example, Fireman Access is already integrated into all our electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles;\n- \u25cf Systematic  factory  installation  of  QRescue  on  five  new Renault  models  and  deployment  of  the  Rescue  Code  in after-sales for vehicles already sold and not yet equipped;\n- \u25cf Systematic  verification  of  the  appropriate  performance of  our  electric  and  hybrid  vehicles  in  collaboration  with Yvelines firefighters;\n- \u25cf Creation  and  systematic  verification  of  Rescue  Sheets produced  in  22  languages  for  each  new  vehicle  in  our range  in  collaboration  with  the  firefighters  of  Yvelines, mandated  by  the  French  Ministry  of  the  Interior.

The communicating vehicle is  connected  to  other  vehicles,  to  the  road  and  to  the environment.  Vehicles  exchange  information  on  their location, speed, planned route, etc. They act as sensors for other vehicles: traffic sensors, road difficulties sensors, etc. The information collected is used in the first place to offer safety  services  (alert  of  incidents  upstream  of  the  route, road  areas  with  specific  hazards,  etc.)  as  well  as  traffic services (congestion, real-time secondary routes, etc.).\n\nVehicle  autonomy  is  being  phased  in,  starting  with  partial or conditional autonomy depending on the driving situations envisaged.\n\nClearly, one of the main challenges is to ensure the safety of all  users  on  roads  that  are  increasingly  connected  and automated.  Renault  Group  therefore  collaborates  with  the scientific community, industrial partners and public authorities on all aspects of safety:\n\n- \u25cf dependability;\n- \u25cf general product safety;\n- \u25cf regulatory compliance (technical and Highway code);\n- \u25cf compliance with the European Statement of Principles on Human-Machine Interface;\n- \u25cf development of international norms and standards;\n- \u25cf definition  of  possible  applications  for  connectivity  and automation services compatible with planned or foreseeable usage, including any potential distractions;\n- \u25cf compliance with the laws on personal data records.\n\nThe goal is to demonstrate this safety through six types of experiments,  to  test  and  validate  the  performance  and safety of the services and technical solutions, ranging from basic operational tests using test facilities and simulations to  'large  scale'  tests  of  the  service  on  authorised  open roads, including operational tests on test tracks.\n\nPartially automated Level 2 vehicles are widely deployed in the  range  with  functionalities  that  aim  to  improve  driving comfort  and  safety  such  as  contextual  cruise  control (adapts speed to the legal speed and road geometry).\n\nRenault  Group  is  fully  involved  in  the  French  collaborative programme SAM for Safety and Acceptability of Autonomous Driving  and  Mobility,  which  brings  together  a consortium of industrial and research players and regional partners  (see  2.3.1.1).  This  programme  is  in  response  to  the EVRA (Experimentation of Autonomous Road Vehicles) call for  projects  launched  by  the  ADEME  (French  Agency  for Ecological Transition) in connection with the Investing in the Future (PIA) programme in June 2018. The project started in July  2019,  and  its  analysis  and  dissemination  phase  will  be finalised in 2024.\n\nThis programme enables autonomous vehicle experiments to  be  carried  out  and  contributes  to  the  creation  of  a common  asset  for  capitalising  on  the  driving  scenarios necessary for their validation.",

We  place  compliance  with  product  safety laws  and  regulations  at  the  heart  of  our  concerns, regardless of the country of sale.\n\nWe have robust processes and rules to meet product safety requirements.\n\nThe company's commitment to product safety includes the following principles:\n\n- \u25cf Market only safe products and services: Renault Group is committed to ensuring that all the products and services it markets are safe for its customers and stakeholders.\n- \u25cf Product  and  service  monitoring: Once  a  product  or service is on the market, Renault Group actively monitors it in order to quickly identify any potential safety issues.\n- \u25cf Responding  to  safety  concerns: If  a  product  or  service proves  to  be  insufficiently  safe,  Renault  Group  will  take immediate and appropriate measures.\n- \u25cf Informing  customers  about  potential  safety  risks: The company considers it fundamentally important to inform customers  of  any  safety  risks  associated  with  using  its products and services.\n\nEach Renault Group function is  responsible  for  implementing and maintaining the processes, rules and resources necessary to  ensure  the  safety  of  its  products  and  services.  Each employee  must  implement  these  processes,  rules  and resources under the supervision of their line manager.\n\n## Governance/Organisation\n\nRenault Group's governance and organisation are crucial to ensuring  product  safety.  A  clear,  formalised  and  shared governance  structure  is  in  place  across  the  company, emphasising  the  importance  of  safety.  This  structure ensures that security considerations are integrated into all decision-making processes and operations.\n\nProduct safety governance is based on four pillars:\n\n- \u25cf A  strategic  expertise  network is set  up  to  define regulatory  and  safety  requirements  in  all  areas.  This network is made up of experienced professionals working collaboratively in various departments and disciplines.\n- \u25cf Managerial  responsibility  for  product/service  safety: project  management  within  Renault  Group  ensures regulatory compliance and product safety by accessing the  expertise  of  various  departments,  which  makes  it possible  to  take  safety  into  account  at  each  stage  of development and production.\n- \u25cf Supplier  compliance: Suppliers  are  required  to  maintain an ongoing commitment to ensuring and demonstrating the  compliance  of  their  products  with  regulatory  and safety requirements.\n- \u25cf Independent assessment: An independent quality department, separate from the projects, has been set up to assess and monitor safety-related processes.\n\nSustainable development\n\n## Holistic approach\n\nRenault  Group  takes  a  holistic  approach  that  ensures  that safety  considerations  are  integrated  into  all  areas of  the company,  from  design  to  production  to  after-sales .  Renault Group has a reference database of adverse customer events considered  as  potentially  safety-related  by  the  company. These events are systematically taken into account throughout  the  vehicle's  life  cycle . Technical  reviews  and internal  audits  are  organised  to  ensure  that  the  objective  as recommended in ISO 26262 is achieved. Safety documentation is created for each project, covering engineering, manufacturing,  sales  and  after-sales.  This  documentation  is created  and  validated  according  to  specific  rules  and processes and signed by the project manager.\n\n## Safety standards and regulations\n\nRenault  Group  ensures  that  its  vehicles  meet  safety standards and market practices. The experts contribute to the development of safety standards such as ISO 26262 and ISO 21448 for functional safety and ADAS or ISO CD TS5083 for  automated  driving  systems.  The  Group  also  follows standards  such  as  IEC  61851-1,  IEC  61851-23  for  charging electric  vehicles,  ISO  6469-3  for  the  electrical  safety  of electric vehicles and C18-550 for the prevention of electrical risks during maintenance.\n\n## Safety research and development\n\nSafety  research  and  development  (R&D)  is  a  fundamental aspect  of  Renault  Group's  commitment  to  continuous improvement and innovation. The company recognises that investing  in  R&D  is  essential  to  remain  at  the  forefront  of emerging  technologies  in  the  automotive  market  and  to ensure the highest level of safety in its vehicles.\n\n- \u25cf External  collaborations: To  carry  out  R&D  initiatives, Renault  Group  collaborates  with  external  laboratories and  research  institutes,  including,  but  not  limited  to, through  partnerships  with  academic  institutions  and various collaborations. These collaborations allow Renault Group to draw on the expertise and knowledge of outside experts in the field of safety research.\n- \u25cf Preliminary  stages  of  product  development: One  of  the areas of focus for R&D is the proactive consideration of safety  during  the  early  stages  of  product  development. Renault  Group  integrates  these  considerations  into  the design  and  development  processes  of  its  vehicles, ensuring  that  safety  is  an  integral  part  of  the  overall product concept.\n- \u25cf Conferences and standardisation bodies: Renault Group actively  participates  in  industrial  groups,  conferences and  standardisation  bodies,  such  as  the  Intelligent Transport  System  (ITS),  the  Lambda  Mu  congress,  the Pegasus Expert Workshop and the International Electrotechnical  Commission  (IEC).  In  addition,  Renault Group  maintains  partnerships  with  higher  education institutions and  welcomes  apprentice  engineers  or doctoral  students  to  work  on  innovative  research subjects (see section 1.4 and 2.3.1.1).\n\nI\n\n02",

This  process  ensures  that  all  identified  security  issues  are thoroughly  investigated  and  that  appropriate  action  is taken  to  address  them.  This  includes  managing  recall campaigns and information for customers.\n\n## 1.

Renault  Group ensures that the technical solution to the safety problem is quickly  implemented  on  all  affected  vehicles  thanks  to  a dedicated  Renault  Group  team  responsible  for  informing customers, notifying the appropriate authorities and providing clear instructions to the dealer network.\n\n## 2. Customer communication strategies and public reporting\n\nRenault Group has developed  robust strategies for communication with its customers to ensure that they are informed quickly and clearly of any safety-related recalls or actions through various communication channels.\n\n## Regular employee safety training\n\nRenault  Group  attaches  great  importance  to  training  its employees so that they have the skills and knowledge they need  to  develop  and  maintain  vehicles.  This  includes specialised  training  for  managers  and  a  wide  range  of product  safety  training  programmes.  By  investing  in continuous  training  and  development,  Renault  Group ensures that its employees remain well equipped.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn  conclusion,  safety  is  an  absolute  priority  for  Renault Group.  The  company  is  committed  to  holistic  compliance with global safety standards and market practices, rigorous testing  and  continuous  improvement  of  safety  measures. Through  its  global  approach,  Renault  Group  strives  to provide  its  customers  with  vehicles  that  meet  safety expectations to ensure both their safety and their complete satisfaction.  The  culture  established  by  Renault  Group  in recent  years  is  a  major  asset.  This  means  that  the  culture, values and safety principles promoted by Renault Group are fully integrated into the company's  operations.  The foundations of a strong safety culture establish a\n\nframework to promote a proactive safety attitude, prioritise risk identification  and  mitigation  and  foster  a  safety mindset among employees.\n\n## 2.3.1.3 Making mobility as widely accessible as possible\n\nIn  line  with  Renault  Group's  'Raison  d'Etre',  making  the heart of innovation beat so that mobility brings us closer to each  other,  three  levers  of  action  have  been  deployed  as social  innovation  for  mobility:  inclusive  mobility  solutions, investments and dissemination of know-how.\n\n## 2.3.1.3.1 Inclusive mobility solutions\n\nAlthough  mobility  is  a  key  element  for  the  social  and professional inclusion of people, millions of them nevertheless  remain  limited  every  day  in  their  travel. Penalised by financial, geographical and social hindrances, too many people have to give up a job or a training course quite  simply  because  they  cannot  get  there.  In  France, according  to  a  2019  report  by  the  Cour  des  Comptes,  'the main difficulties encountered by beneficiaries in accessing employment stem from the insufficient supply of jobs in the professional sector, a level of qualification that is too low (in almost  half  of  the  cases),  the lack  of  a  driving  licence  or vehicle (42%) , discrimination in accessing employment, and their financial situations'. In France, 20% of the population is in a 'precarious mobility' situation 28 .\n\nAs  a  major  player  in  mobility,  Renault  Group  therefore decided  to  act  for  more  inclusive  and  socially  responsible mobility  by  setting  up  a  social  business  programme  that aims to favour the mobility of the most vulnerable.\n\nThis concerns the development, with a viable entrepreneurial approach, of projects that have meaning for the  employees  of  the  Group,  its  customers,  its  distribution network  and  its  partners,  maximising  the  social  impact rather than the profit.\n\n## Qstomize: providing custom automotive solutions for everyone\n\nRenault  Tech,  created  in  2009,  became  Qstomize  in  2022, highlighting  its  expertise  in  vehicle  customisation  and conversion. Qstomize recently unveiled its 'Qstomize 2025: New  Ambitions,  Together'  strategy,  which  focuses  on expanding its product range and geographic expansion.\n\nThe Qstomize Business Unit designs, produces and markets conversions  for  Renault  Group  vehicles  and  its  partners' vehicles,  for  both  professional  and  individual  customers,  in compliance with the Group's quality standards.",

Renault  Group  is  the  only  European manufacturer  engaged  in  the  design,  manufacture  and sales  of  vehicles  dedicated  to  transporting  people  with reduced  mobility.  In  addition,  Renault  Group  has  been  a partner  of  the  F\u00e9d\u00e9ration  Fran\u00e7aise  Handisport  (French parasport federation) for nearly 20 years.\n\nQstomize also offers conversions for passenger cars, such as special series and driving school vehicles, as well as interior fittings,  protections  and  equipment  kits  for  commercial vehicles.  In  addition,  customised  layouts  are  available  for business fleets, meeting the specific needs of customers.\n\nAll  these  conversions are carried out at 13 production sites located  near  Renault  Group  factories  in  France,  Spain, Slovenia, Turkey, Romania and Morocco.\n\n## Caremakers: an inclusive mobility solution through a micro-loan offering\n\nIn France,  the  Caremakers  Inclusive  Mobility  offerings enable economically vulnerable people to access or remain in the job market by providing new vehicles and after-sales services (repair and maintenance) at special prices.\n\nFor example,  Dacia  Sandero  Essentiel  is  available  from \u20ac47/month for a resident of the Greater Paris metropolis with the conversion  premium  (or  \u20ac131/month  without  the  premium) through a lease-to-own arrangement incorporating a microloan taken out with one of our partners. In 2023, we opened our  offerings  to  the  Dacia  Sandero  GPL  and  the  Dacia Spring,  accessible  from  \u20ac77/month  (all  aids  combined) or  \u20ac128/month.  The  Dacia  Spring  offers  a  100%  electric driving experience.\n\nThese  offers  are  accessible  either  through  a  network  of prescribers (organisations, mobility platforms, social organisations,  employment  players)  or  directly  on  our website: https://www.caremakersmobility.com/fr.\n\nThey are valid in the network of Dacia and Renault 'Garages Solidaires', which are voluntary members of this programme.\n\nIn  2023,  nearly  1,000  vehicles  were  ordered  and  financed under  the  Caremakers  programme,  an  increase  of  more than  30%  compared  with  2022.  On  the  strength  of  the satisfaction  rate  of  this  programme  and  the  initial  very positive  results  of  its  impact  on  the  improvement  of  the professional  situation  of  its  beneficiaries,  Renault  Group  is committed to developing these offers in France and in other countries  and  is  aiming  for  4,000  LOAs  in  2025,  a  tenfold increase in volumes in five years.\n\n## After-sales: widely accessible spare parts\n\nAt  Renault  Group,  we  are  committed  to  making  mobility accessible  to  as  many  people  as  possible  thanks  to  our complete range of spare parts and our circular economy solutions.\n\nSince 1998, our range of original spare parts, equivalent to the original parts of vehicles in terms of safety and functionality, regardless  of  the  brand,  has  evolved  to  better  meet  the expectations of customers and markets. In addition, we offer an  alternative  maintenance  service  for  our  models  over four  years  old  in  our  network,  under  the VALUE+ brand .  This offering, exclusively dedicated to Renault and Dacia vehicles, is the  best  alternative  to  the  original  part,  offering  all carmaker services and warranties. We are also proud of our Motrio brand , which offers a range adapted to the needs of all brands over four years old. With more than 8,500 references spread across 70 different product families, our Motrio range is  compatible  with  50  automotive  brands  and  more  than 500 vehicle models. With a presence in some fifty countries around  the  world,  Motrio  has  even  set  up  its  own  chain  of multi-brand  garages,  continuing  its  international  expansion and  embarked  on  the  essential  path  of  digital  and e-commerce to stay in touch with its customers.\n\nAt  Renault  Group,  we  pay  particular  attention  to  adapting the pricing of spare parts to the change in the residual value of  our  vehicles  to  optimise  their  repairability.  We  have focused  our  efforts  on  the  scopes  of  bodywork  (bumpers, doors,  wings,  etc.),  glazing,  passive  safety  parts  (airbags, seatbelts, dashboard, etc.) and mechanical parts.\n\nFor  more  than  70  years,  we  have  also  been  practising 'standard  exchange' ,  which  consists  of  the  renovation  of mechanical parts and, since 2017, electronic parts. This offer is described in paragraph 2.2.2.2.3.5.\n\nAs a pioneer of the circular economy, in 2012 we created an after-sales  offer  of  reuse  parts  in  France,  anticipating  the obligations of the law on the use of parts from the circular economy in automobile repair. We offer 'skin' parts (bonnet, wings,  optics,  etc.)  and  mechanical  parts  for  reuse.  These parts are collected and selected from the network of INDRA approved  ELV  (end-of-life  vehicle)  centres.  This  service  is especially  of  interest  to  customers  whose  vehicles  are  not economically repairable using only new parts.\n\nTo  extend  the  life  of  parts,  we  are  developing  their  repair. They  are  diagnosed,  repaired  or  reconditioned  in  the workshop  or  in  dedicated  expert  centres,  then  tested  to ensure  that  they  are  in  good  working  order  in  compliance with  Renault  Group  quality  standards.  These  repair  offers also  concern  traction  batteries  for  electric  vehicles  and electronic  parts  (infotainment  systems,  engine  computers, dashboards, screens, electronic units, etc.).\n\nWe  continue  to  innovate  and  develop  our  offerings, particularly  in  new  technologies  associated  with  electric vehicles, to meet the needs of our customers and contribute to a sustainable future.\n\nI\n\n02",

Renault Group contributed \u20ac5 million to this company's capital. Caremakers Invest is a certified  Solidarity  and  Social  Utility  Enterprise  company (ESUS). The capital provided by Renault Group is increased by contributions from the employee savings funds through the Renault Caremakers Solid'air employee mutual fund.\n\nThe  Management  and  Investment  Committee  (CDI)  is  the central  governance  body  of  Caremakers  Invest  S.A.S., chaired  by  Xavier  Martinet,  the  Group's  Director  of Commercial Services and Director of Marketing, Sales and Operations for the Dacia brand. The CDI is composed of six members,  including  an  employee  representative  and  an outside specialist in investment and social business.\n\nCaremakers  Invest  S.A.S.  has  provided  funding  (capital  or debt)  for  16  projects,  appointing  Renault  employees  as mentors.  The  details  of  the  supported  companies  can  be found online at https://www.renaultgroup.com/en/ourcommitments/inclusion/caremakers-invest/\n\nThe companies supported by Caremakers Invest are asked to measure the social impact of their respective activities. A common  framework  of  nine  result  and  activity  indicators, put together with HEC, was deployed in 2018.\n\nAccording to the impact survey conducted in 2023, thanks to the products and services offered by companies supported by  Caremakers  Invest,  nearly  83,000  people,  including almost  than  24,000  people  in  vulnerable  situations,  have had better access to mobility.\n\n## 2.3.1.3.3 Participate in the influence and development of social business within the Company and outside\n\n## Social Business strategic expertise\n\nIn  October  2018,  the  Group  created  a  Social  Business Strategic  Area  of  Expertise  (SAE)  under  the  Sustainable Development Department with a view to embedding social business  into  the  Company's  strategy  for  the  long  term alongside  other  traditional  core  business  areas  (see  1.4.2.1 Expert  network).  Since  2022,  this  expertise  has  been attached to the Mobility & Transport Systems DES, helping to  spread  social  entrepreneurship  within  the  Group  by offering concrete business synergies.\n\nRenault  Group  collaborates  with  the  'Entreprise  and pauvret\u00e9' Action Tank, chaired by Martin Hirsch (CEO of APHP  -  Assistance  Publique  des  H\u00f4pitaux  de  Paris)  and Emmanuel Faber to share existing knowledge about social business, hold discussions with other businesses committed to  this  approach  and  benefit  from  expert  support  and advice with the aim of ramping up the project.\n\n## Flins inclusive campus:\n\nThe Flins ReFactory project has a training campus for circular economy  professions  designed  to  meet  the  skills  needs  of Renault Group  and,  more  broadly,  of  all companies developing  circular  economy  activities.  As  an  inclusive company, Renault Group is committed to making the campus accessible to people with reduced mobility or disabilities, and to promoting gender parity in its recruitment.\n\n## Collectif des entreprises engag\u00e9es: a prescription banking platform\n\nIn  2019,  Renault  Group  joined  the  'Collectif  d'entreprises pour une \u00e9conomie plus inclusive', a coalition of companies whose main contribution is our inclusive, supportive mobility offer through the Caremakers mobility scheme.",

Each  and  every  one  of  them  uses  their commitment  and  skills  to  make  mobility  sustainable  and accessible to all worldwide. Renault Group is committed to more  sustainable  and  more  responsible  growth  and implements  a  global,  fair  and  competitive  HR  policy.  HR principles, standards and processes provide a shared frame of  reference,  which  ensures  fairness  and  transparency  for all employees. To continue to adapt to transformed roles in the  automotive  segment  and  to  shape  future  mobility,  the Group  has  introduced  an  HR  policy  with  a  global  vision  to ensure  that  Renault  Group  as  a  Company  is  fast-moving, innovative, effective and eager to learn. This policy is based on  high-quality  social  dialogue  at  both  local  and  global levels and is focused on five priorities:\n\n- \u25cf be  sustainably  competitive,  while  complying  with  codes of  ethics  and  regulations  to  maintain  employee  health and safety;\n- \u25cf attract and develop all talent;\n- \u25cf implement  management  approaches  that  empower their teams;\n- \u25cf promote an inclusive culture;\n- \u25cf engage  our  employees  and  enhance  their  employee experience.\n\n## 2.3.2.2.1 Ensuring the necessary resources and skills\n\nAt  a  time  of  digital  revolution  and  the  emergence  of disruptive technologies at an increasing pace, the skills set needed  by  the  company  is  changing.  All  levels  of qualification are affected by these transformations. Moreover,  identification  of  talent  is  taking  place  in  an increasingly  competitive  market  not  confined  to  the automotive sector.

By bringing together key  players  in  lifelong  learning  (industrial,  academic, institutional),  ReKnow  University  designs  and  disseminates training  courses  focused  on  five  themes:  electrification  of mobility,  circular  economy,  data  &  artificial  intelligence, software and cybersecurity.\n\nReKnow University  also  relies  on  close  collaborations  with renowned academic and technological players to develop training courses leading to qualifications and diplomas. The E-Mobility Industry Academy (EMIA), which trains in Cl\u00e9on in the  production  of  electric  motors,  and  the  ICM  (Circular Mobility Industry) Campus in Flins, dedicated to the circular economy,  are  examples  of  this  innovative  method  of collaboration.  In  addition,  ReKnow  University  is  continuing its expansion with international development projects in the countries  in  which  Renault  Group  operates  (e.g.  Spain, Turkey  and  India).  Initially  dedicated  to  the  Group's employees in France, ReKnow University has already trained more than 20,629 employees since 2021 and wants to train 5,000 people outside of the Group by 2025.\n\n## 2.3.2.2.2 Ensuring the engagement and development of all talents\n\n## A. Supporting employees in their career and development\n\nSupporting  and  developing  employees  is  part  of  Renault Group's DNA. The Group offers everyone a variety of career and development opportunities so that they can grow and develop through their experiences and their possibilities for exposure and/or by training depending on their wishes and the evolution of the professions (70/20/10).\n\n## a)  An  annual  exchange  between  employees  and  their manager: the Career and Development Interview\n\nEach year, all employees are encouraged to reflect on their career development wishes and their individual development plan, which they share with their manager as part  of  the  Career  and  Development  conversation.  These items are formalised in the People@RenaultGroup tool.\n\nCareer development and individual development opportunities  are  also  discussed  by  the  HR  function  and managers at HR Committee meetings and at least once a year in People and Talent Review meetings. The purpose of these committees is to strengthen support for employees in their development.\n\n## b) Internal mobility: a key lever for development\n\nAt Renault Group, the diversity of experience is considered a key lever for development, which is why the internal mobility policy aims to place employees at the wheel of their career and development and give them autonomy in management. of their mobility and their career with Renault Group.\n\nThe  key  principles  of  this  policy  include  a  transparent internal  job  market,  optimised  job  change  times  and management involved from the definition of the job to the selection  of  the  final  candidate.  Adherence  to  these principles  is  the  guarantee  of  agile,  fluid  internal  mobility that embodies diversity and inclusion:\n\n- \u25cf search for diversity and complementarity of profiles and personalities within the teams;\n- \u25cf non-discrimination in the drafting of internal job advertisements and in the validation of candidates;\n- \u25cf equal opportunities through transparency in the publication of job offers and the priority given to internal candidates.\n\nI\n\n02",

It can also be an opportunity to  test  a  new  career  direction  before  possibly  proceeding with a mobility opportunity.\n\n## c)  Grow@RenaultGroup to guide employees in their career and development\n\nIn  2022,  Renault  Group  launched  a  new  digital  platform 'Grow@RenaultGroup'  to  guide  employees  in  their  career and development. In a single space, the employee can find advice,  tools  and  resources  to  get  to  know  themselves better, think about their future, build their development plan and  thus  prepare  for  their  discussion  with  their  manager. This  platform  also  offers  activities  and  concrete  ideas  for developing  through  experience,  in  contact  with  others  or through more formal training (digital modules, articles and books). In 2023, a section dedicated to managers was added to the platform. They find guides and tools to support their employees in their development.\n\n## d) Digital solutions: People@RenaultGroup and Learning@RenaultGroup\n\nSince 2019, the Group has deployed a digital solution called People@RenaultGroup  (Workday).  It  provides  employees with  feedback  tools  and  features  that  enable  them  to showcase  their  career  path  and  skills  and  formalise  their career aspirations.\n\nLearning@RenaultGroup  is  the  Group's  digital  training platform  that  allows  employees  to  develop  thanks  to  the training modules and e-learning made available to them.\n\n## B. Training to support skills development  EFPD5a\n\nRenault  Group  supports  the  skills  development  of  its employees  to  meet  its  sustainable  growth  and  social responsibility targets.\n\nThe priorities of the training teams for 2023 mainly focused on:\n\n- \u25cf Consolidating  the  Learning  &  Development  community within ReKnow University.\n- \u25cf Increasing  the  accessibility  of  the  offered  training  and improving the learner experience.\n- \u25cf Developing  new  training  practices  and  a  learning organisation.\n\n## a)  Consolidating  the  Learning  &  Development  community within ReKnow University\n\nThe  Group  is  further  developing  its  Human  Resources organisation by integrating its functional academies into its new corporate  university,  ReKnow  University,  by  2024.  The teams  of  the  functional  academies,  which  until  now  were part  of  the  Corporate  Functions,  are  gradually  being transferred to Renault Group's Human Resources organisation  to  contribute  to  the  development  of  the ReKnow  University  offering.  By  developing  greater  crossfunctionality of the training topics covered while maintaining close links with the Group's Corporate Functions,  this  organisation  will  also  support  the  new entities (Horse and Ampere) created as part of Renaulution. Our  organisation  also  relies  on  a  close-knit,  dynamic Learning & Development community present in 17 countries, which supports the deployment of this training offer in close proximity to the operational teams.\n\nIn 2023, a total of 2,519,196 training hours were completed by Group employees (permanent and fixed-term contracts) as of 31/ 12/2023.

This change  is  due  in  part  to  the  significant  increase  in  digital training hours and the contribution of programmes on Ethics and antitrust practices.\n\nThe training actions have been refocused on priority themes to support the transformation of Renault Group (training of managers, digitisation  of  activities,  new  tools  and  working methods,  etc.) and the upskilling of the teams  in technological  activities  essential  for  the  future  of  Renault Group  (cybersecurity,  data  &  AI,  digital  twin,  industrial metaverse, etc.). The commitment of the community of our internal trainers and our experts enabled us to deliver more than  one  million  hours  of  internal  training  to  our  teams, representing  nearly  50%  of  the  hours  of  training  delivered face-to-face in 2023 (and tracked in our training management system).\n\n## b)  Increasing  the  accessibility  of  the  offered  training  and improving the learner experience.\n\nThe  continuous  increase  in  the  rate  of  access  to  training within Renault Group is one of the key indicators monitored on  a  monthly  basis  by  the  training  teams.  Many  initiatives have been taken in the countries where the Group operates to develop access to training for Group employees.\n\nIn 2023, the overall training access rate was 85.8% (81.2% in 2022).  The  average  training  time  was  22.4  hours  per employee  (19.5  hours  in  2022).  Each  employee  trained received  an  average  of  26.1  hours  of  training.  These indicators are monitored on a monthly basis with the major entities  of  the  9  main  countries  where  the  Group  operates, representing  91%  of  Renault  Group's  registered  workforce. The  training  access  rate  in  these  9  major  countries  was 85.7% (81.6% in 2022).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAt  the  same  time,  Renault  Group  continued  to  develop  its training  management  system  by  making  it  easier  to understand  the  training  offer  through  rapid  access  to targeted training on important themes issues (e.g. managing  a  team  remotely,  improving  language  skills, anticorruption  &  ethics),  which  at  the  same  time  making  it possible to individualise training paths by allowing employees  to  choose  their  preferred  training  subjects.  A specific  communication  campaign  was  carried  out  to\n\nenable  our  employees  to  choose  the  training  topics  to  be prioritised at their level to offer them training that is always better suited to their expectations.\n\nA  new  programme  for  new  managers  was  launched  in March  2023.  This  training  cycle  includes  webinars  on  the fundamentals of team management, HR tools for managers, a  set  of  online  activities  and  a  managers'  club  run  on  the platform of our partner Team Bakery.\n\nI",

In  this  respect,  a  major campaign  to  promote  remote  language  training  was conducted in 2023 to promote language learning by a variety of  audiences.  The  vast  majority  of  more  than  15,500  hours were spent on the 'Essential' and 'Core' programmes.\n\n'Management  E-cademy',  made  up  of  eight  different themes  on  the  fundamentals  of  management,  is  now offered in English, French and Spanish (with the possibility of subtitling  in  most  of  the  languages  spoken  in  the  Group), which makes this programme even more accessible. At the end  of  December  2023,  the  number  of  registered  students was 3,797.\n\nIn June 2023, the HR teams in Spain launched a major initiative 'CONVI\u00c9RTETE  EN  PROTAGONISTA  DE  TU  DESARROLLO PROFESIONAL'  to  promote  access  to  online  training  for  all employees  of  the  production  teams.  (10%  of  the  blue-collar population had access to Learning@RenaultGroup in 2023).\n\n## c) Developing  new  training  practices  and  a  learning organisation\n\n2023  was  a  year  of  learning  organisation.  This  approach, exemplified by the creation of ReKnow University, was also supported  by  a  series  of  six-week  training  campaigns focused  on  lifelong  learning,  learning  styles  and  personal development of our employees.\n\nReKnow  University's  pedagogical  motto  of  'learning  by doing'  is  reflected  in  the  training  courses  and  initiatives developed  by  our  Academies.  The  E-Mobility  Industry Academy (EMIA), developed in partnership with the CNAM, Ing\u00e9nieurs  2,000  and  Next  Move,  is  evidence  of  this approach.  Nearly  70%  of  the  training  time  is  devoted  to practical  application  on  dedicated  industrial  equipment, coupled  with  regular  assessment  of  the  knowledge  and skills acquired during the course.\n\nThe  introduction  of  technological  innovations  into  our training  offering  is  enabling  us  to  support  significant changes  in  our  training  systems.  These  systems  offer solutions adapted to a variety of working environments. For example, training for paint teams at industrial sites includes the contribution of virtual and augmented reality. As a result, training times can be optimised, and material consumption can be significantly reduced.\n\nThe importance of distance learning (with the rise of hybrid work and the internationalisation  of  the  Group's  activities) also provides concrete solutions to support the upskilling of our teams and the transmission of knowledge. It also makes it possible to offer training courses accessible to employees based  in  various  countries  and  in  various  activities,  while strengthening the feeling of belonging to the Group.\n\nIn  particular,  the  'W-journey'  training  course,  designed  by the Group's Talent Management and Training teams in close collaboration with SKEMA Business School, helps to develop female  talent  and  support  women  in  taking  on  greater responsibilities.  This  6-month,  100%  online  programme covers  a  wide  range  of  topics  (leadership  for  women, understanding strategic issues,  and  managing your image and  communication).  This  course  includes  collective  work on  an  innovative  project  proposed  by  one  of  the  Group's Senior  Executives  and  collective  mentoring  of  each  class. Started in September 2021, this programme has already had 227 participants from 19 countries and all Group functions.\n\nOther talent development programmes (such as 'MBE Live', a remote programme organised by CEDEP) make up an offer that  includes  intercompany  training  and  mechanisms aimed at developing our female talent.\n\nIn collaboration  with  Software  R\u00e9publique,  a  training programme  promoting  collaboration  with  startups  was rolled  out  in  April  2023,  targeting  around  a  hundred employees from participating companies and incorporating feedback from international experts.\n\n## C. Preparing  and  developing  our  talent  and  leaders  of tomorrow\n\n## a) an international approach to identifying, developing and retaining talent\n\nTo  support  the  Renaulution  strategic  plan  and  in  a  highly competitive  labour  market,  Renault  Group  is  adapting  its Human Resources policies to identify key talent, accelerate their development and retain them for the Group ; the Talent Accelerator approach. It aims in all the Group's countries to:\n\n- \u25cf take more risk to reveal more talent earlier with a greater variety  of  profiles  in  line  with  the  Group's  strategic challenges;\n- \u25cf involve  and  empower  managers  in  identifying  and developing talent;\n- \u25cf better address new business needs.\n\nIn 2023, more than 6,000 talents were identified worldwide, for whom development actions have been defined.\n\nTo support the development of these talents, in addition to the  levers  and  tools  available  to  all,  these  employees  can benefit from complementary actions locally or globally:\n\n- \u25cf tools  to  have  a  better  knowledge  of  oneself,  become aware  of  one's  strengths  and  boost  one's  development and impact in the Group;\n- \u25cf participation in cross-functional actions;\n- \u25cf mentoring;\n- \u25cf coaching;\n- \u25cf training in leadership, communication;\n- \u25cf international transfers.",

To achieve this, Renault has undertaken actions which have made it possible to:\n\n- \u25cf increase  the  presence  of  women  in  the  Group's  highest management  bodies  (Leadership  Team  and  BMCs). This  percentage  increased  by  from  28.8%  at  the  end of December 2022 to 35.6% at the end of 2023 thanks to the management of internal appointments and a  proactive  policy  of  recruiting  women  (at  least  1  out  of 2 recruitments in 2022 of senior executives was a female). The objective is to reach 30% by the end of 2025 and 40% by the end of 2028;\n- \u25cf recruit more women in the Group: overall the Group aims to  have  50%  of  women  among  all  of  its  recruitments. At least one female candidate must be proposed for any position open to external recruitment;\n- \u25cf reveal more female talent through the new internal talent identification approach. In 2023, the proportion of women among  the  Group's  identified  talents,  who  will  be supported  and  developed  to  enable  them  to  take  up positions  of  responsibility,  is  34%  (+2  points  compared with 2022).\n- \u25cf support the development of female talents:\n- -the  Group  offers,  at  corporate  level  but  also  at  local country  level,  courses  dedicated  to  women  to  support their  development.  At  corporate  level,  two  flagship programmes are offered each year, made up of a mix of face-to-face  sessions,  intersessional  work,  personal development modules, workshops and mentoring:\n- -W-Journey is a programme,  organised  with  the collaboration of SKEMA Business School, supporting our female  talents  over  six  months  for  a  transition  from manager to leader. This programme has benefited 227\n\ntalented women since it was launched in 2021. In 2022, this programme received the 'Digital Learning Excellence Awards' prize in the 'HR and Management Challenges' category;\n\n- -Be Your Own Leader is a programme organised with the collaboration of the London Business School to enable talented women to release their leadership potential in order to be able to hold positions of high responsibility in the  Group.  In  this  context,  they  benefit  from mentoring  with  one  of  the  members  of  the  Group's highest  management  bodies.  This  programme  has benefited 87 women leaders since its creation.\n\n## D. Assess individual performance\n\n## a) From the focus on results to the inclusion of behaviours\n\nThe  Renaulution  strategy  aims  to  transform  the  Group  to become a technology and services company, which means transforming the managerial culture and strengthening the collective and collaboration.\n\nThus, professional behaviours become as important as the results  obtained  because  they  are  key  to  working  better together,  improving  and  strengthening  the  sustainable performance of the company.\n\nThe performance appraisal was reviewed in 2021. It is based on three principles: collegiality, shared criteria, and dialogue and feedback throughout the year.\n\n## b) Individual contribution: a combination of WHAT and HOW\n\nFor Renault, performance and individual contribution result from the combination of the following two criteria:\n\n- \u25cf The WHAT or the individual objectives ,  i.e.  the evaluation of the achievement of the objectives set in the year.\n- \u25cf The HOW or Professional Behaviours , i.e. the evaluation of how the results were obtained.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nI\n\n02",

It  is systematically enriched by a collegial assessment to guarantee greater consistency and fairness within the company during the annual  'People  Review'.  It  also  incorporates  information  from the  self-assessment that the employee had the opportunity to share before the People Reviews.\n\nIn  addition,  the  assessment  is  based  on  the  exchange  and dialogue  between  manager  and  employee,  during  annual interviews,  on  the  one  hand,  but  also  through  regular feedback throughout the year. The annual appraisal is the opportunity  to  look  at  the  results  of  the  past  year  and discuss the employee's contribution to the team's performance. Regular feedback will allow the manager and the employees to discuss the progress of the objectives and the professional behaviours observed.\n\nIf  results fall short of expectations, an improvement plan is implemented  by  the  manager  and  employee  to  restore  a dynamic to individual performance.\n\n## c) Feedback as a development tool\n\nRenault Group wishes to encourage the culture of feedback : a key practice for engagement, individual development and improvement of collective performance.\n\nThe  aim  is  to  create  new  dynamics  and  new  habits  of collecting and giving feedback by offering new opportunities.\n\nThus, employees can request feedback at any time or at the end  of  a  project,  from  their  peers,  internal  customers,  etc. Managers  can  also  collect  feedback  on  one  of  their employees  to  prepare  for  a  discussion  with  the  employee and  provide  support  for  the  employee's  development.  To ensure  the  quality  of  feedback,  materials  and  tools  have been made available to employees and managers.\n\nTo  make  it  easier  to  request  and  collect  feedback,  Renault Group relies on the functionalities of its People@RenaultGroup HR information system in Workday.\n\n## 2.3.2.2.3 A competitive pay policy  EFPD1g\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## A. Recognising individual contribution and engagement\n\nThe compensation of white-collar staff is based on:\n\n- \u25cf the level of responsibility . Positions are assessed according to their level of responsibility based on a work analysis  method.  This  method  has  the  advantage  of allowing  Renault  to  compare  its  employee  pay  with  the market  to  better  manage  competitiveness  and  the attractiveness of the compensation policy. The aim is to be able to recruit key skills and pay Renault employees at the right level;\n- \u25cf the level of individual contribution made to the company , assessed  through  the  degree  of  achievement  of  the objectives  set  and  the  behaviours  implemented  to achieve these objectives.\n\nThe  variable  portion  of  the  compensation,  intended  for managers and executives,  is  built  around  a  single  scheme recognising the performance of the employee, their area of activity and the Group in a spirit of solidarity;\n\nNumerical  indicators  are  used  to  reflect  the  levels of achievement set at the collective level.\n\nFor  2023,  the  Group  implemented  pay  increase  budgets reflecting  some  wage  moderation  in  several  countries. However, specific budgets are systematically maintained to reduce the gender pay gap in the countries concerned.\n\nThe  compensation  of  senior  executives  is  discussed in chapter 3.2.\n\n## B. Sharing collective results and contributing to Renault's development\n\n## EMPLOYEE SHAREHOLDING\n\nSince 2022, Renault Group has implemented a strong policy to develop employee share ownership in order to involve all employees  in  the  Renaulution  strategy  and  the  Group's future  performance.  In  2023,  for  the  second  consecutive year,  the  Group  renewed  its  large-scale  shareholding operation, the Renaulution Shareplan.\n\nBy making its Revolution and projecting itself into the future, Renault  is  not  forgetting  its  roots:  on  the  contrary,  it  is continuing the social laboratory tradition that has made it a unique company but bringing this tradition up to date.\n\nThis  unprecedented  operation  offered  each  eligible  Group employee:\n\n- \u25cf the free allocation of 8 Renault shares (offer rolled out in 30 countries), and\n- \u25cf the possibility of acquiring Renault shares on preferential terms (offer rolled out in 23 countries).\n\nUnder  the  subscription  offer,  eligible  employees  had  the opportunity to subscribe for shares at a 30% discount from the  average  of  the  20  stock  market  prices  preceding  the date  on  which  the  Chief  Executive  Officer  set  the subscription  price.  The  subscription  price  was  \u20ac26.28.  In addition  to  this  30%  discount,  Renault  Group  added  an additional contribution, capped at 8 free shares.\n\nAs in 2022, Renaulution Shareplan 2023 was a great success among  Group  employees:  more  than  95,000  employees benefited  from  the  free  allocation  of  8  shares  and  nearly 38,000 subscriptions were recorded, i.e. a subscription rate of 36% at Group level.\n\nDetails  of  the  Renaulution  Shareplan  are  provided  in chapter 3.2.5.3.\n\n## INCENTIVE POLICY\n\nIn  addition,  for  employees  in  France  in  particular,  Renault Group  applies  an  incentive  policy  that  includes  the redistribution  of  Renault  Group  profits  as  well  as  bonus payments for contributions to site performance.\n\nThe agreement of 19 April 2023, signed for 2023 and which was  paid  to  employees  in  March  2024,  includes,  as  for previous agreements, two components:\n\n- \u25cf profit sharing linked to the Group's operating margin;\n- \u25cf local incentive schemes based on site performance.",

A flexible organisation of work  EFPD2a\n\nBeginning  in  2021,  Renault  Group  voluntarily  deployed  a hybrid work organisation that is both flexible and innovative and now concerns most of the white-collar workers. As such, employees  around  the  world  are  offered  the  possibility  of adopting an arrangement combining a minimum of 2 days per week of remote work and a minimum of 20% of working time on site. The principles of hybrid work were materialised by the unanimous signing on 26 April 2021, of an addendum to the Global Framework Agreement of 9 July 2019.\n\nThis  agreement  is  rolled  out  worldwide.  It  provides  the general framework and allows for local adaptations to take\n\ninto  account  specific  aspects  related  to  the  activity  or culture of the country.\n\nThe  first  step  in  implementing  the  principles  of  the  2021 agreement is to determine eligibility for hybrid work on the basis  of  objective  criteria.  Participation  in  the  new  hybrid organisation is voluntary. For eligible employee categories, the  principle  is  a  minimum  of  two  days  of  teleworking  per week and a minimum of in-person work of 20% of monthly working time to maintain and develop the social connection with both the team members and the rest of the company.\n\nOn this flexible, simple basis, a very rich social dialogue has taken  place  all  over  the  world  and  has  led  to  local agreements  (e.g.  in  France,  Romania  and  Germany)  or  the publication  of  new  human  resources  policies  (e.g.  in  India, the United Kingdom and Brazil).\n\nThis profound change in the organisation of work has been accompanied  by  equally  important  changes  in  the  way people work.\n\nIn  addition  to  the  CO2  savings  and  the  reduction  of  road accidents  associated  with  the  limitation  of  business  trips, everyone recognises the benefits of hybrid work in terms of quality of life at work and work/life balance.\n\nRenault Group also welcomes the fact that meetings have become more efficient and that time is freed up for oneself and for more concentrated work. Finally, there are positive side effects of the hybrid mode on inclusion, particularly for international  teams  who  have  learned  to  work  better together in hybrid mode.\n\nRenault  Group's  pragmatic  approach  to  hybrid  work organisation,  based  on  trust  and  accountability,  has become  an  important  element  of  attractiveness  in  its employer promise around the world.\n\nIn  parallel with the rollout of hybrid working, the Group has put  in  place  a  strategy  to  deploy  new  Renault  Group workspaces.  The  aim  is  to  create  a  unique  workspace experience within the Group across all of its tertiary sites.\n\nThis experience is based on five pillars:\n\n- \u25cf a corporate strategy to drive transformation;\n- \u25cf collective intelligence to strengthen synergies;\n- \u25cf continuous improvement to increase operational excellence;\n- \u25cf financial performance to optimise our resources;\n- \u25cf business  experience  to  develop  our  attractiveness  and support innovation.\n\nThe  implementation  of  the  agreement  in France has resulted in joint discussions with the social partners on the signing of an agreement on new ways of working on 10 June 2021.  This  agreement  sets  out  the  main  principles  of  the global  addendum  mentioned  above.  It  defines  a  standard hybrid organisation of work formula with two to three days of  telework  per  week.  Furthermore,  it  establishes  the principle  of  the  evolution  of  tertiary  sites  by  gradually putting in place new dynamic workspaces.\n\nIn place  since  2021,  the  new  organisation  of  work  is evaluated  for  employee  satisfaction  and  improved  team efficiency. It also opens up opportunities in terms of the real\n\nI",

For  example,  'factory'  zones  will  encourage collaborative  work,  and  'library'  zones  will  facilitate concentration with silent zones.\n\nRenault  Group  complies  with  the  legal  obligations  and collective  agreements  in  terms  of  working  hours  of  the countries where it has operations.\n\nTo  preserve  jobs  and  adapt  to  fluctuations  in  automotive markets,  Renault  Group  has  instituted  a  system  of  flexible work time. It aims to find the best possible balance between the Company's interests and quality of life in the workplace for  the  employees  in  question,  through  consultations  with employee representatives and labour unions. The measures focus  in  particular  on  the  conditions  for  reorganising  work time,  such  as  by  adding  mandatory  shifts  to  meet  heavy demand or reducing work time when demand falls, notably by using individual or collective rest days.\n\nAt sites in France, for example, the average working week is 35 hours. In plants, the principle is two alternating eight-hour shifts with, in the event of spiking demand, the possibility to add a fixed night shift team.\n\n## B. A company that promotes diversity and inclusion\n\n## a) An approach that fosters community spirit\n\nThe  Group's  diversity  and  inclusion  policy  is  designed  to enable all  its  employees,  regardless  of  their  differences  or specific characteristics, to interact and work under the best possible conditions. On 2 July 2013, Renault Group signed a Global  Framework  Agreement,  'Committing  together  for sustainable  growth  and  development',  demonstrating  its commitment  to  promoting  all  forms  of  diversity  and eliminating  discrimination.  On  9  July  2019,  an  additional agreement was signed: 'Working together to build a Renault Group working environment' (see 2.3.2.2.6).\n\nRenault Group's diversity and inclusion policy is steered by the Diversity & Inclusion Department, which reports directly to the Group's Director of Human Resources. It works closely with  all  the  countries,  functions,  brands  and  entities  of  the Group  to  steer  the  diversity  and  inclusion  roadmap  and ensure its proper implementation.\n\n## b) Gender diversity within the Company  EFPD6a\n\nThe  proportion  of  women  in  the  Group's  total  workforce  is 22.0% at  31  December  2023,  an  increase  of  1.2%  from  2022 (20.8%).  The  years  2019  to  2021  are  restated.  They  exclude Russia and the Avtovaz Group.\n\n## Breakdown of women/men in the workforce over five years  EFPD1b\n\n<!-- image -->",

We  rely  on several  levers,  in  particular  external  recruitment,  mobility and  internal  promotions.  All  specific  HR  processes  are adapted  to  help  us  achieve  our  objectives,  and  each country, function, brand and entity has clear objectives, for example,  regarding  the  recruitment  of  women  or  the percentage of women among trainees and apprentices.\n\n- In December  2023,  we  expect  27.2%  of  women  in management positions.\n\nIn  order  to  ensure,  or  even  accelerate, their ability to move into these positions, all HR processes aim to ensure they are identified and trained. On this point, the Group offers women a range of tools to assist with their development (mentoring, coaching and specific training schemes), enabling them to fulfil their potential and demonstrate their leadership.\n\nThe  Group  thus  offers  various  development  programmes dedicated to women (see 2.3.2.2.2.C.b).\n\n## c) Anti-discrimination   EFPD6c\n\nThe  Group  has  a  proactive  anti-discrimination  policy:  zerodiscrimination policy, review of whistleblowing and investigation procedures,  common  system  for  monitoring  whistleblowing reports,  global  internal  anti-sexism  campaign,  awarenessraising and  engagement  mechanism  at  each  site,  and implementation of zero-discrimination advisors at each site.\n\nIn addition, Renault Group has signed external commitments:\n\n- \u25cf the  #StOpE  (Stop  Ordinary  Sexism  in  the  Workplace) Charter in 2020,\n- \u25cf the UN Women's Empowerment Principles in 2022,\n- \u25cf UN  Free  &  Equal  standards  against  discrimination  of LGBT+ people (2020) and, in France, the Charte de l'Autre Cercle (signed in 2020 and again in 2023) for the inclusion of LGBT+ people in the workplace (2020),\n- \u25cf in  France,  the  #ManifestInclusion  Charter  to  promote  the inclusion of individuals with disabilities in economic life (2021),\n- \u25cf in  France,  the  Charte  des  50+  for  the  promotion  of employees over 50 (2022),\n- \u25cf the  International  Labour  Organisation's  Business  and Disability Charter (2022).\n\n## d) Promoting talent at all ages  EFPD1c\n\nRecruitment plans have made it possible to limit the ageing of  the  workforce  and  maintain  a  balanced  distribution  by age  group:  13.5%  are  under  age  30,  28.7%  are  between  30 and  39,  33.1%  are  between  40  and  49  and  24.7%  are  over 50 years old.\n\n## Breakdown of workforce by age group\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe  breakdown  by  age  group  is  calculated  on  the  global scope as of 31 December 2023.\n\nI\n\n02",

The  purpose  of  this  is  to  encourage  the professional  integration  of  individuals  with  disabilities, improve  their  employability  (recruitment  and  retention), challenge  preconceptions  of  disability,  ensure  greater accessibility,  adapt  workstations  and  provide  training  to raise awareness among employees and managers.\n\nThe employment rate for people with disabilities was 3.20% in 2023, a slight increase from the rate of 3.01% in 2022.\n\n## 2.3.2.2.5 Promoting the physical and sports activities EFPD6d\n\nRenault  Group  affirms  its  commitment  to  sporting  values and  associates  itself  with  national  and  international sporting  events.  Two  examples  since  2022:  Mobilize,  the Renault Group brand dedicated to new forms of mobility, is a partner  of  women's  rugby  and  the  main  partner  of  the women's  XV  de  France.  The  Renault  brand  is  a  Premium Partner  of  Roland-Garros  for  an  initial  period  of  five  years (2022 to 2026 editions).\n\nFor Renault Group employees, the CSEs of the establishments offer a wide range of activities, in particular through Renault Sports Agreements, or provide employees with a financial contribution to their annual passes. Sports halls  and  changing  rooms  also  allow  the  practice  of activities in the workplace, as in the Paris region on the sites of Lardy, Aubevoye,  Villiers-Saint-Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric,  Guyancourt (Technocentre) or Boulogne, but also in the industrial sites, in France and abroad.\n\nLastly, Renault Group is committed to helping its employees take  part  in  physical  activities  by  launching  sporting challenges (Call & Care challenge) by participating through the Entente Sportive in solidarity events such as the Course du coeur or sponsoring the company's participants in local running or cycling races.\n\n## 2.3.2.2.6 Social dialogue\n\nYear after year, Renault Group confirms its determination to use social dialogue to build a world of work in a constantly shifting  environment,  be  it  at  the  global  or  local  level.  This determination  is  reflected  in  particular  in  the  signature  of global  framework  agreements  that  make  it  possible  to reconcile the interests of both the Group and its employees.\n\nThe Group's first global framework agreement, 'Committing together  for  sustainable  growth  and  development',  dates back  to 2 July 2013. This agreement  between  the Management of Renault Group, the members of the Group Works  Council  and  IndustriALL  Global  Union  sets  out  the social,  societal  and  environmental  responsibility  of  the\n\nGroup. The signatories have committed themselves to five major lines of action:\n\n- \u25cf respect for fundamental social rights;\n- \u25cf social responsibility towards employees;\n- \u25cf corporate social responsibility in the areas where Renault Group operates;\n- \u25cf purchasing and relationships with suppliers and subcontractors;\n- \u25cf preservation  of  the  planet  through  the  reduction  of  the environmental footprint.\n\nThe Group's second global framework agreement, 'Working together  to  build  a  Renault  Group  working  environment', was  entered  into  on  9  July  2019,  between  Renault  Group's Management,  IndustriALL  Global  Union,  the  French  trade union federations and the other trade union federations or unions  represented  on  the  Group  Works  Council.  This agreement,  of  which  the  Group  Works  Council  is  a stakeholder,  and  which  in  October  2019  received  the  first prize for the most innovative collective agreement awarded by the Assises du Droit Social (ADS), aims to better prepare for  and  cope  with  permanent  changes  in  the  automotive industry  that  have  a  major  impact  on  the  labour  market, based on five levers:\n\n- \u25cf a dialogue on the changing working environment;\n- \u25cf a collaborative management system;\n- \u25cf a lasting commitment to inclusion;\n- -a work/life balance;\n- -adaptation of the working environment.\n- \u25cf An addendum to this 2019 global framework agreement specifying  the  conditions  for  teleworking  for  Renault Group  employees  was  signed  on  26  April  2021,  by Mr de Meo for Renault Group, the Worldwide Group Works Council and  IndustriALLGlobal  Union  to  provide  a framework  for  the  transformation  of  working  methods worldwide. It also responds to the expectations expressed  by  employees,  reinforced  since  the  health crisis, on the possibility of mixing face-to-face (in-person) and teleworking to improve the balance between private and  professional  life.  This  new  hybrid  organisation of work at Renault Group aims to get the best out of faceto-face  and  teleworking  activities  and  operates  on a voluntary basis. It is based on the following principles:\n- -more  flexibility  in  personal  organisation  of  work: organisation  of  the  week  between  telework  and  faceto-face work around a minimum of two days of telework per week and maintaining at least 20% of monthly work time in face-to-face work;\n- -empowerment  and  autonomy:  based  on  individual objectives, free organisation of work between individual,  collaborative  and  face-to-face  meetings with the team;\n- -respect for work/life balance: respect for the company's  working  hours  as  well  as  for  break  and holiday times (right to disconnect).",

The  Worldwide  Group  Works  Council,  a  forum  for responsible social dialogue  EFPD4a\n\nThe  Worldwide  Group  Works  Council  has  a  maximum  of 40 members:\n\n- \u25cf European Economic Area: up to 31 members;\n- \u25cf other countries: up to 9 members.\n\nIt is the  essential  forum  for  social  dialogue  at  the international  level:  its  members  regularly  discuss  major changes in the Group and its strategic orientations with the Group's Senior Management and operational departments. When an exceptional proposed decision has transnational consequences  likely  to  significantly  affect  the  interests  of employees, the Group Works Council meets as a European Works Council.\n\nIn  2023,  two  agreements  were  signed:  an  agreement  to extend  the  terms  of  office  of  members  until  the  plenary session in early December 2023 and an amendment to the agreement relating to the Group Works Council of 24 March 2016, dated 13 September 2023.\n\nChanges in the workforce due to the end of manufacturing operations in Russia, Brexit, the sale of Renault Retail Group points  of  sale  in  Europe,  changes  in  the  Group,  etc.  led  the Select  Group  Works  Council  to  examine  the  situation  and any  adjustments  to  be  made.  These  changes  were  the subject  of  an  amendment  submitted  to  the  Group  Works Council  in  its  European  configuration  for  signing  before coming into force.\n\nThis  amendment,  signed  by  almost  all  the  European members, ensures a more balanced representation of seats between the various EU countries and clarifies the rules for allocating thresholds.\n\nThe plenary session of the Group Works Council was held in person from 1 to 6 December 2023 in France after two years of  remote  meetings.  In  accordance  with  the  provisions  of the  amendment, it convened the new term of office of the Group  Works  Council  composed  of  32  members  from 15 different countries for a term of four years.\n\nThe  first  day  was  devoted  to  the  elections  of  the  new Secretary  and  the  10  Deputy  Secretaries  constituting  the new Select Group Works Committee.\n\nMr de Meo gave an introduction on the Group's situation and strategic  guidance  with  significant  time  for  questions  and answers. The agenda was built around the Brands (Renault, Mobilize,  Dacia)  and  the  Functions  (risk  management, organisation, engineering, industry/quality, human resources,  purchasing,  advanced  products/planning  and finance). The plenary session also included two presentations  following  up  on  the  global  framework agreements  on  Ethics  and  Compliance,  as  well  as  Health, Safety, Environment and Ergonomics.\n\nIn addition, the Select Group Works Council met 24 times in 2023: 14 information meetings, 3 follow-up meetings on the 2013 global framework agreement, 2 follow-up meetings on\n\nthe 2019 global framework agreement as well as 5 meetings to discuss the agreements mentioned above.\n\n'In  2023,  the  Group  Works  Council  was  very  active.  Part  of the Group  Works  Council's  activity  was  devoted  to monitoring the actions requested in the information notices/ consultations, in particular in terms of changes in sales and in the implementation of the Horse and Ampere entities. At the  same  time,  the  follow-up  meetings  on  the  Global Framework Agreements took place with particular focus on the  whistleblower  system,  occupational  health,  feedback from  the  Employee  Survey  and  the  duty  of  vigilance.  The Renault  Group  Works  Council  was  also  informed,  in particular, of the new Group global employee shareholding plan,  changes  to  the  terms  of  the  Renault/Nissan  Alliance and, in particular, those concerning purchasing management,  as  well  as  the  global  strategy  on  light commercial vehicles.\n\n2023  was  also  a  year  of  transition  for  the  Renault  Group Works  Council,  which  has  adapted  to  the  company's transformations through two negotiations. The first involved extending  the  terms  of  office  to  take  account  of  the  time required to create the new Horse and Ampere entities, and the second concerned the composition of the Renault Group Works Council itself,  to  clarify  certain  seat  allocation  rules and take account of all the changes that have taken place within Renault Group since 2019.\n\n2023 also marks the end of the term of office that began in 2019:  members  voted  in  December  2023  to  elect  the  new Select Committee and Secretary for the next four years.\n\nLastly,  an  in-person  plenary  session  was  held  in  early December 2023 with discussions with  Senior  Management and in particular with CEO Luca de Meo.\n\nThrough these rich and frequent exchanges and through its ability  to  adapt  to  changes  in  the  automotive  world  and  in Renault  Group,  the  activity  of  the  Renault  Group  Works Council  shows  once  again  this  year  the  extent  to  which social dialogue is key to the performance and transformation of Renault Group'.\n\n\u00c9ric Vidal, Secretary of the Worldwide Group Works Council.\n\n## B. Long-term convergence between Group performance and employee quality of life in the workplace\n\nRenault  Group  endeavours  to  offer  all  its  employees  an environment and working relationships that are favourable to their individual development and improve their quality of life at work.\n\nWorking  environments  are  gradually  becoming  more flexible  and,  by  improving  quality  of  life,  enhance  the performance of the Company.\n\nEmployee  feedback  is  one  of  the  key  elements  in identifying  the  focus  for  improving  the  quality  of  life  at work. In 2022, Renault Group adopted a new digital tool to collect employee  feedback  in  a  faster  and  more comprehensive way. With simple interfaces, the platform makes  it  easy  for  employees  to  participate  in  surveys while protecting the confidentiality of responses. Advanced functionalities on the analysis of quantitative and qualitative results allow managers and the HR teams\n\nI",

These  two surveys enabled us to draw up action plans to improve the well-being of our employees. These action plans were drawn up  as  part  of  the  well-being  and  mental  health  promotion committees set up at the various sites.\n\nThe prevention of psychosocial risks and the promotion of psychological health remain a priority for Renault Group. A support system has been set up to provide employees with the best possible assistance in a context of transformation. In France, it relies on occupational  health  services, facilitators  and  psychologists  to  help  employees  and managers live and organise their work.\n\n## C. Ongoing local social dialogue  EFPD4b  EFPD4c\n\nThe  deployment  of  Re-group,  which  led  to  the  creation  of Ampere on 1 November, and the ongoing implementation of the  new  agreement  for  the  metallurgy  industry  were  the main themes of the year in terms of social dialogue.\n\nThis intensity of discussions with the trade unions resulted in numerous  negotiations  enabling  the  establishment  of  the Common  Social  Foundation  for  all  the  French  entities  of Renault Group.\n\n## Social implementation of Re-group\n\nThe Group's transformation continued in 2023. After the creation of  Horse  on  1  July  2023,  which  does  not  directly  concern  the French sites, the creation of Ampere was a major challenge this year.  The  process  of  informing  and  consulting  the  bodies continued  throughout  the  year  with  regular  coordination concerning the progress of the reorganisation project, especially within the company's major business lines: engineering,  manufacturing,  etc.  Several  CECC  and  CSE meetings thus took place in the first half of the year to inform the elected representatives about these developments. Subsequently, several communication events were organised to inform management and their teams of these developments.\n\nThis project became reality on November 1. On 15 November, Luca de Meo shared the ambitions of this new entity during the Capital Market Day and with the elected representatives of the French Social Coordination Council, a new employee representation body created a few weeks earlier.\n\n## Deployment  of  the  new  Collective  Bargaining  Agreement for Metallurgy\n\nAfter six years of negotiations, the metallurgy sector, which includes almost all the Group's French entities, entered into an agreement that shook up the social standard applied in the company.\n\nThis new national metallurgy collective bargaining agreement (CCN)  was  signed  on  7  February  2022  by  CFDT,  CFE-CGC,  FO and UIMM.\n\nIt  comes into force on 1 January 2024, except for the social protection theme, which came into force on 1 January 2023.\n\nThe most structural changes for our organisation are those relating to job classification.\n\nDuring this transitional period, the companies must deploy the new classification system.\n\nSeveral consultation meetings in April 2022 made it possible to share with the trade unions the methodology that would be used for job scoring. This methodology, which involved all the  players  in  the  business  lines,  HR  and  the  trade  unions, was welcomed by all.\n\nThe  implementation  of  this  new  agreement  led  to  several negotiations, multiple joint committees  and  a  rapid deployment of the new job classification mechanism.\n\nRenault Group thus negotiated two agreements relating to social protection signed unanimously by the representative trade  unions  in  France:  one  on  supplementary  health insurance and the other on personal protection.\n\nRenault Group also decided to adopt a transparent stance and to communicate proactively with employees on the new provisions  associated  with  this  major  transformation,  in particular with regard to job classification.\n\n## The French Common Social Foundation\n\nThe changes in the Group's organisation, coupled with the implementation of the new collective agreement, led to the signing of a method agreement providing the structure for the  themes  and  scope  of  the  future  Common  Social Foundation on 27 July 2022.\n\nThe  negotiation  programme  is  proceeding  as  agreed  in the method agreement, and the Common Social Foundation already  includes  six  agreements,  three  of  which  were signed  unanimously  by  the  representative  trade  unions  at Group  level:  supplementary  health  insurance,  personal protection,  seniority,  pay  structure,  professional  equality and social dialogue .\n\nThe agreement on Social Dialogue , signed on 11 September 2023,  is  a  major  element  in  structuring  social  dialogue  and coordinating bodies as part of the Group's transformations. A  new  body  has  thus  been  set  up:  the  French  Social Coordination  Council  (Conseil  de  Coordination  Sociale France), which covers all the Group's French entities.\n\nLastly,  two  additional  negotiations  of  the  Common  Social Foundation  were  concluded  at  the  end  of  2023  and January  2024:  one  on  disability  and  one  on  individual relations and organisation of work.\n\nThe  common  social  foundation  is  thus  made  up  of  eight agreements structuring social life within the Renault Group.\n\nInternationally ,  there  were  a  number  of  fruitful  exchanges with local social partners, particularly in connection with the Horse and Ampere projects and measures to make working hours  more  flexible.  Several  countries  (Spain,  Slovenia, Morocco, etc.) have taken specific measures in this area.",

The  company  thus marked its civic approach of supporting the spirit of defence and  fulfilled  its  commitment  to  the  Nation  by  recognising that of its reservists.\n\nSustainable development\n\nUnder the impetus of the Group's Defence Referent, in 2023 an internal network of reservists (3R for Renault Reservists Network)  was  structured  with  the  aim  of  highlighting reservists as levers of the Group's performance.\n\nIn a desire to continuously improve these exchanges and at the proposal o f the National Guard, in 2024, Renault Group is expected  to  sign  a  new  ag  reement  to  extend  the operational reserve to the National Police.\n\n## 2.3.3 For the development and vitality of the territories EFPD14b  EFPD14c  EFPD14d\n\nRenault  Group  is  a  major  player  in  the  economic  and  social development of the territories in which it operates. Present in 38 countries, the Company considers that it has a responsibility to  ensure  its  impact  on  the  regions  where  it  is  located  is positive  and  to  contribute  to  their  sustainable  development. The Group's ambition is to create shared value for the mutual benefit of the Company and all of its stakeholders. It therefore takes  care  to  identify  the  requirements  and  expectations  of the stakeholders that surround it (see 2.1.4.1) and to respond to them  as  far  as  possible  through  its  core  business  and  by setting up innovative solutions.\n\n## 2.3.3.1 An active participant through its core business activities EFPD14b\n\nIt  is  difficult  to  truly  isolate  the  Company's  contributions within a complex and interdependent socioeconomic tissue. Beyond  direct  employment  generated  and  taxes  paid  by the company, the other direct and indirect contributions and benefits are shared among the members of a sector.\n\nAccording to the figures published by the ACEA, the European Automobile Manufacturers Association, 12.9 million people -representing 7.0% of employees -work in the European automotive segment (direct and indirect jobs 29 ).\n\nThe  number  of  direct  jobs  totalled  2.4  million 28 .  This  includes automotive  manufacturing,  equipment  and  accessories,  and coachbuilders. Indirect employment includes other manufacturing  fields,  vehicle  sales,  parts  and  accessories, maintenance,  fuel,  leasing  and  transportation,  as  well  as construction and road maintenance and associated activities.\n\n## Renault Retail Group (RRG)\n\nThe Humanitarian and Social Aid Fund (FASH in French) was created  by  Renault  Retail  Group  in  2003:  it  arose  from  a collective agreement signed with the representative labour unions within RRG.\n\nThe  purpose  of  this  fund  is  to  grant  financial  aid  to  the employees of RRG and also to humanitarian action associations.\n\nThe FASH provides help and support for education, health, emergency food aid, aid to regain mobility, disability and the environment.\n\n## 2.3.3.2 Societal actions supported by a global network\n\nThe Sustainable Development Department leads, coordinates  and  relies  on  a  network  of  correspondents  in the main countries where the Group operates as well as on a dedicated committee.\n\nThe  country  correspondents  meet  every  two  months  to share local initiatives and maximise their contribution to the Group's sustainable development strategy.\n\n## Breakdown of social and societal investments (in value)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nI\n\n02",

Renault Group recognises that providing training on the careers of the future and giving the neediest access to knowledge are key to the development of society and also of the Company. Renault Group therefore continues to deepen its commitments in this area.\n\n## 2.3.3.3.1 Offering training in new automotive professions with ReKnow University\n\nTo support this transformation of the Automotive segment, we  created  ReKnow  University  (RKU)  in  2021.  This  new company university supports the transformation of mobility professions by ensuring the link between initial training and lifelong  learning  and  by  bringing  together  various  players (industrial, academic, institutional) (see 2.3.2.2.1).\n\nInitially dedicated to Group employees in France, the RKU's activities are gradually  being  extended  to  industrial partners in the sector with whom we share the design and delivery of professional training courses. By 2023, more than 10,000 Group employees received RKU training.\n\n## 2.3.3.3.2 Bringing schools into the corporate world\n\nRenault Group is committed to developing talent all throughout life, especially among young people, by helping them find their place in the world of work. Renault Group  develops programmes and initiatives to forge links between the worlds of  education  and  employment,  and  to  professionalise  and develop  their  employability,  with  a  particular  focus  on  the promotion of diversity and equal opportunities.\n\n## A. In France...\n\nIn 2023, Renault Group maintained its links with schools and young people, in particular:\n\n- \u25cf by hosting over 1,200 young  people  in work-study programmes  in  France  (including  1,153  apprenticeship contracts and 51 CIFRE training through research contracts) as  of  the  end  of  December  2023.  As  part  of  the  '1  young person, 1 solution' plan and its commitment to young people, Renault Group maintained its commitment to take on 5% of work-study  students  by  the  end  of  December.  Of  the apprentices present, 687 were recruited in 2023;\n- \u25cf by hosting 748 young people in internships;\n- \u25cf by  organising around  fifty events  such  as  conferences, school forums, 13 site visits for students from our partner schools, coaching sessions or round tables, led by Renault Group recruitment officers or school relations ambassadors;\n- \u25cf by providing financial support  to 106 educational institutions  and  approved  organisations  through  the apprenticeship tax. (for example, financial contribution to a seven-week pre-qualification SAS dedicated to a group of female job seekers, in partnership with Renault Digital and Ecole Simplon, as well as intensive training for Web and  mobile  Web  developers,  followed  by  an  18-month work-study training contract);\n- \u25cf by  helping  to  fund  a  two-month  training  programme  to familiarise 25 trainees who have been excluded from the labour market with IT and digital professions, with a view to  enabling  them  to  access  work/study  training,  and operation  carried  out  in  conjunction  with  the  Mission Locale des 3 vall\u00e9es.\n\nIn addition, Renault ElectriCity plans to recruit 700 permanent employees by the end of 2024 as part of a joint  initiative  with  local  employment  agencies,  the  P\u00f4le Emploi and all local stakeholders.\n\n## B. ...but  also  in  other  countries  where  Renault  Group operates  EFPD14d\n\nMany  employees  spend  some  of  their  work  time  teaching classes at different schools/universities.

In 2023, close to 200 students benefited from training or mentoring related to this initiative. Since 2014, the  subsidiary  has  also  supported  vocational  training  and has been involved in the development of future generations of automotive specialists. 350 young people from technological  high  schools  in  Mioveni  benefited  from  the 'dual education' initiative.\n\nRenault  Spain has  also  signed  several  agreements  and  is involved in various activities:\n\n- \u25cf Through  its  'Renault  Graduates'  programme,  Renault Spain is a partner of universities in the Castilla y Leon and Andalusia regions and offers training and internships to 26  young  graduates,  38%  of  whom  are  women.  84%  of programme beneficiaries are recruited.\n- \u25cf Renault  Spain  has  rewarded  five  projects  related  to sustainable  mobility:  two  proposed  by  students  through their  master's  thesis,  one  by  a  startup/SME,  one  by  a company and one by the public administration).\n\nWell  aware  that  knowledge  is  acquired  by  the  practical application  of  academic  knowledge,  Renault  Group  made numerous  gifts  of  vehicles  and  tools  to  schools  for educational purposes:\n\n- \u25cf in France , many  sites make  such  donations  for educational purposes to high school students in the areas where they are located;\n- \u25cf in Colombia , the  Foundation  donated  two  engines  to higher  education  institutions  (Pascual  Bravo  University and  CEFIT)  for  automotive  mechanics  courses,  enabling students to learn about Renault Group's latest technologies;\n- \u25cf in Spain , Renault  Group  regularly  donates  engines, gearboxes and vehicles to educational centres. This year, the company donated more than 60 engines, 150 computers, a battery, a gearbox, 4 projectors and other mechanical components to schools and training centres.\n\n## 2.3.3.3.3 Supporting access to education throughout the world  EFPD14d\n\nRenault  Group  conducts  a  large  number  of  initiatives designed  to  promote  inclusion,  access  to  education  and fight against student drop-out.\n\n## A. In France\n\nFactory  visits  are  organised  with  the  national  education system  to  develop  school/company  relations.  In  2023,  the three Hauts-de-France sites hosted more than 500 students of  all  profiles  (secondary  school  students,  general  and vocational high school students, engineering students, etc.). Unprecedented visits to the Maubeuge and Douai factories organised  for  the  families  of  employees  by  small  electric train were opened to local secondary school students.\n\nTogether with CORIF (an association with strong roots in the north  of  France  that  has  been  working  for  40  years  to promote professional equality and gender diversity and to\n\ncombat stereotypes and sexist representations), ElectriCity is increasing the number of actions and visits to its sites for the benefit of women seeking employment.\n\nFor  the  second  consecutive  year,  ElectriCity  continues  to invest in DuoDay to raise awareness among managers and all employees of the diversity of disability situations at work, but also to give individuals with disabilities the opportunity to  discover  the  industry's  professions  and  enjoy  a  new experience.\n\nTogether  with  the  UIMM  de  Sambre-Avesnois  ( Union des Industries et des M\u00e9tiers de la M\u00e9tallurgie ), ElectriCity is a  partner  of  the EDIVAL  association ,  which  aims  to  bring industry and the educational world closer together through personalised  educational  visits  to  industrial  companies. In  this  context,  the  ElectriCity  communication  team  has worked with teachers to develop educational materials for classroom visits (comics, safety animation and presentation of professions).\n\nElectriCity  also  supports the  Emergence  programme , the objective of which is to enable talented young people from modest backgrounds to pursue the studies they want (which are  often  long,  selective  and/or  expensive)  and  to  build  a professional  future  that  matches  their  potential  and ambition.\n\nElectriCity supports the Article 1 organisation (\u20ac5,000 donation), which aims to prevent individuals aged 16 to 25 from  working-class  backgrounds  in  the  Nord department from dropping out of school through guidance, success  in  higher  education  and  development  of  career paths to help them find employment.\n\nRenault  ElectriCity  is  a  member  of  the Fondation  du  Nord , which  supports  innovative  initiatives  for  inclusion  through employment,  support  for  the  most  vulnerable  people,  in particular  young  people,  and  the  independence  of  the elderly and of individuals with disabilities.\n\nThe  Le  Mans  factory  also  organised  13  visits  with  schools, and 100 pupils visited the Cl\u00e9on factory.\n\nAlpine launched the second edition of the Alpine Mechanical Excellence Competition .  This competition gives students  (high  school  students,  apprentices,  advanced student or professional technicians, etc.) in the automotive mechanics section from all over France the opportunity to showcase  their  skills  and  know-how.  It  helps  to  raise  the profile of the automotive engineering sector by positioning it as an area of excellence open to all. In its second year, with 1,524  entries  (up  37%),  the  competition  highlighted  the importance  of  young  mechanics  taking  part  in  such  an event. In addition to the experience gained through the trials and  the  opportunity  to  work  in  unique  situations  and  on unique  mechanical  parts,  the  moments  of  exchange  with the team's motorists during the regional trials or the finals allowed the candidates to perfect their know-how but also open up their personal and professional outlooks.\n\n## B. ...but  also  in  other  countries  where  Renault  Group operates\n\nRenault  Colombia , in  collaboration  with  local  universities, has  launched  the  'Germ\u00e1n  Camilo  Calle  Scholarship Programme' initiative.

At  the  same time, 23 of these students are being mentored, strengthening their academic and professional careers.\n\nIn 2023, Renault  Argentina supported  an  educational programme aimed at  offering  vulnerable  students  in  rural areas  the  possibility  of  obtaining  a  university  degree.  Our commitment  goes  beyond  financial  assistance,  extending to comprehensive  support  to  remove  obstacles  and promote their academic success.\n\nRenault Slovenia supports various associations with the aim of  supporting  students.  This  is  notably  the  case  of  FEJS (Forum  for  European  Journalism  Students),  a  network dedicated  to  the  exchange  of  journalism  students,  young professionals and citizens interested in the field.\n\n## In Brazil:\n\n- \u25cf 'Future  Generation'  is  another  important  vocational training programme developed in Brazil targeting young people  in  socially  vulnerable  situations.  This  free  sixmonth training course, intended for young people aged 15 to 24, is designed to prepare them for entry into the labour market. It includes courses in computer  science, management, citizenship, behaviour and civics. This year, 59 young people graduated and can now work in the field of mechanics or directly at the Renault plant.\n- \u25cf In  addition,  Renault  Brazil  sold  two  Masters  at  cost  to  the 'Casa  do  Zezinho'  and  'Lar  Mae  Marie'  organisation  to transport a total of 258 children during regular school runs.\n\n## In Morocco:\n\n- \u25cf This year, the Renault Morocco Foundation continued the renovation of a school in rural areas in the Tangier region.\n- \u25cf Since  its  launch  in  2019,  the  BIBLIOBUS  initiative  has established  itself  in  the  rural  and  suburban  school environment of the regions of Tangier and Casablanca as an  essential  educational  event  to  support reading  and cultural  learning . The  project  was  also  selected  as  a benchmark by the Moroccan national education authorities  for  its  high-impact  pedagogical  approach with a view to deploying similar initiatives in other regions of the Kingdom.\n- \u25cf In  partnership  with  the  'Jadar  Foundation'  association, 9  young  people  from  the  rural  municipality  of  Mellousa, near the Tangier plant, receive scholarships to fund their higher education .\n- \u25cf The Renault Morocco Foundation is also very involved in road  risk  prevention .  With  the  Tkayes  school  initiative, more than 10,000 children, 9 to 14 years of age, and their families  benefited  from  the  road-user  safety  education programme in 2023.\n\nThe  Renault  Romania  Foundation launched  the  website kilometrulbine.ro containing environmental education material, developed in partnership with the NGO Viitor plus.\n\n## 2.3.3.4 Plants in transition\n\nRenault  Group  has  an  industrial  system  resolutely  focused on the future, ready to meet the challenges of the market by offering  vehicles  that  will  define  the  next  era  of  the automotive industry.\n\nIn December 2023, Renault Group announced the launch of an  in-depth  transformation  plan  for  its  industry  to  support the Revolution phase of the Renaulution strategic plan, 'ReIndustry'. This transformation of the industry aims to make our system more agile, more virtuous and more competitive, which  will  also  allow  us  to  respond  more  quickly  to  our customers' expectations.\n\nThe 'Re-Industry' transformation plan reaffirms the Group's commitment  to  the  innovation  and  mobility  of  the  future, while ensuring sustainable activity at its industrial sites.\n\n## Women and men at the heart of the transformation\n\nRe-Industry  relies  on  the  Industry  and  Quality  teams  of nearly  65,000  employees  worldwide.  More  reactive  and trained  in  new  technologies,  our  staff  can  concentrate  on higher added-value activities.\n\nThe  supervision  and  increased  visibility  of  the  working environment offered by Artificial Intelligence allow players to gain agility and autonomy in decision-making. Technologies  from  the  gaming  world  are  making  user experiences more immersive. This is the case, for example, with  painting  training  carried  out  in  virtual  reality  even before the new model has gone into production. As another example,  AI  algorithms  facilitate  employees'  ability  to anticipate,  such  as  optimisation  and  flow  management functionalities for logistics chain experts.\n\n## A more competitive, flexible and environmentally friendly industrial ecosystem, focused on technology and data\n\nFrom October 2022, Renault Group was the first manufacturer  to  acquire  an  industrial  metaverse  and intends to stay one step ahead by further accelerating the digitalisation of its industrial system and strengthening the skills of its teams.\n\nWith 12,500 pieces of equipment connected worldwide, two million  pieces  of  data  fed  back  every  minute  and  three billion  pieces  of  data  every  day,  Renault  Group's  industrial metaverse is making it possible to produce smarter, faster and better, while reducing the costs and carbon footprint of industrial processes.\n\nConnecting  all  workstations  and,  more  broadly,  the  entire ecosystem (transport, suppliers, etc.) is a key factor enabling Renault Group to aim for a 60% reduction in vehicle delivery times  and  to  cut  the  carbon  footprint  of  its  vehicle manufacturing  in  half.  Artificial  intelligence  also  makes it possible to have a predictive approach in terms of energy consumption  and  contributes  to  the  reduction  of  the consumption  of  the  Group's  industrial  sites  by  20% (2021 v/s. 2023).",

Its projects, with its partners, aim to restore equal opportunities,  to  advise  and  support  vulnerable  people  in their efforts to access or return to employment. Since 2021, the Corporate Foundation and the World Foundations have supported 21,300 people.\n\n## Integration through employment\n\nThe Fondation d'entreprise Renault Group supports the most vulnerable  in  their  professional  integration  by  supporting projects of 34 partners, including 27 organisations helped on the following seven themes:\n\n- \u25cf driving licence assistance;\n- \u25cf post-incarceration integration;\n- \u25cf support for returning to work;\n- \u25cf entrepreneurship support;\n- \u25cf bridging the digital divide;\n- \u25cf first-time hiring assistance;\n- \u25cf support for entrepreneurs, following a business failure, in their professional reintegration.\n\nIn 2023, the Renault Group Corporate Foundation supported 4,292 people.\n\n## Employee engagement\n\nThe  Fondation  Renault  Group  responds  to  the  quest  for meaning among employees who wish to get involved.\n\nIn 2021, the Fondation d'entreprise Renault Group has set up a rounding-off programme enabling employees who wish to do  so  to  make  voluntary  donations  each  month,  deducted directly  from  their  pay  slips,  for  the  benefit  of  four associations: Les Restaurants  du  C\u0153ur,  l'Institut de l'Engagement,  le  Secours  Populaire  Fran\u00e7ais  and  Emma\u00fcs Connect. The scheme ended at the end of September 2023. Thanks  to  employee  donations,  the  Foundation  donated more than \u20ac138,000 to the four associations.\n\nIn  2023,  the  Fondation  Renault  Group  decided  to  involve employees in France more widely in the projects it supports through  a  solidarity  vote.  In  this  context,  the  Foundation partnered  with  Captain  Cause,  a  support  platform  for community  projects  with  a  positive  impact,  to  distribute  a \u20ac50k  donation  among  three  organisations  working  on\n\nthe company,\n\nthe capital and the\n\nshare ownership\n\nSustainable development\n\nintegration through employment : Witech, Tirelires d'Avenir and \u00catre.\n\nIt also offered its employees the opportunity to get involved in  the  'For  more  solidarity  at  Christmas'  operation  by partnering again with Captain Cause in December 2023. In a solidarity vote, the employees distributed \u20ac50k among three organisations  fighting  food  insecurity:  Cop1,  Solinum  and HopHopFood.  In  addition  to  voting  for  one  of  the  three associations,  employees  could  make  a  donation  of  an amount of their choice for one of the associations.\n\nThe  employees  are  also  involved  with  some  of  the Foundation's  partner  associations:  Solidarit\u00e9s  Nouvelles face au ch\u00f4mage, Time2Start, etc.\n\nFollowing  the  earthquakes  in  Turkey  and  Morocco,  the Fondation  Renault  Group  set  up  a  fundraising  campaign among  our  employees.  Thanks  to  the  generosity  of  our employees,  more  than  \u20ac100,000  was  donated  to  the earthquake victims, with a matching contribution from the Foundation.  The  Fondation  Renault  Group  also  made  a special \u20ac200,000 donation to UNICEF to help child victims of the earthquake in Turkey.\n\n## Art Collection\n\nThe Renault Group Art Collection is under the supervision of its  Corporate Foundation, whose mission is to promote the Group's Art Collection, which includes more than 500 works by some thirty major artists, and to make it accessible to as many people as possible.\n\nIn  2023,  the  collection  was  showcased  during  multiple  key events:\n\n- \u25cf lending of a preliminary study by Victor Vasarely for the 'L'occhio  in  gioco'  exhibition  in  Padua  from  September 2022 to February 2023.\n- \u25cf Vasarely  loan  for  the  exhibition  'Vasarely,  from  a programmatic art to digital' at the Lympia Nice cultural space from June to October 2023.\n- \u25cf partnership with urban artist G\u00e9rard Zlotykamien through an  exhibition  at  the  Mathgoth  Gallery  that  allows  the public to learn about the importance of this French artist in the history of urban and contemporary art.\n- \u25cf during the 2023  European  Heritage  Days  (JEP)  in Boulogne-Billancourt:  pictorial  presentation  by  street artist  J\u00e9r\u00f4me  Mesnager  on  the  Pierre  Dreyfus  building (exhibition  of  photographs  of  J\u00e9r\u00f4me  Mesnager's  Corps Blancs painted on the abandoned buildings of Ile Seguin, on  the  Pierre  Dreyfus  building,  installation  of  window stickers  of  photographs  by  Hubert  Fanthomme  showing the Corps Blanc during the demolition of the Renault plant on Ile Seguin on the Kinetic building).\n\n## Renault Group Foundations\n\nSix  of  the  Group's  countries  (Argentina,  Brazil,  Colombia, Morocco, Spain and Romania) run their own locally funded foundations.\n\nA  strategic  link  of  all  the  foundations  around  integration through  employment  began  in  2021  under  the  leadership and  coordination  of  the  Fondation  d'entreprise  Renault Group. This leadership and coordination continued in 2023.\n\nI\n\n02",

This includes, for example, the antitrust law compliance approach.\n\nThe  Ethics  &  Compliance  guidelines  are  accessible  on  the Renault Group Ethics & Compliance intranet. It consists of, among other things, the following elements:\n\n- \u25cf the  Ethics  Charter,  updated  in  2022,  which  reaffirms  the collective commitment to act according to values based on  trust  and  respect  between  employees,  customers, suppliers,  partners  and  shareholders.  It  encourages integrity and vigilance and applies to each and every one of the senior executives, managers, employees, apprentices and temporary workers of Renault Group and its  subsidiaries  worldwide.  Its  preamble,  signed  by  the Chairman  of  the  Board  of  Directors  and  the  Chief Executive  Officer,  states  that  senior  executives  have  a duty to set an example;\n- \u25cf the  anticorruption  Code  of  Practice,  updated  in  2021, which  reaffirms  Renault  Group's  zero-tolerance  policy with  regard  to  corruption  and  influence  peddling  and embodies our commitments in this area. It applies anyone with  an  employment  contract  with  Renault  Group, regardless  of  their hierarchical level, geographical location  or  reporting  entity.  This  code  is  a  decisionmaking tool that sets out the behaviours to adopt and the rules to be followed when faced with risks of corruption or influence  peddling.  Its  preamble,  drafted  jointly  by  the Chairman  of  the  Board  of  Directors  and  the  CEO  of Renault  Group,  demonstrates  their  strong  personal involvement and strengthens the scope of the document;\n- \u25cf the Renault Group anticorruption and influence-peddling management system;\n- \u25cf the eight codes of conduct, which detail the rules of good conduct  to  be  applied  in  activities  that  require  even stronger ethics;\n- \u25cf all the procedures for implementing ethics and compliance;\n- \u25cf the  whistleblowing  tool.  The  WhistleB  whistleblowing platform  is  accessible  from  the  Ethics  &  Compliance intranet  (through  the  D\u00e9clic  internal  communication portal) as well as from the Renault Group website.\n\nThe Ethics Charter and the Anticorruption Code of Conduct, translated  into  14  languages,  are  freely  available  on  the www.renaultgroup.com website\n\n## 2.4.1.2 Contributors and bodies\n\nThe  Director  of  Ethics  &  Compliance  (DEC)  is  in  charge  of Renault Group's ethics and compliance control system. The DEC meets regularly with the CEO to discuss deployment.\n\nThe  DEC  reports  on  Ethics  and  Compliance  actions  to  the Audit and Risk Committee (CAR), a specialised committee of the Group's Board of Directors.\n\nThe duties of the DEC are as follows:\n\n- \u25cf define the Group's overall Ethics and Compliance policy;\n- \u25cf act as an advisor to the Company's management teams;\n- \u25cf ensure  that  whistleblowing  reports  are  collected  and handled;\n- \u25cf chair the Group Ethics and Compliance Committee (CECG);\n- \u25cf promote  and  monitor  the  application  of  the  Ethics  & Compliance  rules  of  the  Group's  various  functions (purchasing,  production,  sales,  engineering,  finance, HR, etc.);\n- \u25cf update the Group's Ethics & Compliance system, particularly in the event of new requirements or new regulations;\n- \u25cf deploy  the  Group's  Ethics  and  Compliance  policy  on  a global scale.\n\nTo complete this mission, the DEC relies on:\n\n- \u25cf a team of 16 employees;\n- \u25cf Ethics  and  Compliance  correspondents  appointed  in  all countries  where  the  Group  operates.  They  ensure  the dissemination of guidelines, values and expected behaviours, taking into account local laws and regulations.

This  committee  is  responsible  for  validating, evaluating and improving the effectiveness of the Ethics and  Regulatory  Compliance  mechanisms  in  place.  It reinforces  the  protection  of  the  company  and  its employees in all countries where Renault Group operates;\n- \u25cf the Whistleblowing Committee (CTA) composed of seven members  and  three  experts.  It  collectively  deals  with whistleblowing  reports  received  for  France  and  the central  functions,  as  well  as  certain  warnings  issued directly to it by whistleblowers from other countries;\n- \u25cf the  Country Ethics and Compliance Committees (CECP). Each  CECP  is  chaired  by  the  country  director  and coordinated by its Ethics and Compliance officer. It deals with  whistleblowing  alerts  at  the  country  level  and ensures the local deployment  of  the  Ethics and Compliance policy and measures.\n\n## 2.4.1.3 Highlights of 2023\n\nMost  of  the  Ethics  &  Compliance  guidelines  were  updated during  the  year,  and  additional  procedures  were  created, including the 'Renault Group anticorruption and influencepeddling management system'.\n\nThe  Ethics  and  anticorruption  e-learning  courses  were renewed. A more dynamic format, translated into 14  languages,  has  provided  easy  access  for  all  Renault Group  employees  worldwide.  All  employees  considered  to be potentially exposed to these risks must complete these modules, i.e. more than 58,000 people. The 2023 completeness target of 90% was achieved.\n\nThe  theme  of  the  December  2023  edition  of  the  'Inspiring Ethics'  seminar  was  'Engineering  Ethics'.  Two  speakers were  invited:  Ron  Soffer,  international  litigation  lawyer, founder  of  Soffer  Avocats  in  Paris,  and  Eric  Salobir, Chairman  of  the  Executive  Committee  of  the  Human Technology  Foundation.  The  event,  broadcast  live,  is  also accessible on a delayed basis. This annual seminar helps to raise awareness among all Renault Group employees about Ethics & Compliance.\n\nInternal tools to promote and share the Ethics and Compliance policy  (newsletter,  intranet  site,  internal  kits,  videos,  posters) are updated regularly. They provide clear, accessible information to Renault Group employees worldwide.\n\nThe  digitalisation  of  processes  continues,  in  particular  to map  risks  of  corruption,  deal  with  situations  of  conflict  of interest or declare gifts, invitations or business meals.\n\nThe procedures for handling alerts and the operation of the whistleblowing committee have been updated and distributed  to  all  correspondents.  They  are  posted  on  the Ethics & Compliance intranet.\n\nIn addition,  the  whistleblowing  platform  is  now  also accessible from the Renault Group website.\n\n## The Ethics & Compliance network\n\nThe  Ethics  &  Compliance  network  has  been  further strengthened.  It  consists  of  more  than  100  employees. It  deploys  and  coordinates  the  Ethics  &  Compliance  policy locally for all Corporate Functions, brands and countries.\n\nThe  Group  Ethics  &  Compliance  Department  regularly manages  this  network  by  relying  on,  among  other  things, monthly  meetings,  newsletters  and  an  annual  seminar.  It also provides communication kits to help it roll out the Ethics and Compliance guidelines for all Renaut Group employees. It  also  identifies  best  practices  and  ensures  that  they  are adopted by the network.\n\n## Deployment of the corruption and influencepeddling prevention plan  EFPD16b\n\nPursuant  to  the  'Sapin  II'  law  of  9  December  2016,  on transparency, the fight against corruption and the modernisation  of  economic  life,  the  Group  continues  to strengthen its overall system for preventing and detecting corruption and influence-peddling. The actions undertaken include but are not limited to:\n\n- 1. The Renault Group anticorruption and influence-peddling management system, which defines  the  organisation  of each  pillar  of  the  Sapin  2  law  and  the  way  in  which interactions between pillars are handled.\n- 2. The mapping work begun in 2022 continues as the Group evolves.  The  2023  summary  of  the  risk  assessment  and local action plans was sent to the Leadership Team.\n- 3. The Third-Party Integrity Management Process has been rolled out in the Group's main subsidiaries.\n- 4. The training programme dedicated to business ethics was renewed in 2023. This programme includes three e-learning modules. Each of these modules is available in 14 languages to make it easier for our employees worldwide to  access  and  understand  them.  The  first  e-learning session  on  'Conflicts  of  interest'  was  completed  by  all potentially exposed employees who had not completed it by  31  December  2021,  i.e. 51,451 people  or 91% of  the assigned population. The second module on 'Ethics within Renault  Group'  was  completely  revised  and  updated.  It was  completed  by 52,551 employees,  i.e. 93% . The 'anticorruption'  e-learning  module  was  also  revised  and updated. It was completed by 52,606 employees ( 92% ).\n- 5. The Global Whistleblowing System, available in 15  languages  and  operational  in  all  the  countries,  is managed locally by the 'ethics and compliance' officers. It  allows current and former Group employees as well as external  and  occasional  collaborators,  suppliers,  job applicants, and shareholders to submit alerts directly to",

In particular, it is accessible  confidentially  at  any  time  through  an external platform from a computer, tablet or smartphone, whether  professional  or  personal.  At  the  global  level, 568 new alerts were logged in 2023. Of the closed cases, after  investigation,  29%  were  confirmed,  with  the  main causes being psychological harassment, unethical behaviour and fraud.\n\n- 6. The  second-level  control  specific  to  the  anticorruption action  plan,  strengthened  in  2023,  is  carried  out, depending  on  the  subject,  by  the  Internal  Control Department and by the Ethics and Compliance Department's  Delegated  Compliance  Department.  The controls relating to the procedures related to 'sponsorship', 'image partnership', 'internal alert system'  and  'mapping  of  corruption  and  influencepeddling risks' were thus carried out.\n- 7. In 2023, the Group Compliance Department continued to carry  out  a  self-assessment  on  the  rollout  of  the corruption prevention system in the Group's entities and subsidiaries. This CCQ (Compliance Control Questionnaire) received input from 30 entities, countries or Departments  in  France.  Compliance  tests  were conducted on 14 entities of countries to verify the quality of the responses and thus confirm the overall results.\n\nSustainable development\n\n## Compliance with laws, regulations and corporate rules\n\nThe  Group  Ethics  and  Compliance  Committee  (CECG)  is responsible  for  monitoring  the  Group's  compliance  with laws and regulations.\n\nThe Group Ethics and Compliance Department is responsible  for  overseeing  regulatory  compliance.  The Legal  Department  and  the  Risk  Management  Department provide support and assistance on this subject.\n\nThere is a method to assess existing procedures, validated by the CECG. The Group Ethics and Compliance Department applies  this  method  to  a  list  of  regulatory  areas  selected with  the  Legal  Department.  The  assessment  results  in  a quantitative indicator: the Regulatory Compliance Maturity Index (IMCR). In parallel with this assessment, a rating of the seriousness  of  the  risk  of  regulatory  non-compliance  is established  with  each  prescribing  department  (see  'Risk factors', chapter 4.2).\n\nThe  system  as  a  whole  is  managed  by  the  internal monitoring procedure for regulatory compliance.\n\n## 2.4.2 Strengthening the responsible purchasing approach in the supply chain  EFPD14a EFPD15a  EFPD15b  EFPD17  EFPD18\n\nThe Group also extends its social, societal and environmental responsibility to its relationships with suppliers. Renault Group implements a responsible purchasing policy throughout its entire supply chain.\n\nWith  regard  to  suppliers  with  whom  the  Group  has  an established commercial relationship, the responsible purchasing approach is detailed in Renault Group's Vigilance Plan, set out in section 2.5.5 of this Document, including:\n\n- \u25cf A  mapping  of  risks,  accompanied  by  methodology information (2.5.5.1);\n- \u25cf Procedures  for  regularly  assessing  the  situation  of suppliers  in  relation  to  risk  mapping,  i.e.  assessments through an Internet platform and on-site audit campaigns (2.5.5.2);\n- \u25cf Actions to mitigate risks and prevent serious infringements (2.5.5.3):\n- -A responsible  purchasing  policy  establishing  the principles  of  responsible  contractual  relations  with suppliers  and  covering  the  risks  identified  in  the mapping;\n- -A  decisive  criterion  when  choosing  suppliers  and subcontractors;\n- -Monitoring of corrective action plans following audits at supplier sites;\n- -An ESG-focused purchasing team.\n- \u25cf A system for monitoring the measures implemented and evaluating their effectiveness (2.5.5.4);\n- \u25cf A whistleblowing tool (2.5.6).\n\nI\n\n02",

Starting with all cathode suppliers, and extending to certain  artisanal  mines  in  the  Democratic  Republic  of Congo, audits were carried out at every level of the supply chain. No critical cases of non-compliance were identified, and corrective action plans are being implemented. In 2020, the  monitoring  of  action  plans  by  cathode  suppliers  and certain refiners continued.\n\nFollowing the EU Battery Regulation, which came into force in 2023, Renault Group has strengthened its approach to risk\n\nmanagement.  In  particular,  at  the  end  of  2023,  Renault Group  launched  a  study  with  a  consulting  firm  in  order  to draw  up  a  'Critical  material/Country'  cross-risk  map  for 18  ores,  including  cobalt,  lithium,  nickel,  manganese  and natural graphite, which are used in batteries. This mapping will  be  finalised  in  2024.  It  will  be  based  on  an  ESG  risk assessment  methodology  using  public  and  transparent indicators  and  will  make  it  possible  to  better  identify  and prioritise Environment / Health - Safety / Human Rights and Governance risks according to ore and country.\n\nIn  addition  to  these  actions,  Renault  Group  also  initiated direct  partnerships  with  key  raw  material  suppliers  for  its battery supply chain in 2021.\n\nFollowing  the  partnerships  set  up  with  VULCAN  Energy  in 2021 to source lithium 30 ,  with TERRAFAME 31 for a sustainable supply  of  nickel  and  with  MANAGEM  Group  in  2022  for  a sustainable supply of cobalt 32 ,  Renault  Group  set  up  a  new strategic  partnership  in  2023  with  the  French  group ARVERNE,  a  specialist  in  low-carbon  lithium  production. These  partnerships  reinforce  the  development  of  a  more sustainable, transparent battery value chain.\n\nLastly, in 2022, in an effort to anticipate risks, Renault Group joined a group of NGOs, scientists and companies calling for a global  moratorium  on  deep-sea  mining until it is scientifically  proven  that  it  can  be  done  in  a  sustainable way.  The  seabed,  rich  in  minerals  necessary  for  the manufacture of batteries, is essential in climate regulation and for the generation of means of subsistence for women and men.\n\n## 2.4.2.2 Contribution of purchasing to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in the supply chain\n\nSee section 2.2.2.1, 'Climate and energy efficiency'.\n\n## 2.4.2.3 A local integration strategy  EFPD14a\n\nLocal  integration  is  a  major  element  of  Renault  Group's purchasing  policy  because  it  can  improve  the  Group's competitiveness, reduce its exposure to monetary fluctuations  and  contribute  to  the  development  of  the regions where it is located.\n\nA local approach has numerous advantages leading to the reduction of costs.  Thus,  the  local  purchasing  of  parts  can reduce  transport  and  customs  costs.  This  proximity  also enables the Company to be more responsive, to adapt more quickly  to  changes  in  demand  from  its  customers  and  to participate  in  local  development  and  notably  the  local employment pool.\n\nTo  promote  local  integration,  Renault  Group  has  created dedicated  teams  in  LATAM,  Morocco  and  India.  These teams,  from  purchasing,  engineering,  sales  costs  and logistics,  launch  local  calls  for  tenders  to  purchase  parts that until then were imported.\n\nIn  addition,  Renault  Group  seeks  to  localise  its  suppliers  as much as possible in the development phases of new projects.\n\nThe  localisation  rate  is  intrinsically  connected  with  local regulations, currency exchange rates, the Group's industrial activity (launching of new projects) and may vary on a yearto-year basis.\n\n- 31 Press release: https://media.renaultgroup.com/renault-group-to-partner-with-terrafame-for-sustainable-nickel-supply/?lang=eng",

In  all  countries  where  it  is  established,  Renault  Group ensures  compliance  with  tax  rules  applicable  to  its activity,  in  accordance  with  international  conventions and local laws.\n- 2. In its relations with tax authorities, Renault Group aims at strictly complying with tax procedures and endeavours to maintain  good  relations  in  order  to  maintain  its reputation. Renault Group endeavours to create a lasting, transparent  and  professional  relationship  of  trust  with tax authorities of different countries and opts for special partnership programmes  with  the tax authorities whenever possible.\n- 3. Renault  Group  does  not  encourage  or  promote  tax evasion for itself or for its subsidiaries.\n- 4. Renault  Group  applies  OECD  principles  for  transfer pricing,  and  intra-Group  transactions  comply  with  the arm's-length  principle.  When  local  constraints  require deviation from OECD methodologies, such local constraints are documented.\n- 5. Renault Group is fully  committed to the implementation of regulations aimed at ensuring tax transparency at the local, EU or international level.\n\nSustainable development\n\n- 6. Given  the  complexity  of  tax  rules,  Renault  Group  may have differences of interpretation with local tax authorities.  It  then  reserves  the  right  to  contest  any adjustments that are deemed unfounded.\n\n## 2.4.3.2 Implementation of tax policy\n\nRenault Group's Tax Division is responsible for the Group's tax policy worldwide, including the management of all taxrelated risks.\n\nRenault Group's Tax Division, as a support function attached to  the  Group  Finance  Division,  is  independent  of  the operational functions. It is supported by a local tax network in its mission.\n\nTax  risk  management  is  an  integral  part  of  the  Group's overall risk management process.\n\nThe  Group  Tax  Division  ensures  the  dissemination  of  tax compliance standards within the Group (Automotive, Sales Financing and Mobility Services) through internal communication channels.\n\nThe  Group  Tax  Division  takes  a  responsible  approach  to managing and controlling tax matters, based on the relevant documentation and rigorous internal control of tax processes.\n\n## 2.4.4 Cybersecurity and data protection\n\n## 2.4.4.1 Cybersecurity\n\nTo manage risks and protect its data, Renault Group has set up  an  organisation/governance  and  operational  measures\n\nin  matters  of  cybersecurity.  Details  of  these  measures  can be found in chapter 1.5.1.4. Cybersecurity.\n\n## 2.4.4.2 Data protection\n\nRespect  for  personal  data  protection  is  a  pillar  of  trust between  Renault  Group  and  its  shareholders,  customers, suppliers and employees. Trust is indeed an essential value for  Renault  Group,  and  the  protection  of  personal  data  is therefore at the heart of our actions.\n\nIn view of this commitment, in 2011, Renault Group appointed a Data  Protection  Officer  (DPO)  to  the  Commission Nationale  de  l'Informatique  et  des  Libert\u00e9s  (CNIL)  and implemented legal, technical and organisational measures to  comply  with  law  no.  78-17  of  6  January  1978  on  data protection.  In  May  2018,  Renault  Group  appointed  a  Data Protection  Officer  (DPO)  to  comply  with  the  General  Data Protection  Regulation  (GDPR).  This  Officer  defines  and steers  the  actions  of  Renault  S.A.S.  and  coordinates  the actions of the Data Protection Officers (DPO) of the Group's European  and  foreign  subsidiaries  to  ensure  that  all  the Group's activities comply with these standards.\n\nFor Renault S.A.S., the Data Protection Officer relies (i) on a network  of  local  DPOs,  GDPR  correspondents  ('Privacy Ambassadors'), in each department who are responsible for managing  the  compliance  of  projects  including  personal data processing within their scope, assisted by a network of Privacy Representatives within their Department, and (ii) on a  legal  team  dedicated  to  personal  data  protection.  In addition, multidisciplinary working groups comprising all of Renault  Group's  Functional  Departments  and/or  the  IT Department and, more specifically, the cybersecurity teams have  been  set  up  to  develop  Personal  Data  Protection governance  and  also,  on  an  ad  hoc  basis  and  upstream, focus on the implementation of new projects involving the processing of personal data.\n\nThe  Group's  subsidiaries  deploy  all  or  part  of  this organisation, taking into account their local characteristics.\n\nI\n\n02",

This training is to be carried out twice a year. To optimise the time and the comfort of the learners as  well  as  the  impact  of  these  training  courses,  the e-learning is composed of:\n\n- \u25cf three fundamental modules lasting 25 minutes, intended for all employees,\n- \u25cf eight targeted 10-minute modules for different businesses or  regions  (HR,  IT,  Marketing,  Contractual  relations,  local specificities  China  &  Korea,  International  data  transfers, autonomous and connected vehicle, R&AE).\n\nThe  offer  is  deployed  in  11  languages  and  the  different modules  are  assigned  to  employees  according  to  their profession and scope. For example, three targeted modules (Contractual  Relations,  International  Data  Transfers  and Local  Specificities)  have  been  created  in  addition  to  the fundamental modules. A number of documents, frequently asked questions and guides for implementing personal data protection  from  the  design  stage  are  available  to  the business teams to ensure that all projects involving personal data  processing  are  designed  in  compliance  with  the applicable regulations. Lastly, model appendices relating to personal data protection and security are made available to\n\n## 2.4.5 Lobbying activities\n\nThe Group's lobbying activities support its strategy, which is part  of  the  green  transition  and  aims  to  strengthen  its industrial  and  technological  activities  at  all  its  locations, particularly in France. The ambitions of this strategy take into account  the  requirements  set  by  the  UN  Sustainable Development  Goals  and  the  Paris  Climate  Agreement, particularly in terms of combating greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nIn its Climate  Report 33 (based  in particular on the expectations of the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD)), published for the first time in 2021  and  updated  in  the  2022  Universal  Registration Document  and  in  its  2022-2023  Integrated  Report 34 , the Group  reaffirms  its  strong  commitment  to  sustainable mobility that respects its ecosystems.\n\nall  Group  lawyers  and  the  various  business  lines  to  enable Renault Group to comply with regulations in its relations with third parties or even with other Group companies.\n\nIn  order  to  monitor  the  Group's  compliance  with  personal data  regulations,  performance  indicators  are  established each quarter  and  as  required,  on  demand,  to  continuously monitor compliance and its development.\n\nIn  view of its digital transformation, the development of its activities  relating  to  connectivity  and  'data'  (mobility services,  connected  vehicles  and  autonomous  vehicles)  in order to comply with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), Renault Group launched a programme to ensure the implementation of an organisation, governance, processes and  tools  intended  to  protect  the  personal  data  of  its employees and its customers/users.\n\nRenault Group is also involved in working groups organised in  particular  by  the  Comit\u00e9  des  Constructeurs  Fran\u00e7ais d'Automobiles  (CCFA)  and  by  the  European  Automobile Manufacturers'  Association  on  the  specific topic of connected services.\n\nRenault Group therefore takes all necessary precautions to ensure  that  personal  data  is  processed  securely  and  in compliance with regulations.\n\nThe  Group's  lobbying  strategy  includes  a  continuous interaction with stakeholders (civil society, NGOs and public authorities).  To  this  end,  the  Group's  proposals  take  into account impact studies of draft regulations or legislation on a variety of subjects: social, taxes, road user safety and the environment (including the fight against climate change).\n\nIn  particular,  the  Group's  positions  are  conveyed  to  public decision-makers, directly or through associations or unions, to  answer  their  questions  or  propose  adjustments,  taking into account the interests of all the Group's stakeholders.\n\nThe Group is not politically active and does not fund political parties as part of its public representation. The Group is not involved  in  sponsoring  any  local,  regional  or  national political campaigns.\n\nThe Group's ambition is to be net zero carbon in Europe by 2040 and worldwide by 2050.\n\n33 https://www.renaultgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/climate-report-renault-group.pdf 34 https://www.renaultgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/202303\\_rg\\_rapport-integre\\_36\\_en.pdf",

By national regulations\n\nIn  the  case  of  France,  in  accordance  with  the  applicable regulations,  the  Group  sends  a  summary  of  its  lobbying activities, as well as the resources devoted to these activities, to  the  High  Authority  for  the  Transparency  of  Public  Life (HATVP)  each  year 37 . In 2023, without  prejudging  the declaration that will be made, the main positions defended by the Group through its lobbying activities in France, within the meaning of the HATVP guidelines, included:\n\n- \u25cf Support  for  the  development  of  car-sharing  and  new forms of mobility;\n- \u25cf Promotion  of  incentives  and  binding  targets  for  the integration of clean vehicles into the fleets of level entities;\n- \u25cf Promotion  of  a  balanced  ecological  tax  system  that supports the sale of electrified vehicles;\n- \u25cf Support  for  measures  for  the  decarbonisation  of  sites, their  conversion  to  the  new  value  chains  resulting  from the  transformation  of  the  automotive  segment,  and  the resulting  transformation  of  skills  (within  the  company itself or within the sector);\n- \u25cf Issues  related  to  the  management  and  access  to  data, communication and connection of vehicles;\n- \u25cf Support  for  the  deployment  of  public  and  private charging stations.\n\nIn France, where most of the Group's lobbying is done, eight employees were declared in 2022 as lobbyists according to HATVP criteria.\n\nLobbying spending in France, which is reported annually to the  HATVP  in  accordance  with  the  applicable  rules,  was between  \u20ac400,000  and  \u20ac500,000  for  2022,  which  includes part  of  the  pay  of  the  employees  registered  as  lobbyists according  to  HATVP  criteria,  as  well  as  some  of  the contributions paid to professional associations or organisations,  in  accordance  with  HATVP  guidelines.  Final data for 2023 are not available at the time of the writing of this Document.\n\nThe corresponding amounts are published on the HATVP's website.\n\n## 3. By European regulation (European Commission Transparency Register)\n\nExpenditure  on  lobbying  in  the  EU  institutions,  which  is published annually in the EU Transparency Register 38 , jointly managed  by  the  European  Parliament,  the  Council  of  the European Union and the European Commission in section II 'In-house lobbyists', was between \u20ac300,000 and \u20ac399,000 for 2022, which includes employee pay and operating costs as well as membership  fees paid to professional associations  or  organisations.  Final  data  for  2023  are  not available at the time of the writing of this Document.\n\nWith a view to the transition to low-carbon mobility, the main positions  defended  by  Renault  Group  in  2023  in  Brussels mainly concerned:\n\n- \u25cf The  deployment  of  electric  and  zero-emission  mobility solutions, with strong cooperation between all stakeholders  to  define  a  transition  path,  shape  the electric mobility ecosystem and develop and improve the main tools for decarbonising road transport:\n- -Charging infrastructure;\n- -Ultra-fast charging stations across Europe (incentives);\n- -Greening the network;\n- -Incentives to buy electric vehicles (locally and with the EU Social Climate Fund).\n- \u25cf The  creation  of  a  regulatory  framework  that  would achieve  an  optimal  balance  between  industry  and environmental realities and thus achieve net zero carbon by 2050:\n- -European Union CO2 standards for cars and vans;\n- -European Union Emissions Trading System;\n- -European Union Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism.\n\nI\n\n02",

By 2030, Renault Group aims to have 30% of women in management positions.\n\nIn this context, Renault Group is implementing actions in several areas:\n\n- \u25cf Gender diversity: Renault Group is committed to implementing specific measures regarding the position of women in the company, which results in an evolution of its HR processes in terms of recruitment and career management and in the development of an international network of women;\n- \u25cf Disability: Renault Group facilitates the integration of the individuals with disabilities within the Group by implementing specific integration measures, installing adapted workstations and taking actions for communication and raising awareness among employees. The Group is a signatory to the ILO Disability Charter;\n- \u25cf Origin: Renault Group promotes cultural and social diversity within its teams in all the countries in which it operates;\n- \u25cf Age: Renault Group ensures balance between generations and supports its employees throughout their professional life. It draws on the experience, training and know-how of seniors while providing training and ensuring integration of young people in the workforce. Renault Group has signed a charter on the employability of people over 50 years old, covering 10 key commitments.\n\nThe measures are described in section 2.3.2.2.\n\n## 2.5.2.4 System for monitoring the measures implemented and evaluating their effectiveness\n\nThe  Duty  of  Vigilance  Steering  Committee  monitors measures on a monthly basis. A summary is presented to the Ethics and Compliance Committee once a year (for details, see section 2.5.1 Governance of the Vigilance Plan).\n\nThe effectiveness of initiatives in place is measured notably by the number of incidents reported by signatory parties to global framework agreements resulting in the implementation of the measures provided for in the 2018 memorandum (described in section 2.5.2.3). We can note that in 2022, as in 2021, no incident was  subject  to  measurement  within  the  framework  of  the Renault Group memorandum.\n\nThe figures below also reflect the effectiveness of measures taken by the Group:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

We  have  established  a  strategic  roadmap  which demonstrates how we will achieve this ambitious objective.\n\nTo  address  risk,  the  company  has  established  qualitative references namely the Mandatory Rules and Key Requirements which cover health, safety, ergonomics, burns and asphyxiation, environment in projects and serial life.\n\nWe  are  in  the  planning  stages  of  implementing  ISO  45001 with 25 HSEE managers already trained by AFNOR and 1 site (Bursa in Turkey) already accredited, which we will use as a benchmark reference.\n\nThe  internal  control  department  have  implemented  a dedicated procedure to determine the effectiveness of the health,  safety,  ergonomics, and environment management system.\n\nWe  are  compiling  an  HSEE  vade-mecum  which  outlines Renault Group's organisation, roles, and responsibilities, and describes  the  Renault  Group's  HSEE  management  system and  processes,  it  details  the  group's  commitments  (policy, challenges, and  ambitions), and  summarizes  all  the\n\ninitiatives  aimed  at  dealing  with  them  (procedures,  tools, training, etc.).\n\nThe  HSEE  vade-mecum  will  be  officially  published  in  2024 and  will  be  a  critical  tool  to  foster  safety  culture  and promote  sustainable  performance  within  the  group  to reduce  accidents,  occupational  illnesses,  deliver  carbon neutral  sites  and  reduce  the  environmental  footprint  of Renault  Group  (water  consumption,  emissions  in  the  air, waste water, waste and biodiversity).\n\n## Communication\n\nThe HSEE Division delivers a monthly communication to more than  1000  employees  of  various  functions  and  hierarchical levels. This communication includes performance updates and various  functional  articles,  including  information  on  good practices from regional and site HSEE teams.\n\nA monthly 'club m\u00e9tier' is organised for each HSEE domain to discuss aspects such good practices, key objectives, and new initiatives.\n\n## Project Management\n\nThe  HSEE  project  team  has  developed  5  Mandatory  Rules and  22  key  requirements  (5MRs/22KRs),  which  have  been integrated into the company's quality management system. The  contributing  business  activities  have  been  identified, and training has been carried out to ensure that the rules are applied in projects.",

In addition, Process  Engineering  Division  incorporated  a chapter to include HSEE  requirements  into  projects specifications  to  ensure  that  suppliers'  technical  solutions are compliant from day one, especially for vehicle projects.\n\n## Training\n\nEmployee awareness and skills are among the main drivers of the overall HSEE strategy.\n\nTo raise awareness of health and safety among employees and  to  ensure  the  necessary  skills,  a  three-tiered  training program has been defined:\n\nTier 1 - HSE basics with training such as: Safety Workstation Induction  (SWI)  training,  virtual  reality  hazard  hunt,  new employee induction, general introduction to HSEE Mandatory Rules, safety dojo, and accident management.\n\nTier  2  -  Recognised  qualifications  with  external  training courses conducted by reputable training organisations such as:  NEBOSH and ISO 45001 AFNOR (French standardisation committee) on management systems. More technical based taking  e.g.,  for  machinery  safety  (Certified  Machinery Safety Experts (CMSE\u00ae)).\n\nTier  3  -  Specific  theme-based  training  covering  HSEE specific subjects targeting employees that may be exposed to risks associated with their activity and role such as LOTO (Lock-Out  Tag-Out  -  identification  and  isolation  of  supply energies),  electric  vehicles,  machinery  safety,  chemical safety, operating handling equipment, and ergonomics.\n\nIn addition to training provided at corporate level, sites are also involved in training processes addressing their specific needs  (including  local  authorisations:  electricians,  crane drivers, forklift drivers, etc).\n\nVideo  simulations  deriving  from  specific  risks  identified through selected accidents are produced to raise awareness.  Since  2019,  24  such  simulations  have  been created and shared at various levels of the company.\n\nOnce  suitable  risk  control  measures  have  been  identified, they  are  summarised  and  shared  in  a  transversal  memo, and  the  deployment  of  the  associated  action  plans  is monitored  monthly.  To  date,  34  transversal  memos  have been  or  are  being  deployed  and  progress  is  tracked  on  a regular basis.\n\n## Risk Mitigating Initiatives\n\n## Psychosocial diseases\n\nRenault Group clearly affirms its commitment to well-being and mental health in the Health and Safety at Work Policy signed in 2021.\n\nMandatory Rule #7 and 6 key requirements are dedicated to mental health. They were defined in partnership with the HSEE Division, medical coordinators, and the HR function.\n\nDeployment was initiated in 2022 at industrial and engineering sites. To date, 40 committees have been appointed and have begun  to  implement  the  requirements  for  the  promotion  of psychological health and well-being at work.\n\n## Chemical-induced accidents and illnesses\n\nThe  Industrial  Hygiene  team  works  daily  to  control  worker exposure to hazardous substances and chemical compliance covering  CLP/GHS/REACH  regulations  and  to  reduce  the number  of  the  most  hazardous  chemical  substances  used at Renault Group sites, including products containing carcinogenic,  mutagenic,  and  reprotoxic  substances  and endocrine disruptors. Over the last 10 years (from 2014 to 2023), the  use  of  more  than  1,000  products  has  been  eliminated  or avoided,  including  more  than  300  in  2023,  many  paints containing cumene. Following on from the measures to replace the  most  hazardous  substances,  we  have  now  committed  to reducing this number by 50% by 2030 compared to 2021. End of 2023, 45.5% have been suppressed.\n\nIn view  of  the  results  of  the  self-assessments  on  the 8  Mandatory  Rules  /  60  associated  key  requirements  in Health, the first audits conducted in 2022 and the seriousness of  the  potential  consequences  for  health,  a  priority  action program  was  established  and  rolled  out  systematically throughout  2023  with  a  monthly  follow-up  on  the  progress and verification of implementation by the HSEE Division.\n\nEmphasis was placed on the workstations where the most toxic  substances  are  handled  or  emitted  with  the provision  of  a  training  kit  to  raise  the  awareness  of operators at these workstations both about the risks and about  the  importance  of  all  the  protective  measures implemented.  In  2023,  12  functional  audits  on  these 8 Mandatory Rules were conducted.\n\nTraining  on  the  regulations  for  the  transport  of  dangerous goods was also provided, with almost   138 people trained, of which more than half relate to Li-ion batteries.\n\n## Ergonomics: Musculo-Skeletal Disorders (MSD)\n\nDuring  2023,  the  Ergonomics  Department  has  supported 24  new  vehicle  projects  developed  in  all  Renault  Technical Centres  (France,  Romania,  Brazil,  Turkey)  focusing  on inherent ergonomics design. In parallel, the new ergonomic management  system,  which  consists  of  three  pillars (Ergonomics memorandum, Ergonomics evaluation method and  Ergonomics  Mandatory  Rules),  is  now  deployed  in  all industrial and engineering sites.\n\n## 1. Ergonomics Memorandum\n\nThe  Ergonomics  memorandum  is  a  reference  guide  that encompasses standard ergonomic principles, adapted to all fields  of  activity.  Six  specific  ergonomics  memoranda  have been  finalised  and  deployed:  body  shop,  assembly  shop, paint shop, stamping, logistics, and sales & aftersales. In 2023, ergonomics memorandum for logistics has been updated.\n\nI\n\n02",

Ergonomics Evaluation Method (M2E)\n\nThe  new  workstation  ergonomics  assessment  is  now deployed in all industrial sites. The aim is to perform in-depth risk assessments,  to  define  action  plans  to  reduce musculoskeletal disorders and subsequent number of days lost.  All  workstations  in  industrials  are  monitored  with  this tool. All supervisors are trained by ergonomics experts in the factory, and 13,285 workstations have been evaluated.\n\n## 3. Ergonomics Mandatory Rules\n\nThe key criteria and experience gathered from all previous works  have  been  consolidated  into  six  Mandatory  Rules. Each industrial site conducts its self-assessment every year. Ergonomics department started formal audits and 3 audits have already been carried out in France.\n\nAll  these  specifications  are  used  upstream  in  projects  to avoid  the  introduction  of  new  ergonomic  strains  whilst simultaneously  applied  in  production  runs  to  enhance working conditions.\n\n## Traffic (risks related to logistics and internal traffic activities)\n\nIn 2023, the HSEE Division, in collaboration with the site and central  logistics  departments,  continued  to  improve  the tools and standards developed previously, including a safe storage  racking  memorandum  (compilation  of  applicable rules  for  the  whole  life-cycle  of  a  pallet  racking),  a  Safety Compliance  Check    on  pallet  racking,  a  risk  assessment method  'Safe  Site,  Safe  Vehicle,  Safe  Driver'  (SSSVSD) based  on  the  traffic  memorandum,  a  Safety  Compliance Check on forklifts.\n\nThe sites conducted out a 'Safe Site, Safe Vehicle, and Safe Driver' (SSSVSD) self-assessment allowing them to evaluate their  level  of  compliance  with  the  rules  and  prioritise  their prevention  actions.  Renault  is  continuing  its  collaboration with the Association of European Vehicle Logistics (ECG) to reduce  the  number  of  accidents  when  delivering  vehicles. Renault plays an active role in working groups, specifically on accident analysis, safe loading/unloading processes, and delivery site safety.\n\n## Machinery (risks related to accidents with machinery)\n\nTools and procedures have been developed to identify and mitigate  machinery  related  risks.  These  include  essential safety requirements for suppliers, technical safety inspection reports, and the safety compliance check for the approval  of  new  facilities.  Tools  such  as  the  'machine interaction' application help to move  towards  safe conditions for interaction with machines.\n\nThe machinery safety inspection check-list tool provides a solution to hazard identification of machinery and installations in serial life. Since launched in 2021, the initiative has resulted in 3,516 addition inspections carried out in 2023.\n\nThe monthly workshop managers' meeting initiated in 2020 continues  and  brings  together  site  health  and  safety managers  and  machine  maintenance  experts.  Various technical machine safety topics are discussed.\n\nMore  than  ten  sites  received  in  2023  coaching  for inspections  and  machinery  safety  by  corporate  machine safety specialists.\n\n## Thermal (risks of burns and asphyxiation)\n\nThe  HSEE  Division  and  the  Prevention  and  Protection Department  have  introduced  a  new  procedure  to  ensure safety  during  hot  work  activities  (fire  permits),  such  as welding or cutting equipment. This 'fire permit' is established to prevent the risk of fire and explosion caused by hot works. Feedback on this new procedure has been positive.\n\nIn  2023,  the  HSEE  Division  conducted  the  first  official  6  MR Burns & Asphyxiations audit. The sites have done their selfassessments  related  to  the  '6  Mandatory  Rules  for preventing  burns  and/or  asphyxiation'  and  57  associated key requirements. These enable them to assess their level of compliance  with  the  rules  and  to  prioritise  the  preventive actions to be implemented.\n\n## Electrical (Risks associated with electrical vehicles)\n\nThe HSEE dimension has been strengthened in new electric and  hybrid  vehicle  projects  from  the  product  and  process design stage.\n\nSafety is integrated upstream in the design of the product by  standard  solutions  like  safe  design  of  high  voltage batteries, with the electrical lock-out/tag-out procedure for safe  assembly  and  maintenance  on  each  vehicle.  All  the persons  involved  in  these  projects  have  been  trained.  A dedicated training program is updated periodically with the support  of  certified  organisations  (e.g.,  APAVE  or  Bureau Veritas).  The  theoretical  part  of  the  training  program  was supplemented by several practical exercises. It incorporates  more  practice  with  a  specific  Dojo  (safety school) focused  on  hazard  characterisation  and  the implementation of safety rules.\n\nThe  new  training  program  has  already  been  implemented on  several  major  sites.  Deployment  has  continued  through our Academies.  In  manufacturing  plants,  more  than 3500  employees  have  been  trained  since  2020,  including 1000 in 2023.\n\nRenault  Group  HSEE  Division  is  represented  in  the  AFNOR working group dedicated to the NFC18550 standard review (NFC  18  550  standard:  Electrical  risk  prevention  -  Work activities on electric and hybrid vehicles).\n\nIn the scope of transportation of EV batteries, guidelines and training  sessions  on  regulatory  requirements  for  suitable packaging  and  battery  tests  before  transportation  were implemented  by  the  internal  Dangerous  Goods  Safety Advisor.\n\n## Management of safety for contractors on site\n\nTo  support  the  contractor  management  procedure  and  to ensure  the  safe  induction  of  contractors  onto  Renault premises, the Group has chosen to digitalise the prevention plan  via  a  platform  dedicated  to  managing  contractors, named CMT (Contractor Management Tool).",

This training is based on the CARSAT training\n\nmodule. At the end of 2023 approximately 800 people will be trained, representing  around  50%  of  the  concerned population in France. 100% of targeted employees should be trained by mid-2024 and an adapted training as well as the platform will then be deployed in all other countries where Renault is located.\n\n## 2.5.3.1.4 System for monitoring the measures implemented and evaluating their effectiveness\n\nThe  Duty  of  Vigilance  Steering  Committee  monitors measures monthly progress in accordance with objectives. A  summary  is  presented  to  the  Ethics  and  Compliance Committee  once  a  year  (see  section  2.5.1  Governance for details).\n\n## HSEE is building its digital experience\n\nThe  HSEE  Division  is  going  digital  with  a  variety  of applications  management.  For  example,  the  reporting  of occupational accidents and illnesses, alerts and analysis of root causes, management of chemical products, evaluation of  movements  and  postures,  management  of  external companies, as well as regulatory monitoring and compliance. Eventually, these tools will cover all aspects of HSEE.  Digitalisation  helps  to  measure  the  effectiveness  of the measures implemented.\n\n## Statistical evaluation to complement field evaluation\n\nHealth and safety data was audited by an independent third party  at  a  reasonable  level  of  assurance  for  the  first  time during the 2022 financial year.\n\nA  total  of  27  10MR/74KR  safety  audits  (including  9  factory audits) were conducted in 2023, bringing the total number of safety  audits  conducted  since  2017  to  380.  In  addition, Health  department  and  Ergonomics  department  have respectively performed 12 audits and 3 audits according to their respective Mandatory Rules.\n\nAfter a significant reduction of the FR1 39 ,  the Group decided to change the main indicator of accidents at work to FR2 40 (lost-time  accidents)  in  2021.  The  objective  is  to  rapidly reduce the FR2, while maintaining a stable FR1, thanks to all the HSE measures initiated.\n\nThe Group also promotes the reporting of low-severity (first aid)  accidents  and  continues  to  improve  the  reporting process, even in countries where reporting is not mandatory. No targets are set to encourage their reporting. They do not appear in the graph below.\n\nThe  combination  of  preventive  and  corrective  actions described above has resulted in a reduction of the FR2 from a high of 3.7 in 2018 to 1.41 in 2023.\n\n39 Note  2.6.2.\n\n40 Note  2.6.2.\n\nAt  the  same  time,  the  percentage  of  compliance  with  the Safety  10  Mandatory  Rules  /  74  Key  Requirements  of industrial  plants  (biggest  contributors  to  accidents  and occupational illnesses) increased from 57.4% in 2018 to 66.1% at end-2023.\n\nThese developments demonstrate the effectiveness of the strategy implemented.\n\nHealth and Safety results (such as FR2) can be a quantifiable variable remuneration criterion, for employees as well as for executive  officers.  This  will  depend  on  local  or  country agreements  (for  employees)  and  on  recommendations made  by  the  Governance  and  Compensation  Committee (for executive officers).\n\n## Workplace accidents: trends 41 EFPD3b\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Changes in the frequency and severity of workplace accidents (\u221a)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n(\u221a) Indicators audited by the independent third party at a reasonable level of assurance for the 2023 financial year.\n\nI\n\n02",

After investigation by the authorities, some of these illnesses are not attributed to Renault, but they are not subtracted from the reported data.\n\nThe process of reporting occupational diseases in Romania, simplified  at  the  end  of  2019  and  therefore  in  place throughout  2020,  explains  the  increase  in  2020.  Romania also impacted the Group's results in 2022, as COVID-related hospital access restrictions in 2021 led employees to delay reporting in 2022.\n\nFurthermore since 2022, the reduction in the Renault Group scope  (predominantly  due  to  Avtovaz)  also  negatively affected the indicator because they had few occupational\n\nillnesses  but  represented  many  hours.  Thus,  after  the  nonrepresentative years 2021 and 2022, the year 2023 shows a halt in the indicator's increase.\n\nAbout  80%  of  occupational  illnesses  are  musculoskeletal disorders,  and  20%  are  related  to  historical  exposures.  To meet the Group's ambition of zero occupational illnesses, a selection of key requirements among the Mandatory Rules in  ergonomics  and  health  have  been  prioritised  and  are subject  to  reinforced  monitoring.  These  essential  key requirements  focus  on  preventive  actions  to  reduce employee  exposure  and  thus  ultimately  the  number  of occupational illnesses. These requirements include detailed and systematic risk assessments of workplaces, implementation  of  risk  control  measures  and  employee training.  An  ambitious  target  for  compliance  with  these requirements has been set for each site.\n\n(\u221a)  Indicators audited by the independent third party at a reasonable level of assurance for the 2023 financial year.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe  HSEE  Division  includes  in  this  category  of  events  any lost-time  accidents  occurring  on  public  highways,  for example,  between  the  workplace  and  home,  between  the workplace  and  a  supplier's  site,  or  between  home  and  a supplier's site.\n\nTraffic accidents occurring within the geographical coverage  of  Renault  sites  are  monitored  as  part  of  the workplace  accident  frequency  rate.  In  countries  where information  on  traffic  accidents  is  passed  on  to  the employer, Renault Group uses such data to draw up action plans, awareness-raising initiatives, training, etc.\n\nThese actions include awareness-raising, specific communications,  and  employee  training  to  reduce  the number and severity of commuting accidents regardless of the means of transport used (car, motorised two-wheelers, bicycle, scooter, pedestrian).\n\n293 traffic accidents were reported in Renault Group in 2023, 143  of  which  resulted  in  lost  time.  Car  accidents  are  in  the majority and account for 37% and two-wheelers (motorised +  non-motorised)  33%.  Of  the  9,994  days  lost  due  to  traffic accidents in 2023, 4,685 were due to accidents that occurred in 2023, and the remaining 5,309 were due to accidents that occurred before 2023.",

The  rates  changed  very  differently  in  2022  compared with 2021, depending on the impact of the health crisis in the different  countries.  Overall,  the  increase  remains  limited, with  a  rate  of  3.43%  in  2023  compared  with  3.39%  in  2022.\n\nThe absenteeism rate is expressed as a percentage and is calculated  on  the  basis  of  the  average  monthly  workforce and  the  yearly  theoretical  number  of  working  days.  The number  of  days  of  absence  is  expressed  in  working  days, excluding  days  of  furloughs,  layoffs,  strikes,  training  and leave (including maternity and paternity leave). An explanation  of  the  calculation  method  is  available  in appendix 2.6.2.\n\n## 2.5.3.2 Security: protecting against malicious acts\n\nSecurity includes all the means implemented by companies to  protect  themselves  from  risks  and  malicious  acts.  Risks and malicious acts are suffered and depend on the political and  economic  stability  of  the  country,  the  local  security\n\nenvironment,  and  the  attractiveness  of  the  company's activity.  Conversely,  safety,  addressed  in  section  2.5.3.1, concerns the risks arising from our activity.\n\n## 2.5.3.2.1 Risk mapping: identification, analysis and prioritisation\n\n## Methodology\n\nThe  key  risks  were  identified,  analysed  and  prioritised  by specialists  from  the  Group's  Prevention  and  Protection Department  (D2P),  in  collaboration  with  the  Sustainable Development and Risk Management Departments. The last update was in 2023. This mapping is based on :\n\n- \u25cf external benchmarks;\n- \u25cf risk assessments conducted by specialists in each risk;\n- \u25cf an  analysis  of  malicious  acts  committed  at  Group  sites over the last 10 years (see 2.5.3.2.2 and 2.5.3.2.4);\n- \u25cf monitoring  of  the  social,  economic,  environmental  and safety situation in the Group sites' host regions.\n\n## Results\n\n## Identification\n\n| Risk description   | Risk description                  |\n|--------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| -                  | Malicious acts on site            |\n| -                  | Malicious acts off site           |\n| -                  | Digital malicious acts or threats |\n\n## Analysis and prioritisation\n\nThe risk prioritisation presented in this matrix is the result of an  in-depth  analysis  and  then  a  summary  of  the  risks assessed at each Group site.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nI\n\n02",

Furthermore, at the oldest sites, which were  built before environmental regulations  and  best  practices  appeared,  legacy  pollution resulting  exclusively  from  past  operations  is  currently being treated.\n- Air  pollution: bodywork  painting  in  particular  releases Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC) that may impact health if not controlled.\n- Greenhouse  gas  emissions: these are principally associated with energy consumption at sites and encompass  direct  emissions  from  internal  facilities  that consume gas and indirect emissions from the production of the electricity used. These air emissions have an impact on climate change.\n- Waste, in  particular  hazardous  waste,  can  have  an impact if  storage  and  transport  are  inadequate  and  if  it  is not recycled and processed in specialised facilities.\n- Use of water resources: in 2023, Renault Group consumed 4.2 m 3 of  water per vehicle produced. The impacts of water abstraction can be very different from one site to another: in some areas enduring water stress, the impact can be very\n\nsignificant  and  possibly  cause  conflicts  between  users. Pressure on water resources will also increase, notably due to climate change.\n\n- Wastewater in natural environments: the  water  used  in production  processes  and  sanitation  facilities  is  treated internally  and  externally  before  it  is  released  into  natural environments.  It  may  impact  the  receiving  environment  in the event of a failure in the water treatment system.\n- Legionella: some  industrial  processes,  in  particular  in cooling  towers,  may,  if  operating  conditions  are  not controlled properly, encourage the proliferation of legionella bacteria,  which  may then be dispersed in the environment through the released water particles and potentially impact the  health  of  the  more  vulnerable  people  living  in  the surrounding area.\n- Noise: this  is  principally  generated  by  logistics  and processes at sites, entailing a potential health impact on the people  living  in  the  surrounding  areas  if  exposure  is excessive.\n- Biodiversity: the Group's activities may impact biodiversity in the areas around them, for the reasons listed above, or impact it directly (new construction that involves sealing soil).",

This  analysis  makes  it possible  to  assess  and  prioritise  the  risks  and  potential impacts by rating the criticality of the 'appearance/impact' pairs.  The  criteria  taken  into  account  are  the  severity, frequency,  sensitivity  of  the  environment  and  the  level  of operational  control.  This  prioritisation  of  the  risks  and potential impacts generated by the site's activities is carried out with a view to implementing corrective measures.\n\nSince 2021, a new in-house tool for mapping major risks has reinforced  this  approach  at  all  of  the  Group's  sites (industrial, logistics, engineering or dealerships): the 'Environment  Mandatory  Rules  (MR)'  and  the  associated key requirements.\n\nThis  is  a  reference  system  containing  all  the  identified critical risks and providing a key to score each site in relation to  these  risks,  in  a  prioritised  and  systematic  manner.  This in-house  reference  system  developed  in  2020  draws  on more  than  20  years  of  feedback  from  experience  from experts at the Corporate Environment Department. It covers the  main  families  of  risks  discussed  above  and  the  52  key risks, providing a precise description of the various levels of criticality  associated  with  each  risk,  serving  as  a  basis  for each site's self-assessment.\n\nThe  resulting  mapping  undergoes  a  shared  approval process and conclusions are shared among Corporate and site management.\n\n## 2.5.4.2 Procedures for regular assessment of the situation of the Group and its subsidiaries based on the risk mapping\n\nThe  process  to  assess  the  situation  of  sites  on  a  regular basis in light of the risk mapping discussed in section 2.5.4.1 relies on self-evaluations and on-site audits. It is depicted in the flowchart below. The assessment of the situation of all the sites (industrial,  logistics,  engineering  or  dealerships)  is updated  on  a  regular  basis.  The  objective  is  to  update assessments every year and conduct internal audits  at  all\n\nsites over a three-year cycle (the cycle started at end-2021). At  the  sites  with  the  most  significant  environmental impacts,  the  in-depth  environmental  analysis  completing this  assessment  is  updated  whenever  a  project  that  may entail environmental impacts or risks is undertaken, and at least every three years.\n\nI\n\n02",

Once the  impacts  and  risks  are  known,  these  sites  roll  out  an action plan aimed at preventing and reducing the identified potential harm to the environment.\n\nThis  approach  was  reinforced  in  2021  for  all  sites  by  the mapping  of  major  risks  developed  through  the  rating  of\n\nenvironmental  fundamentals  or  'Mandatory  Rules',  which makes it possible to classify each site according to its level of deployment of these fundamentals and good practices in terms of environmental protection (A, B, C, D, or E and overall %  per  site).  For  each  of  the  52  identified  risks,  the  system provides a detailed presentation of the actions required to reduce criticality and achieve adequate or optimum status.

Among  the  countries  in  which  the Group has a significant number of supplier sites, four priority countries in  terms  of  risk  have  been  selected:  China,  India, Morocco, Russia and Turkey. Supplier site audit campaigns focus in particular on these countries.\n\nThe  audit  results  of  recent  years  have  made  it  possible  to supplement  the  risk  analysis  with  a  more  quantitative approach  to  each  type  of  risk:  environment,  health  and safety, human rights,  and governance.\n\nAll  of  these  elements  made  it  possible  to  construct  the following mapping:\n\n## Risk mapping\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|         | Env                        | Health &  Safety   | Social &  Human  Rights   | Governance   |\n|---------|----------------------------|--------------------|---------------------------|--------------|\n| China   |                            |                    |                           |              |\n| India   |                            |                    |                           |              |\n| Morocco | Insufficient data for 2023 |                    |                           |              |\n| Turkey  |                            |                    |                           |              |\n| Minor   | Moderate                   |                    | High                      | Critical     |\n\nThis  mapping,  based  on  the  analysis  of  occurrences  of  nonconformities detected during audits, is improved year on year by  capitalising  on  successive  campaigns  and  continuing  to integrate  external  studies  and  benchmarks.  Lastly,  this mapping is used to build future site audit campaigns.\n\n## SPECIFIC RISKS RELATED TO RAW MATERIALS\n\nSince 2021, Renault Group has been forging strategic partnerships with suppliers to secure the supply of certain raw materials in the electric battery supply chain and build a more sustainable and transparent battery value chain.\n\nRenault  Group  signed  agreements  in  2021  with  Vulcan  Energy  for  a  low-carbon,  European  supply  of  lithium  and  with  Terrafame  for  a sustainable supply of nickel.\n\nIn 2022, Renault Group signed an agreement with Managem Group for a sustainable supply of Moroccan cobalt.\n\nIn  2023,  Renault  Group signed a strategic partnership with the Arverne group, a specialist in geothermal energy and low-carbon lithium production for the electric vehicle battery industry.\n\nTo improve the identification and prioritisation of risks, the Group relies on:\n\n- \u25cf An internal methodology combining price, volume and ESG risks.\n- \u25cf Collective  initiatives  measuring  ESG  risks.  For  example,  within  ERMA  see  2.5.5.3.d)  or  alongside  other  companies  in  the  RECORD association, through which Renault Group co-sponsored a study in 2022-2023 entitled 'Environmental, social and societal risks related to transition minerals'.\n- \u25cf Bilateral work with our suppliers.\n- \u25cf At  the  end  of  2023,  Renault  Group  launched  a  'Material/Country  Risk  Mapping'  study  to  improve  the  assessment  and  ranking  of Environment,  Health  &  Safety,  Human  Rights  and  Governance  risks  for  18  critical  materials,  depending  on  the  country.

From 2018 to 2023, the Group commissioned 152 social, safety, health, environmental  and  ethics  audits  of  supplier  sites, performed by outside companies mainly in five countries: China, India, Morocco, Russia 42 and Turkey.\n\n## 2.5.5.3 Actions to mitigate risks and prevent serious harm\n\nIn order to prevent serious infringements, under the duty of vigilance, Renault Group:\n\n- \u25cf applies  its  responsible  purchasing  policy,  a  set  of requirements with respect to its suppliers and subcontractors ( a );\n- \u25cf regards  the  commitment  to  comply  with  its  responsible purchasing policy as a decisive criterion when choosing suppliers and subcontractors ( b );\n- \u25cf monitors  implementation  of  corrective  action  plans prepared following supplier site audits ( c );\n- \u25cf relies  on  a  dedicated  team,  reporting  to  the  Purchasing Department ( d ).\n\nThis action plan includes constant progress updates, which will be reported on at a later date.\n\n## a. A responsible purchasing policy, the cornerstone of the supplier relationship\n\nThe  risks  identified  in  the  mapping  are  addressed  in  a requirement with respect to our suppliers and subcontractors  (see  table  on  next  page).  Renault  Group relies  on  documents  that  set  out  principles  of  responsible contractual relationships with suppliers:\n\n- \u25cf the  'Renault  Group  Corporate  Social  Responsibility Guidelines for Suppliers' (document updated in November  2023).  Distributed  to  all  its  suppliers  and subcontractors,  this document  summarises  Renault Group's ESG expectations of suppliers and subcontractors  in  matters  of  safety  and  quality,  human and  labour  rights,  environment,  compliance  and  nondisclosure  of  information;  The  Group  asks  its  suppliers and subcontractors to commit in writing to comply with these  guidelines.  They  are  also  asked  to  use  them  with their own suppliers;\n\n- \u25cf the Global Framework Agreement on social, societal and environmental  responsibility,  signed  in  2013,  with  the IndustriALL Global Union and the Group Works Council. In this document, Renault Group undertakes to communicate the Framework Agreement to its suppliers and  subcontractors.  It  requests  them  to  commit  to implementing  the  rights  mentioned  in  chapter  1  of  the Framework  Agreement  in  their  own  companies  and encourages them to do likewise with their own suppliers. If necessary,  corrective  action  plans  are  put  in  place  with the support of Renault Group;\n- \u25cf the  'Renault  Green  Procurement  Guidelines'  (document updated  in  November  2023):  distributed  to  all  Renault Group suppliers and describes requirements in matters of environmental  management,  biodiversity,  policies  on chemicals and recycling;\n- \u25cf Renault Group policy on the supply of cobalt and minerals from  conflict-affected  and  high-risk  areas  (2019).  This policy  provides  suppliers  and  their  subcontractors  with details of products that may contain such minerals, and the  Group's  expectations  as  regards  human  rights  and child labour in the supply chain;\n- \u25cf Renault  Group  commitments  regarding  sourcing  of sustainable natural rubber (2022).\n\nThe  Purchasing  function  also  has  a  dedicated  Code  of Practice that reinforces the Ethics Charter. This document is available  on  the  Group's  intranet  site.  It  is  aimed  at  all managers  and  employees  in  the  Purchasing  Department and at anyone who is in contact with suppliers and/or who has  an  influence  on  purchasing  activities  within  Renault Group  and/or  for  Renault  Group.  The  code  applies  to  all Renault  Group  purchasing  processes  and,  in  particular,  to compliance  with  Renault's  strategy,  to  selecting  suppliers, reviewing  performance  and,  more  generally  speaking, to any contact or communication with suppliers.",

This could be addressed in future action plans, monitored by the Duty of Vigilance Steering Committee (see section 2.5.1. Governance of the Vigilance Plan).\n\n## b. A  decisive  criterion  when  choosing  suppliers  and subcontractors\n\nRenault  Group  has  committed,  through  its  2013  global framework  agreement,  to  ensuring  that  respect  for fundamental rights is a decisive criterion in the selection of suppliers and subcontractors. This applies to inclusion in the Group  of  eligible  suppliers  and  subcontractors  but  also  to awarding of new contracts.\n\n## c. Monitoring  of  corrective  action  plans  following  audits at supplier and subcontractor sites\n\nIdentified non-compliance is addressed in corrective action plans, which are put in place with the support of the Group. The  Responsible  Purchasing  Department  monitors  the implementation  of  these  plans  with  the  suppliers  with  the\n\nlowest  scores,  with  mandatory  re-auditing  for  these suppliers. Once identified, any failure not corrected leads to various  measures,  including  Renault  Group  terminating relations with the company concerned.\n\n## d. An ESG-focused purchasing team\n\nTo prevent serious breaches of the duty of vigilance, Renault Group  relies  on  a  dedicated  team,  attached  to  the Purchasing Department, whose objectives are:\n\n- \u25cf ensuring that suppliers meet standards and comply with laws,  regulations  and  soft  laws  relating  to  employment, health, safety, the environment and ethics (e.g. the French law  on  the  duty  of  vigilance,  Sapin  2,  the  EU  Battery Regulation, OECD/UN/ILO Guidelines, etc.);\n- \u25cf improving the identification and reduction of ESG risks in the supply chain;\n\nI\n\n| Health, Safety,  and Security                                              | Coverage by the  responsible  purchasing  policy   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|\n| Physical related  diseases                                                 |                                                    |\n| Chemical related  diseases                                                 |                                                    |\n| Psychosocial  diseases                                                     |                                                    |\n| Accidents with  machinery                                                  |                                                    |\n| Slips, trips  and falls                                                    |                                                    |\n| Traffic                                                                    |                                                    |\n| Falls from height                                                          |                                                    |\n| Thermal                                                                    |                                                    |\n| Lifting equipment                                                          |                                                    |\n| Electrical                                                                 |                                                    |\n| Manipulation  (MSD excluded)                                               |                                                    |\n| Musculo-Skeletal  Disorders (MSD)  including ergonomics  related accidents |                                                    |\n\n| Environment Coverage by the  responsible  purchasing  policy   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Ground pollution                                               |\n| Air pollution                                                  |\n| Greenhouse gas  emissions                                      |\n| Waste production                                               |\n| Use of water resources                                         |\n| Wastewater in natural  environments                            |\n| Legionella                                                     |\n| Noise                                                          |\n| Impacts on biodiversity                                        |\n\n02",

Note that  the  law  of  21  March  2022,  on  the  protection  of whistleblowers 43 , in addition  to  confirming  the  parties mentioned above, added shareholders, job applicants and former employees.\n\nThe whistleblowing system covers the issues raised by the 2017  French  law  on  the  duty  of  vigilance.  It  is  accessible through the Renault Group institutional website.\n\nThis system relies on, in particular, a platform managed by an  external  service  provider  and  can  be  accessed  at  any time,  any  day  of  the  week,  on  a  professional  or  personal computer, tablet or smartphone online at https://renault.whistleb.com. The global whistleblowing system  is  available  in  15  languages.  The  platform  ensures the confidentiality of exchanges and therefore enables the whistleblower's identity to be protected under the conditions  provided  for  by  the  applicable  national  laws. Renault Group prohibits and does not practise any form of retaliation against whistleblowers.\n\nSustainable development\n\nIn 2023, the procedure for handling whistleblower alerts was updated  to  incorporate  the  requirements  of  the  new  EU Whistleblower  Protection  Directive 44 . The  platform  is  also now available on the Renault Group website. As it does every year,  Renault  Group  also  reminded  its  suppliers  and subcontractors  of  the  possibilities  offered  by  the  WhistleB whistleblowing system, accompanying the communication with a detailed user's guide.\n\nIn 2023, 568  new  reports were  received  through  the whistleblowing  tool  worldwide 45 .  All  reports  are  examined. Of the closed cases, after investigation, 29% were confirmed, with the main causes being: acts of psychological harassment, unethical behaviour and fraud.\n\nMost  cases  are  handled  locally  by  the  Ethics  &  Compliance correspondent for the country or subsidiary. Reports relating to  France  and  Corporate  Departments  are  handled  by  the Whistleblowing Department and the Whistleblowing Committee, which is made up of seven members and three experts  and  is  chaired  by  Renault  Group's  SVP,  Ethics  and Compliance.  In  other  countries,  alerts  are  handled  by  the Country  Ethics  and  Compliance  Committee  (CECP),  chaired by  the  Country  Director.  A  detailed  report  containing statistics on whistleblowing worldwide is presented annually to the Group Ethics and Compliance Committee (CECG) and to the Audit  and  Risk  Committee  (CAR),  a  specialist committee of Renault Group's Board of Directors.\n\nThe  reporting  platform  is  complementary  to  the  other whistleblowing  channels:  trade  unions,  the  managerial  line, human resources and the Ethics and Compliance Department.\n\n- 43 French law No. 2022-401 of 21 March 2022, to improve the protection of whistleblowers transposed Directive (EU) 2019/1937 of 23 October 2019.\n- 44 French law No. 2022-401 of 21 March 2022, to improve the protection of whistleblowers transposed Directive (EU) 2019/1937 of 23 October 2019.\n- 45 These reports go beyond the scope of the French law on the duty of vigilance. The deployment of this alert system also enables Renault Group to comply with the French 'Sapin 2' law of 2016 on transparency, the fight against corruption and the modernisation of economic life.\n\nI\n\n02",

For  spare  parts, as we do not have an information system that would allow direct identification of parts fitted to low-emission vehicles, we  have  estimated  this  turnover  in  proportion  to  the 'workshop' turnover generated for low-emission vehicles.\n\n## Investments\n\nTo determine the substantial contribution of eligible vehiclerelated  activities,  we  analysed  the  Capex  and  capitalised R&D  expenditure  based  on  vehicle  model  and  powertrain technology  in  the  same  way  as  for  turnover.  These investments  have  been  reserved  for  new  low-emission vehicle  projects.  Capital  expenditure  common  to  both electric  and  internal-combustion  vehicles  (such  as  for equipment fitted on multiple models) has been prorated for sales  of  low-emission  vehicles  in  the  medium-term  sales plan.  All  industrial  investments  relating  to  the  Rafale  PHEV have  been  included,  as  this  model  meets  the  applicable substantial contribution criteria.\n\nApproximately 50% of the total corresponds to salaries and social security contributions in capitalised R&D expenditure.\n\n## Operational expenditure\n\nThe  allocation  of  operational  expenditure  to  economic activities  followed  the  same  logic  as  described  for  capital expenditure. Wherever possible, non-capitalised R&D costs have been directly allocated to the vehicles. They have been included  if  the  vehicles  in  question  make  a  substantial contribution  to  the  climate  change  mitigation  objective. We  have  not  included  non-capitalised  research  and development costs directly attributable to vehicles that do not  meet  the  selection  criteria.  Non-capitalised  research and development costs that were not clearly attributable to a  particular  vehicle  project -notably  upstream  research projects -and other operating costs have been included on a  proportional  basis  using  allocation  formulas  similar  to those used for capital expenditure.\n\n## Due diligence carried out to verify the DNSH criteria of activities 3.3 and 6.5\n\nThe necessary checks were carried out at all the sites where lowemission passenger cars and light commercial vehicles offered by the Group's various brands are designed or produced.\n\n## Climate change adaptation\n\nUnder the TCFD (see 2.2.2.1.4.4), we conducted a climate risk and  vulnerability  assessment  to  identify  sites  likely  to  be affected by physical climate risks. The physical climate risks that we have identified have been assessed on the basis of the  lifetime  of  the  asset  concerned  and  are  essentially  of three  types  (extreme  heat,  water  stress  and  flooding) covered by appropriate action plans (see 4.2.1 and 4.2.2).\n\n## Sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources\n\nIn addition to complying with applicable regulations and the ban on using any non-renewable water source, the factories are committed to reducing the quantities of water needed to  produce  a  vehicle  (see  2.2.2.4.2)  and  to  reducing  toxic metal emissions that can impact water resources (target of 35%  reduction  in  nickel  and  zinc  compound  emissions between 2013 and 2023).\n\n## Transition to a circular economy\n\nThe  Group's  ecodesign  standards  applied  to  vehicles  and batteries  that  allow  for  the  frugal  use  of  scarce  materials, the  integration  of  recycled  contents,  the  preparation  of vehicles for teardown and recycling at the end of their life (see 2.2.2.2).\n\nSince  2007,  95%  of  the  mass  of  the  Group's  vehicles  sold worldwide is recyclable or recoverable (see 2.2.2.2.3.1). All the low-emission  vehicles  that  the  Group  finances,  leases  or operates were put on the road after this date.\n\nAt the end of the life of the electric vehicles marketed by the Group, their batteries are collected and directed towards a second life or recycled following a diagnosis of their state of health (cf. 2.2.2.2.3.4).\n\nWith regard to waste management, Renault Group and the Group's  European  plants  producing  low-emission  vehicles prioritise recycling by trying to minimise any landfill.\n\n## Pollution prevention and control\n\nThe Group is proactive in banning Substances of Very High Concern (SVHC) in new vehicle projects when an alternative exists. Renault voluntarily committed to not using SVHC on average  seven  years  ahead  of  their  regulatory  ban  by incorporating standard RNES-B-0027 into contracts with its suppliers; internally, three teams are leading the reduction in the use of substances beyond the regulatory requirements: the Materials Engineering Division for substances present in the  product,  the  Industrial  Hygiene  and  Chemical  Risks Division for substances present in manufacturing processes,  and  the  Regulatory  Compliance  Division  for after-sales (see 2.2.2.3.2).  As a result, all vehicles designed by the  Group  meet  the  requirement  as  reformulated  by  the Commission in June 2023.\n\nI\n\n02",

Until  then,  our  approach  is  in  line  with  the memorandum  of  interpretation  favoured  by  the  French authorities  of  certain  criteria  in  Appendix  C  of  the  Climate Delegated  Act  of  the  European  Taxonomy,  issued  by  the French Treasury in January 2024.\n\nBy  definition,  low-emission  vehicles  meet  the  emission thresholds for clean light-duty vehicles set out in Table 2 of the Annex to Directive 2009/33/EC.\n\n## Specific criteria for activity 6.5\n\nThe low-emission vehicles that the Group finances, leases or operates are all equipped with tyres in external road noise and  resistance  classes  that  comply  with  the  European requirements  set  out  in  EC  Regulation  661/2009.  As  the requirements  of  the  Taxonomy  go  beyond  regulatory compliance  on  this  criterion,  an  additional  analysis  was conducted  and  demonstrated  that  most  tyre  references originally fitted to low-emission vehicles meet this criterion. However,  despite  our  best  efforts,  it  was  not  possible  to verify  this  for  all  the  financed  vehicles,  as  information  on their  actual  tyre  fitment  is  not  available.  To  date,  this criterion  is  considered  inoperable.  This  position  will  be reassessed in the future depending on the availability of the necessary data.\n\nWith  a  certified  noise  level  well  below  68  dBA,  Renault electric  vehicles  have  met,  since  2021,  the  external  noise limits  applicable  starting  in  2024,  thus  contributing  to  the reduction  of  ambient  noise  and  the  quality  of  life  in  urban areas. All low-emmission vehicles placed on the market by Renault  in  Europe  in  2021  therefore  comply  with  European regulation 540/2014/EC applicable to vehicles certified since July 2016, which require a maximum of 72 dBA (see 2.2.2.3.3).\n\n## Protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems\n\nIn  addition to the environmental impact studies conducted in  accordance  with  national  and  European  regulations, Renault Group is proactive in its defence of biodiversity and ecosystems (see 2.2.2.4.1).\n\n## Verification of compliance with the minimum safeguards\n\nAs  part  of  the  coordination  of  its  Vigilance  Plan,  Renault Group  continuously  ensures  the  proper  performance  of reasonable  due  diligence  and  remediation  procedures necessary to confirm alignment with the following texts:\n\n- \u25cf UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights;\n- \u25cf Core Conventions of the International Labour Organisation (ILO);\n- \u25cf OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises;\n- \u25cf Fundamental Rights at Work and the International Bill of Human Rights.\n\nThese points  are  monitored  monthly  by  the  Vigilance  Plan Steering Committee (see 2.5.1).\n\nThe Compliance Department, working closely with the Legal Department  and  under  the  supervision  of  the  Ethics  and Compliance Committee (CEC), uses a structured approach aimed  at  analysing  and  ensuring  the  robustness  of  its regulatory  compliance  on  a  long-term,  proactive  basis across  a  range  of  major  regulated  areas  including,  in particular, 'competition' and 'corruption' (see 4.2.4)\n\nIn  all  countries where it is established, Renault Group's Tax Department ensures compliance with tax rules applicable to its  activity,  in  accordance  with  international  conventions and local laws through an appropriate management system (see 2.4.3 and 4.2.5).\n\nTo  the  best  of  our  knowledge,  Renault  Group  was  not convicted  in  2023  of  corruption,  tax  evasion,  failure  to respect  human  rights  or  anti-competitive  practices  by  a competition authority (see 4.3).\n\n## Handling of translation discrepancies\n\nThe Taxonomy was created by the European Commission to provide  investors  with  a  'common  language  and  a  clear definition  of  what  is  'sustainable''.  Having  noted  certain discrepancies between the English version and its translation into  French,  Renault  Group  has  chosen  to  refer  only  to  the original English version of the Taxonomy regulation, which is the  most  widely  used  in  our  industry,  in  order  to  favour  the comparability of performance indicators.",

Life Cycle Assessment\n\nThe  Renault  Group  life  cycle  analyses  are  carried  out  in accordance  with  ISO  14040  and  ISO  14044  standards. Renault uses the software and databases of the specialised software LCA for Experts (formerly GaBi).\n\nThe  life  cycle  inventory  describes  all  the  elements  that  are taken into account in the life cycle assessment of a vehicle. These data are related to life cycle stages, from the vehicle's manufacturing to its recycling, and including its usage phase:\n\n- \u25cf raw  materials  and  manufacturing:  thanks  to  Renault's internal databases, each vehicle is described in terms of the  raw  materials  it  contains.  This  information,  coupled with  the  information  in  the  LCA  for  Experts  database, allows all phases of the extraction and processing of raw materials to be incorporated in the inventory. The data on the manufacturing of vehicles integrated in the life cycle inventory comes from the annual environmental reporting  for  the  industrial  sites,  which  is  subjected  to verification by an Independent Third Party;\n- \u25cf usage  and  maintenance  phase:  the  usage  phase  is calculated over 15 years and 200,000 km. The emissions and electrical  consumption certified over the regulatory cycle  are  considered,  plus  20%  to  reflect  the  difference between  certification  and  actual  driving  conditions. Moreover,  the  impacts  associated  with  the  energy consumption  of  vehicles  (diesel,  gasoline  or  electricity) are  calculated  from  'well  to  wheel',  i.e.  the  emissions associated  with  the  production  and  transport  of  the energy used are taken into account. In the usage phase, the maintenance activities performed throughout the life of the vehicle (tyre changes, oil changes, brake fluid, etc.) are taken into account;\n- \u25cf end-of-life: emissions related to dismantling and recycling processes are accounted for.\n\nAll  potential  impacts  are  calculated  using  the  LCA  for Experts software.\n\n## B. Carbon footprint\n\nThe  purpose  of  determining  Renault  Group's  carbon footprint is to measure  and  pilot  the  reduction  of greenhouse gas emissions in Renault Group. The following methodologies have accordingly been chosen:\n\n- \u25cf the  carbon  footprint  is  compared  with  the  number  of vehicles sold;\n- \u25cf if  there  is  an  update  to  the  model  in  the  LCA  for  Experts tool (formerly GaBi) used to calculate the greenhouse gas emissions  associated  with  the  materials  and  parts purchased (see above), the reference value is recalculated with the new database in order to measure the changes to the indicator on a comparable basis;\n- \u25cf the carbon footprint is calculated for a constant scope of emissions.  When  the  scope  is  amended,  the  benchmark value  is  recalculated.  In  2017,  the  calculation  scope  was extended to include: RRG, vehicles bought from and sold to partners, filling of air-conditioning  systems  (for premises  and  vehicles),  vehicle  and  engine  testing  and indirect  emissions  linked  to  purchase  thermal  energy.  In 2018,  two  foundries  were  integrated  into  the  scope without  recalculating  the  benchmark  value,  this  being  a capacity  extension  rather  than  an  integration  of  a  preexisting entity. In 2020, vehicle air-conditioning maintenance was taken into account, with a recalculation  of  the  benchmark  value.  The  conversion factors between certification cycles were also updated.\n\nThe  carbon  footprint  for  Renault  does  not  include  a prospective  dimension.  The  value  used  for  the  carbon intensity of fuel and electricity used by customers is that of the  vehicle  release  year  and  does  not  vary  during  the  life cycle of the vehicle (15 years, 200,000 km).\n\nThe  table  below  indicates  the  scope  of  emissions  covered by  the  Renault  carbon  footprint  indicator  as  well  as  the origin of the data used and the level of external verification applied.  To  facilitate  understanding,  the  categories  of  the Renault  carbon  footprint  are  matched  to  those  of  the Greenhouse Gas Protocol.\n\nI\n\n02",

The  rates applied  to  steel  and  aluminium  are  presented  by  way  of example in the 'Key figures' table in chapter 2.2.2.2.1\n\nFor  the  denominator:  average  total  weight  of  vehicles produced by the Group in Europe, Turkey and Morocco.\n\n## D. Definition of a site biodiversity assessment\n\nAssessment:  evaluation  of  ecological  issues  based  on  onsite  identification  of  observable  elements  of  the  natural environment conducted by an ecologist during a favourable period,  supplemented  by  a  bibliography  study.  Renault Group entrusts them to a specialised design office.\n\n## 2.6.1.3 Methodological comments on the table 'Site environmental indicators in 2023'\n\nReporting for the environmental indicators was conducted in accordance with the stipulations of the 2023 Environmental  Protocol  for  Renault  Group  sites.  The following  is  an  explanation  of  the  main  methodological choices of the Protocol. This Protocol is available on request from  the  Environment  Department  of  the  Group's  Health, Safety, Environment and Ergonomics Division (DHSEE).\n\n## Scope\n\nThe  'scope'  of  the  reported  data  covers  the  industrial subsidiaries (body assembly, final assembly, powertrain and foundry) and the support sites (product and process design, logistics) in the Renault Group financial scope of consolidation.\n\nI\n\n02",

All impacts arising from employee catering facilities, CSR activities and  social  partner  activities  are  included  in  the  data  for  the Renault sites.\n\nData from sites entering the scope during a particular year are  consolidated  with  data  from  other  sites  from  the following  year.  As  such,  information  from  the  Enstone (Alpine  Racing),  Heudebouville  (QStomize),  Les  Ulis  (Alpine Cars) and Viry-Ch\u00e2tillon (Alpine Racing) sites is consolidated for this financial year.\n\nData from GAIA are taken into account at sites where GAIA operates, except the Flins site (France), where GAIA waste is covered  by  a  specific  contract.  The  waste  generated  by GAIA  at  the  Flins  site  represents  less  than  1%  of  the  total waste generated by the Group.\n\nThe drinking water production and Davidesti waste storage activity  at  the  Pitesti  site  (Dacia)  are  excluded  from  the reporting scope. Regarding drinking water activity, consumption is not related to site activity and represents 2% of the Group's total for external water supply and less than 1% for all other indicators. Regarding landfill, the quantities represent less than 1% of the Group's total.\n\n## Data control and consolidation procedures\n\nSpecialised  experts  from  the  Group  DHSEE  check  the consistency  of  data  at  each  site.  These  checks  include  a comparison with data from previous years and an analysis of the impact of events occurring on site during the year.\n\nThe environmental  data  presented  in  the  Universal Registration  Document  have  also  been  subjected  to external verification by the independent third party, Mazars. Their conclusions are set out in the report in section 2.7.\n\n## Vehicle production\n\nThe vehicles counted are those that have gone through the mechanical  line end manufacturing  stage,  which  is standard  for  all  bodywork/assembly  plants.  From  this counting  point,  the  vehicles  leave  the  assembly  line.  They can be driven and are considered to be manufactured, even if they have to be reworked and/or tested afterwards.\n\n## Water supply\n\nExternal water supply is expressed in thousands of m 3 .\n\nIt  includes  water  obtained  by  pumping  (underground  and surface  water)  and/or  external  networks  (drinking  water, industrial water).\n\n## Liquid waste\n\nData  on  pollutant  flows  are  based  on  measurements  of effluents after they have been treated in the Group's plants and before they are discharged to the outside. Discharges from some plants may subsequently be treated in municipal treatment plants (see plant code in 2.6.1.4).\n\nUnder  the  Reporting  Protocol,  the  frequency  of  discharge analysis must comply at least with the regulations.\n\nThe quantity of COD (Chemical Oxygen Demand) represents the  flow  of  organic  pollutants  discharged.  This  quantity  is expressed in metric tons per year.\n\nThe Zn+Ni quantity represents the sum of the zinc and nickel flows discharged. This quantity is expressed in metric tons per year.\n\nThe data presented only take into account the discharges relating to metals and Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD), for which  concentration  and  flow  must  be  measured  by  law, and  the  discharges  from  the  plants  in  Bursa  (Turkey), Curitiba  (Brazil),  Santa  Isabel  de  C\u00f3rdoba  (Argentina)  and Casablanca  (Morocco),  for  which  voluntary  controls  are taken into account in light of the significant contribution of these discharges to the Group's impacts.\n\nThe  Santa  Isabel  de  C\u00f3rdoba,  Curitiba,  Casablanca (SOMACA)  and  Batilly  (Sovab)  sites  are  subject  to  specific regulatory  requirements  and  receive  an  exemption  on  the calculation methodology of the specific flows.\n\nFor sites that are not subject to a regulatory requirement to measure pollutant flows or to consolidate voluntary controls at  the  Group  level,  the  reported  value  is  noted  as  'NC'. Domestic water discharges, for which there is no regulatory measurement and/or reporting obligation, are not included in the water discharges. This concerns 37% of manufacturing  sites  and  75%  of  engineering,  logistics  and support sites.\n\n## Atmospheric emissions\n\nGreenhouse  gas  (GHG)  discharges  include  the  direct  and indirect GHG emissions and are expressed in metric tons of CO2 equivalent (CO2e).\n\nDirect  greenhouse  gas  (GHG)  emissions  are  derived  from  an inventory  of  GHG  sources  conducted  in  2004  and  updated  in part  in  2021.  Following  this  inventory,  Renault  modified  its guidelines to better reflect the total emissions of Renault Group and to comply with the recommendations of the Greenhouse Gas  Protocol  (GHG  Protocol)  and  the  French  protocol developed by Entreprises pour l'Environnement (EPE).",

Only  HFC  134a  fill-up  is taken  into  account.  It  is  not  considered  pertinent  to declare  HFO1234yf  use  under  French  legislation  (Article R.  543-75  of  the  French  Environment  Code  excludes  this gas  from  coolant  fluids)  and  in  view  of  its  negligible impact on GHG emissions;\n- \u25cf fuel  consumption  during  testing  of  engines,  gearboxes endurance vehicles and tests on test benches;\n- \u25cf fuel consumption relating to Renault's company vehicles (taxi pools, shuttles, service vehicles, handling equipment, etc.);\n- \u25cf coolant  leaks  from  fixed  air-conditioning  systems  and processes with a nominal load in excess of 5 teqCO2;\n- \u25cf the  oxidation  of  carbon  entering  the  melting  furnaces that is not found in the outgoing cast iron and is therefore released during melting;\n- \u25cf the  oxidation  of  VOCs  incinerated  by  incinerators  and resulting in CO2 emissions.\n\nThese emissions make up more than 95% of the direct GHG emissions produced by Renault Group.\n\nEmissions  linked  to  vehicle  testing  at  the  end  of  the assembly  (testing  on  chassis  dynamometers)  have  been excluded from the reporting scope because the corresponding  emissions  were  deemed  insignificant  (less than 1% of total direct GHG emissions).\n\nIt is not yet possible to correctly assess certain emissions, so the following are not included in the reporting scope:\n\n- \u25cf emissions  associated  with  transport  on  sites  not  listed above  among  the  emissions  counted  (particularly  the delivery by a road haulier external to Renault Group);\n- \u25cf fugitive  emissions  occurring  when  tanks  of  coolant  (for vehicle air-conditioning systems) are filled and emptied;\n- \u25cf emissions linked to SF6-type circuit breaker facilities.\n\nGreenhouse  gas  (GHG)  indirect  discharges  are  related  to purchased  electricity,  steam  and  hot  water.  The  emission factors used for the 2023 reporting are:\n\n- \u25cf for  electricity,  those  published  directly  by  suppliers  or, if  these  are  not  available,  those  published  by  the  IEA (International  Energy  Agency)  in  its  publication Emission Factors 2023 ;\n- \u25cf for steam and hot water, data calculated on the basis of information provided by suppliers.\n\nEmissions  factors  used  in  the  calculations  of  SO2,  NOx  and GHG  emissions  are  taken  from  the  CITEPA's  OMINEA National Inventory Report (updated in May 2023) or  from the Regulation  (EU)  2018/2066  and  are  consistent  with  the recommendations  of  the  Intergovernmental  Panel  on Climate Change (IPCC).\n\n| General       | Sustainable   | Corporate   | Risk and   | Financial   | presentation of   | Additional   |\n|---------------|---------------|-------------|------------|-------------|-------------------|--------------|\n| Renault Group | development   | governance  | control    | statements  |                   | information  |\n\n## Sustainable development\n\nThe emission factor from fixed combustion installations of low-NOx  natural  gas  burners  was  calculated  in  2011,  based on an internal study of 88% of sites in the scope having lowNOx burners. The factor thus obtained (0.0266kg/MWh LHV) is the average of the factors obtained at each site weighted by the power of the installations.\n\nThe  atmospheric  emissions  of  SO2  and  NOx  counted represent  the  emissions  from  the  combustion  of  fossil energies  in  fixed  combustion  installations  at  all  sites, excluding on-site transport.\n\nSO2  and  NOx  emissions  generated  by  engine  tests  are  not taken into account, since the SO2 emissions are insignificant and  NOx  emissions  are  difficult  to  calculate  (unreliable assessment method).\n\nThe atmospheric emissions of Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC) included in the data are the emissions produced when bodywork is painted (bodywork and assembly plants). The application  of  paint  on  bumpers  and  on  parts  and accessories is not taken into account.\n\nThe indicator shown corresponds to the metric tons of VOC emissions and the ratio of VOC emissions per m 2 of painted vehicle  surface.  The  consolidated  ratio  for  the  Group corresponds  to  the  total  VOC  emissions  generated  by  the bodywork/assembly  plants  divided  by  the  total  painted surface area.\n\n## Waste\n\nThe  waste  reported  is  the  waste  that  leaves  the  site's geographical scope; the quantities are expressed in metric tons.  It  includes  hazardous  waste  (HW),  non-hazardous waste (NHW), and worksite waste.\n\nWorksite waste is waste generated during the disinvestment, modernisation or transformation of workshops  or  during  the  construction  or  destruction  of buildings.  This  waste  is  reported  separately  from  process waste  and  is  not  included  in  the  construction  of  waste performance monitoring indicators and targets.\n\nFor the sake of clarity, non-hazardous waste is presented in two subcategories:\n\n- \u25cf scrap metal from production processes (offcuts, machining chips, etc.);\n- \u25cf non-scrap metal (mixed ordinary waste, for example).\n\nFoundry  waste  is  waste  specifically  related  to  the  foundry process. As such, mixed non-hazardous waste produced by a foundry is not considered foundry waste.\n\nNon-recycled  waste  is  waste  for  which  the  treatment network is designated by European treatment codes D or R1 (energy recovery).\n\nRecovered  waste  is  all  waste  that  is  recycled  (material recovery)  or  incinerated  with  energy  recovery  (energy recovery, treatment code R1).\n\nI\n\n02",

However, the data indicated does not include the propane used  by  forklift  trucks  or  the  fuel  consumed  by  the  site (engine and gearbox testing, company vehicles).\n\nThe primary or converted energy supplied to third parties is not  included.  The  purpose  of  the  energy  consumption indicators  is  to  reflect  the  energy  performance  of  the Group's manufacturing processes.\n\nThe LHVs are consistent with Regulation (EU) 2018/2066 on the  monitoring  and  reporting  of  carbon  dioxide  emissions, with the exception of LHV of natural gas from the Spanish\n\nplants from the March 2023 (Spanish) national greenhouse gas  inventory  report.  The  LHVs  are  consistent  with  the emissions reported in the EU Emissions Trading Scheme.\n\nThe share of renewable energy corresponds to the quantity of  energy  consumed  from  primary  energies  of  renewable origin divided by the total energy consumed. The renewable energy sources considered are solar, wind, hydro, geothermal  and  biomass.  For  electricity,  the  quantities produced  and  self-consumed  on  sites  are  taken  into account  as  well  as  the  quantities  determined  using  the percentages  of  renewable  energies  in  the  energy  mix  of purchased  electricity  published  directly  by  suppliers  or,  if this information is not available, those published by Eurostat for  European  countries  or  by  the  IEA  (International  Energy Agency) for countries outside Europe.",

It collects part of the data for the entire scope and ensures the overall consistency of results;\n- \u25cf a questionnaire is sent to the Clusters. This questionnaire includes  a  number  of  indicators:  headcount  by  gender and  age,  number  of  recruitment  and  redundancies, absenteeism  rate,  number  and  subjects  of  major collective agreements signed during the year, number of employees covered by a collective bargaining agreement and  selected  at  corporate  level  from  the  most  relevant agreements,  total  cumulative  training  hours  in  the  year, training access rate, average training rate per employee and  percentage  of  employees  with  disabilities.  Each\n\nindicator has a specific definition and calculation method that is shared with each of the Clusters. This questionnaire  also  enables  data  to  be  cross-referenced with last year's figures to monitor developments;\n\n- \u25cf for  the  data  specific  to  health  and  safety  (number  of occupational accidents, commuting  accidents  and occupational illnesses), a reporting process with monthly consolidation is put in place with the Group entities. Each month, the data are checked at the corporate level using the  protocol  to  ensure  the  quality  of  their  classification. A digital reporting tool is being rolled out, contributing to improving the reliability of data.\n- A  continuous  improvement  process  for  these  collection methods is in place, taking into account the recommendations of the statutory auditors.",

Every  employee  on  the  payroll  is  counted  as  'one' regardless of his or her contractual working time (or activity rate). All employees on the payroll are counted, even if they are sent to another entity.\n\nAverage Group workforce = (Group workforce at 31  December  of  the  previous  year  +  Group  workforce  at 31 December of the current year)/2.\n\nAverage  country  workforce  = (country  workforce  at 31  December  of  the  previous  year  +  country  workforce  at 31 December of the current year)/2.\n\nAverage active workforce: the average active workforce is equal  to  the  total  registered  workforce  for  the  entity concerned,  excluding  'inactive'  employees.  The  active workforce  is  measured  every  month.  The  average  active workforce is equal to the average calculated over 12 months.\n\n'Inactive': persons appearing in the entity's workforce but physically absent from the entity for a long period and paid only partially or not at all. This category consists mainly of unworked  notice  periods,  leave  of  absence  unpaid  for various reasons including long-term parental leave, sabbatical leave, end of professional career leave including exemptions  from  activity  in  France,  leave  for  business creation,  parental  educational leave, absence due to longterm illness or accident after using up the amount of leave paid  by  the  Company  (amount  linked  to  the  current  work absence),  and  military  service.  Persons  on  sick  leave (excluding  long-term)  and  on  maternity  or  paternity  leave are not considered as 'inactive' employees.\n\nNumber of Group redundancies: termination of permanent contract or early termination of fixed-term contract by the employer  for  one  or  more  reasons  that  may  or  may  not relate  personally  to  the  employee  in  question,  and  which may  be  either  collective or individual. Conventional severance,  voluntary  departure  plans,  non-continuation  at the end of a trial period, and abandonment of post are not considered as redundancy.\n\nNumber  of  Group  recruitments: hiring on  permanent contract and fixed-term contracts.\n\nTop governing bodies: positions  comprising  members of the Leadership Team, CMC (Corporate Management Committee) and BMC (Brand Management Committee).\n\nSenior  Management  Positions : Positions  of  responsibility: positions reaching a certain level of responsibility according to the Korn  Ferry  job  evaluation  methodology.  This represents 4,000 positions, within the scope deployed in the People@Renault tool (excluding RRG)..\n\nManagement Positions : positions of responsibility: positions reaching  a  certain  level  of  responsibility  according  to  the Korn Ferry job evaluation methodology. This represents 10% of  the  Group's  positions  in  the  scope  defined  in  the People@Renault tool (excluding Avtovaz RRG), i.e. 11,000 positions.\n\nNumber of hours of training: cumulative number of training hours delivered, whether the training is provided on site by internal/external trainers, outside the company by a training organisation, or followed remotely. This indicator measures the overall training effort.\n\nTraining access rate :  number of employees trained at least once during the year who are still with the Company at the end of the year, as a percentage of the active workforce at year-end.\n\nAverage  training  hours  per  employee: total  hours  of employee training carried out during the year for employees present at the end of the year, as a percentage of the active workforce at the end of the year.\n\nEmployment rate of people with disabilities: percentage of employees  with  disabilities  in  the  total  workforce  as  of 31 December. It should be noted, however, that it is difficult to prepare  statistics  that  accurately  reflect  the  number  of employees with disabilities,  given  the  different  regulations and  the  lack  of  legal  reporting  requirements  in  numerous countries.\n\nAbsenteeism  (absence  due  to  unforeseen  circumstances):\n\nthe  absenteeism rate is expressed as a percentage and is calculated  on  the  basis  of  the  average  active  workforce (permanent  +  fixed-term  contracts)  and  the  theoretical yearly number of working days.\n\nThe  number  of  days  of  absence  is  expressed  in  working days,  excluding  days  of  furloughs,  layoffs,  strikes,  training and leave (including maternity and paternity leave).\n\nFormula: number  of  absence  days  per  year/(active workforce x number of theoretical days per year) x 100.\n\nThe choice of assumptions for the calculation of theoretical days number is left up to the entities, since local factors may result in minor differences.\n\n## Health and safety indicators\n\nFR1: frequency  rate  of  occupational  accidents  requiring more significant medical treatment than first aid for Renault and temporary workers. This rate corresponds to a defined list  of  injuries  that  reach  or  exceed  a  certain  severity threshold and on which Renault Group intends to prioritise its actions.\n\nFR2 : frequency rate of occupational accidents with lost time for Renault employees and temporary workers (a few cases of exclusion in addition to F2).\n\nFR1  and  FR2  correspond  to  the  incident  rates  divided  by 1,000,000 hours worked.\n\nExample:\n\nFR2 =\n\nNumber of lost-time occupational accidents\n\n\u00d7 1,000,000\n\nNumber of hours of risk exposure\n\nAccidents of temporary workers are included in the FR1 and FR2 indicators from 2018.\n\nG1 severity rate: [number of days off work over the year due to  occupational  accidents  during  the  year  or  in  previous years - number of days off work due to accidents that were contested or where a dispute was won] \u00d7 1,000 / number of\n\n02",

This information includes:\n\n- \u25cf actions that are divided into four main areas: education, road safety, integration through employment  and 'others'.  The  purpose  of  each  initiative  determines  the category to which it is assigned. For example, donating a vehicle  for  transporting  children  to  school  would  be classified under 'education';\n- \u25cf Renault s.a.s. sponsorship initiatives (see 2.3.3.5.).\n\nThe various ESG initiatives undertaken internally by Renault Group employees (disability awareness, etc.) are included in societal investments.\n\nOn the other hand, donations in kind (in particular, donations and  loans  of  vehicles)  and  the  provision  of  employees (hourly  cost)  are  not  included  in  societal  investments. However,  for  information  purposes,  the  453  vehicles donated  in  2023  by  the  Engineering  Department  to firefighters in France and abroad as well as to the GIGN and RAID, will give rise to a tax receipt of \u20ac1.767 million.\n\n## 2.6.3.2 Organisations supported by the Renault Corporate Foundation in 2023\n\n| Topic     | Name                                    |\n|-----------|-----------------------------------------|\n| Inclusion |                                         |\n|           | 60,000 Rebonds                          |\n|           | Afeji                                   |\n|           | Arc\u00e9 Avenir Femmes                      |\n|           | Arp\u00e8ge insertion                        |\n|           | Article 1                               |\n|           | C'Possible                              |\n|           | Ecoles de production                    |\n|           | Emma\u00fcs Connect                          |\n|           | Entourage                               |\n|           | Entrepreneurs du monde                  |\n|           | Fondation Georges Besse                 |\n|           | Habitat et Humanisme                    |\n|           | Institution Nationale des Invalides     |\n|           | La Croix Rouge Fran\u00e7aise                |\n|           | La Table de Cana                        |\n|           | Le Refuge                               |\n|           | Les Ailes du Succ\u00e8s                     |\n|           | Les Restos du C\u0153ur                      |\n|           | R\u00e9seau Initiative France                |\n|           | Secours Populaire Fran\u00e7ais              |\n|           | Solidarit\u00e9 Nouvelle face au Ch\u00f4mage     |\n|           | Sortir de prison, int\u00e9grer l'entreprise |\n|           | Sport dans la Ville                     |\n|           | Time2Start                              |\n|           | UNHCR                                   |\n|           | Union Nationale des Missions Locales    |\n|           | Wave                                    |\n\n## 2.6.4 Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) Index\n\nRenault Group decided to adopt the SASB standard from the 2020 financial year.\n\nThe  SASB  is  a  standard  setter  that  is  part  of  the  IFRS Foundation.  It  defines  material  sustainability  reporting standards  by  industrial  sector,  primarily  for  investors  (i.e. issues  that  could  reasonably  have  a  material  impact  on financial performance).\n\nThe SASB has developed a comprehensive set of 77 industry manufacturing standards that were published in November 2018. They identify a minimum  set of sustainable development  themes  and  associated  indicators  that  a company  characteristic  of  an  industry  segment  should publish because of their materiality.\n\nI\n\n02",

However,  these  procedures  were  more  in-depth,  particularly  regarding  the number of tests.\n\nThe sample selected represents between 45% and 100% of the environmental and employee health and safety information.\n\nWe believe that these procedures enable us to express reasonable assurance on the Performance Indicators.\n\n## Preparation of the extra-financial performance declaration\n\nThe lack of  a  generally  accepted  and  commonly  used  reference  framework or  established  practices  on  which  to  base  the assessment and measurement of the Information means that different, but acceptable,  measurement techniques may be used, which may affect comparability between entities and over time.\n\nTherefore,  the  Information  must  be  read  and  understood  with  reference  to  the  Guidelines,  the  main  points  of  which  are presented in the Declaration.\n\n## Inherent limitations in preparing the Information\n\nThe Information may be subject to uncertainty inherent to the state of scientific and economic knowledge and the quality of external data used. Some information is sensitive to the choice of methodology and the assumptions or estimates used for its preparation and presented in the Declaration.\n\nI\n\n02",

Our work was carried out at the level of the consolidating company.\n- \u25cf we  verified  that  the  Declaration  covers  the  scope  of  consolidation,  i.e.  all  the  consolidated  entities  in  accordance  with Article L. 233 of the French Commercial Code within the limitations set out in the Declaration;\n- \u25cf we  obtained  an  understanding  of  internal  control  and  risk  management  procedures  the  Company  has  put  in  place and assessed the data collection process to ensure the completeness and fairness of the Information;\n- \u25cf for the key performance indicators and other quantitative outcomes that we considered to be the most important presented in the Appendix 1, we implemented:\n- -analytical procedures to verify the proper consolidation of the data collected and the consistency of any changes in those data;\n- -detailed  tests,  using  sampling  techniques  or  other  means  of  selection,  in  order  to  verify  the  proper  application  of  the definitions  and  procedures  and  reconcile  the  data  with  the  supporting  documents.  This  work  was  carried  out  on  a selection of contributing entities 46 and covers between 45% and 100% of the consolidated data selected for these tests;\n- -we assessed the overall consistency of the Declaration based on our knowledge of all the consolidated entities.\n\nThe procedures performed for a moderate assurance engagement are less extensive than those required for a reasonable assurance  engagement  performed  in  accordance  with  the  professional  doctrine  of  the  Compagnie  nationale  des commissaires aux comptes.

The potential recommendations from this code which have not been followed are shown in a section (see chapter 3.1.8 of the Universal registration document).\n\nThe  AFEP-MEDEF Code is available  for  consultation  on  the Company's website.\n\n## 3.1 Composition, preparation and organisation of the Board of Directors\n\nThis  chapter  describes  the  method  for  managing  and directing  Renault  S.A.  as  a  listed  company  and  the  parent company  of  Renault  Group.  This  management  method  is also applicable to Renault s.a.s, a subsidiary of Renault S.A. and  the  holding  company  for  Renault  Group's  automotive and financial businesses.\n\n## 3.1.1 Governance structure\n\n## Mode of governance\n\nDuring its meeting of January 24, 2019, the Board of Directors decided to separate the offices of Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer. The Board of Directors considers that this governance structure remains appropriate to Renault's challenges. It enables the Company to benefit from both the Chairman's stature and expertise  in  corporate  governance  and  the  managerial background and industrial and automotive expertise of the Chief Executive Officer, in charge of the management and the implementation of the Company's strategic plan.\n\nThe  operating  principles  and  missions  of  the  Board  of Directors  are  described  in  the  Board  Charter,  which  is available  in  full  on  Renault  Group's  website.  The  main contents of the Board Charter are reproduced below.\n\nThe office of Chairman of the Board of Directors was entrusted to Mr. Jean-Dominique Senard on January 24, 2019, following his appointment  as  a  Director 1 pursuant  to  the  provisions  of Article L. 225-17 par. 3 of the French Commercial Code.\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors,  at  its  meeting  of  January  28,  2020, appointed  Mr.  Luca  de  Meo  as  Chief  Executive  Officer  of Renault  S.A.  and  Chairman  of  Renault  s.a.s,  effective July  1,  2020.  Since  May  11,  2023,  Mr.  Luca  de  Meo  was  also appointed  Director  by  the  Annual  General  Meeting  of Renault S.A.",

It  shall  also  take  into  account  the Company's purpose ( raison d'\u00eatre ).\n\nIn addition, the Board Charter limits the powers of the Chief Executive Officer as follows:\n\n## Excerpt of the Board Charter provisions governing the limitations on the powers of the Chief Executive Officer\n\nThe  Chief  Executive  Officer  must  obtain  the  authorisation  of  the Board  of  Directors  for  any  external  growth  transaction  and  any acquisition or disposal of any ownership in any company, whether existing or to be created, where the amount exceeds \u20ac250 million.\n\nThe  Chief  Executive  Officer  must  inform  the  Board  of  Directors  of any external growth transaction and any acquisition or disposal of any ownership in any company, whether existing or to be created, where the amount exceeds \u20ac60 million.\n\n## Chief Executive Officer's obligation to hold shares\n\nPursuant to the recommendations of the AFEP-MEDEF Code, the  Board  of  Directors  decided  at  its  meeting  on  July  29, 2020, to set the minimum number of shares to be held by the Chief Executive Officer until the end of his term of office at 5,000 shares.\n\nThis minimum holding obligation complements the obligation for the Chief Executive Officer to retain, until the end of his term of office, 25% of the shares resulting from the\n\nThe Board of Directors shall determine every year the total amount of sureties (cautions), endorsements  (avals) or guarantees (garanties), which the Chief Executive Officer may provide without requesting the Board's specific authoriation.\n\nallocation  of  performance  shares  (for  more  details  on  the retention  obligation,  see  chapter  3.2.4.2  of  the  Universal registration document).\n\nThe  minimum  holding  requirement  ensures  that  a  Chief Executive  Officer  who  does  not  yet  own  shares  resulting from free allocations of shares is aligned with the interests of shareholders upon taking office\n\n## 3.1.2 Composition of the Board of Directors\n\nThe members of the Board of Directors are appointed by the Annual General Meeting, except the Director designated  by  the  French  State,  pursuant  to  Article  4  of French Order No. 2014-948 of August 20, 2014, on corporate governance  and  equity  transactions  in  companies  with French State shareholding, and the Directors representing the employees.\n\nThe term of office for Directors is four years. Pursuant to the recommendations of the AFEP-MEDEF Code, these terms of office  are  staggered, to avoid them all ending and coming up for renewal at the same time.\n\n## Excerpt of the Board Charter provisions governing the composition of the Board of Directors\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors  determines  and  regularly  reviews  the desirable  balance  of  its  composition,  particularly  in  terms  of diversity  (representation  of  women  and  men,  nationalities,  age, qualifications and professional experiences).\n\n## Procedure for appointing Directors\n\nPursuant to the Company's articles of association and the legal and regulatory provisions applicable to it, the Board of Directors is composed of:\n\n- \u25cf 3 to 14 directors appointed by the Annual General Meeting\n\n## \u25cf Appointment of independent director\n\nIn  case  of  a  vacancy  of  one  or  more  offices  of  the independent directors or when the Board has expressed its  desire  to  expand  or  change  its  membership,  the Governance and Compensation Committee defines the profile sought with regard to its diversity policy and the required  skills  that  have  been  identified,  in  particular during  the  annual  evaluation  of  the  operation  of  the Board  and  its  committees.

This  director  is appointed by the Minister for the Economy.\n\n## \u25cf 3 directors elected by the employees\n\nPursuant to the Company's  articles of association, three directors are elected directly by the employees of the French subsidiaries, divided into different electorates. One seat is allocated to the 'Engineers - White collars and similar staff' electorate and two seats to the 'Other Employees' electorate.\n\nThe candidates or candidate lists may be presented either by one or more representative organisations as defined by the applicable regulations, or by 100 voters.\n\nTo  be  considered  eligible,  candidates  must  have  an employment contract with, and be actively employed by, the Company or one of its direct or indirect subsidiaries whose registered office is located in France for at least two years prior to the effective date of the term of office of the position for which the election is being held.\n\nThe number, place and composition of the polling stations are  determined  by  the  Company's  establishments  and subsidiaries concerned thereby, in accordance with current practices for the election of employee representatives.\n\n## \u25cf 1 director representing employee shareholders\n\nPursuant to the Company's bylaws, a member representing employee  shareholders,  and  an  alternate,  are  elected  by the  Ordinary  General  Meeting  from  among  two  full candidates  and  two  alternate  candidates  nominated  by employee shareholders.\n\nEach  full  candidate  is  designated,  respectively,  along  with his or her alternate, by:\n\n- \u25cf the  Supervisory  Boards  of  company  mutual  investment funds (FCPE) whose assets are composed of shares of the Company,  in  accordance  with  Article  L.  214-165  of  the French  Monetary  and  Financial  Code,  and  whose  unit holders are current or former employees of the Company or of an affiliated company as defined in Article L. 225-180 of the French Commercial Code and\n- \u25cf employees of the Company or of an affiliated company as defined in Article L. 225-180 of the French Commercial Code who  directly  hold  registered  shares  of  the  Company  (i) following free share allocations made under Article L. 225197-1 of the French Commercial Code and authorised by a decision  of  the  Extraordinary  General  Meeting  after August  7,  2015,  (ii)  within  the  framework  of  the  employee savings  plan  or  (iii)  acquired  under  Article  31-2  of  French Order 2014-948 of August 20, 2014, on the governance and capital transactions of companies with public shareholding  and  Article  11  of  Law  No.  86-912  of  6  August 1986 on privatisation, in the version applicable prior to the entry into force of the above-mentioned Order.\n\n## Onboarding and training program for directors\n\nNew directors  benefit  from  an  onboarding  program  in  the period following their appointment.

In  addition,  the new directors take part in visits to Group sites and factories.\n\nThe  three  directors  representing  employees  and  the director  representing  employee  shareholders  benefit  from in-house training provided by Renault Group employees and training  provided  by  external  organisations.  This  training helps them to fully exercise their office by rapidly acquiring the specific skills required of a company director.\n\n## Diversity policy applied to the Board of Directors\n\nPursuant  to  Article  L.  22-10-10  of  the  French  Commercial Code, the Board, of Directors has defined a diversity policy based on its past practices.\n\n## Policy criteria\n\nThe composition of the Board of Directors seeks a balance notably in terms of diversity (representation of women and men,  nationalities,  age,  qualifications  and  professional experience). More specifically:\n\n- \u25cf regarding the size of the Board of Directors, the number of Board  of  Directors  members  must  be  such  as  to  enable reconciliation of the skills, independence and specificities of Renault's shareholding;\n- \u25cf the Board of Directors, while complying at least with legal requirements  and  the  recommendations  of  the  AFEPMEDEF Code in terms of gender balance, considers that it benefits  from  being  diverse  in  its  composition  (gender, nationality, culture);\n- \u25cf in  terms  of  skills,  the  Company  seeks  above  all  the complementarity  of  skills,  profiles  and  experiences  but also their relevance to the Company's strategy and to the challenges it faces;\n- \u25cf in  terms  of  seniority,  the  Company  seeks  a  balance between  experience  within  the  Board  of  Directors  and progressive renewal of its composition;\n- \u25cf the Board of Directors expects a high level of commitment and ethics from each of its members.\n\n## Policy implementation\n\nTo implement this diversity policy, the Board of Directors uses annual evaluations of its work (for more details on the Board's evaluation,  see  section  3.1.7  of  the  Universal  registration document).  The  progressive  and  planned  renewal  of  the terms of offices makes it possible to anticipate the skills to be renewed  or  to  evolve  according  to  the  evolution  of  the industry and of the markets in which the Company operates.\n\nImplementation of the diversity policy in 2023:\n\n- \u25cf the Board of Directors currently includes 16 Directors. This number remains higher than the average for CAC  40  companies,  but  is  explained  by  the  level  of representation  of  the  employees  and  of  the  reference shareholders  in  accordance  with  the  law,  the  articles  of association  or  agreements  entered  into  with  Nissan,  and\n\nthe  desire  to  ensure  the  presence  of  a  majority  of Independent Directors. As such, the independence rate of the Board of Directors as of December 31; 2023, was 58.3% 2\n\n- \u25cf the  number  of  women  on  the  Board  of  Directors  as  of December 31, 2023, stands at five, i.e. a feminisation rate of  41.7% 3 . Moreover,  one  of  the  Board  of  Directors' committee is chaired by a woman;\n- \u25cf the Board of Directors includes five different nationalities and half  of  Directors  have  an  international  extensive experience acquired through activities in various parts of the world ;\n- \u25cf three  Directors  representing  employees  and  one  Director representing  employee  shareholders  are  fully  associated in the work of the Board of Directors and its committees. In addition,  their  professional  background  as  well  as  their trade union activity within Renault Group gives them a solid knowledge of the Group's organisation and activities;\n- \u25cf the  changes  in  the  composition  of  the  Board  and  of  its committees are part of the continuing implementation of this diversity policy of the Board of Directors.\n\nWith  the  exception  of  the  Directors  appointed  on  the proposal  of  Nissan  and  the  Directors  designated  by  the French  State,  no  contracts  or  agreements  have  been concluded with the shareholders, clients, suppliers, or other parties  allowing  any  of  these  persons  or  one  of  their representatives to be selected as a member of the Board or other  Senior  Management  body  in  the  Company,  thus mitigating potential or actual conflicts of interest.\n\n## Diversity policy applied to Senior Management\n\nThe  Board  of  Director  monitors  the  deployment  of  the Group's  diversity  policy  by  the  Senior  Management.  In  this respect,  the  Board  of  Directors  and  the  Strategy  and Sustainability  Committee  annually  review  the  Group's diversity  and  inclusion  policy,  and  more  specifically  the policy  on  the  balanced  representation  of  women  and  men on the governing bodies.\n\nAt its meeting on February 18, 2021, the Board of Directors, on the proposal of the Executive Management, set a target of 30%  representation  of  women  in  Management  bodies, including  the  Leadership  Team,  the  Brand  Management Committees, and Ampere's Leadership Team, by 2030, 35% by  2035  and  50%  by  2050,  on  the  one  hand,  and  for employees in management positions, on the other.\n\nIn addition,  to  take  into  account  the  new  objectives introduced  by  the  'Rixain  Law'  (Law  n o . 2021-1774  of December  24,  2021,  aimed  at  accelerating  economic  and professional  equality),  the  Board  of  Directors,  on  the proposal  of  the  Executive  Management,  increased  the gender diversity objective within the management bodies to 30% of women by 2025.\n\nAs its  meeting on February 14, 2024, the Board of Directors was informed of the results achieved at the end of the 2023 financial year and the procedures that the Company has put in place  to  achieve  these  objectives.  Regarding  the objective of 30% women in senior management positions, it was  reached  by  the  end  of  2023  (35.6%),  while  the representation  of  women  in  management  positions  was 27.2%, up to 1.7 points compared with 2022.",

In  this  respect,  the directors  representing  the  employees  and  employee shareholders  do  not  personally  receive  compensation (which is passed on to their respective trade unions); they are therefore not required to hold a significant number of shares in  the  Company. Furthermore, legislation prohibits directors designated by the French State from personally owning shares.\n\nFor the retention  obligation  applicable  to  the  Chief Executive Officer, see chapter 3.2 of the Universal registration document.\n\n- \u25cf been  the  subject  of  any  charge  and/or  official  public sanction  pronounced  by  a  statutory  or  regulatory authority; or\n- \u25cf been prevented by a court from acting as a member of an administrative,  management,  or  supervisory  body  of  an issuer, or from taking part in managing or conducting the business of an issuer.\n\n## 3.1.4.3 No potential or actual conflicts of interest\n\nTo  the  best  of  the  Company's  knowledge,  there  is  no potential  or  actual  conflict  of  interest  between  any  of  the private interests of the Company directors and their duties towards the Company.\n\nThere are no family ties between the members of the Board of Directors.\n\nThe corporate officers are not bound to the Company or any of  its  subsidiaries  by  a  service  contract  providing  for  any form of benefit to be granted.\n\nI\n\n03",

Conversely,  the  Board  may consider  that  a  director  who  does  not  meet  the  aforementioned criteria should nevertheless be considered as independent.\n\nPursuant to the Board Charter, the Board of Directors refers to the criteria set forth in the AFEP-MEDEF Code to identify situations that may compromise the exercise of freedom of judgment by directors.\n\nIn any event, it is recalled that, pursuant to the AFEP-MEDEF Code  and  in  accordance  with  the  Board  Charter,  every director  is  under  an  obligation  to  inform  the  Board  of Directors of any potential conflict of interest situation and to refrain from attending the debate and from participating in the vote of the corresponding deliberation.\n\nEach  year,  the  Company  sends  a  questionnaire  to  each director  in  order  to  assess  his  or  her  independence  in accordance with the criteria of the AFEP-MEDEF Code.\n\nThe  Governance  and  Compensation  Committee  and  the Board  of  Directors  shall  also  review  the  classification  of each director as independent in light of these same criteria.\n\nEach  year,  the  Governance  and  Compensation  Committee  shall discuss  for  each  director,  whether  such  director  should  be considered as independent, and the independence of each director shall be examined on a case-by-case basis by the Board of Directors in  light  of  the  criteria  set  forth  in  the  AFEP-MEDEF  Code.  Upon appointment of a new director or renewal of the terms of office a director, the question of whether such director may be considered as independent should also be discussed.\n\nAs  part  of  this  review,  the  Governance  and  Compensation Committee  and  the  Board  of  Directors  pays  particular attention  to  the  assessment  of  the  materiality  of  the business  relationships  between  the  directors  and  the Company, both from the standpoint of the Group and of the relevant director. This assessment shall be carried out in the light  of  qualitative  criteria,  such  as  the  nature  of  the business relationships, and quantitative criteria, such as the amounts committed under these relationships.\n\nAccordingly,  to  qualify  as  independent,  the  Board  of Directors ensures that there were no significant cash flows between  the  Company  and  any  company  of  which Company's directors are directors or Executive Officers, in particular by examining the share these companies account for in the Company's revenue.",

1 of the AFEP-MEDEF Code, given his capacity  as  director  of  Nissan  and  Chairman  of  Renault s.a.s. for the period from October 11, 2019 to June 30, 2020.\n\nThe  AFEP-MEDEF  Code  states  that  one  of  the  criteria  that the  Board  of  Directors  must  assess  to  possibly  exclude someone from the status of independent director is that of ' not  being  or  not  having  been,  during  the  past  five  years,  an employee,  executive  offer,  or  director  of  a  company  that  the company consolidates .'  According to the AFEP-MEDEF Code implementation  guide,  this  recommendation  also  applies when a director holds 'an office in a company in which the first company holds a non-controlling but significant stake, or in a sister company'.\n\nIt is recalled that Nissan is not a company fully consolidated by Renault and  the interest in Nissan is accounted using the equity method (for more details on Renault's shareholding in Nissan,  see  note  12  in  chapter  5.2.2.6.2  of  the  Universal registration document).\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors,  upon  recommendation  of  the Governance  and  Compensation  Committee,  held  that  the appointment of the Chairman of the Board of Directors as a representative of Renault to the Board of Directors of Nissan, was  not  such  as  to  call  into  question  Mr.  Jean-Dominique\n\nSenard's  freedom  of  judgement  and  independence  with respect to Renault.\n\nFurthermore, should such a situation give rise to any conflict of  interest,  the  provisions  of  the  Board  Charter  requiring the  director  in  question  to  abstain  from  participating  in the  deliberations  and  votes  of  the  Board  of  Directors would apply.\n\nIn addition, the Board of Directors, on the recommendation of the  Governance and Compensation Committee, considered that  the  performance  by  Mr.  Jean-Dominique  Senard  of  the duties of Chairman of Renault s.a.s. from October 11, 2019, to June  30,  2020,  was  of  an  exceptional  and  purely  temporary nature, during the time required for the Board of Directors to conduct  the  succession  process  for  the  Chief  Executive Officer and until the arrival of Mr. Luca de Meo on July 1, 2020. The  Board  of  Directors  therefore  considered  that  this exceptional situation was not such as to call into question the independence  of  Mr.  Jean-Dominique  Senard  at  the  end  of this temporary term of office.\n\nAt  its  meeting  of  February  14,  2024,  the  Board  of  Directors also  reviewed  Mr.  Pierre  Fleuriot's  situation  with  regard  to criterion  no.  1  of  the  AFEP-MEDEF  Code  in  view  of  his capacity as director of Nissan.\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors,  upon  recommendation  of  the Governance  and  Compensation  Committee,  held  that  the\n\nI",

Furthermore,  the  Board  of Directors  make,  at  least  once  every  three  years,  a  formal evaluation with the assistance of external and independent consultants.  Thus,  for  the  2023  financial  year,  the  Board  of Directors,  upon  recommendation  of  the  Governance  and Compensation Committee, appointed an independent firm to carry out a formal evaluation of the work of the Board and its committees.  This  also  included  an  assessment  of  the individual contributions of the directors.\n\nThe Governance and Remuneration Committee has ensured that  the  external  consultancy  firm  is  independent  of  the Company and its directors.\n\nAll  Board  members  completed  a  questionnaire  and  then  met individually  with  the  external  consultants.  The  conclusions  of the  evaluation  were  presented  to  the  Governance  and Compensation Committee at its meeting on February 8,  2024 and to the Board of Directors at its meeting on February 14, 2024.\n\nThe  purpose  of  the  questionnaire  and  the  interviews  with Board members was to assess the following topics:\n\n- \u25cf the composition, role, missions, structure and operation of the Board of Directors and its committees;\n- \u25cf the  relationship  between  the  Board  of  Directors  and Executive Management;\n- \u25cf the individual contribution of each director and collective effectiveness; and\n- \u25cf follow-up  of  the  areas  for  improvement  identified  in  the previous evaluation.\n\nThe  evaluation  provided  an  opportunity  to  draw  lessons from  the  previous  external  evaluation  in  2020,  and  to  reexamine the operating procedures of the Board of Directors and its committees.\n\nSince 2020, the main changes have been :\n\n- \u25cf strengthening  the  ties  and  cohesion  between  the members of the Board of Directors;\n- \u25cf improving the quality of the work of the Board of Directors (quality  of  discussions,  introduction  of  new  processes and improved reporting of meetings);\n- \u25cf strengthening  the  ties  between  the  Board  and  the Executive Management and a better balance of roles ;\n- \u25cf the time devoted to dealing with key issues (strategic, risk management and CSR) at meetings;\n\nThe evaluation highlighted the following positive points:\n\n- \u25cf the  important  contribution  of  the  Committee  Chairmen and  the  commitment  of  the  employee  directors  on  the Board;\n- \u25cf the  alignment  between  the  vision  of  the  Board  of Directors  and  that  of  the  Executive  Management  in strategic and ESG matters;\n- \u25cf strong financial expertise in the Board;\n- \u25cf greater knowledge of the automotive sector;\n- \u25cf the  quality  of  preparation  for  Board  and  Committee meetings.\n\nThe  evaluation  also  identified  recommendations  and challenges for the future, including\n\n- \u25cf the long-term alignment of directors' skills with the future challenges  of  the  automotive  sector,  in  particular  by seeking  profiles  with  expertise  in  ESG,  new  mobility, technology and software, and artificial intelligence;;\n- \u25cf increasing the gender balance on the Board of Directors;\n- \u25cf more in-depth consideration at the long-term succession processes at Board and Executive Management level;\n- \u25cf long-term monitoring and evaluation of recent strategic decisions.",

In  its  recommendations,  the Governance  and  Compensation  Committee  takes  into account  the  balance  of  the  different  components  of  the corporate officers' compensation.\n\nThe  compensation  policy  for  the  non-executive  corporate officer  is  based  on  a  fixed  compensation  and  does  not include any variable or exceptional compensation in cash or in shares, nor compensation for directorship.\n\nThe compensation policy for the executive corporate offic.er is based on six simple, stable, transparent practices:\n\n- 1. Closely linked to the Company's strategy\n- 2. Performance-oriented\n- 3. Focus on long-term performance\n- 4. Close alignment with shareholders' interests\n- 5. Competitive compensation\n- 6. Compensation which does not encourage excessive risk-taking\n- \u25cf The  setting  of  performance  targets,  a  sufficiently  long  evaluation  period,  and compensation capping allow excessive short-term risk-taking to be avoided.\n\nThese  principles  are  established  in  compliance  with  the recommendations  of  the  AFEP-MEDEF  Code  to  which  the Company  refers  pursuant  to  the  provisions  of  Article L. 22-10-10 of the French Commercial Code.\n\nMore generally, the Governance  and  Compensation Committee  regularly  ensures  that  corporate  officers' compensation  complies  with  all  applicable  laws  and recommendations in terms of corporate governance.\n\nI\n\n- \u25cf The  compensation  is  closely  linked  to  the  implementation  and  results  of the strategy.\n- \u25cf The variable component of the executive officer's compensation represents a fraction of  the  total  compensation  that  is  consistent  with  market  practice  and  ensures  the interests of the executive officer are aligned with the Company's performance.\n- \u25cf A  significant  part  of  the  executive  officers'  compensation  depends  on  multi-year targets being achieved.\n- \u25cf The number of performance shares allocated to the executive officer is expressed as an absolute number, rather than a percentage of the salary, so that upward and downward fluctuations in the share price affect the corresponding total value.\n- \u25cf The executive officer must retain until the end of his term of office 33% of the shares vested pursuant to performance share plans (25% for the plans allocated until 2023).\n- \u25cf Competition for corporate officers in the automotive market and related activities is intense. It is therefore of prime importance to ensure that the overall compensation of  the  executive  officer  is  competitive  compared  to  the  practices  of  comparable and competing companies.\n\n03",

This  level  has  been  achieved  because the FR2 rate reached 1.48% in 2023.\n- \u25cf Development of the 'ReKnow' University (target of 3,000 people trained in 2023) (15%):\n\nMore than 10,000 people were trained at the ReKnow University in 2023.\n\n- \u25cf Developing the circular economy business: increase the number of used vehicles  and  mechanical  components  reconditioned  at  Flins  in  2023 (10% ) :\n\n54,000 used vehicles were reconditioned at Flins in 2023, compared with 30,684 in 2022.\n\n- c) Customer satisfaction / Quality : 10% (out of a maximum of 10%)\n\nThe two indicators of this performance criterion refer to qualitative targets.\n\nUpon  recommendation  of  the  Governance  and  Compensation Committee, the Board of Directors noted that these two indicators were met or exceeded.\n\n- \u25cf Reduction of the incident rate (improvement of the quality and durability of the Group's products measured in number of cases per thousand (K\u00b0/\u00b0\u00b0) (5%):\n- This indicator, called the 'GMF 3MIS WORLD', measures the number of incidents on vehicles after three months on the road. The objective of reducing  this  rate  was  achieved,  with  the  rate  falling  to  22  K\u00b0/\u00b0\u00b0 against a target of 31 K\u00b0/\u00b0\u00b0.\n- \u25cf Customer  satisfaction  level  measured  by  the  'Dealer  e-reputation' (or digital reputation of the dealers) (5%):\n\nThis  objective  has  been  achieved:  100%  of  countries  are  on  target (36 countries).\n\nAccordingly, the Board of Directors noted that the total achievement rate of  the  performance  criteria  was  150%  for  the  2023  financial  year  and consequently decided to set Mr. Luca de Meo's variable compensation for the 2023 financial year at a gross amount of \u20ac1,950,000.\n\n| Multiyear variable compensation                                   | N/A                                    | The  Chief  Executive  Officer  does  not  receive  any  multi-year  variable compensation.   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Exceptional compensation                                          | N/A                                    | The  Chief  Executive  Officer  does  not  receive  any  exceptional compensation.            |\n| Stock options, performance shares  or any other long-term benefit | 75,000 performance shares = \u20ac1,419,330 | I nital allocation of 75,000 performance shares                                               |\n\nI\n\n03",

This allocation of co-investment shares to the Chief Executive Officer represented 0.003% of the share capital of Renault SA. It is recalled that, out of these 7,790 co-investment shares, the number of shares definitively acquired will depend on the achievement of the following performance criteria: \u25cf total shareholder return (TSR), for a maximum of 20% ; \u25cf Group's operating margin (Group OM), for a maximum of 20%; \u25cf return on capital employed (ROCE), for a maximum of 20%;  \u25cf reduction in incident rates (GMF 3 MIS World), for a maximum of 20%; and \u25cf The reduce of CO2 emissions (Kg per vehicle produced in Europe), for a maximum of 20%. These performance criteria will be assessed over a cumulative period of three years (2024, 2025, 2026).  Acquisition of the co-investment shares is also subject to a condition of presence  of  3  years  minimum  from  the  allocation  date.  Moreover, vested shares are subject to a holding period of at least 5 years from the implementation date of the plan.

For this reason, the Chief Executive Officer receives a lump-sum indemnity equal to the amount of the contribution paid on his behalf to the insurer. Payment of this indemnity to the Chief Executive Officer is concomitant to the payment of the contribution to the insurer and amounted to \u20ac406,250.04 for the 2023 financial year.\n\nThe  contributions  and  lump-sum  indemnity  amounts  will  be  depend on the Company's performance insofar as the calculation basis includes the variable portion of the compensation which is related to the Group's results.\n\n## 3.2.2.3 Achievement rate  of  the  performance  criteria  of  the  long-term  variable compensation  of  the  Chief  Executive  Officer  in  respect  of  the  2021 financial year\n\nIt  is  recalled  that  the  Board  of  Directors  of  April  23,  2021, awarded  the  Chief  Executive  Officer  75,000  performance shares  for  the  2021  financial  year,  in  accordance  with  the compensation  policy  approved  by  the  Annual  General Meeting held on April 23, 2021.\n\nThe number of vested shares is subject to the achievement of the following performance criteria to be assessed over a cumulative period of three years (2021, 2022 and 2023) :\n\n- \u25cf Total Shareholder Return (TSR), for a maximum of 25%;\n\n- \u25cf Free Cash Flow (FCF), for a maximum of 25%;\n- \u25cf The gross income per car annual increase for a maximum of 25% ; and\n- \u25cf The  global  carbon  footprint  (reduction  of  CO2  emissions from Renault Group's passenger and commercial vehicles registered worldwide), for a maximum of 25%.",

The  vesting  of  these shares was also subject to a three-year presence condition from the date of the decision to grant the shares. |\n| Luca de Meo - Chief  Executive  Officer |                               | These 45,421 shares were definitively acquired by Mr Luca de Meo on July 29, 2023 and became available on that same date.                                                                                                                                                                                                         |\n| Luca de Meo - Chief  Executive  Officer |                               | The  Chief  Executive  Officer  is  required  to  retain  25%  of  the  shares arising from performance shares definitively acquired in his capacity as an executive director until the end of his term of office.                                                                                                                |\n\n## 3.2.2.5 Compensation of the directors in 2023\n\nPursuant to the provisions of Article L. 225-45 of the French Commercial Code, the Annual General Meeting on June 15, 2018  set  the  annual  compensation  amount  to  be  divided among  the  directors  for  the  2018  financial  year  and subsequent  financial  years  at  \u20ac1,500,000,  until  the  Annual General Meeting decides otherwise.\n\nThe  compensation  policy  for  directors  sets  a  maximum annual  amount  for  attendance  at  Board  meetings  and meetings of each of the Committees, which include:\n\n- \u25cf a fixed portion prorated according to the duration of the office over the year; and\n- \u25cf a variable portion prorated according to the attendance rate  over  the  total  number  of  meetings  held  during  the year.\n\nIn  compliance  with  the  recommendation  22.1  of  the  AFEPMEDEF Code, the variable portion related to attendance at Board and Committees meetings is predominant compared to the fixed portion.\n\nThis  compensation  policy  for  directors  was  approved  by  the Annual General Meeting of May 11, 2023 (fourteenth resolution).\n\nThe table below shows the rules for calculating directors' compensation in 2023:\n\n| (in euros)         | Annual fixed portion   | Annual variable portion   | Total individual amounts   | Additional annual fixed portion for chairmanship   | Additional annual fixed portion for Lead Independent Director   |\n|--------------------|------------------------|---------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Board of Directors | \u20ac18,000                | \u20ac35,000                   | \u20ac53,000                    | \u20ac0                                                 | \u20ac20,000                                                         |\n| Committees         | \u20ac5,000                 | \u20ac15,000                   | \u20ac20,000                    | \u20ac20,000                                            | -                                                               |\n\nIt  is  reminded  that  the  Chairman  of  the  Board  of  Directors and  the  Chief  Executive  Officer  do  not  receive  any compensation for their directorships.\n\nIt is specified that the three directors representing employees and the director representing employee shareholders hold employment contracts within subsidiaries  of  the  Company  and  receive  in  this  respect  a salary that is not related to the exercise of their directorship. Therefore,  such  salary  will  not  be  disclosed.  The  other directors currently in office did not receive any compensation or benefit of any kind from Renault S.A. or the companies  it  controls  other  than  what  is  indicated  in  the table below.\n\nIn addition, directors are entitled to reimbursement of expenses incurred by them in the exercise of their office, in particular any\n\ntravel  and  accommodation  expenses  in  connection  with meetings of the Board of Directors and of committees.\n\nUnder  the  rules  set  out  in  of  the  compensation  policy approved by the Annual General Meeting of May 11, 2023, the total gross  amount  of  compensation  attributable  to directors for the 2023 financial year amounts to \u20ac1,054,071.\n\nThe  individual  amounts  of  directors'  compensation  are shown  in  the  table  below  and  will  be  paid  in  a  single instalment in 2024.\n\nThese directors' compensation components are part of the information  indicated  in  Article  L.22-10-9  I.  of  the  French Commercial Code and will be submitted to a general vote in accordance  with I of  Article  L.22-10-34  of  the  French Commercial  Code  during  the  Annual  General  Meeting  of May 16, 2024.",

However,  as Renault  S.A.  does  not  have  any  employees,  the  indicators were  calculated  on  the  basis  of  the  compensation  of  the France-based  employees  of  ten  companies,  all  being wholly-owned subsidiaries of Renault S.A. These companies are Renault s.a.s, Sofrastock, RCI Banque SA , Renault Retail Group  (RRG  France),  Alpine  (Dieppe),  SODICAM  2,  Ampere Software,  Ampere  Electricity,  Ampere  S.A.S  and  Ampere Cl\u00e9on.\n\nThe 31,001 individuals who were employed in 2023 by these ten  companies  represent  81%  of  the  Renault  Group's workforce in France as of December 31, 2023.\n\nCompensation presented in the table includes the following components:\n\n- \u25cf fixed compensation paid during the financial year;\n- \u25cf variable compensation paid during the financial year;\n- \u25cf compensation for directorship, if applicable, paid during the financial year;\n- \u25cf book value of the benefits in kind paid during the financial year;\n- \u25cf performance  shares  allocated  during  the  financial  year (at IFRS value);\n- \u25cf Profit-sharing  and  incentive  bonuses  paid  during  the financial year.\n\nCompensations are annualised for employees of these ten companies and for corporate officers of Renault S.A.\n\nThe  corporate  officers  concerned  are  the  Chief  Executive Officer and the Chairman of the Board of Directors.\n\nThe compensation presented relates to the function and not to an individual officer, so that a change of corporate officer for  the  same function does not impact the presentation of the information over the five-year period.",

Already weakened, Renault Group had to cope with the effects of the global pandemic and found itself  in  a  very  deteriorated  financial  situation  (2020  halfyear  results:  automotive  operating  margin  at  \u20ac-1.6  billion, automotive free cash flow at \u20ac-6.4 billion, Group net income at  \u20ac-7.4  billion).  In  July  2020,  the  Board  of  Directors  and  its Chairman, Jean-Dominique Senard, entrusted Luca de Meo with the task of leading the Group's turnaround and defining a  new strategy to respond to the emergence of new value chains,  such  as  electric  vehicles,  software,  new  mobility services  and  the  circular  economy,  in  addition  to  internal combustion and hybrid vehicles.\n\nThe Renaulution strategic plan announced shortly after the start  of  his  mandate,  in  January  2021,  aimed  to  restore  the Group's competitiveness. Thanks to the determination and commitment of the Chief Executive Officer  and  his  teams, the  initial  financial  and  operational  targets  were  achieved ahead of schedule, despite unexpected headwinds (Russia's exit,  semiconductor  crisis,  etc.).  In  less  than  4  years,  the Group has been able to:\n\n- \u25cf return to a solid financial position (resumption of dividend payments as from 2023, change in outlook from negative to  stable  between  2022  and  2023  for  all  financial  credit rating  agencies,  record  operating  margin  and  free  cash flow  in  2023,  early  repayment  of  the  loan  granted  by  a banking pool and guaranteed by the French government.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n(1) Adjusted to reflect the exit from Russia\n\n(2) After IFRS 17 restatement\n\n- \u25cf achieve  a  commercial  repositioning,  thanks  to  a  brand new range of competitive products with 17 launches over 2024 and 2025 as well as a commercial policy focused on value.\n- \u25cf strengthen  employee  commitment  by  involving  them  in the implementation  of  the  Group's  new  strategic orientations,  and  by  creating  the  conditions  for  a  better value  sharing,  through  the  launch  of  a  large-scale employee shareholding plan whose ambition is to reach 10% by 2030 and which has already reached 5.07% at the end  of  2023,  i.e.  +1.6  points  compared  to  employee shareholding level at the end of 2020.\n- \u25cf redefine  the  long-term  partnership  within  the  Alliance with  Nissan  and  Mitsubishi,  based  on  a  pragmatic  and operational approach that creates value for all partners.\n\nIn  2024,  the  Board  of  Directors  wishes  to  renew  its  trust in  Mr  Luca  de  Meo  for  a  new  four-year  term  as  Chief Executive Officer.\n\nI\n\n03",

The Committee  also  took  into  account  in  its  analysis  the  fact that the compensation policy in 2020 had been adapted to the context prevailing at that time and led to a lower level of compensation than peer practice.\n\nThis comprehensive review of the compensation policy comes after  two  one-off  adjustments  in  2022  (introducing  a  coinvestment  plan)  and  2023  (increasing  the  number  of  shares allocated under the long-term incentive plan) which involved, besides  the  Chief  Executive  Officer,  more  than  150  of  the Group's key employees, and which were temporarily implemented in order to support the in-depth transformation of the Group with a view to creating long-term value. However, the  fixed  and  variable  annual  compensation  components remained  unchanged  for  the  entire  duration  of  the  Chief Executive Officer's term of office.\n\nAs part of this review, the Committee wanted to take a longterm view to ensure that the compensation policy responds appropriately to the challenges of attractiveness, retention and alignment with the interests of stakeholders, while also addressing the comments made by certain shareholders at the last Annual General Meeting.\n\nIndeed,  after  analysing  the  votes,  the  Board  of  Directors decided  to  remove  the  co-investment  plan  from  the compensation policy in order to ensure that the compensation components were clearer. Thus, a return to a more  common  scheme  will  meet  the  expectations  of shareholders for greater simplification in the compensation structure.  The  Board  of  Directors  will  continue  to  engage with the Group's various stakeholders to monitor changes in their expectations.\n\nThis  in-depth  analysis  led  to  the  selection  of  three  main objectives  to  guide  the  definition  of  the  terms  of  the  new term of office of the Chief Executive Officer of the Renault Group:\n\n- \u25cf Simplifying the compensation to make it more transparent and easier to monitor;\n- \u25cf Upgrading  the  compensation  to  meet  the  challenges  of attractiveness;\n- \u25cf Aligning  the  compensation  with  the  interests  of  all stakeholders.\n\n## 1. Simplifying the compensation\n\nThis objective of simplification has resulted in the removal of the  co-investment  plan  from  the  compensation  policy  and in a reduction of the number of performance criteria used.\n\nAlthough the co-investment plan was an interesting way of aligning  the  personal  interests  of  executives  with  those  of\n\nshareholders,  it  led  to  the  creation  of  a  large  number  of criteria. The Board of Directors therefore wanted to refocus the  Chief  Executive  Officer's  action  around  three  financial criteria  and  one  sustainable  development  criterion  for  the annual allocation of performance shares.\n\n## 2. Upgrading  the  compensation  to  meet  the  challenges  of attractiveness\n\nThe  second  objective  is  to  upgrade  the  Chief  Executive Officer's compensation package to ensure its attractiveness in  the  face  of  strong  competition  to  attract talented executives with a strategic vision for the future of this fast-changing industry and  with the necessary leadership to implement it over the long term. This need is reinforced  by  the  profile  of  the  Chief  Executive  Officer, unanimously recognised in the global automotive sector.\n\nFirstly,  in  view  of  the  Group's  transformation,  the  Board  of Directors decided to review the composition of the group of peers used as comparables (\"the Panel\").\n\nTo this end, the Governance and Compensation Committee hired a specialized firm to help understanding the trends in the industry and to assist in selecting a relevant panel:\n\n- \u25cf In order to meet the expectations voiced by a number of shareholders,  the  Committee  did  not  include  any  nonEuropean companies in the Panel.\n- \u25cf The  Committee  then  wished  to  reflect  the  Group's strategic  evolutions  by  selecting  companies  not  only  in the  automotive  sector  but  also  in  related  sectors  (autoparts  manufacturers,  software,  electrical)  which  are competing with Renault Group to attract talents.\n- \u25cf Criteria such as number of employees and turnover were taken into account. For these two criteria, Renault Group is positioned around the median of the Panel.\n- \u25cf Given  the  Group's  transformation  and  the  changes observed  within  the  industry,  market  capitalisation  was not a key criteria in the decision-making process. Indeed, although some companies' market capitalisations do not match Renault Group's, they are still legitimately included in the Panel given the nature of their business.\n\nTo ensure that the Chief Executive Officer's compensation is attractive, the second objective is therefore to raise it to the median of a renewed panel.\n\nA  total  of  13  companies  were  selected  for  the  reference Panel:\n\n| Automotive          | Related sectors   |\n|---------------------|-------------------|\n| Stellantis          | Continental       |\n| Volkswagen          | Michelin          |\n| Mercedes Benz Group | Pirelli           |\n| BMW                 | Siemens           |\n| Audi                | SAP               |\n| Volvo               | ABB               |\n| Ferrari             |                   |",

This  objective  of  upgrading  has  been  applied  to  all the components of his compensation:\n\n- \u25cf Setting  the  fixed  annual  compensation  at  \u20ac1.7  million. Before the increase, the fixed  annual  compensation of the Chief  Executive  Officer  was  in  the  bottom  quartile  of  the Panel, which meant that more than 75% of the companies in the Panel offered a higher fixed annual compensation than that  of  the  Chief  Executive  Officer  of  Renault  Group.  After this  increase,  the  Chief  Executive  Officer's  fixed  annual compensation will be positioned at the median of the Panel.\n- \u25cf Aligning the ceiling for the annual variable compensation of  the  Chief  Executive  Officer  with  that  applicable  to Group employees (up to 225%), coupled with an increase in  the  targets  for  reaching  this  upper  limit  in  order  to encourage outperformance. Renault Group white-collars are entitled to a bonus of up to 225% of a calculation base corresponding to a percentage of their fixed salary.\n- \u25cf Increasing the number of performance shares granted as part  of  long-term  compensation  to  120,000  shares.  This increase is still moderate compared with the allocation of a  total  of  105,290  performance  shares  in  2023  (including the co-investment plan in particular).\n\nConsequently, the Chief Executive Officer's total compensation  would  move  from  the  bottom  of  the  first quartile  to  the  bottom  of  the  second  quartile  of  the  Panel. The  Committee  has  decided  to  allocate  a  specific  nonrenewable \"Renaulution plan\" which will position the Chief Executive Officer's total compensation in the middle of the second quartile in order to secure the attractiveness of his compensation, while remaining reasonable compared with compensation  paid  to  other  executives  of  the  groups  of the Panel:\n\n- \u25cf 'Renaulution  Plan'  consisting  of  the  grant  of  shares subject  to  presence  and  performance  conditions  linked to the strategic plan, at the occasion of the renewal of the term  of  office  of  the  Chief  Executive  Officer.  The challenges  facing  the  automotive  industry  require  a change of culture and an in-depth transformation of the Group. This compensation component will ensure that the Chief  Executive  Officer  successfully  implements  the strategic plan over the entire four-year term of office. This plan  corresponds  to  a  maximum  annualised  amount  of \u20ac1.109  million  at  IFRS  value  (i.e.  a  single  allocation  of performance shares totalling \u20ac4.437 million at IFRS value) for the entire term of office.\n\nThe graph hereafter illustrates the positioning of the Chief Executive  Officer's  compensation  compared  with  the Panel.  For  the  sake  of  transparency,  consistency  and readability, the Group presents this compensation\n\npackage  on  the  basis  of  the  maximum  amount  that  can theoretically  be  earned,  whereas  80%  of  the  package  is subject to performance conditions.\n\n## Renault CEO's maximum compensation versus the Panel\n\nLTI: based on IFRS value (2023 grant)\n\nRenaulution Plan: annualised over the term of office\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 3. Aligning  the  compensation  with  the  interests  of  all stakeholders\n\nThe  third  objective  is  to  ensure  that  the  interests  of  all stakeholders are aligned with the adjustments made to the Chief  Executive  Officer's  compensation.  This  objective  is reflected  on  the  one  hand,  in  the  strengthening  of  the employee share ownership programme and the payment of a significantly higher dividend than in the previous year and, on  the  other  hand,  in  the  establishment  of  new  conditions governing  the  holding,  repayment  and  stability  of  the amounts of both the annual variable compensation and of the annual performance share plan.\n\nSince  2022,  Renault  Group  has  embarked  on  a  particularly ambitious  policy  to  develop  employee  share  ownership  as part of the roll-out of the Renaulution strategy, with the aim of 10% of Renault S.A.'s capital being held by employees by 2030.  The  first  two  Renaulution  Shareplan  operations,  in 2022 and 2023, enabled the transfer to Group employees of around  4.8  million  additional  shares,  representing  1.6%  of Renault's share capital. As of December 31, 2023, employees held 5.07% of the share capital.\n\nI\n\n03",

The proposed dividend for the 2023 financial year, which will be submitted  for  approval  to  the  Annual  General  Meeting  on May  16,  2024,  amounts  to  \u20ac1.85  per  share,  representing  an increase of \u20ac1.60 per share compared with last year and a payout ratio of 17.5% of the consolidated net income - Group share 4 .  As  a  reminder,  the  dividend  policy  provides  for  a gradual,  disciplined  increase  in  the  payout  ratio  to  reach 35% of the net profit - Group share, over the medium term. To achieve this, the Group will need to deliver on its 1 st priority: a return to an \"investment grade\" credit rating.\n\nLastly,  alignment  with  long-term  interests  of  shareholders has also been ensured by the adoption of new conditions:\n\n- \u25cf The 'Renaulution Plan' includes:\n- -a presence condition;\n- -a clawback clause;\n\nDuring  the  two  years  following  the  year  of  acquisition (i.e.  2030  at  the  latest),  the  Board  of  Directors  may require the Chief Executive Officer to repay up to 100% of  the  amount  of  the  Renaulution  Plan    as  a  result  of errors or inaccuracies leading to the financial statements being restated (except for reasons owing to accounting standards), in the event of a serious breach of  the  Company's  code  of  conduct  or  disciplinary  or legal  penalties  imposed on the Chief Executive Officer in respect of his duties.\n\n- -a one-year holding period after acquisition\n- 4 Excluding \u20ac880 million in write-offs from the sale of Nissan shares.\n\n- The  shares  are  indeed  subject  to  a  one-year  holding period as from the date of their vesting.\n\nFurthermore,  this  plan  is  not  intended  to  be  renewed during the term of office.\n\n- \u25cf The  performance  share  plans  allocated  from  2024 onwards also include an enhanced obligation to hold the shares  acquired  at  the  end  of  the  vesting  period, increasing from 25% to 33% during the term of office. This holding  requirement  ensures  long-term  alignment  with shareholders' interests.\n- \u25cf The  maximum bonus percentage (225%) will  remain  the same throughout the term of office.\n- \u25cf The  number  of  shares  allocated  each  year  will  remain unchanged at 120,000 throughout the entire term of office.\n\n## Annual fixed compensation\n\nThe  annual  fixed  compensation  of  the  Chief  Executive Officer  is  set  at  a  gross  annual  amount  of  \u20ac1,700,000, payable in twelve monthly instalments.\n\n## Annual variable compensation\n\nThe  amount  of  annual  variable  compensation  may  reach 225%  of  the  fixed  compensation  paid  if  all  of  the performance criteria are fully achieved. The annual variable compensation is fully paid in cash.\n\nFor the 2024 financial year, the performance criteria set by the  Board  of  Directors  include  four  financial  criteria  and three  strategic  and  sustainability  criteria.  The  Board  of Directors  considered  that  these  are  key  indicators  of  the performance of  the  Renault  Group  and  in  particular  in  the implementation of the Renaulution strategic plan.",

The  value  of  the  allotment (estimated in accordance with IFRS standard) represents a maximum  of  \u20ac4,437,000,  this  amount  being  the  allotment ceiling.

The  number  of shares vested may be adjusted downwards accordingly.\n\nBy applying these ceilings at both allocation and vesting, the Board  of  Directors  intends  to  keep  the  amounts  of  the Renaulution Plan under control.\n\nI\n\n03",

They reflect the ambitious strategy based on 4 major objectives:\n\n- 1. Transform Renault Group\n- 2. Drive substantial organic growth by combining profitable partnerships for long-term value creation\n- 3. Pioneer the circular economy and energy transition for sustainable growth\n- 4. Master technological development and be at the forefront of innovation\n\nEach of these 4 objectives has been broken down by perimeter and area of activity, enabling enhanced management and monitoring of the actions undertaken.\n\nIn this way, the Board of Directors wishes to be able to assess the Chief Executive Officer's performance at the end of his term of office in a holistic and demanding way, and not to focus exclusively on numerical indicators which, after four years, could prove to be irrelevant or even cause the Chief Executive Officer to deviate from the course set. In this changing context, the four strategic  objectives  selected,  which  are  distinct  from  the  mainly  quantitative  criteria  already  incorporated  into  the  other components  of  the  compensation  policy,  make  it  possible  to  maintain  the  necessary  distance  while  defining  a  clear  and demanding roadmap. At the end of the performance period, the Board of Directors will carry out an in-depth evaluation, on which it will report publicly to the Group's shareholders and stakeholders.\n\n| Transform Renault  Group                                                      | Drive substantial organic growth combining with  profitable partnerships for long-term  value creation   | Drive substantial organic growth combining with  profitable partnerships for long-term  value creation   | Drive substantial organic growth combining with  profitable partnerships for long-term  value creation   | Pioneer circular economy  and energy transition  for sustainable growth   | Pioneer circular economy  and energy transition  for sustainable growth   | Master technology  development and lead  by innovation Ampere Flexis   | Master technology  development and lead  by innovation Ampere Flexis   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Scope Renault Group                                                           | Renault                                                                                                  | Dacia                                                                                                    | Alpine                                                                                                   | The Future is  Neutral                                                    | Mobilize                                                                  |                                                                        |                                                                        |\n| management  succession plans  embedding diversity.

In  order  to  receive  this  benefit,  the following cumulative conditions should be met over the last two financial years preceding the departure:\n\n- \u25cf a  minimum  total  achievement  rate  of  80%  of  the performance criteria for the annual variable compensation of the Chief Executive Officer;\n- \u25cf achievement of the Group's free cash flow target.\n\n## Non-compete indemnity\n\nAt  its  meeting  held  on  February  13,  2020,  the  Board  of Directors  authorised  the  conclusion  of  a  non-compete agreement with Mr. Luca de Meo.\n\nThe Board of Directors considered that it is in Renault's interest to  enter  into  this  non-compete  agreement  which  protects Renault  Group's  legitimate  interests,  given  the  particularly competitive nature of the automotive market, the importance of the functions and the recognised skills of Mr. Luca de Meo in this  market,  the  means  available  to  him,  and  the  sensitive information he holds and to which he can have access.\n\nUnder this agreement, Mr. Luca de Meo commits, as of the end  of  his  term  of  office  as  Chief  Executive  Officer,  not  to engage,  directly  or  indirectly,  in  an  activity  that  competes with  those  of  the  Group,  on  his  own  behalf,  on  behalf  of companies  in  the  automotive  design,  construction  and marketing  sectors  (mainly  passenger  cars  and  light commercial vehicles), or on behalf of automotive suppliers.\n\nApplication of this clause is limited to:\n\n- \u25cf a period of twelve (12) months following the date on which Mr.  Luca  de  Meo  effectively  ceases  to  exercise  his  term of office;\n- \u25cf the countries of the European continent and in Japan, as well  as  European  and  Japanese  car  and  equipment manufacturers.\n\nAs consideration for his non-compete obligation, Mr. Luca de Meo  will  receive  from  the  Company,  during  the  period  of application  of  the  agreement  (twelve  months)  and  subject to there being no breach of this agreement, gross financial compensation  corresponding  to  one  year  of  gross  annual compensation  (fixed  compensation  and  annual  variable compensation  paid  in  cash),  payable  in  twelve  monthly instalments.  The  gross  annual  compensation  used  for  this calculation  will  be  the  one  paid  during  the  twelve  months preceding the date of termination of the corporate office.\n\nIn  accordance with  the  recommendation of the AFEP-MEDEF Code at the time of Mr. Luca de Meo's departure, the Board of Directors  of  the  Company  will  decide  whether  to  apply  this non-compete  agreement  and  may  unilaterally  waive  it. Furthermore,  no  compensation  will  be  due  in  the  event  of retirement or if Mr. Luca de Meo has reached the age of 65.\n\n## Top-up pension scheme\n\nDuring  its  meeting  on  February  13,  2020,  the  Board  of Directors authorised a top-up pension scheme for Mr. Luca de Meo.\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors  considered  that  implementing  this scheme  to  the  benefit  of  Mr.  Luca  de  Meo  allows  the Company  to  retain  and  to  promote  the  Chief  Executive Officer's loyalty.\n\nThe  Chief  Executive  Officer's  top-up  pension  scheme  is identical  to  that  available  to  members  of  the  Group Executive  Committee  (the  so-called  'Article  83'  plan  and 'Article 82' plan).\n\n## a) Mandatory defined-contribution pension scheme (Article 83)\n\nThe contributions represent:\n\n- \u25cf 3.5% of the gross annual compensation between four and eight times the social security cap (Band C), paid 2.5% by the Company and 1% by the Chief Executive Officer;\n- \u25cf then 8% of the gross annual compensation between eight and sixteen times the annual French Social Security cap (Band D), paid 5% by the Company and 3% by the Chief Executive Officer.\n\nThe total amount of the contributions (both Company's and CEO's share) is capped at a lump sum equal to 8% of eight times the French Social Security cap.\n\n## b) Optional defined-contribution pension scheme (Article 82)\n\nThe Chief Executive Officer benefits from the new optional defined-contribution pension scheme (Article 82) set up as from May 1 st ,  2020  for  the  benefit  of  the  corporate  officers and members of the Group's Executive Committee.\n\nThis new scheme provides for the payment by the Company to  a  third-party  entity  (an  insurer)  of  contributions  equal  to 12.5% of the gross annual compensation (fixed and variable) actually received.\n\nThe  contributions  paid  in  this  way  do  not  benefit  from  any preferential  tax  and  social  security  regime.  For  this  reason, the Chief Executive Officer will receive a lump-sum indemnity equal to the amount of the contribution paid on his behalf to the insurer. Payment of this indemnity will be concomitant to the payment of the contribution to the insurer.\n\nThe contributions and lump-sum indemnity amounts will be dependent  on  the  Company's  performance  insofar  as  the calculation  basis  includes  the  variable  portion  of  the compensation which is related to the Group's results.",

Any use of this option will be communicated to the shareholders.\n\n## 3.2.4.3 Compensation policy for directors for the 2024 financial year\n\nResolution to be submitted to the Annual General Meeting of May 16, 2024, pursuant to Article L. 22-10-8 II. of the French Commercial Code\n\n## Eighteenth resolution - Approval of the compensation policy for directors for the 2024 financial year\n\nThe  Annual  General  Meeting,  voting  under  the  conditions  of quorum  and  majority  required  for  ordinary  general  meetings, having  reviewed  the  report  on  corporate  governance  referred to in Article L. 225-37 of the French Commercial Code describing the  components  of  the  compensation  policy  for  the  directors and corporate officers set by the Board of Directors, approves, pursuant  to  the  provisions  of  Article  L.22-10-8  II.  of  the  French Commercial Code, the compensation policy for directors for the 2024  financial  year,  as  set  out  in  chapter  3.2.4.3  of  the Company's 2023 Universal registration document.\n\n## Overall budget for directors' compensation\n\nThe  Annual  General  Meeting  of  June  15,  2018,  set  at \u20ac1,500,000  the  maximum  amount  of  compensation  to  be allocated among the directors (seventeenth resolution).\n\n## Allocation policy\n\nThe methods for allocating directors' remuneration adopted by  the  Board  of  Directors  consists  of  setting  a  maximum annual amount of directors' compensation for participation in Board of Directors' meetings and meetings of each of the committees, which will include:\n\n- \u25cf a fixed portion, pro-rated according to the duration of the office over the year; and\n- \u25cf a variable portion, pro-rated according to the attendance rate over the total number of meetings for the year.\n\nThe variable portion related to attendance at the meetings of the Board of Directors and of committees is preponderant compared to the fixed portion.\n\nThe  advantages  of  this  allocation  policy  are  that  it  will prevent  the  annual  maximum  amount  for  directors' compensation  from  being  exceeded,  and  there  will  be  a strong correlation between compensation and attendance.\n\nUpon recommendation of the Governance and Remuneration Committee, the Board of Directors proposes to modify the compensation policy for directors in respect of the 2024 financial year. Thus, the maximum amounts of the fixed  and  variable  portions  for  Board  meetings  will  be increased as follows:\n\n- \u25cf Fixed portion: from \u20ac18,000 to \u20ac20,000;\n- \u25cf Variable portion: from \u20ac35,000 to \u20ac40,000.\n\nThe  amounts  of  the  fixed  and  variable  portions  for Committee meetings remain unchanged.\n\nThese  changes  to  the  remuneration  policy  represent  an increase of up to a maximum of \u20ac7,000 per director. Taking this  increase  into  account,  the  total  sums  allocated  to directors  will  remain  well  below  the  overall  envelope  of \u20ac1,5000,000 decided by shareholders since 2018.\n\nI\n\n03",

Therefore, such salary will not be disclosed.\n\nIn  addition,  directors  are  entitled  to  reimbursement  of expenses incurred by them in the exercise of their office, in particular  any  travel  and  accommodation  expenses  in connection with meetings of the Board of Directors and of committees.\n\n## 3.2.5 Employee share-based compensation\n\n## 3.2.5.1 Allocation policy for the performance share plans\n\n## Legal framework\n\nIn  its  twenty-sixth  resolution,  the  Annual  General  Meeting held  on  May  25,  2022  authorised  the  Board  of  Directors  to proceed, on one or more occasions, with free allocations of existing  Company  shares  and/or  Company  shares  to  be issued  (so-called  performance  shares)  for  the  benefit  of employees and/or corporate officers of the Company and/ or of French or non-French companies or groups directly or indirectly  related  to  it,  or  certain  categories  thereof, pursuant  to  the  terms  of  Article  L.  225-197-2  of  the  French Commercial Code.\n\nPerformance share plans are decided annually by the Board of Directors upon recommendation of the Governance and Compensation  Committee  which  examines  the  allocation proposals for certain Renault Group employees presented by the Chief Executive Officer, pursuant to the general scheme set by the Annual General Meeting.\n\nIn  accordance  with  best  market  practices,  the  vesting  of performance  shares  is  subject  to  (i)  performance  conditions set by the Board of Directors assessed over a minimum period of three years, (ii) a minimum vesting period of three years and (iii) a presence condition.\n\nThe beneficiary of performance shares must be an employee or corporate officer within Renault Group at the vesting date of the shares. In case of departure from Renault Group before the vesting date, the beneficiary loses his/her entitlement to the  performance  shares  granted  to  him/her,  except  in  the case of compulsory or voluntary early retirement.\n\nIn  the  event  of  the  death,  total  or  partial  invalidity,  or extended  sick  leave  of  the  beneficiary,  they  retain  the\n\nbenefit  of  the  performance  shares,  and  the  performance conditions do not apply.\n\nPerformance  share  allocations  granted  pursuant  to  the aforementioned  authorisation  are  subject  to  the  following caps being observed:\n\n- \u25cf the  total  number  of  performance  shares  allocated  may not exceed 3% of the share capital over three years;\n- \u25cf the  total  number  of  performance  shares  allocated  may not exceed 10% of the share capital on the date on which the Board of Directors decides on their allocation;\n- \u25cf the  number  of  performance  shares  allocated  to  senior executive  officers  may  not  exceed  15%  of  the  total number of shares allocated;\n- \u25cf the number of performance shares allocated to members of  the  executive  committee  (also  known  as  Leadership Team) may not exceed 30% of the total number of shares allocated, including performance shares allocated to the Chief Executive Officer.\n\nPursuant  to  the  twenty-sixth  resolution  of  the  Annual General Meeting held on May 25, 2022, performance share allocations do not result in any dilution for the shareholders, as the performance shares allocated are treasury shares.\n\nUnder the terms of the twenty-seventh resolution submitted to  the  vote  of  the  Annual  General  Meeting  of  May  16,  2024, the  shareholders will  be  invited  to  renew  the  authorisation granted  to  the  Board  of  Directors  at  the  Annual  General Meeting  of  May  25,  2022  for  the  purpose  of  allocating performance shares.",

The  allocation  of shares  increases  their  commitment  and  motivation  to implement growth in the Company.\n\n## Share allocation policy\n\nAllocation is differentiated according to beneficiaries' level of  responsibility  and  contribution,  on  the  basis  of  the appraisal of their performance and results, and according to the assessment of their development potential.\n\nBeneficiaries are divided into three categories.\n\n## Top management\n\nAs of March 1 st ,  2024, the top management team consists of 18  members  of  the  Leadership  Team  (Group  executive committee).\n\nThe  portion  of  performance  shares  granted  to  the  Chief Executive  Officer  and  the  members  of  the  Leadership\n\n## 3.2.5.2 Employee shareholding policy\n\nSince 2022, Renault Group has been committed to a strong policy  of  developing  employee  share  ownership  as  part  of the deployment of the Renaulution strategy.\n\nThis  revival  of  employee  share  ownership  within  Renault Group was reinforced by the approval of several resolutions governing  these  operations  by  the  General  Meeting  of  25 May 2022  and  at  the  General  Meeting  of  May  11,  2023.  The Board  of  Directors  of  February  15,  2023  approved  the implementation,  for  the  second  year  in  a  row,  of  an employee  share  ownership  operation  in  2023.  The  Group thus is pursuing its objective of significantly increasing the employee share ownership rate by 2030.\n\nThe  new  employee  ownership  policy  will  also  strengthen collective commitment, thus fuelling the success of the new strategy  and  aligning  the  long-term  interests  of  Renault Group  employees  with  those  of  shareholders,  whilst  also contributing to the stability of Renault shareholding.\n\nThis policy is based on the following strategic orientations:\n\n- \u25cf Regular implementation of collective employee shareholding offers, which could take the form of an offer to  acquire shares under the Group Savings Plan and the\n\nTeam  (including  the  Chief  Executive  Officer)  does  not exceed,  respectively,  15%  and  30%  of  the  performance shares granted.\n\n## Senior managers\n\nSenior  managers  are  beneficiaries  and  the  number  of performance shares allocated vary, according to their level of  responsibility,  performance,  and  results.  Certain  senior executives may not be beneficiaries.\n\n## Other beneficiaries\n\nThe  other  beneficiaries  are  usually  senior  managers  and managers with high professional or managerial development  potential  or  with  a  high  level  of  expertise. There are numerous complementary systems for assessing and  selecting  these  beneficiaries  (level  of  responsibility, annual  appraisal  interview,  career  committees,  specific monitoring  for  high  potential  executives,  etc.);  these systems allow various observations which help us to find the most deserving candidates.\n\nOver the past five  years,  the  total  number  of  performance share beneficiaries was:\n\n- \u25cf 1,322 under the 2019 plan,\n- \u25cf 1,421 under the 2020 plan,\n- \u25cf 2,015 under the 2021 plan,\n- \u25cf 1,663 under the 2022 plan, and\n- \u25cf 1,537 under the 2023 plan.\n\nInternational  Group  Savings  Plan,  with  employees  being able to benefit from a maximum discount of 30% on the stock  price  and  a  matching  contribution,  in  accordance with the provisions of the French Labor Code. In order to give  all  Group  employees  an  opportunity  to  become shareholders,  Renault  could  also  make  a  collective  free allocation of shares.\n\n- \u25cf Long-term variable compensation through annual allocation  of  performance  shares,  as  described  in  chapter 3.2.5.1 of the Company's Universal Registration Document.\n- \u25cf Occasional implementation of specific plans, such as the co-investment plan which was offered in 2022 and 2023 to the Group's key executives, including the Chief Executive Officer and the members of the Leadership Team, based on  each  participant's  voluntary,  personal  investment  in Renault shares at risk, for a minimum period of five years, and  which  may  give  entitlement,  subject  to  compliance with  strict  attendance  and  performance  conditions,  to Renault performance shares.\n\nThe  various  mechanisms  of  this  policy  is  deployed  in  as many  countries  as  possible,  depending  on  regulatory  and technical constraints.\n\nI\n\n03",

Launched  in  September  2023,  Renaulution Shareplan 2023 was deployed in 30 countries and offered to more  than  100,000  employees  (and  eligible  retired  former employees in France).\n\nTo  ensure  that  employees  benefit  from  the  successful implementation  of  the  stages  of  the  the  \"Revolution\" strategic  plan,  the  Group  also  decided  to  increase  by  30% compared to the 2022 plan the contributions offered under the  2023  plan.  This  significant  increase  allowed  eligible employees  to  receive  up  to  16  free  shares,  compared  to 12 shares awarded free of charge under the 2022 plan.\n\nAs in the previous edition, the offer reserved for employees was carried out within the framework of Articles L. 3332-18 et seq. of the French Labour Code, as well as the savings plans of  Renault Group, DIAC and RRG. In some countries, due to local  legal,  tax  and  operational  constraints,  the  offer  was implemented outside this legal framework.\n\nThis  2023  operation  offered  each  eligible  employee  of  the Group:\n\n- \u25cf a free allocation of 8 Renault shares (offer in 30 countries), and\n- \u25cf the possibility of purchasing Renault shares on preferential terms (offer in 23 countries).\n\nUnder  the  subscription  offer,  eligible  employees  were offered  the  opportunity  to  subscribe  shares  at  a  30% discount to the average of the 20 stock prices preceding the date  on  which  the  subscription  price  was  set  by  the  Chief Executive  Officer.  The  subscription  price  was  EUR  26.28.  In addition  to  this  30%  discount,  Renault  Group  added  an additional  contribution  capped  at  8  free  shares  (matching contribution of 300% on the first two shares purchased, i.e. 6  free  shares,  and  200%  on  the  third  share  purchased,  i.e. 2 additional free shares).\n\nThe  subscription  period  ran  from  September  18  to  October  2, 2023,  inclusive.  Delivery  of  the  shares  subscribed  for  under  the operation  took  place  on  November  22,  2023.  The  shares  so acquired must be held until June 30, 2028 (except in exceptional cases of  early  exit)  through  a  corporate  mutual  fund  (FCPE)  or directly in a registered account in some countries.\n\nAs  in  2022,  Renaulution  Shareplan  2023  was  a  great  success with Group employees: more than 95,000 employees benefited\n\n## 3.2.5.3 Summary tables\n\nPlans  nos.  27  to  nos.  30  are  performance  share  allocation plans  in  which  some  of  the  shares  were  allocated  to  the Chief  Executive  Officer  and  subject  to  an  additional performance criterion compared to the shares allocated to other beneficiaries.\n\nfrom  the  free  allocation  of  8  shares  and  nearly  38,000 employees  subscribed  for  purchasing  additional  shares, representing a subscription rate of 36% at Group level.\n\nThe contributions offered by Renault Group in the context of the operation (unilateral contribution equivalent to 8 shares and  additional  matching  contribution  capped  at  8  shares) amounted to approximately 861,500 shares, i.e. approximately 0.29% of Renault S.A. share capital.\n\nThe total investment by employees was more than \u20ac33,379,000, for an average subscription amount  per employee of \u20ac881. This represents more than 1,270,100 shares, i.e. approximately 0.29% of Renault S.A. share capital.\n\nThe  2023  operation  resulted  in  the  transfer  to  Group employees  of  approximately  2,131,700  additional  shares, representing 0.72% of Renault S.A.'s share capital.\n\nThe success of the Renaulution Shareplan 2023 demonstrates  once  again  the  strong  commitment  of  the Group's  employees  and  their  confidence  in  the  strategic direction taken over the last three years.\n\nIt is a further important step in the Group's ambition to reach 10% employee share ownership by 2030.\n\n## 2023 co-investment operation\n\nThe  Group  also  renewed  in  2023  the  co-investment  plan proposed to the members of the Leadership Team (including the  Chief  Executive  Officer)  and  to  approximately  460  key executives of Renault Group.\n\nThe operation was based on a voluntary, personal and risky investment  in  Renault  shares  by  each  participant  for  a minimum  period  of  five  years  and  gave  the  right  to  a matching  contribution  in  the  form  of  a  free  allocation  of Renault performance shares.\n\nVesting  of  the  performance  shares  acquired  under  this operation will take place after a three-year and two-month vesting  period  and  subject  to  fulfillment  of  strict  presence and performance conditions. Once vested, the shares will be subject to a holding period of one year and ten months.\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors  of  December  14,  2023  awarded 78,495  performance  shares  to  165  participants  of  the  coinvestment plan (excluding the Chief Executive Officer).\n\nThe  success  of  this  co-investment  operation  shows  the strong commitment of Renault Group's key executives who, through  their  voluntary  investment  from  their  own  funds, reiterate  their  trust  in  the  Group's  strategy  and  their commitment to achieving the Group's growth objectives.\n\nThe size  of  the  plans  outstanding  as  of  December  31,  2023 corresponds to 1.76% of the Company's share capital.",

The  risk  management  and internal control processes are implemented in all corporate Functions and activities. The main objectives are:\n\n- \u25cf Identify  and  manage  risks  to  which  the  company  is exposed;\n- \u25cf Ensure compliance with rules, laws and regulations;\n- \u25cf Control quality, cost and delivery times in its activities;\n- \u25cf Ensure  that  financial,  accounting  and  management disclosures are reliable, relevant and of a high standard.\n\nThese structures and procedures cannot, however, offer an absolute  guarantee  that  the  company's  objectives  will  be achieved.  In  order  to  mediate  between  the  opportunities and risks, Renault Group's global risk management system aims to reduce the impact and/or probability of events with potential  significant  influence  on  the  control  of  operations or  the  fulfilment of objectives. The internal control and risk management  systems  identify  and  assess  risks  by measuring the level of risk factor control and the efficacy of management plans.\n\nThe Group comprises the following operating segments:\n\n- \u25cf Renault Group's Automotive Division;\n- \u25cf Mobility Services, which include activities related to new mobility (mainly the Renault M.A.I. holding company and its subsidiaries);\n- \u25cf Sales  financing,  operated  by  RCI  Banque  S.A.  and  its subsidiaries,  under  the  trade  name  Mobilize  Financial Services.\n\nRenault  Group  relies  on  the  reference  framework  and implementation guidelines of the French Financial Markets Authority  (AMF)  and  the  recommendations  of  the  Audit Committee  working  group  report  published  in  July  2010. This  framework  applies  to  the  Automotive  and  Mobility Services segments.\n\nMobilize Financial Services (Mobilize FS) has defined its own internal control and risk management framework (detailed in  chapter  4.1.6)  in  accordance  with  banking  and  financial regulations.  Mobilize  FS  is  subject  to  supervision  by  the French  Prudential  Supervisory  Authority  (ACPR)  and  the European Central Bank (ECB).\n\n## 4.1.1 Contributors to risk management\n\nRenault  Group's  Automotive  segment  is  structured  around two areas:\n\n- \u25cf 'Business  Units'  for  each  brand  are  responsible  for margins  and  customer  satisfaction.  They  drive  the organisation towards targeted customers and markets;\n- \u25cf 'Corporate  Functions'  include  all  other  business  lines  of the  company.  They  define  the  policies  and  provide standards, methods and skills appropriate to the activities.\n\nSince 1 November 2023, the Ampere subsidiary, which brings together  the  electric  vehicle  and  software  activities,  has operated independently. As such, Ampere has set up its own corporate functions and risk control system, while drawing on the Group's expertise and tools.",

Operational management is responsible for identifying the risks  associated  with  each  activity  and  implementing actions to reduce their impact.\n\nEmployees  are  therefore  required  to  comply  with  the internal control system defined for their field of activity, the Group's code of ethics, the anticorruption code of conduct, as  well  as  their  own  dedicated  codes  of  ethics.  Among  its other responsibilities, operational management defines and monitors  the  implementation  of  action  plans  after  the Internal Audit Department has performed its duties.\n\n## Second line of control: Risk Management, Internal Control, Ethics and Compliance Department, and Performance and Control Department\n\nBeyond  their  role  as  the  first  line  of  control  via  their employees  and  managers,  the  'Corporate'  functions  also contribute  as  a  second  line  of  control  since  they  are responsible  for  establishing  and  circulating  standards, guidelines and  Group  policies;  regulatory  monitoring; forming and coordinating an internal and external network of correspondents; ensuring that their policies and standards  are  properly  understood  and  applied;  and\n\nperforming controls,  when  necessary,  within  the  operating entities to confirm that they are being implemented.\n\n## They are supported in this process by:\n\n- \u25cf The  Internal  Control  Department  (DCI),  which  provides reasonable assurance on the level of internal control by assessing  its  maturity  and  effectiveness.  For  this purpose,  it  circulates  self-assessment  questionnaires and  carries  out  compliance  tests.  It  also  ensures  that action plans are identified and implemented to correct the shortcomings identified;\n- \u25cf The Risk Management Department (DMR), which updates the  mapping  of  the  Group's  major  risks,  monitors  the associated action plans intended to reduce the impact or probability  of  the  main  risks  identified  and  provides support  to  the  operating  entities,  Corporate  Functions and projects to map their risks;\n- \u25cf The Ethics and Compliance Division (DEC), which manages the  anticorruption  compliance  system  and  ensures  that the regulatory compliance systems are robust;\n- \u25cf The  Group  Performance  and  Control  Department (DPCG),  with  its  representatives  in  the  entities,  which coordinates  and  steers  the  process  in  the  field.  It ensures  that  all  personnel  comply  with  management rules  and  assists  operational  staff  in  the  coordination and monitoring of their action plans.\n\n## Third line of control: Internal Audit Department\n\nThe Internal Audit Department (DAI) conducts an independent  and  objective  assessment  of  the  corporate governance,  risk  management  and  control  processes  as defined within the Group. The mission, role,  responsibilities and scope of the Internal Audit Department are defined in an  audit  charter,  the  updated  version  of  which  was approved  by  the  Audit  and  Risk  Committee  (CAR)  in February 2023.\n\nThrough its recommendations, the DAI helps to improve the safety  of  operations  and  optimise  the  company's  overall performance.  At  the  end  of  each  assignment,  the  DAI distributes  a  report  and  a  summary  note,  which  are systematically distributed to the areas audited, the functions,  entities  and/or  projects  in  question,  the  Chief Executive  Officer  and  the  Chairman  of  the  Group.  The summary note includes an opinion issued by Internal Audit that  aims  to  give  an  overall  assessment  of  the  level  of control  of  the  audited  activities:  controlled,  moderate, significant or major risk.\n\nThe DAI covers all entities and activities of Renault Group's Automotive branch and Mobility Services.\n\nThe  financial  branch  (Mobilize  Financial  Services)  has  its own internal audit structure (see chapter 4.1.6.). For entities in partnership with Renault Group, Internal Audit may intervene  if  the  partner  agrees  and  according  to  the partnership  contract.  For  activities  entrusted  to  third parties,  intervention  by  Internal  Audit  is  possible  if  the contract's audit clause so provides.\n\nThe  audit  plan  is  made  on  an  annual  basis  and  covers  a rolling three-year period. It is verified by Senior Management\n\nI\n\n04",

This audit plan is revised as often as necessary to take into account additional requests or necessary adjustments.\n\nInternal Audit assignments make it possible to:\n\n- \u25cf Assess the compliance of processes and their application with the rules, standards, laws and regulations in force;\n- \u25cf Assess the effectiveness of processes and the performance of transactions;\n- \u25cf Verify  the  quality  of  the  controls  performed  by  the operational departments,  the support and  control functions;\n- \u25cf Suggest areas for improvement or progress in the form of recommendations;\n- \u25cf Fight against fraud and corruption;\n- \u25cf Verify the effective implementation of the recommendations.\n\nFollowing the recommendations made in each audit report, an action plan defined by the audited entities is approved by the internal audit function. Recommendations have three levels of criticality  (high,  medium  and  low).  The  DAI  ensures  that  the recommendations  are  implemented.  At  least  every  six months, it prepares a progress report on recommendations\n\nof high and medium criticality for the Leadership Team and the CAR.\n\nThe  DAI  is  certified  by  the  IFACI 1 . This  certification,  in accordance  with  the  standards  for  the  professional practice  of  internal  auditing (r\u00e9f\u00e9rentiel  professionnel  de l'audit  interne -  RAI),  comprises  25  general  requirements divided into 100 detailed requirements across five categories:  positioning,  steering,  GRC  (governance,  risks and compliance) assessment programme, professionalism and audit processes.\n\n## Synchronisation of activities\n\nThe  DDCI,  DEC  and  DAI  work  closely  together  on  a  regular basis  to  ensure  a  shared  vision  of  the  Group's  priority  risks and  issues,  to  define  a  consistent  approach  and  to  ensure effective  monitoring  between  the  second  and  third  lines  of control. They synchronise their activities and ensure that their combined actions provide reasonable control of risks.\n\nThis cooperation will be facilitated and strengthened by the use of a tool common to Risk Management, Internal Control and Internal Audit. This tool is currently being developed and will be implemented in 2024.\n\n## 4.1.2 Governance of risk management\n\nThe first two lines of control report on risk management and internal control to the Risk and Internal Control Committee (CRCI), which is also responsible for validating and regularly assessing the effectiveness of the internal control and risk management systems.\n\nThis  Committee,  chaired  by  the  Group  Chief  Financial Officer  and  co-chaired  by  the  Director  of  Audit  and  Risks, consists  of  around  twenty  members  representing  the company's various Corporate Functions. It meets six times a year and examines, in particular, the mapping of the Group's major risks and their plan for addressing them, the results of the  annual  internal  control  self-assessments  and  the monitoring of associated action plans, as well as proposals to improve the systems. The CRCI may decide on corrective actions or request additional information.\n\nThe  first  two  lines  of  control  also  report  to  the  Leadership Team on an ad hoc basis through thematic presentations.\n\nThe second and third lines of control present the results of their  work  to  the  Audit  and  Risk  Committee  (CAR),  whose duties are defined in chapter 3.1.6.1.\n\nIn  the  course  of  their  duties,  the  Statutory  Auditors  assess the level of risk management and internal control applicable to  the  preparation  and  processing  of  accounting  and financial  data  as  part  of  their  work  and,  when  necessary, issue recommendations.\n\nIn the  operating  entities,  functions  and  projects,  the Management Committee  ensures  the  effectiveness  of  the risk control and management systems and their progress.",

The major  risk  factors  to  which  the  Group  is  exposed  are described in chapter 4.2.\n\nTo  carry  out  its  duties,  the  Risk  Management  Department (DMR) relies on, in particular, two networks:\n\n- \u25cf The  network  of  operational  risk  managers  (RMO)  within the  operating  entities  (countries,  commercial  and/or industrial  subsidiaries),  Corporate  Functions  and  the quality  function  for  vehicle  projects.

They consult on the standardised risk management plans in their area of expertise.\n\n## 4.1.4 Internal control\n\nThe  internal  control  system  is  based  on  the  various guidelines and tools detailed below.\n\n## Ethical guidelines and Corporate Functions of the Group\n\nThe  company's  'Corporate  Functions'  define  the  policies and standards to be deployed, which are then rolled out as procedures and operating methods  to ensure that processes  at  the  operational  level  function  in  accordance with  the  principles  outlined  in  the  Ethics  Charter,  Code  of Conduct  on  Corruption  and  Influence  Peddling  and  the dedicated Codes of Ethics.\n\nTo  draw  up  the  audit  plan,  the  Internal  Audit  Department (DAI) relies in particular on risk mapping to identify the most relevant  audit  topics  and  assess  risk  coverage.  Following the auditing tasks, the DAI provides the DMR with insight on the effective level of control of risks.\n\nIn 2023, the DMR focused its activities on:\n\n- \u25cf Consolidating treatment plans and processes to improve the control of the major risks;\n- \u25cf Reinforcing  the  governance  of  major  risks  through regular sharing with the Leadership Team and the CAR;\n- \u25cf Updating  the  mapping  of  the  Group's  major  risks.  This exercise was done in cooperation with the risk managers, based on the progress of the action plans, the new risks identified  and  the  analysis  of  the  mapping  of  entities, Corporate  Functions  and  vehicle  projects  carried  out  in late 2022 and in 2023;\n- \u25cf Assisting the operating entities, Corporate Functions and new vehicle projects for the implementation of risk maps produced with the operational risk managers concerned and for the monitoring of treatment plans;\n- \u25cf Leading  the  network  of  operational  risk  managers  and experts and the representatives of the performance and control,  internal  control  and  internal  audit  functions  in sharing best practices.\n\nIn addition, awareness-raising actions for Group employees about risk culture and the fundamentals of risk management  were  continued  by  the  DMR,  particular through e-learning modules.\n\nThe  Internal  Control  Department  (DCI)  manages  internal control issues within the business lines through a methodology that aims to, in particular:\n\n- \u25cf Work  with  the  business  lines  to  identify  the  main  risks relating to operational  processes  and  a  potential significant impact on the achievement of objectives;\n- \u25cf Formalise the key metrics to be applied in the activities;\n- \u25cf Identify and  formalise  the  key  controls  aimed  at controlling the identified risks.\n\nI\n\nRisk and control\n\n04",

It provides an overview of the internal control system and is an entry point to the various business sites.\n\nThese internal control guidelines are updated every year to take  into  account  the  evolution  of  identified  risks  and organisational changes. Recommendations made following internal  audits  or  by  the  statutory  auditors  are  taken  into account during this update.\n\nThe DCI relies on a network of internal control correspondents  who  are  affiliated  with  the  Performance and  Control  function  of  the  subsidiaries  and  Corporate Functions  and  are  the  key  contacts  for  internal  control issues. They lead and ensure the implementation of internal control objectives within their scope.\n\n## Control activity\n\nOnce a year, the DCI Department sends an internal control selfassessment campaign (in the form of a questionnaire) based on these risk control factors to the Group's main entities. The CEOs  of  the  entities  validate  these  self-assessments  and commit to defining and implementing action plans to remedy any  internal  control  shortcomings  identified.  These  action plans are regularly monitored by the DCI.\n\nThe results of these self-assessments are presented to the Risk  and  Internal  Control  Committee  (CRCI)  and  the  Audit and Risk Committee (CAR) once a year.\n\nCompliance  tests  are  conducted  based  on  a  sample  of entities  by  the  internal  controllers  of  the  DCI  to  verify  the quality  of  the  self-assessments.  Any  significant  deviation from  the  expectations  of  the  guidelines  gives  rise  to  an action  plan.  This  internal  control  system  applies  to  all controlled entities of the Group.\n\nEntities with lower risk levels (entities not fully consolidated or unconsolidated entities) are subject to separate internal control systems.\n\nNewly  acquired  companies  are  consolidated  according  to their potential risk impact in the various systems during the\n\nfirst campaign following their integration. In the first year of self-assessment,  the  results  are  not  consolidated  with  the Group results, as the focus is on the action plans.\n\nThe DCI's work in 2023 focused in particular on:\n\n- \u25cf Continued  action  to  improve  the  corruption  prevention system and support for the operational staff concerned;\n- \u25cf Updating of 'risk control factors' taken into account for the 2023 self-assessment campaign;\n- \u25cf Deployment  of  training:  Seven  e-learning  modules  in addition to training;\n- \u25cf Organisation of quarterly webinars dedicated to coordinating the network of internal controllers;\n- \u25cf Continuation of preventive and detection controls based on a Data Analytics approach.\n\nThe  'tone  at  the  top'  in  terms  of  internal  control  was reaffirmed  by  the  circulation  of  an  editorial  signed  by Renault Group's Chief Financial Officer in the introduction to the  annual  self-assessment  questionnaire,  as  well  as  upon the release of the internal control e-book, the distribution of which  was  supported  by  the  editorials  written  by  Renault Group's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer.\n\nThese  internal  control  communication  and  coordination activities  will  be  continued  in  2024,  including  in  the  new companies.\n\n## Internal delegations and separation of offices\n\nIn addition to command-line structures, the Group has set up a  staff  reporting  system  so  that  Corporate  Functions managers  can  provide  leadership  for  their  function correspondents throughout the Group.\n\nThe  decision-making  process  is  based  on  a  system  of internal  delegation  that  determines  in  which  areas  and  at which levels operational managers may make decisions. All the  rules  for  delegating  decision-making  authority  are communicated  to  personnel  via  the  intranet.  Decision requests  are  tracked  in  a  workflow  that  applies  the  rules specifying  the  persons  to  be  involved,  in  accordance  with internal control procedures or documented in the minutes of the committees responsible for making the decision.\n\nThe principle of segregation of duties and tasks is required at all hierarchical and functional levels within the Group and within  the  computer  systems  to  facilitate  independent control and separate tasks and functions corresponding to operations, the protection of property and their booking for accounting purposes.",

The Performance and Control function is responsible for managing and measuring economic performance at the various levels of the organisation (Group, operating segments, brands and functions). Under the Group's management structure, its role is to:\n\n- \u25cf Set out the group's economic objectives and budget;\n- \u25cf Participate in the implementation of the internal control system and Renault Group's risk management approach;\n- \u25cf Coordinate the Group by measuring the performance of entities,  operating  segments,  brands  and  functions  and, in  particular, by monitoring metrics relating to operating margin for all operating segments and free cash flow for the Automotive operating segments;\n- \u25cf Analyse proposed management decisions at any level from an  economic  perspective,  check  their  consistency  with standards, plans and budgets, judge their economic relevance and give an opinion and recommendation on them.\n\nWithin  the  Global  Finance  Reporting  and  Controls  Division (GFRC),  the  Finance  Delivery  function  is  responsible  for producing the Group's consolidated financial statements, and the Finance Integrity function is responsible for structuring the controls  to  ensure  compliance  with  laws  and  regulations. Responsibility  for  preparing  the  financial  statements  of  the subsidiaries  lies  with  their  Chief  Financial  Officers  and Accounting  Directors, who  report  hierarchically to the Chairmen  and  Chief  Executive  Officers  of  these  subsidiaries and functionally to the Head of the Integrity function.\n\nThe Group has integrated information systems that enable the simultaneous  production  of  financial  statements according to local guidelines and IFRS. This mechanism thus guarantees  the  consistency  of  data  in  a  context  of centralisation  and  consolidation  of  information  within  a short time frame.\n\nFor the preparation of accounting and financial information, the  Group  relies  on  FIRST  (Financial  Internal  Reporting STandards),  an  internal  accounting  manual  drawn  up  in accordance  with  IFRS  indicating  the  Group's  fundamental principles. These standards are continuously updated by the Accounting Standards Department.\n\nThe  consolidated  financial  statements  are  produced monthly and published on a semiannual and annual basis. Pre-close statements are produced twice a year: May 31 for the  June  close  and  October  31  for  the  December  close.\n\nSummary  meetings  are  organised  with  the  statutory auditors  and  attended  by  senior  members  of  the  Finance Division  and  the  Chief  Financial  Officer  as  part  of  ongoing discussions. The CARE is involved at every key stage of the approval process for financial and accounting disclosures. Consolidated turnover is published quarterly.\n\nWithin  the  Global  Finance  Reporting  and  Controls  Division (GFRC),  the  Internal  Control  function  contributes  to  the quality  of  financial  information  and  performs  its  duties based on the AMF reference framework. It covers not only the  processes  involved  in  preparing  financial  information for  closing  the  accounts,  forecasting  phases  or  financial communication but also the upstream operational processes involved in producing this information.\n\n## Key components of the process for controlling financial and accounting disclosures\n\nRenault  Group  manages  the  decentralised  operations  of  the subsidiaries  in  its  three  operating  segments  in  France  or abroad  by  relying  on  the  following  key  strategies  to  deliver high-quality accounting  and  financial  information  while reducing the time needed to prepare the financial statements:\n\n- \u25cf Standardisation  of  operational  systems  upstream  of accounting is systematically sought;\n- \u25cf Deployment of the financial and accounting modules of the  ERP  chosen  by  the  Group  in  the  industrial  and/or commercial,  engineering  and  sales  financing  entities throughout the world.\n\nThis software package ensures the reliability and consistency of processed data. In particular,  the  definition and monitoring of user profiles helps to ensure that the rules of task separation are respected.\n\nControl  of  basic  transactions  handled  by  operational systems,  where  the  initial  control  takes  place,  is  key  to ensuring that accounting and financial data are reliable. The operational  systems  feed  data  to  the  auxiliary  accounting systems  through  interfaces.  These  interfaces,  which  are continually  monitored  to  ensure  they  capture  all  economic events for each upstream process, then rapidly and regularly send these data to the centralised accounting system.\n\nThe accounting teams have worked with IT staff to develop a security process to protect the ERP in the event of a major malfunction. A business continuity plan has been prepared at  corporate  level.  It  is  deployed  in  those  subsidiaries  that use the ERP.\n\nI\n\nRisk and control\n\n04",

This  charter  governs  the relationship  between  Renault  Group  (the  parent  company and  the  French  and  foreign  subsidiaries)  and  its  statutory auditors.

The Mobilize FS Group's Internal Control Committee  has  validated  the  general  framework  for  this system, which is described in the Internal Control Charter.\n\nThis  charter  defines  the  system  applicable  to  the  French and foreign companies over which Mobilize FS has effective control and specifies in particular:\n\n- \u25cf The general arrangements for managing internal control;\n- \u25cf The  local  arrangements  for  subsidiaries,  branches  and joint ventures;\n- \u25cf The special arrangements for various functional areas.\n\nRisk  control  at  Mobilize  FS  is  overseen  on  three  levels  by separate functions:\n\nThe  first  line  of  defence is  exercised  by  the  operational functions in charge of day-to-day risk management as part of  the  activities  in  their  area  of  expertise.  These  functions decide and are responsible for taking risks in the conducting of  transactions  and  the  objectives  assigned  to  them.  They exercise this responsibility in accordance with the management  rules  and  the  risk  limits  defined  by  the Corporate Functional Departments.\n\nThe Corporate Functional Departments are responsible for the  definition  of  rules,  the  management  methods  and measuring and monitoring risks at the company level. Each Department, in its area of expertise, manages and oversees the  risk  management  system  through  guidelines  and objectives for each country. Risks are monitored in periodic dedicated committee meetings both in the subsidiaries and centrally.  These  Departments rely on local representatives for risk measurement and exposure monitoring and ensure that limits are respected at the Group level.\n\nThe second line of defence includes:\n\n- \u25cf The Internal Control Department of the Risk Management Division and the internal controllers for the Group entities, which control the level of compliance of transactions with the management rules defined in the procedures. More specifically, they verify the relevance of the first line of defence;\n- \u25cf The Risk and Banking Regulations Department of the Risk Management  Division,  which  oversees  the  deployment of the  Group's  risk  governance  policy,  verifies  the efficiency of risk management  by  the  Functional Departments and compliance with the established limits and alert thresholds and ensures that the Risk Committee of  the  Mobilize  FS  Board  of  Directors  is  notified  when those thresholds are exceeded;\n- \u25cf The  Compliance  Department,  which  coordinates  the compliance measures and ensures that they are properly implemented throughout Mobilize FS.\n\nThe third line of defence is the internal audit function, which aims  to  provide  assurance  to  the  Mobilize  FS  Board  of Directors  and  Senior  Management  about  the  degree  of control over transactions and the oversight exercised by the first two lines.\n\nThe risk management system covers all the macroprocesses of Mobilize FS and includes the following tools:\n\n- \u25cf A  list  of  the  main  critical  and  significant  risks  for  which  a pilot, appetite level, alert thresholds and limits are defined (Risk  Appetite  Framework).  For  each  risk,  a  detailed analysis is performed that identifies the components of the risk  and  the  management  and  oversight  principles  that keep it  in  line  with  the  risk  appetite  level.  These  elements are  reviewed  at  least  once  a  year  in  connection  with  the Mobilize FS Group's business model and strategy;",

This mapping  is  updated  regularly  by  the  central  Functional Departments. The level of control of operational management  rules is assessed annually by the designated process owners, who are responsible for risk management in their respective areas of competence in line  with Group standards, for defining and updating the corresponding procedures and first-level controls;\n- \u25cf A  regulatory  monitoring  system  run  by  the  Risk  and Banking Regulations Department of the Risk Management  Division,  in  liaison  with  officers  in  the Corporate Divisions, with a view to monitoring, analysing and  informing  operational  staff  of  any  regulatory changes affecting Mobilize FS;\n- \u25cf The incident collection database helps to identify malfunctions  that  correspond  to  predefined  criteria  and enables the corrective and preventive measures required to control  risks  to  be  put  in  place.  This  database  is  used  for internal and regulatory reporting purposes. The system sets thresholds for immediately communicating incidents to the Mobilize F.S. Executive Committee, the Mobilize FS Board of Directors, the Renault  Group  Ethics  and  Compliance Committee  (CEC), the French Prudential Supervisory Authority (ACPR) and the European Central Bank.\n\n## Bodies and actors involved in internal control and risk management within Mobilize FS\n\nThe Board of Directors of Mobilize FS, as supervisory body, has the following responsibilities:\n\n- \u25cf It  decides  on  the  bank's  business  strategy  and monitors the  implementation,  by  Executive  Directors  and  the Executive  Committee,  of  supervisory  procedures  to ensure effective and prudent management;\n- \u25cf It  approves and periodically reviews the strategies and policies for taking  on,  managing,  monitoring  and reducing risk;\n- \u25cf It examines the governance model, periodically assesses its  effectiveness,  and  ensures  that  corrective  action  is taken to remedy any shortcomings;\n- \u25cf It  oversees  the  publication  and  communication  processes and checks the quality and reliability of information due to be published and disclosed by the company.\n\nWithin this framework, it devotes at least one annual meeting to  reviewing  the  internal  control  system  and  validates  the annual report on internal control sent to the ACPR.\n\nIn  carrying  out  its  tasks,  the  Board  of  Directors  relies  in particular  on  the  work  of  four  specialised  Committees  of this Board:\n\n- \u25cf The  Audit  and  Accounts  Committee  meets  four  times  a year.  It  is  responsible  for  preparing,  presenting  and monitoring  the  financial  statements,  overseeing  the statutory audit of the separate  and  consolidated financial statements, monitoring the independence of the statutory auditors and the definition of their non-auditing services, recommending the appointment of the\n\nstatutory auditors and monitoring their rotation, verifying the effectiveness of internal control and risk management systems, reviewing the audit plan, analysing the audits carried out and reviewing investments in unconsolidated companies;\n\n- \u25cf The Risk Committee meets at least four times a year. Its tasks  include  examining  the  risk  maps  and  validating their definition, analysing and validating risk limits at the Mobilize  FS  level  in  line  with  the  Board's  risk  appetite.  It assists the Board in terms of control. It is also responsible for analysing action plans in the event that limits or alert thresholds  are  exceeded  and  for  examining  the  pricing systems  for  products  and  services.  In  parallel  with  the Compensation  Committee,  it  also  has  the  task  of examining whether the compensation policy is compatible with the company's risk exposure. With a view to advising the Board of Directors, this committee is also responsible for the analysis and approval of the internal control  report,  compliance  with  capital  (ICAAP)  and liquidity  (ILAAP)  regulations.  The  recovery  plan  and significant aspects of the rating and estimating processes derived from the company's internal credit risk models are also concerned;\n- \u25cf The  Compensation  Committee  meets  at  least  twice  a year.  It  examines  the  compensation  policy  for  company officers and the Head of Risk Management annually and prepares  decisions  for  the  Board  of  Directors  regarding the compensation of individuals who have an impact on risk and risk management;\n- \u25cf The  Appointments  Committee  meets  at  least  twice  a year.  One  of  its  tasks  is  to  recommend  directors  to  the Board of Directors. It is also in charge of the annual review of the Board  of  Directors, including its structure, membership,  gender  diversity  and  breadth  of  directors' knowledge, skills and experience. It submits nominations to  the  Board for Executive Directors, the Chief Executive Officer,  Deputy  Chief  Executive  Officers  and  the  holders of key positions.\n\nThe Executive Committee, the Group's Senior Management body, directs the Mobilize FS policy and strategy.\n\nSenior  Management relies on the following Committees to oversee the Group's risk management:\n\n- \u25cf The  Financial  Committee,  which  reviews  the  following topics:  economic  analysis  and  forecasts,  cost  of  funds, liquidity  risks,  interest  rate  risk  and  counterparty  risk  in the  different  areas  and  subsidiaries  of  the  Group.  The balance sheet and income statement of the Mobilize FS holding  company  are  also  analysed  to  make  the necessary adjustments to intra-Group transfer pricing;\n- \u25cf The Capital and Liquidity Committee steers the evolution of  capital  and  refinancing  needs  according  to  business activity forecasts;\n- \u25cf The  Credit  Committee,  which  approves  commitments exceeding the authorisation limits of subsidiaries and the Group Head of Commitments;\n- \u25cf The  Credit  Risk  Committee,  which  validates  the  action plans in the event that the cost of risk levels validated for each country as part of the budget process are exceeded;\n\nI\n\n04",

The DRRB  ensures  the  reliability  of  risk  measurement  metrics, the completeness of risk management systems for each risk and  the  effective  exercise  of  such  management.  More specifically,  the  DRRB  verifies  the  effectiveness  of  the reporting and alert feedback channels from the subsidiaries to  the  Corporate  Departments  and  prepares  a  summary report on the risks for the management bodies and the Risk Committee of the Board of Directors. Where appropriate, the DRRB  verifies  the  adequacy  of  the  corrective  measures developed  in  the  event  of  failures  and  their  effective implementation  by  the  management  functions.  It  plays  a central  role  in  monitoring  the  Group's  compliance  with applicable prudential regulations.\n\nThe  Audit  and  Periodic  Control  Director  for  the  Mobilize  FS Group  reports  to  the  Chief  Executive  Officer.  Independent  of the  Permanent  Control  Department,  this  Director  works  with the  various  subsidiaries  based  on  a  multiyear  audit  plan validated by the Audit and Accounts Committee. Audits result in written reports including recommendations  that  are submitted to the Internal Control Committee and the Audit and Accounts Committee. The findings and recommendations are presented in the annual report on internal control.",

'Extra-Financial Performance  Declaration'  have  been  included  in  this analysis. Depending on their materiality, they contributed to the  description  of  certain  risk  factors.  This  is  the  case,  for example,  with  risks related to global warming,  the protection of personal data or supplier relations.\n\nHowever,  it  cannot  be  ruled  out  that  other  risk  factors currently  considered  insignificant  or  not  identified  could adversely affect Renault Group in the future. Also, possible changes  in  the  Group's  medium-term  strategic  plan  could result in changes in the nature or relative importance of risk factors.  It  should  be  noted  that  the  major  risk  mapping  is updated  every  year,  in  close  collaboration  with  the preparatory work and implementation of the strategic plan, so  that  the  plan  integrates  the  appropriate  action  plans designed  to  respond  to  the  operational  or  strategic  risks identified.\n\nThe major risk factors are summarised in the table below by risk  category  and  decreasing  order  of  criticality.

As  part  of  its  'Renaulution' strategic  plan,  Renault  Group  has  made  a  commitment  to\n\nachieve carbon neutrality in Europe by 2040 and worldwide by 2050.\n\nIn this context, the risks for the Group are that it will not be able  to  comply  with  external  constraints  or  fulfil  its  own commitments  in  terms  of  decarbonisation  or  that  the responses provided, particularly with regard to the introduction  of  electric  and  hybrid  technologies,  with varying performance in terms of customer service costs and CO2  emissions,  will  prove  to  be  imperfectly  adapted  to market  expectations  or  will  result  in  additional  costs incompatible with profitability requirements. This risk is also assessed  in  terms  of  reputation:  a  mismatch  between  the Group's  offering  and  its  climate  commitments  and  the expectations  of  its  stakeholders  could  damage  its  brand image, reducing its appeal to customers, suppliers, employees and investors.",

This strategy is based on nine priority actions, covering both the vehicle use phase (with a major impact on the Group's product plan) and the supply and manufacturing phases.\n\nIt  is  accompanied  by  strengthened  governance  as  part  of the  Group's  overall  Sustainable  Development  governance (see chapter 2.1.2). This involves all the divisions concerned at the highest level and is supported by the implementation of proven tools and processes to steer the reduction of the carbon  footprint  over  the  entire  vehicle  life  cycle  (such  as the 'CAFE Control Tower') and reports monthly on its results to the Leadership Team.\n\nRenault Group has also set up internal carbon pricing (ICP) to manage  the  reduction  of  its  CO2  emissions  by  internalising the  economic  cost  of  greenhouse  gas  emissions  in  vehicle projects,  industrial  facilities  and  procurement  of  parts  and raw materials (see chapter 2.2.2.1.2.3).\n\n## Physical risks\n\nThese  are  the  consequences  of  climate  change  on  the Group's activities.\n\nExtreme weather events (hurricanes, floods, droughts, fires), the  frequency  and  intensity  of  which  are  increasing,  in connection  with  global  warming,  may  impact  the  Group's industrial  and  logistics  activities,  leading  to  an  increase  in prevention  and  maintenance  costs  and  an  increase  in insurance  premiums.  Similarly,  the  increasing  scarcity  of some  natural  resources,  such  as  water,  may  impact production conditions in certain countries.\n\n## Risk management\n\nPhysical  risks  related  to  climate  change  are  monitored  in the  overall  governance  on  sustainable  development,  the environment and the climate described in chapter 2.1.2.\n\nThey are aggravating factors for existing risks, in particular the risks of natural disasters and industrial accidents at our sites  and  supply  chains.  The  analysis  and  monitoring  of these  risks  gradually  factor  in  the  potential  impacts  of climate  change.  These  risks  are  analysed  especially  in  the context of investment requests and the building maintenance. Climate change could also lead to geopolitical risks.\n\nA comprehensive vulnerability study of our industrial sites with regard to extreme climate scenarios was carried out in 2022. This  study  highlighted  the  risks  weighing  on  Renault  Group sites along three lines: extreme heat, water stress and the risk of flooding. In addition to the actions already implemented on the risks of flooding and extreme heat, an action plan aimed at reducing water consumption at industrial sites is being drawn up with a view to deployment from 2024.\n\n## Risk of insufficient response to disruption of existing activities\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe  Group's  activities  face  the  risk  of  major  disruptions, such as, for example, the development of digital resources that transform commercial activities and promote disintermediation through the arrival of new players. These developments  pose  threats  in  particular  to  the  Group's distribution strategy and after-sales activities.\n\n## Distribution strategy\n\nThe automotive distribution model faces several challenges that are also risks:\n\n- \u25cf Changing  customer  needs  and  concerns,  with  growing environmental awareness and the need for the network to  contribute  to  the  marketing  of  new  personalised mobility offers;\n- \u25cf Changes  to  regulations,  particularly  European  ones,  to take  account  of  the  changing  commercial  environment due to the development of online car sales;\n- \u25cf The  emergence  of  new  competitors  favouring  direct distribution  to  position  themselves  on  the  European market, and relying on high-performance digital tools;\n- \u25cf Greater profitability and  distribution cost-reduction constraints linked to the macroeconomic environment.\n\n## Risk management\n\nThe  Group's  distribution  strategy  is  being  transformed  to meet these challenges, with the aims of offering a 'phygital' customer experience and developing e-commerce; managing  the  vehicle's  entire  life  cycle  to  maximise profitability and strengthen customer loyalty; and capitalising  on  the  growth  of  the  second-hand  market  to improve financial performance.\n\nWith  the  new  European  distribution  contract  in  early  2024, Renault Group confirms its commitment to the distribution model through a dealer network, with attractive prospects in  terms  of  profitability  and  enabling  Renault  Group  to optimise  its  distribution  costs.  The  network  is  made  up  of dynamic  and  financially  solid  partners  ready  to  invest  in human  and  technological  resources  to  support  the transformation of the automotive industry.\n\nTo  meet  customer  expectations  and  optimise  network productivity,  the  Group  offers  a  physical  sales  and  aftersales experience, for those who prefer human interaction in dealerships, and digital, which can go as far as the complete online journey.\n\nRenault  Group  manages  with  the  network  the  vehicle  life cycle to strengthen customer loyalty and maximise revenue generation  in  sales  and  service  activities  up  to  the  final recycling of the vehicle.\n\nI\n\n04",

It faces three types of risks:\n\n- \u25cf The increase in the number of electric vehicles shall cause the average cost of maintenance and servicing operations  to  fall  due  to  the  less  complex  nature  of electrical  components,  and  it  also  favours  the  arrival  of new players;\n- \u25cf Driver  assistance  systems (ADAS) reduce accidents and therefore the number of repair shop visits;\n- \u25cf The independent after-sales market represents a significant and growing share of the market and is giving rise  to  new  players,  who  are  focused  on  intermediation with a strong digital component.\n\n## Risk management\n\nTo meet after-sales challenges, the Group has implemented an after-sales strategy based on three avenues:\n\n- \u25cf Provide a customer experience at the best level in line with the promises of each of the brands by relying on common, modernised  assets  (use  of  connectivity  data  and  remote software updates, digitisation of the customer experience, logistics tools) to generate more value;\n- \u25cf Deliver  offers  adapted  to  the  entire  life  cycle  of  the vehicle, in terms of repairs and customisation, to increase customer  loyalty,  particularly  among  those  who  own  an older vehicle;\n- \u25cf Develop  a  relevant,  quality  independent  aftermarket (IAM)  offering  based  on  the  manufacturer's  experience, both  physical  and  digital,  to  win  over  new  multibrand customers  and  win  back  customers  who  have  left  our networks.  This  offer  is  supported  by  the  companies Motrio, Kadensis and Fixter.\n\n## Risk of insufficient capacity to develop new businesses\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn  a  context  of  profound,  lasting  transformation  of  mobility demand  and  supply,  in  line  with  societal  changes  and environmental and climate issues, Renault Group  has integrated the development of new businesses into its strategy by surrounding itself with innovative partner companies:\n\n- \u25cf The  energy,  data  and  new  mobility  business  (products and  services)  with  the  Mobilize  Beyond  Automotive business unit;\n- \u25cf Closed-loop  recycling,  with  its  subsidiary  The  Future  Is NEUTRAL, which aims to operate across the entire value chain of the automotive circular economy;\n\n- \u25cf The  development  and  marketing  of  intelligent  mobility systems, with the Software Republic.\n\nUnsuitable governance for this complex ecosystem, a lack of innovations and offers that are out of step with customer expectations could lead to lower-than-expected turnover or have an adverse impact on Renault Group's image.\n\n## Risk management\n\nRenault Group relies on robust governance, with a monthly Group strategy committee and strategic days twice a year, to  ensure  that  this  ecosystem  develops  its  products  and services  by  contributing  to  the  Group's  overall  value  chain and the transformation into a next-generation automotive group.  These  three  entities  present  and  validate  their roadmap in these committees, and the Group thus ensures their effective contribution.\n\n## Risk of ineffectiveness  of partnerships\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRenault Group has set up numerous ecosystems based on partnerships,  joint  ventures  or  commercial  agreements  to support its areas of development, in particular in the electric vehicle value chain (suppliers of batteries, semiconductors and  electric  motors),  in  the  development  of  the  SoftwareDefined Vehicle (see chapter 1.4.3.1), in new forms of mobility and in the development of commercial vehicles, enabling it to benefit from the best technologies and skills.\n\nA  lack  of  control  over  the  decision-making  process  or interpersonal  difficulties  could  generate  results  that  fall short of initial  expectations or are out of step with Renault Group's  strategy,  with  financial  and  reputational  impacts, particularly  with  regard  to  investors.  This  could  also  go  as far as the termination of the partnership, resulting in longer development  times,  increased  production  costs,  reduced production capacity or increased capital expenditure.\n\n## Risk management\n\nRenault  Group  has  put  in  place  a  centralised  governance system  for  partnerships,  co-managed  by  four  permanent key functions: the Finance Division, the Partnership Division, the Legal Division and the Strategy Division. This governance ensures that partnerships are managed in line with  the  Group's  strategic  objectives  while  providing support to the business lines and Business Units that are the business owners of them.\n\nAdditional  actions  on  clarifying  responsibilities,  dynamic performance  monitoring  and  intellectual  property  control were put in place in the last quarter of 2023.",

        "page_content": "## 4.2.2 Risks related to operations\n\n## Risk of supply chain disruption\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRenault  Group's  business  relies  on  a  complex  system  of supply and delivery chains, both upstream and downstream of  its  production  facilities.  Various  components  of  these chains  may  prove  to  be  defective,  despite  the  existing control  system,  the  characteristics  and  strengthening  of which  are  described  below.  These  failures  could  have negative  consequences  for  the  Group's  sales,  turnover, profits or customer satisfaction. They are part of a situation of interdependence  of  the  Group's  industrial  network extended  to  its  suppliers  and  an  unstable  economic  and geopolitical context and can be analysed according to the following typology:\n\n- \u25cf Supplier failure;\n- \u25cf Disruption in supply of raw materials;\n- \u25cf Disruption in supply or transport systems.\n\n## Supplier failure\n\nRenault Group relies on a network of Suppliers of Bought-Out Parts  that  includes  more  than  500  Supplier  Groups  (after  the separation with Horse), of which around forty groups represent around  50%  of  purchase  demand.  The  Horse  entity  will become a tier 1 supplier for gearbox and engine components, thus representing, by nature, Renault Group's leading supplier.\n\nRenault  Group  also  relies  on  around  200  strategic  service provider  groups  in  addition  to  several  thousand  small suppliers working in these areas.\n\nRenault Group suppliers may present risks of failure that may lead  to  the  undesired  interruption  of  commercial  relations and generate risks in terms of compliance in the design and production of parts, compliance with delivery deadlines and provision of the necessary production capacities.\n\nThe nature of risks affecting suppliers can be diverse: financial, strategic,  customer  or  supplier  dependency,  or  industrial, related  to  the  supply  chain.  Renault  also  pays  particular attention  to  the  ESG  (Environment,  Social,  Governance)  risks applied  to  its  suppliers  relating  to  safety  and  respect  for human rights, respect for the environment, carbon impact and compliance, in particular with regard to anticorruption.\n\nIn 2023, more than expected, the semiconductor crisis further influenced the ability of suppliers to deliver to Renault Group on time, with impacts on production. Moreover, energy costs remained high in most countries and, despite the aid provided by  public  authorities,  led  to  a  deterioration  in  the  financial structures  and  cash  flow  of  the  supplier  network.  Suppliers were also impacted by wage increases.\n\nThese  factors  have  contributed  to  maintaining  a  high proportion  of  suppliers  at  risk.  This  proportion,  normally\n\nbetween 5% and 10% of purchase demand, was around 23% in 2023. Against this backdrop, Renault expects an increase in restructuring and mergers/acquisitions in 2024, particularly in industries that will be heavily impacted by the end of the marketing of internal combustion vehicles in the European Union in 2035 (foundry, forging, free cutting, etc.).\n\n## Risk management\n\nThe Group applies a comprehensive risk management system:\n\n- \u25cf Supplier risk prevention policy designed  to  make suppliers responsible for their own risks, compliance, the robustness  of  their  supply  chain  and  their  financial  and strategic management;\n- \u25cf Capacity  guidelines  aimed  at  controlling,  within  a  twoyear time frame, supply risks not covered by the existence of available industrial capacities;\n- \u25cf Process for detecting non-compliance (quality, traceability) of parts delivered;\n- \u25cf Supplier risk management system incorporating multicriteria  ratings  on,  in  particular,  past  and  forecast financial  risks,  strategic  risks  (dependence,  Renault exposure),  industrial  and  supply  risks,  technological breakthroughs, social risks and ESG.\n\nThis  supplier  risk  prevention  and  management  system  is strengthened each year to provide better  coverage  of  the duration and depth of the supplier relationship. The ESG risk management  system  is  included  in  Renault  Group's vigilance plan and described in paragraph 2.5.5.\n\n## Disruption in supply of raw materials\n\nThe  risks  identified  relate  to  potential  supply  restrictions (imbalance  between  supply  and  demand,  sourcing  issues, geopolitical  disturbances),  prices  of  raw  materials,  which can  fluctuate  significantly  and  suddenly,  as  well  as  noncompliance with ESG (Environmental, Social And Governance) criteria. Raw materials account for around one third of the total value of the Group's purchases.\n\n2023 confirmed the end of the high inflationary period, with a return to market prices generally close to the end of 2021 (with the exception of certain materials such as nickel and lithium),  with  volatility  remaining  high.  The  geopolitical context and the regionalisation of markets have continued to  disrupt  existing  supply/demand  balances,  as  has  the gradual  transition  to  carbon-free  materials.  The  steel industry's supply chain was severely disrupted by the delay in several maintenance operations. Some critical materials, such  as  gallium,  germanium  and  rare  earths,  have  been placed under export control by China; the potential impacts are  currently  being  assessed  with  the  suppliers  concerned to determine the appropriate countermeasures.\n\nI\n\nRisk and control\n\n04",

In  its  purchasing  policies,  Renault  Group continues to develop  multi-sourcing for  materials  such  as  steel  or  cast aluminium so as to optimise costs while  securing  supplies. The Group also reinforces the control of materials contained in parts by validating a panel of materials and suppliers and performs a detailed analysis of material prices in the costing of parts.\n\n- \u25cf In  terms  of  technical  policies,  the  Group  is  actively working  to  reduce  the  use  of,  or  to  substitute,  sensitive materials (such as rare earths). It continues to develop the use  of  materials  from  recycling  end-of-life  vehicles. The  Future  Is  NEUTRAL,  the  entity  dedicated  to  the circular economy, is an important lever for optimising the collection  and  reuse  of  these  materials.  Short  loops  on production offcuts are in place or being put in place (steel and aluminium);\n- \u25cf In  a  forward-looking approach, the Group reassesses its forecasts  on  a  bimonthly  basis  for  the  main  materials. At the same time, it ensures ongoing monitoring of critical materials markets and suppliers;\n- \u25cf Renault Group secures the supply of responsible strategic materials contained in batteries and partners with players in the value chain (battery producers, suppliers of cathode active materials, etc.) to share qualification and use. With this  in  mind,  agreements  to  supply  lithium,  low-carbon nickel  and  cobalt  were  signed  in  2021,  2022  and  2023. Renault  Group  plans  to  extend  this  type  of  agreement  to materials other than those specific to batteries;\n- \u25cf Lastly,  to  reduce  risks  and  limit  exposure  to  market fluctuations, Renault  Group  negotiates  annual  raw materials  supply  contracts  whenever  possible  and appropriate.  A  systematic  financial  hedging  policy  has been put in place for the main indexed commodities.\n\n## Disruption of supply or transport systems\n\nIn terms of logistics, the risks relate to possible failures in the planning, production, transport or delivery of parts, upstream  of  production  sites,  or  vehicles  to  the  sales network, which could have an impact on sales, turnover and profits of the Group or even customer satisfaction.\n\nThese risks include the capacity risk for transport due to a lack  of  drivers  (impact  of  the  war  in  Ukraine),  means  of transport (trucks, ships, containers) or port congestion; the risk  of  increased logistics costs due, in particular, to higher energy prices and new regulations, including those relating to  European  road  transport  (e.g.  mobility  package  for drivers);  cybersecurity  risk  for  logistics  suppliers;  and  risks relating  to  the  geopolitical  context  (e.g.  border  closures, insecurity in certain geographical areas).\n\n## Risk management\n\nThe series of various crises (COVID-19, climatic disasters, the electronic  components  crisis,  the  earthquakes  in  Morocco and  Turkey,  the  war  in  Ukraine)  have  demonstrated  the ability of the supply chain to work in a short loop to be more responsive  to  fluctuations  in  the  environment,  thanks  to  a comprehensive  and  increasingly  robust  prevention  and protection system:\n\n- \u25cf Better balance  between  commercial  demand  and industrial  response  thanks  to  the  effectiveness  of  new digital  tools  in  an  integrated  process  for  planning  sales and operational activities;\n- \u25cf A central crisis management system for the supply chain, tried and tested over many years, and the involvement of all  the  business  lines  concerned  to  ensure  the  best possible  response  to  one-off  crises  and  unforeseen events;\n- \u25cf Enhanced  collaboration  with  our  logistics  suppliers  on medium- and long-term volume visibility  to  limit  the  risk on transport capacity (on road and at sea);\n- \u25cf Gradual implementation from the second half of 2023 of the  supply  chain  control  tower,  making  it  possible, through the digitisation of processes and an end-to-end vision,  to  anticipate  and  manage  crises  in  a  coherent, coordinated  way  within  Renault  Group.  For  example,  for the  transport  of  parts,  the  Control  Tower  provides  realtime  information  on  the  risks  of  truck  delays,  measures the  impact  on  factory  stocks  and  suggests  alternative solutions  to  avoid  a  factory  stoppage  (emergency transport, change of route or alternative truck);\n- \u25cf Deployment  of  an  action  plan  aimed  at  reducing  the cybersecurity risk of procurement systems and requests for TISAX certification when joining the panel of logistics suppliers.\n\n## Risks related to geopolitical instability and economic conditions\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRenault Group has industrial and commercial operations in a  large  number  of  countries.  Some  of  these  countries  may present  specific  risks  related  to  adverse  macroeconomic conditions, political or regulatory instability, armed conflicts or  social  unrest.  These  situations  may  result  in  risks  to  the safety of Group employees, supply shortages, import/export restrictions  and  economic  sanctions,  business  interruption or  destruction  of  assets,  restrictions  on  the  transfer  of money flows to  the  parent  company,  and  expropriation  of Group  assets,  ultimately  impacting  the  Group's  turnover, income statement or balance sheet.\n\nIn  2023, the economic situation continued to be marked by the  energy  and  commodities  crisis,  linked  to  the  war  in Ukraine,  high  inflation  in  most  countries  and  increased volatility  of  interest  rates  and  exchange  rates.  The  Hamas attacks on Israel on 7 October 2023, and the Israeli response that followed put the Israeli-Palestinian conflict back at the heart of international concerns. A possible regional escalation of the conflict could have global repercussions.",

The respective  weights  in  the  Group's  vehicle  sales  and production  are  as  follows  for  each  of  these  countries  or areas (see chapter 1.3): Morocco (3%, 16%), Turkey (8%, 14%) and the 'Americas' (12%, 12%). Despite their limited weight in the  Group's  vehicle  sales  and  production,  China  and  the Asia-Pacific region occupy a crucial place in the battery and electric-vehicle value chain.\n\nThe  strong  political  polarisation  in  most  Latin  American countries,  particularly  in  Brazil,  Colombia  and  Argentina, remains  a  source  of  tension  and  instability.  This  region  is also experiencing a particularly difficult economic environment, with a very high rate of inflation for Argentina. In Asia, the strategic rivalry between the United States and China has intensified in recent years and could continue in the  long  term.  Geopolitical  tension  between  the  two countries  is  centred  around  Taiwan.  The  supply  chains  of batteries and  electric  vehicles  would  be  particularly vulnerable in the event of a conflict in the region.\n\n## Risk management\n\nIn terms of industrial location, Renault Group's geographical  choices  are  made  taking  into  account  the risks  of  instability.  Calculations  of  expected  returns  on investment include country-specific risk premiums. From an operational standpoint, the Group  continuously increases the level of local integration in order to reduce the  impact  of  political  and  foreign  exchange  risks  and make its products more competitive. In terms of sales, the risk of exposure is limited because in 2023, the European market accounted for more than two thirds (70%) of the Group's sales (see the Group's worldwide sales in chapter 1.3.1, as well as details of sales by country).\n\nThe  'star'  invoicing  scheme  developed  by  Renault  Group (sale  by  the  manufacturing  subsidiaries  of  their  exported production to Renault s.a.s., which resell it to the commercial subsidiaries and independent importers) makes it possible to centralise the management of non-payment risks and cover these  risks  on  competitive  terms.  Since  November  2023, Ampere s.a.s. has applied the same scheme for resale to sales subsidiaries  (and  indirectly  through  an  invoicing  to  Renault s.a.s. for independent importers).\n\nIn  addition,  Renault  Group  has  continued  to  reduce  fixed costs  and  restructure  industrial  capacity  to  lower  the company's breakeven point, thereby increasing its resilience in the event of risks that have a significant impact on  its  operations.  The  global  inflationary  environment  is integrated into the Group's budget assumptions and market forecasts, and scenario sensitivity analyses are performed.\n\nThe conflict in Ukraine and its consequences on the Group's activity  continue  to  be  monitored  on  an  ongoing  basis.  In particular,  Renault  Group  has  set  up  a  sanction  watch. Sanctions  are  analysed  and  translated  into  action  plans mobilising  all  the  divisions  involved  to  ensure  that  the Group's  activities  always  comply  with  the  applicable\n\nregulations.  The  Group  remains  vigilant  about  the  possible regional  consequences  of  the  war  between  Israel  and Hamas.\n\n## Workforce Risk\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn  an  unstable  economic,  environmental  and  geopolitical context,  major  changes  are  putting  pressure  on  the company's  activity.  In  this  situation,  the  'Renaulution' strategic  plan  entails  a  transformation  that  leads  to changes  in  the  organisation  and  new  business  models,  in particular through  the  creation  of  new  entities  and partnerships.  Energy  transition  issues  and  aggravating external  factors  such  as  the  shortage  of  electronic components and rising  prices  of  raw  materials  could  lead the  Group  to  take  measures  relating  to  the  employment conditions of its people. In addition, an increase in inflation in countries where Renault Group has significant operations could lead to pressure on costs at the local level.\n\nIn  this  environment,  the  Group  runs  the  risk  of  being confronted with social movements in the countries where it operates, which could disrupt its activities.\n\n## Risk management\n\nBuilding  on  its  global  framework  agreements  of  2013  and 2019,  Renault  Group  has  a  dynamic  of  dialogue  between management and labour both at the global level through its Group  Works  Council  and  at  the  local  level  with  employee representative  bodies.  Renault  Group  is  committed  to dealing  with  these  changes  and  the  associated  risks through  regular,  quality  dialogue  between  management and  labour,  allowing  global  and  local  agreements  to  be reached, and to developing these bodies if necessary.\n\n## Risk of natural, health or industrial disasters\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe  Group's  operating  sites,  whether  manufacturing  sites, engineering and testing centres, logistics platforms or even commercial  sites  are  exposed  to  the  risk  of  industrial accidents,  fires,  explosions  and  machine  breakdowns.  In addition,  certain  sites  are  subject  to  risks  of  natural disasters: earthquakes (particularly in Chile, Turkey, Romania  and  Morocco),  but  also  floods  or  submersions (particularly  in  France  and  South  Korea).  These  risks  are reinforced  by  the  increased  frequency  of  extreme  climate events linked to global warming.\n\nThe occurrence of any of these risks, despite the prevention and resilience  policies  presented  below,  could  harm  people, the  environment  or  the  sites  concerned  and  lead  to significant disruptions in the ability to operate affected sites potentially  damaging  the  Group's  assets  and/or  overall performance (sales,  turnover,  income  statement  or  balance sheet), particularly through industrial interdependencies.\n\nA  global  pandemic  similar  to  COVID-19  could  lead  to significant and evolving health threats in some or all of the countries  in  which  the  Group  operates.

For  example,  more  than  96%  of  the  assets (industry,  engineering  and  logistics,  including  the  HORSE scope)  covered  by  the  'property  damage  and  business interruption'  insurance  programme  were  awarded  the international  'Highly  Protected  Risk  (HPR)'  label  in  2023, which reflects a level of prevention and protection approved by insurance companies.\n\nFurthermore,  the  entire  Group  is  working  to  increase  its resilience  capacity  in  the  face  of  natural  disasters.  In particular, seismic  risk  management  is  continuing  in Romania,  Turkey  and  Chile,  with  multiyear  plans  covering, depending  on  the  site,  the  reinforcement  of  buildings  and facilities,  staff  training,  specific  communication  resources, crisis management  systems,  business  continuity  and appropriate  insurance  programmes.  Following  the  major earthquakes in Turkey and Morocco in 2023, which did not affect  our  industrial  sites,  Renault  Group  will  analyse  any deviations from the new earthquake requirements in these countries when they appear.\n\nIn the event of a health crisis, Renault Group would be able to rapidly  reactivate  the  systems  tested  during  the  COVID-19 crisis  in  order  to  protect  the  health  of  employees  in conjunction  with  the  public  authorities,  preserve  its  assets and its ability to operate, and adapt to changing situations in the various countries.\n\n## 4.2.3 Risks related to products and services\n\nRisk of inadequate definition, product and service delivery or innovation\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn  a  highly  competitive  and  fast-changing  automotive market, in terms of regulations, customer expectations and trends  and  technologies,  Renault  Group  is  exposed  to  the risk  of  an  inadequate  match  between  its  capacity  for innovation,  its  product  and  service  offering  and  the expectations of the various markets. Such a situation could have  a  negative  impact  on  its  sales,  turnover  or  income statement.\n\nSpecific risks have been identified relating to:\n\n- \u25cf The  enhancement  of  the  technological  content  of vehicles  and  associated  ecosystems,  especially  with regard  to  vehicle  connectivity  and  related  services, electronics  and  software,  and  electrified  and,  in  the longer term, autonomous vehicles;\n- \u25cf The  continuous  increase  in  vehicle  costs  caused  by tougher  regulations  (some  of  which  have  uncertain timing, which is incompatible with the development lead times,  such  as  Euro  7)  and  an  inflationary  environment, which  could  prove  difficult  to  pass  on  correctly  in  sales prices,  thus  weakening the economic equations and the future of certain products;\n- \u25cf The ongoing transition of the engine offering in terms of technologies  (combustion,  hybrid  and  electric  engines) and mix: this range of technologies may not be perfectly suited to customers' budgets, their uses, the CO2 emission thresholds of various countries/markets and the Group's CAFE trajectory;\n- \u25cf The  preservation  of  the  profitability  of  the  investments that Renault Group intends to maintain at around 8% of\n\nturnover until 2025, which could increase the risk weighing on  the  choices  made  regarding  innovations  and  the chances  of  seeing  those  innovations  match  the  real expectations  of  customers  and  therefore  generate returns on investment.\n\nIn  addition  to  certain  risks  mentioned  above,  the  electric vehicle activity is particularly affected by:\n\n- \u25cf Intense competition from incumbent market players and more recent players, particularly in 2023, whether or not they  specialise  in  the  sale  of  electric  vehicles:  some players, carmakers or battery suppliers, especially Asian players, benefit from significantly lower production costs than  those  of  European  manufacturers  because  of economies  of  scale,  direct  and  localised  access  to  raw materials, lower energy and labour costs and potentially subsidies (EU study in progress);\n- \u25cf The risk that consumer demand for electric vehicles will be weaker than expected, due in particular to perceptions of quality, safety, range and price and to the volatility of the  cost  of  oil,  petrol  and  electricity  depending  on  the period and the country;\n- \u25cf The  risk  of  changes  or  reductions  in  public  policies relating to electric vehicles, such as purchase incentives, changes  to  CAFE  and  development  of  recharging infrastructure.\n\nShould  the  reference  assumptions  used  in  the  Group's product  development  decisions  be  strongly  called  into question,  the  Group  may  have  to  recognise  impairment  on fixed  assets  (investment  and  capitalised  development expenses, depreciated over the life of the vehicle) or book a provision to cover the contractual indemnities to be paid, if any, due to the failure to meet a minimum purchase volume.",

It  is  also  increasingly informed,  on  a  global  scale,  by  anticipatory  technology watch  by  all  of  the  Group's  development  stakeholders,  of the  automotive  industry  and  beyond.  These  teams  are based  or  have  direct  links  with  the  most  innovative geographical  areas,  for  example  in  China,  Israel  and  the United States. The  development  of  new  models  or components  is  decided  on  the  basis  of  this  work  and  an evaluation  of  the  anticipated  profitability,  calculated  over the projected life cycle.\n\nThe organisation of Renault Group into brands and business units,  supported  by  partnerships,  enables  it  to  best  meet market expectations:\n\n- \u25cf Organisation by brand makes it possible to be as close as possible  to  consumer  expectations:  the  brands  are  able to  make  the  most  relevant  choices  and  decisions  to strengthen their identity and can rely on the expertise of the  central  functions  and  the  bodies  and  technologies developed by Renault Group or with its partners;\n- \u25cf The new Ampere subsidiary is developing electrical and software  expertise  and  searching  for  battery  sourcing opportunities as close as possible to plants and decarbonised energy sources. The choice of two versions per  car  combining  battery  at  a  competitive  cost, for example in partnership with Envision AESC, and highperformance  battery,  for  example  with  the  startup Verkor, and the design of a standardised cell architecture make  it  possible  to  reduce  manufacturing  costs  and increase the energy efficiency of batteries;\n- \u25cf The numerous partnerships established by the Group (see chapter 1.3.4) allow it to rely on the best to keep pace with market innovation.\n\nFrom  a  general  perspective,  to  ensure  the  robustness  of  the product plan and keep risks under control, the Group strives to:\n\n- \u25cf Maximise the distribution of the same model in different markets, which reduces its exposure to possible fluctuations in one of these markets;\n- \u25cf Optimise outlay by simultaneously developing cars in the same segment for several brands;\n- \u25cf Offer a varied, balanced product portfolio (see chapter  1.3.1) that  meets  customer  expectations  in different  segments  and  markets  to  reduce  the  risk  of dependence  on  a  single  market,  segment  or  customer\n\ntype;  In  the  electric  vehicle  market,  Renault  Group  is integrating  into  its  range  vehicles  at  affordable  prices that are competitive with Asian competitors, in particular the  Dacia  Spring,  the  Renault  Twingo  and  soon  the Renault 5;\n\n- \u25cf Offer  a  diversified  and  adaptable  engine  portfolio  (ICE, LPG,  hybrid,  plug-in  hybrid,  electric,  hydrogen)  to  meet customer  expectations  in  different  markets  and  enable potential changes in the engine mix to be supported;\n- \u25cf Develop  vehicle  projects  with  OEM  partners  inside  or outside the Alliance to share development costs;\n- \u25cf Manage  the  main  project  development  milestones  and reduce  development  lead-times  to  secure  the  launch schedule for new products: the upstream phases are now more  robust  in  terms  of  their  level  of  detail,  their  360\u00b0 business  vision  and  a  handover  (starting  from  the Concept Freeze milestone) to the brands and downstream of the company.\n\n## Risk of product or service quality defects\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe quality of Renault Group's products and services could be considered  insufficiently competitive  by  potential customers  in  the  face  of  the  competition,  which  would adversely  affect  the  satisfaction  of  its  customers  or partners,  and  negatively  affect  its  sales,  turnover,  costs  or reputation.\n\nThis  risk  arises  in  the  context  of  the  rapid  development  of automotive technologies implemented by the Group as part of its strategic plan.\n\n## Risk management\n\nControl of this risk was enhanced by the launch of a specific Quality  plan.  It  relies  in  particular  on  quality  assurance systems implemented within the Group's operating activities  as  well  as  on  functional  safety  organisation  and activities  and  general  product  safety,  aiming  to  protect against the risks related to the physical integrity of people involved in  road  use,  starting  with  the  users  of  the  Group's products and services.\n\nRenault Group has also set up a market monitoring system that  allows  it  to  become  aware  of  sources  of  customer dissatisfaction  very  quickly  and  to  act  accordingly.  This  is done,  in  particular,  through  a  quality  problem  correction process,  which  has  been  strengthened,  including  a  recall process for, as a priority, those that could have regulatory or potentially safety-related consequences.\n\nI\n\n04",

Developments in the Group's strategy and its new challenges (cloud strategy, digitisation, Industry  4.0,  increase  in  connectivity  and  dependence  on vehicle  software,  development  of  connected  services  or strengthening of the cybersecurity regulatory environment in  particular)  are  contributing  to  increasing  its  exposure  to threats and making cybersecurity a major issue.\n\nThe  main  risks  that  could  adversely  affect  the  Group's activities  are  related  to  'cybercrime':  global  computerised attacks or attacks targeting the Group's interests or, as a side effect,  national  interests.  These  attacks,  in  a  context  of strong  growth,  may  aim  to  access  sensitive  data  (strategic, product, service or personal data), steal or alter such data, or block services or even all of the Group's information systems:\n\n- \u25cf Incidents  that  could  affect  the  continuity  of  services, present in the vehicles, hosted in our infrastructures and those of our partners and suppliers;\n- \u25cf Non-compliance with IT standards or practices required by legislation, external authorities or contracts with suppliers or the state of the art.\n\nThe  materialisation  of  these  risks,  despite  the  continuous strengthening of systems aimed at controlling them, could have major financial impacts associated with the temporary suspension of the Group's activities (turnover, net income),  remediation  costs  for  vehicles  and  infrastructure, penalties  or  increased  insurance  premiums.  There  could also  be  adverse  impacts  on  the  Group's  image  and  the confidence of third parties and customers in the Group and its brands.\n\nIn addition, Renault  Group's  increased  marketing  of connected  vehicles  and  services  is  accompanied  by  the emergence  of  risks  of  a  comparable  nature,  for  which insufficiently  robust  and  sustainable  management  could lead to adverse impacts on safety and the reliability of data, services or vehicles.\n\n## Risk management\n\nThe  general  control  of  these  risks  is  currently  provided ensured by:\n\n- \u25cf A  cybersecurity  organisation  across  the  company  in order to protect all Group assets and products;\n- \u25cf The  deployment  of  security  policies, translated into operational procedures, and the continuous enrichment of the process of defining security requirements according to the level of criticality of the applications and data handled;\n- \u25cf Governance Committees monitoring and evaluating the effectiveness  of  information  security  processes  and measures;\n\n- \u25cf The  deployment  of  an  evolving  action  plan  based  on  a security  master  plan  and  annual  risk  mapping.  The security master plan is updated and presented regularly to the Audit and Risk Committee (CAR).\n\nIn view of the Group's key strategic priorities, its digitalisation and the evolution of threats, the major actions to  optimise  risk  management are currently focused on the following areas:\n\n- \u25cf Monitoring by reviewing performance metrics;\n- \u25cf A major programme to strengthen security at the Group's various plants;\n- \u25cf Development  of  vehicle  cybersecurity  and  associated services in connection with the need to comply with the new regulations (UNECE R155 & R156) on vehicle cybersecurity;\n- \u25cf Enhanced supervision (Security Operations Center - SOC) of  systems in all the Group's domains (in particular IS/IT, vehicles,  connected  services,  cloud  infrastructure  and plants);\n- \u25cf Strengthening of awareness, training and skills regarding cybersecurity;\n- \u25cf Strengthening of the protection of the Group's systems/ infrastructures (including those that use cloud hosting);\n- \u25cf Participation  in  international  and  national  ecosystem interest groups (e.g. PFA, Campus Cyber, ACEA and OICA).\n\n## Risk of ineffective digital transformation\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn 2016, the Group initiated a digital transformation that, led by the IT function, aims to allow all the Functions to improve their  productivity,  reduce  their  costs  and  create  new sources of value. This transformation involves both organisational and technical changes.\n\nThe  growing  complexity  associated  with  the  numerous interfaces between the information systems of the various functions,  a  lack  of  internal  and  external  skills  and inefficient governance in general are all risks that could lead to  poor  quality  of  products  or  platforms,  a  delay  in  the digital transformation,  insufficient productivity in the business  lines  and  ultimately  a  lower-quality  customer experience and a loss of the Group's competitiveness.\n\n## Risk management\n\nThe  digital  transformation  is  governed  by  each  function, and  the  Renault  Digital  subsidiary  is  accelerating  this transformation.  In  2022,  the  Group  specified  its  five-year, medium-term  digital  plan.  A  total  of  eight  business  areas have been defined as new value chains for the Group: digital development of vehicles, industrial performance, upstream and  downstream  logistics,  sales  and  customer  service, after-sales, support functions, service development, operation of sales and services.",

For  each  of  the  digital  initiatives,  business  line/IT  comanagement has been put in place with the aim of securing the  digital  challenges  that  will  make  it  possible  to  achieve the expected business results, with particular attention paid to  the  necessary skills and the proper architecture of data and digital solutions.\n\n## Risk of a lack of resources and talent\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn light of the digital revolution, rapid  technological breakthroughs and new needs in terms of mobility services, the  Group's  aim  is  to  turn  itself  into  a  competitive technology  and  services  company.  As  a  result,  its  skills requirements are evolving at all qualification levels, and the Group  must  ensure  that  it  has  the  best  professionals.  The company must meet the challenge of attracting, retaining and developing talent. Thus, in a highly competitive labour market, which is no longer limited to the automotive segment, the risk for  the  company is that it will not be able to attract or retain the  talent  needed  to  fulfil  its  strategic  ambitions  or  for  its transformation.\n\n## Risk management\n\nTo  constantly  adapt  to  transformed  roles  in  the  automotive segment  and  to  shape  future  mobility,  Renault  Group  has introduced  an  HR  policy  to  make  it  fast-moving,  innovative, effective and eager to learn, and to support the commitment and motivation of its employees on the basis of the following actions:\n\n- \u25cf Recruitment of staff with a very wide range of profiles and expertise in all the countries in which the Group operates;\n- \u25cf Promotion of diversity and inclusion: the Group's ambition to be the employer of choice in the automotive industry for women and to boost their representation in management positions;\n- \u25cf Employee development and training through  an  adapted, personalised and modernised training offer, supported by an  extended  community  (ReKnow  University,  Learning  & Development);\n- \u25cf A competitive compensation policy combined  with enhanced performance monitoring and appraisal;\n- \u25cf A  solid,  international  and  cross-functional  approach  to identify, develop and retain talent;\n- \u25cf Anchoring  of  the  Group's  values  and  the  integration  of professional  conduct  as  a  benchmark  in  all  development processes or programmes.\n\n## Risk of non-compliance with laws and regulations, including corruption\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBecause of its international activity, Renault Group is subject to numerous, complex, dynamic laws and regulations, specific to  automobiles  or  not  (vehicle  technical  regulations,  general product safety, competition law, export control and international  sanctions,  labour  law,  cybersecurity,  protection of personal data, etc.)\n\nThe Group could therefore find itself exposed to a change in laws  or  regulations  that  were  insufficiently  anticipated  or incorrectly  taken  into  account  by  the  existing  management system.\n\nThese differences in anticipation or failure to account for such changes  in  laws  or  regulations  could  result  in,  for  the  Group and its senior executives, possible criminal, administrative or financial  penalties,  an  impairment  of  the  Group's  ability  to engage  in  its  operational  activities,  with  an  impact  on  its turnover and earnings, and deterioration of its image.\n\n## Risk management\n\nRenault Group has entrusted advising departments, experts in their  field,  with  the  responsibility  of  building  and  managing their regulatory compliance  system  within  the  Group. In particular, in their respective fields, they are responsible for organising  regulatory  monitoring,  defining  the  policies  and procedures  applicable  within  the  Group,  coordinating  their network  in  France  and  abroad,  providing  training  to  the populations concerned and implementing controls, with the support  of other functions (in particular, the Quality Department  and  the  Internal  Control  Department).  In addition,  Renault  Group  asks  its  subsidiaries  to  take  part  in ongoing  dialogue  with  the  national  or  regional  authorities responsible for the specific regulations governing products in the automotive industry in order to anticipate any changes.\n\nFor  example,  compliance  with  competition  law  is  the responsibility  of  the  Legal  Department,  which  relies  on  a network  of  lawyers  to  deploy  the  system  within  the  Group and to take into account specific requirements under local regulations where necessary. The personal data protection compliance system (in particular, GDPR compliance) is the responsibility  of  the  Data  Protection  Officer  (DPO),  who  is part of the Digital and IT Department and works closely with the  Legal  Department.  The  DPO  relies  on  a  network  of Privacy Ambassadors covering all company functions. DPOs are appointed in the subsidiaries to run the system locally. The Ethics and Compliance Department (DEC) is responsible for the anticorruption action plan.\n\nWith  the  support  of  the  Legal  Department  and  under  the supervision of the Ethics and Compliance Committee (CEC), the DEC ensures that the regulatory compliance systems in each of the areas are robust. The maturity of our compliance systems  is  measured  quarterly  using  an  index  covering various  aspects  (monitoring,  policies  and  procedures,  risk ranking,  training,  etc.)  and  is  presented  to  the  Ethics  and Compliance Committee (CEC).\n\nI\n\n04",

In  its criticality analysis, the Group uses an overall assessment of these components, presented below in no particular order.\n\n## Litigation\n\nRenault Group is exposed to a risk as to the assessment and completeness of the amounts that could be disbursed in the context of ongoing litigation.\n\nIn general, these proceedings could result in the payment of fines or damages that could have a negative impact on the Group's  operating  income  and  financial  position.  In  this case,  these  proceedings  could  also  have  an  effect  on  the Group's  reputation  with  consumers  and  indirectly  reduce the attractiveness of the vehicles that it markets.\n\n## Market monitoring\n\nLike any manufacturer, Renault Group is exposed to the risk of non-compliance  of  the  products  that  it  markets  and  their withdrawal  from  the  market.  In  a  context  of  particular sensitivity  to  ecological  issues,  changes  in  case  law  and stricter applicable regulations, this risk appears to be high for internal combustion engine vehicles marketed by the Group.\n\n## Intellectual property\n\nRenault  Group's  industrial  know-how,  innovations  resulting from research and the products marketed are the subject of patents, trademarks, designs and models filed to protect the Group's intellectual property. Each year, Renault Group files a  significant  number  of  patents,  trademarks,  designs  and models in its area of activity (see chapter 1.4).  The major risk facing Renault Group in terms of intellectual property is the risk of counterfeiting, whether innocent or deliberate.\n\nCounterfeiting  may  be  committed  by  third  parties  against the  products,  industrial  processes,  brands,  designs  and models  protected  by  Renault  Group.  From  a  technological standpoint, given Renault Group's reputation, particularly in the  field  of  hybrid  and  electric  vehicles,  the  Group  could\n\nbecome  a  prime  target  for  such  counterfeiting.  Renault Group's  E-TECH  technology  is  a  significant  example. As regards trademarks, designs and models, repercussions can be felt in particular in the replacement market. Renault Group's existing reputation is a key factor in increasing the risk of counterfeiting.\n\nAny  such  actions  could  have  an  immediate  unfavourable impact on the Group's turnover and earnings and may harm the  reputation  and  quality  image  of  the  technologies  and products concerned.\n\nDeliberate  infringement  could  be  an  involuntary  act  by Renault  Group,  given  the  risk  associated  with  the  period during  which  patent  applications  are  not  made  public. Patent applications filed by third parties and known only at the time of publication could force Renault Group to modify a  product  under  development,  increasing  the  project's Research and Development costs, or to negotiate rights to use  the  patented  item.  In  either  case,  the  project's  margin would  be  affected.  This  risk  is  particularly  present  in  the context of connectivity and standard essential patents.\n\n## Risk management\n\nThe control of legal risks is based in particular on an internal control system organised around three guiding principles:\n\n- \u25cf Management  of  the  Group's  legal  function,  which  is organised around a central function and employees in the Group's  main  countries.  These  employees  report  on  a hierarchical and/or functional basis;\n- \u25cf Employees  of  the  legal  function  are  proactive  in anticipating  legal  risks  upstream  and  adapting  the corresponding procedures (advisory consultations, information from the central legal function, etc.);\n- \u25cf Regulatory monitoring by Renault Group in collaboration with the different countries concerned.\n\nPatents,  trademarks,  designs  and  models  registered  by Renault  Group  in  the  Group's  main  automotive  markets provide  it  with  an  effective  weapon  in  the  fight  against counterfeiting. In addition, with regard to trademarks, the establishment of customs monitoring in various countries allows  the  reporting  of  dubious  products,  both  imports and exports.",

        "page_content": "## 4.2.5 Financial risks\n\n## Foreign exchange risk\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe international expansion of its activities leaves the Group exposed to foreign exchange risk. This risk is related to the fluctuation  of  the  various  currencies  against  the  euro  and mainly impacts the Group's Automotive activity .\n\nThis  activity  is  exposed  to  foreign  exchange  risk  mainly  at the level of the operating margin, and the Group may hedge some  of  this  exposure  on  an  ad  hoc  basis.  Based  on  the structure of its results and operating cash flows for 2023, an increase of 1% in the euro against all currencies would have a negative impact of \u20ac9 million on the Automotive Division's annual operating margin after hedging (detailed impact by currency in Note 25-B2 to the financial statements).\n\nThe  financial  result,  the  share  in  the  result  of  associates, shareholders' equity and the net liquidity position may also be impacted by fluctuations in exchange rates against the euro.  In  particular,  the  Group  has  a  stake  in  Nissan,  and therefore holds a net asset in yen whose fluctuations impact the  value  of  the  securities  in  assets  and  the  Group's translation reserves in liabilities. For the 2023 financial year, the  impact  of  a  1%  increase  in  the  euro  against  the  yen would  represent  a  reduction  of  \u20ac150  million  in  Nissan's contribution to Group equity and a reduction of \u20ac8 million in the  Group's  income  from  associated  companies  (see notes 12-C and  25-B2  to  the  consolidated  financial statements).  In  addition,  the  Group  partially  hedges  the foreign exchange risk related to its investment in Nissan by issuing loans in Japanese yen, which impacts its net liquidity position.  Thus,  a  1%  rise  in  the  euro  against  the  yen  would increase the net cash position by \u20ac13 million.\n\nThe  Sales  Financing  segment is  exposed,  to  a  more  limited extent,  to  the  risk  of  exchange  rate  fluctuations,  which  may nevertheless have a negative impact on its financial position.\n\n## Risk management\n\nThe  foreign  exchange  risk  management  policy  for  the automotive  segment is  deployed  and  monitored  by the Performance  and  Control  Department  and  the  Financing and Treasury Department (DFT).\n\nAny hedging of foreign  exchange  risk  in  the  operating  margin must undergo prior analysis by these Departments, be formally authorised by the Finance Department or the Senior Management  and  be  reported  to  the  Chief  Financial  Officer each month. Whenever possible, foreign exchange transactions are carried out by the Group's trading room (Renault Finance) for currencies traded on international markets.\n\nIn 2023, in order to limit the exposure of its operating margin to  foreign  exchange  risk,  the  Automotive  segment  set  up\n\nRisk and control\n\ncurrency  hedges  on  the  Argentine  peso,  the  Chinese  yuan and the Turkish lira.\n\nIn  addition,  to  avoid  any  distortion  of  the  financial  result linked to foreign exchange fluctuations, the exchange rate risk  linked  to  financing  and  cash  management  flows  in foreign currencies is systematically minimised. Cash surpluses  in  countries  not  centralised  at  the  parent company are generally invested in local currency under the supervision  of  the  DFT.  Financing  transactions  are  carried out  in  the  accounting  currency  of  each  entity  or,  when carried  out  in  foreign  currencies,  are  hedged  in  the  same currency  under  the  supervision  of  the  DFT.  Any  residual exposures  (including  those  resulting  from  Renault  Finance operations)  are  subject  to  derogations  and  are  reported monthly to the Chief Financial Officer.\n\nEquity  investments  (in  currencies  other  than  the  euro)  are not usually hedged. This may lead to translation adjustments recognised in Group equity. However, given the investment in Nissan, Renault's share in Nissan's net worth has been partially covered by a specific foreign exchange hedge  (see  note  12-G  to  the  consolidated  financial statements).  The  Group  may  be  required  to  hedge  its exposure  to  foreign  exchange  risk  on  the  share  of  equity held in Nissan, within the limit of the share in yen of Nissan's equity and its assessment of the liquidity risk on the yen.\n\nThe  management  of  foreign  exchange  risk  by  the  Sales Financing  segment distinguishes  between  transactional and  structural  foreign  exchange  risk.  With  regard  to transactional  foreign  exchange  risk,  most  Sales  Financing subsidiaries  have  a  single-currency  business  and  are therefore  not  exposed  to  foreign  exchange  risk.  However, some subsidiaries finance assets denominated in different currencies. Their transactional foreign exchange position is subject  to  limits,  and  the  residual  exposure  is  kept  at  a marginal level for Mobilize FS. On 31 December 2023, Mobilize FS's  consolidated  transactional  foreign  exchange  position (excluding equity investments in subsidiaries) amounted to \u20ac17.9  million.  Mobilize  FS  also  has  long-term  investments  in many  countries  outside  the  eurozone.  These  investments are  of  strategic  importance  to  Mobilize  FS  and  are integrated into the Group's risk management.  They generate  a  structural  exposure  to  foreign  exchange  risk, which is  managed with two main objectives: (a)  to  protect the  Group's  consolidated  capital  ratios  from  the  impacts resulting from changes in currency exchange rates and (b) to  meet  local  regulatory  requirements  in  terms  of  capital ratios with an appropriate buffer. Open positions may result in  asset  losses  (equity  write-downs)  if  the  currency  in question depreciates. Mobilize FS has established limits on the maximum loss realised by keeping these positions open.\n\nFor further details on the management of foreign exchange risk, see note 25-B2 to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nI\n\n04",

In the event of prolonged market closures or pressure on access to credit, the Group is exposed to liquidity risk. If the Group's funding requirements  increase  or  if  the  Group  is  unable  to  access new  sources  of  funding,  insufficient  liquidity  would  be particularly  detrimental  to  its  competitiveness,  operating results and financial position.\n\nLiquidity  risk  is  the  risk  of  the  Automotive  and  Sales Financing segments experiencing reduced liquidity to repay their  debts  as  they  fall  due  or  to  finance  balance  sheet growth. The Group's liquidity could be significantly affected by  factors  beyond  its  control,  such  as  general  market disruptions,  the  market's  perception  of  increased  liquidity risk or speculative pressure in the debt market.\n\nThe  Automotive  and  Sales  Financing  activities  are  also rated by several agencies. Any downgrading of their ratings could limit and/or increase the cost of access to the capital markets for these Group activities.\n\nThe  financial  ratings  of  Renault  SA  are  presented  below (dated 31 December 2023).\n\n| Agency   | Rating & Outlook        | Date of last review   |\n|----------|-------------------------|-----------------------|\n| Moody's  | Ba1*/NP/Stable outlook* | August 2023           |\n| S&P      | BB+/B/Stable outlook*   | February 2023         |\n| R&I      | A-/Stable outlook**     | March 2023            |\n| JCR      | A-/Stable outlook       | November 2022         |\n\n* Change in rating.\n\nA  detailed  schedule  of  financial  liabilities  related  to  the Automotive  and  Sales  Financing  activities  is  presented  in note 23-D to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nFor  more  details  on  liquidity  risk,  see  note  25-B1  to  the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Risk management\n\nLiquidity risk of the Automotive segment is managed by the DFT.  This  management is based on an internal model that defines the level of the liquidity reserve that the Automotive activity must maintain to finance its activity and its growth. This  liquidity  reserve  level  is  subject  to  close  monthly monitoring  through  a  periodic  review  and  reporting  to  the Chief Financial Officer.\n\nIn  2023,  Renault  S.A.  maintained  its  access  to  short-term financing by using its NEU CP programme.\n\nIn  addition,  in  2023,  Renault  S.A.  fully  repaid  the  \u20ac4  billion initially  drawn  in  2020  under  the  bank  credit  agreement guaranteed by the French government.\n\nThe  contractual  documentation  for  Renault  SA's  funding, including bank loans and credit lines, does not contain any clause  that  might  adversely  affect  credit  availability  as  a result  of  a  change  in  Renault  Group's  credit  rating  or  its compliance with financial ratios.\n\nOn  31  December  2023,  the  Automotive  activity's  liquidity reserve totalled \u20ac17.8 billion, well above the internal target, enabling it to meet its 12-month commitments. It consisted of \u20ac14.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents and \u20ac3.3 billion in confirmed credit agreements, which remained unused on 31 December 2023.\n\nLiquidity risk management for the Sales Financing segment is based on several metrics or analyses, updated monthly on the  basis  of  the  latest  forecasts  of  outstanding  loans  and refinancing  transactions.  Laws  relating  to  the  outflow  of deposits  are  subject  to  conservative  assumptions.  The Group has limits governing its liquidity risk. Mobilize FS must always  have  sufficient  financial  resources  to  ensure  the long-term  future  of  its  business  and  development.  As  of 31  December  2023,  the  liquidity  reserve  of  th  e  Mobilize Financial Services group (Europe scope) stood at \u20ac14.6  billion,  significantly  above  the  internal  targets.  It comprises  \u20ac4.4  billion  in  undrawn  committed  credit  lines, \u20ac5.4  billion  in  collateral  eligible  for  central  bank  monetary policy  operations,  and  \u20ac4.6  billion  in  high-quality  liquid assets  (HQLA)  and  \u20ac0.2  billion  in  available  cash,  enabling Mobilize  FS  to  maintain  the  financing  granted  to  its customers  for  more  than  12  months  without  access  to external sources of liquidity.\n\nFor more details, see note 25-B1 to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Customer and network credit risk\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn its sales financing business , the Group is exposed to credit risk  from  private  and  corporate  customers  and  the  dealer network.  Credit  risk  arises  from  the  uncertainty  that  the customer (debtor) may not be able to meet the repayment obligations on the debt with Mobilize Financial Services.\n\nCredit  risk  can  thus  be  broken  down  into  default  risk (probability  of  a  customer's  failure  to  meet  repayment obligations) and loss given default (non-repayment of debt at  the  time  of  default).  The  assessment  of  these  two components of credit risk is linked to the socioeconomic and financial elements of the debtor and to the macroeconomic and microeconomic context in which the debtor is found.\n\nAs  such,  the  level  of  credit  risk  is  expressed  on  the classification  of  loans  according  to  their  level  of  risk (classification  in  three  stages  according  to  IFRS  9)  and  on the  level  of  impairment  applied  on  each  risk  class  (stage). Impairment  charges  on  loans  and  losses  are  recognised annually  and  presented  in  the  Mobilize  Financial  Services income  statement  in  the  'cost  of  risk'  accounting aggregate.  The  level  of  the  annual  cost  of  risk  thus expresses  the  marginal  increase  or  decrease  in  credit  risk on the customer loan portfolio.",

The quality of credit risk at the outset and throughout the life of the  loan  is  monitored  on  an  ongoing  basis,  and  specific governance has been put in place to ensure the consistency of the credit risk monitoring system. Within this framework, provision  adjustments  are  made  for  vulnerable  customer segments or factors that would worsen the risk, such as the inflation already observed.\n\nLastly,  in  a  forward-looking  management  approach,  Mobilize FS  makes upward adjustments to the amount of impairment on  its  outstanding  customer  loans  using  the  forward-looking technique,  which  takes  into  account  unfavourable  economic scenarios  and  measures  the  resilience  of  its  business  model and the level  of  equity  capital  by  applying  a  stress  test  to  its customer loan portfolio.\n\nThe  total  cost  of  risk  on  31  December  2023,  was  0.29%  of average  performing  assets,  compared  with  0.44%  on 31  December  2022.  On  31  December  2023,  net  customer assets  amounted to  \u20ac42,634  million,  and  net  dealer  assets totalled \u20ac11,592 million.\n\nFor  further  details  on  customer  and  dealer  network  credit  risk management,  see  note  25-B6  to  the  consolidated  financial statements.\n\n## Risk of exposure to residual values\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe downward trend in the second-hand vehicle market can entail  a  risk  for  the  holder  of  the  residual  values,  who  has committed to taking back the vehicle at the end of the lease at a price fixed when the contracts are put in place. This risk could have a negative impact on the company's operating results and financial position due to the recognition of losses not foreseen at the origin of the contract. 2023 was a year of stability for the second-hand market, with prices beginning to fall. The risk of a decline in residual values is borne by the Group's  automotive  activities  and  by  Mobilize  Financial Services  for  financing  associated  with  a  vehicle  buyback commitment.  On  31  December  2023,  Renault  Group's exposure totalled \u20ac2,893 million for the Automotive segment (net  book  value  of  vehicles)  and  \u20ac3,356  million  for  Mobilize FS. On  31  December  2022,  it  was  \u20ac2,816  million  and\n\n\u20ac2,506  million  for  Mobilize.  The  increase  in  exposure  is explained by the recovery in the commercial activity (better commercial  performance)  and  maintaining  the  residual values of vehicles.\n\n## Risk management\n\nDevelopments in  the  second-hand  market  are  periodically and  thoroughly  monitored  by  the  Renault  Group  Residual Value  Committee,  which  analyses,  among  other  things, volumes  of  used  vehicle  sales,  their  current  and  future market prices,  the  sales  channel  mix  and  the  sale  price  of new units of these vehicles. This results in a risk estimation, and  provisions  are  carefully  made  for  the  loan  portfolio when  the  observed  market  values  have  fallen  below  the level of the buyback commitments or if specific future risks have  been  identified  on  the  second-hand  vehicle  market. Mobilize  FS  has  equivalent  governance  and  benefits  from significant  synergies  with  the  parent  company  in  terms  of tools and information.\n\n## Interest rate risk\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nExposure  to  interest  rate  risk  relates  mainly  to  the  Sales Financing segment and represents the impact of a change in  interest  rates  on  future  financial  gross  margin.  Mobilize FS's  operating  income  may  be  affected  by  changes  in market interest rates or rates paid on customer deposits.\n\n## Risk management\n\nInterest  rate  risk  for  the  Sales  Financing  segment is managed  on  a  daily  basis:  sensitivity  is  calculated  by currency, by management entity and by asset portfolio, thus verifying  that  each  entity  respects  its  individual  imposed limits.  Sensitivity to interest rate risk is measured using the same  methodology  throughout  all  Mobilize  FS  entities. Sensitivity  is  a  measure  of  the  impact  of  an  increase  in interest rates on the value of balance sheet flows for each entity. The extent of the increase is determined by historical observation of rates in each currency. At 31 December 2023, the rate shocks applied for each currency were: +100 bps for EUR, CHF, DKK and MAD; +150 bps for SEK and GBP; +200 bps for CZK; +250 bps for HUF; +300 bps for RON, COP, PLN and BRL;  +350  bps  for  BRL;  +500  bps  for  ARS  and  RUB.  The hedging  system  enables  the  overall  exposure  of  Mobilize Financial  Services  to  be  reduced  as  well  as  that  of  each entity.  On  31  December  2023,  after  hedging,  the  absolute values for sensitivity to parallel interest rate shock in each currency totalled \u20ac10.9 million, which is below the limit set by the Group (\u20ac70 million).\n\nFor the Automotive segment , liquidity reserves are generally built  up  at  variable  rates,  and  long-term  investments  are financed at fixed rates. The Automotive segment's available cash is centralised, as much as possible, within Renault S.A. and  invested  in  the  form  of  short-term  bank  deposits  by Renault Finance.\n\nFor  further  details  on  interest  rate  risk  management,  see note 25-B3 to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nI",

        "page_content": "## 4.3 Litigation\n\n## 4.3.1 Legal disputes\n\nRenault Group is involved in various governmental, legal and arbitration proceedings as a normal part of its activities in France and abroad.\n\nTo  the  best  of  Renault  Group's  knowledge,  over  the  last 12 months there have been no disputes or governmental or legal proceedings  other  than  those  described  below,  or  any arbitration processes underway or likely to occur and that could have  a  significant  impact  on  its  financial  position,  activities  or results. Each event is reviewed regularly, in particular when the accounts  are  closed.  After  seeking  the  opinion  of  the appropriate  advisors,  the  Group  sets  aside  any  provisions deemed  necessary  to cover the estimated risks (see note 20 'Provisions' to the consolidated financial statements).\n\n## Proceedings on emissions\n\n## In France\n\nLike  several  other  manufacturers,  Renault  Group  has  been the  target  of  a  judicial  investigation  for  aggravated deception  since  2017.  This  case  follows  the  investigation conducted  by  the  DGCCRF  into  the  emission  of  nitrogen oxide  (NOx)  of  a  dozen  carmakers  selling  diesel  vehicles  in France. In this case, joined by fewer than 20 complainants, Renault  Group  was  charged  on  8  June  2021.  As  per  this status, the company is presumed innocent.\n\nRenault  Group  denies  having  committed  any  offence  and points out that its vehicles are not equipped with any rigging software for  pollution  control  devices.  The  company  takes all necessary measures to preserve its rights.\n\nAt  this  stage,  Renault  Group  has  had  to  post  a  bond  of \u20ac20  million  (\u20ac18  million  of  which  will  be  dedicated  to  the potential  payment  of  damages  and  fines)  and  provide  a \u20ac60  million  bank  guarantee  dedicated  to  the  potential compensation for losses.\n\n## International\n\nAlso,  on  the  matter  of  nitrogen  oxide  (NOx)  emissions, Renault  Group  has  been  the  target  of  civil  actions  for damages  in  various  countries  for  allegedly  equipping  its vehicles with rigging software for pollution control devices.\n\nIn Germany, 70 proceedings are in progress against Renault Group,  including  61  against  Renault  s.a.s  and  9  against Renault AG. Fifty-five first-instance decisions and 10 appeals court decisions have already been handed down. All but one of  the  rulings  were  in  favour  of  Renault  Group.  In  the decision in favour of the claimant, Renault was ordered on appeal  to  pay  the  claimant  \u20ac1,077  (plus  interest),  while  the claimant  was  ordered  to  pay  Renault  the  costs  of  the proceedings amounting to \u20ac17,000. This decision cannot be appealed.\n\nRisk and control\n\nIn  Austria,  10  civil  proceedings  are  underway.  Six  decisions were handed down, including one in favour of Renault Group. All these decisions have been appealed. Two final decisions were  handed  down  in  favour  of  the  appellants,  ordering Renault  Group  to  pay  them  \u20ac9,532.26  and  \u20ac31,946.53 respectively, including interest and defence costs.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, a class action originated by three law firms,  in  which  some  preliminary  procedural  steps  have been  initiated,  is  currently  being  brought  by  two  of  them (after  the  withdrawal  of  the  third)  against  Renault  S.A., Renault Retail Group UK Limited, RCI Bank S.A. and certain authorised  dealers.  Six  other  firms  have  since  informed Renault's  board  of  their  intention  to  join  the  petitions brought  by  these  two  firms.  An  initial  procedural  hearing took place on 17, 18 and 19 January 2024 and confirmed that the  action  against  Renault  would  take  the  form  of  a  class action ('Group Litigation Order').\n\nIn  Scotland,  a  class  action  was  brought  by  six  law  firms against Renault S.A., Renault Flins, Renault s.a.s., Renault UK Limited  and  RCI  Financial  Services  Limited.  An  initial procedural  hearing  to  rule  on  the  admissibility  of  the  call action will take place on 14 June 2024.\n\nLastly, three Dutch  foundations  have  initiated legal proceedings  against  Renault  S.A.,  Renault  S.A.S.,  Renault Nederland  NV,  Renault-Nissan  BV  and  Automobile  Dacia S.A. in the Netherlands, as well as certain authorised dealers. A  hearing  on  the  admissibility  of  the  foundations  and  the applicable  law  was  held  on  29  January  2024,  and  the Amsterdam  court  will  issue  an  interim  decision  on 10 April 2024.\n\nLastly,  a  class  action  is  also  in  progress  in  Israel  against Renault S.A. alongside its Israeli distributor. This proceeding is at a preliminary procedural stage. Renault S.A. has not yet formalised  any  pleadings  in  this  proceeding.  A  preliminary hearing will be held on 26 September 2024.\n\n## Antitrust investigations on end-of-life vehicles\n\nOn  15  March  2022,  the  European  Commission  conducted inspections  at  the  premises  of  companies  and  associations active  in  the  automotive  industry  located  in  several  EU Member States. At the same time, the European Commission sent out formal requests for information to several companies active in the industry. The investigation concerns possible anticompetitive collusion in relation to the collection, treatment  and  recovery  of  end-of-life  (ELV)  passenger  and commercial  vehicles,  relating  to, in particular, (i) the compensation  of  ELV  collection,  treatment  and  recovery companies, and (ii) the use of data relating to the recyclability or recoverability of ELVs in advertising materials.\n\nI\n\n04",

Renault Group is aiming to achieve in 2024:\n- -A Group operating margin \u22657.5%\n- -A free cash flow \u2265\u20ac2.5bn\n- \u25cf A significantly higher dividend of \u20ac1.85 will be proposed to the vote of the Annual General Meeting on May 16, 2024, versus \u20ac0.25 per share in respect of 2022 financial year (+\u20ac1.60 per share)\n\n## Commercial results\n\n## \u25cf 3 complementary and growing brands:\n\n- -Worldwide  Group 's  sales  up  9%  versus  2022  to  reach 2,235,000  units.  In  Europe 2 , sales  were  up  18.6%  in  a market up 13.9%.\n- -Renault is  the  best-selling  French  brand  in  the  world, 2 nd place in the European PC+LCV 3 market, leader in the European LCV 4 market, leading position in France in PC and LCV. Clio became the best-selling car in France in 2023, all sales channels combined and is #3 in Europe.\n- -Dacia ranked  11 th on  the  European  PC  +  LCV  market (+ 4 places). In the European PC market, Dacia joins the top  10.  The  brand  confirms  its  2 nd place  on  the  retail vehicle market in Europe 5 , its core market.\n- -Alpine sales were up 22.1% versus 2022. The Alpine A110 maintains its position as the leading two-seater sports coup\u00e9 sold in Europe in 2023.\n- \u25cf A  commercial  policy  focused  on  value  and  already benefitting  from  the  beginning  of  the  unprecedented product offensive:\n- -Renault brand sales in C-segment and above in  Europe improved  by  26%  compared  to  2022,  thanks  to  the success of Arkana, Austral, Espace E-TECH Hybrid and Megane  E-TECH  Electric. C & above segments represented 42% (+ 3 points vs 2022) of Renault brand sales mix in Europe in 2023.\n- -65%  of  Group  sales  were  on  the retail  channel in  the Group's  five  main  countries  in  Europe 6 . Renault  brand generated more than half of its sales in the retail channel.\n\n## \u25cf A successful electrification offensive:\n\n- -Renault  brand  took  the  3 rd place  in  Europe  for electrified 7 passenger  car  with  sales  up  19.7%  versus 2022. They accounted for 39.7% of the brand's PC sales in Europe (of which 11.3% EV). This trend was supported\n\nby a 62% increase in hybrid vehicle (HEV) sales. Austral, Clio  and  Captur  are  among  the  top  10  best-selling hybrid vehicles in Europe.\n\n- -Dacia already started its smooth electrification strategy: Dacia  Jogger  Hybrid  140,  on  sale  since  January  2023, represents  more  than  25%  of  Jogger  orders  and  Dacia Spring, 100% electric, held on to its place in the top-three European 4 retail electric vehicles sales 8 .\n- -In  2023,  Renault  Group  confirms  it  achieved  its  CAFE 9 targets (passenger cars and light commercial vehicles) in Europe.\n\n## Financial results\n\nThe  consolidated  financial  statements  of  Renault  Group  and the  company  accounts  of  Renault  SA  at  December  31,  2023 were approved by the Board of Directors on February 14, 2024 under the chairmanship of Jean-Dominique Senard.\n\nGroup revenue reached \u20ac52,376 million, up 13.1% compared to 2022. At constant exchange rates 10 , it increased by 17.9%.\n\nAutomotive revenue stood at \u20ac48,150 million, up 11.7% compared to 2022. It includes 4.8 points of negative exchange rates effect (\u20ac2,068 million) mainly related to the Argentinean peso and to a lesser  extent  to  the  Turkish  lira  devaluation.  At  constant exchange rates 10 , it increased by 16.5%.\n\n- \u25cf Volume  effect  stood  at  +4.0  points  thanks  to  the commercial  success  of  vehicles.  The  9%  increase  in registrations translates into 4 points of volume effect due to  the  lower  restocking  within  the  dealership  network compared to the end of 2022. This improvement on total inventories  is  better  than  our  objective  of  being  below 500,000 units at the end of the year.\n- \u25cf The price effect,  positive  by  +7.4  points,  continued  to  be very  strong  and  reflects  the  Group's  commercial  policy focused  on  value  over  volume,  vehicles  enrichment  as well as price increases to offset currency effect.\n- \u25cf The  geographic  mix  impacted  positively  by  +1.7  points thanks to the strong sales performance in Europe.\n- \u25cf The product mix effect stood at +1.0 point mainly thanks to  the  success  of  Austral,  Espace  E-TECH  Hybrid  and LCVs. The success of Clio had a negative impact on this item  as  its  average  selling  price  is  below  the  Group's average selling price.\n- \u25cf Sales  to  partners  had  a  positive  effect  of  2.1  points, supported  by  the  production  of  the  ASX  (since  the beginning of the year 2023) and Colt (since October 2023) for Mitsubishi Motors as well as a dynamic LCV business with Nissan, Renault Trucks and Mercedes-Benz.\n- 1 10 new vehicles launches in 2024 without Renault Duster (outside Europe) and Captur facelift.\n- 2 ACEA European Scope.\n- 3 PC+LCV: passenger car + light commercial vehicle.\n- 4 Excluding pickup trucks.\n- 5 Austria, Belgium, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom.\n- 6 France, Germany, Spain, Italy, United Kingdom.\n- 7 Includes EV, Hybrid (HEV) and Plug-In Hybrid (PHEV), excludes Mild-Hybrid (MHEV).\n- 8 Austria, Belgium, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom\n- 9 The official results will be released by the European Commission in the coming months.

It  continued  to improve sequentially from 6.3% in 2022 H2 to 7.6% in 2023 H1 and 8.1% in 2023 H2. It stood at \u20ac4,117 million, up \u20ac1,547 million versus 2022.\n\nGroup  operating  margin  includes,  since  the  beginning  of November  2022  and  until  the  deconsolidation  of  Horse,  a positive non-cash effect of the cessation of amortization for these  assets  held  for  sale.  It  accounted  for  \u20ac482  million  in 2023  (\u20ac275  million  in  2023  H1  and  \u20ac207  million  in  2023  H2). Year -on -year, it represented a positive effect of \u20ac398 million.\n\nAdjusted  from  this  positive  impact,  the  Group  operating margin would have been 6.9% in 2023 with 6.6% in 2023 H1 and 7.3% in 2023 H2.\n\nAutomotive operating margin also reached a record level at 6.3%  of  Automotive  revenue  in  2023,  up  3.0  points  versus 2022.  It  stood  at a  record  \u20ac3,051  million  in  2023  versus \u20ac1,402 million in 2022.\n\n- \u25cf Automotive operating margin was strongly impacted by a negative  forex  of  -\u20ac595  million  mainly  due  to  the Argentinean peso.\n- \u25cf The positive volume effect at +\u20ac621 million and the positive mix/price/enrichment  effect  of  +\u20ac2,908  million  illustrated the  success  of  vehicles  and  of  the  commercial  policy focused on value. The positive mix/price/enrichment effect more  than  compensated  the  increase  in  costs.  This increase  amounted  to  -\u20ac1,630  million  and  is  mainly explained by the impact of the carry-over of raw materials and energy price increases, logistics and labor costs.\n- \u25cf SG&A  increased  by  \u20ac389  million,  mainly  driven  by marketing costs due the ongoing product offensive and salary increases.\n- \u25cf The  price  reevaluations  in  Argentina,  computed  in  the Renault Group's subscription plan in the country, explained most of the +\u20ac376 million effect in the 'others' item.\n\nThe  contribution  of Mobilize  Financial  Services (Sales Financing)  to  the  Group's  operating  margin  reached \u20ac1,101  million  versus  \u20ac1,198  million  in  2022 11 due  to  nonrecurring  impacts  of  the  swaps  valuation  linked  to  the interest  rate  increase  in  Europe  since  beginning  2022. Excluding  this  one-off,  Mobilize  Financial  Services  would have posted an operating margin up 8% compared to 2022. This  evolution  was  mainly  driven  by  the  increase  in  new financings and lower cost of risk.\n\nOther  operating  income  and  expenses were  negative  at -\u20ac1,632  million  (versus  -\u20ac379  million  in  2022).  This  amount  was mainly driven by -\u20ac0.9 billion of capital loss on the disposal of Nissan  shares  made  in  December  2023,  -\u20ac0.5  billion  of impairment on vehicles developments and specific production assets  and  by  restructuring  costs.  Capital  gain  on  asset disposals amounted to +\u20ac0.3 billion, related to the sale of land in  Boulogne-Billancourt, of several commercial subsidiaries of the Group and of branches of Renault Retail Group.\n\nAfter  taking  into  account  other  operating  income  and expenses, the Group's operating income stood at \u20ac2,485  million  versus  \u20ac2,191  million  in  2022  (+\u20ac294  million versus 2022).\n\nNet financial income and expenses amounted to -\u20ac527 million compared to -\u20ac486 million in 2022. The increase is explained by the impact of hyperinflation in Argentina partially offset by the positive impact of the rise in interest rates on the net cash position.\n\nThe contribution  of  associated  companies amounted  to \u20ac880 million compared to \u20ac423 million in 2022. This included \u20ac797 million related to Nissan's contribution.\n\nCurrent  and  deferred  taxes represented  a  charge  of -\u20ac523  million,  stable  compared  to  2022  (-\u20ac524  million  in 2022).  The  increase  in  the  pre-tax  income,  related  to  the improvement in performance was offset by the evolution of deferred taxes.\n\nThus, net  income stood  at  \u20ac2,315  million,  up  \u20ac3,031  million compared  to  2022  and net  income,  Group  share, was \u20ac2,198 million (or \u20ac8.11 per share). As a reminder, in 2022, net income from discontinued operations amounted to -\u20ac2,320  million  due  to  the  non-cash  adjustment  related  to the disposals of the Russian industrial activities.\n\nThe cash  flow of  the  Automotive  business was  at  record level  in  2023  and  reached  \u20ac5,485  million,  up  \u20ac667  million versus  2022.  It  includes  \u20ac600  million  of  Mobilize  Financial Services dividend versus \u20ac800 million in 2022. This cash flow significantly more than covered the tangible and intangible investments  before  asset  disposals  which  amounted  to \u20ac2.9 billion (\u20ac2.6 billion net of disposals) and the restructuring expenses (\u20ac0.5 billion).\n\nExcluding  the  impact  of  asset  disposals,  the  Group's  net CAPEX and R&D stood at \u20ac3,817 million in 2023, representing 7.3%  of  revenue  compared  to  7.4%  of  revenue  in  2022.  It amounted to 6.7% including asset disposals.\n\nFree  cash  flow 12 reached  a record  level at  \u20ac3,024  million. Excluding  Mobilize  Financial  Services  dividend,  it  stood  at \u20ac2,424 million versus \u20ac1,319 million in 2022, up \u20ac1,105 million. The change in working capital requirement was positive at \u20ac637  million  and  is  mainly  related  to  the  decrease in inventories.\n\nAs  of  December  31,  2023, total  inventories of  new  vehicles (including  the  independent  dealer  network)  represented 484,000 vehicles,  better  than  our  objective,  and  compared to 569,000  vehicles  at  the  end  of  June  2023  and 480,000 vehicles at the end of December 2022.\n\nThe Automotive net financial position stood at \u20ac3,724 million on  December  31,  2023  compared  to  \u20ac549  million  on December 31, 2022, an improvement of \u20ac3,175 million.\n\nIn 2023, it included the following operations:\n\n- \u25cf \u20ac764 million corresponding to the sale of 211,000,000 Nissan  shares  held  in  a  French  trust, implemented as per new Alliance Agreement;",

Among  them,  nearly  38,000  also  subscribed  to shares  at  a  preferential  price  of  26.28  euros  per  share.  In total,  with  nearly  2.1  million  additional  shares  held  by employees,  this  second  Renaulution  Shareplan  operation represented 0.7% of Renault Group's capital.\n\nEmployees hold 5.07% of the capital at december 31, 2023.\n\n## Dividend\n\nThe  proposed  dividend  for  the  financial  year  2023  is \u20ac1.85  per  share,  up  \u20ac1.60 per  share  versus  last  year. The payout ratio is 17.5% of Group consolidated net income parent  share 13 .

Clio  is  now  #3  in  Europe  with more than 219,365 units sold.\n\nRenault is also a true European leader in Light Commercial Vehicles 20 with  a  25.7%  growth, in  a  market  up  15.3%. Kangoo/Express  (+32.4%)  and  Master  (+14.5%)  are  the leaders in their segments.\n\nCommercial policy focused on value combined with market share gains\n\nIn line with its value-oriented strategy, Renault is accelerating  its  offensive  on  the C  segment  and  above (+26%) in Europe.\n\n- \u25cf In the C-segment and above in Europe ,  the Renault brand recorded a 26% sales growth compared with 2022, thanks to  the  success  of  Arkana,  Austral,  Espace  E-Tech  Hybrid and the Megane E-Tech electric.\n- \u25cf The mix and sales channels are virtuous :  in  its  five  main countries  in  Europe,  the  Renault  brand  generates  more than  half  its  sales  in  the  value-creating  market  of  retail customers. In addition, top-of-the-range versions such as \"Esprit Alpine\" are appreciated by customers. 51% of the Austral and 44% of the Espace E-Tech Hybrid sales are in the Esprit Alpine version.\n\n## Electrification: a winning strategy in Europe\n\nRenault  is  continuing  its  electrification  offensive (hybrid  and all-electric  vehicles).  The  strong  technological  choices  made by the brand are proving to be relevant, in line with customer expectations:  an all-electric  portfolio on  the  one  hand  and a hybrid  portfolio on  the  other,  for  a  more  progressive  energy transition. Renault has thus accelerated its growth, with a 19.7% increase  in  sales  in  one  year  (270,362  vehicles  sold)  and  took the 3 rd place  in  Europe for  electrified  passenger  cars.  Sales volume  of  electrified  vehicles  now  account  for  39.7%  of  the brand's passenger car sales.\n\nThis trend was supported by a 62% increase in hybrid vehicle (HEV) sales, 185,666 units in total .  Austral , Clio and Captur are among the top 10 best-selling hybrid vehicles in Europe.\n\nMegane E-TECH electric, launched mid-2022, is the vehicle that  has  repositioned  the  brand  in  the  all-electric  market and helped it win over new customers (conquest rate over the competition of more than 50% in Europe). 47,504 units of Megane E-TECH electric have been sold in 2023 and places itself within the top 3 of the sales of its category in Europe.\n\nThe  Renault  brand's  all-electric  portfolio  will  be  expanded  in 2024 with Scenic E-TECH electric and Renault 5 E -TECH electric.\n\n## 2024:  a  historic  year  in  commercial  launches  for  the Renault brand\n\n2024 will be a historic year with 7 21 new vehicles launches:\n\n- \u25cf 2  new  all-electric  vehicles  with  Scenic  E-TECH  electric, offering more than 600 km of WLTP range, and Renault 5 E- TECH electric - all-electric pop icon;\n- 20 Excluding pickup trucks.\n- 21 7 new vehicles launches for Renault Brand in 2024 without Renault Duster (outside Europe) and Captur facelift.\n- 22 Austria, Belgium, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom.\n\nI\n\n- \u25cf 2 new hybrid vehicles in Europe, including Rafale E-TECH, New Renault Master (ICE and all-electric versions);\n- \u25cf 2 new vehicles in markets outside Europe: Kardian and a Renault Korea Motors vehicle. In 2024, the Renault brand will  continue  to  roll  out  the \"International  Game  Plan 2027\" .  After  Brazil  and  Turkey  in  2023,  this  year  will  be highlighted by the deployment of the plan in Morocco and South Korea.\n\n## Dacia brand\n\n## Growing success in Europe\n\nIn  Europe, Dacia sold  562,890  units.  The  brand  enjoys growing success and registers a  17.4%  growth in a market up 13.9%. Dacia has moved up 4 places and is now ranked 11 th on the European PC + LCV market. In the PC market, Dacia joins the top 10 in Europe.\n\nThis  result  is driven  by  its  new  strong  brand  identity  of \"essential,  cool,  robust,  affordable,  and  environmentally friendly  vehicles\" structured  around 4  pillar  models, all  of which are growing compared to 2022.\n\n## Record market shares of the brand in Europe\n\nThis  performance  enabled  Dacia  to  achieve  a record market share .\n\n- \u25cf 3.8% (+0.1 pt vs. 2022) in PC + LCV;\n- \u25cf 4.3% (+0.1 pt vs. 2022) in PC;\n- \u25cf 8.3%  (+0.7  pts)  in  PC  for  retail  customers.

It includes 4.8 points of negative exchange rates effect (\u20ac2,068 million) mainly related to the Argentinean peso  and  to  a  lesser  extent  to  the  Turkish  lira  devaluation. At constant exchange rates 5 , it increased by 16.5%.\n\n- \u25cf Volume  effect  stood  at  +4.0  points  thanks  to  the commercial  success  of  vehicles.  The  9%  increase  in registrations translates into 4 points of volume effect due to  the  lower  restocking  within  the  dealership  network compared to the end of 2022.

It  continued  to improve sequentially from 6.3% in 2022 H2 to 7.6% in 2023 H1 and 8.1% in 2023 H2. It stood at \u20ac4,117 million, up \u20ac1,547 million versus 2022.\n\nGroup  operating  margin  includes,  since  the  beginning  of November  2022  and  until  the  deconsolidation  of  Horse,  a positive non-cash effect of the cessation of amortization for these  assets  held  for  sale.  It  accounted  for  \u20ac482  million  in 2023  (\u20ac275  million  in  2023  H1  and  \u20ac207  million  in  2023  H2). Year-on-year, it represented a positive effect of \u20ac398 million.\n\nAdjusted  from  this  positive  impact,  the  Group  operating margin would have been 6.9% in 2023 with 6.6% in 2023 H1 and 7.3% in 2023 H2.\n\nAutomotive operating margin also reached a record level at 6.3%  of  Automotive  revenue  in  2023,  up  3.0  points  versus 2022.

The positive mix/price/ enrichment effect more than compensated the increase in costs. This increase amounted to -\u20ac1,630 million and is mainly explained by the impact of the carry-over of raw materials  and  energy  price  increases,  logistics  and labor costs.\n\n- \u25cf SG&A  increased  by  \u20ac389  million,  mainly  driven  by marketing costs due the ongoing product offensive and salary increases.\n- \u25cf The  price  reevaluations  in  Argentina,  computed  in  the Renault Group's subscription plan in the country, explained most of the +\u20ac376 million effect in the 'others' item.\n\nThe  contribution  of Mobilize  Financial  Services (Sales Financing)  to  the  Group's  operating  margin  reached \u20ac1,101  million  versus  \u20ac1,198  million  in  2022 24 due  to  nonrecurring  impacts  of  the  swaps  valuation  linked  to  the interest  rate  increase  in  Europe  since  beginning  2022. Excluding  this  one-off,  Mobilize  Financial  Services  would have posted an operating margin up 8% compared to 2022. This  evolution  was  mainly  driven  by  the  increase  in  new financings and lower cost of risk.\n\n- \u25cf The  positive  volume  effect  at  +\u20ac621  million  and  the positive  mix/price/enrichment  effect  of  +\u20ac2,908  million",

Nissan's accounts used to prepare Renault's financial statements are Nissan's consolidated  accounts  published  in  compliance  with  Japanese  accounting  standards,  adjusted  according  to  IFRS  standards  for consolidation  purposes.  In  accordance  with  the  approach  described  in  the  accounting  rules  and  methods  (notes  2-M  and  12-G),  an impairment test of the investment in Nissan was carried out on December 31, 2023.\n\nWe have considered that the consolidation method and recoverable value of the equity investment in Nissan is a key audit matter given its magnitude to Renault's consolidated financial statements, and given the following areas of attention: (1) the judgment of management to assess the Alliance governance structure as well as facts and circumstances underlying Renault's significant influence over Nissan, (2) the completeness and accuracy of adjustments to Nissan's financial statements required to account for Renault's share in the result and equity  of  this  company  and  their  accuracy,  (3)  the  estimates  used  by  management  in  determining  the  recoverable  value  of  Renault's investment in Nissan.\n\nThe Group carries out impairment tests on assets as soon as an impairment risk indicator has been identified, and at least once a year for assets with infinite useful life, under the approach described in note 2-M of the consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe test consists in comparing the net book value of assets with their recoverable value, defined as the higher amount between the value in use and the fair value net of exit costs. The value in use is calculated based on discounted future cash flows. When the recoverable amount is less than the net book value, the impairment loss is recognized as a reduction in the assets concerned.\n\nAt  2023  year-end  closing,  these  impairment  tests  consider  the  assumptions  used  in  the  medium-term  plan  for  the  period  2024-2027 announced in January 2021, updated at the end of 2023 and presented to the Leadership Team.\n\nIn addition, the perpetuity growth rates used in the tests as of December 31, 2023, take into account the impacts of the commitments made by the signatory States of the Paris agreements on climate change.\n\nWe have considered that the valuation of assets is a key audit matter because of their significance to the financial statements and because of the estimates and judgments required from Management to prepare these tests, particularly in the current context described above.\n\nFinancial statements\n\n05",

RCI Banque applies the accounting principles of IFRS 9 \"Financial Instruments\" which defines a provisioning model for expected losses based on three stages of risk: healthy receivables (stage 1), receivables showing higher credit risk since initial recognition (stage 2), and receivables in default (stage 3).\n\nThe  provisions  related  to  IFRS  9  are  detailed  in  Note  15  of  the  consolidated  financial  statements  and  amounts  to  1  126  million  euros  on December 31, 2023, for an outstanding amount of 50 741 million euros.\n\nWe consider the amount of credit loss provisioning as a key audit matter, due to the significant amount of customer and network loans in the assets of the Group's balance sheet, the use of numerous parameters and assumptions in the calculation models and the use of judgment made by management in estimating expected credit losses. As mentioned in the note 2-B of the financial statements, the methods used to estimate impairment expenses consider the contrasting macro-economic context, reflected in the slowdown in inflation and the return of volatility to financial markets.",

Our objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.\n\nAs  specified  in  Article  L.  821-55  of  the  French  Commercial  Code  (Code  de  commerce),  our  statutory  audit  does  not  include assurance on the viability of the Company or the quality of management of the affairs of the Company.\n\nAs part of an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, the statutory auditor exercises professional judgment throughout the audit and furthermore:\n\n- \u25cf Identifies and assesses the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error,  designs  and  performs  audit  procedures  responsive  to  those  risks,  and  obtains  audit  evidence  considered  to  be sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for his opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud  is  higher  than  for  one  resulting  from  error,  as  fraud  may  involve  collusion,  forgery,  intentional  omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control;\n- \u25cf Obtains an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the internal control;\n- \u25cf Evaluates the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management in the consolidated financial statements;\n- \u25cf Assesses  the  appropriateness  of  management's  use  of  the  going  concern  basis  of  accounting  and,  based  on  the  audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. This assessment is based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date  of  his  audit  report.  However,  future  events  or  conditions  may  cause  the  Company  to  cease  to  continue  as  a  going concern. If the statutory auditor concludes that a material uncertainty exists, there is a requirement to draw attention in the audit report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are not provided or inadequate, to modify the opinion expressed therein;\n- \u25cf Evaluates  the  overall  presentation  of  the  consolidated  financial  statements  and  assesses  whether  these  statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation;\n\nI\n\n05",

Changes in the financial statements resulting from first application of IFRS 17 - Insurance Contracts\n\nIFRS 17 - Insurance Contracts, published on May 18, 2017 and modified  by  amendments  of  June  25,  2020,  sets  out  the principles  of  recognition,  measurement,  presentation  and disclosures for insurance contracts. This standard replaces IFRS  4  -  Insurance  Contracts  and  became  applicable  on January  1,  2023.  The  Sales  Financing  segment  had  already applied IFRS 9 since January 1, 2018, having decided not use the exemption option.\n\n## Impacts for classification and measurement\n\nFor the Group, IFRS 17 mainly applies to insurance contracts issued  and  reinsurance  agreements  signed  by  the  Sales Financing segment's insurance companies.\n\nContracts  are  now  valued  in  groups  (known  as  'cohorts') under the general 'building block' approach  which comprises:  (1)  estimates  of  discounted  future  cash  flows weighted by the probability of occurrence, (2) an adjustment for  non-financial  risks,  and  (3)  the  contractual  service margin. The contractual service margin is recognized in the income  statement  based  on  the  coverage  units  provided during the period.\n\n## Impacts of the transition\n\nAs the Group considered it was not feasible to collect all the historical  data  required  to  estimate  the  value  of  the contracts in the portfolio at the transition date, it chose to use  the  simplified  retrospective  approach  to  record  the impact  of  the  transition  on  the  financial  statements  at January 1, 2022.\n\nUnder  this  approach,  for  each  annual  cohort  with  active contracts at the transition date, the contractual service margin is defined by the estimated future cash flows discounted to the subscription  date,  including  historical  cash  flows  prior  to January 1, 2022, with adjustment for non-financial risk.\n\nThe  transition  has  a  positive  impact  of  \u20ac167  million  on shareholders'  equity  in  the  opening  balance  sheet  at January 1, 2022. This positive impact on equity arises from a faster  recognition  of  profits  under  IFRS  17,  linked  to  the profile  of  hedging  units  that  reflect,  over  the  duration  of insurance  contracts,  the  decrease  in  amounts  at  risk corresponding  to  the  evolution  of  underlying  financial balances.  Under  IFRS  4,  insurance  premiums  are  acquired according to a linear profile.\n\nIn accordance with IFRS 17, the comparative figures for 2022 have been restated to take account of the application of the standard  as  of  January  1,  2022.  The  IFRS  17  technical provisions  at  January  1,  2022  and  December  31,  2022  have been  determined  by  applying  the  general  model  to  the portfolio existing at these dates.\n\nAt December 31, 2023 after application of IFRS 17, provisions covering  the  insurance  activities  of  the  Sales  Financing segment  represented  an  amount  of  \u20ac182  million  in provisions. Assets related to reinsurance contracts held for these same activities represent an amount of \u20ac25 million in other non-current assets.\n\nThe  impacts  of  application  of  IFRS  17  on  the  Group's consolidated financial position at the transition date and at December 31, 2022 are detailed in the table below:\n\n| (\u20ac million)                            | December 31, 2021 published   | January 01, 2022 restated   | Variation   | December 31, 2022 published   | December 31, 2022 restated   | Variation   |\n|----------------------------------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------|-------------|-------------------------------|------------------------------|-------------|\n| Assets / Other non-current assets      | 966                           | 920                         | (46)        | 938                           | 911                          | (27)        |\n| Liabilities / Provisions               | 1,291                         | 988                         | (303)       | 1,341                         | 1,082                        | (259)       |\n| Liabilities / Deferred tax liabilities | 1,009                         | 1,099                       | 90          | 1,021                         | 1,102                        | 81          |\n| Shareholders' equity / Reserves        | 25,159                        | 25,326                      | 167         | 26,370                        | 26,537                       | 167         |\n| Shareholders' equity.

Estimates and judgments\n\n## Specific context of 2023\n\n## Worldwide economic context\n\nAfter  several  consecutive  years  of  a  challenging  global business environment (marked by the electronic components  supply  crisis,  lower  distribution  capacities  in the logistics sector, and rising commodity prices) reflected in decreases in the Automotive segment's sales volumes of 4.5%  in  2021  and  5.9%  in  2022,  the  Group  returned  to  sales volume  growth  in  2023, registering a +9%  rise to 2,235,345 vehicles sold worldwide.\n\n## Changes in the Group's organization\n\nSince announcing its Renaulution plan in 2020, Renault Group has  worked  to  transform  its  business  and  its  organization. At  the  Capital  Market  Day  held  on  November  8,  2022,  it announced  that  some  of  its  Horse  project  powertrain technologies  were  to  be  combined  into  a  joint  venture.  The groups  of  assets  and  liabilities  concerned  were  therefore reclassified  as  assets  and  liabilities  held  for  sale  in  the consolidated financial position at December 31, 2022, and 2023 in accordance with IFRS 5. The scope of Horse was defined on July  1,  2023,  when  Renault  sas  transferred  its  intellectual property  rights  to  developments,  and  the  shares  of  the production subsidiaries, to Horse Holding (Note 3).\n\nThe Group also announced at the same Capital Market Day that  it  was  setting  up  five  targeted  businesses  with specialist teams, each one founded on a homogeneous set of  technologies  with  its  own  governance  and  results.  The entities included in the scope of Ampere were structured in late  2023  when  Renault  sas  transferred  an  autonomous branch of business to Ampere Holding sas (Note 3).\n\nThese  changes  have  no  impact  on  the  information  by operating segment presented for 2023.\n\n## New foundations for the partnership with Nissan\n\nOn November 8, 2023, the New Alliance Agreement between Renault  Group  and  Nissan  took  effect.  Consequently, Renault  transferred  28.4%  of  Nissan  shares  (from  its  total 43.4% stake)  into  a  French  trust,  in  which  the  voting  rights will be exercised neutrally, subject to certain exceptions. The voting  rights  of  Renault  Group  and  Nissan  are  capped  at 15%  of  the  exercisable  voting  rights,  and  both  companies are able to freely exercise their voting rights within that limit.\n\nOn December 13, 2023, Renault SA instructed the trust to sell Nissan 211 million of its own shares at the price of \u20ac3.62 per share, giving a total of \u20ac764 million. As Nissan has cancelled these  shares,  Renault's  percentage  interest  in  Nissan  is now 40.6%.\n\nIn early 2023 Renault Group and Nissan announced the new foundations  of  their  partnership,  including  operational projects, investment by Nissan in Ampere, the pure player in electric  vehicles  and  software  set  up  by  Renault  Group,  as well as the rebalancing of their cross-shareholdings at 15% and the transfer of a 28.4% share of Nissan held by Renault Group to a French trust in which the Group's voting rights are\n\n'neutralized' for most decisions, but it retains full benefit of its economic rights (to dividends and the proceeds of share sales) until the shares are sold. These new foundations of the partnership  agreement  with  Nissan  had  no  impact  on  the financial  statements  at  December  31,  2023.  The  changes were in progress at December 31, 2023.\n\n## Renault Group's exit from the Russian Federation\n\nIn  May  2022,  Renault  Group  sold  its  investments  in  Renault Russia and the AVTOVAZ Group.\n\nIn  March  2023,  the  Sales  Financing  segment  sold  its  30% investment in RN Bank, which was accounted for under the equity  method,  and  in  August  2023  it  sold  the  shares  of  its fully-owned subsidiary RN Leasing (Note 3).\n\nAt  December  31,  2023,  the  Group  no  longer  holds  any investments in the Russian Federation.\n\n## External financing\n\nAs the Group had sufficient liquidities, the Automotive segment did  not  issue  any  bonds  during  2023,  and  fully  repaid  the outstanding \u20ac990 million of its State-guaranteed credit facility during  the  year.  The  Sales  Financing  segment  undertook several  bond  issues  totalling  \u20ac3.9  billion  (Note  23-C)  in  2023, including a \u20ac750 million green bond.\n\nAt  the  date  of  publication  of  these  consolidated  financial statements,  the  Group  has  sufficient  cash  and  sources  of financing to ensure continuity of operations for the next twelve months, and has demonstrated its capacity to issue debt.\n\n## Sustainable development and climate considerations\n\nSustainable development considerations are a key component of Renault Group's strategy. Through the Paris Agreements  and  the  European  Green  Deal,  the  Group  has made  concrete  commitments  to  reach  carbon  neutrality and reduce emissions.\n\nThe Renaulution strategic plan unveiled by Renault Group in January 2021 plots out an ambitious roadmap  for transformation  and  kick-started  a  shift  from  volume  to value. November 2022 saw the start of the third chapter of this  plan,  called  Revolution.  The  autonomous  company Ampere, a pure player in electric vehicles and software set up in November 2023, creates the right conditions to make the Renault brand fully electric in Europe by 2030, and will be a major contribution to achieving Renault Group's net-zero objective  for  Europe  by  2040  and  worldwide  by  2050.  In Korea, following the launch of its own hybrid vehicle range in 2024, Renault Korea Motors (RKM) announced the forthcoming production and export from 2025 of the 100% electric  car  Polestar  4.  Finally,  Renault  Group,  Volvo  Group and CMA CGM are joining forces to meet the growing need for  decarbonized  logistics  with  a  new  generation  of  fully electric  vans.  Renault  Group  and  Volvo  Group  have  signed binding  agreements  to  form  a  new  company  based  in France,  initially  owned  in  equal  shares,  and  will  invest \u20ac300 million each over the next three years. CMA CGM has signed  a  non-binding  letter  of  intent  to  join  the  new company, investing \u20ac120 million.",

The changes introduced by the  Euro  7  standards  to  reduce  pollutant  emissions  from passenger cars and light commercial vehicles by 2030 have already  been  incorporated  into  the  plan.  The  principal sensitivity of the 2024-2032 medium-term plan concerns the transition risks of the Paris Agreements' baseline scenario. The Group takes great care to ensure that the compliance investments  necessary  for  its  products  and  production facilities are measured and included in the plan.\n\nFor  impairment  testing  of  vehicle-specific  assets,  the Group's  forecasts  take  account  of  profits  generated  by electric vehicles under the European Union's CAFE (Corporate  Average  Fuel  Economy)  regulation,  which  fines automakers  if  they  exceed  the  average  threshold  for  CO2 emissions,  and  the  negative  contributions  of  combustionfuel vehicles. The estimates are based on internal prices for each year a CAFE penalty is payable.\n\nThe  Group  assesses  the  depreciation  periods  for  fixed assets  at  the  end  of  each  accounting  period,  taking  into consideration  regulatory  changes  such  as  the  EU  ban  on sales of new petrol and diesel vehicles from 2035.\n\nThe  Group  is  also  securing  its  procurement  along  the electric vehicle value chain through long-term contracts for purchase volumes of raw materials, which are included in its off-balance sheet commitments (Note 28-A). These commitments  are  valued  at  year-end  spot  prices,  and minimum  payments  are  defined  by  reference  to  the  exit clauses contained in the contracts.\n\nThe  Group  contractualises  green  energy  purchases  that sometimes require investments at its production sites. The contract  terms  are  analyzed  to  define  which  party  has control of the assets. Some of these contracts are treated as leases, with recognition of a right-of-use asset. For the rest, the amounts  for  which  the  Group  has  given  firm commitments are reported in off-balance sheet commitments (Note 28-A).\n\nEuropean and foreign regulations have penalty and/or bonus mechanisms based on achievement of CO2 emissions targets by  vehicles  sold.  Emission  levels  have  to  be  estimated  at  the end  of  each  accounting  period,  but  the  final  figures  may  be calculated over several years under carry-back/carry-forward systems (as in South Korea) or only confirmed one or two years later  (as  in  the  European  system).  The  Group  has  set  up  a Committee to identify the relevant CO2 emissions and estimate the  corresponding  income  and  expenses,  and  estimates  are reviewed quarterly.\n\n## Principal estimates and judgments in the 2023 context\n\nThe  following  items  in  the  Group's  consolidated  financial statements have been paid particular attention in 2023:\n\n- \u25cf potential impairment of fixed assets, particularly impairment  on  specific  assets  linked  to  vehicles  and goodwill (Note 11);\n- \u25cf the  recoverable  value  of  leased  vehicles  classified  as property, plant and equipment or inventories;\n- \u25cf investments in associates, notably Nissan (Note 12);\n- \u25cf impairment for expected credit losses concerning Sales Financing receivables (Note 15);\n- \u25cf revenue recognition;\n- \u25cf determination of restructuring provisions (Notes 6-A and 20);\n- \u25cf determination of risks associated with distressed suppliers;\n- \u25cf determination  of  compliance  with  the  requirements  of IFRS  5  for  reclassification  of  assets  or  groups  of  assets and liabilities held for sale and reporting them on specific lines  in  the  balance  sheet  in  the  current  assets  and current liabilities (Note 3-C);\n\n## Other important estimates and judgments\n\nRenault  Group  often  has  to  make  estimates  and  assumptions that  affect  the  book  value  of  certain  assets  and  liabilities, income and expenses, and disclosures made in certain notes to the  financial  statements.  In  preparing  its  financial  statements, Renault  Group  revises  its  estimates  and  assessments  to  take account of past experience and other factors deemed relevant in view of the economic circumstances.\n\nIt takes into consideration forecast technological and market developments (commodity costs, changing customer demand, etc) and any other developments that could have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements, the  figures  reported  in  Renault  Group's  future  consolidated financial statements  could  differ from  the  estimates established  at  the  time  these  financial  statements  were finalised. The  main  items  in  the  Group's  consolidated financial statements  at  December  31,  2023  that  are dependent on estimates and judgments are the following:\n\n- \u25cf capitalization  of  research  and  development  expenses and their amortization period (Note 10-A);\n- \u25cf the  depreciation  and  amortization  periods  for  fixed assets  other  than  capitalized  development  expenses (Note 10);\n- \u25cf recognition of deferred tax assets on tax loss carryforwards (Note 8);\n- \u25cf provisions,  particularly  warranty  provisions  on  vehicles and batteries sold (Note 20), provisions for pensions and other  long-term  employee  benefit  obligations  (Note  19), provisions for workforce adjustment measures (Note 6-A), provisions for legal risks and tax risks (other than income tax risks and provisions for uncertain tax liabilities);\n- \u25cf valuation  of  lease  liabilities,  particularly  the  incremental borrowing  rates  and  the  value  of  renewal  and  termination options that are reasonably certain to be exercised (Note 23).\n\nI",

Consolidation principles\n\nThe consolidated financial statements include the financial statements  of  all  companies  controlled  exclusively  by  the Group  either  directly  or  indirectly  (subsidiaries).  Jointly controlled  companies  are  accounted  for  under  the  equity method  when  they  are  classified  as  joint  ventures  and consolidated on the basis of the percentage share specific to  each  balance  sheet  and  income  statement  item  when they are classified as joint operations.\n\nCompanies  in  which  the  Group  exercises  significant influence (associates) are included in the financial statements on an equity basis.\n\nSignificant intercompany  transactions  and  unrealized internal profits are eliminated.\n\nPut  options  on  non-controlling  interests  are  carried  in  the consolidated financial position at fair value, and classified in other financial liabilities  in  the  Automotive  segment and in other non-current liabilities in the Sales Financing segment, with a corresponding adjustment to equity.\n\nOutstanding  price  supplements  payable  to  shareholders who  have  sold  shares  to  the  Group  are  recorded  in  the financial  position,  in  financial  liabilities  (Automotive  and Mobilities  segments)  or  in  other  liabilities  (Sales  Financing segment) to give a better estimation of the obligation. The liability  is  initially  recognized via an adjustment to goodwill (or unconsolidated investments) and subsequently via profit and loss (other financial income and expenses, or the share in net income of associates and joint ventures, depending on the nature of the investment).\n\n## 2-D. Presentation of the consolidated financial statements\n\n## Valuation basis\n\nThe consolidated financial statements are established under the historical cost convention, except for certain categories of assets  and  liabilities,  in  compliance  with  IFRS  rules.  The categories concerned are detailed in the following notes.\n\n## Operating income and operating margin\n\nOperating  income  includes  all  revenues  and  costs  directly related  to  the  Group's  activities,  whether  recurrent  or resulting  from  non-recurring  decisions  or  operations,  such as restructuring costs.\n\nThe operating margin, which corresponds to the operating income  of  an  individual  segment  as  defined  in  IFRS  8, Operating Segments, corresponds to the operating income before other operating income and expenses, which are by nature unusual or significant and could affect comparability of the margin. Other operating income and expenses cover:\n\n- \u25cf restructuring  and  workforce  adjustment  costs,  and significant  costs  relating  to  discontinued  activities. A  restructuring  is  a  programme  that  is  planned  and controlled  by  management,  and  materially  changes either: a) the scope of a business undertaken by an entity; or b) the manner in which that business is conducted. The estimated cost of workforce adjustment measures, which for  accounting  purposes  is  treated  as  an  employee benefit,  is  covered  by  a  provision  over  the  estimated residual employment period of the employees concerned. The cost of termination indemnities is recognized as soon as  a  detailed  plan  has  either  been  announced  or  is  in progress.  The  amount  recorded  is  net  of  existing provisions for pensions;\n- \u25cf gains or losses on partial or total disposal of businesses or operating  entities,  gains  or  losses  on  total  or  partial disposals of investments in associates and joint ventures, other gains and losses relating to changes in the scope of consolidation,  and  direct  acquisition  costs  for  entities\n\nthat  are  fully  consolidated  or  consolidated  on  a  line-byline percentage of interest basis;\n\n- \u25cf gains or losses on disposal of property, plant and equipment or intangible assets (except leased assets sales);\n- \u25cf impairment  on  property,  plant and  equipment  or intangible  assets  and  goodwill  (excluding  goodwill  of associates or joint ventures);\n- \u25cf unusual items, i.e. income and charges that are unusual in their frequency, nature or amount, relating to significant litigation or impairment of operating receivables.\n\nWith  the  exception  of  the  tax  charge,  the  share  in  net income  of  associates  and  joint  ventures,  and  financial interest  on  pension  and  other  long-term  employee  benefit obligations,  all  income  and  expenses  resulting  from  the sales  financing  activity  are  included  in  operating  income and expenses.\n\n## Equity method consolidation of associates and joint ventures\n\nThe  share  in  net  income  of  associates  and  joint  ventures reported  in  the  Group's  consolidated  income  statement comprises  the  share  in  these  entities'  profits  or  losses, impairment and recoveries of impairment relating to these entities (Note 2-M).\n\nThe  gain  or  loss  resulting  from  the  sale  or  loss  of  significant influence  or  joint  control  over  associates  and  joint  ventures accounted for under the equity method, and the gain or loss on acquisition  of  control,  as  defined  by  IFRS  10,  over  companies that were already consolidated but not controlled, is reported in other  operating  income  and  expenses  in  the  Group's consolidated  income  statement.  This  includes  transfers  of accumulated  translation  adjustments  during  the  period  the entity was accounted for under the equity method.",

This tax is included in current and deferred taxes in the Group's income statement.\n\nGoodwill relating to associates and joint ventures is included in the value of the relevant entities as stated in the assets in the  consolidated  statement  of  financial  position.  In  the event  of  impairment,  an  impairment  loss  is  booked  and included  in  the  consolidated  income  statement  via  the share in  net  income  (loss)  of  associates  and  joint  ventures (Note 2-J).\n\nAcquisition  expenses  related  to  investments  in  associates and joint ventures are included in the initial acquisition cost for these investments.\n\nCross-investments  between  a  consolidated  entity  and  an associate are neutralized in measuring the investment in the associate  as  stated  in  the  assets  of  the  statement  of financial position. Nissan's 15% stake in Renault is therefore neutralized in valuing the investment in Nissan shown in the assets  of  the  consolidated  statement  of  financial  position (Note 12).\n\nDividends  received  from  unlisted  associates  and  joint ventures  are  included  in  the  Automotive  operational  free cash  flow,  while  dividends  received  from  listed  associates and joint ventures, i.e. Nissan, are excluded from Automotive operational free cash flow.\n\n## Information by operating segment\n\nThe  information  by  operating  segment  is  based  on  internal reporting  to  the  Leadership  Team,  which  is  identified  as  the 'Chief Operating Decision-Maker'. All Group financial data are\n\nassigned  to  the  operating  segments.  The  'Intersegment transactions' column is reserved for transactions between the segments,  which  are  carried  out  on  near-market  terms. Dividend  payments  by  the  Sales  Financing  segment  are included  in  net  financial  income  and  expenses  of  the Automotive segment.\n\nThe indicator used to evaluate segment performance is the operating margin.\n\nThe effects of the French consolidated taxation system are included in the tax expense of the Automotive segment.\n\nAssets  and  liabilities are specific to each  segment. Receivables  assigned  by  the  Automotive  segment  to  the Sales Financing companies are treated as operating assets by the assignee when  the  risks and benefits are substantially  transferred.  These  receivables  are  mostly receivables on the dealership network.\n\nVehicles  and  batteries  for  which  the  Automotive  segment has a repurchase  commitment  are  included  in  the segment's  assets.  When  these  assets  are  financed  by  the Sales  Financing  segment,  the  Sales  Financing  segment recognizes a receivable on the Automotive segment.\n\n## Current and non-current assets and liabilities\n\nSales  Financing  receivables,  other  securities,  derivatives, loans and financial liabilities of the Sales Financing segment (other than redeemable shares and subordinated loans) are considered  as  current  assets  and  liabilities,  because  they are used in this operating segment's normal business cycle.\n\nFor  the  Automotive  segment,  in  addition  to  items  directly related  to  the  business  cycle,  all  assets  and  liabilities maturing within one year are classified as current.\n\n## 2-E. Translation of foreign companies' financial statements into the presentation currency and hyperinflation effects\n\n## Translation of the accounts of foreign companies\n\nThe Group's presentation currency is the euro.\n\nFor foreign companies, the functional currency is generally the  local  currency.  In  cases  where  most  transactions  are carried  out  in  a  different  currency,  that  is  adopted  as  the functional currency.\n\nForeign  companies'  accounts  are  established  in  their functional  currency,  and  subsequently  translated  into  the Group's presentation currency as follows:\n\n- \u25cf financial  position  items  other  than  components  of shareholders' equity, which are stated at historical value, are translated at the closing exchange rate;\n- \u25cf income  statement  items  are  translated  at  the  average exchange rate for the period;\n- \u25cf the translation adjustment is one of the other components  of  comprehensive  income,  and  therefore has no impact on net income.\n\nGoodwill  generated  by  a  business  combination  with  a foreign  company  is  treated  as  an  asset  or  liability  of  the entity acquired, as appropriate. It is therefore expressed in the relevant entity's functional currency, and translated into euros at the closing rate.\n\nWhen  a  foreign  company  is  sold,  the  accumulated translation  adjustments  on  its  assets  and  liabilities  are transferred to other operating income and expenses in the income statement.\n\n## Hyperinflation\n\nTo  determine  whether  a  country  is  in  hyperinflation,  the Group  refers  to  the  list  published  by  the  International Practices Task Force (IPTF) of the Center for Audit Quality. The  financial  statements  of  entities  in  hyperinflationary economies are translated in accordance with IAS 29 'Financial reporting in hyperinflationary economies'. Non-monetary  balance  sheet  items,  income  statement items, comprehensive  income  items  and  cash  flow statement  items  are  adjusted  for  inflation  in  their  original local  currency,  then  all  the  financial  statements  are",

This hyperinflationary accounting leads to recognition of a gain or  loss  resulting  from  exposure  to  hyperinflation,  which  is classified as other financial income and expenses and thus included in reserves the following year.\n\nThe  accounts  of  the  Group's  subsidiaries  in  Argentina  are consolidated  in  accordance  with  the  principles  of  IAS  29, which have been applied since January 1, 2018. The effects of index-based restatement and translation of the shareholders'  equity  of  subsidiaries  in  Argentina  are  all included in the translation adjustment in other components of  comprehensive  income,  since  restatement  based  on price indexes is correlated with movements in the exchange rate  between  the  Argentinian  peso  and  the  euro,  and mitigates the effect of the peso's devaluation.\n\n## 2-F. Translation of foreign currency transactions\n\nTransactions  undertaken  in  a  currency  other  than  the functional  currency  of  the  entity  concerned  are  initially translated to and recorded in the functional currency, using the rate applicable at the transaction date.\n\nFor  financial  reporting  purposes,  monetary  assets  and liabilities  in  currencies  other  than  the  functional  currency are  translated  at  the  closing  rate.  All  resulting  foreign exchange  differences  are  recognized  in  the  income statement, except for foreign exchange gains and losses on financial  instruments  designated  as  hedges  of  a  net investment in a foreign entity (Note 2-X).\n\n## 2-G. Revenues and margin\n\nRevenues comprise all proceeds from sales of the Group's automotive goods, services related to these sales, and the various  sales  financing  products  marketed  by  the  Group's companies to their customers.\n\n## Sales of goods and services and associated costs of the Automotive segment\n\n## Sales and margin recognition\n\nSales  of  automotive  goods  are  recognized  at  the  date control is transferred. The transfer of control over automotive  goods  takes  place  when  the  goods  are  made available  to  the  distribution  network  in  the  case  of  nonGroup  dealers  (at  the  time  they  are  added  to  or  removed from stock, depending on the contractual arrangements) or upon delivery to the end-user in the case of direct sales.\n\nHowever, there is no transfer of control in the case of goods sold under an operating lease by a Group finance company, or in the case of goods sold with a buy-back commitment if it is highly likely that they will be returned. In such transactions,  the  revenues  are  recognized  progressively over  the  lease  period,  and  a  used  vehicle  sale  is  recorded when  control  of  the  used  vehicle  is  transferred.  The difference between the price paid by the customer and the buy-back price is treated as rental income, and spread over the period the automotive item is at the customer's disposal. The production cost for the new automotive item concerned\n\nOn March 16, 2022 Turkey was identified by the International Practices Task Force (IPTF) of the Center for Audit Quality as a  country  that  should  be  considered  hyperinflationary  for the purposes of 2022 financial statements.\n\nThe  entities  MAIS  Motorlu  Araclar  Imal  ve  Satis  AS  and ORFIN Finansman Anonim Sirketi, which are accounted for under  the  equity  method,  use  the  local  currency  as  their functional  currency  and  have  applied  the  hyperinflation adjustment  at  December  31,  2023.  Its  effect  on  their contribution to the Group financial statements is considered non-significant. The fully consolidated entities Oyak  Renault  and  Renault  Group  Otomotiv  prepare  their accounts  for  the  Group  consolidation  using  the  euro  as their  functional  currency,  since  most  of  their  business  is conducted  in  euros.  Consequently,  their  accounts  do  not require adjustment for hyperinflation.\n\nThe following impacts are therefore recorded in net income:\n\n- \u25cf translation adjustments related to financial operations by the Automotive segment are included in the net financial income;\n- \u25cf other translation adjustments  are  included  in  the operating income (operating margin in the information by operating segment).\n\nDerivatives  are  measured  and  recorded  as  described  in Note 2-X.\n\nis recorded in inventories for contracts of less than one year, or  included  in  property,  plant  and  equipment  under  fixed assets leased to customers when the contracts exceed one year.  The  forecast  resale  value  takes  account  of  recent known  developments  on  the  second-hand  automotive market but  also  future  anticipated  developments  over  the period  in  which  the  automotive  goods  will  be  sold,  which may  be  influenced  by  factors  both  external  (economic situation, taxation) and internal (changes in the range or the manufacturer's  pricing  strategy).  As  soon  as  a  loss  is expected on the resale, a provision (if the automotive item is in  inventories) or additional depreciation (if the automotive item  is  included  in  property,  plant  and  equipment)  is recognized to cover the loss.\n\n## Sales incentive programs\n\nSales incentive programs based on the volumes or prices of products  sold  are  deducted  from  sales  when  the  sales operations  concerned  are  recorded.  Any  provisions  are based on estimates of the most probable amount.\n\nThe  Group  undertakes  certain  promotional  campaigns offering  reduced-interest  customer  credit  or  discounts  on services.  Because  these  are  sales  incentives,  the  cost  of these operations is recognized as a reduction in sales by the Automotive segment when the vehicle sale takes place, and is  not  spread  over  the  duration  of  the  financing  or  the services concerned.",

Provisions  are established  for  insurance-type  warranties,  while  servicetype warranties give rise to revenue that is spread over the duration of the warranty extension.\n\nThe estimated or incurred costs relating to manufacturer's product  or  part  warranties  classified  as  insurance-type warranties  are  charged  to  expenses  when  the  sales  are recorded. Provisions for costs still to be borne are valued on the  basis  of  observed  data  for  each  model  and  engine regarding the level of costs,  and  their  distribution  over  the periods  covered  by  the  manufacturer's  warranty.  In  the event  of  product  recalls  following  incidents  that  come  to light after the vehicle has been put on the market, provisions are  established  to  cover  the  costs  involved  as  soon  as  the decision to undertake the recall campaign has been made. Amounts  claimed  from  suppliers  are  deducted  from  the warranty expense when it is considered practically certain they will be recovered.\n\n## Services related to sales of automotive products\n\nRevenues  from  service  contracts  sold  by  the  Group  are recognized  on  a  percentage-of-completion  basis.  These contracts may be for warranty extensions, maintenance or insurance.\n\nSuch service contracts may be sold separately to the final customer  or  included  free  of  charge  in  a  sale  package covering  a  vehicle  and  related  services.  In  either  case,  the Group  considers  service  contracts  as  a  separate  service obligation  from  delivery  of  the  vehicle,  and  allocates  a portion of revenue to the service contract.\n\nWhen the customer makes regular payments for the service contract, the revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis. When the contract is prepaid (for example, when it is paid for by  the  customer  at  the  time  of  the  vehicle  purchase),  the amounts  received  are  recorded  as  deferred  income,  and spread over the duration of the contract, on a straight-line basis for warranty extensions and following an experience curve for maintenance contracts.\n\n## Impairment of customer receivables\n\nImpairment  is  booked  in  respect  of  the  Automotive segment's customer receivables to reflect the prospective assessment  of  the  credit  risk  at  the  inception  of  the receivable and any deterioration of that risk over time. When there  is  an  incurred  credit  loss,  impairment  is  recorded individually for each receivable.\n\n## Sales financing revenues\n\n## Sales financing revenues\n\nSales  financing  revenues  are  generated  by  financing operations  for  sales  of  vehicles  to  dealers  and  end-users. These financing operations take the form of loans from the Sales Financing segment companies, and are carried in the balance sheet at amortized cost under the effective interest\n\nrate  method,  less  any  impairment.  Income  on  these contracts is calculated so as to give a constant interest rate over the period, and is included in sales revenues.\n\n## Sales financing costs\n\nSales financing costs are considered as operating expenses and included in the operating income (operating margin in the information  by  operating  segment).  They  mainly comprise interest incurred by Sales Financing companies to refinance their customer loan transactions, other costs and revenues  directly  related  to  administration  of  this  type  of refinancing (temporary investments, hedging and management of exchange and interest rate risks), and the cost of risks related to receivables. Refinancing comes from diversified  sources:  public  and  private  bond  issues,  public and  private  securitization  backed  by  Automotive  segment loans,  negotiable  debt  instruments,  savings  collected  and financing  from  credit  institutions  and  assimilate  or  the European Central Bank.\n\n## Commissions payable to business intermediaries\n\nCommissions  are  treated  as  external  distribution  costs,  and therefore deferred as contract acquisition costs, so as to give a constant interest rate over the term of the financing contracts.\n\n## Classification and impairment of receivables\n\nThe  impairment  method  for  financial  receivables  depends on the category concerned. For healthy receivables (stage 1), impairment  is  equivalent  to  the  12-month  expected  credit loss; for receivables on which the credit risk has significantly deteriorated  since  initial  recognition  or  which  received extensions  during  the  lockdown  (stage  2),  impairment  is equivalent to the lifetime expected  losses;  and  for receivables in default (stage 3), impairment is equivalent to the incurred credit loss.\n\nThe  Sales  Financing  segment  uses  an  internal  scoring system  or  external  ratings  to  identify  any  significant deterioration in the credit risk. In addition, this segment has decided to use the assumptions set out in the standard and thus downgrades any receivable outstanding after 30 days to stage 2, and any receivable still outstanding after 90 days to stage 3. Receivables in default (stage 3) are identified by the  Sales  Financing  segment  in  compliance  with  the European  Banking  Authority's  EBA/GL/2016/07  guidelines. The Sales Financing segment has opted for the 'one step' approach, which consists of applying the new definition of default  and  adjusting  its  internal  models  concurrently  for the Dealer portfolio and Customer portfolio.\n\nThe  Sales  Financing  segment  refers  to  the  current recommendations of the Basel Committee to generate the parameters  needed  to  calculate  the  probability  of  default and  the  loss  rates  in  the  event  of  default  on  loans  and financing,  finance  lease  receivables,  irrevocable  financing commitments, and financial guarantees given to customers and dealers in its principal countries of business (Germany, Brazil,  Spain,  France,  Italy  and  the  United  Kingdom  for customer  and  dealer  financing,  Korea  for  customer financing  only).  For  other  assets,  a  standard  approach based on a simplified methodology is applied.\n\nI",

The asset\n\n## 2-H. Financial income (expenses)\n\nThe cost of net financial indebtedness comprises the cost of gross  financial  indebtedness  less  income  associated  with cash, cash  equivalents  and  financial  assets  of  the Automotive segment. The cost of gross financial indebtedness consists of income and expenses generated by the Automotive segment's financial indebtedness during the  period,  including  the  impact  of  the  effective  portion  of the related interest rate hedges.\n\n## 2-I.Income tax\n\nThe  Group  recognizes  deferred  taxes  for  all  temporary differences between the tax and book values of assets and liabilities in the consolidated statement of financial position. Deferred taxes are calculated at the latest tax rate enacted at the closing date applicable to the period when temporary differences are reversed. Each individual fiscal entity (legal entity, establishment or group of entities that pays tax to the tax  administration)  that  is  authorized  to  offset  its  current tax  assets  and  liabilities  reports  deferred  tax  assets  and liabilities net. Recognition of deferred tax assets depends on the probability of future recovery.\n\n## 2-J. Goodwill\n\nNon-controlling interests (commonly called 'minority interests') are carried at fair value (the full goodwill method) or  at  their  share  in  the  fair  value  of  assets  acquired  and liabilities transferred (the partial goodwill method). To date Renault  has  only  recognized  goodwill  valued  under  the partial goodwill method. The choice of which method to use is made for each individual case.\n\nImpairment  tests  of  goodwill  are  carried  out  at  least annually or whenever there is evidence of loss of value. After initial  recognition,  goodwill  is  stated  at  cost  less  any accumulated impairment.\n\nis  derecognized  via  a  loss  account,  and  the  associated impairment  is  reversed  when  the  non-recoverability  of receivables  is  confirmed,  or  at  the  latest  when  the  Sales Financing  segment's  rights  as  creditor  are  extinguished. Examples of receivables that become non-recoverable and are  derecognized  are  waivers  negotiated  with  customers (notably as part of a recovery plan), time-barred receivables, receivables concerned by an unfavourable legal judgement (when the outcome of a lawsuit or litigation is negative), and receivables owed by a customer that no longer exists.\n\nOther financial income and expenses mainly include foreign exchange  gains  and  losses  on  financial  items  and  related hedges, the gain or loss caused by exposure to hyperinflation (Note  2-E),  the  net  interest  on  provisions  for  pensions,  and dividends  and  impairment  of  companies  that  are  neither controlled nor under significant influence by the Group.\n\nFor associates and joint ventures, a deferred tax liability on dividend distributions is booked for differences between the book value and tax value of shares held.\n\nTax  credits  that  can  only  be  used  against  a  taxable  profit are recorded as a deduction from the income tax payable. Tax credits that are recoverable regardless of whether the company  makes  a  taxable  profit  are  set  against  the relevant nature of expense.\n\nTo determine the provisions for uncertain tax liabilities, the Group  uses  a  case-by-case  method  based  on  the  most probable  value.  In  view  of  their  qualitative  characteristics these  provisions  are  reported  on  specific  lines  in  the consolidated financial position.\n\nGoodwill relating to associates and joint ventures is included in  the  value  of  the  entities  concerned  as  reported  in  the assets in the statement of financial position. In the event of impairment,  an  impairment  loss  is  booked  and  included  in the  consolidated  income  statement  via  the  share  in  net income (loss) of associates and joint ventures.\n\nAcquisitions  of  additional  investments  concerning  noncontrolling  interests  in  companies  controlled  by  the  Group are treated as equity transactions. The positive or negative difference  between  the  cost  of  acquiring  shares  and  the book  value  of  the  non-controlling  interests  acquired  is recorded in shareholders' equity.",

Research and development expenses and other intangible assets\n\n## Research and development expenses\n\nDevelopment  expenses  incurred  between  the  decision  to begin development and implement production facilities for a new vehicle or component (e.g. engine or gearbox) and the subsequent approval of the design for mass production are capitalized  as  intangible  assets.  They  are  amortized  on  a straight-line basis from the date of approval for production, over the expected market life of the vehicle or part, which is initially no  longer  than  seven  years.  Market  lives  are regularly  reviewed  and  subsequently  adjusted  if  there  is  a significant  difference  from  the  initial  estimate.  Capitalized development  expenses  mainly  comprise  the  cost  of prototypes,  the  cost  of  studies  invoiced  by  external  firms, the cost of personnel assigned to the project and a share of overheads dedicated exclusively to development activities.\n\nBorrowing costs directly attributable to the development of a project requiring at least 12 months of preparation before commissioning are included in the gross value of the asset, which  is  a  'qualifying  asset'.  The  capitalization  rate  for borrowing  costs  is  limited  such  that  capitalized  borrowing costs do not exceed the total borrowing costs borne during the  year.  When  a  project  is  financed  through  a  specific\n\nborrowing, the capitalization rate is equal to the interest rate on the borrowing.\n\nExpenses  incurred  before  the  decision  to  begin  product development are  recorded  as  costs  in  the  period  they  are incurred, in the same way as research expenses. Expenses incurred  after  the  start  of  mass  production  are  treated  as production costs.\n\n## Other intangible assets\n\nOther intangible assets comprise patents, leasehold rights, intangible  business  assets,  licences,  software,  brands  and similar  rights  purchased  by  the  Group.  When  they  have  a finite  useful  life,  patents,  leasehold  rights,  licences,  brands and  similar  rights  purchased  are  amortized  on  a  straightline  basis  over  the  period  of  protection  stipulated  by  the contact or the law, or over the useful life if shorter. Intangible business  assets  and  softwares  are  amortized  over  their useful  life.  The  useful  life  of  intangible  assets  is  generally between 3 and 5 years. Intangible assets with an indefinite useful life, are subjected to an impairment test at least once a year and when there is any indication of impairment.\n\n## 2-L. Property, plant and equipment and right-of-use assets\n\nThe gross value of property, plant and  equipment corresponds to historical acquisition or production cost.\n\nDesign and preparation expenses are included in the asset's production cost.\n\nThe  production  cost  for  property,  plant  and  equipment  also includes  financing  costs  borne  during  the  construction  phase, under the same method as for intangible assets. When a project is financed through a specific borrowing, the capitalization rate is equal to the interest rate on the borrowing.\n\nInvestment subsidies received are, where relevant, presented as a deduction from the gross value of the assets concerned.\n\nSubsequent  expenses  for  property,  plant  and  equipment, except  those  incurred  to  increase  productivity  or  prolong the life of an asset, are charged to expenses as incurred.\n\nAssets leased to customers include vehicles leased for more than  one  year  from  a  Group  finance  company  with  a  buyback commitment by the Group, and vehicles sold under an agreement including a clause for buy-back after a minimum one  year  of  use.  Assets  leased  to  customers  also  include vehicles  covered  by  operating  leases  longer  than  one  year from  Group  finance  companies,  and  batteries  leased  to electric vehicle users by Group finance companies (Note 2-G).\n\n## Right-of-use assets\n\nThe Group's leases are essentially for real estate property.\n\nA contract contains a lease if it gives the lessee the right to use  an  identified  asset  for  a  specified  period  of  time  in exchange for payment.\n\nAt  the  contract's  commencement  date,  an  asset  related  to the right of use is recognized together with a financial liability initially estimated  at  the  present  value  of  fixed  lease payments over the term of the lease. This asset is amortized using a discount rate equal to the implicit interest rate of the lease  agreement  if  it  can  be  readily  determined,  or  the incremental  borrowing  rate  otherwise.  The  incremental borrowing rate, calculated for each monetary zone, corresponds to the risk-free rate applicable in the zone plus the Group's risk premium applicable for the local currency. In the income statement, amortization of the right-of-use asset is recorded in the operating income (operating margin in the information by operating segment) and a financial expense corresponding to the interest on the lease liability is recorded in financial income and expenses. In the cash flow statement, cash flows from operating activities are impacted by interest expenses paid, and cash flows from financing activities are impacted by the reimbursed lease liability.\n\nI\n\nFinancial statements\n\n05",

When  the  Group  revises  the  exercise  value  of  a  purchase, extension  or  termination  option  (for  example  by  applying early  termination  clauses),  a  corresponding  adjustment  is made to the book value of the right-of-use asset.\n\nImprovements  to  leased  buildings  are  depreciated  over  a duration that is equal to or shorter than the lease term used to  estimate  the  lease  liability  (if  the  lessee  has  neither  the intention nor the ability to use them for a longer period).\n\nWhen  a  lease  contract  contains  a  purchase  option  the Group is reasonably certain to exercise, it is in substance a purchase rather than a lease. The corresponding liability is considered as a financial liability under IFRS 9, and the asset as a tangible asset in compliance with IAS 16.\n\nProvisions for  repairs  required  contractually  by  lessors  are recognized  at  the  start  of  the  lease,  with  a  corresponding tangible asset.\n\n## Sale and leaseback operations\n\nIn application of IFRS 16, for a sale and leaseback operation, reference  is  made  to  the  requirements  of  IFRS  15  to determine  whether  the  transfer  of  the  asset  should  be treated as a sale or a financing operation.\n\nIf  the  transfer  of  an  asset  does  not  qualify  under  IFRS  15  for recognition as a sale, the asset transferred remains in the assets reported in  the  statement  of  financial  position,  and  a  financial liability equal to the proceeds of the transfer is recognized.\n\nIf  the  transfer  of  an  asset  is  recognized  as  a  sale  and  the Group then leases back part or all of the asset sold, only the amount of the gain or loss on the rights transferred to the buyer-lessor  is  recognized,  and  the  right-of-use  asset  is adjusted  in  proportion  to  the  interest  retained  in  the  net book value of the asset transferred.\n\n## Depreciation\n\nIn the Automotive and Sales Financing segments, depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the following estimated useful lives:\n\n| Buildings  (1)                                     | 15 to 30 years   |\n|----------------------------------------------------|------------------|\n| Specific tools                                     | 2 to 7 years     |\n| Machinery and other tools (other than press lines) | 5 to 15 years    |\n| Press lines, stamping and painting installations   | 20 to 30 years   |\n| Other tangible assets  (2)                         | 4 to 6 years     |\n\n- (1) Buildings in use before 1987 are depreciated over a period of up to 40 years.\n\nUseful lives are regularly reviewed,  and  accelerated depreciation  is  recorded  when  an  asset's  useful  life becomes shorter  than  the  initially  expected  period  of  use, particularly  when  it  is  decided  to  withdraw  a  vehicle  or component from the market.",

Impairment\n\n## Impairment of fixed assets\n\nFixed assets are subjected to impairment tests as soon as there is any indication of a loss of value, such as significant adverse  changes  in  the  market  in  which  the  company operates,  or  changes  affecting  the  circumstances  and manner of use of the assets.\n\nFor  the Automotive segment ,  impairment  tests  are  carried out at two levels:\n\n## At the level of vehicle-specific assets (including components)\n\nVehicle-specific  assets  (including  components)  consist  of capitalized  development  expenses  and  tools.  Impairment tests are carried out by comparing the net book value of the assets  with  the  recoverable  value,  calculated  based  on discounted future cash flows related to the vehicle and its components.  These  assets  may  be  specific  to  the  model and/or the country of destination.\n\n## At the level of cash-generating units\n\nA  cash-generating  unit  is  defined  as  a  coherent  subset  that generates  largely  independent  cash  flows.  Cash-generating units may represent an economic entity (plant or subsidiary) or the  whole  Automotive  segment.  Net  fixed  assets  related  to cash-generating units notably include goodwill, specific assets and capacity assets, and components of working capital.\n\nFor each of the two levels, impairment tests are carried out by comparing the net book value with the recoverable value. Recoverable value is defined as the higher of value in use or fair value less selling costs.\n\nValue  in  use  is  the  present  value  of  estimated  future  cash flows expected to arise from the use of an asset. Future cash flows derive from the business plan drawn up and validated by  the  Management,  plus  a  terminal  value  based  on discounted  normative  cash  flows  after  application  of  a growth  rate  to  infinity.  They  also  include  a  bonus  ('excess earnings')  paid  to  the  Automotive  segment  for  business referrals to the Sales Financing segment. The assumptions underlying  the  business  plan  include  estimates  of  market developments in countries in which the Group operates and\n\nits  share  of  those  markets,  changes  in  the  sale  price  of products  and  the  prices  of  purchased  components  and commodities. The pre-tax discount rate used is the weighted average cost of capital as determined by the company.\n\nWhen the recoverable value is lower than the net book value, impairment equivalent to the difference is recorded against the assets concerned.\n\nFor  the Sales  Financing  segment , an  impairment  test  is carried  out  at  least  once  a  year  or  whenever  there  is  an indication of loss of value, by comparing the book value and recoverable value of assets. Recoverable value is defined as the higher of fair value (less selling costs) and value in use. The value in use is based on a market approach, determined by using multiples for each group of cash-generating units made up of  legal  entities  or  groups  of  legal  entities  in  the same country.\n\n## Impairment of investments in associates and joint ventures\n\nImpairment tests of the value of investments in associates and  joint  ventures  are  carried  out  as  soon  as  there  is  any indication of a loss of value, essentially significant adverse changes in the markets in which the company operates, or a major or long-term decline in stock market value.\n\nImpairment tests are carried out in compliance with IAS 28 and IAS 36, by comparing the book value of the investment in the associate or joint venture with the recoverable value, which is the higher of value in use and fair value, less selling costs.  The  value  in  use  is  equal  to  the  share  of  the  present value  of  future  estimated  cash  flows  expected  by  the associate or joint venture. If the associate or joint venture is listed, the fair value is its stock market value.\n\nWhen  the  recoverable  value  is  lower  than  the  book  value, impairment equivalent to the difference is recorded against the relevant investment in an associate or joint venture, and included  in  the  Group's  income  statement  via  the  share  in net income (loss) of associates and joint ventures.\n\n## 2-N. Non-current assets or groups of assets and liabilities held for sale and discontinued operations\n\nAssets and liabilities held for sale are non-current assets or groups  of  assets  and  liabilities  that  are  available  for immediate sale and are highly likely to be sold within twelve months due to advanced discussions with a known buyer.\n\nAssets and groups of assets and liabilities held for sale are presented  separately  in  the  statement  of  consolidated financial position, in accordance with IFRS 5. They are stated at  the  lower  of  net  book  value  and  fair  value  less  selling costs. No further depreciation or amortization is recorded on\n\nnon-current  assets  that  are  classified  as  held  for  sale  (or included in a group of assets and liabilities held for sale).\n\nDiscontinued operations, as defined by IFRS 5 - Non-current Assets  Held  for  Sale  and  Discontinued  Operations,  are activities  or  geographical  zones  that  are  significant  to  the Group and are in the process of being sold or are classified as assets held for sale. The income statement and cash flow statement  items  relating  to  discontinued  operations  are presented  on  specific  lines  in  the  consolidated  financial statements for all the periods presented.\n\nI",

Cost  corresponds  to  acquisition  cost  or  production cost, which includes direct and indirect production expenses and a share of manufacturing overheads, based on a forecast level of activity, and the results of any related hedges. The level of activity is forecast site by site, in order to  determine the share of fixed costs to be excluded if the actual level of activity is lower.\n\n## 2-P. Assignment of receivables and reverse factoring\n\nReceivables assigned to third parties (through securitization,  discounting,  or  factoring)  are  removed  from Group  assets  when  the  associated  risks  and  benefits  are also substantially transferred to the third parties in question. Risk analysis principally concerns the credit risk, the risk of late payment and the country risk. The same rule applies in the Automotive segment and the Sales Financing segment.\n\nThe Automotive segment sometimes uses reverse-factoring programs to support a supplier, or to benefit the Group by extending  payment  deadlines.  In  this  case,  the  amounts concerned are reclassified as financial liabilities (this has no impact  on  the  cash  flow  statement  at  the  reclassification date).  These  amounts  impact  cash  flows  from  financing activities  in  the  cash  flow  statement  when  the  payment  is made to the financial institution.\n\n## 2-Q. Treasury shares\n\nTreasury  shares  are  shares  held  for  the  purposes  of  stock option  plans,  performance  share  plans,  other  share-based payment arrangements, and the liquidity contract.\n\nThey  are  recorded  at  acquisition  cost  and  deducted  from Group shareholders' equity until the date of sale.\n\nWhen  these  shares  are  sold,  the  sale  price  is  directly included in consolidated shareholders' equity. Consequently, no gain or loss on treasury shares is included in the net income for the period.\n\n## 2-R. Performance share plans attribution plans and other share-based payment agreements\n\nThe  Group  awards  performance  shares  and  other  sharebased payments made in Renault shares. The grant date is the date at which beneficiaries are informed of the decision to award shares, and the terms of the share plan. For plans subject to performance conditions, an estimate of achievement  of  the  conditions  is  taken  into  account  in determining the number of shares distributed. This estimate is reviewed annually based on changes in the probability of performance condition achievement. The final fair value of services  rendered  in  return  for  performance  shares  is measured by reference to the fair value of those shares at their  grant  date.  Entitlements  to  performance  shares  are valued  based  on  the  share  value  at  the  grant  date  less\n\ndividends  expected  during  the  vesting  period.  The  share price volatility factor applied is implicit volatility at the grant date. The expected dividend is determined by reference to the dividend payout schedule announced at the time each plan is valued.\n\nThe  total  fair  value  calculated  in  this  way  is  spread  on  a straight-line  basis  over  the  entire  vesting  period.  This expense  is included in personnel expenses, with a corresponding adjustment to consolidated reserves. When the performance shares vest, the cash amount received by the  Group  in  settlement  of  the  exercise  price  is  booked  in cash and cash equivalents, with a corresponding adjustment to consolidated reserves.\n\nInventories  of  the  Automotive  segment  and  the  Sales Financing segment are valued under the FIFO (First In First Out) method.\n\nWhen  the  net  realizable  value  is  lower  than  the  financial position value, impairment equal to the difference is recorded.",

Under  this method, benefits are attributed to periods of service according to the plan's benefit formula, principally on a straight-line basis over the years of service that earn benefit entitlements.\n\nThe  future  payments  for  employee  benefits  are  measured on  the  basis  of  future  salary  increases,  retirement  age, mortality and length of employment with the company, and are discounted at a rate determined by reference to yields\n\n## 2-T. Workforce adjustment measures\n\nThe  estimated  cost  of  workforce  adjustment  measures, which  for  accounting  purposes  is  treated  as  an  employee benefit,  is  covered  by  a  provision  over  the  estimated residual employment period of the employees concerned.\n\nThe cost of termination indemnities is recognized as soon as a detailed plan has either been announced or is in progress. The amount  recorded  is  net  of  existing provisions for pensions.\n\n## 2-U. Financial assets and receivables of the Sales Financing segment\n\nThe Group recognizes a financial asset when it becomes a party to the contractual provisions of a financial instrument.\n\nFinancial  assets  comprise  investments  in  non-controlled companies  in  which  Renault  does  not  exercise  significant influence, marketable securities, negotiable debt instruments, loans and derivative assets related to financial transactions (Note 2-X).\n\nThese  instruments  are  presented  as  non-current  assets, apart  from  those  maturing  within  12  months  of  the  closing date, which are classified as current assets.\n\n## Investments in non-controlled companies in which Renault does not have significant influence\n\nInvestments  in  non-controlled  companies  in  which  Renault does  not  have  significant  influence  are  classified  as  equity instruments  at  fair  value  through  profit  and  loss.  The  fair values of such financial assets are determined in priority by reference to the market price. If this is not possible, the Group uses a valuation method that is not based on market data.\n\n## Marketable securities and negotiable debt instruments\n\nShort-term investments in the form of marketable securities and  negotiable  debt  instruments  are  undertaken  for  the management  of  cash  surpluses,  but  do  not  meet  the requirements to qualify as cash equivalents. These are debt instruments carried at fair value through other components of  comprehensive income, except for shares in investment funds (UCITS) which are carried at fair value through profit and loss.\n\nImpairment equivalent to expected credit losses is booked upon  initial  recognition  of  debt  instruments  carried  at  fair value through other components of comprehensive income.\n\n## Loans\n\nLoans  essentially  include  loans  for  investment  of  cash surpluses and loans to associates.\n\nLoans are carried at amortized cost. Impairment equivalent to expected  credit  losses  is  recognized  upon  initial recognition  of  the  financial  asset,  and  when  there  is objective  evidence  of  loss  of  value  caused  by  an  event arising after the initial recognition.\n\nI\n\non  long-term  high  quality  corporate  bonds  of  a  duration corresponding  to  the  estimated  average  duration  of  the benefit plan concerned.\n\nThe actuarial gains and losses resulting from revisions of the underlying assumptions and experience-based adjustments are included in other components of comprehensive income.\n\nThe net expense for the year, corresponding to the current period  service  cost  plus  the  past  service  cost  where relevant,  is  charged  to  the  operating  income  (operating margin  in  the  information  by  operating  segment).  The interest expense on the net defined-benefit liability (asset) is recorded in the net financial income and expenses.\n\nFinancial statements\n\n05",

Cash and cash equivalents\n\nCash  includes  cash  on  hand,  current  accounts  and  other demand  deposits,  with  the  exception  of  bank  overdrafts, which are included in financial liabilities.\n\nCash  equivalents  are  investments  held  for  the  purpose  of meeting short-term cash commitments. For an investment to  qualify  as  a  cash  equivalent,  it  must  be  considered  as liquid,  be  readily  convertible  for  a  known  amount  of  cash and be subject to an insignificant risk of change in value.\n\nThese instruments are stated at amortized cost except for shares in investment funds (UCITS) which are carried at fair value through profit and loss.\n\nBank  accounts  subject  to  restrictions  due  to  sectorspecific  regulations  (for  example,  banking  or  insurance regulations)  or  bank  accounts  allocated  to  increasing credit on securitized receivables are included in cash and cash equivalents.\n\n## 2-W. Financial liabilities of the Automotive segment and Sales Financing debts\n\nThe Group recognizes a financial liability (for the Automotive segment)  or  a  Sales  Financing  debt  when  it  becomes  a party to the contractual provisions of a financial instrument.\n\nFinancial  liabilities  and  Sales  Financing  debts  comprise redeemable shares, subordinated debt, bonds, other debts represented  by  a  certificate,  borrowings  from  credit institutions, lease liabilities (Note 2-L), other interest-bearing borrowings  and  derivative  liabilities  related  to  financial transactions (Note 2-X).\n\nRedeemable  shares  of  the  Automotive  segment  are  listed subordinated  debt  instruments  that  earn  a  variable  return indexed  on  consolidated  revenues.  They  are  carried  at amortized cost, determined by discounting forecast\n\n## 2-X. Derivatives and hedge accounting\n\n## Measurement and presentation\n\nDerivatives are initially stated at fair value. This fair value is subsequently reviewed at each closing date.\n\n- \u25cf The  fair  value  of  forward  exchange  contracts  and currency swaps is determined by discounting future cash flows,  using  closing-date  market  rates  (exchange  and interest rates).\n- \u25cf The  fair  value  of  interest  rate  derivatives  is  the  amount the  Group  would  receive  (or  pay)  to  settle  outstanding contracts at the closing date, taking into account interest rates forward curves and the quality of the counterparty to  each  contract  at  the  closing  date.  This  fair  value includes accrued interest.\n- \u25cf The  fair  value  of  commodity  derivatives  is  based  on market conditions.\n\nThe  Automotive  segment's  derivatives  are  reported  in  the financial position as current if they mature within 12 months and  non-current  otherwise.  All  Sales  Financing  segment derivatives are reported in the financial position as current.\n\ncoupons using the effective interest rate on borrowings. The estimated effective interest rate takes account of indexation,  and  the  amortized  cost  recorded  in  financial result is re-estimated when there is a significant change in future  sales  prospects,  particularly  when  medium-term business plans are released.\n\nFinancial liabilities not concerned  by  specific  hedge accounting  methods  (Note  2-X)  are  generally  recorded  at amortized  cost  using  the  effective  interest  rate  method. Financial expense calculated in this way includes issuance expenses and issuance or redemption premiums, together with  the  impact  of  debt  renegotiations  when  the  old  and new terms are not substantially different.\n\n## Hedge accounting\n\nThe  treatment  of  derivatives  designated  as  hedging instruments depends on the type of hedging relationship:\n\n- \u25cf fair value hedge;\n- \u25cf cash flow hedge;\n- \u25cf hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation.\n\nThe Group identifies the hedging instrument and the hedged item  as  soon  as  the  hedge  is  set  up,  and  documents  the hedging relationship, stating the hedging strategy, the risk hedged  and  the  method  used  to  assess  the  hedge's effectiveness.  The  Sales  Financing  segment  documents hedging relationships concerning one or more homogeneous items to cover its risks. This documentation is subsequently  updated  such  that  the  effectiveness  of  the designated hedge can be demonstrated.\n\nHedge accounting uses specific measurement and recognition methods for each category of hedge.",

As  changes  in  these  items  are recorded  in  the  income  statement  simultaneously,  only the ineffective portion of the hedge has an impact on net income. It is recorded in the same income statement item as changes in the fair value of the hedged item and the hedging instrument.\n- \u25cf Cash flow hedges: no adjustment is made to the value of the hedged item; only the hedging instrument is adjusted to fair value. Following this adjustment, the effective portion of the change  in  fair  value  attributable  to  the  hedged  risk  is recorded, net of taxes, in other components of comprehensive  income,  while  the  ineffective  portion  is included in net income. The cumulative amount included in shareholders' equity is transferred to the income statement when the hedged item has an impact on net income.\n- \u25cf Hedge  of  a  net  investment  in  a  foreign  operation:  the hedging instrument is adjusted to fair value. Following this adjustment,  the  effective  portion  of  the  change  in  fair\n\nvalue  attributable  to  the  hedged  exchange  risk  is recorded, net of taxes, in other components  of comprehensive  income,  while  the  ineffective  portion  is included in net income. The cumulative amount included in shareholders' equity is transferred to net income at the date of liquidation or sale of the investment. The interest rate component of borrowings in yen used to hedge the investment  in  Nissan  is  considered  as  the  ineffective portion,  and  is  therefore  recorded  directly  in  financial income and expenses.\n\n## Derivatives not designated as hedges\n\nChanges in the fair  value  of  derivatives  not  designated  as hedges are recognized directly in financial income, except in  the  case  of  derivatives  entered  into  exclusively  for reasons closely related to business operations. In this case, changes in the fair value of derivatives are included in the operating  income  (operating  margin  in  the  information  by operating segment).\n\n## Note 3 - Changes in the scope of consolidation and assets and liabilities held for sale\n\n|                                                                   |   Automotive |   Sales Financing | Mobility Services   |   Total |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|-------------------|---------------------|---------|\n| Number of companies consolidated at December 31, 2022             |          118 |                51 | 19                  |     188 |\n| Newly consolidated companies (acquisitions, formations, etc.)     |           10 |                 5 | 8                   |      23 |\n| Deconsolidated companies (disposals, mergers, liquidations, etc.) |           15 |                 2 |                     |      17 |\n| Number of companies consolidated at December 31, 2023             |          113 |                54 | 27                  |     194 |\n\n## 3-A.

These shares, sold for  \u20ac764  million,  represent  a  proportion  of  equity-method investments of \u20ac (1 536) million, a goodwill adjustment of \u20ac (40) million, \u20ac67 million of neutralization of Renault's share in Nissan and conversion reserves of \u20ac (135) million.\n\nIt  also  includes  a  disposal  result  of  \u20ac60  million  related  to the deconsolidation  of  the  JMEV  company  and  its\n\nsubsidiaries,  and  a  charge  of  \u20ac  (14)  million  on  the  sale  of RNL  Leasing  shares,  along  with  various  gains  on  the disposal of European subsidiaries.\n\nIn 2022, the Group recorded a gain of \u20ac26 million on the sale of  its  investment  in  Renault  Nordic  AB,  the  distribution company  which  operates  in  the  Swedish  and  Danish markets, to a local importer. In the second half 2022, costs associated  with  the  sale  of  Fonderie  de  Bretagne  were recognized at the total amount of \u20ac (57) million.\n\n## 6-C. Gains and losses on disposal of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets\n\nThe  Group  undertook  real  estate  operations  during  2023 that generated a gain of \u20ac228 million, principally in France with sales of land and industrial sites.\n\nThe  Group  undertook  real  estate  operations  in  2022  that generated  a  gain  of  \u20ac178  million,  principally  including  the\n\nsale  of  a  logistic  warehouse  and  a  real  estate  property  in France generating a gain of \u20ac97 million, and sales of various real  estate  complexes  in  France  and  Europe,  generating  a gain of \u20ac98 million.\n\n## 6-D.

No impairment was reversed during 2023.\n\n## 6-E. Other unusual items\n\nOther  unusual  items  in  2023  generated  a  net  expense  of \u20ac(180)  million.  These  items  mainly  include  \u20ac(104)  million  for reorganization  of  the  business  activities  in  India  and \u20ac(68)  million  relating  to  onerous  contracts,  due  to  lower purchase volumes.\n\nIn  2022,  impairment  amounting  to  \u20ac(257)  million  net  of reversals  was  recorded,  principally  recognized  on  excess production  capacity  assets  in  China.  No  impairment  was recorded in the first-half of 2022.\n\nIn 2022, the partial resumption of business activity in Algeria, which  had  been  halted  in  2020  following  decisions  by  the Algerian government, led to recovery of \u20ac19 million.\n\n## Note 7 - Financial income (expenses)\n\n| (\u20ac million)                                                                                                                                    | 2023   | 2022   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Cost of gross financial indebtedness                                                                                                           | (326)  | (349)  |\n| Income on cash and financial assets                                                                                                            | 414    | 168    |\n| Cost of net financial indebtedness                                                                                                             | 88     | (181)  |\n| Dividends received from companies that are neither controlled nor under significant influence                                                  | 1      | 2      |\n| Foreign exchange gains and losses on financial operations                                                                                      | 86     | 74     |\n| Gain/Loss on exposure to hyperinflation  \u207d \u00b9 \u207e                                                                                                 | (470)  | (292)  |\n| Net interest expenses on the defined-benefit liabilities and assets corresponding to pension and  other long-term employee benefit obligations | (42)   | (21)   |\n| Other  \u207d \u00b2 \u207e                                                                                                                                   | (190)  | (68)   |\n| Other financial income and expenses                                                                                                            | (615)  | (305)  |\n| FINANCIAL INCOME (EXPENSE)                                                                                                                     | (527)  | (486)  |\n\nThe net cash position (or net financial indebtedness) of the Automotive segment is presented in the information by operating segment (see section 6.1.A4).\n\nI\n\n05",

This  charge  increased  in  2023,  due  to  the  favorable  taxable income linked to the Group's economic activity.\n\nThe change in deferred taxes stood at \u20ac321 million and rose sharply  in  2023  due  to  various  tax  reversal  effects.  This change comes from French entities for \u20ac187 million and from foreign entities for \u20ac134 million.\n\n## 8-B.

Global Minimum Corporate Tax\n\nFrance's 2024 Finance Law introduced a 'Pillar 2' minimum level  of  corporate  tax  initially  proposed  in  the  OECD's international  taxation  reform.  This  will  apply  to  Renault  SA from 2024.\n\nIts aim is to establish a global minimum corporate tax rate of 15% by introducing an additional 'top-up tax'.\n\nThe Group is currently examining the implementation of this measure,  paying  particular  attention  to  the  following countries where it does a large amount of business and its corporate  tax  could  be  lower  than  the  minimum  tax  rate: Romania, Malta and Turkey.",

Impairment tests on vehicle-specific assets (including components) and the assets of certain entities\n\nFollowing impairment tests of specific assets dedicated to vehicles  (including  components)  and  assets  belonging  to certain  entities  \u20ac501  million  of  impairment  was  booked  in 2023 in respect of fixed assets (developments, specific tools and vacant buildings), comprising \u20ac285 million for intangible\n\nassets  and  \u20ac216  million  on  tangible  assets.  In  2022, impairment  tests  led  to  recognition  of  \u20ac246  million  of impairment,  comprising  \u20ac(41)  million  for  intangible  assets and \u20ac(205) million for property, plant and equipment.\n\n## 11-B. Impairment test of the Automotive segment cash-generating unit\n\nThe recoverable value used for the purpose of impairment tests  for  the  Automotive  segment  is  the  value  in  use,\n\ndetermined under the discounted future cash flow method on the basis of the following assumptions:\n\n|                         | December 31, 2023   | December 31, 2022   |\n|-------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n| Growth rate to infinity | 1.0%                | 1.0%                |\n| After-tax discount rate | 11.6%               | 11.6%               |\n\nThe assumptions used for impairment testing at December 31, 2023 are derived from the medium-term plan for  the  period  2024-2027,  which  was  presented  in  January 2021,  and  updated  in  late  2023  for  presentation  to  the Leadership  Team.  The  forecasts  include  assumptions  that incorporate  the  negative  effects  of  inflation  and  the worsening of climate risks.\n\nThe growth rates to infinity used in the tests at December 31, 2023 and 2022 include the impacts of commitments made by the States that are signatories to the Paris Agreement on climate change.\n\nAt  December  31,  2023,  no  impairment  was  recognized  on assets  of  the  Automotive  segment  as  a  result  of  the impairment  test,  and  it  was  considered  that  a  reasonably possible  change  in  the  main  assumptions  used  should  not result in a recoverable value lower than the book value of the assets tested.\n\nThe  recoverable  value  of  the  assets  tested  would  remain higher  than  the  book  value  in  the  event  of  the  following changes in those assumptions:\n\n- \u25cf A growth rate to infinity of 0%.\n- \u25cf An after-tax discount rate of 12.5%.\n\n## Note 12 - Investment in Nissan\n\nRenault Group's investment in Nissan in the income statement and financial position:\n\n| (\u20ac million)                                                                 | 2023   | 2022   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Consolidated income statement                                               |        |        |\n| Share in net income (loss) of associates accounted for by the equity method | 797    | 526    |\n| Consolidated financial position                                             |        |        |\n| Investments in associates accounted for by the equity method                | 15,667 | 17,487 |\n\n## 12-A. Nissan consolidation method\n\nOn November 8, 2023, the New Alliance Agreement between Renault  Group  and  Nissan  took  effect.  Under  the  terms  of this  new  agreement,  Renault  transferred  28.4%  of  Nissan shares (out of its 43.4% stake) into a French trust, which will exercise  its  voting  rights  neutrally,  subject  to  certain exceptions.  Renault  Group  continues  to  fully  benefit  from the  economic  rights  (to  dividends  and  proceeds  of  share sales) attached to the Nissan shares held by the trust until\n\nthey are sold. Renault Group may sell the entrusted Nissan shares, but it has no obligation to do so within a specific predetermined  period.  Any  such  sale  must  follow  a  process organized and coordinated with Nissan that gives Nissan or a designated third-party the right of first refusal.\n\nOn December 13, 2023, Renault SA instructed the trust to sell Nissan 211 million of Nissan shares at the price of \u20ac3.62 per share,  giving  a  total  of  \u20ac764  million.

In  the  Renault  Group's  financial  statements,  this rebalancing operation is reflected in a loss of \u20ac(880) million classified  as  Other  operating  income  and  expenses.  This comprises  a  \u20ac(745)  million  loss  on  the  shares,  and  the reclassification of \u20ac(135) million of foreign exchange losses previously included in the translation adjustment reserve.\n\nAs  of  December  31,  2023,  Renault  SA  holds  a  15.8%  interest  in the capital of Nissan. 24.8% is held by the trust of which Renault\n\nSA  is  the  beneficiary.  The  Renault  Group  has  two  seats  on the  Board  of  Directors  of  Nissan  and  is  represented  by Mr.  Jean-Dominique  Senard,  Chairman  of  the  Board,  and Mr. Pierre Fleuriot, lead independent director of Renault Group.\n\nIn view  of  the  above  information,  Renault  Group  is considered  to  exercise  significant  influence  over  Nissan, and  therefore  uses  the  equity  method  to  include  its investment in Nissan in the consolidation.\n\n## 12-B.

Changes in Nissan equity restated for the purposes of the Renault Group consolidation\n\nThe  Nissan  accounts  included  under  the  equity  method  in Renault Group's financial statements are Nissan's consolidated accounts published in compliance with Japanese accounting standards (as Nissan is listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange),  after  adjustments  for  the  requirements  of  the Renault Group consolidation under IFRS standards.\n\nNissan publishes consolidated financial statements quarterly, and annually at March 31. For the purposes of the Renault Group consolidation, Nissan results are included in line  with  the  Renault  Group  calendar  (the  results  for  the period  January  to  December  are  consolidated  in  Renault Group's annual financial statements). Since Nissan's\n\nfinancial  year  ends  at  March  31,  the  Nissan  net  income included in the 2023 Renault Group consolidation is the sum of  Nissan's  net  income  for  the  final  quarter  of  its  2022 financial  year  and  the  first  three  quarters  of  its  2023 financial year.\n\nNissan held 0.5% of its own treasury shares at December 31, 2023  (0.6%  at  December  31,  2022).  Consequently,  Renault SA's  percentage  interest  in  Nissan  is  40.6%  (43.7%  at December 31, 2022). Renault SA held 15% of voting rights in Nissan at December 31, 2023 (43.7% at December 31, 2022).\n\nI",

Valuation of Renault Group's investment in Nissan at stock market prices\n\nBased on the quoted price at December 31, 2023 of \u00a5554 per share,  Renault  Group's  investment  in  Nissan  is  valued  at\n\n\u20ac5,744 million (\u20ac5,444 million at December 31, 2022 based on the price of \u00a5418 per share).\n\n## 12-G. Impairment test of the investment in Nissan\n\nAt  December  31,  2023,  the  stock  market  value  of  the investment  was  63.3%  lower  than  the  value  of  Nissan  in Renault  Group's  statement  of  financial  position  (68.9%  at December 31, 2022).\n\nAn  impairment  test  was  carried  out  at  December  31,  2023 using the following assumptions:\n\n- \u25cf An after-tax discount rate of 8.32% (7.73% at December 31, 2022).\n- \u25cf A growth rate to infinity (including the effect of inflation) of 1.61% (1.42% at December 31, 2022).\n- \u25cf A  terminal  value  was  calculated  under  profitability assumptions  consistent  with  Nissan's  past  data  and conservative medium and long-term prospects, incorporating  new  medium-term  forecasts  for  volumes and exchange rates.\n\nThe test result did not lead to recognition of any impairment on the investment in Nissan at December 31, 2023 and it is considered that a reasonably possible change in the main assumptions used should not result in  a  recoverable  value lower than the book value of the investment in Nissan.\n\n## 12-H. Operations between Renault Group and the Nissan Group\n\nRenault Group and Nissan follow joint strategies for vehicle and  component  development,  purchasing,  production  and distribution  resources.  This  cooperation  is  reflected  in synergies that reduce costs.\n\nThe  Automotive  segment  is  involved  in  operations  with Nissan on two levels:\n\n- \u25cf Industrial  production:  cross-over  production  of  vehicles and components in the Alliance's manufacturing plants:\n- -Sales  by  Renault  Group  to  the  Nissan  Group  in  2023 totalled  approximately  \u20ac1,857  million  (\u20ac2,015  million  in 2022),  comprising  around  \u20ac1,332  million  for  vehicles (\u20ac1,443  million  in  2022),  \u20ac343  million  for  components (\u20ac427  million  in  2022),  and  \u20ac182  million  for  services (\u20ac145 million in 2022).\n- -Purchases  by  Renault  Group  from  the  Nissan  Group  in 2023 totalled approximately \u20ac1,296 million (\u20ac1,564 million in 2022), comprising  around  \u20ac1,158  million  of  vehicles (\u20ac1,200  million  in  2022),  \u20ac88  million  of  components (\u20ac249  million  in  2022),  and  \u20ac50  million  of  services (\u20ac115 million in 2022).\n- -The balance of Renault Group receivables on the Nissan Group is \u20ac595 million at December 31, 2023 (\u20ac504 million at  December  31,  2022)  and  the  balance  of  Renault Group  liabilities  to  the  Nissan  Group  is  \u20ac396  million  at December 31, 2023 (\u20ac500 million at December 31, 2022).\n- \u25cf Finance:  in  addition  to  its  activity  for  Renault  Group, Renault Finance acts as the Nissan Group's counterparty in financial instrument trading to hedge foreign exchange and interest rate risks. Renault Finance undertakes forex transactions on the foreign exchange market for Nissan. Operations undertaken with Nissan on foreign exchange and interest rate derivatives are recorded at market price and  included  in  the  positions  managed  by  Renault Finance. In the balance sheet, the derivative assets on the Nissan group amount to \u20ac21 million at December 31, 2023 (\u20ac188  million  at  December  31,  2022)  and  derivative liabilities  amount  to  \u20ac24  million  at  December  31,  2023 (\u20ac54 million at December 31, 2022).\n\nRenault  Group's  Sales  Financing  segment  helps  to  attract customers and build loyalty to Nissan brands through a range of financing products and services incorporated into the sales policy,  principally  in  Europe.  In  2023,  RCI  Banque  recorded \u20ac102 million of service revenues in the form of commission and interest received from Nissan (\u20ac89 million in 2022). The balance of sales  financing  receivables  on  the  Nissan  Group  is \u20ac45 million at December 31, 2023 (\u20ac34 million at December 31, 2022) and  the  balance  of  liabilities  is \u20ac176 million at December 31, 2023 (\u20ac115 million at December 31, 2022).\n\nThe  Alliance  partners  also  hold  investments  in  associates and joint ventures that manage their cooperation. Details of these  entities'  activity  and  location,  and  Renault  Group's influence over them, are given in Note 13.\n\nI\n\nFinancial statements\n\n05",

Both types of operation are conducted through  special  purpose  vehicles.  Some  public  operations were subscribed by RCI Banque, which makes it possible to have  securities  eligible  as  collateral  for  the  European Central Bank.\n\nDuring  2023  the  Sales  Financing  segment  placed  a \u20ac719 million securitization operation backed by automotive loans  made  by  its  German  branch  (\u20ac700  million  of  senior notes and \u20ac19 million of subordinated notes).\n\nThe Sales Financing segment's French subsidiary also has a new  securitization  programme  for  receivables  on  DIAC leases  with  a  purchase  option.  Under  this  programme,  a public  placement  (the  'Cars  Alliance  Auto  Lease  France  V 2023 -1')  of  approximately  \u20ac737  million  backed  by  lease\n\nrental  receivables  was  issued  (including  \u20ac700  million  of senior notes [\u20ac100 million self-subscribed] and approximately \u20ac37 million of subordinated notes).\n\nThe receivables assigned through such operations are not derecognized,  as  all  risks  are  retained  by  the  Group.  The associated liabilities correspond to securities resulting from the  securitization  operations,  and  are  recognized  in  other debts represented by a certificate.\n\nThe  difference  between  the  receivables  assigned  and  the amount of the associated liabilities corresponds to the higher credit  necessary  for  these  operations,  and  the  share  of securities retained by RCI Banque to form a liquidity reserve.\n\nSecuritized  assets  can  no  longer  be  assigned  or  pledged. Subscribers  to  debt  securities  only  have  claims  on  the assets assigned.\n\nAssets  pledged  as  guarantees  for  management  of  the liquidity reserve are presented in Note 28-A4.\n\nI",

Exposure of Sales Financing to credit risk\n\nThe  maximum  exposure  to  credit  risk  for  the  sales financing activity is represented by the net book value of Sales Financing receivables plus the amount of irrevocable financing commitments for customers reported under offbalance sheet commitments given (Note 28-A). This risk is reduced  by  guarantees  provided  by  customers,  as reported in off-balance sheet commitments received (Note 28-B).  In  particular,  guarantees  held  in  connection  with overdue or impaired sales financing receivables amounted\n\n## Note 16 - Receivables\n\n## Net value of receivables\n\n| (\u20ac million)                                  | December 31, 2023   | December 31, 2022   |\n|----------------------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n| Gross value                                  | 1,578               | 1,799               |\n| Impairment for incurred credit losses  \u207d \u00b9 \u207e | (748)               | (795)               |\n| Impairment for expected credit losses        | (5)                 | (6)                 |\n| NET VALUE                                    | 825                 | 998                 |\n\nThese receivables do not include accounts receivable assigned to  the  Group's  sales  financing  companies  or  other  non-Group entities when substantially all the risks and benefits associated with  ownership  of  the  receivables  are  transferred.  The  risk  of dilution (essentially the risks of non-settlement  after a commercial dispute) is retained by the Group, but is considered negligible.  Receivables  assigned  in  this  way  to  Group  sales financing companies are included in sales financing receivables, principally dealership receivables.\n\nFurthermore,  there  is  no  significant  concentration  of  risks within  the  customer  base  of  the  Automotive  and  Mobility\n\nServices  segments,  and  no  single  external  customer accounts for more than 10% of the total revenues of those segments.\n\nThe  management  policy  for  credit  risk  is  described  in Note 25-B6.\n\nThe  maximum  exposure  to  credit  risk  for  receivables  is represented by the net book value of those receivables.\n\nThe  impairment  model  for  Automotive  receivables  is presented in Note 2-G.\n\nDetails of fair value are given in Note 24-A.\n\nI\n\nto  \u20ac916  million  at  December  31,  2023  (\u20ac784  million  at December 31, 2022).\n\nCustomer  credit  risk  is  assessed  (using  a  scoring  system) and monitored by type of activity (customers and dealers). There  is  no  indication  at  the  year-end  that  the  quality  of Sales Financing receivables not yet due or unimpaired has been  adversely  affected,  nor  is  there  any  significant concentration  of  risks  within  the  sales  financing  customer base as defined by the regulations.\n\n05",

Performance share plans and other share-based payments arrangements\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors  periodically  awards  performance shares to Group executives and managers, with vesting and minimum  holding  periods  specific  to  each  plan.  All  plans include  performance  conditions  which  determine  the number  of  performance  shares  granted  to  beneficiaries. Loss  of  the  benefit  of  performance  shares  follows  the applicable regulations: all rights are forfeited in the event of resignation or termination and a decision is made for each individual case when an employee leaves at the Company's instigation.\n\nDuring  2023  performance  share  plan  30  was  introduced, concerning 1,670 thousand shares with initial total value of \u20ac50 million.

A liability corresponding to these put options is included in other liabilities, amounting to \u20ac109 million for the Brazilian subsidiary, \u20ac10 million for the Argentinian subsidiary, \u20ac15 million for the Czech  subsidiary  and \u20ac25  million  for  the  Colombian  subsidiary  at  December  31, 2023  (\u20ac117  million,  \u20ac4  million,  \u20ac16  million  and  \u20ac49  million respectively at December 31, 2022). A corresponding charge is  made to shareholders' equity, allocated in priority to the non-controlling  interests'  share  with  any  residual  amount allocated  to  the  parent-company  shareholders'  share.  The liability  is  stated  at  fair  value.  Fair  value  is  determined  by estimating the potential purchase price, taking into account future  results  of  the  financing  portfolio  as  it  exists  at  the\n\nclosing date and the provisions of the partnership contracts. This  is  a  level  3  fair  value,  as  it  uses  recognized  models but  their  significant  data  are  not  based  on  observable market data.\n\nPartnership  agreements  were  signed  in  2018  with  Oyak  in Turkey,  including  put  and  call  options  (Note  28-A3).  The Group also holds call options for shares in several entities in the Oyak Group (Note 28-B).\n\nThere are no significant restrictions on the Group's capacity to access or use its assets and settle its liabilities, other than restrictions  that  result  from  the  regulatory  framework  in which  the  subsidiaries  operate.  The  local  supervisory authorities  may  require  banking  subsidiaries  to  keep  a certain level of capital and liquidities, limit their exposure to other group parties, and comply with other ratios.\n\nI",

Pension and benefit plans\n\nPensions and other long-term employee benefit obligations essentially  concern  active  employees.  These  benefits  are covered  either  by  defined-contribution  plans  or  definedbenefit plans.\n\n## Defined-contribution plans\n\nThe Group makes earnings-related payments, in accordance with local custom, to the national organizations responsible  for  paying  pensions  and  similar  financial benefits.  There  is  no  actuarial  liability  concerning  these pension arrangements.\n\nThe total expense  for defined-contribution plans is \u20ac460 million in 2023 (\u20ac516 million in 2022).\n\n## Defined-benefit plans\n\nThe  accounting  treatment  of  defined-benefit  plans  is described  in  Note  2-S  and  involves  establishment  of provisions. These plans concern:\n\n- \u25cf indemnities  payable  upon  retirement  or  departure,  in application  of  legislation  or  agreements  in  certain countries such as France, Turkey, etc;\n- \u25cf supplementary pensions providing employees  with contractual  income;  the  countries  applying  this  type  of plan  are  in  Europe  (e.g.  the  United  Kingdom,  France, Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland, etc);\n- \u25cf other long-term benefits, chiefly long-service awards, and flexible holiday entitlements.\n\nDefined-benefit supplementary pension plans are generally covered  by  contracts  with  pension  funds  or  insurance companies.  In  such  cases,  the  obligations  and  assets  are valued  separately.  The  difference  between  the  obligation and the fair value of the assets held to fund it may indicate underfunding or overfunding. In the event of underfunding, a provision is booked. In the event of overfunding, an asset is recognized subject to certain conditions.\n\nIn France, the contribution period to qualify for a full pension was extended in 2023. This has led to impacts on the Group's retirement indemnity plans because the statutory retirement age is now higher, and also on current career-end work exemption plans. These impacts are recognized in full in the income statement at December 31, 2023.\n\nProvisions  for  pensions  and  other  long-term  employee benefit obligations amount to \u20ac1,208 million at December 31, 2023  (\u20ac1,074  million  at  December  31,  2022),  an  increase  of \u20ac134  million.  The  consequences  of  the  pension  reforms  in France  and  Turkey  are  analyzed  as  a  change  of  plan  and\n\nrecognized in the net income in the financial statements at December 31, 2023 (\u20ac12 million). The financial discount rate most  frequently  used  to  value  the  Group's  obligations  in France is 3.3% at December 31, 2023 (3.74% at December 31, 2022) and the salary increase rate is 2.4% at December 31, 2023 (2.4% at December  31, 2022).\n\n## Principal defined-benefit plans of the Group\n\nIn  France,  the  Group's  retirement  indemnities  result  from agreements  negotiated  with  each  French  entity  and employee  representatives.  They  are  based  on  employees' salaries  and  length  of  service;  payment  is  conditional  on being in the company's employment at the time of retirement. Retirement benefit obligations for France are entirely covered by provisions, and account for most of the Group's liabilities for retirement indemnities. The effects of the new Collective Bargaining Agreement for the Metallurgical  Industry  and  the  new  agreement  governing individual  labor  relations  as  of  January  18,  2024,  applicable to French  industrial  companies,  will  impact  the  2024 fiscal year.\n\nThe Group's most significant supplementary pension plan is in  the  United  Kingdom,  where  two  defined-benefit  pension plans  are  managed  as  part  of  a  dedicated  pension  fund comprising  two  compartments:  one  concerns  Automotive subsidiaries  and  the  other  RCI  Financial  Services  Ltd, together covering 1,705 people. This plan has been closed to new members since 2004, and no further rights have been earned  under  it  since  December  31,  2019.  All  employees benefit  from  a  defined-contribution  pension  plan  from January 1, 2020. Underfunding at December 31, 2023 is valued at  \u00a348  million  for  the  fund  compartment  dedicated  to  the Automotive segment and \u00a34 million for the fund compartment dedicated to RCI Financial Services Ltd.\n\nThis pension fund (a trust) is a legal entity. It is administered by  a  board  of  Trustees  with  equal  representation  for  the participating  companies  and  their  current  and  former employees. The fund is governed by local regulations, which set  the  minimum  funding  requirements  that  can  lead  to additional contributions being made by the Group. After the last  three-yearly  valuation  in  2018,  the  Group  made  a commitment to cover the funding shortfall by 2027 through payments  amounting  to  \u00a35  million  maximum  per  year. The  asset  investment  policy  is  defined  for  each  section  of the  fund  by  a  supervisory  body  which  examines  the performance of investments quarterly. The risks associated with these plans are the usual risks (lower future returns on fund  assets,  a  decline  in  the  equities  markets,  longer  life expectancy for beneficiaries, a rise in inflation, etc).",

Investments in non-controlled entities\n\nAt December 31, 2023, investments in non-controlled entities include an amount of \u20ac34 million (\u20ac33 million at December 31, 2022)  paid  to  the  Funds  for  the  Future  of  the  Automobile (Fonds  Avenir  Automobile)  under  the  support  plan  for\n\nautomobile  industry  suppliers  introduced  by  the  French authorities  and  automakers.  The  outstanding  amount payable by Renault Group at December 31, 2023 is \u20ac77 million (\u20ac84 million at December 31, 2022).\n\n## 22-C. Cash not available to the Group\n\nThe Group has liquidities in countries where repatriation of funds can be complex for regulatory or political reasons. In most  of  these  countries,  such  funds  are  used  locally  for industrial or sales financing purposes.\n\nSome  current  bank  accounts  held  by  the  Sales  Financing Securitization Fund  are  used  to  increase  credit  on\n\nsecuritized receivables, and consequently act as guarantees  in  the  event  of  default  on  payment  of receivables  (Notes  15-B1  et  28-A4).  These  current  bank accounts  amount  to  \u20ac980  million  at  December  31,  2023 (\u20ac1,169 million at December 31, 2022).",

Changes in financial liabilities and sales financing debts\n\n## Changes in redeemable shares of the Automotive segment\n\nThe redeemable shares issued in October 1983 and April 1984 by Renault SA are subordinated perpetual shares listed on the  Paris  Stock  Exchange.  They  earn  a  minimum  annual return of 9% comprising a 6.75% fixed portion and a variable portion  that  depends  on  consolidated  revenues  and  is calculated based on identical Group structure and methods.\n\nRedeemable shares are stated at amortized cost, calculated by discounting the forecast interest coupons at the effective interest rate of the borrowing.\n\nThese  shares  traded  for  \u20ac293.00  at  December  31,  2023 (\u20ac270.58 at December 31, 2022). The financial liability based on  the  stock  market  value  of  the  redeemable  shares  at December  31,  2023  is  \u20ac234  million  (\u20ac216  million at December 31, 2022).\n\n## Changes in bonds and other debts of the Automotive segment\n\nDuring year 2023, bonds repayments amounted to \u20ac1,170 million.\n\n## Change in State-guaranteed credit facility of the Automotive segment\n\nIn 2020, Renault Group opened a credit line with a pool of five banks, for the maximum amount of \u20ac5 billion covered by a French  State  guarantee  for  up  to  90%  of  the  amount borrowed. At December 31, 2020, \u20ac4 billion had been drawn on this credit line.\n\nThe total amount was repaid in half-year 2023.",

It also placed a CHF200 million 5-year  bond  and  undertook  five  \u20ac750  million  bond  issues, with respective maturities of 3, 3.5, 4, 5 and 6 years.\n\nThe  Sales  Financing  segment  had  access  to  the  TLTRO  III program (targeted long-term refinancing operations) set up by  the  European  Central  Bank  (ECB).  Three  drawings  were made during 2020, for a total amount of \u20ac1,750 million that has been redeemed in 2023. Two other drawings were made during 2021, for a total of \u20ac1,500 million, maturing in 2024.\n\nThe interest rate applicable to these financing is calculated based  on  the  average  deposit  facility  rate  'DFR  (Deposit Facility Rate)' of the European Central Bank (ECB).\n\nNew savings collected rose by \u20ac3,735 million during the year (\u20ac594  million  of  sight  deposits  and  \u20ac  3,141  million  of  term deposits) to \u20ac28,176 million (\u20ac18,255 million of sight deposits and  \u20ac9,921  million  of  term  deposits),  and  are  classified  as other interest-bearing borrowings. 89.5% of these deposits are covered by a deposit guarantee scheme at December 31, 2023, compared to 89.2% at December 31, 2022.\n\nTo  hedge  certain  floating-rate  liabilities  (savings  collected and TLTRO financing), the Sales Financing segment set up interest  rate  derivatives  that  do  not  qualify  as  hedging derivatives  under  IFRS  9.  The  operating  income  was\n\nnegatively affected by a \u20ac(118) million increase in the value of these swaps.\n\n## Cash outflows on leases\n\nCash  outflows  on  leases  restated  in  application  of  IFRS  16 amounted  to  \u20ac170  million  in  2023  (\u20ac170  million  in  2022). This  includes  \u20ac142  million  of  repayments  of  the  principal value of lease liabilities (\u20ac148 million in 2022) and \u20ac27 million of interest (\u20ac22 million in 2022).\n\nCash outflows on leases that were reclassified as purchases in substance in application of IAS 16 amounted to \u20ac13 million in  2023  (\u20ac12  million  in  2022).  This  amount  does  not  include repayments of interest.\n\nCash outflows on leases benefiting from the exemption for low-value and very short-term leases amounted  to \u20ac98 million in 2023 (\u20ac93 million in 2022) (Note 5-C).\n\nThe  potential  future  cash  outflows  resulting  from  the exercise of extension options and contracts already signed which  take  effect  after  the  2023  year-end  amount  to \u20ac41 million.\n\n## Changes in financial liabilities of the Mobility Services segment\n\nThe  financial  liabilities  of  the  Mobility  Services  segment consist of internal Group financing issued by Renault SA in the form of interest-bearing loans.\n\nI\n\n05",

Financing by assignment of receivables\n\n## Automotive segment financing by assignment of receivables - financing for the independent dealer network\n\nSome  of  the  Automotive  segment's  external  financing comes from assignment of commercial receivables to nonGroup financial establishments and intragroup assignments  to  the  Sales  Financing  segment.  The  Sales\n\nFinancing  segment  also  contributes  to  the  financing  of inventories sold by the Automotive  segment  to  the independent dealer network.\n\nThe  Group  does  not  undertake  any  non-deconsolidating assignments.\n\nDetails of financing by assignment of commercial receivables and financing of the dealer network by the Sales Financing segment are is as follows:\n\n|                                      | December 31, 2023     | December 31, 2023   | December 31, 2022     | December 31, 2022   |\n|--------------------------------------|-----------------------|---------------------|-----------------------|---------------------|\n| (\u20ac million)                          | To non-group entities | To Sales Financing  | To non-group entities | To Sales Financing  |\n| Assignment of Automotive receivables | 1,698                 | 335                 | 1,555                 | 244                 |\n| Automotive network financing         | -                     | 8,380               | -                     | 7,662               |\n| TOTAL ASSIGNED                       | 1,698                 | 8,715               | 1,555                 | 7,906               |\n\nThe  total amount  of  tax  receivables  assigned  and derecognized in 2023 is \u20ac233 million, comprising \u20ac128 million of  CIR  receivables  and  \u20ac105  million  of  VAT  receivables (\u20ac136  million  of  CIR  receivables  and  \u20ac100  million  of  VAT receivables in 2022).\n\nFrench  tax  receivables  assigned  outside  the  Group  (the 'CIR' Research Tax Credit), with transfer of substantially all the  risks  and  benefits  associated  with  ownership  of  the receivables,  are  only  derecognized  if  the  risk  of  dilution  is deemed to  be  non-existent.  This  is  notably  the  case  when the assigned receivables have already been subject to a tax\n\ninspection or preliminary audit. No assigned tax receivables remained in the balance sheet at December 31, 2023.\n\nThe  assigned  receivables  are  derecognized  when  the associated risks and benefits are substantially transferred, as described in note 2-P.\n\nThe Automotive segment assigns its dealership receivables to  the  Sales  Financing  segment.  The  total  dealership receivables  transferred  to  the  Sales  Financing  segment principally  concerns  Renault  Group.  The  amounts  are presented in Note 15-D.\n\n## Note 24 - Financial instruments by category, fair value and impact on net income\n\n## 24-A. Financial instruments by category and fair values by level\n\nIFRS 9 defines three categories of financial instruments:\n\n- \u25cf financial  assets  or  liabilities  at  fair  value  through  other components of comprehensive income;\n- \u25cf financial  assets  or  liabilities  at  fair  value  through  profit or loss;\n- \u25cf loans and receivables carried at amortized cost.\n\nThe following breakdown by level of fair value is presented for  financial  instruments  carried  in  the  balance  sheet  at fair value:\n\n- \u25cf level  1:  instruments  whose  fair  values  are  derived  from quoted prices in an active market; fair value is generally identical to the most recent quoted price;\n\n- \u25cf level  2:  instruments  whose  fair  values  are  derived  from observable market prices and are not included in level 1;\n- \u25cf level  3:  instruments  whose  fair  values  are  derived  from unobservable  inputs  on  the  market;  the  fair  value  of investments in non-controlled entities is generally based on the share of net assets.\n\nFair values  have  been  determined  on  the  basis  of information  available  at  the  end  of  the  year  and  do  not therefore take account of subsequent movements.\n\nIn 2023, no financial instruments were transferred between level 1 and level 2, or into or out of level 3.",

Changes in Level 3 financial instruments\n\nLevel 3 financial instruments correspond to Sales Financing receivables (\u20ac49,615 million at December 31, 2023, \u20ac44,247  million  at  December  31,  2022),  loans  and  other (\u20ac1,168 million  at  December  31,  2023,  \u20ac684  million  at December  31,  2022),  investments  in  non-controlled  entities (\u20ac65  million  at  December  31,  2023  and  \u20ac63  million  at December 31, 2022) and certain cash equivalents, essentially\n\nterm deposits (Note 22-A). These financial assets remain at historical  cost.  Investments  in  non-controlled  entities  also remain at historical cost, but in an exception to the general approach, if historical cost is inappropriate they are valued on  the  basis  of  the  share  of  net  equity  or  using  a  method based on non-observable data.",

Management of financial risks\n\nThe Group is exposed to the following financial risks:\n\n- \u25cf Liquidity risk;\n- \u25cf Market risks (foreign exchange, interest rate, equity and commodity risks);\n- \u25cf Bank  counterparty  risk  and  credit  risk  on  customer  and dealer financing.\n\n## 25-B1. Liquidity risk\n\nThe Group must have sufficient financial resources to finance its automotive  and  sales  financing  businesses  and  the investments  necessary  for  their  growth.  To  ensure  this  is  the case, the Automotive and Sales Financing segments borrow on the capital and banking markets to refinance their gross debt and guarantee liquidity. This exposes them to liquidity risks if markets are closed for long periods or credit is hard to access. The Automotive and Sales Financing segments are also creditrated by several agencies. Any downgrading of external credit ratings could limit and/or increase the cost of their access to the capital markets.\n\n## Liquidity risks - Automotive segment\n\nThe Automotive segment's liquidity risk is managed by the Financing  and  Treasury  department.  It  is  founded  on  an internal model that defines the level of the liquidity reserve the  Automotive  segment  must  maintain  to  finance  their operations and development. The liquidity reserve is closely monitored  by  a  monthly  review  and  reported  to  the  Chief Financial Officer.\n\nRenault  SA  handles  most  refinancing  for  the  Automotive segment  through  long-term  resources  via  the  capital markets  (bond  issues  and  private  placements),  short-term financing such as NEU CP (Negotiable European Commercial  Paper),  or  bank  financing.  Renault  SA  has several debt programs at December 31, 2023:\n\n- \u25cf An  EMTN  bond  program  with  a  \u20ac10  billion  ceiling.  This program has been registered with the AMF;\n- \u25cf A  Shelf  Registration  bond  program  on  the  Japanese market with a \u00a5400 billion ceiling. This program has been registered  with  the  Japanese  stock  market  authorities (Kanto Local Finance Bureau);\n- \u25cf A NEU CP program with a \u20ac2.5 billion ceiling. This program has been registered with the Bank of France.\n\nRenault  SA  and  its  debt  programs  are  credit-rated  by several  agencies.  On  February  20,  2023,  S&P  upgraded  the outlook from negative to stable while maintaining the rating at  BB+.  On  August  2,  2023  Moody's  upgraded  the  rating  to Ba1 with a stable outlook. The Japanese ratings agency R&I upgraded  the outlook from negative to stable on March 22, 2023 while maintaining the rating at A-, and JCR confirmed  the  rating  of  A-  with  a  stable  outlook  on November 22, 2022.\n\nRenault  SA  maintained  its  access  to  short-term  financing through use of its NEU CP (Negotiable European Commercial Paper) program.\n\nRisk  management  differs  depending  on  the  operating segment. The risks described below concern the Automotive segment  and  the  Sales  Financing  segment.  The  Mobility Services segment does not have any specific financial risks since it is financed by the Automotive segment.\n\nIn  2023,  Renault  SA  reimbursed  \u20ac990  million  (Note  23-C)  of the bank  credit facility guaranteed  by  the  French government. This credit facility was set up in 2020 to cover liquidity requirements resulting from the Covid-19 pandemic and  three  drawings  totalling  \u20ac4  billion  were  made  on  it during the second half-year of 2020. This State-guaranteed facility was fully repaid at December 31, 2023.\n\nRenault SA also has confirmed credit lines opened with banks worth  \u20ac3,310  million  at  December  31,  2023  (3,430  million December 31, 2022). These credit lines mature in more than one year and were undrawn at December 31, 2023 (and 2022). They form  a  liquidity  reserve  for  the  Automotive  segment.  The maturities  of  the  Automotive  segment's  financial  liabilities  at December 31, 2023 are presented in Note 23-D.\n\nThe  contractual  documentation  for  Renault  SA's  confirmed credit  arrangements,  bank  loans  and  market  financing  does not contain any clause that could affect the continued supply of credit as a result of changes in either Renault Group's credit rating  or  its  financial  ratios.  Certain  types  of  financing, particularly  market  financing,  contain  standard  clauses  (pari passu, negative pledge and cross-default clauses).\n\nAt  December  31,  2023,  the  Automotive  segment  have  a liquidity  reserve  of  \u20ac17.8  billion,  sufficient  to  cover  their commitments over a 12-month horizon. This reserve consists of \u20ac14.5 billion of cash and cash equivalents, and \u20ac3.31 billion of unused confirmed credit lines.\n\n## Liquidity risks - Sales Financing segment\n\nThe Sales Financing segment  is very attentive to diversification of its sources of liquidity and moving into new distribution  zones  in  addition  to  its  longstanding  base  of Euro bond investors.\n\nThe  Sales  Financing  segment's  liquidity  risk  management follows  the  recommendations  of  the  European  Banking Authority.  It  uses  several  indicators  and  analyzes  (liquidity reserve, transfer prices and several stress scenarios), which are  updated  and  reported  to  Sales  Financing  segment's Financial  Committee  on  a  monthly  basis.  The  stress scenarios include assumptions concerning deposit leakage, loss  of  access  to  new  financing,  partial  unavailability  of certain  elements  of  the  liquidity  reserve  and  forecasts  for issuance of new credit.\n\nThe alternation of different maturities and issue formats is part  of  the  Sales  Financing  segment's  diversification strategy for financing sources. This policy has been followed for  several  years  and  enables  the  segment  to  reach  the maximum number of investors.\n\nI",

These included the segment's second green bond issue, made in 2023 in the value of \u20ac750 million.\n\nOn the securitization market, the Sales Financing segment placed  two  public  operations  during  2023.  The  first  was  a \u20ac719  million  placement  backed  by  automotive  loans  made by its German subsidiary, and the second was a \u20ac737 million placement  (including  \u20ac100  million  self-subscribed)  backed by  receivables  on  lease  contracts  with  a  purchase  option issued  by  DIAC  in  France.  The  revolving  period  of  private securitizations  of  automotive  loans  in  the  United  Kingdom, leasing  receivables  in  Germany  and  the  residual  value component  of  receivables  on  lease  contracts  with  a purchase option in France was extended for a further year, and  the  amounts  of  these  operations  were  raised  to \u00a3600 million in the United Kingdom, \u20ac400 million in Germany, and \u20ac400 million in France.\n\n## 25-B2. Foreign exchange risk\n\nThe Group made no major changes to its foreign exchange risk management policy in 2023.\n\nThe  Group's  exposure  to  foreign  exchange  risk  principally concerns the Automotive segment.\n\n## Foreign exchange risks - Automotive segment\n\nIn  the  Automotive segment, fluctuations in exchange rates can  affect  the  following  financial  aggregates:  operating income  (loss),  financial  income  (expenses),  share  in  net income (loss) of associates and joint ventures, shareholders' equity and net cash position.\n\nThe Performance  and  Control  Department  and  the Financing and Treasury Department are in charge of rolling out  and  monitoring  the  Automotive  segment's  foreign exchange risk management policy.\n\nCollection of new savings was vigorous and competitive in terms of the cost of resources collected. Customer deposits increased by \u20ac3.8 billion over the year to \u20ac28.2 billion.\n\nWith  these  resources,  as  well  as  \u20ac4.4  billion  of  undrawn confirmed  credit  lines  with  banks,  \u20ac5.4  billion  of  collateral eligible  for  the  Central  Banks'  monetary  policy  operations, \u20ac4.6  billion  of  highly  liquid  assets  (HQLA),  Sales  financing segment  is  able  to  maintain  its  customer  financing  for 12 months without access to external liquidities. At  December  31,  2023,  Sales  financing  segment's  liquidity reserve  (for  the  Europe  scope)  amounts  to  \u20ac14.6  billion (\u20ac14.9 billion at December 31, 2022).\n\nThe  Sales  Financing  segment's  issues  and  programs  are credit-rated by several agencies. In 2023, S&P confirmed RCI Banque's rating of BBB- with a stable outlook, while Moody's upgraded  the  rating  to  Baa1  with  a  stable  outlook  on August 4 th , 2023.\n\n## Operating income\n\nThe Automotive segment sometimes hedges certain positions. Foreign exchange hedges on operating income and expenses must  first  be  analyzed  by  the  Performance  and  Control Department and the Financing and Treasury Department, and then require formal authorization by the Chief Financial Officer or Chief Executive Officer, with monthly reporting of results to the Chief Finance Officer. Wherever possible, foreign exchange  operations  are  mainly  undertaken  by  the  Group's trading  room  (Renault  Finance)  for  currencies  that  are negotiable on the international markets.\n\nThe  principal  exposure  to  foreign  exchange  risks  lies  in  the operating  income  (loss).  At  December  31,  2023  based  on  the 2023 structure of operating results and cash flows, a 1% rise by the euro against all other currencies would  have  an unfavourable  impact  of  \u20ac9  million  on  the  Automotive segment's annual operating income (loss) after any hedging.\n\nIn  2023,  to  limit  the  foreign  exchange  exposure  of  its operating  margin,  the  Automotive  segment  arranged foreign  exchange  hedges  on  the  Argentinian  peso,  the Chinese yuan and the Turkish lira.",

If  a  subsidiary  needs  external financing  in  a  currency  other  than  the  local  currency,  the parent  company  monitors  the  operations  closely.  Cash surpluses  in  countries  that  are  not  part  of  the  parent company's  centralized  cash  management  are  generally invested  in  local  currency,  under  the  supervision  of  the Group's Financing and Treasury Department. The subsidiary Renault Finance can undertake foreign exchange operations  on  its  own  behalf,  within  strictly  defined  risk limits.  Its  foreign  exchange  positions  are  monitored  and valued  in  real  time.  This  activity  is  chiefly  intended  to maintain the Group's expertise on the financial markets. It generates very short exposures and does not exceed a few tens of millions of euros, so that it cannot have a significant impact on Renault Group's consolidated results.\n\n## Share in the net income of associates and joint ventures\n\nThe share in the net income of associates and joint ventures is  exposed  to  foreign  exchange  risks.  On  the  basis  of  its contribution to 2023 net income, a 1% rise in the euro against the Japanese yen would have decreased Nissan's contribution by \u20ac8 million. This impact corresponds only to the  impact  of  the  euro  on  the  translation  of  Nissan's contribution to the Renault Group's consolidated statements. It does not reflect the inherent impact of euro fluctuations  on  Nissan's  own  accounts,  given  that  Nissan does varying levels of business in the Euro zone and Renault Group has no control over this.\n\n## Equity investments\n\nThe  foreign  exchange  risk  exposure  of  equity  investments  (in currencies  other  than  the  euro)  is  not  generally  hedged. However,  due  to  its  importance,  the  investment  in  Nissan  is subject  to  a  partial  foreign  exchange  hedge  amounting  to \u00a5199.9 billion at December 31, 2023 (\u00a5199.9 billion at December 31, 2022)  (Note  12-E).  In  2022  the  Group  amended  its  management rule restricting hedging of its net investment in Nissan to its best estimate  of  the  next  three  years  of  dividends  in  yen  to  be received  from  Nissan.  The  Group  can  now  decide  to  hedge  a higher amount of its exposure to foreign exchange risks through the  share  of  equity  held  in  Nissan  than  the  above  estimate, although it cannot exceed the share in yen of Nissan equity and its  assessment  of  the  liquidity  risk  on  the  yen.  This  foreign currency hedge is only a limited part of the investment in Nissan.\n\n## Net cash position\n\nFor  the  purposes  of  the  partial  hedge  of  the  investment  in Nissan,  some  of  Renault  Group's  net  financial  indebtedness  is denominated in yen. At December 31, 2023 a 1% rise in the euro against  the  yen  would  increase  the  net  cash  position  of  the Automotive segment by \u20ac13 million. This net cash position may also  be  impacted  by  changes  in  exchange  rates  concerning subsidiaries' financial assets and liabilities in their local currency.\n\n## Analysis of financial instruments' sensitivity to foreign exchange risks\n\nThis  analysis  concerns  the  sensitivity  to  foreign  exchange risks of monetary assets and liabilities (including intra-Group balances)  and  derivatives  denominated  in  a  currency  other than  the  currency  of  the  entity  that  holds  them.  However,  it does  not  cover  items  (hedged  assets  or  liabilities  and derivatives)  concerned  by  fair  value  hedging,  for  which changes  in  fair  value  of  the  hedged  item  and  the  hedging instrument totally offset each other in the income statement.\n\nThe impact on shareholders' equity (before tax) of a 1% rise in the  euro  against  other  currencies  is  assessed  by converting  financial  assets,  cash  flow  hedges  and  the\n\nI",

For  the Automotive segment,  this  impact  would  be  a  favourable \u20ac13 million at December 31, 2023 (\u20ac14 million at December 31, 2022),  explained  by  the  yen  bond  issues  that  make  up  the partial hedge of the investment in Nissan (Note 12-E).\n\nThe  impact  on  net  income  of  a  1%  rise  in  the  euro  against other  currencies  would  be  an  unfavourable  impact  of \u20ac9 million at December 31, 2023 (\u20ac5 million at December 31, 2022), mainly attributable to unhedged operating assets and liabilities denominated  in  a  currency  that  is  not  the functional currency of the entity that holds them.\n\n## Foreign exchange risk - Sales Financing segment\n\nThe  Sales  Financing  segment  has  low  exposure  to  foreign exchange risks due to the management principles applied.\n\n## 25-B3. Interest rate risks\n\nThe Group made no major changes to its interest rate risk management policy in 2023.\n\nThe  Group's  exposure  to  interest  rate  risk  principally concerns the Sales Financing segment.\n\n## Interest rate risk - Automotive segment\n\nThe Automotive segment's net financial income is exposed to  a  risk  of  variations  in  market  interest  rates  affecting  its cash  surpluses  and  financial  liabilities,  and  to  a  lesser degree its shareholders' equity.\n\nThe  interest  rate  risk  management  policy  applies  the following principles:\n\n- \u25cf Liquidity reserves are generally established using floating-rate financing. The Automotive segment's available cash is managed centrally by Renault SA as far as possible and invested by Renault Finance in the form of short term bank deposits and mutual funds approved as money  market  funds  and  meeting  the  criteria  for classification as cash equivalents\n- \u25cf Long-term  investments  by  the  Automotive  segment generally use fixed-rate financing\n\nInterest rate hedging instruments for the Automotive segment are  standard  interest  swaps  that  are  adequately  covered  by hedged liabilities, such that no ineffectiveness is expected.\n\nFinally, Renault Finance carries out interest rate transactions  on  its  own  behalf,  within  strictly  defined  risk limits,  and  positions are monitored and valued in real time. The  risk  associated  with  this  arbitrage  activity  is  very limited,  and  has  no  significant  impact  on  the  Group's consolidated net income.\n\n## Interest rate risk - Sales Financing segment\n\nThe  overall  interest  rate  risk  represents  the  impact  of fluctuating rates on the future gross financial margin. Sales Financing segment's operating results may be affected by movements  in  market  interest  rates  or  interest  rates\n\nNo  position  can  be  taken  under  the  central  management framework  for  refinancing;  the  trading  room  hedges  all flows  concerned.  Residual,  temporal  positions  in  foreign currencies  related  to  the  time  differences  in  cash  flows inherent  to  multi-currency  cash  management  may  still remain.  They  are  monitored  daily  and  the  same  hedging policy applies. The Sales Financing subsidiaries are obliged to  obtain  refinancing  in  their  own  currency  and  as  a  result are  not  exposed.  In  exceptional  circumstances,  limits  are assigned to subsidiaries where sales financing activities or refinancing take place in several different currencies, and to subsidiaries  authorized  to  invest  some  of  their  cash surpluses in a currency other than their local currency.\n\n- At December 31, 2023 Sales Financing segment's consolidated foreign exchange position reached \u20ac17.9 million.\n\napplicable  to  customer  deposits.  The  Sales  Financing segment's  aim  is  to  limit  these  risks  as  far  as  possible  in order to protect its margin on sales.\n\nTo take account of the difficulty of precisely matching the structure of borrowings with the structure of loans, a limited amount of flexibility is allowed in each subsidiary's interest rate hedging. This flexibility is reflected in a sensitivity limit assigned  to  each  subsidiary  and  validated  by  the  finance committee,  in  an  individual  adaptation  of  part  of  the  limit Renault Group assigns to the Sales Financing segment.\n\nA daily sensitivity calculation by currency, management entity, and asset portfolio is used to ensure that each entity respects its assigned limits. All Sales Financing segment entities use the same method for this  assessment  of  interest  rate  sensitivity, which  measures  the  impact  of  a  100  base  point  increase  in interest  rates  on  the  value  of  balance  sheet  items  for  each entity.  Sensitivity  is  calculated  daily  for  each  currency  and each  management  entity  (central  refinancing  office,  French and  foreign  sales  financing  subsidiaries)  for  the  purpose  of overall management  of  interest  rate  risks  across  the consolidated scope of the Sales Financing segment.\n\nEach entity's position with regard to its limit is checked daily, and  immediate  hedging  directives  are  issued  to  the subsidiaries  if  circumstances  require.  The  results  of  the checks  are  reported  monthly  to  the  Sales  Financing segment's  Finance  Committee,  which  checks  that  the positions  comply  with  the  Group's  financial  strategy  and current procedural instructions.\n\nAnalysis of the Sales Financing segment's structural interest rate risk shows the following:\n\n- \u25cf Virtually  all  loans  to  customers  by  Sales  Financing subsidiaries bear interest at a fixed rate and have terms from one to seventy-two months. These loans are hedged by fixed-rate resources with the same structure. They are covered by macro-hedging and only generate a residual interest  rate  risk.  In  subsidiaries  where  the  financing bears  interest  at  a  floating  rate,  the  interest  rate  risk  is hedged by macro-hedging using interest rate swaps.",

The  outstanding  credit issued by Sales Financing subsidiaries is backed by fixedinterest  resources,  some  of  which  are  micro-hedged  by interest  rate  swaps,  and  floating-rate  resources.  Macrohedging  transactions  in  the  form  of  interest  rate  swaps keep the sensitivity of the refinancing Holding company below  the  limit  set  by  the  Group  (\u20ac32  million).  These macro-hedging transactions concern floating-rate resources  and/or  fixed-rate  resources  converted  to floating-rate resources by micro-hedging of swaps.\n\n## Analysis of Group financial instruments' sensitivity to interest rate risks\n\nThe Automotive and Sales Financing segments are exposed to the following interest rate risks:\n\n- \u25cf variations in the interest flows on floating-rate financial instruments  stated  at  amortized  cost  (including  fixedrate instruments swapped  to  floating rate, and structured products);\n- \u25cf variations  in the fair value  of  fixed-rate  financial instruments stated at fair value;\n- \u25cf variations in the fair value of derivatives.\n\nImpacts are estimated by applying a 100 base point rise in interest rates over a one-year period to financial instruments  reported  in  the  closing  statement  of  financial position.\n\nFor the Sales Financing segment, the impact on shareholders' equity corresponds to the change in fair value before  reclassification  in  profit  or  loss  of  fixed-rate  debt instruments  classified  as  financial  assets  at  fair  value through  other  components  of  comprehensive  income  and cash flow hedges after a 100 base point rise in interest rates. All other impacts affect net income.\n\nCalculation of the individual segments' sensitivity to interest rates includes intersegment loans and borrowings.\n\nFor the Automotive segment, the impact on net income of a 100  base  point  rise  in  interest  rates  applied  to  financial instruments  exposed  to  interest  rate  risks  would  be  a favourable  \u20ac122.1  million.  Shareholders'  equity  would  be unaffected.\n\nFor  the  Sales  Financing  segment,  the  overall  sensitivity  to interest  rate  risks  in  2023  remained  below  the  limit  set  by Sales Financing segment (\u20ac70 million at December 31, 2023). At December 31, 2023, a 100 base point rise in interest rates would  have  the  following  impacts  on  net  income  and shareholders' equity (before taxes):\n\n- \u25cf +\u20ac 1.6 million for items denominated in Swiss francs,\n- \u25cf +\u20ac1.2 million for items denominated in Moroccan dirham ,\n- \u25cf +\u20ac 1.2 million for items denominated in Colombian pesos,\n- \u25cf \u20ac (1.5) million for items denominated in euros,\n- \u25cf \u20ac (3.2) million for items denominated in pounds sterling,\n- \u25cf \u20ac (4.1) million for items denominated in Polish zloty.\n\nThe  sum  of  the  absolute  sensitivities  in  each  currency amounts to \u20ac 16.9 million.\n\nI\n\n05",

Equity risk\n\nThe Group's exposure to equity risks has been marginal.\n\n## 25-B5. Commodity risk\n\n## Management of commodity risk\n\nCommodity  purchase  prices  can  change  suddenly  and significantly,  and  cannot  necessarily  be  passed  on  through vehicle  sale  prices.  This  may  lead  Renault  Group's  Purchases department  to  hedge  part  of  its  commodity  risks  using\n\nfinancial  instruments.  These  hedges  are  subject  to  volume, duration, and price limits. The subsidiary Renault Finance can undertake  metal  operations  on  its  own  behalf,  within  strictly defined risk limits. Its positions are monitored and valued in real time and do not qualify as hedging. This activity cannot have a significant impact on Renault Group's consolidated results.",

Bank counterparty risk and credit risk on customer and dealer financing\n\n## Customer credit risk on Automotive receivables\n\nThe Automotive segment's exposure to credit risk is limited because of the assignment of many receivables leading to their  deconsolidation,  and  systematic  hedging  of  risks  on export  receivables.  Non-assigned  sales  receivables  and receivables covered by guarantee are regularly monitored.\n\n## Credit risk on customers, dealers and commitments given by the Sales Financing segment\n\nCredit  risk  is  closely  linked  to  macro-economic  factors including  the  unemployment  rate,  corporate  bankruptcies, debt servicing costs, revenue growth, disposable household income,  dealership  profitability  and  the  price  of  used vehicles. It has a significant impact on the Sales Financing segment's business.\n\nThe Sales Financing segment uses advanced credit scoring systems and external databases to evaluate the quality of loans  made  to  retail  and  business  customers.  The  Group also  uses  an  internal  rating  system  to  evaluate  lending  to dealers. Although the Sales Financing segment is constantly adjusting  its  acceptance  policy  in  response  to  market conditions, any increase in the credit risk would increase its cost  of  risk  and  its  provisions  for  bad  debt.  It  has  detailed procedures to recover receivables that are compromised or in  default,  arranging  repossessions  and  sales  of  unpaid vehicles.  However,  there  can  be  no  guarantee  that  the policies  for  issuing  credit,  monitoring  credit  risk,  payment recovery action, and repossession of vehicles are, or will be, sufficient  to  avoid  an  unfavourable  impact  on  its  financial results and position.\n\nAn increase in the credit risk would increase the cost of risk and  provisions  for  bad  debt,  with  a  direct  impact  on  the Sales Financing segment's financial results and potentially on its internal capital.\n\n## Bank counterparty risk\n\nDue to its operations on the financial markets to invest cash surpluses, manage foreign exchange risks and interest risks, and manage payment flows, the Group is exposed to a bank counterparty risk.\n\nThis  bank  counterparty  risk  affecting  Group  entities  is managed  by  both  the  Automotive  and  Sales  Financing segment in a fully-coordinated approach. It is founded on an internal  rating  system  based  mainly  on  counterparties' long-term credit ratings and equity. This system is used by all Renault Group companies exposed to a bank counterparty risk.\n\nGroup companies which, due to the nature of their business, are  significantly  exposed  to  a  bank  counterparty  risk  are monitored daily to ensure that they comply with authorized counterparty limits, in accordance with specific procedures. The Group produces a consolidated monthly report covering all  its  bank  counterparties,  organized  by  credit  rating.  This report provides a detailed analysis of compliance with limits in terms of amount, maturity and type, as well as a list of the main exposures.\n\nTo  reduce  the  bank  counterparty  risk,  most  deposits  are contracted  with  large  network  banks  and  generally  have terms shorter than 90 days, as this allows a good spread of the  risk.  In  the  event  of  volatile  macroeconomic  situations that may arise in emergent countries and potentially affect their banking systems, the Group introduces an action plan to step  up  counterparty  risk  monitoring,  and  makes adjustments  to  the  counterparty  limits  if  necessary.  The exposure on each banking group is assessed monthly on a consolidated basis, with the Automotive and Sales Financing  entities.  The  Group  is  not  subject  to  any significant  risk  concentration  for  its  operations  on  the financial and banking markets.\n\nNo  losses  due  to  default  by  a  bank  counterparty  were recorded in 2023. The bank counterparty risk borne by the Group  through  its  shares  in  investment  funds  (UCITS)  is incorporated  into  the  risk  of  changes  in  value  for  those products, and monitored using specific rules.\n\nI\n\n05",

The maximum  payable  within  one  year  is  \u20ac244  million  at December  31,  2023  (\u20ac485  million  at  December  31,  2022).\n\n## 28-A2. Contingent liabilities\n\nGroup companies are periodically subject to tax inspections in  the  countries  in  which  they  operate.  Accepted  tax adjustments  are  recorded  as  provisions  in  the  financial statements. Contested tax adjustments are recognized on a case-by-case  basis,  taking  into  account  the  risk  that  the proceedings  or  appeals  undertaken  may  be  unsuccessful. Tax liabilities are recognized via provisions when there are uncertainties over the determination of taxes.\n\nOn December 19, 2019 Renault sas received notification of a tax  reassessment  on  transfer  prices  in  2016,  and  an additional  notification  was  received  on  June  24,  2021 concerning the years 2017 and 2018. In December, 2022, the French tax authorities issued a proposed reassessment for the  year  2019  relating  to  a  further  inspection  covering  the period  2019-2020.  In  July  2023,  the  French  tax  authorities addressed  a  proposed  reassessment  for  the  year  2020 relating to a further inspection  covering  the  period 2019-2020. Renault Group is challenging the most significant amounts of these notifications,  and  no  provision  has  been recognized in the financial statements at December 31, 2023 in connection with this matter (nor at December 31, 2022).\n\nRESA  (Renault  Espa\u00f1a  SA)  was  notified  in  late  2020  of  a \u20ac213 million tax reassessment for transfer prices concerning the years 2013 to 2016 and of a \u20ac84 million tax reassessment for  transfer  prices  in  June  2023  concerning  the  years  2017 and  2019.  No  provision  has  been  recognized  in  connection with this notification, since Renault Group considers that it has  good  chances  of  winning  its  case.  A  procedure  for amicable  settlement  between  France  and  Spain  began  in 2021.  A  deposit  of  \u20ac213  million  was  paid  to  the  Spanish  tax authorities  (\u20ac135  million  in  2020  and  \u20ac78  million  in  2021), recognized in non-current financial assets.\n\nDisposals of subsidiaries or businesses by the Group generally include  representations  and  warranties  in  the  buyer's  favour. At  December  31,  2023,  the  Group  has  not  identified  any significant risk in connection with these operations.\n\nGroup companies are periodically subject to investigations by  the  authorities  in  the  countries  in  which  they  operate. When  the  resulting  financial  consequences  are  accepted, they  are  recognized  in  the  financial  statements  via provisions. When they are contested, they are recognized on a  case-by-case  basis,  based  on  estimates  that  take  into account the risk that the proceedings or appeals undertaken may be unsuccessful.\n\nThe main investigations by the competition and automotive regulation  authorities  in  progress  at  December  31,  2023 concern  illegal  agreements  and  the  level  of  vehicle emissions in Europe.\n\nIn the ongoing 'emissions' affair in France, in which a formal legal  investigation  was  opened  on  January  12,  2017  at  the request  of  the  Paris  public  prosecution  office,  Renault  sas was  officially  placed  under  investigation  for  deceit  on June 8, 2021.\n\nIrrevocable  commitments  at  December  31,  2023  were essentially made to secure raw material and battery supplies for electric vehicles.\n\nIn July 2021 Renault Group paid bail of \u20ac20 million (included in the balance sheet) to guarantee  its representation throughout  the  proceedings  and  to  cover  payment  of  any damages  and  fines.  It  also  issued  a  \u20ac60  million  bank guarantee on October 8, 2021 to cover compensation for any prejudice identified. Renault Group denies having committed any offence. All Renault Group vehicles are, and always  have  been,  type-approved  in  accordance  with applicable laws and regulations. The potential consequences  of  the  next  steps in these ongoing proceedings cannot be reliably estimated, and no provision was  recognized in connection with this matter at December 31, 2023 (nor at December 31, 2022 and 2021).\n\nGroup's  sales  are  subject  to  CO2  emission  regulations, principally  in  the  European  Union  but  also  notably  in  the United Kingdom, South Korea, Brazil and India.\n\nIn  2020, 2021 and 2022, the three members of the Alliance Renault,  Nissan  and  Mitsubishi  Motors  Corp.  -  signed agreements  to  pool  their  CAFE  (Corporate  Average  Fuel Economy)  targets  for  the  European  Union.  The  potential noncompliance  penalties payable to the authorities concerned are determined at the level of the group formed by  the  Alliance's  three  automakers.  Renault  did  not recognise  any  provision  in  connection  with  the  EU  CAFE regulation at December 31, 2023 (nor at December 31, 2022).\n\nA provision of \u20ac4 million was recognized for CAFE penalties payable for 2023 in South Korea (\u20ac10 million in 2022), raising the total provision for the years 2019 to 2023 to \u20ac47 million.\n\nGroup  companies  are  also  subject  to  the  applicable regulations  regarding  pollution,  notably  of  soil  and  ground water. These regulations vary depending on the country of location.  Some  of  the  associated  environmental  liabilities are potential and will only be recognized in the accounts if the  activity  is  discontinued  or  the  site  closed.  It  is  also sometimes  difficult  to  determine  the  amount  of  the obligation  reliably.  Provisions  are  only  established  for liabilities that  correspond  to  a  legal  or  constructive obligation  at  the  closing  date,  and  can  be  estimated  with reasonable reliability.\n\nThe  Group  establishes  provisions  for  product  recycling under regulatory requirements, when the practical organization  of  recycling  operations  is  defined.  France's 'AGEC' law of February 10, 2020 to fight waste and promote a  circular  economy  aims  to  extend  industrial  operators' legal responsibility for management of their waste. Renault Group has applied for accreditation to operate an individual system  for  management  of  end-of-life  vehicles  (ELVs)  to meet all its recycling obligations for Renault vehicles on the road  in  France,  and  a  study  is  in  process  to  determine whether these obligations will be onerous.\n\nOn  March  15,  2022,  the  European  Commission  conducted inspections at the premises of companies and associations active  in  the  automotive  sector  located  in  several  EU",

In parallel,  the  European  Commission sent out  formal  requests  for  information  to  several  companies active in the automotive sector. The investigation concerns possible anticompetitive collusion in relation to the collection, treatment and recovery of end-of-life (ELV) cars and  vans,  relating  in  particular  to  (i)  the  compensation  of ELV collection, treatment, and recovery companies, and (ii) the use of data relating to the recyclability or recoverability of ELVs in advertising materials.\n\n## 28-A3. Share purchase commitments given\n\nWhen the Group grants put options to minority shareholders to sell their investments in fully consolidated companies, a liability corresponding to the option is recognized, with a reduction in shareholders' equity - non-controlling interests' share.\n\nPut options granted by the Group to minority shareholders concern Banco RCI Brasil SA, Rombo Compania Financiera, RCI Colombia SA and RCI Financial Services s.r.o. The  consequences  for  the  financial  statements  are explained in Note 18-H.\n\nPartnership  agreements  were  signed  in  2018  with  Oyak  in Turkey, including perfectly symmetrical put and call options for non-controlling  investments,  entitling  Renault  sas,\n\nRenault  was  one  of  the  companies  visited  on  March  15, 2022.  In  parallel,  Renault  has  received  a  request  for information  from  the  UK  Competition  and  Markets Authority  (CMA),  which  is  investigating  similar  conduct. Renault has replied to the European Commission's and the CMA's requests for information.\n\nThe  possible  consequences  of  the  ongoing  investigation cannot be reliably estimated at this stage and no provision in connection  with  this  matter  has  been  recorded  at December 31, 2023.\n\nsubject to certain conditions, to purchase Oyak's shares in Oyak Renault (call)  and  to  sell  its  shares  in  MAIS  (put),  and entitling  Oyak  to  sell  its  shares  in  Oyak  Renault  (put)  and purchase  Renault  sas's  shares  in  MAIS  (call).  The  exercise price  for  the  put  option,  if  exercised,  will  be  determined  by three independent experts who would be appointed at the exercise date. Analysis of the contracts did not identify any circumstances  beyond  the  control  of  Renault  Group  that could  lead  to  Oyak's  put  option  exercised  without  Renault Group  being  able  to  object.  Consequently,  no  liability  was recognized  at  December  31,  2023  or  December  31,  2022  in connection with these options.\n\n## 28-A4. Assets pledged as guarantees for management of the liquidity reserve\n\nFor management of its liquidity reserve, the Sales Financing segment has access to  the  monetary  policy  operations  of the  European Central Bank (ECB) and the Bank of England (BOE).To  benefit  from  European  Central  Bank  monetary policy operations, the segment has provided guarantees to the  Banque  de  France  (under  France's  central  collateral management system 3G - Gestion Globale des Garanties) in the  form  of  assets  with  book  value  of  \u20ac8,252  million  at December  31,  2023  (\u20ac8,907  million  at  December  31,  2022). These assets comprise \u20ac7,072 million of shares in securitization vehicles and \u20ac1,180 million of Sales Financing receivables  (\u20ac7,647  million  of  shares  in  securitization vehicles and \u20ac1,260 million of Sales Financing receivables at\n\nDecember 31, 2022). The financing provided by the Banque de France against these guarantees amounts to \u20ac1,850  million  at  December  31,  2023  (\u20ac3,250  million  at December  31,  2022).  To  benefit  from  Bank  of  England monetary  policy  operations,  the  Sales  Financing  segment has  provided  guarantees  to  the  Bank  of  England's  TFSME (Term Funding Scheme for SMEs) in the form of assets with book value of \u00a3795 million (\u20ac914 million) consisting of a selfsubscribed  securitization program  and  a  bond.  The financing received from the Bank of England against these guarantees amounts to \u20ac471 million at December 31, 2023. All assets  provided  as  guarantees  to  the  Banque  de  France and the Bank of England remain in the balance sheet.",

In view of the development prospects for Whylot, which will require revenue diversification beyond  the automotive segment, when its financing strategy was defined the parties agreed to suspend this call option temporarily.\n\nThe  Group  holds  derivative  instruments  to  subscribe  to future capital increases by Verkor, without taking control of the  company.  No  liability  is  recognized  in  connection  with this commitment.\n\nThe  agreement  for  the  sale  by  Renault  Group  of  its investments  in  Renault  Russia  and  the  AVTOVAZ  Group, which  took  place  on  May  15,  2022,  gives  Renault  Group  an option to buy back its investment in Lada Auto Holding (the\n\n## Note 29 - Subsequent events\n\nThe  acquisition  of  Mobility  Concept  and  MeinAuto,  two divisions of leading German vehicle leaser MeinAuto Group, by  Mobilize  Lease&Co,  a  subsidiary  of  Mobilize  Financial\n\nServices, was completed on January 2, 2024.

A  \u20ac400  million  contribution  will  automatically give the Group a 51% investment.\n\nThe derivative corresponding to this option has nil value at December 31, 2023 (as at December 31, 2022).\n\n05",

December 31, 2023 and of the results of its operations for the year then ended in accordance with French accounting principles.\n\nThe audit opinion expressed above is consistent with our report to the Audit and Risks Committee.\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\n## Audit Framework\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with professional standards applicable in France. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\nOur responsibilities under those standards are further described in the 'Statutory Auditors' Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements'section of our report.\n\n## Independence\n\nWe conducted our audit engagement in compliance with independence requirements of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce) and the French Code of Ethics (code de d\u00e9ontologie) for statutory auditors for the period from January 1 st , 2023 to the  date  of  our  report  and  specifically  we  did  not  provide  any  prohibited  non-audit  services  referred  to  in  Article  5(1)  of Regulation (EU) N o 537/2014.\n\n## Justification of Assessments - Key Audit Matters\n\nIn accordance with the requirements of Articles L.821-53 and R.821-180 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce) relating  to  the  justification  of  our  assessments,  we  inform  you  of  the  key  audit  matters  relating  to  risks  of  material misstatement  that,  in  our  professional  judgment,  were  of  most  significance  in  our  audit  of  the  financial  statements  of  the current period, as well as how we addressed those risks.\n\nThese matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on specific items of the financial statements.\n\n## Valuation of equity investments\n\n## Risk identified\n\nAt  December  31,  2023  equity  investments  are  composed  by  'investments  stated  at  equity'  and  'other  investments',  and are accounted for in Renault balance sheet for 14,863 million euros, representing one of the most significant caption of the total assets.\n\nWith respect to Renault's investments in fully controlled companies, Renault has opted for the equity method. Their value in the balance sheet is determined on the basis of the share of each of these companies, fully consolidated, in the shareholders' equity determined according to the rules of consolidation, without taking into account the elimination of transactions between group companies. The annual change  in the overall share of shareholders' equity corresponding to these interests is recorded in  shareholders'  equity  under  'Equity  valuation  difference'.  When  the  'equity  valuation  difference'  becomes  negative,  a provision for overall depreciation is accounted in the income statement.\n\nOther investments, i.e. investments in non-exclusively controlled companies, are recorded in the balance sheet at acquisition cost, excluding incidental purchase expenses, and mainly concern Renault's investment in Nissan. As indicated in note 1 to the financial  statements,  Renault  transferred,  during  the  period,  28.4%  of  Nissan  Motor  Co.  shares  to  the  French  trust  'Fiducie Newton' for an amount of 3.7 billion euros. Those investments are valued at the lower of acquisition cost or book value, taking\n\nI\n\nFinancial statements\n\n05",

When the book value of the securities is lower than the gross value, a depreciation is recorded for the amount of the difference.\n\nThe assessment of the recoverable value of Renault's investment in Nissan requires judgement from management.\n\nIn this context, we have considered that the valuation of the investments was a key audit matter due to their importance in the company's financial  statements  and  management's  estimates  and  judgments  necessary  to  determine  the  value  in  use  of equity interests, particularly with regards to Renault's stake in Nissan.\n\n## Our audit response\n\nWe have reviewed the methodology used by management to determine the equity value of equity securities of companies controlled exclusively and the value in use of other equity securities.\n\nIn order to assess the reasonableness of the value in use of equity investments, we mainly relied on the work performed for the purpose of the consolidated financial statement audit. Our work mainly consisted in:\n\n## Regarding Renault's investments in controlled companies:\n\n- \u25cf Check that the shareholders' equity in each of these investments corresponds to the shareholders' equity used to prepare Renault's consolidated financial statements,\n- \u25cf Check  that  Renault  has  performed  the  necessary  adjustments,  if  any,  to  take  into  account  potential  impairment  losses accounted for in the group's consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Regarding Renault's investment in Nissan:\n\n- \u25cf Assessing whether there are any identified impairment indicators: significant unfavorable changes in the markets where Nissan operates or a significant or prolonged decline in the share's market value, being key indicators.\n- \u25cf Assessing the appropriateness of the information provided in the notes to the individual financial statements.\n\n## Specific Verifications\n\nWe have also performed, in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, the specific verifications required by laws and regulations.\n\n## Information given in the management report and in the other documents with respect to the financial position and the financial statements provided to the Shareholders\n\nWe have no matters to report as to the fair presentation and the consistency with the financial statements of the information given in the management report of the Board of Directors and in the other documents with respect to the financial position and the financial statements provided to the Shareholders.\n\nWe  attest  the  fair  presentation  and  the  consistency  with  the  financial  statements  of  the  information  relating  to  payment deadlines mentioned in Article D. 441-6 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce).\n\n## Report on corporate governance\n\nWe attest that the Board of Directors report on corporate governance sets out the information required by Articles L. 225-37-4, L. 22-10-10 and L. 22-10-9 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce).\n\nConcerning the information given in accordance with the requirements of Article L. 22-10-9 of the French Commercial Code (Code  de  commerce)  relating  to  remunerations  and  benefits  received  by  or  awarded  to  the  directors  and  any  other commitments made in their favour,  we  have  verified  the  consistency  with  the  financial  statements,  or  with  the  underlying information used to prepare these financial statements and, where applicable, with the information obtained by your company from controlled companies included in the scope of consolidation. Based on these procedures, we attest the accuracy and fair presentation of this information.\n\nWith respect to the information relating to items that your company considered likely to have an impact in the event of a public takeover bid or exchange offer, provided pursuant to Article L. 22-10-11 of the French Commercial Code, we have agreed this information to the source documents communicated to us. Based on these procedures, we have no observations to make on this information.",

Our objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not  a  guarantee  that  an  audit  conducted  in  accordance  with  professional  standards  will  always  detect  a  material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate,  they  could  reasonably  be  expected  to  influence  the  economic  decisions  of  users  taken  on  the  basis  of  these financial statements.\n\nAs  specified  in  Article  L.  821-55  of  the  French  Commercial  Code  (Code  de  commerce),  our  statutory  audit  does  not  include assurance on the viability of the Company or the quality of management of the affairs of the Company.\n\nAs part of an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, the statutory auditor exercises professional judgment throughout the audit and furthermore:\n\n- \u25cf Identifies and assesses the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, designs and  performs  audit  procedures  responsive  to  those  risks,  and  obtains  audit  evidence  considered  to  be  sufficient  and appropriate to provide a basis for his opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n\nI\n\n05",

This assessment is based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date  of  his  audit  report.  However,  future  events  or  conditions  may  cause  the  Company  to  cease  to  continue  as  a  going concern. If the statutory auditor concludes that a material uncertainty exists, there is a requirement to draw attention in the audit report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are not provided or inadequate, to modify the opinion expressed therein.\n- \u25cf Evaluates  the  overall  presentation  of  the  financial  statements  and  assesses  whether  these  statements  represent  the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n\n## Report to the Audit Committee\n\nWe submit to the Audit and Risks Committee a report which includes in particular a description of the scope of the audit and the audit program implemented, as well as the results of our audit. We also report, if any, significant deficiencies in internal control regarding the accounting and financial reporting procedures that we have identified.\n\nOur report to the Audit and Risks Committee includes the risks of material misstatement that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and which are therefore the key audit matters that we are required to describe in this report.\n\nWe also provide the Audit and Risks Committee with the declaration provided for in Article 6 of Regulation (EU) N\u00b0 537/2014, confirming  our  independence  within  the  meaning  of  the  rules  applicable  in  France  such  as  they  are  set  in  particular  by Articles L. 821-27 to L. 821-34 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce) and in the French Code of Ethics ( Code de d\u00e9ontologie )  for  statutory  auditors.  Where  appropriate,  we  discuss  with  the  Audit  and  Risks  Committee  the  risks  that  may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and the related safeguards.\n\nParis La D\u00e9fense, February 23, 2024\n\nThe statutory auditors French original signed by\n\nKPMG S.A.\n\nBertrand Pruvost\n\nMAZARS\n\nLo\u00efc Wallaert",

        "page_content": "## 5.2.5 Notes to the financial statements\n\nThe following disclosures constitute the notes to the financial statements, before appropriation of net profit for the year, at December 31, 2023. The balance sheet total is \u20ac35 104 million and the  income  statement  for  the  year  shows  a  net  profit  of \u20ac926 million.\n\nThe  financial  year  is  of  twelve  months'  duration,  covering the period from January 1 to December 31, 2023.\n\n## 5.2.5.1 Significant events of the year\n\nOn November 8, 2023, the New Alliance Agreement between Renault Group and Nissan took effect.\n\nUnder the terms of this new agreement, Renault transferred 28.4% of the shares of Nissan Motor Co., Ltd (out of its 43.4% stake), at the value of \u20ac3.7 billion, to Natixis Fiduciaire under the  'Newton' trust agreement. The votes will be exercised neutrally, subject to certain exceptions. In consideration of this  transfer,  Renault  S.A.  received  a  financial  asset  of  an equivalent value representing its rights in the Trust. Renault S.A.  continues  to  fully  benefit  from  the  economic  rights  (to dividends  and  proceeds  of  share  sales)  attached  to  the shares held by the trust until they are sold. Renault S.A. may sell  the  entrusted Nissan shares, but it has no obligation to do so within a specific pre-determined period. Any such sale must  follow  a  process  organized  and  coordinated  with Nissan  that  gives  Nissan  or  a  designated  third  party  the right of first refusal.\n\nOn December 13, 2023, the trust was instructed to sell Nissan 211  million  of  Nissan  Motor  Co.,  Ltd  shares  at  the  price  of \u20ac3.62 per share, giving a total of \u20ac764 million for a nominal value  of  \u20ac656  million.  This  operation  generated  a  gain  of \u20ac108 million. As Nissan has cancelled these shares, Renault S.A.'s  percentage  interest  in  Nissan  Motor  Co.,  Ltd  is  now 40.65%.\n\n## 5.2.5.2 Accounting policies\n\nRenault  S.A.  has  drawn  up  its  annual  financial  statements for  the  year  ended  December  31,  2023  in  accordance  with the  French  chart  of  accounts  defined  by  the  ANC  ( Autorit\u00e9 des Normes Comptables ) and French laws and regulations.\n\nThe  financial  year  is  of  twelve  months'  duration,  covering the period from January 1 to December 31, 2023.\n\nThe  following  notes  are  an  integral  part  of  the  annual financial statements.\n\nThese financial statements were approved for issue by the Board of Directors on February 14, 2024.\n\n## 5.2.5.2.1 Financial assets\n\nInvestments  stated  at  equity  are  holdings  in  whollycontrolled  companies.  As  an  alternative  to  the  standard\n\nThe financial statements for 2023 were approved for issue by the Board of Directors of Renault S.A. on February 14, 2024.\n\nRenault  S.A.'s  financial  statements  are  included  in  the consolidated  financial  statements  of  Renault  S.A.  (Renault Group).\n\nNissan's  financial  year,  which  ended  on  March  31,  2023, recorded a profit of \u20ac1,570 million (\u00a5222 billion) and Renault S.A.  received  \u20ac172  million  (\u00a527  billion)  of  dividends  from Nissan during 2023.\n\nDuring 2023 Renault S.A. redeemed two bonds issued on the Japanese  market  as  part  of  Renault's  Shelf  Registration program, for a total \u00a558 billion (\u20ac446 million). At the date of publication of these annual financial statements, the Group has  sufficient  cash  and  sources  of  financing  to  ensure continuity of operations for the next twelve months, and has demonstrated its capacity to issue debt.\n\nIn  the  current  period  of  in-depth  change,  to  engage  all employees in the Group's strategy and future performance, Renault  Group  is  continuing  the  Renaulution  Share  Plan.  It launched a further employee share ownership operation in 2023, attributing 8 free shares to each of the Group's eligible employees  in 30 countries. Over 95,000 employees benefited  from  this  plan.  In  23  countries,  the  plan  also offered  the  chance  to  purchase  shares  on  preferential terms  (including  a  30%  discount  and  allocation  of  up  to 8  additional  free  shares).  The  reference  share  price  under this  Renaulution  Share  Plan  is  set  at  \u20ac37.54,  giving  a discounted subscription price of \u20ac26.28.\n\nvaluation  method  for  investments  carried  in  the  balance sheet, Renault S.A. has opted to state investments in whollycontrolled  companies  at  equity.  In  accordance  with  CNC ( Conseil National de la Comptabilit\u00e9 ) avis 34 (July 1988),\n\n- \u25cf this  method  is  applied  to  all  companies  that  are  fully consolidated  in  Renault  Group  consolidated  financial statements;\n- \u25cf the shareholders' equity of these companies is determined under the accounting policies applied in the Renault Group consolidated financial statements; as this is a valuation method, intercompany eliminations are not taken into account;\n- \u25cf in  valuing  a  subsidiary,  its  holdings  in  companies  wholly controlled by the Group are valued in the same way;\n\nI\n\nFinancial statements\n\n05",

This  amount cannot be distributed or used to offset losses. When it is negative, a provision for general depreciation is established as a charge against income.\n\nOther Investments are investments in companies not wholly controlled  by  Renault  S.A.  They  are  carried  in  the  balance sheet at  acquisition  cost,  less  related  expenses,  or  at  their book value if this is lower. The book value takes account of the share  of  net  assets  and  profitability  prospects. Provisions  are  established  when  the  book  value  of  the investments is lower than the gross value.\n\nAdvances  to  subsidiaries  and  affiliates  are  recorded  at historical cost. Impairment is recognized when there is a risk that these advances will not be recovered.\n\n## 5.2.5.2.2 Receivables\n\nReceivables  are  stated  at  nominal  value.  Impairment  is recognized when their realisable value falls below historical cost, notably based on age and the risk of non-recovery.\n\n## 5.2.5.2.3 Marketable securities\n\nMarketable  securities  are  valued  at  acquisition  cost, excluding related expenses and accrued interest for bonds, or at market value if this is lower.\n\nTreasury  shares  held  for  the  purposes  of  free  share  plans, stock option plans and the liquidity contract are included in marketable  securities.  These  shares  are  covered  by  a provision  for  expenses,  corresponding  to  the  difference between  the  value  of  the  shares  (acquisition  price  or  net book  value  at  the  date  of  reallocation)  and  the  exercise price  of  the  options  for  beneficiaries,  when  that  exercise price is lower than the acquisition cost.\n\nTreasury  shares  not  allocated  to  a  specific  plan  are  also included in marketable securities. A provision is recorded if the stock market price falls below the book value.\n\nThe  fair  value  of  securities  is  determined  mainly  by reference to market prices.\n\n## 5.2.5.2.4 Translation of foreign currency receivables and liabilities\n\nReceivables and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated as follows:\n\n- \u25cf all  receivables  and  liabilities  in  foreign  currencies  are converted at the year-end exchange rate;\n- \u25cf exchange  differences  arising  between  the  date  of transactions  and  December  31,  are  recorded  in  Other assets or Deferred income (translation adjustment);\n- \u25cf a provision for risk equal to the unrealized exchange losses is established after determining an overall foreign exchange position for each currency (including derivatives).\n\nIn  application  of  ANC  regulation  2015-05,  no  provisions  are recorded in the income statement for unrealized losses on\n\nhedging  instruments  until  the  hedged  cash  flows  are realized (date of liquidation or sale of the investment).\n\n## 5.2.5.2.5 Redeemable shares\n\nRedeemable  shares  are  recorded  in  a  separate  line  of shareholders'  equity  at  nominal  value  with  no  subsequent revaluation.\n\n## 5.2.5.2.6 Financial loans and borrowings\n\nLoans  are  stated  at  their  nominal  amount.  Loan  costs, including  issuance  expenses  and  premiums,  and  bond redemption premiums, which are recorded in Other Assets, are amortized on a straight-line basis over the corresponding duration.\n\n## 5.2.5.2.7 Provisions for risks and liabilities\n\nProvisions for risks and liabilities are defined in accordance with  ANC  regulation  2014-03.  They  are  established  for probable  payment  obligations  existing  at  the  year-end. A  contingent  liability,  in  contrast,  is  an  obligation  that  is neither  probable  nor  definite  at  the  date  the  financial statements  are  established,  or  a  probable  obligation  that cannot be reliably estimated. Provisions are not established for contingent liabilities, but an off-balance sheet commitment is reported where relevant.\n\n## 5.2.5.2.8 Derivatives and hedge accounting\n\nChanges  in  the  value  of  hedging  instruments  are  not recognized  in  the  balance  sheet  unless  partial  or  total recognition of such changes  is relevant to ensure symmetrical treatment with the hedged item.\n\nThis symmetrical treatment would involve revaluation of the hedging  instrument  in  a  transition account, with a corresponding  entry  in  a  Cash  Instruments  account,  in parallel to the unrealized foreign exchange gains and losses booked on the hedged item.\n\nThe  value  of  derivatives  in  an  'Isolated  Open  Position'  is adjusted  to  market  value  in  the  balance  sheet  at  each  yearend, via an entry to the unrealized foreign exchange gains or losses account. If the market value indicates an unrealized loss, an equivalent provision is recognized in the income statement.\n\nUnrealized foreign exchange gains and losses are determined by comparing the exchange rate at the start of the operation with the year-end exchange rate.\n\nUnrealized foreign exchange gains and losses on the Samurai bond  issued  for  the  Nissan  hedge  are  recognized  in  specific accounts in Other receivables or Other liabilities. The amounts accrued in the balance sheet are transferred to profit and loss at the date of liquidation or sale of the investment.\n\n## 5.2.5.2.9 Exceptional items\n\nExceptional items are revenues and expenses resulting from events  or  transactions  that  are  clearly  distinct  from  the company's  normal  business  operations,  and  are  not expected to recur on a frequent or regular basis.",

In  consideration  of this contribution, Renault s.a.s issued 225,917 new shares for the total value of \u20ac175 million as part of a capital increase to the benefit of Renault S.A.\n\nThe implementation of the Renaulution Share Plan generated a net expense of \u20ac43 million.\n\nIn 2023 Renault S.A. recorded net proceeds of \u20ac6 million from its free share plans.\n\n## 5.2.5.3.5 Income tax\n\nRenault S.A. has headed the French tax consolidation group since January 1, 2004, and French subsidiaries that are more than  95%  owned  by  Renault  S.A.  pay  their  income  taxes directly  to  the  company.  Each  of  these  entities  records  its theoretical  taxes  as  if  it  was  taxed  separately.  The  tax savings generated by this are treated as income for Renault S.A  as  head  of  the  group.  The  Renault  tax  consolidation\n\ngroup applies the principle of neutrality, and Renault S.A. is not  obliged  to  reallocate  or  reimburse  the  subsidiaries  for the tax savings resulting from utilization of their tax losses.\n\nThe maximum allowable amount of losses carried forward against taxable income is \u20ac1 million plus 50% of the taxable income  above  that  amount.  The  balance  can  be  carried forward indefinitely.\n\nThese rules are applicable:\n\n- \u25cf for  determining the income/loss of the tax consolidation group;\n- \u25cf by  convention,  for  determining  the  income/loss  of  each company included in the tax consolidation group serving as a base for calculation of their income tax.\n\nThese rules on tax loss utilization and carryforwards apply to all losses existing at the year-end, whatever their origin.\n\nRenault S.A. utilized \u20ac657 million of losses in the determination of the 2023 taxable income, since the French tax group reported a profit of \u20ac1,312 million.\n\nThe tax income generated by the tax consolidation group in 2023 was \u20ac218 million, corresponding to the income tax paid by  the  subsidiaries  of  Renault  S.A.,  including  any  tax adjustments, calculated as if they were taxed separately.\n\nDetails of the tax income recognized for the year are as follows:\n\n|                                        |                   | Taxes       | Taxes   | Taxes            | Taxes      | Net income     | Net income    | Net income   |\n|----------------------------------------|-------------------|-------------|---------|------------------|------------|----------------|---------------|--------------|\n| (\u20ac million)                            | Income before tax | Theoretical | Netting | Credit generated | Tax credit | Net tax charge | Theo- retical | As booked    |\n| Current income subject to  normal rate | 759               | (62)        | 62      |                  |            | (62)           | 821           | 697          |\n| Exceptional income                     | 12                | (1)         |         |                  |            | (1)            | 12            | 11           |\n| Tax consolidation                      |                   | 218         |         |                  |            | 218            |               | 218          |\n| Provisions                             |                   | -           |         |                  |            | -              |               | -            |\n| Others                                 |                   |             |         |                  |            |                |               |              |\n| TOTAL                                  | 771               | 155         | 62      | -                | -          | 155            | 833           | 926          |\n\nDetails of Renault S.A.'s deferred tax position are as follows:\n\n|                                                                                 | 2023        | 2023             | 2022        | 2022             | Variations   | Variations       |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|------------------|-------------|------------------|--------------|------------------|\n| (\u20ac million)                                                                     | Assets  (1) | Liabilities  (2) | Assets  (1) | Liabilities  (2) | Assets  (1)  | Liabilities  (2) |\n| Expenses deducted (or taxed income) not yet  recognized for accounting purposes | 88          | 107              | 33          | 81               | 55           | 26               |\n| TOTAL                                                                           | 88          | 107              | 33          | 81               | 55           | 26               |\n\nAs part of tax consolidation group, Renault S.A.'s loss carryforwards as of December 31, 2023 amount to 17,941 million euros.",

At December 31, 2020, \u20ac4 billion had been drawn on this credit line.\n\nThe initial maturity for each drawdown was 12 months, and Renault had the option to extend the maturity by a further three  years,  with  repayment  of  one  third  each  year.  The Group  exercised  the  extension  options  on  all  these drawdowns  except  for  the  drawdown  maturing  in  August 2021, of which \u20ac1 billion was repaid.\n\nThis State-guaranteed credit facility was fully repaid in the first half-year of 2023.\n\n## 5.2.5.5.4.3 Other loans and financial debts\n\nOther loans and financial debts amounted to \u20ac4,509 million at December 31, 2023 (\u20ac3,848 million in 2022), and principally comprise:\n\n- \u25cf \u20ac3,713 million in borrowings from Group subsidiaries with surplus cash;\n- \u25cf \u20ac796 million in treasury notes.\n\nAll these loans and financial debts mature within 1 year.\n\nNo loans are secured.\n\nI",

These  gains  also  include  foreign  exchange  effects  on  certain  hedging  instruments  that  have  exceeded  their maturity  date:  these  foreign  exchange  effects  are  retained  in  the  balance  sheet  and  transferred  to  the  income  statement under symmetrical treatment to the hedged item.\n\n## 5.2.5.6 Financial instruments\n\n## 5.2.5.6.1 Financial instruments and risk management\n\nThe corresponding commitments (expressed in terms of notional amount, and fair value where relevant) are shown below:\n\n|                   | 2023     | 2023       | 2022     | 2022       |\n|-------------------|----------|------------|----------|------------|\n| (\u20ac million)       | Notional | Fair value | Notional | Fair value |\n| Currency swaps    | 1,072    | (142)      | 1,376    | (27)       |\n| Rates swaps       | 50       | (2)        |          |            |\n| Forward purchases | 471      | (1)        | 736      | 11         |\n\nAll these operations are with Renault Finance.\n\nForward purchases and sales and swap transactions are off-balance sheet.\n\n## Foreign exchange risk\n\nForeign exchange  risk  management  essentially  uses currency swaps and forward exchange operations to hedge Renault's own foreign-currency financing. Renault S.A. also undertakes  forward  exchange  operations  to  hedge  loans and borrowings of its subsidiaries in foreign currencies.\n\n## Interest rate risk\n\nRenault  S.A.  carries  most  of  the  Group's  indebtedness.  Its interest  rate  risk  management  policy  applies  two  basic principles:  long-term  investments  use  fixed-rate  financing, and  investments  for  liquidity  reserves  use  floating-rate financing.  The  financing  in  yen  undertaken  as  part  of  the hedge of the financial investment in Nissan is fixed-rate.\n\nRenault  S.A.  uses  derivatives  to  implement  the  above interest  rate  and  exchange  risk  management  policies. These  operations  are  undertaken  with  Renault  Finance,  a fully-owned Renault Group subsidiary.",

It  therefore regularly  borrows  on  the  banking  and  capital  markets  to refinance its debt, and this exposes it to a liquidity risk in the event of market closure or tensions over credit availability. As part of its centralized cash management policy, Renault S.A. handles most refinancing for the automotive operating segment  via  the  capital  markets  through  long-term resources (bond issues, private placements) and short-term financing (treasury notes), or by bank financing.\n\n## 5.2.5.6.2 Commitments given and received\n\nThe commitments received by Renault S.A. include unused open  credit  lines  amounting  to  \u20ac3,310  million  in  2023, compared to \u20ac3,430 million in 2022. These credit lines do not contain any covenants.\n\n## Contingent liabilities\n\nCompanies included in the French tax consolidation group headed  by  Renault  S.A.  are  periodically  subject  to  tax\n\n## 5.2.5.7 Other information\n\n## 5.2.5.7.1 Cash flow\n\nCash flow is determined as follows:\n\n| (\u20ac million)                                          | 2023   | 2022   |\n|------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Net income                                           | 926    | 364    |\n| Increases to provisions and deferred charges         | 15     | 26     |\n| Net increase to provisions for risks and liabilities | (24)   | (14)   |\n| Net increase to impairment                           |        | (9)    |\n| Net value of assets sold                             | (163)  |        |\n| TOTAL                                                | 754    | 366    |\n\n## 5.2.5.7.2 Workforce\n\nRenault S.A. has no employees.\n\n## 5.2.5.7.3 Directors' fees and remuneration of key management executives\n\nThe  net  amount  of  Directors'  fees  to  be  paid  to  directors amounts  to  \u20ac861,260  in  respect  of  2023  (\u20ac915,090  paid  for 2022).  The  Chairman  of  the  Board  of  Directors  does  not receive directors' fees.\n\nRemuneration excluding social security charges recognized in  the  income  statement  in  2023,  including  the  provisional variable portion, amounts to \u20ac4 million.\n\n113,919 performance shares were awarded to key management executives in 2023.\n\nI\n\nRenault  S.A.  also  has  confirmed  credit  agreements  with banking establishments (see note 6.2).\n\nThe contractual documentation for these financing arrangements and credit agreements contains no clause that might  adversely  affect  credit  availability  as  a  result  of  a change in Renault's credit rating or financial ratio compliance.\n\nGiven the available cash reserves, the confirmed credit lines unused  at  the  year-end,  and  the  prospects  for  renewal  of short-term  financing,  Renault  S.A.  has  sufficient  financial resources to cover its commitments over a 12-month horizon.\n\ninspections.  Accepted  tax  adjustments  are  recorded  as provisions  in  the  financial  statements.  Contested  tax adjustments are recognized on a case-by-case basis, taking into  account  the  risk  that  the  proceedings  or  appeals undertaken  may  be  unsuccessful.  Tax  liabilities are recognized via provisions when there are uncertainties over the determination of taxes.",

This agreement was signed on July 26, 2023.\n\nThe terms of this agreement define:\n\n- i. the amount Nissan would invest in Ampere,\n- ii. the terms and conditions under which Nissan would invest in the event of a public offering of Ampere shares,\n- iii. the terms and conditions for Nissan's private investment in Ampere if no public offering of Ampere shares is made prior to December 31, 2024,\n- iv. the draft shareholders' agreements to be entered into between Renault S.A. and Nissan in the event of a public offering of Ampere shares or, as the case may be, in the event of a private investment by Nissan,\n- v. the standard representations and warranties for similar transactions. Completion of the investment is subject to customary conditions precedent, including applicable regulatory approvals.\n\nThe terms of this agreement do not contain any price implications for the company. The maximum amount to be invested by Nissan, via a subscription to Ampere shares, is 600 million euros.\n\nYour  Board  of  Directors  has  explained  why  it  is  in  your  company's  interest  to  enter  into  this  agreement,  stating  that  it  will maximize  value  creation  within  Ampere,  a  subsidiary  owned  by  Renault  S.A.,  and  contribute  to  strengthening  the  RenaultNissan-Mitsubishi Alliance.\n\n## \u25cf With the French State\n\n## Persons concerned\n\nMr.  Thomas Courbe, director of your company appointed by the French State, and Mr. Alexis Zajdenweber, director of your company appointed by the French State.\n\n## Deed of termination of the Governance Agreement\n\nAt  its  meeting  on  November  5,  2023,  your  Board  of  Directors  authorized  the  conclusion  of  an  agreement  entitled  \"Deed  of Termination of the Governance Agreement\" between your Company and the French State, the purpose of which is to formalize the termination of the governance agreement entered into between your Company and the French State on February 4, 2016, which  restricted  the  free  exercise  of  the  French  State's  voting  rights  in  respect  of  certain  decisions  submitted  to  your Company's Shareholders' Meeting. This agreement was signed on November 8, 2023.\n\nThe conclusion of this agreement results from the termination of the Restated Alliance Master Agreement concluded between your company and Nissan on March 28, 2002, which provided for the possibility for Nissan to exercise the voting rights attached to its shareholding in your company up to a limit of 15% of the exercisable voting rights.

This amendment has been concluded on December 19, 2013 and has been approved by the Annual General Meeting of April 30, 2014.\n\nIn October 2016, Nissan Motor Co. Ltd. acquired 34% of the capital of Mitsubishi Motors Corporation. At its meeting of June 15, 2018, your Board of Directors authorized the conclusion of a second amendment to the \"Master Cooperation Agreement\", the subject of which is the accession of Mitsubishi Motors Corporation in the cooperation. The signing of this second amendment on October 3, 2018 was approved by your General Meeting of June 12, 2019.\n\nThe Master Cooperation Agreement and its endorsements continue to produce effect between the parties.\n\n## \u25cf With the French State, shareholder of your Company\n\n## Persons concerned\n\nMr Thomas Courbe and Mr Alexis Zajdenweber, Board members of your Company representing the French State.\n\n## Governance Agreement\n\nOn December 11, 2015, your Board of Directors authorized the conclusion of a 'Governance Agreement' between Renault and the French State which aims to regulate the exercise of voting rights attached to the Renault S.A. shares held by the French State.\n\nPursuant to the authorization granted by your Board of Directors, on February 4, 2016 and by your Annual General Meeting on April 29, 2016, your Company has signed concurrently with the French State a Governance Agreement under which the voting rights attached to  the  French  State's  shares  exceeding  a  certain  percentage  of  Renault's  total  exercisable  rights  (set  at  17.9%  in  the  event  of  a \"usual\" quorum, or at 20% in the event of a particularly high quorum) are, in certain cases, exercised in a neutral manner, that is to say in such a way that they do not affect the adoption or rejection of the resolutions concerned by the limitation. The written agreement also describes the conditions for implementing these restrictions with the registrar of Renault S.A.\n\nThe restriction to the free exercise of voting rights of the French State notably applies to all decisions which fall within the authority of the Ordinary Annual General Meeting, except for decisions concerning dividend distributions, the appointment, renewal or removal from office of Board members representing the French State, the disposal of significant Company's assets, related-party  agreements  that  are  not  approved  by  the  representatives  of  the  French  State  and  buybacks  of  shares  from identified shareholders. However, the French State retains all of its voting rights for decisions which fall within the authority of the Extraordinary Annual General Meeting, except for the most day-to-day decision-making such as the granting or renewal of ongoing  delegations  to  the  management  bodies  of  your  Company  when  their  conditions  comply  with  the  latter's  existing practices, the granting of stock options, performance shares or shares that give access to the share capital to the benefit of employees and executive corporate officer of the Renault Group, an amendment to the age limit for the exercise of duties or to the term of office of Board members and executive corporate officer and a transfer of registered office (unless abroad).\n\nThe restrictions to the free exercise of voting rights would cease to apply in exceptional situations such as the amendment or termination of the 'Restated Alliance Master Agreement' (see below), the exercise by Nissan Motor Co. Ltd of voting rights in your Company, the announcement of a public offering on your Company's shares, or a shareholder exceeding the threshold of 15% in your Company's capital or voting rights, including Nissan Motor Co. Ltd.\n\nThe governance agreement has been terminated on Novembre 8, 2023 with the signing of the 'Deed of termination of the Governance Agreement'.\n\n05",

This  agreement specifies the operational terms and conditions of Renault-Nissan B.V. ('RNBV') as the corporate entity involved in defining the Alliance's strategy.\n\nAn  initial  amendment  to  the  'Restated  Alliance  Master  Agreement'  was  signed  on  April  29,  2005  and  submitted  for  the approval of the Annual General Meeting of May 4, 2006.\n\nIn its meeting of October 3, 2012, your Board of Directors authorized the signature, on November 7, 2012, of a second amendment to the 'Restated Alliance Master Agreement', which modifies the composition of the RNBV Executive Board and as a result, the voting arrangements within the Executive Board. This amendment was submitted to the approval of your general meeting of April 30, 2013.\n\nIn its meeting on December 11, 2015, your Board of Directors authorized the signature of a governance agreement between your Company and Nissan Motor Co. Ltd. concerning the governance of Nissan Motor Co., which constitutes a third amendment to the 'Restated Alliance Master Agreement'.\n\nThe conditions of this third amendment concern your Company's undertaking (i) to vote in favour of the resolutions proposed by the Board of Directors of Nissan to the Annual General Meeting of Nissan for the appointment, dismissal and compensation of the members of the Board of Directors of Nissan (other than the members appointed upon proposal of your Company, (ii) not to submit a resolution to the Annual General Meeting of Nissan that would not have been approved by the Board of Directors of Nissan , and (iii) not to vote in favour of a resolution that would not be supported by the Board of Directors of Nissan.\n\nFor  these  resolutions,  your  Company  remains  free  to  vote  as  it  sees  fit,  however,  in  the  event  that  your  Company  does  not comply  with  its  commitment,  Nissan  may  acquire  Renault's  shares  without  the  prior  approval  of  your  Board  of  Directors, notwithstanding the provisions of the Restated Alliance Agreement which prevent the parties from increasing, without prior agreement, their respective holdings. The amendment modifies the 'Restated Alliance Master Agreement' without altering its term, which remains indefinite. It has been applicable since it was entered into. This agreement has been approved by the Annual General Meeting of April 29, 2016.\n\nThe 'Restated Alliance Master Agreement' was terminated on July 26, 2023 with the signing of the 'New Alliance Agreement'.\n\nParis La D\u00e9fense, February 23, 2024\n\nThe Statutory Auditors French original signed by\n\nKPMG S.A\n\nBertrand Pruvost\n\nMAZARS\n\nLo\u00efc Wallaert",

The  right  to attend  Annual  General  Meetings  is  evidenced  by  the registration of the shares in an account in the name of the shareholder  or  in  the  name  of  the  registered  intermediary acting  on  his  or  her  behalf,  by  midnight  (zero  hours)  Paris time on the second working day before the Annual General Meeting, either in the registered share account held by the Company  or  in  the  bearer  share  accounts  held  by  an authorised intermediary. The registration of bearer shares in the  share  records  held  by  the  authorised  intermediary  is evidenced by a shareholding certificate issued by the said intermediary.\n\n## 6.1.2.3 Shares and voting rights\n\nShares  are  registered  in  an  account  according  to  the provisions  and  terms  established  by  law.  Fully  paid-up shares  are  in  either  registered  or  bearer  form,  at  the discretion of their owner. However, shares that are not fully paid-up must be in registered form.\n\nEach  shareholder  has  as  many  votes  as  shares  owned, subject to the following provisions.\n\nSince 3 April 2016, pursuant to Article L. 225-123 of the French Commercial  Code,  as  amended  by  Law  No.  2014-384  of 29 March 2014 (the Florange Law), unless provided otherwise in the Renault articles of association adopted subsequently to  the  promulgation  of  the  Florange  Law,  a  voting  right double  to  that  conferred  to  other  shares  is  automatically attributed  to  all  fully  paid-up  shares  for  which  proof  of registration is provided for at least two years in the name of the same shareholder.\n\nAt 31 December 2023, 105,107,151 Renault shares had double voting  rights,  representing  around  35.54%  of  the  share capital and around 53.15% of the voting rights that may be exercised in Renault's Annual General Meeting at that date.\n\nThe double voting right automatically ceases for any share that has been converted to a bearer share or undergone a transfer  of  ownership,  subject  to  any  exceptions  provided for by law.\n\nFree shares resulting from the capital increase, earnings or other paid-in capital are entitled to double voting rights from their  date  of  issue  if  they  are  attributed  on  account  of shares already enjoying such rights.\n\nIn  addition,  treasury  shares  do  not  carry  voting  rights. At 31 December 2023, the theoretical number of voting rights was 400,829,435.\n\nAs  a  result  of  the  5,324,520  treasury  shares,  the  number  of exercisable voting rights was 395,504,915 at 31 December 2023.\n\nThe Company is authorised to make use of the appropriate legal provisions for identifying shareholders having immediate  or  future  voting  rights  in  its  own  Shareholders' Meetings.\n\n## 6.1.2.5 Shareholding disclosures\n\nIn  addition  to  the  legal  requirement  for  shareholders  to inform the Company if they hold certain percentages of its share  capital  or  voting  rights,  every  shareholder  or  fund management  company  that  comes  into  possession  of  a number of shares above 2% of the share capital or  voting rights,  or  a  multiple  of  this  percentage  representing  less than or equal to 5% of the share capital or voting rights, shall inform  the  Company  of  the  total  number  of  shares  held. Such  disclosure  shall  be  made  by  registered  letter  with return receipt within four (4) working days from the date of registration  of  the  shares  that  brought  the  shareholder's interest up to or beyond the threshold. In excess of 5%, the aforementioned  disclosure  requirement  applies  to  1% fractions of the share capital or voting rights.\n\nFor  the  purposes  of  determining  the  thresholds  described above,  indirectly  held  shares  or  equity  equivalents  held  as defined by the provisions of Articles L. 233-7 and L. 233-9 of the French Commercial Code will also be taken into account.\n\nThe declarer must certify that the said declaration includes all  shares  held  or  owned  as  per  the  provisions  of  the preceding  paragraph  and  must  indicate  the  acquisition date(s).  The  disclosure  requirement  applies  in  the  same manner  if  the  holding  of  shares  falls  below  any  of  the aforementioned thresholds, 2% or 1% as applicable.\n\nIf the conditions described above are not complied with, any shares  exceeding  the  fraction  that  should  have  been declared  shall  be  deprived  of  its  voting  rights  at  any Shareholders'  Meetings  held  in  a  period  of  two  years following  the  date  of  due  notification,  in  so  far  as  this  is requested at the meeting by one or more shareholders who together hold at least 1% of share capital.\n\n## Threshold crossings in 2023\n\nDuring  the  2023  financial  year,  the  Company  received  a disclosure from the Japanese company Nissan Finance Co. Ltd that it had exceeded the statutory thresholds of 5%, 10%, 15% and 20% of voting rights.\n\nThe crossing of these thresholds resulted from the entry into force,  on  8  November  2023,  of  a  new  alliance  agreement between  Renault  S.A.  and  Nissan  Motor  Co.,  Ltd.  dated 26 July 2023, as amended and reformulated on 7 November 2023 (the 'New Alliance Agreement').\n\nThe  notification  from  Nissan  Finance  Co.,  Ltd.  dated 10  November  2023  indicated  that  it  held  15%  of  the Company's share capital and 22.13% of its voting rights.\n\nI\n\n06",

There are no plans to request a new authorisation from the Annual General Meeting.\n\n## 6.2.5.2 Performance shares\n\nPursuant  to  Article  L.  225-197-1  of  the  French  Commercial Code,  the  Combined  General  Meeting  of  25  May  2022, authorised, for a period of 38 months, the Board of Directors to grant performance shares, either existing or to be issued, to  employees  of  the  Company  or  to  certain  categories  of such  employees  and  employees  of  the  companies  and groupings related to it, as provided for in Article L. 225-197-2 of the French Commercial Code. For further details on past allocations  and  shares  in  the  process  of  being  acquired, please  refer  to  the  summary  table  in  section  3.2.5.3  of  this Registration Document.\n\n## 6.2.5.3 Share buyback 1\n\nIn  accordance  with  Article  L.  225-209-2  of  the  French Commercial  Code,  the  seventeenth  resolution  of  the Combined General Meeting of 25 May 2022 authorised the Company  to  trade  in  its  own  shares  for  a  maximum  of 18 months.\n\nThe objectives of the programme are to:\n\n- i. cancel all  or  part  of  the  shares  acquired,  in  particular  to offset  the  dilution  linked  to  the  acquisition  of  bonus shares;\n- ii. use all or some of the acquired shares to implement any performance share allocation plan or any other shareholding plan for former and current employees and senior executives of the Company and its Group;\n- iii. tender  all  or  some  of  the  acquired  shares  upon  the exercise of rights attached to scurities granting the right to the allocation of shares of the Company;\n- iv. stimulate  the  secondary  market  or  the  liquidity  of  the Renault share through a liquidity contract; and\n- v. more  broadly,  perform  all  other  transactions  currently admissible, or that would become  authorised  or admissible, by applicable laws or regulatory provisions or by the AMF.\n\n- A. Tradings carried out by Renault in its own shares during the 2023 financial year\n- 1. Stimulation of Renault shares on the regulated secondary market\n\nRenault  S.A.  entrusted  BNP  Paribas  with  implementing  a liquidity  and  market  surveillance  contract  for  its  common stock for one year, with tacit renewal, effective 1 July 2022.\n\nIn 2023, under this liquidity contract, the Company acquired 7,315,535 shares at an average of \u20ac36.88 for a total amount of \u20ac269,793,122 and sold 7,355,407 shares at an average price of \u20ac36.88 for a total amount of \u20ac271,121,643.\n\nOn  16  January  2024,  in  compliance  with  the  applicable regulations, the Company published the half-year report on the liquidity contract as of 31 December 2023, which is also available on its website: www.renaultgroup.com.\n\n## 2. Coverage  of  free  share  allocation  and  employee  share ownership plan\n\nAs  part  of  its  share  buyback  programme  approved successively by the General Meeting of 25 May 2022 and the General Meeting of 11 May 2023, Renault bought back:\n\n- -1,950,000 shares in January 2023,\n- -3,000,000 shares in June 2023,\n- -700,000 shares in September 2023, and\n- -200,000 shares in December 2023.\n\nThe 5,252,892 shares held by Renault at 31 December 2023, outside the liquidity contract, are allocated in their entirety to  the  fulfilment  of  free  performance  share  plans  or  any other  form  of  allocation,  allotment  or  transfer  granted  to employees or senior executives of the Company. The shares acquired by the beneficiaries of share-based compensation (Long-Term  Incentives)  must  not  have  any  effect  on  the share  capital  structure.  Shares  acquired  under  a  free performance share under the buyback programme. The aim is to leave the Company's share capital unchanged.",

At 31 December  2023,  this  was distributed as follows:\n\n- \u25cf the  French  State  held  15.01%  of  the  share  capital corresponding to 22.15% of theoretical voting rights and 22.45% of exercisable voting rights in Renault;\n- \u25cf the  Nissan  group,  through  its  wholly-owned  subsidiary Nissan Finance Co., Ltd., held 15.00% of the share capital corresponding to 22.13% of theoretical voting rights  and 22.43% of exercisable voting rights. However, in accordance  with  the  New  Alliance  Agreement,  the exercisable  voting  rights  attached  to  the  Renault  S.A. shares  held  by  Nissan  are  now  contractually  capped  at 15%  of  the  total  exercisable  voting  rights  in  Renault  S.A. with the possibility for Nissan to freely exercise its voting rights within this limit (see chapter  1.3.3.2 of the Company's 2023 Universal Registration Document);\n- \u25cf Renault's current and former employees owned 5.07% of the  share  capital,  including  4.17%  under  the  Group's savings  plans  (directly  or  through  a  corporate  mutual fund (FCPE)) and 0.90% by employee beneficiaries of free share allocations since the 2016 plan;\n- \u25cf treasury  shares  represented  1.80%  of  the  capital  and,  in accordance with the law, do not carry voting rights;\n- \u25cf the  free  float  represented  63.12%  of  the  share  capital (compared with 64.40% at 31 December 2022); and\n- \u25cf the members of the Board of Directors together and directly hold less than 0.5% of the Company's share capital.\n\nTo  the  best  of  the  Company's  knowledge,  aside  from  The Capital Group Companies, Inc. (5.05%), no other shareholder holds  more  than  5%  of  the  capital  or  voting  rights  at 31 December 2023, directly or indirectly, alone or in concert, other  than  the  French  State,  Nissan  Finance  Co.,  Ltd  and Group employees.\n\nA survey of the shareholders of Renault was conducted as of 31 December 2023.\n\nThis gave an estimated breakdown  of the public ownership's  interest  by  category  of  major  shareholder.  At that date:\n\n- \u25cf the institutional shareholders owned 45.95% of Renault's share capital, it being stated that:\n- -French  institutional  investors  held  9.60%  of  the  share capital;\n- -foreign institutional investors held 36.35% of the share capital; and\n- -the 10 largest French and foreign institutional investors held approximately 20.45% of the share capital.\n- \u25cf the  remaining  public  ownership  in  the  capital  i.e.  17.17% was held primarily by individual shareholders.\n\n## 6.2.6.2 Shareholder agreements on shares and voting rights of the Company\n\nTo the best knowledge of the Company, and as at the date of  this  Universal  Registration  Document,  there  are  no shareholder  agreements  governing  relations  between  the Company's shareholders and no concerted actions.\n\n## Termination  of  the  restrictions  on  the  free exercise of voting rights attached to shares held by the French State\n\nThe Governance Agreement entered into on 4 February 2016 between  Renault  and  the  French  State  and  capping  the exercise of voting rights by the French State was terminated on 8 November 2023.\n\nThis  termination  results  from  the  termination  of  the Restated  Alliance  Master  Agreement  (RAMA)  entered  into between  Renault  and  Nissan  Motor  Co.,  Ltd.  on  28  March 2002 and the possibility for Nissan Motor Co., Ltd. to exercise the voting rights attached to its shareholding in Renault up to a limit of 15% of the exercisable voting rights, following the entry  into  force  on  8  November  2023  of  the  New  Alliance Agreement  entered  into  on  26  July  2023  between  Renault and Nissan Motor Co., Ltd.\n\nThe  French  State  can  now  freely  exercise  at  the  General Meeting of Shareholders all the voting rights attached to its stake in Renault.\n\n## Restrictions on the free exercise of voting rights attached to shares held by Nissan\n\nUnder the terms of the New Alliance Agreement entered into on 26 July 2023 between Renault and Nissan Motor Co., Ltd. and which came into force on 8 November 2023, the voting rights  of  the  Nissan  group  (which  holds  15%  of  Renault's capital  through  its  subsidiary  Nissan  Finance  Co.,  Ltd.)  are capped at 15% of the voting rights exercisable at Renault's General Meetings.\n\n## Restrictions on the acquisition and sale of Renault shares by Nissan\n\nUnder the terms of the New Alliance Agreement, Nissan has a  lock-up  obligation  and  a  standstill  obligation  limiting  its stake in  Renault  to  15%.  Nissan  could  sell  Renault  shares  it holds in certain limited circumstances, in particular if Nissan passively  exceeds  the  threshold  of  15%  of  Renault's  share capital (following a reduction in Renault's share capital) or the lock-up obligation threshold is lowered below 15% as a result of Renault's dilution in Nissan's share capital. In these circumstances,  Nissan's  disposal  of  Renault  shares  should be  done  as  part  of  a  process  organised  and  coordinated with Renault and in which Renault has a right of first offer for its own benefit or for the benefit of a designated third party.\n\nI\n\n06",

Average calculated on end  of  month  figures  for  customer  segment  and  on  daily data on dealer financing\n\nAVES  : Alliance  Vehicle  Evaluation  System:  a  system  of quality checks conducted on new vehicles as they come off the  assembly  lines.  AVES  applies  a  detailed  method comprising  a  static/visual  component  and  a  dynamic component to detect defects.\n\nAvtovaz  : Russian  company,  manufacturer  of  the  Lada brand in which Renault has a controlling interest, via a joint venture, fully consolidated in Renault's financial statements since the end of 2016.\n\nB\n\nBOM: Board  of  Management,  which  was  in  charge  of  the company's  strategic  orientations  and  decisions,  was replaced by the Leadership Team on February 1, 2023.\n\nC\n\nCAFE: Corporate  Average Fuel Economy, which represents the average level of fuel consumption or CO2 emissions for all passenger vehicles sold by a carmaker.\n\nCCT: Cross-Company  Team,  a  team  comprised  of  Renault and  Nissan  representatives  who,  as  part  of  the  Alliance, explore synergy possibilities for the two companies.\n\nCET1: (Common  Equity  Tier  1)  this  ratio  is  a  regulatory indicator of banks' financial soundness, derived from Basel 3.  It  makes  it  possible  to  measure  performance in terms of capital consumption.\n\nCKD  (Completely  Knocked  Down): Supply  chain  principle whereby basic bodywork components and sets of assembly parts are shipped unassembled to faraway plants. The shell is  then  assembled in the body shop, paint shop and trim & chassis shop.\n\nCMF: Common  Module  Family,  a  sharing  principle,  via  a series  of  shared  platforms  of  the  Alliance,  based  on  a modular system of architecture that enables a wide range of vehicles to be built from a smaller pool of parts, creating higher added value for the Group's customers.\n\nCVT: Continuously  Variable  Transmission.  A  gearbox technology  that  enables  the  vehicle  to  run  at  optimum power.  A  CVT  delivers  better  fuel  economy  than  a conventional automatic transmission. It provides a\n\nsmoother, more comfortable driving experience by shifting seamlessly through gear ratios with no break in acceleration.\n\nD\n\nDKD  (Dismantled  Knocked  Down): Supply  chain  principle whereby vehicles are assembled in-plant and then partially disassembled for shipping (front  and  rear  frames,  cylinder block and other parts according to customs duties).\n\nDownsizing: reduction of engine capacity. Optimizing combustion-powered engines remains one of the most economical  ways  of  limiting  fuel  consumption  and,  as  such, reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Downsizing involves reducing the capacity of the engines - and thus fuel consumption and CO2 emissions - while maintaining performance.\n\nE\n\nEBA: Emergency  Brake  Assist.  A  system  that  detects emergency braking situations and instantaneously increases  braking  pressure  to  shorten  the  distance  the vehicle takes to stop.\n\nElectriCity: Renault Group created in 2021 ' Renault ElectriCity ', an  industrial  hub  in  the  north  of  France (manufacturers  in  in  Douai,  Maubeuge  and  Ruitz)  that  has the Group's largest electric vehicle manufacturing capacity in the world.\n\nEquity: The  Group  manages  the  capital  of  the  Automotive segment  excluding  Avtovaz  using  a  ratio  equal  to  the  net debt of the Automotive segment excluding Avtovaz divided by  the  amount  of  equity.  The net  financial  indebtedness includes all non-operating interest-bearing financial liabilities and commitments less cash and cash equivalents and other non-operating financial assets such as marketable securities or the segment's loans. Equity is the amount shown in the Group's financial statement.\n\nEuro NCAP: safety standards for crash tests.\n\nEuro NCAP conducts crash tests to provide consumers with accurate  information  on  the  safety  performances  of  their cars.  Since  2009,  Euro  NCAP  has  given  an  overall  rating  to each  vehicle  tested  with  assessments  of  'Adult  occupant protection', 'Child protection', 'Pedestrian protection' and 'Safety assist'. Euro NCAP publishes information about ESC fitment  and  the  results  of  rear  impact  (whiplash)  tests  in terms of seat design.\n\nEuro 5 and Euro 6: the Euro 5 emission standards are part of the  Euro  emission  standards,  which  set  the  maximum pollutant  emission limits,  excluding  CO2,  for  cars  and  other vehicles.  The  Euro  5  emission  standard  came into effect in September  2009  for  new  car  certifications  and  covers  all new cars since January 2011.  In  2014,  Euro  6,  which  focuses mainly on NOx emissions, took its place.",

        "page_content": "FC: fuel  cell.  Consisting  of  a  nucleus  and  a  single  electron, hydrogen is  the  simplest  and  lightest  of  the  elements.  It  is 14 times lighter than air. In a fuel cell, hydrogen and oxygen are  brought  into  contact  on  either  side  of  a  polymer electrolyte membrane. They combine to produce water, the only  'emission'  of  the  engine,  which  generates  electricity and heat. It is this electrical energy that powers the vehicle's electric engine.\n\nFree  cash  flow is  the  amount  of  cash  generated  by  a company after interest payments, tax and net investments. FCF is used to:\n\n- \u25cf reduce the Net Financial Debt of Automotive;\n- \u25cf pay dividends;\n- \u25cf buy  back  the  company's  own  shares  and  minority interests;\n- \u25cf carry out external growth operations: acquire companies or holdings in associated companies.\n\nThe FCF indicator for the automotive sectors is an indicator defined  and  calculated  based  on  accounting  data  in  the cash  flow  statement.  However,  this  indicator  is  neither defined nor required in IFRS.\n\nThe  Group  has  chosen  to  calculate  this  indicator  on  the basis of the Automotive segments, excluding all items from the sales financing segment, with the exception of dividends paid and capital increases in sales financing.\n\nFree  cash  flow  is  therefore  obtained  from  the  items  in  the statement  of  cash  flows  of  the  automotive  sectors  by adding the following items:\n\nCash  flow  (excluding  dividends  received  from  listed companies  and  including  dividends  received  from  sales finance)\n\n- + change in the working capital requirement\n- + physical and intangible investments net of disposals\n- + change  in  capitalized  leased  assets  (vehicles  and batteries)\n- - subscription to Sales Financing capital increases\n\n## = operational free cash flow of the automotive sectors\n\nFTT: Functional Task Team: a team made up of Renault and Nissan  representatives  who,  within  the  framework  of  the Alliance, provide their respective expertise on management processes, standards and tools.\n\n## G\n\nGEC: The  Group's  Executive  Committee  is  responsible  for the company's strategic guidance and decisions. Renamed Board of Management (BoM) since January 2021.\n\n## H\n\nHSE: Renault  created  an  HSE  division  (Health,  Safety, Environment)  on  September  1,  2016.  Its  task  is  to  converge policies  on  working  conditions,  health,  safety  and  the environment. The mission of this new entity is to ensure the Group's  HSE  governance  by  defining,  in  collaboration  with the business  lines  concerned,  an  overall  policy  and ambitious  progress  objectives  concerning  safety  and working conditions, ergonomics, industrial hygiene and the environment.\n\nHyvia: In June 2021, Renault Group and Plug Power signed an agreement to create a joint venture dedicated to hydrogen mobility. The  company  Hyvia  will  offer  a  complete ecosystem of turnkey solutions, including light commercial vehicles with fuel cells, and charging stations.\n\n## K\n\nKPI: Key Performance Indicators. KPIs are used to measure the  Company's  performance.  They  provide  an  overview  of the Group's performance, which is reported monthly to the GEC. KPIs are the main tool for performance management in each geographical region or business line.\n\n## L\n\nLAB: the  accident  analysis,  biomechanics  and  human behavior  laboratory  known  as  the  desire  to  improve  road safety, drawing on a number of scientific disciplines where physics  and  human  sciences  converge.  Accident  analysis and  research  into  driver  behavior  probe  the  causes  and consequences of  road  accidents  with  a  view  to  improving prevention. Biomechanics endeavors to increase protection for vehicle occupants.\n\nLeadership Team: The Leadership Team is in charge of the company's  strategic  orientations  and  decisions.  Replaces the BOM (Board of Management) on February 1, 2023\n\n## M\n\nMateriality  matrix: the  materiality  matrix  is  a  tool  which enables prioritization of extra-financial stakes with strategic  reach.  By  conducting  a  materiality  analysis,  the Company  works  on  the  subjects  that  have  a  (potentially) extensive and significant impact on its business model, and then translate these (as far as possible) into indicators. The methodology  used  must  be  comprehensible,  reproducible and transparent.\n\n## N\n\nNEDC  : New  European  Driving  Cycle  est  une  norme europ\u00e9enne de mesure des \u00e9missions et de la consommation  et  une  m\u00e9thode  normalis\u00e9e  bas\u00e9e  sur  des tests  d'essais  identiques  pour  tout  type  de  v\u00e9hicule  en Europe. Elle constitue donc un crit\u00e8re objectif pour mesurer les \u00e9carts de performance entre les mod\u00e8les des diff\u00e9rents constructeurs. Le v\u00e9hicule est mis sur un banc \u00e0 rouleaux et on lui fait subir trois fois le m\u00eame cycle urbain (cycle ECE-15), puis  une  fois  le  cycle  dit  extra-urbain.
