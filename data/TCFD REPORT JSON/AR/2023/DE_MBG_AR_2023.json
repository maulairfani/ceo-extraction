We were able to assert ourselves strongly in this environment. This is also reflected in our balance sheet. We also continued to make progress in the implementation of our strategy.\n\nOur company has shown that we can achieve solid financial results even under difficult conditions. In 2023 sales of all-electric cars of the Mercedes-Benz brand increased by 73%. The proportion of electrified vehicles in total car sales was 20%. Mercedes-Benz Group AG has also initiated important projects to expand the charging infrastructure in our core markets. The direct sales model was rolled out in additional markets. Following the introduction of our conditionally automated driver assistance system in the United States, we also received approval to test the technology for motorway use in Beijing. Moreover, we were able to achieve another significant part of our targeted reduction in fixed costs.\n\nThese successful developments are also reflected in our annual results. Our revenue amounted to \u20ac153 billion. However, EBIT fell by 4% to \u20ac19.7 billion. Our net liquidity in the industrial business was \u20ac31.7 billion. The bottom line was a net profit of \u20ac14.5 billion. The Board of Management and the Supervisory Board will recommend a dividend of \u20ac5.30 per share to the Annual General Meeting.\n\nThese figures are the result of the exceptional commitment of our employees. Without their dedication and ability the successes of the year 2023 would not have been possible. The thanks of the entire Board of Management goes to all of our colleagues.\n\nLooking ahead, what topics are on our agenda?\n\nWe want to take our customers' brand experience to the next level. To this end, we are redesigning our showrooms all over the world. We are also expanding our global network of exclusive locations, through which we want to make our brands even more tangible. To ensure maximum convenience and full transparency for car purchasing, we are continuing to roll out our direct sales model. For an outstanding product",

That's why we are building our own fast-charging network. We want to install more than 10,000 charging points in our core markets by the end of the decade. The aim of all these measures is to fulfil our brand promise at all points of contact with our customers and create special Mercedes moments.\n\nIn our view, our most important task is to build the world's most desirable vehicles. The focus is on the upper end of the segments in which we are represented. That's why we are taking targeted steps to strengthen our portfolio in 2024. The premi\u00e8re of our electric G-Class will be a highlight. We are also launching the Maybach version of the EQS SUV in key markets. At AMG, we are presenting further variants of our new topof-the-line AMG GT model. And at Mercedes-Benz, we are further enhancing the substance of our electric cars in the luxury segment in areas ranging from efficiency and comfort to design.\n\nThe pace of the transformation to electric mobility is determined by market conditions and our customers' requirements. We will be prepared for every kind of market scenario. The motto for the production of our vehicles with combustion engines is 'tactical flexibility'. When it comes to electric mobility, our strategic course is to create the preconditions for becoming all-electric.\n\nWe have laid the foundations for this course. The development of multiple new vehicle platforms is in full swing. This will take our electric cars and vans to the next level. We will start in the entry-level segment in 2025 with the new electric CLA. This will set new standards in terms of range, efficiency and charging speed. At the same time, our own operating system MB.OS will celebrate its premi\u00e8re. Thus we will also reach an important milestone in terms of software. Our customers can now look forward to an even more natural, more personal and more extensive interaction with their Mercedes-Benz.\n\nIn 2023 we made our company even more resilient and achieved significant strategic progress. In addition, we can build on an outstanding brand and a powerful team. All of these are excellent prerequisites for our ongoing promotion of the profitable, all-electric and software-driven future of Mercedes-Benz. We would be delighted to have you accompany us on this journey.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nOla K\u00e4llenius",

Bernd Pischetsrieder Chairman of the Supervisory Board of Mercedes-Benz Group AG\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Dear Shareholders,\n\n2023 was a year full of challenges for Mercedes-Benz Group and the entire automotive industry. The market environment was demanding, and a large number of external factors influenced the economy, presenting employees with complex tasks.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, the past year has clearly proven that the true strength of a team only becomes apparent when the headwinds increase. The team at MercedesBenz Group has once again proven that it is one of the best and I would like to take this opportunity to express my sincere gratitude to all employees for their outstanding commitment and dedication.\n\nIn 2024, the company will continue to drive the transformation in line with its sustainable business strategy. Whether equipped with a all-electric drivetrain or a combustion engine - Mercedes-Benz Group is committed to offering its customers the most desirable cars in the world. And I am convinced that such cars will continue to be recognized by the Mercedes star in the future.\n\n## Supervisory and advisory activities of the Supervisory Board\n\nIn the 2023 financial year, the Supervisory Board of Mercedes-Benz Group AG again performed, in full, the duties incumbent upon it by law, the articles of association and the rules of procedure.\n\nIn this context, the Supervisory Board continuously advised and monitored the Board of Management in the management of the company and provided support on strategically important issues for the further development of the company.\n\nThe Supervisory Board reviewed whether the individual company and Consolidated Financial Statements, the Combined Management Report including the NonFinancial Declaration and the other financial reporting complied with the applicable requirements.\n\nFurthermore, after careful review and consultation, it approved numerous business transactions subject to its consent. This related in particular to the approval of the establishment of a Europe-wide high-performance charging network under the Mercedes-Benz brand. It also included financial and investment planning, product",

The Board of Management informed the Supervisory Board about a large number of other measures and business transactions and discussed them intensively and in detail with the Supervisory Board; for example, the effects on the company of supply bottlenecks for certain battery systems as well as the initiated countermeasures.\n\nThe Board of Management regularly informed the Supervisory Board about all significant business developments of the Group and the divisions. During the reporting period, it kept the Supervisory Board continuously informed about all fundamental issues regarding corporate planning, including financial, investment, sales and personnel planning; current developments at Group companies; the development of revenue; the situation of the company and the divisions; the economic and political environment; and the current status and assessment of significant legal proceedings. In addition, the Board of Management continuously reported to the Supervisory Board on the profitability and liquidity situation of the company, the development of sales and procurement markets, the overall economic situation and developments on the capital markets and in the financial services sector. Other topics included the further development of the product portfolio, securing the long-term competitiveness of the company and the further implementation of measures to ensure sustainable, future-oriented mobility. The Supervisory Board also dealt in detail with the political developments and conflicts in the main sales markets and the reaction to\n\nthem in terms of business policy, the shareholder structure, the share-price development and its background, as well as the expected effects of the strategic projects on the share-price development.\n\n## Working culture and areas of Supervisory Board activity\n\nIn the 2023 financial year, the Supervisory Board held seven meetings. Six meetings were held in person, with the option of participation in virtual form or via telephone, and one meeting was held as a video conference. Meeting attendance by the members was at a very high level, as can be seen in the detailed overview at the end of this report. The work of the Supervisory Board was characterized by open and intensive dialogue. The members of the Supervisory Board regularly prepared for upcoming resolutions using documents provided in advance by the Board of Management. The employee and shareholder representatives also regularly prepared the meetings in separate discussions, which were also attended by members of the Board of Management. In addition, the Supervisory Board was supported in depth by its Committees. At the meetings of the Supervisory Board, its members discussed the measures and transactions to be resolved in detail with the Board of Management. Executive sessions were regularly scheduled for the meetings so that topics could be discussed also in the absence of the Board of Management.\n\nThe Supervisory Board was informed of special events outside the regular meetings. In addition, some members of the Supervisory Board and the Board of\n\nManagement held bilateral meetings to exchange views. The Board of Management also informed the Supervisory Board of the key indicators of the business development and of existing risks by means of written reports.\n\nThe members of the Supervisory Board assume responsibility for their training and further education measures in areas such as changes in the legal framework and new, forward-looking technologies that are required for the performance of their tasks and are supported in this by the company. In the reporting period, for example, the company held information events on sustainable corporate governance and sustainability reporting as well as on the Mercedes-Benz operating system MB.OS. Both internal and external experts were involved in these events. In addition, new members of the Supervisory Board have the opportunity to meet the members of the Board of Management and senior executives with specialist responsibility in a specifically designated onboarding programme for a bilateral exchange on fundamental and current topics in respect of the relevant areas of the Board of Management, thus gaining an overview of the topics relevant to the company and of the governance structure. ESG (environmental, social and governance) and sustainability-related thematic blocks are also an integral part of this programme. Furthermore, the members of the Supervisory Board are regularly informed about the regulatory environment relevant to their work on the Supervisory Board and other legal developments affecting them.",

In the presence of representatives of the auditor, the Supervisory Board then discussed the preliminary key figures of the 2022 company and Consolidated Financial Statements as well as the preliminary proposal to the 2023 Annual General Meeting for the appropriation of profits and noted them with approval. The Supervisory Board determined that there were no objections to their publication. The preliminary key figures for the 2022 financial year and the preliminary proposal for the appropriation of profits were published at the annual press conference on 17 February 2023. The Supervisory Board also passed resolutions relating to a number of other measures subject to its approval. To optimize the capital structure, the Supervisory Board approved the Board of Management's plan to buy back up to \u20ac4 billion worth of the company's own shares via the stock exchange over a period of up to two years and subsequently cancel them. This was done on the basis of the authorization granted by the Annual General Meeting on 8 July 2020. In addition, the Board of Management provided information on the status of the fulfilment of the settlement in connection with diesel emissions agreed with the US authorities. Moreover, the body dealt with the remuneration of the Board of Management on the basis of the remuneration system to be approved by the Annual General Meeting.\n\nAt the meeting on 13 March 2023, the Supervisory Board discussed the Annual Financial Statements, the\n\nConsolidated Financial Statements and the Combined Management Report, including the Non-Financial Declaration for the 2022 financial year of Mercedes-Benz Group AG and the Group, each of which had been issued with an unqualified audit opinion by the auditor, as well as the Declaration on Corporate Governance, the Remuneration report, and the proposal for the appropriation of profits. The members of the Supervisory Board were provided with extensive documentation for their preparation.\n\nThe Audit Committee and the Supervisory Board reviewed these documents in detail and discussed them intensively in the presence of the auditors, who reported on the results of their audit and also addressed the key audit matters and the relevant audit procedures, including the conclusions drawn, and were available for additional questions and information. Following the final result of the review by the Audit Committee and its own review, the Supervisory Board concurred with the result of the audit by the auditor. It determined that there were no objections to be raised and adopted the Annual Financial Statements prepared by the Board of Management and the Combined Management Report, including the Non-Financial Declaration. The 2022 company financial statements of Mercedes-Benz Group AG were thus adopted. On this basis, the Supervisory Board endorsed the proposal of the Board of Management for the appropriation of distributable profits. The Supervisory Board also adopted the Report of the Supervisory Board, the Declaration on Corporate Governance and the Remuneration Report, as well as its proposed resolutions on the agenda items\n\nfor the 2023 Annual General Meeting. In order to meet the expectations of investors to improve shareholder participation, it was decided, among other things, to again publish a letter from the Supervisory Board Chairman to shareholders concerning a number of governance issues in the run-up to the Annual General Meeting.\n\nAt its meeting on 28 April 2023, the Supervisory Board received reports on the supply situation for certain battery systems and the measures that were taken. The Board of Management also provided information on the positive reactions to the company's ESG conference for investors and analysts, which was held on 30 March 2023. The Supervisory Board also received a status update on vehicle IT security and discussed findings from cyber incidents at other commercial enterprises. The Chief Officer Corporate Data Protection also reported on the Data Compliance Management System, the opportunities and risks of using artificial intelligence and dealing with digital risks. The Supervisory Board then discussed ESG management within the company in detail, in particular the further integration of sustainability into the company's structures and core processes. The Supervisory Board subsequently approved the development of a wind farm project as part of a power purchase agreement at the test site in Papenburg in northern Germany. Finally, the Supervisory Board also discussed current legal issues.",

At the subsequent Supervisory Board meeting, I proposed to the Supervisory Board, in the interests of long-term, orderly succession planning, that Dr Martin Bruderm\u00fcller be elected Chairman of the Supervisory Board after my term of office expires at the end of the Annual General Meeting in 2024. Ergun L\u00fcmali was confirmed as Deputy Chairman of the Supervisory Board. This was done in view of the election of employee representatives that was held before the 2023 Annual General Meeting. In addition, elections were held to fill vacancies on the committees of the Supervisory Board.\n\nThe Supervisory Board held another meeting at the end of July 2023. At this meeting, the Supervisory Board and the Board of Management discussed in detail the course of business and the results of the first half of the year. In addition, the body decided to adjust the remuneration of the Board of Management on the basis of the remuneration system approved by the Annual General Meeting. Moreover, the Supervisory Board was informed about current legal issues and the status of the fulfilment of the settlement in connection with diesel emissions agreed with the US authorities.\n\n## Strategy meeting of the Supervisory Board\n\nAt the start of the two-day strategy meeting on 27/28 September 2023, the Supervisory Board was informed about the current situation of the company. As part of the ESG reporting, the Board of Management then reported on overarching topics, the latest developments, objectives and selected key topics related to 'E', 'S' and 'G'. The Supervisory Board also decided on product projects and an investment project subject to its approval. The meeting focused on the company's strategy and, in particular, its implementation. Topics discussed included the product and innovation strategy, offering a holistic customer experience along the entire customer journey, transforming and empowering the workforce for the future and securing industrial competitiveness. With the involvement of the responsible executives, the members of the Supervisory Board and the Board of Management discussed in a constructive and open dialogue how the Mercedes-Benz Group will adapt to new challenges and which opportunities are to be exploited. Sustainability-related aspects, such as challenges in the implementation of human rights due diligence in the supply chains for production materials, were an integral part of the discussions. The capital market perspective was also taken into account.\n\nBy way of resolution with the aid of other customary means of communication, on 23 October 2023 the Supervisory Board approved the Board of Management's plans to establish a Europe-wide high-performance charging network under the Mercedes-Benz brand.\n\n## Corporate planning meeting (Mercedes-Benz business planning)\n\nAt the meeting on 13 December 2023, the Supervisory Board discussed and approved the Mercedes-Benz business planning on the basis of comprehensive documentation and discussed existing opportunities and risks in connection therewith. The agenda also included the Board of Management's report on the current financial status, volumes and prices of the vehicle clusters in the current and future Mercedes-Benz Cars portfolio and the Supervisory Board's resolution on several measures subject to its approval. The body also discussed the Board of Management's report on the development of current and completed acquisitions and collaborations and was informed about the results of the employee survey conducted in 2023. Other topics discussed at the meeting included remuneration issues, corporate governance matters and legal issues.\n\n## Corporate governance and declaration of compliance\n\nDuring the 2023 financial year, the Supervisory Board continuously addressed the standards of good corporate governance.\n\nIn order to take account of the constantly growing complexity and increasing legal relevance of sustainability-related issues and to create a central point of contact for all relevant stakeholders, the Supervisory Board decided in July 2023 to establish a cross-divisional steering and coordination function for sustainability management in the company at the Board of Management level.

Responsibility for the management of division-specific sustainability issues remains with the respective Board of Management divisions.\n\nIn my function as Chairman of the Supervisory Board, I held discussions with investors and proxy advisors on Supervisory Board-specific topics such as Board of Management remuneration and the work and composition of the Supervisory Board and its committees as part of the investor dialogue in the run-up to the Annual General Meeting.\n\nIn December 2023, the Supervisory Board adopted the regular 2023 declaration of compliance. With the exceptions explained there, all recommendations of the Code have been and are being complied with.\n\nIn the interests of good corporate governance, the members of the Supervisory Board of Mercedes-Benz Group AG are required to disclose to the Supervisory Board as a whole any conflicts of interest, in particular those that could arise as a result of an advisory or board function with customers, suppliers or lenders of Mercedes-Benz Group AG or other third parties.\n\nThere were no indications of actual conflicts of interest during the 2023 financial year.\n\nThe Supervisory Board regularly assesses how effectively the Supervisory Board and its committees\n\nperform their duties. In the reporting period, a comprehensive self-assessment of the Supervisory Board and its committees took place with the involvement of an external consultant on the basis of an extensive questionnaire and additional interviews carried out. The Board of Management's perspective was also included in this assessment. The results of the audit, which the Supervisory Board dealt with extensively at its meeting on 21 February 2024, confirm that the members of the Supervisory Board cooperate very effectively and professionally with one another and with the Board of Management and do so on a basis of great trust.\n\nThe Audit Committee also conducted a self-evaluation of its activities on the basis of a comprehensive company-specific questionnaire in 2023. The positive results of this self-assessment were presented and discussed at the Audit Committee meeting on 21 February 2024.\n\n## German Act on the Equal Participation of Women and Men in Leadership Positions\n\nFor supervisory boards of listed companies subject to codetermination and equal representation of shareholders and employees on the supervisory board, such as that of Mercedes-Benz Group AG, the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG) prescribes a mandatory gender quota of at least 30%. The quota is to be met by the Supervisory Board as a whole.\n\nAs at 31 December 2023, women make up 30% of the shareholder side of the Supervisory Board of MercedesBenz Group AG (Liz Centoni, Dame Polly Courtice and Professor Dr Helene Svahn), while the remaining 70%\n\nare men. On the employee side, Nadine Boguslawski, Gabriela Neher and Monika Tielsch make up 30% women and the remaining 70% are men. Thus the Supervisory Board as a whole also fulfils the statutory quota.\n\nAt its meeting on 13 December 2023, the Supervisory Board decided on the recommendation of the Nomination Committee, to propose to the 2024 Annual General Meeting that Dr Doris H\u00f6pke be elected to the Supervisory Board for the first time. If the proposed female candidate is elected, the proportion of women on the shareholder side will increase to 40%. The statutory gender quota would remain fulfilled both on the shareholder side and for the Supervisory Board as a whole.\n\nOn 3 December 2020, the Supervisory Board set a target for the proportion of women on the Board of Management of at least 25% by 31 December 2025. Since August 2022, a legally mandated minimum participation requirement must be complied with when appointing members of the Board of Management. This requirement stipulates that at least one woman (and at least one man) must be a member of the Board of Management in listed companies with parity participation and more than three members on the Board of Management. Companies that are subject to the minimum proportion requirement are no longer obliged to set a target quota for the proportion of women on the board of management. Nevertheless, within the framework of the overall requirements profile for appointments to the Board of Management, the Supervisory Board has decided to go beyond the stipulations of the minimum proportion",

The proportion of women on the Board of Management is now 37.5%, which means it exceeds the target that was set.\n\nCorporate governance at the Mercedes-Benz Group is explained in detail in the Declaration on Corporate Governance.\n\n## Work in the committees\n\nThe Presidential Committee held four meetings in the past financial year. Two of the meetings were held in person and two meetings were held as video conferences. In particular, the Committee discussed personnel matters and succession planning for appointments to the Board of Management. Furthermore, the Presidential Committee discussed the acceptance by members of the Board of Management of board positions at other companies and institutions, corporate governance issues, D&O insurance and remuneration issues.\n\nThe Audit Committee held six meetings in the year 2023.

In those meetings, the Committee was informed in detail about legal matters relating to emissions and cartels and discussed these matters in the presence of the legal advisers of the Supervisory Board. It discussed the continuing further development of the technical compliance management system, also with respect to future technologies. The Committee received reports on the progress of the review of potential responsibilities in connection with diesel emissions and anti-trust matters from the legal advisers engaged for this purpose by the Supervisory Board. The Committee regularly reported to the Supervisory Board on its work and, after discussing and weighing the relevant aspects, made recommendations for resolutions to the Supervisory Board, taking the Group's best interests into account. The Committee also discussed the risks of a limitation of possible liability and took appropriate measures in the cases in point. As part of the settlement reached with the US authorities in connection with diesel emissions, the Committee was assigned specific tasks and decision-making competences with regard to the fulfilment of the obligations assumed in the settlement. The Committee also fulfilled these tasks in full and with great care.\n\nThe Nomination Committee held two meetings in the 2023 financial year, both of them as video conferences. The Committee specifically considered the recommendations for the proposals of the Supervisory Board to\n\nthe Annual General Meeting regarding the election of shareholder representatives to the Supervisory Board. In this context, it was guided by the interests of the company, taking all circumstances of the individual case into account, and striving to fulfil the overall profile of requirements, along with the diversity concept and competence profile for the entire Supervisory Board.\n\nDuring the reporting period, there was no reason to convene the Mediation Committee .\n\n## Changes in the Supervisory Board and the Board of Management\n\nSeveral members of the Board of Management were reappointed in the course of the financial year.

In doing so, the company focuses on innovative and forward-looking technologies and safe high-quality vehicles that fascinate and excite.\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz Group comprises the automotive business units Mercedes-Benz Cars and Mercedes-Benz Vans as well as Mercedes-Benz Mobility. Each business unit pursues a strategy that is specifically targeted at the market and customers it serves. The strategy in question is based on the principles of sustainability, integrity and diversity and is supported by a highly qualified and motivated team.\n\n## Sustainability, integrity and diversity are the basis of our conduct at the Mercedes-Benz Group\n\nSustainability at the Mercedes-Benz Group means creating permanent value for all of our stakeholders for our customers, investors and employees and for our business partners and society as a whole. In this process, economic, environmental and social responsibility belong together - along the entire value chain. In order to live up to this responsibility, the Mercedes-Benz\n\n- 1 Net carbon-neutral means that no CO2 emissions are caused or that any CO2 emissions arising are compensated for by certified offset projects.\n\nGroup utilizes a holistic ESG (environmental, social and governance) concept throughout all of its divisions.\n\nOne of the company's goals here is to reduce CO 2 emissions per passenger car over the entire vehicle life cycle by the end of this decade by up to 50% as compared to 2020 levels. In addition to the comprehensive use of recycling materials and renewable energy in production, the integration of renewable energy sources for charging the vehicles and electrification of the vehicle fleet is an important tool for accomplishing this. This is why the Mercedes-Benz Group is taking the necessary steps to go all electric. Customers and market conditions will set the pace of the transformation. The Mercedes-Benz Group plans to be in a position to cater to different customer needs, whether it's an all-electric drivetrain or a combustion engine, until well into the 2030s. In addition, the company's factories are retooled to follow demand and can capture the tipping point into an all-electric era. The Mercedes-Benz Group expects its high power charging network to ease the ramp-up of electromobility. The Group will expand battery production and open a battery recycling factory to close the loop. The Mercedes-Benz Group's ambition is to make the entire new vehicle fleet net carbon-neutral 1 across all stages of the value chain by 2039.\n\nThis holistic ESG approach is accompanied by social and governance aspects such as the transformation of the workplace and upholding human rights.\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz Group is convinced that long-term success can only be achieved by acting in an ethically and legally responsible manner. Integrity is therefore very important to the company. For the Mercedes-Benz Group, ethical behaviour means doing what is right, complying with external and internal rules, following our moral compass and aligning our activities with shared values.\n\nDiversity is the third foundation of our conduct at the Mercedes-Benz Group. The Group is convinced that sustained success can only be achieved with diverse teams. Through the use of appropriate measures and activities, the Mercedes-Benz Group seeks to foster a work environment that offers equal opportunities to all employees.",

Indeed, if the transformation is to be successfully shaped, a team that is ready and willing to embrace change and continuously extend its knowledge and skills needs to be in place. The company therefore puts lifelong learning and the further education of employees at the centre of its sustainable personnel development approach. As an attractive employer, the company also offers flexible working conditions, varied assignments and a variety of development opportunities in the context of a culture of cooperation based on trust. With its People Principles, the company defines how to communicate, lead and collaborate.\n\n## Mercedes-Benz Cars Strategy\n\nMercedes-Benz Cars' goal is to build the world's most desirable cars. The division aligns its actions in pursuit of this goal with six strategic pillars.\n\n## Think and act like a luxury brand\n\nLuxury has always been part of Mercedes-Benz' DNA, and the company's thoughts and actions will focus even more strongly on it in the future. Mercedes-Benz Cars' claim is to offer the most desirable vehicles on the basis of a combination of pioneering technologies, exceptional aesthetics and integrated sustainability.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## To Our Shareholders\n\nObjectives and Strategy\n\nIn this manner, the company also makes a connection between two essential characteristics - its strong roots as an automaker that has created numerous style-defining icons, and the pioneering spirit with which Mercedes-Benz Car is driving the further development of the automobile. Mercedes-Benz underscores its role here through its standing as the world's most valuable luxury automotive brand in the latest Best Global Brands ranking from 2023. With the improvement from eighth to seventh place in the rankings of the world's most important brands, the company has once again boosted the brand value by nine per cent as compared to the previous year.\n\nOur goal for the future is a brand that embodies the many facets of the lives of our customers - from lifestyle and technology to the digital realm, mobility and culture - and does this by working together with cultural pioneers in a manner that is as inspired as it is unexpected. We intend to achieve this goal by creating an emotional bond with the Mercedes-Benz Cars brands and getting people excited about them in connection with every product and in every encounter we have with customers and anyone who is interested in or is a fan of the brand.\n\n## Focus on profitable growth\n\nMercedes-Benz Cars wants to make the transformation towards an all-electric future profitable and to continue its growth in the lucrative market segments. A clear positioning as a luxury brand helps to maintain higher profitability across all product categories - Entry, Core\n\nand Top-End. Along with a clear focus on the customer, the important ways in which this can be accomplished are focusing and further developing the portfolio, achieving strong pricing, and securing the margins. These means will also be employed for the systematic electrification of our models throughout the entire Mercedes-Benz brand portfolio. Further profitable growth is also being targeted in the highly profitable product categories in particular. The consistent positioning as a luxury brand will also be used to achieve Mercedes-Benz Cars' goal of sustainable high profitability as a division that can rely on its resilient business system, even in challenging times.\n\n## Expand customer base by growing Top-End Luxury\n\nIn the Top-End segment, Mercedes-Benz Cars boasts an extraordinary brand portfolio that goes beyond the Mercedes-Benz core brand. This portfolio also includes the Mercedes-AMG and Mercedes-Maybach brands, as well as the iconic G-Class product brand. The Mercedes-Benz Cars Strategy will be used to unfold the full potential of the Mercedes-Benz brand portfolio, accelerate the development of the Top-End product category and achieve additional EBIT growth. Brand-specific formats and customer experiences are also to be used to address new target groups. At the same time, even stronger interrelationships are to be established between the brands, in order to exploit synergies in customer communications, for example.\n\n## Embrace customers and grow lifetime revenues\n\nIn order to intensify and further boost customer loyalty, the division is systematically creating unique customer experiences along its entire customer journey and addressing customers in an individualized and datadriven manner within the Mercedes-Benz ecosystem. One of the basic preconditions for this is comprehensively digitalized sales and service processes that, for example, are enabled by the stepwise transformation of sales to the agency model. In this way, all channels online and offline, and from consulting to service - are to be adapted to the dynamic customer requirements and flexibly developed further. Moreover, customers are to be provided with tailored and market-specific offers that enthuse them about more than just the purchase of vehicles. These offers include such things as after-sales services and spare parts as well as over-theair (OTA) updates and digital extras. In this way, Mercedes-Benz Cars intends to continuously enhance the attractiveness of its products, safeguard their value retention and increase the company's revenue throughout the product life cycle.",

        "page_content": "## Lead in electric drive and digital experience\n\nMercedes-Benz Cars is endeavouring to become a leader for electric mobility and the digital experience. The division is creating the essential preconditions for becoming all-electric, with ambitious product development goals and the market launch of new locally emission-free and software-driven technologies. The ,electric-first' platform MMA which will be launched next year, marks the next step into the electric future of Mercedes-Benz Cars. The platforms MB.EA and AMG.EA will follow. Thus, Mercedes-Benz Cars will offer our customers an all-electric alternative for each model.\n\nMercedes-Benz Cars' expertise in the field of electric mobility is to be extended, and the vertical integration will also be increased by insourcing drive-system technologies for electric vehicles. To ensure efficient production and promote the future development of battery cells and modules, the division plans to work together with partners to build various battery cell production plants worldwide. Mercedes-Benz also purchases battery cells from various partners on the world market to supply its global production network. The company thus has access to the latest technologies on the market.\n\nIn order to further underscore the claim to leadership with regard to the digital experience, and to meet customers' needs even better in future, Mercedes-Benz Cars plans to introduce its own data-based and updatable Mercedes-Benz Operating System (MB.OS) when it launches the MMA platform. In this way, the customers\n\nwill be able to access a unique brand experience that includes special new digital extras and product features while control of the interface with customers can remain in the Mercedes-Benz ecosystem. MB.OS will create the basis for an even faster and more flexible response to customer requirements in the future, including during a product's life cycle. Another aim is to establish smart connectivity between the vehicle, the cloud and the IoT world (Internet of Things). Data security and data protection play a key role for MercedesBenz Cars here.\n\nMercedes-Benz Cars is also striving to establish leadership in assistance technologies and customer experience in conditional driving automation. Customers are offered not only enhanced ride comfort and safety but also an increasing reduction of driver stress and the freedom to carry out certain activities while driving. Today, with DRIVE PILOT, Mercedes-Benz Cars already meets the demanding legal requirements for conditional driving automation according to SAE Level 3 (pursuant to UN R157) - the first automotive company in the world to do so. Mercedes-Benz Cars has even gone one step further where parking is concerned: the INTELLIGENT PARK PILOT preinstallation is a series-production system that already enables completely automatic driverless parking (Automated Valet Parking) according to SAE Level 4 in Germany.\n\n## Lower cost base, improve industrial footprint and increase supply chain resilience\n\nThe continued systematic pursuit of our profitability and cash-flow objectives is a fundamental component of the successful and sustained transformation of the company. Mercedes-Benz Cars seeks to further optimize its break-even point and take additional steps towards reducing the cost base and improving the industrial footprint. To this end, work is also proceeding on further reducing fixed and variable costs as well as on lowering the investments in property, plant and equipment.\n\nMercedes-Benz Cars is also shifting its capital allocation with its sustainable business strategy. The implementation of further cost reductions by standardizing battery platforms and creating scalable vehicle architectures is planned. Mercedes-Benz Cars also aims to play a more active role along its supply chains in order to safeguard and increase the resilience of these business activities.",

We want the vans from Mercedes-Benz to represent far more than a capital investment and to continue arousing enthusiasm. The strategy is based on four pillars:\n\n## Target premium segments and focus on profitable growth\n\nMercedes-Benz Vans has extensively shaped the van market worldwide since the very beginning. As part of the Mercedes-Benz brand family, the division continuously sharpens its profile as a supplier of future-oriented transport solutions for commercial and private customers. Vans in the private segment are aligned with the luxury positioning strategy of Mercedes-Benz Cars, while commercial vans are marketed within the framework of a premium strategy.\n\nIn both the commercial and the private segments, Mercedes-Benz Vans stands for the highest levels of quality, reliability and sustainability. A key element of the strategy is the increased focus on high-sales and high-margin markets and segments. In parallel with the expansion of its activities in Europe, the division also intends in future to further intensify its efforts in China and North America. In addition, Mercedes-Benz Vans plans to focus more strongly on the growing premium segments in the most profitable sectors and to enter into attractive segments at the upper end of the portfolio through partnerships with body manufacturers.\n\n## Embrace customers and grow lifetime revenues\n\nMercedes-Benz Vans plans to ensure a high level of profitability by means of a modified business model for sales and a customer-focused service portfolio. The focus here will be on pushing direct sales in order to reduce selling expenses. With regard to the new-vehicle business, Mercedes-Benz Vans is increasingly making\n\nuse of online sales channels. This involves using the existing Mercedes-Benz Cars Online Store platform and expanding it to include van-specific features. One measure here will make it possible for customers to place follow-up orders quickly and easily directly online. Another goal is to generate additional revenue potentials at all points of customer contact: from advice to sales and after-sales services.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Starting in 2026, the VAN.EA is a new, electric-only architecture which is intended to provide the basis for all future mid-size and large vans for both private and commercial use.\n\nMercedes-Benz is currently developing its own operating system MB.OS - a flexible, modular and service-based chip-to-cloud architecture that will enable B2B-specific software solutions. Mercedes-Benz Vans expects that MB.OS will also enable it to quickly expand and optimize its digital extras and services. In addition, the operating system will serve as the foundation for the development of automated driving functions for Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) Level 2 and up. On the basis of MB.OS and the technical possibilities it offers, the division plans to achieve conditional driving automation for private customers in accordance with SAE Level 3 by the end of the decade. The objective is to be able to offer partially automated driving in accordance with SAE Level 2 with the introduction of vehicles based on VAN.EA. With regard to the commercial segment, Mercedes-Benz Vans is looking to achieve highly automated driving in accordance with SAE Level 4 by the end of the decade in order to exploit the business potential of fully automated (driverless) transport.\n\n## Lower the total cost base and improve the industrial footprint\n\nMercedes-Benz Vans has launched a comprehensive cost initiative at company, production and product level in order to maintain profitability at a high level and to improve competitiveness. The goals here include significantly optimizing production processes and lowering production costs. This is to be achieved mainly by reducing the complexity of the product portfolio and focusing on efficiency in core production processes.\n\nMercedes-Benz Vans is also reorganizing its production network in order to become more efficient and flexible and to prepare the network for an electric future. The first manufacturing plant solely for all-electric vans in Jawor, Poland, will set new standards worldwide for productivity, lean processes and sustainability. The reorganization of the production network will enable Mercedes-Benz Vans to react quickly to changing market conditions in the future while at the same time optimizing its cost structure.\n\nThe strategic actions follow three principles:\n\n## Guided by economic, environmental and social sustainability\n\nMercedes-Benz Vans has also made sustainability an integral part of its strategy. One of the main goals formulated in Ambition 2039 is to make the fleet of new private and commercial vans net carbon-neutral over the entire life cycle by 2039.\n\n## Accelerated by digitalization and data-driven business\n\nMercedes-Benz Vans intends to use the comprehensive digital strategy to exploit the potential of the digital transformation as effectively as possible. Among other things, this includes the optimal design of the digital customer experience, the expansion of the digital product and service portfolio as well as the digitalization of internal business processes - all while ensuring that data is used responsibly. In all of its activities, Mercedes-Benz Vans aims for the maximum networking and synergy effects with Mercedes-Benz Cars.\n\n## We are the key to our success\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz Vans People Principles place people and the team at the centre of our transformation. These principles create the framework for communication, leadership and collaboration and require the commitment and the innovative power of our employees. In addition, Mercedes-Benz Vans offers its employees qualification measures for future-oriented topics.",

Sustainability is a fundamental principle and a firm component of the Mercedes-Benz Cars business strategy - a principle that characterizes all of our business activities. The Mercedes-Benz Group believes that the complete electrification of its product range is the most important means of making its entire new vehicle fleet net carbon-neutral 1 across all stages of the value chain by 2039. Mercedes-Benz Cars is creating the essential preconditions for complete electrification and accelerating the transformation into a software-driven and all-electric future.\n\nTo this end, the electric platform Electric Vehicle Architecture (EVA) was introduced in 2021. Beginning in the middle of the decade, the Mercedes Modular Architecture (MMA) platform, which is primarily focussed on electric mobility with vehicles starting with the Entry segment, is to follow. In 2026, Mercedes-Benz Cars plans to introduce two more all-electric platforms (BEV platform generations) in the Top-End and Core segments: the Mercedes-Benz Electronic Architecture (MB.EA) and the AMG Electronic Architecture (AMG.EA).\n\nMercedes-Benz Cars offers a broad range of products that are spread out among the three product categories of Top-End, Core and Entry. The Top-End 2 portfolio\n\n- 1   Net carbon-neutral means that no CO2 emissions are caused or that any CO2 emissions arising are compensated for by certified offset projects.\n\nencompasses Mercedes-AMG, Mercedes-Maybach, the G-Class, the S-Class, the EQS Sedan, the GLS and the EQS SUV. Core represents the heart of the brand and comprises the Mercedes-Benz C-Class and E-Class model ranges and their derivatives. The Entry A-Class and B-Class models and their derivatives offer customers a point of entry into the compact vehicle portfolio.\n\nIn addition to the Mercedes-Benz brand, the brand portfolio encompasses the brands Mercedes-AMG and Mercedes-Maybach, as well as the G-Class product brand. Mercedes me provides access to the digital services of Mercedes-Benz Cars.\n\nThe division also continues to move ahead at a fast pace with the intelligent networking of its vehicles and the development of autonomous driving systems. In order to further underscore the claim to leadership with regard to the digital experience, Mercedes-Benz Cars plans to introduce its own data-based and updatable Mercedes-Benz Operating System (MB.OS) when it launches the MMA platform.\n\nAlong with its production sites in Germany, MercedesBenz Cars also operates major manufacturing facilities in the United States, Hungary, Mexico and South Africa. Production operations in China are carried out by the associated company Beijing Benz Automotive Co., Ltd. (BBAC).\n\nThe most important markets for Mercedes-Benz Cars in 2023 were China with 36% of unit sales, the United States with 15%, Germany with 11% and the other European markets (European Union, United Kingdom, Switzerland and Norway) with 21%.\n\n## Mercedes-Benz Vans\n\nMercedes-Benz Vans is a global manufacturer of a comprehensive van portfolio.

        "page_content": "## Performance measurement system\n\nVarious targets are defined on the basis of the Mercedes-Benz Group's corporate strategy and business strategy. The Group's performance measurement system is oriented towards the achievement of these targets. Along with financial aspects, they include sustainability-related targets in particular.\n\nThe information provided below primarily relates to the Group's financial performance measurement system. Information on the sustainability targets and the measures being taken to achieve them can be found in the chapter Non-Financial Declaration.\n\n## Objective\n\nThe financial performance measurement system used at the Mercedes-Benz Group is designed to ensure that our investors' interests and expectations are taken into account within the framework of a value-based management system. The value added is based on this principle. It shows the extent to which the Group and its divisions achieve or exceed the return requirements of the investors. Due to the only indirect relationship of value added to ongoing business operations, the value drivers of the value added are utilized as financial performance indicators for the periodic controlling of the Group and its divisions.\n\nValue added can be calculated as the difference between the measure of operating profit (EBIT or net operating profit) and the cost of capital of the average net assets.\n\n## Calculation of value added\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe return on net assets (RONA) is calculated from the ratio of EBIT to net assets. Value is created for our shareholders when RONA exceeds the cost of capital. The required rate of return on net assets, and thus the cost of capital rate, is derived from the minimum rates of return that equity investors and lenders expect on their invested capital. In contrast to cost of capital rates based on peer-group logic for purposes of the impairment test at the level of the cash-generating units, when determining the Group cost of capital rate for deriving the value added, the focus is on the use of company-specific data (in particular with respect to the capital structure). For 2023, the Group's cost of capital rate amounted to 9% after taxes. For the automotive divisions, this cost of capital rate stood at 13% before taxes; for Mercedes-Benz Mobility, a cost of equity of 13% before taxes was applied.\n\n## Cost of capital rates\n\n|                                      | 2023   | 2022   |\n|--------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| in %                                 |        |        |\n| Group, after taxes                   | 9      | 8      |\n| Automotive divisions, before taxes   | 13     | 12     |\n| Mercedes-Benz Mobility, before taxes | 13     | 12     |\n\nThe quantitative development of value added and the related financial performance measures are explained in the chapter Profitability.",

        "page_content": "## Financial performance measures\n\n## Profit measure\n\nThe measure of operating profit at the divisional level is EBIT (earnings before interest and income taxes). EBIT thus reflects the divisions' responsibility for profit and loss. EBIT that is calculated at the Group level takes into account centrally managed matters and eliminations.\n\nIn order to provide a more transparent presentation of our ongoing business, adjusted EBIT is also calculated and reported for both the Group and the divisions. The adjustments include individual items insofar as they lead to material effects in a reporting year. These individual items can relate in particular to legal proceedings and related measures, restructuring measures and M&A transactions.\n\nGroup EBIT minus the centrally managed income taxes equals net operating profit. The chapter Profitability shows how net operating profit is calculated.\n\n## Return on sales\n\nAs one of the main factors influencing value added, return on sales is of particular importance for assessing the profitability of the automotive divisions. Return on sales is the ratio of EBIT to revenue, and vehicle sales are the primary source of revenue. The measure of profitability for Mercedes-Benz Mobility is not return on sales but return on equity (the ratio of EBIT to average equity on a quarterly basis). On the basis of adjusted EBIT, an adjusted return on sales is reported for the\n\nautomotive divisions and an adjusted return on equity is reported for Mercedes-Benz Mobility.\n\n## Net assets\n\nAll assets, liabilities and provisions for which the automotive divisions are responsible in day-to-day operations are allocated to them. Performance measurement at Mercedes-Benz Mobility is implemented on an equity basis. Net assets at the Group level include the net operating assets of the automotive divisions and the equity of Mercedes-Benz Mobility, as well as assets and liabilities from income taxes and other reconciling items which are not allocated to the divisions. The average annual net assets are calculated on the basis of the average quarterly net assets.\n\n## Cash flow\n\nA change in net assets - for example as a result of investments - generally leads to the application or release of liquid funds. Along with earnings, net assets thus also have a direct effect on the cash flow. Of outstanding importance for the financial strength of the Mercedes-Benz Group is the free cash flow of the industrial business, which comprises the cash flows at the automotive divisions and the cash flows from interest, taxes and other reconciling items that cannot be allocated to the divisions. The operating cash flow before interest and taxes (CFBIT) for the automotive divisions is derived from EBIT and the change in net assets. The cash conversion rate (CCR) is the ratio of CFBIT to EBIT over a period of time and is an important measure for cash-flow management at the automotive divisions.\n\nIn order to provide a more transparent presentation of our ongoing business, the adjusted free cash flow of the industrial business and the adjusted CFBIT of the automotive divisions are also calculated and reported. An adjusted cash conversion rate (adjusted CCR) on the basis of adjusted CFBIT and adjusted EBIT is presented for the automotive divisions. The adjustments include individual items insofar as they lead to material effects in a reporting year. These individual items can relate in particular to legal proceedings and related measures, restructuring measures and M&A transactions.",

As of the year 2024, the share of electrified vehicles (xEV) from Mercedes-Benz Cars and from Mercedes-Benz Vans respectively, measured on the basis of the unit vehicle sales of these divisions, will be used as key non-financial performance indicators.

        "page_content": "## Economic Conditions and Business Development\n\n## The world economy and automotive markets\n\n## The world economy\n\n## General economic conditions\n\nThe world economy performed better throughout the reporting year than had been expected at the beginning of the year - and although global growth of 2.7% was somewhat lower than in the previous year (3%), it was only slightly below the long-term trend. The adverse effects on growth that resulted from the steep and synchronized tightening of monetary policy by many central banks was offset to some degree by supportive fiscal policies and lower prices for energy and raw materials. At the same time, major differences were observed between regions, and even within regions in some cases. The main reason for the positive development of the world economy overall was the unexpected resilience of the US economy in the face of an extremely restrictive monetary policy, although major emerging markets such as India and Brazil were also able to exceed expectations in this regard. On the other\n\nhand, the European and the Chinese economies displayed relatively weak development during the year under review. Given these circumstances, global trade volume not only slowed but also contracted by around 2% in 2023 as compared to the previous year.\n\nThe US economy successfully defied recession risks during the reporting year. Growth remained strong despite the fact that the country's central bank - the Fed - raised its policy rate throughout the course of the year by a further 100 basis points to 5.5%. Private consumption in particular developed dynamically and was supported by generous fiscal programmes and pandemic-era excess savings. Inflation also continued to decline - at an average of 4.1%, it was significantly lower than in the prior year, but it still remained above the Fed's target. This development, along with substantial wage increases, had a positive effect on disposable income. Thanks to robust domestic demand, the US economy recorded growth of 2.5% for the year as a whole in 2023.\n\nThe economy in the euro zone developed much less dynamically, although the burden caused by high energy prices was noticeably less pronounced in 2023\n\nthan it was in the prior year. Still, the industrial sector remained under extreme pressure and shrank significantly over the year as a whole. Private consumption stagnated across many sectors due to ongoing high, albeit decreasing, inflation and rising interest rates. Inflation in the euro zone averaged 5.4% for the year as a whole, which was still much higher than the central bank target of approximately 2%. The European Central Bank thus continued its tight monetary policy, raising the main refinancing rate throughout the course of the year by a further 200 basis points to 4.5%. Economic activity in the euro zone advanced slightly during the first half of the year, due, among other things, to the ongoing post-pandemic recovery and fewer supply chain disruptions. However, output then declined marginally during the second half of the year, with the result that the economy in the euro zone recorded growth of only 0.5% for 2023 as a whole.\n\nFollowing the end of the zero-COVID policy in China, the Chinese economy started the year with a strong recovery that it was unable to maintain. The recovery was ultimately curbed by the pronounced weakness of the Chinese real estate sector and the associated crisis of confidence among consumers. Nevertheless, thanks",

        "page_content": "to government support measures and an easing in monetary policy, China was able to achieve its growth target, with GDP up by 5.2% on the year. Unlike the case in the United States and Europe, the Chinese economy was faced with slight deflationary tendencies - consumer prices rose by only 0.2% in the country for the year as a whole.\n\n## Development of exchange rates\n\nExchange rates were volatile in this environment. Against the US dollar, the euro moved between USD 1.05 and USD 1.13 in the course of the year. At the end of 2023, the euro was around 3% stronger than at the end of 2022. The range of fluctuation of the Chinese renminbi against the euro was 7.2 to 8.1. Year-on-year, the value of the euro increased by around 6% against the renminbi.\n\n## Energy and raw material prices\n\nPrices for oil and gas declined significantly from their record levels in 2022, but they remained very volatile nevertheless. The oil price fell below USD 80 per barrel at the end of the year, which was almost 9% lower than at the end of 2022. The average price for the year as a whole was about 17% lower than in the previous year. Gas prices in Europe also fell noticeably. The price at the end of the year - approximately \u20ac32 - was almost 60% lower than the price at the end of 2022 but still higher than the price before the pandemic. Prices for industrial raw materials also tended to decrease further over the year and at the end of the year were a little less than 3% below the prices recorded at the end of 2022.\n\n## Automotive markets\n\nThe economic conditions described above also affected the development of the global automotive market in the year under review. Nevertheless, sales markets were able to partially buck the trend of the overall economic slowdown. In particular, the normalization of global vehicle production, as well as the order backlog that still existed in some cases in the aftermath of the pandemic, boosted the development of sales last year. Customer demand, in contrast, weakened in many automotive markets throughout the year.\n\nAgainst this background, the global car market volume overall was significantly higher than in the previous year. Several different regions contributed to this global increase in volume. The European market recovered noticeably, with market volume increasing significantly by 14% from the low level recorded in the prior year. The US market for light vehicles also registered significant growth of 12% compared to the previous year, while the Chinese market recorded a slight increase of approximately 6%.\n\nThe factors mentioned above also affected the development of key van sales markets . In Europe, the combined segment for mid-size and large vans, as well as the segment for small vans, recorded a significant increase. The US market for large vans also increased significantly in volume compared to the previous year. Sales figures for mid-size vans in China were also significantly higher than in the previous year, although growth in that market was largely a result of the introduction of new vehicle models by relevant competitors.",

(BBAC), which is an equity-method investment. A total of 339,500 vehicles were sold in North America (2022: 344,200). Unit sales in the region's main market, the United States, amounted to 298,000 vehicles and were thus at the prior-year level (2022: 300,800).\n\n## Mercedes-Benz Vans\n\nMercedes-Benz Vans sold 447,800 vehicles worldwide in 2023 (2022: 415,300), thus setting a new record.\n\nAll model series contributed to the growth in sales here. The large vans (Sprinter/eSprinter) recorded a significant increase in sales to 237,400 units (2022: 217,400). Sales of mid-size vans (Vito/eVito, V-Class/EQV) totalled 178,900 units (2022: 175,500). Sales of small vans (Citan/eCitan, T-Class/EQT 1 ) amounted to 31,500 units (2022: 22,500).\n\nWorldwide, it proved possible to significantly increase unit sales of electrified vans to 22,700 units (2022: 15,000 units). These were exclusively all-electric models. The share of electrified vehicles thus accounted for a 5% share of total unit sales (2022: 4%).\n\nAt 279,400 units, sales in Europe (European Union, United Kingdom, Switzerland and Norway) were significantly above the prior-year level (2022: 259,400). Unit sales in Germany amounted to 114,000 vehicles (2022: 113,200). Mercedes-Benz Vans also set a new sales record in the United States with unit sales of 75,100 vehicles (2022: 66,400). In China, unit sales totalled 33,400 vehicles (2022: 34,200).\n\n## Mercedes-Benz Mobility\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz Mobility division had a contract volume of \u20ac135.0 billion - slightly above the previous year's figure - at the end of 2023 (31 December 2022: \u20ac132.4 billion, +2%; +4% after adjusting for exchangerate effects). The figure for contract volume shows the total monetary amount of all leasing and financing contracts on a certain date.\n\nMercedes-Benz Mobility concluded 1.4 million new financing and leasing contracts worth a total of \u20ac62.0 billion in the course of 2023. The total value of all new contracts was thus slightly higher than in the prior year (31 December 2022: \u20ac58.0 billion, +7%; +10% after adjusting for exchange-rate effects). The main reason for the positive development was the higher average financing and leasing volume per contract, driven by improved pricing on the sales side and a higher proportion of electrified and Top-End vehicles in the new business.\n\nIn the German market, new business was roughly on a par with the previous year at \u20ac10.4 billion (+2%).\n\nContract volume amounted to \u20ac24.5 billion (-3%). The US market benefited from a higher average financing and leasing volume per contract and a significant increase in the penetration rate. The penetration rate indicates the proportion of leased and financed vehicles in the Group's unit sales. At \u20ac16.2 billion (+25%), the volume of new business at the end of 2023 was considerably higher than the figure recorded in the prior year. At \u20ac35.7 billion, contract volume at the end of December 2023 was slightly higher than at the end of 2022 (+3%). In China, on the other hand, increased competition in the financial services sector caused new business to decrease by 18% compared to the prior year to \u20ac9.8 billion. At \u20ac16.7 billion, contract volume was also significantly lower than in the previous year (-15%). New business in other markets totalled \u20ac25.6 billion (+11%), while contract volume amounted to \u20ac58.1 billion (+10%).\n\n## Order situation\n\nIncoming orders at Mercedes-Benz Cars at the end of 2023 were at the same level as in 2022. The new E-Class in particular made a positive contribution to the order situation.\n\nThe volume of incoming orders at Mercedes-Benz Vans at the end of 2023 was lower than in the previous year; this was due in particular to the overall economic situation. The order situation is thus at a normal level after several previous years that were marked by positive one-off effects.",

The industrial business comprises the automotive segments Mercedes-Benz Cars and Mercedes-Benz Vans. The effects from intra-Group eliminations between the industrial business and Mercedes-Benz Mobility, as well as items at the corporate level, are generally allocated to the industrial business. In justified individual cases, effects on the profitability, liquidity and capital resources, and financial position of the corresponding segment are presented from an economic rather than a legal perspective.\n\nIn order to provide a more transparent presentation of the ongoing business, adjusted figures are also calculated and reported for both the Group and the segments. The adjustments generally include individual items insofar as they lead to material effects in a reporting year. These individual items can relate in\n\nparticular to legal proceedings and related measures, restructuring measures and M&A transactions. Further information on the performance measurement system can be found in the Corporate Profile chapter.\n\n## Profitability\n\n## Consolidated Statement of Income\n\nIn 2023, the revenue amounted to \u20ac153.2 billion (2022: \u20ac150.0 billion) and was thus slightly higher than in the prior-year. The increase was primarily due to higher unit sales and improved pricing at the Mercedes-Benz Vans segment. Revenue in the Mercedes-Benz Cars segment was also higher, primarily due to a further improvement in pricing. Negative exchange-rate effects caused revenue to decline.\n\nCost of sales amounted to \u20ac118.8 billion (2022: \u20ac116.0 billion) in 2023, increased by 2.4% compared with the previous year. The increase was mainly due to expenses to suppliers because of additional costs relating to inflation and supply chains.\n\n## Revenue by segment and region\n\n|                         | 2023    | 2022    | 23/22    |\n|-------------------------|---------|---------|----------|\n| In millions of euros    |         |         | % change |\n| Mercedes-Benz Group     | 153,218 | 150,017 | 2        |\n| Segments                |         |         |          |\n| Mercedes-Benz  Cars     | 112,756 | 111,601 | 1        |\n| Mercedes-Benz  Vans     | 20,288  | 17,217  | 18       |\n| Mercedes-Benz  Mobility | 26,718  | 26,954  | -1       |\n| Reconciliation1         | -6,544  | -5,755  | 14       |\n| Regions                 |         |         |          |\n| Europe                  | 61,895  | 56,487  | 10       |\n| thereof Germany         | 25,799  | 23,085  | 12       |\n| North  America          | 40,488  | 40,091  | 1        |\n| thereof United States   | 36,041  | 35,829  | 1        |\n| Asia                    | 43,382  | 45,558  | -5       |\n| thereof China           | 25,284  | 27,324  | -7       |\n| Other  markets          | 7,453   | 7,881   | -5       |\n\n- 1 The reconciliation includes eliminations of intra-Group revenue between the segments.",

        "page_content": "By contrast, lower raw material prices had a positive impact on the cost of sales. Moreover, refinancing costs at Mercedes-Benz Mobility rose due to higher interest rates. In the prior year, cost of sales was negatively impacted by expenses in connection with the discontinuation of the business activities in Russia.\n\nOverall, gross profit in relation to revenue increased from \u20ac34.0 billion to \u20ac34.4 billion.\n\nSelling expenses increased by \u20ac0.2 billion to \u20ac9.7 billion. As a proportion of revenue, selling expenses remained unchanged at 6.3%.\n\nIn the past year, general administrative expenses increased by \u20ac0.1 billion to \u20ac2.7 billion. As a proportion of revenue, general administrative expenses increased from 1.7% to 1.8%.\n\nResearch and non-capitalized development costs of \u20ac6.2 billion in 2023 were above the prior-year level (2022: \u20ac5.6 billion). The increase was mainly due to higher expenses in connection with advance expenditure for the renewal of existing models and the further development of fuel-efficient and environmentally friendly drive systems as well as the digital connectivity of the products. As a proportion of revenue, research and non-capitalized development costs increased from 3.7% to 4.1%. Further information on this topic is provided in the Investment and research activities chapter of this Combined Management Report.\n\nance\n\nKonzernabschluss\n\nWeitere Informationen\n\nOther operating income of \u20ac1.7 billion (2022: \u20ac2.0 billion) was below the level of the prior year. The figure included expenses in the amount of \u20ac0.2 billion in connection with the discontinuation of business activities in Russia. The prior-year earnings included total income of \u20ac0.9 billion in connection with the restructuring of the sales activities in Canada and the change in the shareholding structure of the motorsport business. By contrast, other operating income in the prior year was impaired by the result attributable to the spin-off and hive-down of assets and liabilities of the Daimler commercial vehicles business of the Mercedes-Benz Mobility segment. The resulting loss (before deduction of transaction costs) amounted to \u20ac0.2 billion.\n\nIn 2023, the gains/losses on equity-method investments amounted to \u20ac2.1 billion (2022: \u20ac1.7 billion) and were thus above the prior-year level. The positive development was mainly due to the higher proportionate earning of the investment in Daimler Truck Holding AG. In financial year 2023, earnings totalled \u20ac0.8 billion (2022: \u20ac0.2 billion). In addition to higher current earnings, the increase compared to the previous year is partly due to lower negative adjustments at the Group from an investor's perspective. In 2022, the earnings included income of \u20ac59 million from the contribution of approximately 5% of the shares in Daimler Truck to the Mercedes-Benz Pension Trust. In contrast, the result of Beijing Automotive Co., Ltd. decreased to \u20ac1.5 billion (2022: \u20ac1.7 billion).\n\nThe other financial income/expense was below the previous year's level at \u20ac0.1 billion (2022: \u20ac0.3 billion),\n\nmainly due to higher expenses from the discounting of non-current provisions.\n\nEarnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) amounted to \u20ac19.7 billion in 2023, which is slightly lower than in the previous year (2022: \u20ac20.5 billion).\n\nDue to the global increase in interest rates, net interest income/expense improved to an income of \u20ac0.4 billion (2022: expense of \u20ac0.2 billion) in 2023.\n\nThe tax expense of \u20ac5.6 billion (2022: \u20ac5.5 billion) remained at the prior-year level. The effective tax rate for the reporting year was 27.6% (2022: 27.1%).\n\nNet profit was thus \u20ac14.5 billion (2022: \u20ac14.8 billion). Net profit of \u20ac0.3 billion is attributable to non-controlling interests (2022: \u20ac0.3 billion). The net profit attributable to shareholders of Mercedes-Benz Group AG amounted to \u20ac14.3 billion (2022: \u20ac14.5 billion), leading to a decrease in earnings per share to \u20ac13.46 (2022: \u20ac13.55). The calculation of earnings per share is based on an average number of 1,059.6 million issued shares (2022: 1,069.8 million issued shares). The decrease in the weighted average number of shares in circulation is due to the share buyback programme resolved by the Board of Management on 16 February 2023.\n\nFurther information on the individual items of the Consolidated Statement of Income is provided in Notes 4 ff. of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.",

        "page_content": "## EBIT by segment\n\nThe EBIT of the Mercedes-Benz Cars segment decreased to \u20ac14,224 million (2022: \u20ac16,340 million); adjusted EBIT was \u20ac14,252 million (2022: \u20ac16,245 million). With a revenue of \u20ac112,756 million (2022: \u20ac111,601 million), the adjusted return on sales of 12.6% was lower than the adjusted prior-year figure of 14.6%.\n\nImproved pricing and lower raw material prices had a positive impact on gross profit. On the other hand, gross profit was impacted by expenses paid to suppliers due to additional costs relating to inflation and supply chains over the course of the year. In addition, exchange-rate effects had a negative impact on earnings. Gross profit in relation to revenue decreased from 23.9% to 23.4% as a result. Other functional costs increased in 2023. This was mainly due to advance expenditure for the renewal of existing models and the further development of fuel-efficient and environmentally friendly drive systems as well as the digital connectivity of the products. In addition, increased expenses from the discounting of non-current provisions as well as lower equity-method gains of the stake in Beijing Benz Automotive Co., Ltd. contributed to a decrease in earnings.\n\nance\n\nKonzernabschluss\n\nWeitere Informationen\n\nAdjusted EBIT was slightly higher than EBIT in the year 2023. Effects from ongoing regulatory and legal proceedings and measures relating to Mercedes-Benz diesel vehicles of \u20ac94 million (2022: \u20ac110 million) negatively impacted the segment's earnings. Earnings in connection with the discontinuation of the business activities in Russia in the amount of \u20ac66 million (2022: expense of \u20ac658 million) had a positive impact. In addition, in the prior year, M&A transactions in the amount of \u20ac863 million had a positive effect on the profit due to the \u20ac478 million from the restructuring of the sales activities in Canada and the \u20ac385 million from the change in the shareholding structure of the motorsport business.\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz Vans segment achieved an EBIT of \u20ac3,138 million (2022: \u20ac1,897 million); adjusted EBIT was \u20ac3,063 million (2022: \u20ac1,927 million). With a revenue of \u20ac20,288 million (2022: \u20ac17,217 million), the adjusted return on sales of 15.1% was higher than the adjusted prior-year figure of 11.2%.\n\nThe substantial rise in unit sales as well as improved pricing had a very positive impact on gross profit. However, the result was impacted by higher material costs and expenses for higher transportation costs to global sales markets. Furthermore, earnings reflected the highly inflationary macroeconomic situation, particularly the hyperinflation in Argentina. Overall, gross profit in relation to revenue increased from 21.3% to 24.6%. Other functional costs were slightly above the level of the previous year.\n\nAdjusted EBIT was slightly lower than EBIT in the year 2023. Effects in connection with ongoing governmental and court proceedings and measures taken relating to Mercedes-Benz diesel vehicles led to an impact in the amount of \u20ac70 million (2022: expense of \u20ac15 million) on earnings. In addition, income in the amount of \u20ac5 million (2022: expense of \u20ac51 million) resulted in connection with the discontinuation of business activities in Russia. In the prior year, M&A transactions in connection with the restructuring of the sales activities in Canada contributed \u20ac36 million to earnings.\n\nIn 2023, EBIT of the Mercedes-Benz Mobility segment amounted to \u20ac1,302 million (2022: \u20ac2,428 million); adjusted EBIT was \u20ac1,695 million (2022: \u20ac2,428 million). Revenue amounted to \u20ac26,718 million (2022: \u20ac26,954 million). Adjusted return on equity of 12.3% was below the adjusted prior-year figure of 16.8%.\n\nThe main reasons for the development of EBIT in 2023 were an decreased interest margin due to higher interest rates and increased competition in the financial services sector. Falling used car prices reduced Athlon's remarketing result. Exchange-rate effects and expenses for the expansion of the charging activities also reduced EBIT. The equity-method gains of the mobility investments improved due to a better operating business result and restructuring measures. Despite a challenging macroeconomic environment, credit risk costs were slightly below the previous year's level.",

Expenses of \u20ac276 million in connection with the discontinuation of the business activities in Russia had a negative effect on earnings. In addition, the equity-method gains/losses were negatively impacted by an impairment (\u20ac117 million).\n\nance\n\nKonzernabschluss\n\nWeitere Informationen\n\nThe reconciliation of the segments' EBIT to Group EBIT comprises items at the corporate level and the effects on earnings of eliminating intra-Group transactions between the segments.\n\nIn 2023, items at the corporate level resulted in earnings of \u20ac858 million (2022: expense of \u20ac225 million). This includes the positive effect on earnings of \u20ac797 million (2022: \u20ac226 million) from the equity-method investments in Daimler Truck Holding AG. On the other hand, in the previous year, earnings were affected by adjustments in connection with the sale of individual investments and business activities to Daimler Truck (\u20ac268 million after subtracting transaction costs). Further information on this is provided in Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nThe elimination of intra-Group transactions resulted in earnings of \u20ac138 million in 2023 (2022: \u20ac18 million).",

        "page_content": "## Value added and return on net assets\n\nAs described in the section Performance measurement system, value added is calculated as the difference between the measure of earnings and the cost of capital. The cost of capital used in the calculation of value added is based on average net assets multiplied by the cost of capital rate. The ratio of earnings to net assets results in the profitability of net assets, i.e. the return on capital employed (return on net assets, RONA).\n\nThe measure of earnings for the segments is EBIT and for the Group is net operating profit, which in addition to the EBIT of the segments also includes earnings effects for which the segments are not accountable, such as income taxes and other reconciling items.\n\nance\n\nKonzernabschluss\n\nWeitere Informationen\n\nThe following table shows value added for the Mercedes-Benz Group and for the individual segments.\n\n## Value added\n\n|                      | 2023   | 2022   | 23/22   |\n|----------------------|--------|--------|---------|\n| In millions of euros |        |        | Change  |\n\n| Mercedes-Benz Group    | 8,844   | 10,236   | -1,392   |\n|------------------------|---------|----------|----------|\n| Mercedes-Benz Cars     | 8,841   | 11,757   | -2,916   |\n| Mercedes-Benz Vans     | 2,975   | 1,791    | +1,184   |\n| Mercedes-Benz Mobility | -488    | 692      | -1,180   |\n\nThe value added of the Mercedes-Benz Group in the reporting year amounted to \u20ac8.8 billion (2022: \u20ac10.2 billion), representing a return on net assets of 23.8% (2022: 25.5%). This was once again significantly higher than the Group's required cost of capital rate of 9% (2022: 8%). The value added of the Mercedes-Benz Group decreased, mainly due to the negative development of EBIT of the segments Mercedes-Benz Cars and Mercedes-Benz Mobility. The \u20ac1.3 billion increase in average net assets also had a slightly negative effect on value added. This was partly offset by the positive development of EBIT at Mercedes-Benz Vans.\n\nAt the Mercedes-Benz Cars segment, value added of \u20ac8.8 billion was below the prior-year amount of \u20ac11.8 billion. RONA amounted to 34.4% (2022: 42.8%). This was primarily due to the negative earnings development. The segment's average net assets, which at \u20ac3.2 billion, were higher than in the previous year, increased the negative effect on the value added. This was mainly due to higher average inventories and decreasing average provisions for other risks.\n\nThe value added of the Mercedes-Benz Vans segment increased significantly from \u20ac1.8 billion to \u20ac3.0 billion. RONA amounted to 250.4% (2022: 214.4%). This was mainly due to the very positive earnings development. The average net assets showed an opposing increase to \u20ac1.3 billion, which was primarily due to increased average inventories and decreasing average provisions for other risks.\n\nAt the Mercedes-Benz Mobility segment, value added amounted to minus \u20ac0.5 billion (2022: \u20ac0.7 billion). The segment's return on equity was 9.5% (2022: 16.8%). The development of the return on equity primarily reflects the decrease in earnings. By contrast, the decrease in average total equity had a slightly positive effect on the return on equity.",

        "page_content": "## Liquidity and capital resources\n\n## Principles and objectives of financial management\n\nFinancial management at the Mercedes-Benz Group consists of capital structure management, cash and liquidity management, market-price risk management (foreign exchange-rates and interest rates), as well as pension-asset management and credit and country risk management. Worldwide financial management is performed within the framework of legal requirements consistently for the Group entities by the Treasury department of the Mercedes-Benz Group. Financial management operates within a framework of guidelines, limits and benchmarks, and on the operational level is organizationally separate from other financial functions such as settlement, financial controlling, reporting and accounting.\n\nCapital structure management designs the capital structure of the Group and its subsidiaries. Decisions regarding the capitalization of the Mercedes-Benz Group companies are based on the principles of cost-optimized and risk-optimized liquidity and capital resources.\n\nance\n\nKonzernabschluss\n\nWeitere Informationen\n\nLiquidity management aims to ensure the Group can meet its payment obligations at any time. For this purpose, the Group records the cash flows from operating and financial activities in a rolling plan. The resulting financial requirements are covered by the use of appropriate instruments for liquidity management (e.g. bank credit, commercial paper and notes); liquidity surpluses are invested in the money market or the capital market taking into account risk and return expectations. Our goal is to ensure the level of liquidity regarded as necessary at optimal costs. Besides operational liquidity, the Mercedes-Benz Group maintains additional sources of liquidity which are available in the short term. Those additional financial resources include a pool of receivables from the financial services business which are available for securitization in the capital market and a contractually confirmed syndicated credit facility. Since December 2021, the Group also has liquidity reserves in the form of its shareholding in Daimler Truck Holding AG, which can only be sold with the consent of Daimler Truck Holding AG until the end of 2024. Consent to the sale is not required in the event of a crisis or after December 2024.\n\nCash management centrally determines the cash requirements and surpluses. By means of cash-pooling procedures, liquidity is in general centrally concentrated on bank accounts of the Mercedes-Benz Group in various currencies. Most of the payments between companies of the Group are made through internal clearing accounts so that the number of external cash flows is reduced to a minimum. The Mercedes-Benz Group has established standardized processes and systems to manage its bank accounts and internal cash-clearing accounts, and to execute automated payment transactions.\n\nManagement of market-price risks aims to limit the impact of fluctuations in foreign exchange-rates and interest rates on the earnings of the divisions and the Group. The Group's overall exposure to these market-price risks is initially determined in order to provide a basis for hedging decisions. These include the volume to be hedged, the period to be hedged and the choice of hedging instruments. The hedging strategy is specified at Group level and uniformly implemented. The decision-making body is the Treasury Risk Management Committee, which meets regularly.",

        "page_content": "Management of pension assets (plan assets) includes the investment of the assets to cover the corresponding pension obligations. The plan assets are legally separated from the Group's assets and are invested primarily in funds; they are not available for general business purposes. The plan assets are spread across a broad range of investment categories such as equities, fixed-interest securities, alternative investments and real estate, depending on the expected development of pension obligations and with the help of risk-return optimization. The performance of the asset management is measured by comparison with defined benchmark indices. The investment risks are limited via a Group-wide policy. In addition, there are local regulations for risk management for the individual plan assets. Additional information on pension plans and similar obligations is provided in Note 22 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nance\n\nKonzernabschluss\n\nWeitere Informationen\n\nThe risk volume that is subject to credit risk management includes the Mercedes-Benz Group's worldwide creditor positions with financial institutions, issuers of securities and customers in the financial services business, as well as trade receivables. Credit risks with financial institutions and issuers of securities arise primarily from investments executed as part of our liquidity management and from the application of derivative financial instruments. The management of these credit risks is mainly based on an internal limit system that reflects the creditworthiness of the respective financial institution or issuer. The credit risk with customers of the automotive business results from relationships with contracted dealerships and general agencies, other corporate customers and retail customers. In connection with the export business, general agencies that according to the creditworthiness analyses are not sufficiently creditworthy are generally required to provide collaterals such as first-class bank guarantees. The credit risk with end customers in the financial services business is managed by Mercedes-Benz Mobility on the basis of a standardized risk-management process. In this process, minimum requirements are defined for the sales-financing and leasing business and standards are set for credit processes, as well as for the identification, measurement and management of risks. Key elements for the management of credit risks are appropriate creditworthiness assessments supported by statistical risk-classification methods, as well as structured portfolio analysis and portfolio monitoring.\n\nFinancial country risk management includes various aspects: the risk from investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures, the risk from the cross-border financing of Group companies in high-risk countries and the risk from direct sales to customers in those countries. The Group has an internal rating system that assigns the countries in which it operates to risk categories. Risks from cross-border receivables are partially protected with the use of letters of credit and bank guarantees in favour of Mercedes-Benz Group AG and other Group companies. In addition, an internal committee sets and restricts the level of hard-currency credits granted to Mercedes-Benz Mobility companies in high-risk countries.\n\nFurther information on the management of market-price risk, credit risk and liquidity risk is provided in Note 33 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.",

On the other hand, effects in connection with the recognition and measurement of rightof-use assets, which result from lessee accounting and are largely non-cash items, are included in the free cash flow of the industrial business. Other adjustments relate to effects from the financing of the Group's own dealerships and effects from internal deposits within the Group. In addition, the calculation of the free cash flow of the industrial business includes the cash flows to be shown under cash flow from financing activities in connection with the acquisition or disposal of interests in subsidiaries without loss of control.\n\nIn 2023, the free cash flow of the industrial business amounted to \u20ac11.3 billion and was thus higher than the previous year's figure of \u20ac8.1 billion.\n\nThe increase in the free cash flow of the industrial business by \u20ac3.2 billion to \u20ac11.3 billion compared to the previous year is characterized by an improvement in profit before income taxes of the industrial business. During the reporting period, a positive effect resulted from the development of the working capital, mainly due to a lower inventory build-up and a decrease in the trade receivables compared to the previous year. A smaller increase in trade payables compared to the previous year had an opposing effect.\n\nIn the previous year, the free cash flow was also impacted by higher payments resulting from the settlement of civil and environmental claims made by several US authorities in 2020 in connection with emission control systems used in certain diesel vehicles as well as higher payments in connection with restructuring measures. Another positive effect resulted from a lower increase in the number of leased vehicles compared to the previous year. Moreover, higher dividend payments were received during the reporting period from equity-method investments, in particular Daimler Truck Holding AG and Beijing Benz Automotive Co., Ltd. Investments in and disposals of shareholdings and other business operations resulted in slightly higher cash inflows in the reporting period than in the previous year.\n\nThere was an increase in income taxes paid in comparison to the prior year, which resulted from the improvement in earnings before taxes in the industrial business. In addition to payments to the tax authorities, income tax payments also include intra-Group payments and refunds based on contractual arrangements within the tax groups. A further negative effect on the free cash flow of the industrial business resulted from the higher investment in intangible assets and capital expenditure on property, plant and equipment.",

The decrease in the free cash flow of the Mercedes-Benz Group was mainly due to the higher leasing and sales-financing business of Mercedes-Benz Mobility compared to the previous year. This was offset by a year-on-year increase in the free cash flow of the industrial business.\n\nIn 2022, a cash inflow in the amount of \u20ac1.3 billion which related to the payments received from the sale of intercompany loans in connection with the sale of units of the truck financing business and does not legally relate to Mercedes-Benz Mobility, was economically allocated to the cash flow from investing activities of Mercedes-Benz Mobility . An opposing repayment of the financing liabilities in the same amount was recognized in the cash flow from financing activities of Mercedes-Benz Mobility. In 2023, there were no reclassifications of cash flows between the cash flows from investing activities of the industrial business and Mercedes-Benz Mobility.\n\n## Cash flow from financing activities of the Mercedes-Benz Group\n\nA cash outflow of \u20ac8.4 billion (2022: \u20ac19.0 billion) resulted from the cash flow from financing activities (see condensed statement of cash flows) during the reporting period. The lower cash outflow relative to the same period of the prior year is primarily due to the significantly lower net refinancing in the prior year. This was offset during the reporting period by the payments of \u20ac1.9 billion made in connection with the share buyback programme. Taking account of exchange-rate effects, cash and cash equivalents decreased by \u20ac1.7 billion since 31 December 2022. Total liquidity, which also includes marketable debt securities and similar investments, decreased by \u20ac1.9 billion to \u20ac22.8 billion.",

The decrease is mainly a result of discontinuing the business activities in Russia and the disposal of the contingent liabilities upon completion of the transaction.\n\nIn the context of its ordinary business activities, the Group has also entered into other financial obligations in addition to the liabilities shown in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position at 31 December 2023. These financial obligations result from contractual commitments to acquire intangible assets; property, plant and equipment; equipment on operating leases and irrevocable loan commitments.\n\nDetailed information on contingent liabilities and other financial obligations is provided in Note 31 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Refinancing\n\nThe funds raised by the Mercedes-Benz Group in the year 2023 primarily served to refinance the leasing and sales-financing business. For that purpose, the Mercedes-Benz Group made use of a broad spectrum of various financing instruments in various currencies and markets. They include bank loans, commercial paper in the money market, bonds, promissory-note loans and the securitization of receivables in the financial services business (asset-backed securities).\n\nVarious issuance programmes are available for raising longer-term funds in the capital market. They include the Euro Medium Term Note programme (EMTN) with a total volume of \u20ac70 billion, under which Mercedes-Benz Group AG and several subsidiaries can issue bonds in various currencies. Other local capital-market programmes exist, which are significantly smaller than the EMTN programme. Capital-market programmes allow flexible, repeated access to the capital markets.\n\nThe situation in the bond markets in the reporting year was significantly influenced by factors such as inflation and the volatility of interest rates as well as decisions by central bank.\n\nance\n\nKonzernabschluss\n\nWeitere Informationen\n\nIn the reporting period, the Group covered its refinancing requirements through the issuance of bonds and other means.

Current liabilities accounted for 31% of the balance sheet total, which is below the prior-year level of 34%.\n\n## Balance sheet structure Mercedes-Benz Group\n\nIn billions of euros\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nance\n\nKonzernabschluss\n\nWeitere Informationen\n\nBefore eliminations between segments, Mercedes-Benz Mobility accounted for \u20ac145.1 billion (2022: \u20ac142.5 billion) of the balance sheet total. During the reporting year, all intra-Group eliminations between the industrial business and Mercedes-Benz Mobility regarding the balance sheet were allocated to the industrial business. The reported size of the industrial business is determined by generally subtracting the unconsolidated balance sheet total of Mercedes-Benz Mobility from the consolidated balance sheet total of the Group. Consequently, intra-Group matters relating to the relationship between the industrial business and Mercedes-Benz Mobility are generally allocated to Mercedes-Benz Mobility and included in its balance sheet. This method of presentation reduces the balance sheet total of the industrial business. At the same time, this means that the share of Mercedes-Benz Mobility's balance sheet total in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position is shown as being higher than would be the case if Mercedes-Benz Mobility were presented on a consolidated basis.\n\n## Assets\n\nThe intangible assets of \u20ac17.6 billion (2022: \u20ac15.9 billion) particularly include \u20ac15.1 billion of capitalized development costs (2022: \u20ac13.5 billion). Of the development costs, a share of \u20ac14.0 billion (2022: \u20ac12.6 billion) was attributable to the Mercedes-Benz Cars segment and \u20ac1.1 billion (2022: \u20ac0.8 billion) to the Mercedes-Benz Vans segment. Development costs capitalized in the reporting year amounted to \u20ac3.8 billion (2022: \u20ac2.9 billion) and represent 38% (2022: 34%) of the Group's total research and development expenditure. The increase in capitalized development costs is mainly attributable to development work for the new platform generations geared towards electric mobility.\n\nProperty, plant and equipment decreased to \u20ac26.1 billion (2022: \u20ac27.3 billion). In addition to negative exchange-rate effects, the deconsolidation of the Russian companies in 2023 and the reclassification of property, plant and equipment to assets held for sale in connection with the planned divestment of sales companies in European countries other than Germany had a negative effect on the balance sheet total.",

        "page_content": "Equipment on operating leases and receivables from financial services rose to a total of \u20ac129.9 billion (2022: \u20ac127.1 billion) due to the increase in sales financing, mainly in North America. The increase adjusted for currency translation effects was \u20ac5.8 billion. At 49%, the leasing and sales-financing business as a proportion of total assets was at prior year level.\n\nEquity-method investments decreased to \u20ac13.1 billion (2022: \u20ac13.5 billion). Investments accounted for using the equity method comprise in particular the carrying amounts of our investments in Daimler Truck Holding AG and Beijing Benz Automotive Co., Ltd.\n\nInventories increased from \u20ac25.6 billion to \u20ac27.3 billion. As a result the share of total assets remains at the prior year level of 10%. The increase relates in particular to finished goods, spare parts and products held for resale at \u20ac2.2 billion as a result of the introduction of the direct sales model in additional markets and model year-related production ramp-ups. Furthermore, the finished goods include higher-value vehicles on average.\n\nAt \u20ac7.3 billion, trade receivables were lower than the prior-year-figure of \u20ac8.1 billion.\n\nance\n\nKonzernabschluss\n\nWeitere Informationen\n\nCompared to 31 December 2022, cash and cash equivalents decreased by \u20ac1.7 billion to \u20ac16.0 billion.\n\nMarketable debt securities and similar investments decreased compared with 31 December 2022 from \u20ac7.1 billion to \u20ac6.9 billion as part of the liquidity management. Those assets include the debt instruments that are allocated to liquidity, most of which are traded in active markets. They generally have an external rating of A or better.\n\nOther financial assets of \u20ac7.9 billion were at the prior-year level. They consist primarily of derivative financial instruments, equity and debt instruments, shares in non-consolidated subsidiaries, and loans and other receivables from third parties.\n\nThe other assets of \u20ac10.2 billion (2022: \u20ac9.9 billion) particularly include deferred taxes and tax refund claims.\n\nIn connection with the planned disposal of sales companies in other European countries, the Group is showing assets held for sale of \u20ac0.8 billion and liabilities held for sale of \u20ac0.2 billion as of 31 December 2023.\n\n## Equity and liabilities\n\nCompared to 31 December 2022, the Group's equity increased from \u20ac86.5 billion to \u20ac92.8 billion, mainly as a result of the positive earnings development. Additionally gains of \u20ac0.5 billion are recognized directly in equity from the measurement of derivative financial instruments after tax. An opposing effect arose from the dividend of \u20ac5.6 billion paid to the shareholders of Mercedes-Benz Group AG and the aquisition of treasury shares of \u20ac2.3 billion as part of the share buyback programme. Equity attributable to the shareholders of Mercedes-Benz Group AG increased accordingly to \u20ac91.8 billion (2022: \u20ac85.4 billion).\n\nWhereas the balance sheet total remained at the prior-year level, equity increased by 7% compared with the previous year. The Group's equity ratio of 35.3% was accordingly above the level at the end of 2022 (31.1%); the equity ratio for the industrial business was 67.6% (2022: 57.4%). It is necessary to take into account the fact that the equity ratios at the end of 2022 and 2023 have been adjusted for the paid and proposed dividend payments respectively.",

At 6%, they were also below the prior-year level of 7% of the balance sheet total. The decrease is mainly due to lower provisions for liability and litigation risks and regulatory proceedings.\n\nFinancing liabilities of \u20ac108.6 billion were below the \u20ac111.8 billion of the previous year. The decrease was due to the lower net refinancing as a result of the positive cash flow situation. The financing liabilities break down to 51% bonds, 23% liabilities to financial institutions, 14% liabilities from ABS transactions and 5% deposits in the direct banking business. The decrease in deposits from the direct banking business is related to the planned discontinuation of the retail deposit business by the end of 2024. The financing liabilities available on 31 December 2023 relate primarily to the refinancing requirements of the leasing and sales-financing business.\n\nTrade payables increased compared to 31 December 2022 from \u20ac12.2 billion to \u20ac12.8 billion.\n\nance\n\nKonzernabschluss\n\nWeitere Informationen\n\nOther financial liabilities amounted to \u20ac7.1 billion (2022: \u20ac7.9 billion). They mainly comprise liabilities from residual-value guarantees, from payroll accounting, from derivative financial instruments, deposits received, and liabilities from accrued interest on financing liabilities. The decrease in other financial liabilities is mainly attributable to lower liabilities from derivative financial instruments, the carrying amount of which declined due to interest and exchange-rate developments.\n\nThe contract and refund liabilities of \u20ac10.4 billion were below the \u20ac10.6 billion of the previous year. They include in particular deferred revenue from service and maintenance contracts and extended warranties, as well as obligations from sales transactions that are within the scope of IFRS 15.\n\nOther liabilities of \u20ac14.6 billion (2022: \u20ac13.9 billion) primarily include deferred taxes, tax liabilities and prepaid expenses. The increase was primarily attributable to higher deferred tax liabilities.\n\nFurther information on the assets presented in the statement of financial position and on the Group's equity and liabilities is provided in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position, the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity, and the related notes in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.",

In addition to reporting on the MercedesBenz Group, the development of Mercedes-Benz Group AG in the year 2023 is also described in this section.\n\nMercedes-Benz Group AG is closely linked with Mercedes-Benz AG and functions as an operating business entity that defines the Group's strategy. It also makes strategic decisions for business operations and, as the Group's parent company, ensures the effectiveness of organizational, legal and compliance-related functions throughout the Group.\n\nThe Annual Financial Statements of Mercedes-Benz Group AG are compiled in accordance with the provisions of the German Commercial Code (HGB) and the provisions of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG). The Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), as adopted by the European Union (EU). This results in some differences with regard to recognition and measurement methods, primarily in connection with provisions, financial instruments, the leasing business and deferred taxes.\n\nThe financial statements of Mercedes-Benz Group AG, for which KPMG AG Wirtschaftspr\u00fcfungsgesellschaft has issued an unqualified audit opinion, are transmitted electronically to the body responsible for managing the company register so that the statements can be entered into the company register. The financial statements can be viewed on the website of the company register as well as on the Mercedes-Benz Group website at w group.mercedes-benz.com/investors/reportsnews/annual-reports/2023.\n\nThe economic situation of Mercedes-Benz Group AG mainly depends on the development of its subsidiaries. Mercedes-Benz Group AG participates in the operating profits and losses of its subsidiaries through dividend distributions and profit-and-loss transfers. Its economic situation therefore corresponds with that of the Mercedes-Benz Group, which is described in the chapter Overall Assessment of the Financial Year.\n\nNet profit or loss is the key performance indicator for Mercedes-Benz Group AG.\n\n## Profitability\n\nNet profit amounted to \u20ac12.1 billion, which was significantly higher than the figure of \u20ac8.9 billion recorded in the previous year and corresponds to the expected range of the previous year's Outlook chapter. The earnings of Mercedes-Benz Group AG in the year under review were particularly affected by a higher level of financial income.\n\nMercedes-Benz Group AG generated revenue of \u20ac1.4 billion, primarily from the provision of services to companies of the Group (2022: \u20ac1.4 billion).\n\nCost of sales amounted to \u20ac1.4 billion (2022: \u20ac1.4 billion) and primarily comprises expenses incurred for the services provided to companies of the Group.\n\nGeneral administrative expenses amounted to \u20ac0.8 billion (2022: \u20ac0.8 billion).",

Other operating income from the previous year included income from the sale of approximately 5% of the shares of Daimler Truck Holding AG to MercedesBenz AG and their subsequent transfer to the Mercedes-Benz Pension Trust e. V.\n\nFinancial income increased by \u20ac3.8 billion to \u20ac15.6 billion. The increase in the financial income with respect to the previous year is primarily due to higher income from investments in subsidiaries and associated companies. This was the result in particular of higher profit transfers from subsidiaries, lower impairments of subsidiaries and investments and higher income from associated companies. Moreover, the rise in interest rates led to an increase in financial income.\n\nThe income tax expense amounted to \u20ac2.8 billion (2022: \u20ac2.5 billion). The rise despite a decrease in taxable operating profit within the tax group is mainly explicable by the last use of tax-loss carryforwards in 2022.\n\n## Condensed statement of income of\n\n## Mercedes-Benz Group AG\n\n|                      | 2023   | 2022   |\n|----------------------|--------|--------|\n| In millions of euros |        |        |\n\n| Revenue                             | 1,415   | 1,422   |\n|-------------------------------------|---------|---------|\n| Cost of sales                       | -1,400  | -1,407  |\n| General administrative expenses     | -779    | -752    |\n| Other operating income              | 20      | 293     |\n| Operating profit/loss               | -744    | -444    |\n| Financial income                    | 15,630  | 11,785  |\n| Income taxes                        | -2,788  | -2,464  |\n| Net profit                          | 12,098  | 8,877   |\n| Transfer to other retained earnings | -6,049  | -3,314  |\n| Distributable profit                | 6,049   | 5,563   |\n\n## Financial position\n\nTotal assets of \u20ac80.4 billion were below the level of the previous year (2022: \u20ac84.2 billion).\n\nNon-current assets increased by \u20ac0.6 billion to \u20ac40.6 billion in the course of the year. This was due to the increase of \u20ac0.6 billion in financial assets.\n\nReceivables, securities and other assets decreased compared with 31 December 2022 by \u20ac3.7 billion to \u20ac32.9 billion. This is the result of the decrease in receivables from subsidiaries of \u20ac2.7 billion, which in turn was caused by lower intra-Group financial receivables. In addition, the other assets decreased by \u20ac0.8 billion, in particular due to the maturity of fixed-term deposits.",

This increase was a result of the net profit amounting to \u20ac12.1 billion, of which \u20ac6.0 billion was transferred to retained earnings pursuant to Section 58 Subsection 2 of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG). Equity, in contrast, decreased due to the dividend payment of \u20ac5.6 billion to the shareholders of Mercedes-Benz Group AG and the ongoing share buyback programme. The equity ratio as of 31 December 2023 was 51.8% (31 December 2022: 43.9%). MercedesBenz Group AG held treasury shares of \u20ac1.9 billion as of 31 December 2023.

This was mainly due to lower provisions for taxes and the decrease in provisions for contingent losses resulting from derivative financial instruments.\n\nLiabilities decreased by \u20ac8.0 billion to \u20ac36.2 billion. This change is primarily the result of the decrease in liabilities to subsidiaries of \u20ac7.2 billion, which in turn was caused by lower intra-Group financial liabilities.

The same applies to capital increases and capital repayments from subsidiaries being presented in Cash Flow from investing activities. An offsetting recognition of cash pooling procedures takes place in Cash Flow from financing activities.\n\nCash and cash equivalents decreased by \u20ac7.5 billion to \u20ac6.6 billion. The decrease in cash and cash equivalents of \u20ac0.9 billion was influenced by the following developments:\n\nCash flow from operating activities resulted in a net cash outflow of \u20ac0.7 billion in the reporting year (2022: \u20ac1.9 billion). The cash outflow primarily resulted from income tax payments, which increased by \u20ac0.9 billion compared to the previous year. The lower cash outflow relative to the preceding year can mainly be attributed to the maturity of short-term time deposits and higher distributions to subsidiaries and associated companies.",

On the one hand, the change was due to lower net cash inflows from the acquisition and disposal of securities within the context of liquidity management (2023: \u20ac0.1 billion; 2022: \u20ac1.1 billion). On the other, capital repayments from subsidiaries resulted in higher cash inflows in the previous year.\n\nCash flow from financing activities resulted in a cash outflow of \u20ac0.1 billion in the reporting period (2022: \u20ac1.3 billion). The decreasing cash outflow compared to the previous year was mainly due to the lower repayment of external financing liabilities. However, a lower cash inflow compared to the previous year resulted from the financing provided to subsidiaries in connection with central financial and liquidity management. Alongside this, the cash outflows increased as a result of the share buyback transactions in the reporting year as well as the dividend payment to shareholders of Mercedes-Benz Group AG.\n\n## Outlook\n\nThe financial position, cash flows and profitability of Mercedes-Benz Group AG depend on the business developments and the performance of its operating subsidiaries, in whose development it participates through profit-and-loss transfer agreements and dividend distributions.\n\nDue to the interrelations between Mercedes-Benz Group AG and the companies of the Group, the statements in the Outlook chapter therefore reflect our expectations for the parent company as well.\n\nFor the year 2024, Mercedes-Benz Group AG expects to post a significantly higher net profit than for the year 2023, primarily as a result of significantly improved financial income to be brought about by higher profit transfers from major subsidiaries.\n\n## Risks and opportunities\n\nThe business development of Mercedes-Benz Group AG mainly depends on the development of its worldwide subsidiaries and is therefore - through the profit and loss contributions from subsidiaries and associated companies - fundamentally subject to the same risks and opportunities as is the business development of the Group.\n\nMercedes-Benz Group AG generally participates in the risks of its subsidiaries and associated companies in line with the percentage of its respective equity interest. The risks and opportunities are described in the Risk and Opportunity Report.\n\nRisks may additionally arise from relations with subsidiaries and associated companies in connection with statutory or contractual liability obligations (in particular with regard to financing), from impairments of financial assets and from financial receivables from subsidiaries and associated companies.\n\nFurthermore, pursuant to Section 133 Subsections 1 and 3 of the German Transformation Act (UmwG), MercedesBenz Group AG is jointly and severally liable for liabilities of \u20ac4.7 billion that were transferred to MercedesBenz AG and Daimler Truck AG in 2019. According to the current appraisal, due to the assessment of the credit ratings of Mercedes-Benz AG and Daimler Truck AG, an actual cash outflow for Mercedes-Benz Group AG is considered to be unlikely.",

The Mercedes-Benz Group publishes the Non-Financial Declaration in accordance with the provisions of Sections 315b, 315c in connection with Sections 289b-289e of the German Commercial Code (HGB). The Non-Financial Declaration contains the main information on the aspects of environmental, employee and social issues, combating corruption and bribery, and respect for human rights. The information provided in this declaration is presented in conformity with the GRI Standards of the Global Reporting Initiative, insofar as this complies with applicable law. Some aspects are presented in accordance with internal guidelines and definitions. Insofar as not otherwise specified, all information concerning the MercedesBenz Group refers to the Consolidated Group in the context of the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz Group integrates the Non-Financial Declaration into the Combined Management Report of this Annual Report. Each year, it examines whether and how the integration of financial and non-financial key figures should be further developed. For the year under review, it was decided to continue to publish more in-depth information about sustainability at the Mercedes-Benz Group in a separate Sustainability Report for the previous reporting year. It will be available on the Group's website on the Internet (additional information w group.mercedes-benz.com/sustainability). Further information on the business model of the Mercedes-Benz Group can be found in the chapter Corporate Profile.\n\n## Sustainability as a driver of change\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz Group aims to create value that is sustainable - economically, environmentally and socially. This is one of the core principles of the Group. It applies not only to the Group's own products and production sites but also to its entire upstream and downstream value chain. The Mercedes-Benz Group translates this approach into its sustainable business strategy and thus firmly embeds its sustainability issues into its daily business. Among other things, the goal is to fulfil the demands and expectations of the stakeholders - i.e. customers, investors, employees, business partners, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and society as a whole.\n\nOne of the most important goals at the Mercedes-Benz Group is decarbonization, which the Group has made a firm component of its sustainable business strategy. The Group's strategy includes the Ambition 2039 target, which aims to make the entire Mercedes-Benz new vehicle fleet net carbon-neutral 1 across all stages of the value chain by 2039. Mercedes-Benz Cars and Mercedes-Benz Vans are creating the necessary conditions to become all-electric. The pace of transformation",

Mercedes-Benz Cars and Mercedes-Benz Vans are getting ready to be able to meet the various customer requirements, be it an all-electric drivetrain or an combustion engine - into the 2030s if necessary.\n\n## Areas of action and the foundations of sustainability\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz Group acts in line with the sustainable business strategy adopted by the Board of Management of Mercedes-Benz Group AG in 2019 with the agreement of the Supervisory Board. Sustainability issues are an integral part of the business strategy.\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz Group's sustainable business strategy takes into account the regulatory requirements that are relevant to its business operations, as well as recognized international frameworks, the expectations of external and internal stakeholders, and global trends. The Mercedes-Benz Group also conducts materiality assessments on a regular basis in order to identify strategic areas of action. Here the Mercedes-Benz Group bases its activities on the United Nation's (UN) 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) - especially SDGs 8 and 9 and 11 to 13 - among other factors, and in the process concentrates on the areas where it can create value added. It discusses the material areas of action with the involvement of relevant stakeholder groups. During the year under review, the Group confirmed the six strategic areas of action shown below and, where necessary, further specified the strategic ambitions associated with these areas of action.\n\n- -Climate Change mitigation and air quality : Plans call for the Mercedes-Benz new vehicle fleet to be net carbon-neutral across the entire value chain by 2039 and to no longer have any impact on NO 2 levels in urban areas by 2025.\n- -Resource conservation: The Mercedes-Benz Group wants to decouple resource consumption from business volume growth.\n- -More sustainable urban mobility: The MercedesBenz Group wants to contribute to the improvement of the quality of life in cities through mobility and transport solutions.\n- -Traffic safety: The Mercedes-Benz Group is working to make its vision of accident-free driving a reality as it develops automated driving systems while also taking social and ethical issues into account.\n- -Data responsibility: Customer trust and the responsible handling of customer data are the basis for sustainable digital products and services.\n- -Human rights: The Mercedes-Benz Group assumes responsibility and is committed to safeguarding human rights along its own automotive value chain.\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz Group has defined three principles, or enablers, that are crucial for achieving success in the six areas of action: integrity, people and partnerships.\n\n## Materiality assessment\n\nThe Group conducted a comprehensive materiality assessment in 2021 in order to determine which sustainability topics are particularly relevant for the Mercedes-Benz Group and its stakeholders. The analysis was completed in summer 2022 and, following a review of the areas of action, is applicable for the year 2023\n\nThis materiality assessment addressed the six strategic areas of action as well as further potentially relevant sustainability topics and trends. A total of 17 topics were evaluated, and these were further divided into sub-topics.\n\nThe analysis consists of several components: a desk analysis, an international online survey as well as interviews with internal and external experts, an assessment of the impact of the Mercedes-Benz Group's business activities on the environment and society (inside-out) as well as an analysis of the external influences on the Mercedes-Benz Group's business activities (outside-in-dimension).\n\nIn addition, the sustainability issues resulting from the analysis were reviewed with regard to their impact on financial position, profitability and business development. On this basis, the topics for the Non-financial Declaration were defined. For this reason, not all strategic areas of action are reflected in this Non-financial Declaration.",

This process shall be supported by clear lines of responsibility in the management and organizational structures used at all of the divisions.\n\nAt the end of July 2023, the Supervisory Board decided to establish at the Board of Management level a cross-divisional steering and coordination function for sustainability management throughout the Group. Renata Jungo Br\u00fcngger then took over this function of Sustainability Coordinator on 1 August 2023. Her executive division was renamed Integrity, Governance & Sustainability (previously Integrity and Legal).\n\nThe previous central management body for sustainability - the Group Sustainability Board (GSB) - was replaced by the Group Sustainability Committee (GSC) during the year under review. This new body meets on a quarterly basis and is chaired by Renata Jungo Br\u00fcngger in her capacity as Sustainability Coordinator. The committee, which is made up of representatives from top management, is responsible for the holistic management of ESG topics across all functions, divisions and regions in line with goals and targets, KPIs and areas of responsibility. The members of the GSC are also responsible for addressing sustainability topics in the functions they manage.\n\n- 1   Further information on sales of plug-in hybrids and all-electric vehicles can be found in the chapter Environmental Issues, Electrified Product Range\n\nIn addition, Sustainability Coordination Meetings (SCMs) are held in which the GSC discusses sustainability topics and issues with representatives from all relevant divisions and specialist units. SCMs are conducted regularly every 14 days and are chaired by the Sustainability Competence Office (SCO). The SCO itself provides advice to the specialist units and helps them complete the tasks assigned to them by the Board of Management or the GSC. The SCO also monitors the progress made in the six areas of action and the three enablers defined in the sustainable business strategy. The results of these analyses during the year are reported to the GSC and the Board of Management of MercedesBenz Group AG in the form of detailed scorecards at least twice a year.\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz Group also uses the ten principles of the UN Global Compact (UNGC) as a fundamental guide for its business activities. As a founding member, it is strongly committed to the UN Global Compact.\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz Group's internal principles and policies are founded on this international frame of reference and other international principles, including the Core Labour Standards of the International Labour Organization (ILO), the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.\n\nRemuneration for the Board of Management and executives was adjusted in 2023. The changes were made in order to reduce the complexity of the remuneration system, create transparency and ensure an integrated approach with regard to the incentives used to promote sustainable business operations at the Group. In addition to financial targets, the variable remuneration for members of the Board of Management and Level 1-3 executives, as well as for certain Level 4 managers, contains short-term transformation targets relating to CO 2 emissions, safety innovations and ESG stakeholder management. In 2023, the variable components also included long-term sustainability targets relating to the share of unit sales accounted for by plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) and all-electric vehicles (BEVs) 1 , the inspection of high-risk production materials and measures for ensuring diversity and inclusion. The variable remuneration components also continue to include non-financial targets relating to customers, employees and integrity. (Further information w group.mercedesbenz.com/remuneration-bom)",

In identifying these risks and opportunities, the Mercedes-Benz Group is guided by the topics identified by the materiality assessment and thus includes the areas of action of the sustainable business strategy, for which concrete goals have been assigned. These risks and opportunities are understood to be conditions, events or developments involving ESG factors, the occurrence of which may have an actual or potential impact on the Mercedes-Benz Group's profitability, liquidity, capital resources, financial position and reputation. This further includes any risks and opportunities whose occurrence may have a positive or negative impact on the economy, the environment or society.\n\nESG topics - as they relate to the environment include, among other things, the effects of climate conditions and changes. Risks can arise for the Group's transformation process as a result of changed political conditions, technological developments and changing markets. Labour law standards, occupational and product safety, product liability and suppliers' compliance with labour law standards are examples of circumstances categorized as social issues that can harbour risks. The area of governance is concerned with matters\n\nsuch as stipulations arising from competition law and measures to prevent corruption, for example, which can lead to risks.\n\nESG-related risks and opportunities associated with the Mercedes-Benz Group's own business activities, business relationships and products and services, and which are very likely to have a serious negative impact on the non-financial aspects in accordance with Sections 315c and 289c of the German Commercial Code (HGB), are not currently apparent. Risks and opportunities in connection with the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) are environment factors and are thus also identified and assessed as part of the risk management process. (Further information w group.mercedes-benz. com/investors/share/esg)\n\n## Sustainable investment\n\nThe implementation of the Mercedes-Benz Group's sustainable business strategy requires massive amounts of investment. For this reason, one of the Group's goals is to ensure that its securities are viewed even more strongly by the capital market as a sustainable investment. To this end, the Mercedes-Benz Group maintains a continuous dialogue with players on the capital market as representatives of investors in equity and debt. Various platforms are used here. For example, the second digital ESG Conference was one of the formats used by the Mercedes-Benz Group in the 2023 reporting year to provide information to investors and\n\nanalysts on the latest developments relating to its sustainable business strategy.\n\nWith regard to ESG communication, the Investor Relations & Treasury unit at Mercedes-Benz Group AG works closely together with the company's in-house sustainability departments and is also integrated into the relevant committees (e.g. the GSC). This is how the company is responding to the fact that sustainable investment has become a central investment strategy - in particular for institutional investors, who set especially high standards of transparency for external reporting according to ESG criteria.\n\nDuring the year under review, the Group updated its Green Finance Framework from 2020 in order to position the Mercedes-Benz Group even more effectively as a company worthy of sustainable investment and to enable it to utilize ESG-based capital for its business development. This framework makes it possible for the Group to finance investment targeted at the development, production and customer financing of all-electric vehicles through bonds and loans, for example. It was on this basis that the Mercedes-Benz Group once again issued bonds with terms of three and eight years in May 2023.",

The updated framework has also received certification with the highest rating - 'Dark Green' - from the Centre for International Climate and Environmental Research (CICERO), which also issued an 'Excellent' rating for the governance structure defined in the framework.\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz Group operates as an investor itself when it invests the company's pension assets. ESG criteria are also playing an increasingly important role in this area.\n\nFor German pension assets, the following objectives have been defined for the consideration of ESG criteria: creation of transparency in dealing with sustainability aspects, utilization of opportunities from sustainable developments and the appropriate consideration of sustainability risks. For the majority of German pension assets the investments are made by asset managers to whom the Group issues individual mandates.\n\nIn coordination with the Investment Committees, the Mercedes-Benz Group pays, as part of its sustainability concept, increased attention to the consideration and transparency of sustainability aspects in the investment process. When the company makes sustainable investments, it also takes the associated risk and return aspects into account. For liquid asset classes, the\n\nMercedes-Benz Group only works with investment managers who have signed the UN Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI). The use of a negative list is intended to exclude investing in companies and countries that do not fulfil the Group's core requirements. By implementing ESG-themed investments, the MercedesBenz Group utilizes the opportunities offered by sustainable developments. Furthermore, the MercedesBenz Group focuses on gradually integrating sustainability aspects - via benchmarks or sustainability performance indicators, for example - into its mandates. To this end, the Group included sustainability targets in some of its mandates with external asset managers in 2023 and also firmly incorporated these goals and targets into its investment guidelines. Taking into account the available data coverage, the Group was thus able to achieve a lower carbon footprint for its asset classes equities and corporate bonds of the German pension assets compared to the aggregated benchmark. Whereas the aggregated benchmark is determined by the indices awarded to the asset managers, the carbon footprint is calculated based on externally bought ESG data. In addition, the Mercedes-Benz Group also established an internal reporting system for various sustainability metrics for its German pension assets.\n\nThe measures we have implemented as part of our sustainability concept are regularly assessed and adapted to current developments. Mercedes-Benz Pensionsfonds AG takes into account adverse effects on sustainability factors within the framework of the Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation. For investing foreign\n\npension assets, country-specific requirements regarding consideration of ESG criteria apply.\n\n## Tax obligation\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz Group views itself as a responsible company that endeavours to meet all of its global tax obligations and use public funding responsibly. In this way, the Group can also fulfil its social and ethical responsibilities.\n\nThe Group's tax strategy operates according to the following principles in particular:\n\n- -   By qualified and experienced experts and, if possible, efficient and reliable processes, systems, methods and controls the Mercedes-Benz Group wants to ensure that the tax obligations by the Group companies are met and integrity standards are maintained.\n- -   In line with the principle of being a good corporate tax citizen (i.e. fulfilling its responsibility as a taxpayer), the Mercedes-Benz Group conducts legal, proactive and non-aggressive tax planning activities on the basis of operational considerations ('tax follows business'). The Mercedes-Benz Group also strives to work even more cooperatively, transparently and constructively with the tax authorities. In this process, it maintains its legal standpoints and defends its interests wherever it believes such actions are appropriate and legitimate.",

The tax strategy is regularly reviewed for appropriate adjustments.\n\nThe tax policies define the responsibilities, tasks and obligations of those individuals in the Group who deal with tax issues and also contain specific provisions for ensuring that legal requirements are met. Management is kept informed about relevant tax issues by means of monthly reports and regular communications, as well as when required. Moreover, it is involved in compliance processes:\n\n- -   Regular communication between CFO and Head of Taxes\n- -   Regular information to the Supervisory Board on risks and opportunities as well as current regulatory issues\n\nThe Code of Conduct stipulates that all intentional violations of external and/or internal tax guidelines must be reported and investigated. The same applies to any failure to make corrections to procedures performed in an erroneous manner, as outlined in our internally valid Treatment of Violations Policy. Further information can be found in the Integrity and Compliance chapter.\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz Group has established a Tax Compliance Management System (Tax CMS) in order to ensure effective tax compliance throughout the Group. The Tax CMS is a separate sub-unit of the general intraGroup Compliance Management System. The Tax CMS also operates an active tax-risk management system that is consistently applied throughout the Group in order to monitor and check whether tax obligations are being fulfilled, and also to support those responsible for ensuring such fulfilment. Another goal here is to identify and reduce tax risks at the Group, and thus the associated personal risks that may be faced by the employees active in this area. The system includes numerous measures - for example, continuous monitoring of tax risks and the incorporation of tax risk issues into the internal control system and the Groupwide risk management process in line with the company's risk management policy. Based on the Code of Conduct the Mercedes-Benz Group did not become aware of any material violations during the reporting year.\n\n## Sustainability in the supply chain\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz Group is committed to the responsible procurement of production materials, non-production materials and services.\n\nThe Group has incorporated the guidelines for sustainable supply chain management into the Responsible Sourcing Standards (RSS). These are contractually stipulated with direct suppliers and are applied worldwide. The goal here is to prevent, minimize or, if possible, put\n\na stop to any negative effects on human rights worldwide. The RSS define the minimum requirements for suppliers. They are already used as a basis for the tendering process for suppliers of production materials. The RSS require direct suppliers to communicate the RSS provisions to their own employees and to their direct suppliers, and ensure that the RSS are complied with in their business processes and in the areas in which they exert an influence. Suppliers are to conserve natural resources and avoid environmental damage, repair any damage that does occur, and compensate for such damage that cannot be avoided or repaired.\n\n## Measures in the supply chain\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz Group uses a variety of measures and concepts to ensure the fulfilment of its due diligence obligations in the supply chain. This includes training, preventive and corrective measures, risk analyses, documentation for tracking and reporting purposes and effectiveness checks. The Mercedes-Benz Group uses these tools in order to increase the transparency of the supply chain and ensures that the internationally recognized human rights are upheld by business partners as well, and that other social standards and environmental requirements are met. The procurement units for production materials, non-production materials and services play a key role here. Further information in the chapters Social Compliance and Environmental Issues.",

It is convinced of the goals of the agreement and is working to implement them in all of its divisions. About one fifth of all greenhouse gas emissions in Europe are produced as a result of the transport of people and goods on streets and roads. The Mercedes-Benz Group is taking deliberate measures to counteract this trend and has made climate protection a core element of its business strategy. The Group's ambition is to make the entire Mercedes-Benz new vehicle fleet net carbon-neutral 1 across all stages of the value chain by 2039.\n\nIn order to achieve this goal, the Mercedes-Benz Group is transforming the products and services that are at the heart of its business activities. The company also takes into account climate protection in all of the life cycle phases of its automobiles - from the supply chain and its own manufacturing operations to the use and disposal of the vehicles.\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz Group believes that the complete electrification of its product range is the most important lever of making its entire new vehicle fleet net carbon-neutral across all stages of the value chain by 2039. The Mercedes-Benz Group is continuing to seek to shape the transformation to an all-electric and software-driven future. The Mercedes-Benz Group remains focused and tactically flexible in terms of its strategy. Accordingly, the Mercedes-Benz Group has adjusted some of its electrification targets and target corridors based on market conditions and customer requirements.\n\nMercedes-Benz Cars and Mercedes-Benz Vans are taking the necessary steps to go all-electric. The pace of transformation is determined by market conditions and customers. Mercedes-Benz Cars and Mercedes-Benz Vans plan to be in a position to cater to different customer needs, whether it's an all-electric drivetrain or a combustion engine, until well into the 2030s. Climate protection is a key cornerstone of the Mercedes-Benz Group's sustainable business strategy. As early as November 2021, the Mercedes-Benz Group underscored its commitment to this transformation during the COP26 UN Climate Change Conference.\n\n| Target                                                                                                                      | Target horizon                     |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|\n| Climate protection                                                                                                          |                                    |\n| A fleet of new Mercedes-Benz vehicles that is net  carbon-neutral along all stages of the value chain                       | 2039                               |\n| Climate protection for vehicles                                                                                             |                                    |\n| Reduction of the CO 2  emissions per car in the new  vehicle fleet up to 50% along all stages of the value  chain 1,2       | By the end   of the decade         |\n| Increase the proportion of electrified 3  vehicles in the  fleet of new vehicles at Mercedes-Benz Cars to as  high as 50% 1 | In the second half   of the decade |\n| Electrify all new vehicle architectures 1,3                                                                                 | In the second half   of the decade |\n| Offer an electrified 3  variant for every model from  Mercedes-Benz Cars 1                                                  | In the second half   of the decade |\n| Offer an electrified 4  alternative for every model from  Mercedes-Benz Vans                                                | Target achieved                    |\n| Increase the proportion of electrified 4  vehicles in the  fleet of new vehicles at Mercedes-Benz Vans to more  than 50% 1  | By the end of   the decade         |\n\n- 1 The pace of transformation is determined by market conditions and customers.\n- 2   Compared to 2020 (value chain stages: procured goods, production, logistics, fuel and energy generation, driving operation, disassembly and treatment processes)\n- 3   Plug-in hybrids and all-electric vehicles\n- 4  All-electric vehicles",

        "page_content": "## Responsibilities\n\nThe Board of Management of the Mercedes-Benz Group is responsible for setting strategic goals, including targets for reducing the CO 2 emissions, and for monitoring the progress made in achieving these goals. The Product Steering Board (PSB) at Mercedes-Benz Cars is responsible for the car fleet. In particular, this body monitors the development of CO 2 emissions of the Mercedes-Benz car fleet by comparing them with the legally defined targets in markets subject to CO 2 -emission regulations. The PSB is assigned to the Committee for Model Policy and Product Planning (AMP).\n\nThe Division and Product Strategy unit at MercedesBenz Vans ensures compliance with the CO 2 fleet emission limits and reports on this regularly to the Van Executive Committee.\n\nThe Committee for Model Policy and Product Planning and the Van Executive Committee regularly report to the Board of Management of Mercedes-Benz Group AG about the development of CO 2 emissions. The Board of Management then decides which measures need to be implemented. On the market side of the equation, price and volume control measures can also affect our ability to achieve our CO 2 targets.\n\n## Electrified product range\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz Group's goal is to further expand its range of electric vehicles. The Group's commitment to research and development is correspondingly strong.\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz Group has been offering all-electric vehicles since 2018. During the year under review, the Group presented the Mercedes-Maybach EQS SUV, which brought the number of all-electric models in the Mercedes-Benz Cars portfolio to nine in 2023. Plug-in hybrids are also an important transitional technology on the road to an all-electric future. Customers could choose between more than 25 plug-in hybrid model variants in the reporting year.\n\nElectrified vehicles (xEV) at Mercedes-Benz Cars accounted for 20% of the Group's worldwide unit sales in the year under review. All-electric models (BEVs) accounted for 12% of the Group's worldwide unit sales in the year under review.\n\nIn the van segment as well, the Mercedes-Benz Group is convinced of the ecological and economic advantages of all-electric vehicles and has firmly anchored its claim to leadership in electric mobility in its strategy. In this way, Mercedes-Benz Vans is also setting the course for an all-electric future, and beginning in 2026 all new vans are to be developed as all-electric models exclusively. All model series have already been systematically electrified, and today body manufacturers and customers can choose an all-electric van in every segment - for both commercial and private use. The models here include the eVito, the EQV, the eSprinter, the eCitan and the EQT. (WLTP: combined energy consumption: 20.7-19.3 kWh/100 km; combined CO\u2082 emissions: 0g/km; CO 2 class: A).\n\nElectrified vehicles from Mercedes-Benz Vans accounted for 5% of the Group's worldwide unit sales in the year under review.\n\n## Development of CO 2 emissions in Europe\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz Group has defined the CO 2 emissions of its new passenger car fleet in Europe as one of its most important non-financial performance indicators. In the reporting year, the average CO 2 emissions of the Mercedes-Benz new vehicle fleet in Europe (European Union, Norway and Iceland), applying the statutory regulations, on the basis of internal data amount to 111g/km (including vans registered as passenger cars) and were thus lower than in the previous year. Taking the vehicles of the joint venture smart Automobile Co., Ltd. into account in the Mercedes-Benz CO 2 pool, the average CO 2 emissions in Europe (European Union, Norway and Island) amounted to 109 g/km according to internal calculations. This means that the CO 2 -emission figures for the Mercedes-Benz Group were significantly below the CO 2 targets in Europe in 2023. The Mercedes-Benz Group also expects that the average CO 2 emissions of the Mercedes-Benz fleet in Europe (European Union, Norway and Iceland) will be further reduced in 2024. This development will be especially favoured by the fact that the share of total car sales accounted for by all-electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles will continue to increase.

        "page_content": "In the reporting year, the average CO 2 emissions of vehicle category N1 light trucks (GVW of up to 3.5 tons) in Europe (European Union, Norway and Iceland) as measured on the basis of the legal regulations on the basis of internal data amount to 204 g/km. This means that the figures for Mercedes-Benz will be below the CO 2 target. The Mercedes-Benz Group expects that increased unit sales of all-electric vehicles will lead to a further reduction of CO 2 emissions in 2024.\n\n## Development of CO 2 emissions in the United States\n\nIn the United States, fleet values are regulated by two separate federal standards for limiting greenhouse gases and fuel consumption in vehicle fleets: the Greenhouse Gas Protocol (GHG) and the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standard. For the 2023 model year, the GHG fleet figure is 170 g CO 2 /mi for the car fleet and 259 g CO 2 /mi for the light duty truck (LDT) fleet (vans and SUVs - based on latest forecast). Due to an increase in the share of the total fleet in the United States accounted for by electrified vehicles (xEV), the Mercedes-Benz Group came in below its average fleet target of 179 g CO 2 /mi for the car fleet. The target value of 233 g CO 2 /mi for the light duty truck (LDT) fleet (vans and SUVs) could not be reached. However, the Mercedes-Benz Group was able to offset the remaining difference through the purchase of external credits.\n\nThe models of the Mercedes-Benz Sprinter are subject to the GHG regulation for Classes 2b and 3 with a gross vehicle weight (GVW) of between 3.86 tons and 6.35 tons. The CO 2 targets in these classes depend on the payload, the towing capacity and the drive type of the vehicles. In the reporting year, the CO 2 emissions of Mercedes-Benz medium duty vehicles (MDV) were 436 g CO 2 /mi, which is lower than the target value of 476 g CO 2 /mi. The Group expects its figures to also be lower than the CO 2 target values in the years ahead.\n\n## Development of CO 2 emissions in China\n\nIn China, domestic and imported cars are reported separately and according to fleet consumption values, unlike in Europe and the United States. This means the figures for the imported fleet are the relevant figures for Mercedes-Benz China (MBCL) 1 , which does not manufacture vehicles in the country. The target was 6.95 l/100 km; the figure that was actually achieved was 8.46 l/100 km taking into account off-cycle technologies (8.52 l/100 km not taking into account off-cycle technologies). MBCL plans to purchase external credits in order to close consumption gaps in the fleet's target achievement at short notice.\n\n## Climate protection in the  supply chain\n\n| Target                                              | Target horizon   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|------------------|\n| Climate protection in the supply chain              |                  |\n| All production materials procured by Mercedes-Benz  |                  |\n| Cars and Mercedes-Benz Vans are net carbon-neutral1 | 2039             |\n\n- 1 Measured on the basis of the annual procurement volume that, in turn, is based on target figures updated monthly; guaranteed by means of signatures.\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz Group implements various projects and measures in order to avoid and reduce CO 2 emissions in its supply chains for services as well as for production and non-production materials. This is why in the future the Group intends to work only with partners that share its view of sustainability with regard to the climate, the environment and human rights and has also incorporated net carbon neutrality 2 into the terms of its contracts. As early as 2020, Mercedes-Benz Cars and Mercedes-Benz Vans sent out to suppliers of production materials the ambition letter, which is a declaration of intent regarding net carbon-neutral products. Signing the ambition letter is today a key criterion for the awarding of contracts. By signing this document, supplier companies commit themselves to supply Mercedes-Benz cars and Mercedes-Benz vans only with production material that is net carbon-neutral by 2039 at the latest - and thus to the Mercedes-Benz Group's",

        "page_content": "'Ambition 2039'. As a milestone, for example, contracts were signed with two steel suppliers from Europe and America in the year under review, which provide for deliveries of CO 2 -reduced steel for current and future model series. Progress on climate protection in the supply chain is reported at regular intervals in the Group Sustainability Committee (GSC).\n\n## Resource conservation in the supply chain\n\nThe supply chain also plays an important role in efforts to conserve resources. The Mercedes-Benz Group wants to decouple resource consumption from economic growth. To achieve this goal, it is relying on the support of its suppliers. With their help, the Group wants to continuously increase the proportion of secondary and renewable materials in its vehicles.\n\nPlastics, steel and aluminium have been identified as particularly important such materials in Mercedes-Benz vehicles. We need large volumes of these materials for the production of our vehicles, and their extraction and processing also consume large amounts of energy and resources.\n\nPlastics and recyclates: throughout their entire life cycles, vehicles from the Mercedes-Benz brand are in future to be more environmentally friendly and less resource-intensive than before. The cornerstones of this approach involve the use of recyclates and lightweight\n\nmaterials, as well as recyclability. Mercedes-Benz Group requirement specifications already define a minimum proportion of recycled material for each component in new Mercedes-Benz cars. This proportion varies depending on the vehicle model and series in question. As part of its sustainable business strategy, the Mercedes-Benz Group also relies on the use of natural fibres and textiles as a means of replacing conventional plastics with renewable raw materials.\n\nSteel: The use of secondary materials such as steel scrap can reduce primary resource requirements in line with a circular economy. For example, Mercedes-Benz AG and its partner therefore ensure the recycling of scrap steel from the Mercedes-Benz Cars plant in Sindelfingen, Germany.\n\nAluminium: Mercedes-Benz Cars and Mercedes-Benz Vans already use recycled materials, including recycled aluminium, in numerous series-production vehicles. Aluminium is a light metal that can be recycled without any loss of quality, and the recycling process for aluminium uses less energy than would be required to produce new aluminium. In order to continue increasing its use of recycled materials, Mercedes-Benz AG is working with its suppliers to develop aluminium alloys with high end-of-life scrap potential - from old vehicles or packaging, for example. In addition, by amending existing supply agreements, Mercedes-Benz AG and its suppliers continued to work on the decarbonization of the aluminium supply chain for all of their production operations in Europe. At least one third of the primary aluminium that will be used for new electric models in Europe is to be produced using energy from renewable sources.\n\nIn 2020, secondary material targets were defined for Mercedes-Benz Cars and Mercedes-Benz Vans, and these were then firmly incorporated into the requirements for contract awards. In the reporting year, the Company carried out a model series-specific analysis at component level in order to realize further potential for increasing secondary materials. Project milestones and the status of projects with regard to the use of secondary materials are presented on a quarterly basis in the executive bodies for the various model series. The responsible member of the Board of Management of Mercedes-Benz Cars and the responsible executive management team member of Mercedes-Benz Vans are also provided with information on a regular basis within the framework of the activities of a committee that manages strategic sustainability matters.\n\nWith its Responsible Sourcing Standards, the MercedesBenz Group has also defined other environmental requirements in its supplier agreements. Further information can be found in the 'Sustainability in the supply chain' section.\n\nSuppliers of production materials to Mercedes-Benz Cars and Mercedes-Benz Vans are expected to operate with an environmental management system that is certified according to ISO 14001 or EMAS. Depending on the specific risks, this also applies to suppliers of non-production materials and services.\n\nMercedes-Benz Cars and Mercedes-Benz Vans are also cooperating with organizations such as CDP (formerly Carbon Disclosure Project) so that they can depict the environmental impact of their supply chains even more transparently. The suppliers have been reporting on their",

One of the most important targets is the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. The Mercedes-Benz Group's goal is to achieve carbon-neutral production at its own production plants by 2039. This is to be achieved by covering energy consumption with 100% renewable energies. In this way, the Mercedes-Benz Group intends to act in accordance with the Paris Agreement on climate change.\n\nAs it moves towards achieving this goal, CO 2 emissions are to be consistently reduced or, wherever possible, completely eliminated. In order to accomplish this, the Mercedes-Benz Group is relying on the purchase of green electricity, the expansion of renewable energy sources at its locations and the implementation of a sustainable heating supply system. The Mercedes-Benz Group plans to reduce CO 2 emissions at its own plants (Scope 1 and Scope 2) by 80% by 2030 compared to 2018. Production at all manufacturing locations operated by the Mercedes-Benz Group has been net carbon-neutral regarding Scope 1 and Scope 2 since 2022 1 . Since 2022, all CO 2 emissions (Scope 1 and Scope 2) at these production facilities that have been as yet unavoidable have been offset by means of carbon offsets\n\nfrom qualified climate protection projects1. Remaining emissions are released in particular by the combined heat and power facilities that use natural gas to produce electricity and heat.\n\nFor the procurement of green electricity, the MercedesBenz Group in Germany currently relies on a mix of solar, wind and hydroelectric power for external electricity purchases. The Mercedes-Benz Group is also taking measures to expand the use of energy from renewable sources at its locations.\n\nIn 2022, the Mercedes-Benz Group already achieved the goal of reducing CO 2 emissions at its own plants (Scope 1 and 2) by 50% by 2030 compared to 2018 (target confirmed by the Science Based Targets initiative, an initiative to set science-based climate targets) 2 . During the reporting year, Mercedes-Benz Cars and Mercedes-Benz Vans employed various measures that enabled them to reduce CO 2 emissions in production (Scope 1 and Scope 2) from 5391 thousand tons in 2022 to 5111 thousand tons in the year under review 3 , and thus by 5%1.",

That's why the goal of the Mercedes-Benz Group is to increasingly decouple its consumption of resources from the growth of its production volume.\n\nThe consumption of resources in production plays an important role in the environmental compatibility of vehicles. For this reason, the Mercedes-Benz Group is working continuously to make production more efficient and more environmentally compatible. In order to improve its environmental footprint in production\n\noperations, the Group has set reduction targets for energy, water and waste at all of its production sites worldwide.\n\nIn order to achieve its goals, the Group uses Groupwide resource management with its environmental and energy management systems to ensure that appropriate measures are developed, adapted to challenges where necessary, and monitored.\n\nIn order to ensure efficient, high-quality, and environmentally friendly manufacturing operations, the Group has established an environmental management system certified in accordance with ISO 14001 at its production sites around the world. All German manufacturing locations and the two European production sites in Kecskem\u00e9t, Hungary, and Vitoria, Spain, have also been validated in accordance with EMAS. In addition, the German production sites have had energy management systems conforming to DIN EN ISO 50001 in place since 2012, and the Group has these systems certified every three years. The Mercedes-Benz Group is currently also implementing ISO 50001 systems at a number of individual sites outside Germany, for example in Kecskem\u00e9t in Hungary, Jawor in Poland and Vitoria in Spain. In addition, during the year under review the MercedesBenz Group also moved ahead with the introduction on an international scale of energy management systems certified in accordance with ISO 50001. New management systems were implemented in Pune, India, and Sebes, Romania, for example.\n\nThe effectiveness of the management systems is monitored by external auditors as part of the certification process (ISO 14001, EMAS, ISO 50001), as well as in the environmental sector by internal environmental risk assessments (environmental due diligence process). The Group also has a standardized process in place for reviewing and assessing its consolidated production sites every five years. The results of this process are reported to the respective plant and company management so that any necessary optimizations can be carried out.\n\n## Reduction of energy consumption\n\nThe optimization of energy efficiency enables the Mercedes-Benz Group to decrease its energy consumption and conserve resources, while reducing the CO 2 emissions of its production processes.\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz Group regularly measures and assesses essential energy consumption in order to identify and take advantage of savings potential in the areas of production and infrastructure. An innovative energy management software system has been introduced at Mercedes-Benz Cars and Mercedes-Benz Vans in order to create transparency with regard to energy procurement and energy consumption.\n\nIn its effort to save energy, the Mercedes-Benz Group relies on the efficient management of energy supply and building technology systems - for example by means of needs-based management of local lighting, air volume flow regulation in ventilation and exhaust air",

Due to similar effects, energy consumption per vehicle at Mercedes-Benz Vans fell by 8% 1 compared to the previous year 2 .\n\n## Efficient water utilization\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz Group developed the 'Storm Water Protection - Pollutant Discharge Elimination' standard all the way back in 2014 so that its sites could initiate targeted water protection measures. It contains guidelines on how rainwater management at production sites, branches and workshops can prevent and reduce potential pollution from previously contaminated rainwater. In 2022, the Mercedes-Benz Group adopted a Water Policy so that it might continue to effectively contribute to the creation of a more sustainable water management system. In addition, the Group set itself the goal of no longer using drinking water in production operations at any Mercedes-Benz manufacturing locations worldwide. In order to further minimize fresh\n\nwater consumption, the Mercedes-Benz Group also intends to use hybrid cooling systems. The Group launched an initial project in this area in Sindelfingen, Germany, in June 2023 in cooperation with the municipal wastewater management and disposal company. The goal here is to employ a closed cycle to largely replace the fresh water used in production with treated municipal wastewater.\n\nFor years now, the Mercedes-Benz Group has been using its own accounting method, which focuses in particular on fresh water, to monitor and assess its water consumption. On this account, water consumption per vehicle at Mercedes-Benz Cars decreased 8% 1 as compared to 2022. Mercedes-Benz Vans was able to reduce water consumption per vehicle by 6% 1 compared to the previous year2.\n\n## Less waste\n\nThe goal of the Mercedes-Benz Group is to keep the waste volumes generated in its production operations as low as possible. To this end, the Group seeks to continuously reduce overall waste, including waste for disposal. As it does so, the Mercedes-Benz Group's top priority is to prevent waste.\n\nIn order to reduce total waste, it is important to ensure transparency concerning the waste value streams and to correctly separate the various types of waste. The Mercedes-Benz Group generally works with licensed and regularly certified waste disposal companies to ensure the professional disposal of our waste materials in accordance with legal requirements. Furthermore, it continues to reduce waste such as clippings, sands, filter media and slurries through the implementation of new or optimized production processes.\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz Group also works with some suppliers in order to avoid waste. For example, load carriers and the materials used for securing loads and cargo are now, where possible, reused in a closed cycle, as are steel barrels (e.g. for thermal conductive paste, adhesives and lubricants).\n\nIn the reporting year, Mercedes-Benz Cars reduced the total amount of waste per vehicle by 9% 1 and the amount of waste for disposal per vehicle by 42% 1 compared to 2022. At Mercedes-Benz Vans, total waste per vehicle increased by 16% 1 as compared to 2022, while waste volume for disposal per vehicle fell by 21% 1 during the reporting year2.",

It meets the challenges and requirements of the personnel transformation with a corresponding personnel strategy, among other things.\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz Group continuously invests in the qualification of its employees, is constantly expanding its range of further qualification courses and at the same time recruits new talent with appropriate skills profiles. In order to attract such employees and retain them for the long term, the Mercedes-Benz Group takes measures to create and further enhance an attractive and future-oriented working environment for its employees, among other ways by offering them flexible forms of work. Particularly in challenging times, respectful and trust-based cooperation between the workforce and the management is extremely important. The Mercedes-Benz Group therefore promotes a diverse and inclusive corporate, leadership and cooperative\n\n- 1 Status 31 December 2023: active employees (employees including holiday workers, without thesis writers, interns, working students, PhD students, senior experts and trainees) of Mercedes-Benz Group\n\nculture. At the same time, the Group also wants to provide its employees with a healthy and safe working environment.\n\n## Firmly establishing work and social standards\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz Group is committed to fulfilling its social responsibilities. As a participant in the UN Global Compact, the Mercedes-Benz Group AG has committed itself, among other things, to respecting key employee rights. Based on the labour and social standards of the International Labour Organization (ILO), Mercedes-Benz Group AG revised and supplemented its own Groupwide principles of social responsibility in 2021 and published them as the Principles of Social Responsibility and Human Rights.\n\nReported violations of the Integrity Code or other internal Group regulations, as well as legal regulations, that pose a high risk to the Mercedes-Benz Group and its employees or to other people are followed up by the whistleblowing system BPO (Business & People Protection Office).\n\n## Responsible transformation\n\nDepending on their product portfolio and the size of their operations, the Mercedes-Benz Group sites, and thus the company's various groups of employees, are affected to different degrees by digitalization and the electrification of the automotive industry.",

        "page_content": "A successful and responsible transformation process requires goals as well as measures that are geared towards them. To this end, various sites - primarily the Powertrain and manufacturing plants, but also the sales department - developed goals for their transformation process. On the basis of these goals, the sites identified key topics with corresponding measures. These measures primarily include training and retraining opportunities for employees. The company also makes it possible for employees to move between different sites in order to take on new jobs or continue to work at the corresponding level of qualification.\n\nOne focus of HR work at the Mercedes-Benz Group is to win over, motivate and empower employees for change. For example, the TransformatiON initiative was launched in the 'Powertrain Network' 1 in 2022. With this initiative, the company wants to explore new communication channels in order to better inform, involve and support employees during the transition. TransformatiON focuses increasingly on information, interaction, dialogue and feedback as central components.\n\nIn addition to courage, commitment and a willingness to change, successful transformation requires security above all. That's why the company signed an agreement in 2017 that gives the employees at Mercedes-Benz Group AG, Mercedes-Benz AG and Mercedes-Benz Intellectual Property GmbH & Co. KG a job-security\n\nguarantee for the period until the end of 2029. This works agreement generally excludes the possibility of business-related layoffs until 31 December 2029.\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz Group in Germany has also made agreements that will enable it to react flexibly to market fluctuations and to retain the core workforce and jobs within the Group. The provisions of the general works agreement 'DMove' have been extended until the end of 2024 for the Mercedes-Benz Group AG and Mercedes-Benz AG sites (plants and headquater) in Germany 2 . At the Mercedes-Benz Group, temporary workers supplement the core workforce; they do not replace it.\n\n## Leadership culture\n\nManagers have a special role and responsibility in the transformation process. At the Mercedes-Benz Group, the leadership culture and the way people work together are therefore constantly evolving. The various units and departments use the shared basis of the Group-wide People Principles to focus on their own specific areas and develop appropriate measures. The principles serve as a basis for leadership and cooperation at the Mercedes-Benz Group. Current offers and suggestions support managers in their sustainable further development and help them engage in lifelong learning. Because learning and cultural development take place at all levels, the Group introduced a format tailored to top management in the reporting year in the\n\nform of Executive Inspiration Talks. It combines external suggestions on the topic of leadership culture with networking and cross-functional exchange.\n\nThe hybrid working environment has changed the demands placed on managers within the Group. In order to support managers as much as possible in their roles and their tasks, the Mercedes-Benz Group offers them training courses that focus on the opportunities and the framework of leadership. In these courses, managers learn in a targeted manner about the new challenges relating to leadership with regard to innovation, cooperation, sustainable development and personal resilience.\n\nIn order to continually improve its leadership and corporate culture and further develop its work culture within the framework of the transformation process, the Mercedes-Benz Group conducts an extensive survey of its employees worldwide every two years. This was most recently done in 2023. The survey is a key indicator of where the Group stands with regard to various issues from the point of view of its employees, and where there is still potential for improvement. Other channels are also open for employees and managers to provide feedback.",

        "page_content": "## Attractive and transparent remuneration\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz Group remunerates work in accordance with the same principles at all of its companies around the world. The global Corporate Compensation Policy, which is valid for all groups of employees, establishes the framework conditions and minimum requirements for the design of the remuneration systems. Among other things, it stipulates that the amount of the remuneration is determined on the basis of the requirements of the job profile in question (taking into account, for example, the person's knowledge, expertise, responsibilities and decision-making authority) and, where appropriate, performance. However, it does not take account of gender, origin or other personal characteristics. In doing so, the Group also takes into consideration local market conditions and benchmarks.\n\nIn 2023 the expenses for employees in the company worldwide for a workforce numbering 168,336 on average (including temporary workers during holidays) amounted to:\n\n- -    \u20ac13,848 million on wages and salaries\n- -    \u20ac2,376 million on social welfare services\n- -    \u20ac409 million on retirement benefits\n\nThe variable remuneration for activities in management positions at levels one to three comprises both a shortterm and, as a rule, a long-term component. The shortterm component is based not only on financial targets\n\nbut also on transformation goals and non-financial targets. Since 2023, the long-term component has also been based on ESG targets.\n\nTo measure the company's success, sustainability aspects are also be taken into account. Depending on the results, employees who are covered by collective wage agreements at Mercedes-Benz Group AG, Mercedes-Benz AG and Mercedes-Benz Intellectual Property GmbH & Co. KG and managers at management level four (Executive) receive a success and profit-sharing bonus since 2023.\n\nThe internal auditing department conducts random annual internal audits to determine whether selected aspects of the Corporate Compensation Policy are being complied with. As part of these audits, no material breach of the guideline was identified in 2023.\n\n## Flexible working-time models\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz Group continuously further develops its working culture - and thus its working-time arrangements as well. It is increasingly relying on hybrid forms of work, a mix of on-site and mobile working depending on tasks and work processes. The 'Remote Working' general works agreement, valid since 2016, was converted into a group works agreement at the beginning of 2023. Thereby, and through the ongoing exchange with the works council, the Group is creating the necessary framework conditions for hybrid working models in Germany and developing them further. For example, employees of the Mercedes-Benz Group in\n\nGermany have also been able to temporarily work remotely from abroad for private reasons since March 2023.\n\nDepending on local conditions, Mercedes-Benz Group AG, Mercedes-Benz AG, Mercedes-Benz Mobility AG and Mercedes-Benz Bank AG offer different working-time arrangements. These include e.g. parttime work and job sharing.\n\nIn addition, employees at Mercedes-Benz Group AG, Mercedes-Benz AG, Mercedes-Benz Mobility AG, Mercedes-Benz Bank AG and other subsidiaries can agree to take a sabbatical ranging from three months to one year. Employees who wish to obtain additional qualifications - including pursuing a course of study at a university - can also make arrangements to take a three to five-year leave with a reinstatement guarantee.\n\n## Dialogue with employee representatives\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz Group acknowledges its employees' right to form employee representative bodies and conduct collective bargaining in order to regulate working conditions. It also recognizes their right to strike in accordance with the applicable laws. Important partners here include the local works councils, the General Works Council, the Group Works Council, the European Works Council and the World Employee Committee (WEC). Collective bargaining agreements exist for the majority of employees throughout the Group. Such agreements apply to all employees who are subject to collective bargaining agreements at Mercedes-Benz",

The parties make every effort to take into account both the economic interests of the Group and the interests of its employees. The results of the ongoing dialogues, and thus the rights of employees as well, are defined, among other things, in a number of plant and company-wide agreements. In the reporting year, company and employee representative bodies reached various agreements and arrangements. These include the policy on remote work abroad for personal reasons and the general works agreement on the Germany-wide job ticket for public transportation. The parties also concluded a Group-works agreement on employee participation in digitalization. In particular, this includes a business e-mail address for all employees in the production environment of the Mercedes-Benz Group in Germany.\n\nThe interests of trainees and young employees at the various German sites are looked after specifically by the local youth and trainee representatives, who in turn organize themselves across all sites as part of a General Youth and Trainee Representation (GJAV).\n\n## Training and further qualification\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz Group employs a sustainable personnel development and planning approach, because in times of mobility transition and digitalization it needs highly qualified employees with the right skills, be it for electric mobility or for various key digital topics. It therefore continuously invests in training and professional development programmes for its employees and continues to adjust its qualification and HR development programmes. The range of training professions offered by the Mercedes-Benz Group and the courses of study offered in dual work-study programmes in Germany are also changing as a result, as are the qualification and personnel development programmes.\n\n## Organization and agreements\n\nVarious company and collective-bargaining regulations form the basis of the Germany-wide training and qualification processes at Mercedes-Benz Group.\n\nPersonal and company-related qualification at Mercedes-Benz Group AG, Mercedes-Benz AG and its subsidiaries in Germany is regulated, among other things, by the Voluntary General Works Agreement on the Qualification of Employees and the General Works Agreement on the Use of External eLearning Platforms for Qualification Measures as well as comparable company and collectively agreed policies. They serve to standardize the qualification process, structure it more efficiently and integrate external training elements into the learning portfolio.\n\n## Trainees and students\n\nIn Germany, the Mercedes-Benz Group offers professional training and a dual work-study programme for internationally recognized bachelor courses of study at various company sites. The courses are supplemented by practical assignments, both in Germany and abroad.\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz Group has established a MercedesBenz Training System for Germany that standardizes company-related training content across all sites and divisions. The goal here is to create high-quality and efficient training programmes that are attractive to trainees and participants of dual work-study programmes.\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz Group provides future-oriented training as needed and continuously reviews its portfolio of training professions and courses of study in Germany. In this review process it not only reacts to current developments but also anticipates future requirements and technological innovations. Since 2021, Mercedes-Benz AG has been increasing the number of IT trainees, and in autumn of 2022 it also integrated the additional qualification Artificial Intelligence from the Chamber of Commerce and Industry. Since the reporting year, internally designed qualification modules such as Data-based action, Programming and Cyber security have also been taught as part of technical vocational training. The new dual study programme 'Sustainable Management' will start in 2024.",

        "page_content": "## Qualification and learning programmes for employees\n\nIn 2022, the Group launched the Turn2Learn initiative worldwide for the qualification of employees. It combines a wide range of learning opportunities via external learning platforms with customized training and strategic learning paths. This allows employees to combine different options to suit their needs - digitally and in person.\n\nThe Group's own specialized TechAcademies, also organized under the umbrella of Turn2Learn, provide targeted and needs-oriented training for employees in research and development and in production-related areas. For example, the TechAcademy Production and Supply Chain Management at Mercedes-Benz AG analyses current and future personnel requirements for production areas and cross divisional functions - for example, in quality assurance. The TechAcademy uses the analyses to develop future-oriented qualification as well as retraining measures in line with the needs of specific target groups.\n\nA Tech Academy that offers needs-based future-oriented training components has also been established for employees in the development units at the Mercedes-Benz AG in Germany. These training components are specifically tailored to the requirements of the development units.\n\nNon-Financial  Declaration\n\nIn order to actively promote the digital transformation in production, the D.SHIFT part-time qualification programme was launched in 2021. D.SHIFT is a retraining programme specifically for production employees at German sites that focuses on acquiring digital skills and ultimately involves employees switching to a future-oriented job profile. The programme was continued in November 2023 and the number of available slots was expanded.\n\nWithin the sales organization of Mercedes-Benz Group AG, the Mercedes-Benz Global Training business unit serves as the central pillar for the development and qualification of employees of the German and international sales organization. The focus is on the training and certification of sales and service personnel as well as dealer management. In addition, comprehensive further training and various product training courses are offered. The unit also focuses on training content on electrics/electronics (E/E) and high-voltage, especially for employees in the repair and service sector.\n\nIn 2023, the emphasis continued to be on qualifications that are crucial for the successful implementation of the Group's sustainable business strategy and digitalization.\n\n## Diversity and inclusion\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz Group is committed to tolerance, openness and fairness, and promotes diversity and inclusion. With appropriate measures and activities, it wants to foster a working environment in which employees, regardless of their age, ethnic origins and nationality, gender and gender identity, physical or intellectual capacity, religion and worldview, sexual orientation and social origins, can freely develop their talents.\n\nThis approach is embedded in the Mercedes-Benz Group's Integrity Code and in the Principles of Social Responsibility and Human Rights, among other things.\n\n## Strategic areas of action\n\nDiversity and inclusion are part of the sustainable business strategy of the Mercedes-Benz Group. The strategic areas of action for promoting diversity and inclusion involve the advancement of women, internationality and inclusion.\n\n- -The advancement of women: the Mercedes-Benz Group would like to fill more senior management positions (Level 3 and up) with women. The target here is to increase the share of women in such positions to 30% by 2030.",

As of 31 December 2023, women occupied 25.7% 1 of the senior management positions at the Mercedes-Benz Group worldwide. The Mercedes-Benz Group uses relevant data from its human resources reporting systems to review the progress made in increasing the proportion of women in top management positions. The results are reported to the Board of Management of the Mercedes-Benz Group AG in a standardized form on a regular basis.\n\n- -Internationality: the Mercedes-Benz Group also seeks to promote internationality, a global way of thinking and the cultural diversity of its workforce in order to continue its success as a global company. Among other things, the Mercedes-Benz Group does this by encouraging its employees to take on international assignments.\n- -Inclusion: the Mercedes-Benz Group welcomes and values the uniqueness of each team member and promotes equal opportunities and an inclusive working environment.\n\n## Management of diversity and inclusion at the Group\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz Group expects its employees to treat one another in a respectful, open and fair manner. Managers serve as role models here and thus have a\n\nspecial responsibility for ensuring a corporate culture marked by appreciation. The Mercedes-Benz Group presented its understanding of diversity and inclusion in its 'Uniqueness makes us strong' mission statement, which was signed by all members of the Board of Management.\n\nThe framework and processes here are designed by the Group-wide Integrity function and the Diversity & Inclusion Management function. The latter is part of Human Relations. It defined the three strategic areas of action in cooperation with the members of the Board of Management of Mercedes-Benz Group AG and initiates overarching projects, training programmes and awareness-raising measures.\n\nThe diversity and inclusion management system is grounded in the principle of inclusion for all employees. The idea here is to always attract highly qualified specialists and managers to the Group and support their professional development.\n\nMercedes-Benz Group employees who have been victims of discrimination, bullying or sexual harassment, or who observe improper behaviour by colleagues, can report such violations of policy to their supervisors, the HR department, the counselling service, their plant medical services organization, the Works Council or the Management Representatives Committee. Additional points of contact include the Group's Business & People Protection Office (BPO) whistleblower system and the Infopoint Integrity.\n\nIn addition to these internal contact points, there has been an external online information and advice platform for Mercedes-Benz Group employees in Germany since 2022. It provides information on the topics of sexual harassment, discrimination and bullying and includes the option of anonymous counselling.\n\n## Awareness-raising and qualification measures for employees\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz Group utilizes various measures to make employees around the world more aware of issues relating to diversity and inclusion. These include, among other things, qualification programmes, information events and special mentorship programmes for women. At the Mercedes-Benz Group's annual Diversity Day, employees can consciously experience diversity, take in new perspectives and understand how all employees can profit from diversity and equal opportunity.\n\nFor Diversity Day 2023, employees were able to go through four diversity online training courses in the Global Diversity Community on the employee portal, which offer specific content for employees and managers.",

        "page_content": "## Occupational health and safety\n\nThe Group utilises a holistic occupational health and safety management system. It aims to prevent work accidents, work-related illnesses and occupational diseases to the greatest extent possible and also counteract health risks. The Group also wants to maintain the health and performance of its employees in the long term and promote their well-being. The focus here is mainly on preventative measures that the Group continuously reviews and develops further.\n\n## Requirements, policies, organization and responsibilities\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz Group's occupational safety strategy includes standards for the design of workplaces and work processes in order to systematically reduce occupational and health-related risks. There are international Group policies on occupational health and safety as well as uniform principles that must be adhered to. The internal guidelines are based on international standards and require compliance with national laws. They emphasize the responsibility of managers and the personal responsibility of employees.\n\nThe international Group Occupational Health and Safety Policy specifies binding tasks, duties, necessary bodies and communication requirements for all controlled and consolidated companies. This policy is based on the ISO 45001 standard. The policy is valid for all employees as well as temporary workers whose work and/or workplace is controlled by the organization.\n\nOccupational health and safety issues throughout the Group are managed by the Health & Safety unit, which is part of Human Relations. The topics are regularly discussed and decided on in various committees.\n\n## Risk management\n\nRisk management follows the Group policy on occupational health and safety and defines instruments and risk assessment processes that are to be implemented locally. The Mercedes-Benz Group's Health & Safety unit takes a preventative approach so that employees do not have accidents or suffer from impaired health. In order to identify significant risks at an early stage, an evaluation (safety due diligence) is carried out every five years at all consolidated and controlled production sites with more than 500 employees. Risk assessment is an important tool for evaluating potential risks and defining measures. At the Mercedes-Benz Group, this is done with the help of standardized and globally available software, for example. The Mercedes-Benz Group also assesses the mental and ergonomic stress caused by workplaces and the working environment.\n\n## Company health management and mental health\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz Group offers its employees in Germany occupational health advice and screening as well as measures and services from the company's own health programme and social counselling service. The company health management system in Germany aims to promote the mental and physical health and well-being of the employees. Internationally, the\n\nMercedes-Benz Group focuses on medical care, prevention strategies and the ergonomic design of workplaces.\n\n## Management of occupational safety\n\nAt various sites, the Mercedes-Benz Group has its management systems for occupational health and safety (OHS) voluntarily certified in accordance with the ISO 45001 standard. In 2023, the Jawor site (Poland) received voluntary certification of its management system in accordance with ISO 45001 for the first time. Every five years, officers from Corporate Safety use the previously mentioned safety due diligence process to check the safety standards at the Group-owned production sites to ensure they comply with those of the binding Group policy concerning occupational health and safety and determine whether a functioning occupational health and safety management system is in place. The international Mercedes-Benz CKD sites in India, Vietnam, Thailand and Malaysia as well as the AMG production plants in the UK and Germany were evaluated as planned in 2023. The results were communicated to and followed up in the relevant committees.\n\nThe Group also raises its employees' awareness of ergonomics and occupational safety. In order to create a sustainable 'safety-first culture' and permanently reduce the number of accidents at work, the MercedesBenz Group launched the 'We work SAFE!' initiative in 2022 and continued it in the reporting year.",

The focus was initially on sites in Germany. As part of the initiative, the Mercedes-Benz Group also assesses risks in cooperation with external companies. To further increase safety in this context, it has stepped up checks on construction sites and introduced a consequences management system for any incorrect behaviour detected.\n\nA reporting procedure helps the Mercedes-Benz Group achieve its occupational health and safety targets. Since 2023, a uniform accident documentation system has been available to the Group worldwide, from which standardized key figures can be derived in compliance with applicable data protection regulations.\n\nEvery accident is analysed in order to determine the sequence of events and initiate preventative measures. Data on accidents from which other sites can learn and derive measures is sent to all occupational safety experts at all sites worldwide. The Mercedes-Benz Group uses the information provided by the system to produce monthly reports on Group-wide accident statistics.\n\nDuring the reporting year, the Mercedes-Benz Group's production sites had an accident frequency of 3.8 1,2 .\n\n- 1 Mercedes-Benz Group, consolidated and controlled production sites including selected high-risk development areas and the Global Logistics Center (Scope corresponds to that of previous years): number of occupational accidents registered in the system with at least one day of absence per 1 million hours of attendance.\n- 2  The key figures were audited in order to obtain limited assurance as part of a separate assurance engagement of the sustainability report.",

Accident-free driving - this vision drives the MercedesBenz Group and is a fixed component of its sustainable business strategy. The Group's driver assistance systems are intended to offer drivers and other occupants a high level of safety. These systems can help drivers avoid or safely manage critical situations on the road in order to protect both vehicle occupants and other road users.\n\nReal-life safety is the safety philosophy at the Mercedes-Benz Group. For decades, the Mercedes-Benz Group's own systematic accident research, which is integrated into vehicle development, has formed the basis for new safety systems. This research also analyses real accidents and uses the knowledge gained from such analyses to assess new technologies from a vehicle safety perspective.\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz Group utilizes its holistic Integral Safety concept in its vehicle development activities. This concept describes how Mercedes-Benz divides the utilization of safety systems into four phases: assistance during driving, preparation for a possible accident, protection during an accident and help after an accident. The Group's safety measures establish a bridge between active and passive safety within these four phases - i.e. between accident prevention (phases 1 and 2) and protection when an accident occurs (phases 3 and 4). The objectives and decisions in the area of road safety are assured by the Steering Committee Integral Safety (LK IS) and implemented in conjunction with the participants of the product projects. The LK IS reports directly to the Research & Development Executive Committee of Mercedes-Benz AG.\n\n## Cooperation to further improve vehicle safety\n\nThe goal of increasing safety on the road can only be achieved though collaboration, and that is why the Mercedes-Benz Group establishes partnerships and participates in research projects. The Mercedes-Benz Group has been involved in the 'Tech Center i-protect' strategic cooperation project since 2016. The project includes partners from business, government and scientific institutes. Within this cooperation the MercedesBenz Group is working on projects such as new restraint systems for future vehicle interiors. It is also utilizing digital accident research methods and trying out new approaches, such as the use of accident simulations involving digital models of human beings.\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz Group also uses educational programmes to raise public awareness of vehicle safety and road safety.\n\n## Advantages and risks of the new systems\n\nFewer accidents, greater road safety: this is one of the objectives associated with the utilization of automated and autonomous vehicle systems. In pursuing these goals, the Mercedes-Benz Group also considers ethical and legal risks associated with automated systems. Thus they are already taken into account in product development. The company is implementing data protection principles and standards along the entire value chain in accordance with the 'privacy by design' maxim. The Group is also integrating ethical considerations into conditionally automated and highly automated driving",

To this end, an interdisciplinary committee structure has been set up to deal with issues such as the responsible use of data and taking into account the needs of all road users who encounter automated vehicles on the road. The objective of this approach is to increase both the safety and the acceptance of the Group's products.\n\n## Assistance and safety systems\n\nInnovations in assistance and safety systems are evaluated on the basis of the contribution they make to road safety, both at the vehicle level and for road safety in general. The Mercedes-Benz Group's specialists are continuously working on increasing road safety and equipping vehicles - across several SAE levels right up to automated driving - with ever more powerful\n\n1    Further information: IIHS test results:\n\n2   Further information: Euro NCAP test results:\n\nEQE SUV\n\nw\n\nhttps://www.euroncap.com/en/results/mercedes-benz/eqe+suv/50192\n\n,\n\nSpecial assessment for assistance systems\n\nw\n\nhttps://www.euroncap.com/en/ratings-re-\n\nwards/assisted-driving-gradings\n\nassistance systems that can help to prevent accidents or reduce their severity. For example, Mercedes-Benz vehicles equipped with driving assistance systems can support drivers when they steer, brake and accelerate (SAE Level 2).\n\nDriving assistance systems can react differently to the danger of a collision, depending on the situation. The Active Brake Assist system, which comes as standard equipment in Mercedes-Benz cars, is a good example of this. Active Brake Assist can help reduce the severity of - or entirely prevent - accidents involving vehicles ahead or pedestrians crossing the carriageway. Speed Limit Assist, for example, notifies the driver of the current speed limit. It has been standard equipment in the Mercedes-Benz A-Class since 2018. Since then, it has also been integrated into further models and its features have been expanded.\n\n## Ratings and awards\n\nModels from Mercedes-Benz Cars repeatedly earn top marks in safety tests conducted by independent institutes, such as the holistic testing program NCAP and the holistic ratings of the U.S. Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) 1 . The latter assesses not only crash safety but also accident-prevention and lighting systems.\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz C-Class, GLC-Class and GLE-Class received the IIHS 2023 TOP SAFETY PICK+ award for the 2023 model year.\n\nIn addition, the Mercedes EQE received top Euro NCAP 2 ratings twice: the maximum rating of five stars in the Euro NCAP safety ratings and the overall rating of 'very good' for the optional driving assistance package in the special rating for assistance systems. The E-Class also received an overall rating of 'very good' in the special assessment for assistance systems.\n\n## Assistance and automation functions\n\nThe DRIVE PILOT 3 has been available to order in Germany since May 2022. Under certain conditions, the system enables conditional driving automation on motorways (SAE Level 3).\n\nMercedes-Benz AG plans to deliver the first vehicles with DRIVE PILOT at the beginning of 2024. The special 2024 model year EQS sedans and S-Classes will be available through participating authorized MercedesBenz dealerships in California and Nevada. DRIVE PILOT takes over the driving task in heavy traffic or in traffic jam situations on suitable motorway sections at speeds of up to 40 mph (up to 60 km/h in Germany).",

This is especially the case during times of upheaval and transformation. Hence, integrity and compliance are very important to the Mercedes-Benz Group.\n\nPutting integrity into practice contributes to the success of the Mercedes-Benz Group. That's why integrity is a central element of the Mercedes-Benz Group's corporate culture and an enabler that is an integral part of the company's sustainable business strategy. For the Group, this involves more than just obeying laws and regulations. The Mercedes-Benz Group also aligns all its actions with its corporate principles, which in particular include fairness, diversity, responsibility, respect, openness and transparency.\n\n## Organization and areas of responsibility\n\nAt the Mercedes-Benz Group, integrity, compliance and legal affairs are combined into the executive division Integrity, Governance & Sustainability. It supports all corporate units in their efforts to embed these topics in daily business activities.\n\n'Integrity Management & Corporate Responsibility' is part of this Board of Management division. Among other things, it works to promote and enhance integrity within the Mercedes-Benz Group and create a shared understanding of integrity. The aim is to assist the business units in embedding integrity into their day-to-day work on their own responsibility. The goal is to avoid possible risks that can arise due to unethical behaviour and thus to contribute to the long-term success of the MercedesBenz Group. The Head of Integrity Management & Corporate Responsibility reports directly to the member of\n\nthe Board of Management responsible for Integrity, Governance & Sustainability.\n\n## Integrity Code and corporate principles\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz Group requires and empowers its employees to consistently uphold its corporate principles. The Integrity Code, which is valid throughout the Group, provides them with guidance because it serves as the shared standard of values, defines the guidelines for all conduct and helps the company make the right decisions.\n\nThe Integrity Code is binding on all employees of Mercedes-Benz Group AG and all the Group companies worldwide. It includes, among other things, regulations concerning corruption prevention measures, respect for human rights, data management and compliance with technical product requirements. The Integrity Code that was revised in 2022 was communicated to employees at the beginning of the reporting year; it is available on the employee portal in eleven languages along with all the key information on its application.\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz Group has also formulated a special set of requirements for managers in the Integrity Code. In particular, it expects managers to serve as role models through their ethical behaviour.",

        "page_content": "## Information, dialogue and training\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz Group established its Infopoint Integrity in order to promote a culture of integrity at the Company. The Infopoint works with experts for legal and human resources topics, data protection, compliance as well as diversity and sustainability, among others, and serves as the central point of contact for questions concerning ethical behaviour for all of the Group's employees. It either provides direct support or connects employees with the appropriate contacts.\n\nThe Integrity Network, which is made up of representatives from the business units, aims to embed integrity in day-to-day business and make it tangible for employees. The semi-annual member reports also provide insights into the integrity activities of the business units. The Integrity Network implemented the package of measures of the 'Integrity Experience'. This was based on individually combinable modules on various integrity topics, which were provided by the Integrity Management department. With the help of these measures, employees were able to consciously reflect on their own actions in their day-to-day work.\n\nIn addition, the Annual Integrity Meeting was held in May 2023 with members of the Board of Management, members of the Integrity Network and an external expert. Under the motto 'Integrity meets\u2026 TRANSFORMATION', the participants discussed how integrity can be implemented in one's day-to-day professional life in times of change.\n\nIn addition, the employees in administrative areas at Mercedes-Benz Group AG and in the consolidated Group companies regularly have to complete a mandatory online training course about integrity that is based on the Integrity Code. Because managers serve as role models, they perform an especially important task with regard to compliance, integrity, legal matters and sustainability. In order to help them as much as possible to carry out this role, the online training programme also includes a special mandatory management module.\n\n## Employee survey\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz Group consistently works on its understanding of integrity, continually refines it further and repeatedly reviews itself. In addition to the feedback from the Integrity Network, the employee survey is an important measure for these activities.\n\nThe results of the PULSE23 employee survey showed that the perception of the culture of integrity among employees has improved since the last employee survey. The basis for this is an environment of trust in which managers are also open to criticism, and unethical behaviour and mistakes in the working environment can be openly and constructively addressed. The results are used in the follow-up process to derive measures and thus further strengthen the culture of integrity.\n\nThe survey results have a direct influence on the remuneration of the management.\n\nAll managers and employees can access the Integrity Toolkit via the employee portal. It includes tools for possible follow-up activities based on the respective results of the employee survey.\n\nPlans call for the culture of integrity within the Mercedes-Benz Group to be reassessed as part of the next employee survey, among other things.\n\n## The Advisory Board as an important driving force\n\nAnother driving force for the Group's sustainability work is the Advisory Board for Integrity and Sustainability. The board's members are independent external specialists from the fields of science and business as well as from civic organizations, and include experts who possess specialized knowledge regarding environmental and social policy, the development of traffic and mobility, and human rights and ethical issues. The members of the Advisory Board support the Mercedes-Benz Group with constructive criticism on questions related to integrity, sustainability and corporate responsibility. The Advisory Board convenes several times a year in meetings that are chaired by the member of the Board of Management responsible for Integrity, Governance & Sustainability. One of these annual meetings specifically serves to exchange information with other members of the Board of Management and members of the Supervisory Board. During the Sustainability Dialogue in Stuttgart (Germany), the responsible managers from the",

The Advisory Board also holds regular meetings with managers and other employees to discuss specific topics. In 2023, the Advisory Board dealt with topics such as human rights, data responsibility, the responsible use of artificial intelligence and the further development of the sustainable business strategy.\n\n## Value-based compliance management\n\nValue-based compliance is an indispensable part of the Mercedes-Benz Group's daily business activities and is firmly embedded in its corporate culture. The Group is strongly committed to responsible conduct. It expects its employees to comply with laws, regulations and voluntary self-commitments, and helps them do so. The Mercedes-Benz Group has laid down these expectations in a binding form in its Integrity Code. Through its Compliance Management System (CMS), the MercedesBenz Group aims to promote compliance with laws and policies. The necessary measures are defined by the compliance organization in a process that also takes the company's business requirements into account in an appropriate manner. The CMS consists of basic principles and measures that promote compliant behaviour. It is applied worldwide. The CMS encompasses seven\n\nelements that build on one another: Compliance Values; Compliance Targets; Compliance Organization; Compliance Risks; Compliance Programme; Training; and Monitoring and Improvement.\n\nEach year, the Mercedes-Benz Group checks the processes and measures of the CMS and conducts analyses to find out whether the measures are appropriate and effective. For these activities, it relies on information from the Group companies as well as additional locally gathered information. The Group also monitors their processes on the basis of key performance indicators. To determine these indicators, the Mercedes-Benz Group checks, among other things, whether formal requirements are being met and whether the content is complete. It also takes into account the knowledge gained through both internal and independent external assessments.\n\nWhenever new legal requirements or findings from risk analyses call for adjustments, the Mercedes-Benz Group adapts the CMS accordingly. The Group companies are required to implement the improvement measures derived from this process. In addition, the responsible management committees are informed about the results of their monitoring process.\n\n## Compliance organization\n\nThe compliance organization at the Mercedes-Benz Group is structured functionally, regionally and along the value chain. As a result, it can provide effective support - for example, by means of guidelines and\n\nadvice. Contact persons are available to each function and region. In addition, a global network of local officers makes sure that the Group's compliance standards are met. The contact persons help the management at the Group companies implement the compliance programme at their respective sites.\n\nThe Compliance Board provides guidance regarding overarching compliance topics and monitors whether the associated Group measures are effective. The Board's mission is to react promptly to changes in business models and the business environment, deal with regulatory developments and continuously enhance the CMS. The Compliance Board consists of representatives of the compliance, integrity and legal affairs area. It meets regularly and as needed, and is chaired by the Chief Compliance Officer (CCO).\n\nThe CCO reports directly to the member of the Board of Management responsible for Integrity, Governance & Sustainability as well as to the Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board. He or she also reports regularly to the Board of Management at regular intervals and as needed on matters such as the status of the CMS and its further development, as well as the Business & People Protection Office (BPO) whistleblower system. The CCO is also the Vice President Legal Product & Technology and the Human Rights Officer.\n\nIn addition, the CCO reports to the Group Risk Management Committee. From the Mercedes-Benz Group's perspective, the structure of the reporting lines safeguards",

        "page_content": "Non-Financial  Declaration\n\nthe independence of the compliance organization from the business divisions'\n\n## Main objectives for compliance management\n\n## Combating corruption\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz Group has committed itself to fighting corruption - because corruption undermines fair competition and thereby harms all of society. The Group's corruption prevention measures extend beyond compliance with national laws and also encompass the guidelines from the OECD Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions (1997) and the United Nations Convention against Corruption (2003).\n\nThe Corruption Prevention Compliance Programme at the Mercedes-Benz Group is based on its CMS.\n\n## Promoting fair competition\n\nThe Group-wide Antitrust Compliance Programme is oriented to national and international standards for ensuring fair competition. The programme establishes a binding, globally valid Group standard that defines how matters of antitrust law are to be assessed. In addition to Mercedes-Benz Group AG's central Legal and Compliance department, the Group's global divisions can turn to local legal and compliance advisers. Employees receive further support through advice hotlines, guidelines and practical support.\n\n## Ensuring compliance with product requirements\n\nFor the Mercedes-Benz Group, technical Compliance means adhering to technical and regulatory requirements, laws and standards. The objective here is to identify risks within the product creation process (product development and certification) at an early stage and to implement preventive measures. For this purpose, the Group established a technical Compliance Management System (tCMS) in its automotive divisions. Its objective is to ensure that Mercedes-Benz Cars and Mercedes-Benz Vans comply with all legal and regulatory requirements throughout the entire product development and certification process. The tCMS defines values, principles, structures and processes in order to provide employees with guidance and orientation, especially with regard to challenging questions on how to interpret technical regulations.\n\nThe 'Speak up' and 'Judgement calls' commitment statements provide all employees in the development and certification units with a basis for a common understanding of responsible behaviour in the product creation process. They were drawn up jointly by Integrity Management and R&D departments and are further embedded by internal departmental measures.\n\n## Responsible handling of data\n\nEnsuring the protection of personal data (data privacy) and information security is a top priority at the Mercedes-Benz Group. The Mercedes-Benz Group regards the protection of personal data and the security of IT systems as essential components of comprehensive data governance. The key aims are the sustainable\n\ndesign of data-based business models and the responsible, ethical and legally compliant use of data in the interests of customers, employees and other stakeholders. To achieve these strategic goals, the MercedesBenz Group is pursuing a systematic approach. Key elements are the data governance structure, the data vision, the data culture and the aforementioned Data CMS.\n\nThe implementation of data governance in the divisions of the Mercedes-Benz Group is the responsibility of the various bodies for data and data analytics. Within the Mercedes-Benz Group there is also a Digital Governance Board that includes members of the Board of Management. This body defines the framework for Group-wide core topics of digital governance and thus supports the digital transformation of the Group. The Chief Officer Corporate Data Protection at the Mercedes-Benz Group is responsible for the performance of the tasks required by law to ensure compliance with data protection rules.\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz Group's commitment to the responsible use of data is anchored in its data vision. In the period from November 2022 to May 2023, the Mercedes-Benz Group focused on revising this guideline, which is known as the Mercedes-Benz Data Vision, and deriving and launching measures to increase customer confidence. The key message of the guideline is: 'For the Mercedes-Benz Group, customer trust and the responsible use of customer data are the basis for sustainable digital products and services.'",

        "page_content": "The Mercedes-Benz Group's Data CMS supports the Group in the systematic and risk-based implementation of measures to ensure compliance with the data protection requirements. It takes into account the existing applicable data-protection regulations.\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz Group wants to further strengthen its customers' trust in Mercedes-Benz's data processing. To this end, the Mercedes me Privacy Center is constantly being enhanced, with the aim of making the privacy settings as clear and intuitive as possible. Customers use the Mercedes me Privacy Center to obtain an overview of what personal data of theirs is processed for which purpose. They should be able to easily decide and set the purposes for which Mercedes-Benz and certain third parties may use this data. The Privacy Center already covers various such processing activities, and more are planned. The portal can be accessed on the web and via the new version of the Mercedes me App launched in the year under review.\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz Group is also working on the further development and implementation of data sharing solutions. In cooperation with partners such as cities, municipalities and insurers, it tries to make data available in a way that benefits the general public while protecting privacy - for example, by sharing vehicle data with cities in order to increase road safety. In addition, the Mercedes-Benz Group is continuously working on technologies to promote privacy, and it made new developments available internally in the reporting year. The aim is to include privacy-enhancing technologies,\n\namong others, in the product design process right from the start.\n\n## Prevention of money laundering and terrorist financing\n\nMoney laundering and the financing of terrorism cause tremendous damage to the economy and society. Even an accusation of money laundering can compromise a company's reputation and could have financial consequences for the Mercedes-Benz Group, as well as for its stakeholders.\n\nFor this reason, the Mercedes-Benz Group established a two-pillar model (trade in goods and mobility services) which takes into account the different regulatory requirements in the area of goods trading on the one hand and the area of financial services on the other. Moreover, the Mercedes-Benz Group defines prevention and combating of money laundering and the financing of terrorism as central compliance goals in the Group's Integrity Code.\n\nThe integrated compliance approach also checks applicable sanction lists and restrictions on certain goods and implements measures for the prevention of money laundering and the financing of terrorism. On the one hand, these measures aim to prevent supranational and national sanctions and goods-related embargoes from being violated or evaded. On the other, it seeks to combat third-party activities that are suspected of involving money laundering, the financing of terrorism, organized crime and other types of corporate crime.\n\n## Compliance risks\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz Group evaluates its companies and corporate departments systematically each year in order to reduce compliance risks. In this process, the Mercedes-Benz Group uses, for example, centrally available information about its companies, such as revenue, business models and relations with business partners. If necessary, other locally sourced information is supplemented. The results of the compliance risk analysis form the basis of compliance risk management and are therefore also the basis for defining measures.\n\n## Compliance programme\n\nThe compliance programme comprises principles and measures that are designed to reduce compliance risks and counteract violations of laws and regulations. The individual measures are based on the knowledge gained through the Group's systematic compliance risk analysis. The Mercedes-Benz Group focuses, among other things, on the following aspects: the continuous raising of awareness of compliance issues, preventative training measures, the systematic tracking of information received regarding misconduct, and the formulation of clear standards for the behaviour of business partners.\n\nIn order to ensure an independent external assessment of the Compliance Programme, Mercedes-Benz Group AG commissioned KPMG AG Wirtschaftspr\u00fcfungsgesellschaft to audit the Group's CMS for Corruption Prevention, Antitrust and technical Compliance in",

These audits, which were based on the principles of appropriateness, implementation and effectiveness, were successfully completed for our CMS Corruption Prevention in late 2019, for our tCMS (focus on emissions) in late 2020 and for our CMS Antitrust in late 2021. The latter was the second such audit, the first having been conducted in 2016.\n\n## The whistleblower system BPO\n\nThe Business & People Protection Office (BPO) whistleblower system enables all employees worldwide, as well as external informants, to report violations of the rules. The BPO is available around the clock to receive information, which can be sent by e-mail or normal mail or by filling out a special online form. External toll-free hotlines are also available in Brazil, Japan, South Africa and the United States. Reports can also be submitted anonymously if local laws permit this. In Germany, whistleblowers have access to additional contact points such as an external neutral intermediary and other external reporting channels (e.g. the federal government's external reporting office at the Federal Office of Justice, the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority's (BaFin's) whistleblower office, and the whistleblower system of the Bundeskartellamt (federal competition authority).\n\nThe information provided to the BPO whistleblower system enables the Mercedes-Benz Group to learn about potential risks and thus to prevent damage to the Group and its employees or to third parties, as well as to protect individuals who might be harmed by misconduct. A globally valid Group policy defines BPO procedures and the corresponding responsibilities. It aims to ensure a fair and transparent procedure that takes into account both the protection of the whistleblower and the principle of proportionality for the persons affected by the allegation. The policy also defines the standard by which the Mercedes-Benz Group assesses breaches of the rules and decides on the consequences.\n\nIf, following a risk-based initial assessment, the BPO classifies an incident as a breach of regulations with a high risk for the Mercedes-Benz Group, its employees or other persons, it refers the case to an investigation unit. The BPO accompanies the subsequent investigation until the case is closed. Examples of high-risk rule violations include offences related to corruption, breaches of antitrust law and violations of anti-money laundering regulations, as well as infringements of binding technical provisions or environmental protection regulations. Personal matters, such as incidents of sexual harassment or human rights violations, are also considered high-risk rule violations.\n\nThe BPO refers information on all other breaches involving risk to the responsible department - such as HR, Corporate Security or Data Privacy. The relevant departments follow up the information and clarify the cases on their own responsibility. Examples include theft,\n\nbreach of trust, and undue enrichment valued at less than \u20ac100,000 - if the violation does not fall into the category of corruption.\n\nIn an effort to constantly increase trust in the BPO whistleblower system and make it even better known to employees, the Mercedes-Benz Group uses various communication measures to provide extensive information materials in a variety of languages. In addition, the company regularly informs employees about the type and number of reported violations and makes case studies available in an anonymous form on a quarterly basis.\n\n## Reported violations\n\nIn the reporting year, 55 new cases were opened with 75 persons affected by the allegation (previous year: 58 cases/72 persons). In total, 54 persons were proven to have committed violations with a high risk for the company, its employees or other persons. Of these, six violations belonged in the category of passive corruption. Six violations fell into the category of undue enrichment or theft in excess of \u20ac100,000, seven into the category of damage over \u20ac100,000. 12 violations fell into the category of reputational damage. In 15 cases of violations, accusations of inappropriate behaviour of employees toward other employees were confirmed e.g. violation of psychological/physical integrity, sexual harassment or racism. Eight confirmed violations with high risk referred to other categories.",

The personnel measures in 2023 included admonishments, warnings and terminations without notice.\n\n## Sales partners and suppliers\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz Group expects not only its employees to comply with laws and regulations. The Group also places clear compliance requirements on its sales partners and suppliers, because it regards integrity and conformity with regulations as a precondition for trustbased cooperation. The Mercedes-Benz Group formulates in detail what it expects from its business partners in the Business Partner Standards (BPS) and specifically for its suppliers in the Responsible Sourcing Standards (RSS); both documents are publicly available on the Group website.\n\nIn the selection of direct sales partners and in existing sales partnerships, the Mercedes-Benz Group ensures that its business partners comply with laws and observe ethical principles. For this purpose, we use a globally standardized, risk-based Sales Business Partner Due Diligence Process. All new sales partners are subjected to a due diligence process. A partnership is only possible if this process is successfully completed. The risk-based review takes into account, among other things, the planned business model, the country risk and the involvement of third parties and government contacts. The concrete risks are determined using\n\nadditional specific questionnaires. During the ongoing cooperation with the sales partners, the existing due diligence processes are reviewed on an ad hoc or cyclical basis depending on the risks identified. Another component of the due diligence process is permanent monitoring, in which the Group continuously checks existing sales partners in relevant databases and valid sanctions lists in order to identify potential breaches of integrity. If a partner fails to comply with the Group standards or if there are breaches of integrity that cannot be resolved, the Mercedes-Benz Group reserves the right to terminate the selection process or the cooperation. In conjunction with the procurement departments, the Group is constantly enhancing the existing processes for the selection of and cooperation with its suppliers.\n\nOn the basis of the BPS and RSS standards and the Integrity Code, the Mercedes-Benz Group makes webbased Compliance Awareness Modules (CAMs) available to both for sales business partners and suppliers. These modules are intended to sensitize them to relevant integrity and compliance requirements such as those related to anti-corruption measures and technical Compliance. Through these measures, the MercedesBenz Group also offers its sales business partners and suppliers extensive assistance for dealing with possible relevant compliance risks.\n\n## Communication and training\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz Group offers an extensive range of compliance training courses that are based on its Integrity Code - for example, courses for employees in administrative areas and for members of the Supervisory Board and the executive management of Group companies.\n\nThe contents and topics of the training courses are tailored to the roles and functions of the respective target group. The Mercedes-Benz Group regularly analyses the need for its training programme, expands or adapts it as necessary and conducts evaluations.",

For this reason, upholding human rights is an area of action of its sustainable business strategy. The Mercedes-Benz Group also introduced a corresponding risk-based system to uphold ongoing human rights due diligence obligation. The measurable targets and key figures for the system are defined in the sustainable business strategy.\n\n## Policy commitment\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz Group is committed to ensuring that human rights are respected and upheld along the entire value chain in all Group companies and by partners, particularly suppliers. The Principles of Social Responsibility and Human Rights reflect this self-commitment. They supplement and specify the Integrity Code with respect to the principles of human rights and good working conditions and are binding for all managers and employees of the Mercedes-Benz Group AG as well as the consolidated Group companies worldwide.\n\n## Organizational embedding\n\nOverarching activities relating to human rights issues are managed by the Mercedes-Benz Group AG executive division Integrity, Governance & Sustainability. This division is responsible for the Principles of Social Responsibility and Human Rights as well as for enhancing the human rights due diligence obligations within the Mercedes-Benz Group via the Group's Human Rights Respect System (HRRS). The responsible member of the Board of Management continues to develop the topic in line with the targets set by the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board. To this end, this member regularly obtains information and corresponding reports about the Company's human rights activities.\n\nThe Chief Compliance Officer of the Mercedes-Benz Group is also the Group's Human Rights Officer. He is a member of the Group Sustainability Committee and reports to the Board of Management member responsible for Integrity, Governance & Sustainability. The Human Rights Officer is responsible for monitoring compliance with the Principles of Social Responsibility and Human Rights and the HRRS. He reports annually and as needed to the Mercedes-Benz Group AG Board of Management and other bodies on particularly relevant human rights issues and the status of implementation of the Principles of Social Responsibility and Human Rights.",

        "page_content": "Non-Financial  Declaration\n\nThe Social Compliance department helps with the definition of human rights due diligence requirements within the Mercedes-Benz Group and towards suppliers. Moreover, it works closely with the specialist units responsible for operational implementation of the company's human rights due diligence obligations, and with the procurement units in particular.\n\n## Human Rights Respect System (HRRS)\n\nThe HRRS is the Mercedes-Benz Group's approach to fulfilling its human rights due diligence obligations. It encompasses the protection of our own employees through the Group-wide Social Compliance Management System (Social CMS) in Group companies as well as processes for human rights due diligence in supply chains as part of Supplier Compliance Risk Management (SCRM) for direct suppliers (Tier 1) and, risk-based, indirect suppliers (beyond Tier 1).\n\nThe HRRS should be understood as a due diligence cycle that basically consists of four steps: 1. Risk assessment, 2. Programme implementation, 3. Monitoring, and 4. Reporting. It is designed to systematically identify risks and potential and actual negative impacts of business activities on the respect for human rights early on, avoid such effects and, if necessary, to initiate countermeasures.\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz Group continues to expand the HRRS step by step and also involves external stakeholders and experts in this process. The stakeholders include rights holders such as employees and their\n\nrepresentatives, as well as local residents. For example, the Mercedes-Benz Group also holds talks with international NGOs and other organizations concerning the human rights risks arising from the extraction of certain raw materials.\n\n## Social Compliance Management System\n\nThrough the Social CMS, the Mercedes-Benz Group identifies and addresses in particular those human rights risks that may arise in the workforces of its own Group companies. Employee rights are also addressed systematically and on a risk basis as part of the Social CMS. With the Social CMS, the Mercedes-Benz Group has integrated the issue of human rights into the Group-wide, systematic compliance risk management process for the Group companies.\n\n## Supplier compliance risk management\n\nAs part of Supplier Compliance Risk Management (SCRM), the Mercedes-Benz Group conducts a risk assessment of its Tier 1 suppliers of its procurement departments for production materials, non-production materials and services at least once a year. Following an initial overarching risk assessment, the specific risks are determined using specific questionnaires. Should there be any indication revealed, the responsible procurement department initiates an extensive examination of the situation.\n\n## Identification of risk raw materials and services\n\nIn order to examine the risks associated with raw materials, the Mercedes-Benz Group first analysed the raw materials present in a vehicle and prioritized them on the basis of various factors. It has identified 24 critical raw materials. The list is reviewed annually on the basis of certain criteria, such as the country risk of the main mining countries, and updated if necessary.\n\nThe Group plans to gradually examine these 24 critical raw materials in more detail between now and 2028 and to define corresponding measures. This review consists of three steps:\n\n- 1. Increasing transparency along the raw material supply chains - especially with regard to certain components in a Mercedes-Benz, such as battery cells. To this end, Mercedes-Benz AG contacts, among others, the suppliers of the relevant components and asks them to disclose their supplier structure.\n- 2. Identification of risk hotspots in the raw material supply chains, e.g. on the basis of the specific risks in the individual mining countries.\n- 3. Definition and implementation of measures for the risk hotspots and review of whether they are effective over the long term.",

        "page_content": "In the reporting year, the Mercedes-Benz Group was able to complete 57% of the process of reviewing all 24 raw materials, thus achieving its target for 2023. The achievement describes the progress in the overall process of assessing all 24 raw materials, which includes fully complete and partially complete assessments.\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz Group also carefully checks the services it uses. Services that are particularly critical from a human rights perspective were identified as part of an impact assessment. The analysis resulted in a list of 27 services that are potentially critical in terms of human rights.\n\nWe regularly conduct such risk mapping in order to address current developments and adapt our risk classification if necessary. The main human rights risks for the identified services are then determined on a stepby-step and supply chain-specific basis and appropriate measures are defined.\n\n## Requirements for suppliers\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz Group is committed to the responsible procurement of production materials, non-production materials and services.\n\nThe Group has incorporated the guidelines for sustainable supply chain management into the Responsible Sourcing Standards (RSS). They define minimum requirements and expectations for direct suppliers and contractually oblige them to comply with these requirements, to communicate them to their employees and\n\nupstream stages of the value chain and to monitor compliance with them in their business processes and sphere of influence.\n\nThe goal here is to prevent, minimize or, if possible, bring to an end any negative impacts on human rights worldwide. The RSS are an integral part of all new orders for Tier 1 suppliers and the key contractual document for minimum and sustainability requirements. They are applied worldwide.\n\n## Measures in the supply chain\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz Group uses a variety of measures and concepts to ensure the fulfilment of its due diligence obligations in the supply chain. This includes training, preventive and corrective measures, risk analyses, documentation for tracking and reporting purposes and effectiveness checks. With these instruments, the Mercedes-Benz Group intends to increase transparency in the supply chain and to ensure that internationally recognized human rights are upheld by business partners as well, and that other social standards and environmental requirements are met. The procurement units for production materials, non-production materials and services play a key role here.\n\nIn addition, Tier 1 suppliers were continuously screened for human rights violations and breaches of environmental standards in the reporting year. The objective is to identify possible violations at an early stage on the basis of the latest supplier data. Should there be any indication revealed, the responsible procurement\n\ndepartment initiates an extensive examination of the situation.\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz Group also continued to conduct audits at Tier 1 suppliers in 2023, when it made 744 on-site inspections. Among other things, anomalies were detected with regard to working hours, the communication of our sustainability standards and business ethics.\n\nIf on-site inspections reveal deficiencies at a supplier, the Mercedes-Benz Group calls on the supplier to improve the relevant processes. If the supplier does not sufficiently remedy the criticised processes, the Group makes individual decisions regarding the next steps. In especially severe cases, these decisions can be made by management bodies. As a last resort, this can also lead to the discontinuation of the MercedesBenz Group's business relationship with a supplier.\n\n## Raising awareness of human rights issues\n\nThe Integrity Code and the Principles of Social Responsibility and Human Rights are binding for all employees of the Mercedes-Benz Group as well as the consolidated Group companies. Both are the subject of the mandatory basic online module Integrity@Work, which also covers topics related to integrity and compliance and must be completed every three years by all employees of the administration of Mercedes-Benz Group AG as well as the consolidated Group companies. In 2023, human rights compliance training was also introduced for all managers of Mercedes-Benz Group AG and consolidated Group companies",

The Group selected the respective countries jointly with the initiative.\n\n## Complaints management\n\nThe BPO whistleblower system enables employees and external whistleblowers worldwide to report rules violations. The Mercedes-Benz Group can thus become aware of potential human rights risks, can prevent damage to the Group and its employees or to third parties, and protects individuals who might be harmed by misconduct.\n\nWith regard to supply chains, suspected violations of the Responsible Sourcing Standards can be reported via the BPO. If the misconduct or problem falls within the supplier's area of responsibility, the supplier must take measures to immediately correct or eliminate the problem.",

This is also the logic behind the EU Taxonomy Regulation (EU 2020/852) that came into force in mid-2020. This regulation governs the establishment of a standardized and legally binding classification system that defines the types of economic activity in the EU that are considered to be Taxonomy-aligned - and thus environmentally sustainable with regard to six environmental objectives established by the regulation:\n\n- -   Climate change mitigation\n- -   Climate change adaptation\n- -   Sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources\n- -   Transition to a circular economy\n- -   Pollution prevention and control\n- -   Protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems\n\nCompanies that are required to publish a Non-Financial Declaration must also comply with the Taxonomy Regulation. According to Article 8 of the Taxonomy Regulation, the Taxonomy-aligned proportions of revenue, capital expenditure and operating expenditure accounted for by environmentally sustainable economic activities are to be reported on an annual basis.\n\nTaxonomy-eligibility is assessed in an initial step. For an economic activity to be Taxonomy-eligible, that activity must be mentioned and explained in further detail in the delegated acts for the Taxonomy Regulation. The EU delegated acts (Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2139 and its supplement, Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2023/2485), which was adopted by the European Commission in June 2023, contain descriptions of relevant economic activities and technical screening criteria for the environmental objectives climate change mitigation and climate change adaptation. The supplement to the delegated regulation includes new technical screening criteria that refer to both the existing economic activities and to new economic activities. Furthermore, a new EU delegated act (Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2023/2486) containing economic activities and technical screening criteria relevant for the remaining environmental objectives, was published in 2023.\n\nThe economic activities relevant to the Mercedes-Benz Group in this context are to be found under the environmental objectives climate change mitigation, climate change adaptation and transition to a circular economy.\n\nOn the basis of the descriptions contained in the delegated acts relating to climate change mitigation , the following Taxonomy-eligible economic activities have been identified for the Group:\n\n- -   Economic activity 3.3 encompasses manufacture of low-carbon technologies for transport in connection with the production of cars and vans\n- -   Economic activity 6.5 encompasses leasing and financing of low-carbon cars and vans\n- -   Economic activity 6.6 encompasses leasing and financing of low-carbon commercial vehicles\n- -   Economic activity 6.15 encompasses infrastructure enabling low-carbon road transport and public transport (charging infrastructure)\n\nIn a Commission Notice (2022/C 385/01) published by the European Commission on 6 October 2022, the Commission stated that the term 'low-carbon' only relates to the assessment of Taxonomy-alignment within the framework of the technical screening criteria and is not relevant for reporting on the Taxonomy-eligible economic activity 3.3. With regard to car manufacturer in particular and as an example, the document shows that the activity 'manufacture of low-carbon vehicles' also includes vehicles with combustion engines. For the Mercedes-Benz Group, this clarification by the European Commission means that the manufacture of all Group vehicles is to be classified as Taxonomy-eligible.",

For the 2023 reporting year, simplified reporting obligations apply for economic activities newly introduced by the delegated acts. These stipulate that only reporting in relation to Taxonomy-eligibility is required. The Mercedes-Benz Group reports economic activity 5.4 as Taxonomy-eligible but not environmentally sustainable. An assessment of Taxonomy-alignment has not been carried out.\n\nThe individual economic activities are additionally to be classified according to enabling activities and transitional activities. An enabling activity is an economic activity that makes a substantial contribution to one or more environmental objectives by directly enabling further activities to also make a substantial contribution. At the Mercedes-Benz Group this mostly applies to the economic activities 3.3 and 6.15. A transitional activity, in contrast, is an economic activity for which there is no technological and economically feasible low-carbon alternative but which makes a substantial contribution to climate change mitigation by supporting the transition to a climate-neutral economy.\n\n## Taxonomy-alignment\n\nIn a further step, Taxonomy-alignment must be assessed for Taxonomy-eligible economic activities. Only Taxonomy-eligible activities can be considered as environmentally sustainable activities, or as being Taxonomy-aligned, provided they meet certain technical screening criteria. Here, the fulfilment of certain technical screening criteria with regard to the relevant economic activities must make a substantial contribution to an environmental objective defined by the Taxonomy Regulation and, on the basis of defined 'do no significant harm' criteria (DNSH criteria), also exclude the possibility of significant interference with another environmental objective. It must also be ensured that minimum standards are met with regard to issues such as upholding human rights or combating corruption (minimum safeguards).\n\n## Fulfilment of a substantial contribution to the environmental objective climate change mitigation\n\nAccording to the delegated act, all vehicles below the current limit value of 50g CO 2 /km per vehicle (in accordance with the WLTP) as defined in the technical screening criteria make a substantial contribution to the climate change mitigation environmental objective. At Mercedes-Benz Group all-electric vehicles as well as the majority of plug-in hybrid vehicles are below this threshold. These vehicles are hereafter referred to as 'low-carbon vehicles'.",

In addition to Group-brand vehicles, the vehicle portfolio also includes vehicles from other manufacturers. The latter are reported as Taxonomy-eligible but not Taxonomy-aligned, as it is not currently possible to carry out an adequate DNSH analysis due to the current data availability.\n\nWith regard to economic activity 6.15, the fulfilment of the DNSH criteria was reviewed at the level of the operational high-power charging stations.\n\n## Climate change adaptation\n\nWith regard to economic activity 3.3, the EU Taxonomy requires a climate risk analysis to be carried out. In accordance with the DNSH requirements, this analysis was carried out for taxonomy-relevant production sites in connection with economic activity 3.3, in order to assess potential physical climate-related risk factors on the basis of material climate risks in line with Appendix A (Annex I) of the delegated act of the EU (Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2139). The analysis took into account climate scenarios from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and different time horizons, including 2040. Adaptation measures were analysed on the basis of the results.\n\nIn addition, the verificiation of the DNSH criteria for economic activity 6.5 is essentially based on the consideration of use and environmental conditions, such as heat and cold requirements in the context of vehicle development and testing.\n\nWith regard to economic activity 6.15, potential climate risks according to Appendix A (Annex I) of the delegated act of the EU (Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2139) were assessed by relevance for the implementation of the economic activity and manufacturer's specifications for the charging stations were taken into account.\n\n## Sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources\n\nWith regard to economic activity 3.3, fulfilment of the DNSH criteria according to the Taxonomy Regulation is intended to be ensured mainly on the basis of established environmental management systems and the internal environmental risk assessment (environmental due diligence process). The company has established environmental management systems at its own production sites around the world in accordance with ISO 14001. In addition, all German and the two European manufacturing locations in Kecskemet (Hungary) and Vitoria (Spain) have also been validated in accordance with EMAS. As part of the internal environmental risk assessment, consolidated production sites are evaluated according to a number of factors, including those relating to water quality, in a five-year cycle. Recommendations for minimizing risks are then drawn up, prioritized and tracked. The Group also uses external data sources to identify sites that harbour potential risks relating to water scarcity.\n\nWith regard to economic activity 6.15, the analysis shall assess that the use of the charging infrastructure does not give rise to any significant risk to the water quality and the water scarcity corresponding to the DNSH criteria.",

When developing products, the Mercedes-Benz Group considers the concept of circular economy from the very start and has set itself the overarching goal of increasing its use of secondary materials in vehicles. In addition, the DNSH criteria for economic activity 6.5 are taken into account through the implementation of the legal requirements on recyclability and reusability for passenger car models and light commercial vehicles.\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz Group is intensifying its efforts to use lower volumes of raw materials and other materials in its production operations. In accordance with the waste hierarchy, the company's primary goal is to avoid waste. For its own production sites worldwide, the Mercedes-Benz Group has set reduction targets for factors such as total waste volume and waste volume for disposal per vehicle. Waste management is also a component of the Group's internal environmental risk assessment.\n\nFor economic activity 6.15, the applicable DNSH criteria were analysed and checked for adherence. This includes the verification of the recycling or disposal of waste generated during construction and demolition.\n\nWith regard to the DNSH criteria, for economic activity 3.3 under Appendix C (Annex I) of the delegated act of the EU (Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2139), the Taxonomy Regulation refers to the concept of avoiding the manufacturing, placing on the market or use of restricted and reportable substances subject to current European legislation on chemicals. The implementation of internal processes for specification, approval and control is intended to ensure compliance with European regulations (according to Appendix C) and respective national legislations. The Global Automotive Declarable Substance List (GADSL) forms the basis for the prohibition and declaration requirement of substances in Mercedes-Benz products. The Mercedes-Benz Group also defines specifications for substitution analyses, and thus for the use of less critical hazardous substances.\n\nWith regard to economic activity 6.5, the DNSH criteria refer to compliance with various product-related European regulations and directives. As a result, all-electric vehicles are currently considered in the Taxonomy-aligned scopes of economic activity 6.5.\n\nIn due consideration of the applicable legislation and of a Notice (C/2023/267) published by the EU Commission on 20 October 2023, only tyres corresponding to the two highest classes for rolling resistance coefficients available on the market and at the same time the highest class for external rolling noise available on the market fulfil DNSH requirements for the respective vehicles. For the assessment of the respective classes available\n\non the market, the data of the European Product Database for Energy Labelling (EPREL) shall be used. The time of market placement of the vehicles in the leasing and financing portfolio was used for the analysis, and a percentage share of the vehicles with the respective highest tyre classes according to EPREL was determined on the basis of a representative time period. This proportion is applied to the leasing and financing portfolio of all-electric vehicles worldwide wherever the corresponding data is available.\n\nFor economic activity 6.15, the applicable requirements from the Taxonomy Regulation on noise, vibration, dust and pollutants must be complied with.\n\n## Protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems\n\nTo demonstrate the requirements for economic activity 3.3, ecologically sensitive or protected areas in the neighbourhood of sites are documented and taken into account as part of the internal environmental risk assessment (environmental due diligence process). Furthermore, environmental impact assessments or comparable audits outside the EU are carried out in the context of a new site or the extension of an existing site, if legally required. In addition, the Group has established environmental management systems in accordance with ISO 14001 at its production sites.\n\nDuring the reporting year, an environmental impact assessment was not required for the charging infrastructure (economic activity 6.15) that was put into operation.

Here, Article 18 of the Taxonomy Regulation references the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises, the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (including the basic principles and rights from the eight core conventions defined in the International Labour Organization's Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work), and the International Bill of Human Rights. The Taxonomy Regulation itself does not further specify the standards.\n\nThe report published by the Platform on Sustainable Finance in October 2022 (Final Report on Minimum Safeguards) assists companies with the interpretation of the scope and application of the minimum standards.

In this process, the denominator takes into account the consolidated revenue generated by Group companies that are to be included in the calculations. The revenue, as disclosed in the consolidated statement of income, amounted to \u20ac153,218 million in the reporting year (2022: \u20ac150,017 million) (see Note 5 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements).\n\nThe numerator was calculated by examining this revenue to determine how much of it was generated in connection with the manufacturing, the leasing or the financing of vehicles; the operation of high-power\n\n- 1   The key figures were audited in order to obtain limited assurance as part of a separate assurance engagement of the sustainability report.\n\ncharging stations; or the sale of second hand-goods which were purchased from third parties by the Mercedes-Benz Group. This applies to almost all of the revenue generated by the Mercedes-Benz Group. In the previous year, the revenues from the sale of second-hand goods, which Mercedes-Benz Group purchased from third parties, were assigned to the revenue from Taxonomy non-eligible activities. Since the reporting year, this revenue has been assigned to the economic activity 5.4.\n\n## Taxonomy-alignment of revenue\n\nIn order to calculate the Taxonomy-aligned proportion of economic activities (under A.1 in the table Revenue), revenues were examined to determine whether they were generated with low-carbon vehicles in order to assess whether a substantial contribution had been made to climate change mitigation. Compliance with the DNSH criteria was also monitored.\n\nFor the major proportion of the revenue, in particular from the new and used vehicle business and leasing and sales financing activities, a direct attribution was made of the revenue accounted for by low-carbon vehicles. With regard to other revenue components, especially revenue from the spare parts business and service and maintenance contracts, or attribution of discounts granted for large procurement volumes, it is not possible to directly assign revenue to low-carbon vehicles. In these cases, suitable allocations were therefore used for the various revenue components. These classifications are based on current or historical vehicle sales data for the fleet that is currently on the market and data on production volumes. In the reporting year, the share of Taxonomy-aligned revenue increased to 14% 1 . The main reasons for this were an increase in unit sales of all-electric vehicles and the expansion of the product portfolio for low-carbon vehicles.\n\nThe revenues shown below are included as an aggregation across the various economic activities.\n\n## Revenue\n\n|                           | 2023                                      | 2023                                      | 2023                                        | 2023                                      | 2022                                      | 2022                                        |\n|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|\n|                           | Taxonomy-aligned   revenue 1              | Total   revenue                           | Proportion of   Taxonomy-aligned  revenue 1 | Taxonomy-aligned   revenue 1              | Total   revenue                           | Proportion of   Taxonomy-aligned  revenue 1 |\n|                           | in millions of euros in millions of euros | in millions of euros in millions of euros | in %                                        | in millions of euros in millions of euros | in millions of euros in millions of euros | in %                                        |\n| Revenue according to IFRS |                                           |                                           |                                             |                                           |                                           |                                             |\n| 15                        | 20,223                                    | 136,987                                   | 15%                                         | 14,419                                    | 136,008                                   | 11%                                         |\n| Other revenue             | 800                                       | 16,231                                    | 5%                                          | 575                                       | 14,009                                    | 4%                                          |\n| Total                     | 21,023                                    | 153,218                                   | 14%                                         | 14,994                                    | 150,017                                   | 10%                                         |",

Equipment on operating leases only takes into account vehicles acquired by dealers from outside the Group. Goodwill acquired is not taken into account here. If a divestment is planned, capital expenditure on non-current assets is only taken into\n\naccount until the point in time at which they were first classified as held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5. The relevant additions to the assets to be taken into account amounted to \u20ac21,471 million in the reporting year (2022: \u20ac18,369 million) (see Notes 11, 12 and 13 in the notes to the consolidated financial statements). Additions that result from a purchase in the context of a company acquisition are of secondary importance in the reporting year.\n\nAccording to the Commission Notice (2022/C 385/01) that the European Commission published on 6 October 2022, the definition of an economic activity is characterized by the achievement of an output. In line with the Mercedes-Benz Group's business model, the numerator was therefore determined by examining whether capital expenditure is made in connection with the manufacturing of vehicles, the establishment of the charging infrastructure or the implementation of transport solutions for people and goods. This applies to nearly all of our investments.\n\n## Taxonomy-alignment of capital expenditure\n\nTo calculate the Taxonomy-aligned proportion of economic activities (under A.1 in the table Capital expenditure), capital expenditure was examined to determine the extent to which it was associated with low-carbon vehicles (economic activities 3.3 and 6.5) and with high-power charging stations (economic activity 6.15) in order to assess whether a substantial contribution had been made to climate change mitigation. Table Capital expenditure (p. 121) shows the Taxonomy-aligned capital expenditure, aggregated across all economic activi-\n\nties. Compliance with the DNSH criteria was also monitored.\n\nThe size of the share of Taxonomy-aligned expenditure of total capital expenditure is mainly due to the disproportionately low share of Taxonomy-aligned vehicles in the additions to the equipment on operating leases. As a result, this share only partially reflects our investments in sustainable products for the future.\n\nWhen looking at Taxonomy-aligned investments in intangible assets (mainly in capitalized development costs) and property, plant and equipment of the Mercedes-Benz Group shows much higher shares of Taxonomy-aligned capital expenditure (table Capital expenditure).\n\nAll of the capital expenditure of the Mercedes-Benz Group during the reporting year included in the numerator of the economic activities 3.3 and 6.5 relates to assets or processes in the context of already existing technologies which are connected to already existing Taxonomy-aligned economic activities 3.3 and 6.5. For most of the capital expenditure relating to the industrial business, a direct attribution was made to all-electric vehicle projects. In the case of capital expenditure in low-carbon plug-in hybrids and assets that are used to produce both vehicles with combustion engines and low-carbon vehicles, suitable allocations based on planned vehicle sales figures for the respective model series or vehicle platforms were used. Capital expenditure that is not directly related to the manufacturing process was allocated on the basis of the planned unit",

        "page_content": "sales figures for low-carbon vehicles. With regard to financial services, it is possible to match the additions to equipment on operating leases directly to low-carbon vehicles. At 24% 1 , the percentage of Taxonomy-aligned capital expenditure was at the prior-year level. There was a sharp addition to capitalized development costs, the effect of which was offset by the higher total capital expenditure compared to the previous year.\n\n## CapEx plan for economic activity 6.15\n\nA capital expenditure (CapEx) plan that has been adopted by management must exist for capital expenditure that leads to an expansion of Taxonomy-aligned economic activities or enables the conversion of Taxonomy-eligible economic activities into Taxonomy-aligned economic activities. At the Mercedes-Benz Group this affects capital expenditure for economic activity 6.15 Infrastructure enabling low-carbon road transport and public transport (charging infrastructure) that is expected to fall under the environmental objective climate change mitigation. The Board of Management of Mercedes-Benz Group AG has adopted the planned capital expenditure for the construction of MercedesBenz own high-power charging stations as part of the corporate planning covering the period 2024 to 2028.

These operating expenditures include non-capitalized research and development costs and costs arising from short-term leasing agreements. In addition, according to the delegated act relating to Article 8 of the Taxonomy Regulation, expenditure from\n\n- 1   The key figures were audited in order to obtain limited assurance as part of a separate assurance engagement of the sustainability report.\n\nbuilding renovation measures and certain maintenance and repair expenses (basically labour and material costs as well as purchased services) relating to property, plant and equipment are included. These components of the relevant operating expenditures were collected exclusively from the manufacturing companies on the basis of materiality considerations.\n\nIn a manner similar to the approach taken for capital expenditure, the relevant operating expenditures were also examined here for the determination of the numerator on the basis of the materiality considerations mentioned above to determine whether they are related to the manufacture of vehicles. This applies to the operating expenditure described.\n\n## Taxonomy-alignment of operating expenditure\n\nIn order to calculate the Taxonomy-aligned proportion of economic activities (under A.1 in the table Operating expenditure), operating expenditure was examined to determine the extent to which it was associated with low-carbon vehicles in order to assess whether a substantial contribution had been made to climate change mitigation. Compliance with the DNSH criteria was also monitored.\n\nThe operating expenditure shown below is included as an aggregation across the various economic activities:\n\n## Operating expenditure\n\n|                                                 | 2023                                         | 2023                                      | 2023                                                       | 2023                                         | 2022                          | 2022                                                       |\n|-------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|\n|                                                 | Taxonomy-aligned   operating expendi- ture 1 | Total operating   expenditure             | Proportion of Taxon- omy-aligned operat- ing expenditure 1 | Taxonomy-aligned   operating expendi- ture 1 | Total operating   expenditure | Proportion of Taxon- omy-aligned operat- ing expenditure 1 |\n|                                                 | in millions of euros in millions of euros    | in millions of euros in millions of euros | in %                                                       | in millions of euros                         | in millions of euros          | in %                                                       |\n| Non-capitalized research  and development costs | 2,089                                        | 6,230                                     | 34%                                                        | 2,149                                        | 5,602                         | 38%                                                        |\n| Other operating expenditure                     | 247                                          | 1,076                                     | 23%                                                        | 191                                          | 1,062                         | 18%                                                        |\n| Total                                           | 2,336                                        | 7,306                                     | 32%                                                        | 2,340                                        | 6,664                         | 35%                                                        |",

Appropriate allocations based on anticipated future unit sales figures of the low-carbon share of the model series or the vehicle platform were used for research and development costs that cannot be directly allocated (model series or vehicle platforms that include plug-in hybrids as well as purely combustion engine vehicles). It was also not possible to directly match the other components of relevant operating expenditure to low-carbon vehicles. The inclusion in the numerator was based on suitable allocations of current production volumes. The share of Taxonomy-aligned operating expenditure was 32% 1 in the reporting year. The reason for the lower proportion of Taxonomy-aligned operating expenditure is essentially the decrease in non-capitalized research and development costs attributable to low-carbon vehicles with a simultaneous increase in the total non-capitalized research and development costs.",

        "page_content": "## Overall Assessment of the Financial Year\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz Group successfully held its ground in a challenging and volatile market environment, thanks to the normalization of global automobile production and the remaining order backlog from the pandemic period. As a result, revenue was slightly above the prior-year figure. This was primarily due to improved pricing at the automotive segments.\n\nIn the past year, the Group achieved EBIT on a par with the previous year. At the beginning of the year, it had expected EBIT to be slightly below the prior-year figure. The Group's EBIT forecast was already raised during the year, primarily due to the positive results performance in the Mercedes-Benz Vans segment.\n\nThe free cash flow of the industrial business even significantly exceeded the previous year's figure as a result of lower working capital than expected. At the beginning of the reporting year, the figure had been expected to remain at the previous year's level. The forecast was already raised during the year to a figure slightly above the previous year's level.\n\nAccording to internal calculations, the average CO 2 emissions of the Mercedes-Benz CO 2 pool 1 in Europe (European Union, Norway and Iceland) amounted to 109 g/km in the reporting year. The emissions were thus significantly below the prior-year value of 115 g/km. It should be noted that the internal calculation of the value of 109 g/km was the first time that vehicles from the joint venture smart Automobile Co., Ltd. were included in the Mercedes-Benz CO 2 pool. Excluding these smart vehicles, the value of 111 g/km was only slightly below the previous year's figure. This is due to a more difficult than expected market environment for electrified vehicles in Europe.\n\nRobust demand for Top-End and all-electric vehicles from Mercedes-Benz Cars supported the development in unit sales and revenue, which, as expected, remained at the previous year's level.\n\nThe segment had expected an adjusted return on sales of between 12 and 14%. Improved pricing, particularly in the first half of the year, combined with continued high cost discipline led to an adjusted return on sales of\n\n12.6%. This confirmed the assessment made at the beginning of the year.\n\nAt 0.9, the adjusted cash conversion rate was also within the forecast range.\n\nSustained cost discipline enabled investments in property, plant and equipment, which at the start of the year had been expected to be significantly above the prior-year level, to be held at the same level. Research and development expenditure was also significantly higher than in the previous year, because the new, electromobility-oriented platform generation and the associated drive concept, as well as the focus on digitalization and automated driving, led to a higher-than-expected increase. The company had expected research and development expenditure to be slightly above the prior-year level.",

        "page_content": "Mercedes-Benz Vans can look back on an extraordinarily successful year. A continued very high demand for Mercedes-Benz vans resulted in unit sales and revenue significantly above those of the previous year. This underlines the strategy of focussing on profitable growth in the premium segment. At the beginning of the year, unit sales were expected to be at the previous year's level; revenue was expected to be slightly above the previous year's level.\n\nThanks to a compelling level of product quality and utility, a significant improvement in pricing, a very favourable product mix, comprehensive initiatives to reduce costs on the product, production and company levels and an increase in productivity, an adjusted return on sales of 15.1% was achieved. This figure was thus slightly above the range of between 13% and 15%, which had already been raised significantly during the year.\n\nThe adjusted cash conversion rate also increased to 1.0 as a result of the business performance being significantly better than expected at the beginning of the year.\n\nAs expected, investments in property, plant and equipment and research and development expenditure were significantly higher than in the previous year.\n\nMercedes-Benz Mobility closed 2023 within the expected range despite a declining interest margin due to higher interest rates and increased competition in the financial services sector. Furthermore, the business activities in Russia were sold as planned, but nonetheless negatively impacted results. The opening of the first Mercedes-Benz Charging Hubs in the fourth quarter laid the foundation for the Group's own global highpower charging network.\n\nContract volume was slightly above the prior-year level. At the beginning of the reporting year, Mercedes-Benz Mobility had expected contract volume to decline slightly. The main reasons for the deviation from the forecast were the growth in the area of dealer financing and higher average financing and leasing volumes for new contracts.\n\nRevenue at Mercedes-Benz Mobility was on a par with the previous year. The original forecast of a level significantly below the previous year was exceeded due to higher customer income as a result of passing on increased interest rates and a higher average financing and leasing volume for new contracts.\n\nWith an adjusted return on equity of 12.3%, the forecast range was achieved.",

It is divided into 1,069,837,447 registered no-par-value shares, each of which accounts for approximately \u20ac2.87 of the share capital. Pursuant to Section 67 Subsection 2 of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG), rights and duties relating to the Company exist from the shares only for those persons and entities entered in the register of shareholders. With the exception of treasury shares, from which the Company does not have any rights, all shares confer equal rights to their holders.\n\nThe rights and obligations arising from the shares are derived from the provisions of applicable law, in particular Sections 12, 53a ff., 118 ff. and 186 of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG). Each share of MercedesBenz Group AG confers the right to one vote and, if applicable, with the exception of any new shares potentially not entitled to dividends, to an equal portion of the profits in accordance with the dividend payout approved by the Annual General Meeting. The only exceptions here are the treasury shares held by the Company. There were 28.9 mill. treasury shares held by the company at 31 December 2023.\n\n## Restrictions on voting rights and on the transfer of shares\n\nThe Company does not have any voting rights or other rights from treasury shares. In the cases described in Section 136 of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG), the voting rights are excluded by law.\n\nShares in Mercedes-Benz Group AG acquired by employees within the context of the employee share programme may not be disposed of until the end of the following year. Eligible participants in the Performance Phantom Share Plans (PPSPs) of Executive Level 1 and eligible members of the Board of Management are obliged by the Plans' terms and conditions and by the Stock Ownership Guidelines to acquire the Company's shares with a part of their Plan income or out of their own funds up to a defined target volume. Eligible participants from Executive Level 1 are obligated to hold these shares for the duration of their employment at the Group. For eligible members of the Board of Management, the required retention period has been extended to two years after the end of their contract (with effect from 1 January 2023).\n\n## Provisions of applicable law and of the articles of association concerning the appointment and dismissal of members of the Board of Management and amendments to the articles of association\n\nMembers of the Board of Management are appointed and dismissed on the basis of Sections 84 and 85 of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG) and Section 31 of the German Codetermination Act (MitbestG). In accordance with Section 84 of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG), the members of the Board of Management are appointed by the Supervisory Board for a maximum period of office of five years. The rules of procedure of the Supervisory Board stipulate that the initial appointment of members of the Board of Management is generally limited to three years. Reappointment or the extension of a period of office is permissible, in each case for a maximum of five years. In 2022, the Supervisory Board also adopted a flexibly structured further shortening of the appointment period in the case of appointments and reappointments of individuals 58 years of age and older at the time their term of office begins.",

If no such majority is obtained, the Mediation Committee of the Supervisory Board has to make a suggestion for the appointment within one month of the vote by the Supervisory Board in which the required majority was not reached. The Supervisory Board then appoints the members of the Board of Management with a majority of its own members' votes. If no such majority is obtained, voting is repeated and the Chair of the Supervisory Board then has two votes. The same procedure applies for dismissals of members of the Board of Management.\n\nIn accordance with Article 5 of the articles of association, the Board of Management has at least two members. The number of members is decided by the Supervisory Board. Pursuant to Section 84 Subsection 2 of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG), the Supervisory Board can appoint a member of the Board of Management as the Chairperson of the Board of Management. If a required member of the Board of Management is lacking, an affected party can apply in urgent cases for that member to be appointed by the court pursuant to Section 85 Subsection 1 of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG). Pursuant to Section 84 Subsection 3 of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG), the Supervisory Board can revoke the appointment of a member of the Board of Management as the Chairperson of the Board of Management if there is an important reason to do so.\n\nPursuant to Section 179 of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG), amendments to the articles of association require a resolution of the General Meeting and, in accordance with Section 181 Subsection 3 of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG), such changes take effect upon being entered in the commercial register.\n\nAmendments to the articles of association that only affect the wording can be decided upon by the Supervisory Board in accordance with Article 7 Subsection 2 of the articles of association. The General Meeting has also passed resolutions expressly authorizing the Supervisory Board to amend the wording of the articles of association in accordance with the use of the Approved Capital 2023 and the Conditional Capital 2020, as well as subsequent to the expiration of the authorization, use, and conversion/option periods in each case.\n\nUnless otherwise required by applicable law or the articles of association, resolutions of the General Meeting are passed pursuant to Section 133 of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG) and pursuant to Article 16 Sentences 1 and 2 of the articles of association with a simple majority of the votes cast and, if required, with a simple majority of the share capital represented. Pursuant to Article 16 Sentence 3 of the articles of association, the dismissal of a shareholder-elected member of the Supervisory Board requires a majority of at least three quarters of the votes cast. Pursuant to Section 179 Subsection 2 of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG), any amendment to the purpose of the Company requires a three-quarters majority of the share capital\n\nrepresented at the General Meeting; no use is made in the articles of association of the possibility to stipulate a larger majority of the share capital.\n\n## Authorization of the Board of Management to issue or buy back shares\n\nBy resolution of the Annual General Meeting of 5 April 2018, the Board of Management was authorized, with the consent of the Supervisory Board, to increase the share capital of the Company in the period until 4 April 2023, wholly or in partial amounts, on one or several occasions, by up to a total of \u20ac1 billion by issuing new registered shares of no par value in exchange for cash or non-cash contributions, and, with the consent of the Supervisory Board under certain conditions and within defined limits, to exclude shareholders' subscription rights (Approved Capital 2018). No use was made of the Approved Capital 2018 up to the time the authorization period ended on 4 April 2023.\n\nThe Annual General Meeting held on 3 May 2023 again authorized the Board of Management to increase the share capital by up to a total of \u20ac1.0 billion in the period until 2 May 2028 with the approval of the Supervisory Board against cash and/or non-cash contributions (Approved Capital 2023).

If, during the period of the authorization until it is exercised, use is made of other authorizations to issue or sell shares in the Company or to issue rights enabling or requiring subscription to shares in the Company and subscription rights are excluded, this is to be counted towards the aforementioned 10% limit.\n\nIn order to service the debt of the convertible bonds and/or bonds with warrants issued as a result of the authorization, the Annual General Meeting of 8 July 2020 also approved a conditional increase in the share capital of up to \u20ac500 million (Conditional Capital 2020).\n\nNo use was made of this authorization to issue convertible and/or warrant bonds during the reporting period.",

These plans are based on the premises the company sets regarding the economic situation and the development of automotive markets. It involves assessments made by the Group, which are based on analyses by various renowned economic research institutes, international organizations and industry associations, as well as on the internal market analyses of the Group sales companies.\n\nThe premises regarding the economic situation and the development of automotive markets continue to be characterized by an exceptional degree of uncertainty. In addition to unexpected macroeconomic developments, uncertainties for the global economy and the business development of the Mercedes-Benz Group may arise in particular from geopolitical events and trade policy. Among them are the current Middle East conflict, the Russia-Ukraine war and other potential regional crises. Other uncertainties that are particularly worth mentioning include an exacerbation of tensions between the United States and China and a further deterioration of political relations between the European Union and China.\n\nFurther supply chain disruptions and, in particular, availability bottlenecks for critical components remain significant risk factors. Sharp rises in energy and commodity prices, higher-than-expected inflation rates and interest rates, potential disruptions of the financial market and an even more pronounced slowdown in economic growth in individual regions or worldwide may also have an impact on the development of the world economy and the automotive markets.\n\nThe risks and opportunities that can arise as a result of deviations from the forecasts of the development of the world economy and automotive markets that are presented below are described in the Risk and Opportunity Report.\n\nThe continuous planning process makes it possible for the Group to ensure that available opportunities can be exploited and that the organization can respond appropriately to unexpected risks. This in turn means that expectations regarding anticipated business development can be adjusted in line with the latest forecasts of the development of automotive markets.\n\n## The world economy and  automotive markets\n\n## The world economy\n\nThe Group expects the world economy to continue to grow at a slower pace in 2024. This slowdown will mainly be driven by the major industrial countries, whose economic development, at least in the first half of the year, will likely be affected by persistently high interest rates. In contrast, the monetary easing cycle that started in numerous emerging markets in 2023, should serve to support economic growth in those countries.\n\nWith regard to the euro zone, the absence of monetary and fiscal policy stimuli can be expected to lead to continued economic weakness in the first half of the year at least. Given the insufficient order situation and persistently high interest rates, no real recovery to speak of can be expected for industrial sectors in particular. Similarly to the situation in 2023, economic output for the year as a whole is expected to increase only slightly in 2024.",

        "page_content": "The dampening effects of the previous interest rate hikes in the United States will likely become more apparent, since they will no longer be cushioned by positive fiscal measures as had been the case in 2023. For the year as a whole, the Mercedes-Benz Group therefore expects the US economy to grow by less than in 2023.\n\nThe Chinese economy is likely to be weighed down again in 2024 by the continued consolidation of the country's real estate sector and by less dynamic demand from abroad. China can therefore be expected to record lower overall growth this year than in 2023.\n\nIn the light of these developments, the growth of the world economy is expected to be 2 to 2.5% in the current year - significantly below the long-term average. This is all the more likely in light of the fact that no positive effects to speak of can be expected in 2024 as a result of government stimulus measures or a further fall in prices for energy and raw materials.\n\n## Automotive markets\n\nThese restrained macroeconomic conditions are likely to have an increasingly negative effect on the growth of automotive markets around the world. Last year, the normalization of global vehicle production and the reduction of order backlogs that had accumulated during the COVID-19 pandemic had a favourable effect on sales development in various markets. This year, however, the impact of weaker consumer demand will likely become increasingly noticeable on the world's automotive markets.\n\nWe can therefore expect to see only slight growth in the global car market compared with the previous year. Following a double-digit increase in 2023, a market volume only slightly above the prior year's level is now expected for Europe in the current year. Unit sales for the US light vehicle market are also likely to slightly exceed the level recorded in the previous year. A slight increase in market volume is also expected for China.\n\nGrowth in key van markets is expected to slow noticeably in 2024. In Europe, the market segment for midsize and large vans is likely to remain at the previous year's level. The segment for small vans in Europe is expected to expand slightly. The US market for large vans will likely remain at the same level as in the prior year. On the other hand, significant growth can be expected for the mid-size van segment in China.\n\n## Outlook for the key performance  indicators\n\n## Mercedes-Benz Group\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz Group expects to generate revenue in 2024 that is on the level of the previous year.\n\nBased on the development of the different segments, the Group expects EBIT to be slightly lower than in the previous year in what will remain a challenging market environment.\n\nThe free cash flow of the industrial business reached a very high level in 2023. The automotive segments are also planning significantly higher investments in property, plant and equipment than in the previous year. As a result, the Mercedes-Benz Group expects the free cash flow of the industrial business in 2024 to be slightly below the prior-year level.",

The share of electrified vehicles (xEV) in total unit sales is expected to range between 19% and 21%.\n\nThe development of revenue at Mercedes-Benz Cars is in line with the sales forecast and is expected to be at the previous year's level.\n\nWith stable pricing and declining raw material prices, but also inflation- and demand-related additional costs in the supply chain and a slight decline in the used car business, Mercedes-Benz Cars anticipates an adjusted return on sales of between 10% and 12% based on the expected sales development.\n\nThe adjusted cash conversion rate for Mercedes-Benz Cars is expected to be within a range of between 0.8 and 1.0 for the year 2024.\n\nMercedes-Benz Cars anticipates a significant increase in investments in property, plant and equipment in 2024. The key drivers here are primarily investments in new vehicle architectures, the electrification of the product portfolio, and the expansion of digitalization.\n\nThe transformation towards a sustainable business strategy means that research and development costs in 2024 are expected to be at the previous year's level.\n\n## Mercedes-Benz Vans\n\nDue to macroeconomic uncertainties, Mercedes-Benz Vans expects unit sales in 2024 to be slightly below the prior-year level. The share of electrified vehicles (xEV) in total unit sales is expected to be increased to between 6% and 8% by the all-electric models eCitan and EQT (WLTP: combined energy consumption 100 kWh/km: 20,7-19,3; combined CO 2 emissions: 0 g/km; CO 2 class: A) and the new eSprinter.\n\nDue to its focus on profitable growth, Mercedes-Benz Vans expects revenue in 2024 to be at the prior-year level.\n\nThe continued high level of cost discipline is having positive effects, while opposing advance expenditure for the new all-electric van architecture VAN.EA is having a negative impact. In total, this results in a planned adjusted return on sales of between 12% and 14%.\n\nThe adjusted cash conversion rate for the MercedesBenz Vans division is expected to be within a range of 0.6 to 0.8.\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz Vans division anticipates a significant increase in investments in property, plant and equipment in 2024. This increase will be primarily driven by the further transition to an all-electric Mercedes-Benz Vans fleet of the next generation.\n\nMercedes-Benz Vans also expects a significant increase in the area of research and development expenditure in 2024. The focus of research and development is on electric drive systems, automated driving and digitalization.\n\n## Mercedes-Benz Mobility\n\nMercedes-Benz Mobility expects a slight increase in new business in 2024, while contract volume and revenue will remain at the prior-year level.\n\nAdjusted return on equity is expected to be within a range of between 10% and 12% in 2024. The forecast decrease compared to the previous year is mainly due to an expected drop in interest result and expenses for the further expansion of charging activities.",

The Group understands a risk as the danger that events, developments or actions will prevent the Group or one of its segments from achieving its targets. The risks include both monetary and non-monetary risks.\n\nAt the same time, it is important to identify opportunities in order to safeguard and enhance the competitiveness of the Mercedes-Benz Group. The Group defines an opportunity as the possibility, due to events, developments or actions, of safeguarding or surpassing the planned targets of the Group or of a segment.\n\nIn order to identify business risks and opportunities at an early stage and to assess and manage them actively, the Board of Management applies appropriate and effective management and control systems, which have been brought together in an overall risk and opportunity management system. Risks and opportunities are not offset.\n\n## Risk and opportunity management system and internal control system\n\n## Overview of the Mercedes-Benz Group's control and monitoring system\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz Group as a whole pursues the three-line model to ensure an integrated control and monitoring system.\n\nThe operating units in the form of the individual segments, Group functions, organizational units and Group companies form the first line. Their task is to ensure the implementation of internal and external guidelines, and they are responsible for the implementation of controls, operational risk management and risk management processes in their respective units.\n\nIn the second line, the risk management system, the accounting-related internal control system, the compliance management system, Group Security and Global Cyber & Information Security act as governance functions .\n\nThey define the corresponding minimum requirements and standards for methods, processes and systems for use in the first line and set the framework for cooperation. Their tasks also include regular reporting to the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board. They also support the first line in the corresponding implementation.\n\nIn the third line, Corporate Audit monitors the appropriateness and effectiveness of the implemented processes and the governance functions of the first and second lines through independent and risk-oriented audits. It monitors whether the statutory conditions and the Group's internal policies concerning the control and risk management system of the Group are adhered to and the associated processes are appropriately designed. If required, measures are initiated in cooperation with the respective management.",

In addition, in the context of the audit of the consolidated financial statements, they report to the Audit Committee and the Supervisory Board on any significant weaknesses that have been recognized in the accounting-related internal control and risk management system.\n\n## Risk and opportunity management system\n\nThe risk management system is intended to systematically and continually identify, assess, control, monitor and report on risks threatening the Mercedes-Benz Group's existence and other material risks jeopardizing the Group's success, in order to support the achievement of corporate targets and to enhance risk awareness at the Group. This also includes risks and opportunities related to environmental and employee issues as well as social factors (environmental, social and governance - ESG).\n\n## The opportunity management system at the\n\nMercedes-Benz Group is based on the risk management system. The objective of opportunity management is to recognize the possible opportunities arising in business activities resulting from positive developments at an early stage, and to use them in the best possible way for the Group by taking appropriate measures. By taking\n\nadvantage of opportunities, planned targets should be met or exceeded.\n\nThe risk and opportunity management system is integrated into the value-based management and planning system of the Mercedes-Benz Group and is a fixed component of the overall planning, management and reporting process in the companies, segments and corporate functions.\n\nThe responsibility for operational risk management and for the risk management processes is borne by the first line and thus by the segments, corporate functions, organizational units and companies. They report on the specific risks and opportunities to the next-higher level unit on a regular basis. Significant unexpected risks must be reported immediately. Risks and opportunities are managed within the Group by means of measures taken by the units responsible. The profitability of a measure is assessed before its implementation.\n\nThe possible impact and probability of occurrence of all risks and opportunities and the related measures that have been initiated are continually monitored. This information is passed on to Group Risk Management for reporting to the Board of Management, the Audit Committee and the Supervisory Board. Mercedes-Benz Group AG monitors implementation by the segments as part of its legal, regulatory and compliance functions.\n\nAs part of the planning process, risks and opportunities are recorded within an observation horizon of up to five years. Matters that have already been fully taken into account in planning or for which a provision has been recognized are not considered in connection with the risk management process. In addition, strategic risks and opportunities are also taken into account in the risk management process.\n\nThe Risk and Opportunity Report relates to 2024. The assessment of individual risks and opportunities takes place on the basis of their probability of occurrence and possible impact on the Mercedes-Benz Group. Multiplying the probability of occurrence by the possible impact results in the expected value, which forms the basis for the classification in risk and opportunity categories. In principle, the quantification of risks and opportunities in this report is carried out by summarizing the expected values of the individual risks and opportunities in categories. The assessment of the level of risks and opportunities takes into account both planned and already effective risk-reducing measures (net view) and is considered in relation to EBIT, unless otherwise indicated.\n\nRisk and opportunity management is based on the principle of completeness. This means that all identified risks and opportunities are incorporated into the risk management process via the operating units of the segments, the significant associated companies, joint ventures and joint operations as well as the corporate departments. The scope of consolidation for risk and opportunity management generally corresponds to the scope of the Consolidated Financial Statements.",

The risks are compared with the reported equity of the Mercedes-Benz Group as a risk cover.\n\nIn identifying sustainability-related risks and opportunities , Mercedes-Benz Group AG is guided by the topics identified by the materiality assessment and thus includes the areas of action of the sustainable business strategy, for which concrete goals have been assigned. Sustainability-related risks and opportunities are understood to be conditions, events or developments related to environmental and employee issues as well as social factors (environmental, social and governance - ESG), the occurrence of which may have an actual or potential impact on the Mercedes-Benz Group's profitability, cash flows and financial position, as well as on its reputation. ESG-related risks associated with business activities, business relationships and products and services, and which are very likely to have a serious negative impact on non-financial aspects in accordance with Section 289c of the German Commercial Code (HGB), are not currently apparent.\n\nClimate-related risks and opportunities in connection with the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) are associated with environmental issues and are thus also identified and assessed as part of the risk management process.\n\n## Internal control system\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz Group's internal control system encompasses, in addition to the accounting-related internal control system, controls for further business processes. There are also internal controls for Groupwide processes of Corporate Security, Global Cyber & Information Security, and the Group-wide compliance management system. Sustainability-related aspects are also part of the internal control system. Moreover, the structure and processes of the internal control system are independently checked by Corporate Audit .\n\nThe security risk management of Corporate Security is integrated into the risk management system of the Mercedes-Benz Group. The aim is to identify and evaluate security-relevant risks at the company's global locations on the basis of a risk-oriented view and to control them by means of mitigating measures. To this end, Corporate Security implemented internal controls for various security-related issues. These include the areas of property security, fire protection and crisis management and serve to protect the lives and physical integrity of people and to protect company assets, business processes and company knowledge.\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz Group operates an Information Security Management System (ISMS) with the aim of adequately protecting important information and critical IT services. The ISMS is based on internationally recognized standards and is continuously developed further. Operationally, the ISMS is supported by proactive and reactive operational measures. Proactive operational measures include, in particular, training and measures to inform and raise awareness among employees and functionaries, a comprehensive set of information security rules and technical and organizational measures to secure critical IT infrastructures, IT systems and applications. One focus of the reactive operational measures is the Cyber Intelligence & Response Center, which is staffed around the clock to defend against cyber attacks and deal with cyber security incidents.\n\nThe compliance management system , which has an interface to the risk management system, is aligned with the risk situation of the Mercedes-Benz Group and aims to promote rule-compliant behaviour within the company. The compliance management system makes a significant contribution to the integration of compliance into our operating business units and their processes. Further information on the compliance management system of the Mercedes-Benz Group can be found in the Non-Financial Declaration chapter.",

It is designed in line with the internationally recognized framework for internal control systems of the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO Internal Control Integrated Framework), is continually developed further, and is an integral part of the accounting and financial reporting processes in the segments, corporate functions, organizational units and companies. The system includes principles and procedures as well as preventive and detective controls.\n\nThe effectiveness of the internal control system with regard to the accounting process is systematically evaluated. It begins with a risk analysis and a control definition with the aim of identifying significant risks for the accounting and financial reporting processes in the main legal entities and corporate functions. The necessary controls are then defined and documented in accordance with Group-wide guidelines. In order to assess the effectiveness of the controls, tests are carried out regularly on the basis of random samples. These form the basis for a self-assessment of whether the controls are appropriately designed and effective. The results of this self-assessment are documented and reported in a Group-wide IT system. Identified control weaknesses are eliminated, taking into account their potential impact. The selected legal entities and corporate functions confirm the effectiveness of the internal control system with regard to the accounting process at the end of the annual cycle. The Board of Management\n\nand the Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board are regularly informed about significant control weaknesses and the effectiveness of the control mechanisms.\n\n## Appropriateness and effectiveness of the internal control and risk management system\n\nContinuous monitoring of the processes and systems of the internal control and the risk management system is in effect to resolve identified weaknesses in the financial year and ensure continuous improvement of the processes and systems. As a result of the complex process landscape and the high rate of change of the legal requirements concerning non-financial information, the maturity of the internal control system with regard to the sustainability-relevant aspects in particular is not yet on the level of the accounting-related internal control system. As of the reporting date, taking into account the scope of the business operations and the risk situation of the company, in all material respects there are no indications of an overall inappropriateness or ineffectiveness of the internal control and risk management system.\n\nThe effectiveness of any risk management and control system is subject to inherent limitations. No system even if it has been assessed as appropriate and effective - can guarantee that all risks that actually occur will be detected in advance or that all process violations will be excluded under all circumstances.",

The assessment of market risks and opportunities is linked to forecasts about the overall economic conditions and the development of the automotive markets in which the Mercedes-Benz Group is active. These assumptions are described in detail in the 'Outlook' section. The possibility of markets developing better or worse than in the internal forecasts and assumptions, or of changing market conditions, generally exists for all segments of the Group.\n\nPossible declines in vehicle sales may be caused in particular by an unfavourable macroeconomic environment for the Mercedes-Benz Group and in the context of political or economic uncertainties. In addition to weaker economic growth overall, factors such as high energy prices, high inflation and interest rates, and volatile exchange rates may lead to market uncertainty or a loss of purchasing power and have a negative impact on demand in the automotive sector. A lower-than-expected market acceptance of electric vehicles can also lead to risks in the development of unit sales and have a negative impact on earnings. This could also endanger the achievement of specific CO 2 targets. Industrial policy measures to strengthen local value creation in various countries, as well as government purchase\n\nincentives for locally produced electric vehicles, can result in competitive disadvantages and declining vehicle sales in the respective markets. The development of markets, unit sales and inventories is continually analysed and monitored by the automotive segments; if necessary, specific marketing and sales programmes are implemented.\n\nVolatilities with regard to market developments can also lead to the overall market or regional conditions for the automotive industry developing better than assumed in the internal forecasts and premises, resulting in business opportunities in the market. Opportunities may also arise from an improvement in the competitive situation or a more positive development of demand. The utilization of opportunities is supported by sales and marketing campaigns.\n\nThe launch of new products by competitors, more aggressive pricing policies and less effective pricing for products such as electric vehicles can lead to increasing competitive and price pressure in the automotive segments and have a negative impact on profitability. The discontinuation or reduction of government subsidies for electric vehicles can also negatively affect their pricing and cut profit margins. There is also a risk of delayed market introduction of new technologies in vehicles. Continuous monitoring is carried out in order to recognize risks at an early stage. Depending on the situation, product-specific and possibly regionally different measures are taken to support weaker markets. Opportunities exist in particular in the Mercedes-Benz\n\nCars segment due to better-than-planned effective pricing of vehicles.\n\nIn connection with the sale of vehicles, the MercedesBenz Group offers customers a wide range of financing and leasing options . The resulting risks for the Mercedes-Benz Mobility segment are mainly due to borrowers' worsening creditworthiness, so receivables might not be recoverable in whole or in part because of customers' insolvency (default or credit risk). The Mercedes-Benz Group counteracts credit risks by means of creditworthiness checks on the basis of standardized scoring and rating methods, the collateralization of receivables, and effective risk management with a firm focus on monitoring both internal and macroeconomic leading indicators.\n\nIn connection with leasing agreements, risks and opportunities also arise due to the development of the used vehicle markets. These result when the market value of a leased vehicle at the end of the agreement term differs from the residual value that was originally calculated and forecast on the basis of specific assumptions at the time the agreement was concluded and used as a basis for the leasing instalments. Residual-value management processes have been defined to counteract these risks relating to vehicles' residual values . Depending on the region and the current market situation, the measures taken generally include continuous market monitoring as well as, if required, price-setting strategies or sales promotion measures designed to regulate vehicle inventories. The quality of market forecasts is verified by comparisons of internal",

Regulations concerning vehicles' emissions, fuel consumption, safety and certification, as well as tariff aspects and taxes in connection with the sale or purchase of vehicles or vehicle parts, play an important role. Geopolitical tensions can also have a significant impact on the business activities of an international company such as the Mercedes-Benz Group.\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz Group constantly monitors the development of the legal and political framework and attempts to anticipate foreseeable requirements and long-term objectives at an early stage in the product development process. In particular, changes in the legal and political framework at short notice can be associated with additional costs or higher investments.\n\nLegal limits on the fuel consumption and/or CO 2 emissions of car fleets exist in many markets, although the target values differ from market to market. Non-compliance with regulations applicable in the various markets might result in significant penalties and reputational harm, and might even mean that vehicles with conventional drive systems could not or could no longer be registered in the relevant markets. The Mercedes-Benz Group counteracts this risk through the transformation towards electric mobility and the associated realignment of its product portfolio. Mercedes-Benz Cars and Mercedes-Benz Vans face the described risks with respect to regulations concerning mandatory targets for the average fleet fuel consumption and CO 2 emissions of new vehicles especially in the markets of China, Europe and the United States. The Mercedes-Benz Group gives these targets due consideration in its product and sales planning. The market success of alternative drive systems is greatly influenced not only by customer acceptance but also by regional market conditions such as the battery-charging infrastructure, state support and tax conditions.\n\nPolitical tensions and the associated danger of geopolitical conflicts continue to be high and are associated with far-reaching risks for the business development of the Mercedes-Benz Group. A further escalation of tensions between China and the United States and between China and the EU, the possible further escalation of the war between Russia and Ukraine and, above all, the conflict in the Middle East, the flare-up of further regional conflicts and a possible military or non-military escalation in the entire South China Sea could lead to renewed tensions in supply chains, even higher energy prices, renewed pressure on inflation rates and a further deterioration in the growth outlook. A further escalation and possible geographical expansion of the Russia-Ukraine war could especially have a negative impact on purchasing and logistics processes and on the production and sales programme. A possible bottleneck in energy supply in the EU could also lead to potential production losses at the Mercedes-Benz Cars and Mercedes-Benz Vans plants. The above-mentioned risks are monitored on an ongoing basis and mitigation measures, such as substituting other energy sources for gas or implementing energy-saving measures, are initiated accordingly; possible scenarios are continuously adjusted to the current geopolitical situation and analysed.",

        "page_content": "Individual countries may attempt to defend and improve their competitiveness in the world's markets by increasingly resorting to interventionist and protectionist measures . For example, setting up or expanding production facilities, increasing local purchasing or introducing a requirement to carry out local research and development can result in significantly increased investment or higher running costs. In addition, barriers to market access such as more difficult or delayed certification processes or very complicated tariff procedures can make it more difficult to import into those countries. Investing in those countries can limit the impact of protectionist measures.\n\n## Procurement market risks and opportunities\n\nRisks and opportunities relating to procurement arise for the automotive segments in particular from fluctuations in prices of commodities, raw materials and energy . Certain raw materials and components are required for the manufacture of vehicles and parts and are purchased on the world market. The level of costs depends on the price development of commodities, raw materials and energy, and can result in both opportunities and risks for the Mercedes-Benz Group.\n\nFor 2024, there are still risks from inflation-related increases in raw material and energy prices, which could lead to higher procurement costs. Furthermore, intense competition for specific raw materials in the course of the introduction of new technologies can lead to increasing costs or possible shortages in the supply chain. Raw-material markets can always be impacted by uncertainties and political crises - combined with\n\npossible supply bottlenecks - as well as by volatile demand for specific raw materials. The ability to pass on the higher costs of commodities and other materials in the form of higher prices for manufactured vehicles is limited because of strong competitive pressure in the international automotive markets. Rising raw-material prices may therefore have a negative impact on the profit margins of the vehicles sold and thus lead to lower earnings in the respective segment. In order to counteract possible loss of revenue, the MercedesBenz Group continuously monitors the development of raw-material and energy prices and is in close touch with suppliers.\n\n## Company-specific risks and opportunities\n\n## Risks and opportunities from research and development\n\nTechnical developments and innovations are of key importance for the safe and sustainable mobility of the future. The transformation towards electric mobility and the comprehensive digitalization of vehicles has resulted in ambitious development targets and the market launch of new technologies. In addition to the resulting opportunities, decisions in favour of certain technologies and the continuously growing scope of emission, consumption and safety requirements to be met are associated with risks.\n\nThere are risks that vehicles cannot be developed within the planned time frame, in the appropriate quality or at the specified costs. This is particularly the case with regard to electric mobility and increasing digitalization as well as software in the vehicle architecture. There is also a risk that certain digital functions could be launched on the market later than planned. Supply chain disruptions can also lead to delays in vehicle development processes and postpone the launch of individual model series. The Mercedes-Benz Group counters these risks by continuously and systematically monitoring all vehicle projects.\n\nIn 2020, Mercedes-Benz Group AG and Mercedes-Benz USA, LLC (MBUSA) reached agreements with various US authorities to settle civil and environmental claims regarding emission control systems of certain diesel vehicles, which have taken legal effect. If the obligations from the settlements are not complied with, there will be the risk that cost-intensive measures will have to be taken and/or significant stipulated penalties will become due.\n\nThe risks from research and development have risen from 'low' to 'medium' due to the increasing electrification and digitalization of the vehicle portfolio.",

        "page_content": "## Production risks and opportunities\n\nDue to the increasing technical complexity and the goal of maintaining and constantly enhancing quality standards for the luxury vehicles of the Mercedes-Benz Group, both risks and opportunities can arise in the automotive segments in connection with the launch and manufacture of products.\n\nThe launch of new products involves risks with regard to the availability of required components, the scope of equipment and the necessary production capacities especially in the course of the transformation toward electric mobility and the integration of new technology. To reduce the attendant risks, the related processes are continuously evaluated and improved.\n\nWarranty and goodwill cases could arise if the quality of the products or the parts installed in the products does not meet requirements despite appropriate quality assurance processes, if regulations are not fully complied with, or if support cannot be provided in the required form in the event of problems and product maintenance. The Mercedes-Benz Group recognizes appropriate provisions for warranty and goodwill cases. Nevertheless, it cannot be ruled out that recalls and field measures will lead to expenses. Possible claims in connection with such risks are examined and, if necessary, the appropriate measures are initiated for the affected products.\n\nPossible production interruptions that were still associated with the Covid-19 pandemic and the related uncertainties have become less likely in the meantime. As a result, the production risks are reduced from 'medium' to 'low'.\n\n## Risks and opportunities from purchasing and logistics\n\nInterruptions in global supply chains, bottlenecks in the supply of intermediate goods, and production stoppages or underutilization of suppliers' production capacities can have a negative impact on business activities in the automotive divisions. Opportunities may arise, for example, through the implementation of efficiency-enhancing measures in internal logistics processes.\n\nPossible interruptions in global supply chains , especially those caused by bottlenecks for electronic components and other important intermediate goods, can cause bottlenecks at Mercedes-Benz Cars and Mercedes-Benz Vans. To avoid such bottleneck situations for intermediate goods , scarce capacities are countered by planning ahead. Lack of availability and quality problems with certain vehicle parts can lead to production downtimes and cause costs that result in negative effects on profitability. As a globally operating company with an international production and sales network, the Mercedes-Benz Group is dependent on functioning and efficient logistics processes. In particular, capacity restrictions or surcharges for the transportation of vehicles can disrupt logistics processes, increase their costs and have a negative impact on the\n\ncompany's results. Mercedes-Benz Cars and MercedesBenz Vans analyse these risks on an ongoing basis. Supplier management is undertaken for the prevention of risks with the aim of ensuring the quantity and quality of the components required to produce the vehicles.\n\nThe financial situation of some suppliers remains difficult. The reasons for this are continuing uncertainties in connection with high commodity, raw-material and energy prices, as well as the lack of availability of components. As a result, production stoppages are possible along the entire supply chain and could prevent vehicles from being completed and delivered to customers on time. Supplier risk management aims to identify potential financial bottlenecks at suppliers at an early stage and to initiate suitable countermeasures. Specifically, depending on the warning signals recorded and the internal classification, regular reporting dates on which key performance indicators are reported to the Mercedes-Benz Group and any support measures can be determined if necessary, are agreed upon with suppliers.",

Risks may also arise from uncertainties in the planned quantities. This could have negative effects on profitability.\n\n## Information technology risks and opportunities\n\nThe systematically pursued digitalization strategy enables the Mercedes-Benz Group to utilize new opportunities to increase customer utility and the value of the company. Nonetheless, the high degree of penetration of all business units by information technology (IT) also harbours risks for our business and production processes and the units' products and services. Extensive changes in the existing system landscape, for example the focus on strategic partnerships for the transformation of the IT infrastructure, can also lead to risks.\n\nThe ever-growing threat from cybercrime and the spread of aggressive malicious code brings risks that can affect the availability, integrity and confidentiality of information and IT-supported operating resources. Despite extensive precautions, in the worst-case scenario this can lead to a temporary interruption of IT-supported business processes with severe negative effects on the Group's earnings. In addition, the loss or the misuse of sensitive data may under certain circumstances lead to a loss of reputation. In particular, stricter regulatory requirements such as the EU General Data Protection Regulation and related legislation may, among other things, give rise to claims by third parties\n\nand result in costly regulatory requirements and penalties with an impact on earnings.\n\nIt is essential for the globally active Mercedes-Benz Group and its wide-ranging business and production processes that information is available and can be exchanged in an up-to-date, complete and correct form. The internal IT security framework is oriented according to international standards and also draws on industry standards and good practices for its protective measures. New regulatory requirements for cyber security and cyber security management systems are taken into account in the further development of processes and policies. Appropriately secure IT systems and a reliable IT infrastructure must be used to protect information. Cyber threats must be identified and dealt with as appropriate for their criticality over the entire life cycle of the applications and the IT systems. Special attention is paid to risks that in the event of their occurrence give rise to an interruption of business processes due to IT system failures and to the loss and the falsification of data. The advancing digitalization and networking of the means of production is accompanied by coordinated technical and organizational security measures.\n\nDue to growing requirements concerning the confidentiality, integrity and availability of data, the MercedesBenz Group has implemented various preventive and corrective measures so that the related risks, such as possible reputational damage, are minimized. For example, the Group reduces potential disruptions to operational processes in computer centres by mirroring data, decentralizing data storage, maintaining off-site data\n\nbackups and configuring IT systems for high availability. Emergency plans are drawn up and employees are trained and regularly made aware in order to remain capable of action. Specific threats are analysed and countermeasures are coordinated at a globally active Cyber Intelligence and Response Centre. The protection of products and services against the danger of hacking and cybercrime is continually further developed.\n\nThe information technology risks are increasing from 'low' to 'medium'. The level of digitalization at the Mercedes-Benz Group and its suppliers is constantly increasing and is facing an ever greater external threat situation worldwide. Despite the stringent implementation of proactive and reactive measures, this leads to an increased assessment of IT risk.",

        "page_content": "## Personnel risks and opportunities\n\nCompetition for highly qualified staff and management is still very intense in the industry and the regions in which the Mercedes-Benz Group operates. The Group's future success also depends on the extent to which it succeeds over the long term in recruiting, integrating and retaining specialist employees. The established human resources instruments take such personnel risks into consideration. One focus of human resources management is the targeted personnel development and further training of the workforce. Among other things, employees benefit from a wide range of training opportunities and the transparency created within the framework of performance management. In order to remain successful as a company, the way we work together and our leadership culture undergo continuous development.\n\nRisks exist in particular due to upcoming negotiations on collective bargaining conditions and the associated potential loss of production. Besides the demographic development, the digital transformation also requires that the company continues to adapt to changes and derives measures such as securing a qualified next generation of specialists and managers, especially with regard to technical developments. This requirement is addressed through various measures, including targeted qualification. The Mercedes-Benz Group counters economic, market and competitive fluctuations by means of established time and flexibility instruments in order to react appropriately to the situation.\n\n## Risks and opportunities related to equity investments and cooperations with partnerships\n\nCooperation with partners in shareholdings and partnerships is of key importance to the Mercedes-Benz Group - among other things, in the transformation towards electric mobility, the associated charging infrastructure and comprehensive digitalization. Cooperation and investments also make up an important pillar in connection with the provision of mobility solutions. Especially with new technologies, these shareholdings help us utilize synergies and improve cost structures in order to respond successfully to the competitive situation in the automotive industry.\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz Group generally participates in the risks and opportunities of shareholdings in line with its equity interest, and is also subject to share-price risks and opportunities if such companies are listed on a stock exchange. After the spin-off and hive-down of the Daimler commercial vehicle business, this also applies to the Group's remaining minority shareholding in Daimler Truck Holding AG.\n\nThe remeasurement of a holding can lead to risks and opportunities for the segment to which it is allocated. Furthermore, ongoing business activities, especially the integration of employees, technologies and products, can result in risks. In addition, further financial obligations or an additional financing requirement can arise. The shareholdings are subject to a monitoring process so that, if required, decisions can be promptly made on whether or not measures can be taken to support or\n\nensure profitability. The recoverable value of investments in shareholdings is also regularly monitored.\n\n## Financial risks and opportunities\n\nThe following section deals with the financial risks and opportunities of the Mercedes-Benz Group. These risks and opportunities can have negative or positive effects on the profitability, cash flows and financial position of the Group.\n\nIn principle, the Group's operating and financial risk exposures underlying its financial risks and opportunities can be divided into symmetrical and asymmetrical risk and opportunity profiles. With the symmetrical risk and opportunity profiles (e.g. currency exposures), risks and opportunities exist equally, while with the asymmetrical risk and opportunity profiles (e.g. credit and country exposures), the risks outweigh the opportunities.\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz Group is generally exposed to risks and opportunities from changes in market prices such as currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices. Market price changes can have a negative or positive influence on the Group's profitability, cash flows and financial position. The Mercedes-Benz Group systematically manages and monitors market price risks and opportunities, primarily directly in the context of its business operations and financing",

Risks and opportunities arising from a change in commodity prices are reported in the 'Procurement market risks and opportunities' category since 31 December 2023.\n\nIn addition, the Group is exposed to credit-, countryand liquidity-related risks, risks of restricted access to capital markets and risks from changes in credit ratings. As part of the risk management process, the MercedesBenz Group regularly assesses these risks by considering changes in key economic indicators and market information. Consideration of the pension plan assets to cover retirement and healthcare benefits is included in the section 'Risks and opportunities relating to pension plans'.\n\n## Exchange-rate risks and opportunities\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz Group's global orientation means that its business operations and financial transactions are connected with risks and opportunities related to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. This applies in particular to fluctuations of the euro against the US dollar, Chinese renminbi, British pound and other currencies such as those of growth markets. An exchange-rate risk or opportunity arises in business operations primarily when revenue is generated in a currency different from that of the related costs (transaction risk). Regularly updated currency risk exposures are successively hedged with suitable financial instruments (predominantly currency forwards) in accordance with exchange-rate expectations, which are continually\n\nreviewed, whereby both risks and opportunities are limited. Any over-collateralization caused by changes in exposure is reversed by suitable measures without delay. Exchange-rate risks and opportunities also exist in connection with the translation into euros of the net assets, revenues and expenses of the companies of the Group outside the euro zone (currency translation risk); these risks are not generally hedged.\n\n## Interest-rate risks and opportunities\n\nChanges in interest rates can create risks and opportunities for business operations as well as for financial transactions. The Mercedes-Benz Group employs a variety of interest rate-sensitive financial instruments to manage the cash requirements of its business operations on a day-to-day basis. Most of these financial instruments are held in connection with the financial services business of Mercedes-Benz Mobility. Interest-rate risks and opportunities arise when fixed-interest periods are not congruent between the asset and liability sides of the balance sheet. By means of refinancing coordinated with the terms of the financing agreements, the risk of maturity mismatch is minimized from both an interest-rate and a liquidity perspective. Remaining interest-rate risks are managed with the use of derivative financial instruments. The funding activities of the industrial business and the financial services business are coordinated at the Group level. Derivative interest-rate instruments such as interest-rate swaps are used to achieve the desired interest-rate maturities and asset/liability structures (asset and liability management).\n\n## Credit risks\n\nCredit risk describes the risk of financial loss resulting from a counterparty failing to meet its contractual payment obligations. Credit risk encompasses both the direct risk of default and the risk of a deterioration of creditworthiness as well as concentration risks.\n\nThe Group is exposed to credit risks which result primarily from its financial services activities and from the operations of its vehicle business. The risks from leasing and sales financing are dealt with in the General market risks and opportunities section.\n\nCredit risks also arise from the Group's liquid assets. Should defaults occur, this would adversely affect the Group's profitability, liquidity and capital resources, and financial position. The limit methodology for liquid funds deposited with financial institutions has been continuously further developed in recent years. In connection with investment decisions, priority is placed on the borrower's very high creditworthiness and on balanced risk diversification. Most liquid assets are held in investments with an external rating of A or better.",

The Mercedes-Benz Group is exposed to country risks that primarily result from cross-border financing or collateralization for subsidiaries or customers, from investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures, and from cross-border trade receivables. Country risks also arise from cross-border cash deposits at financial institutions. The Group addresses these risks by setting country limits (e.g. for hard-currency portfolios of Mercedes-Benz Mobility companies). The Mercedes-Benz Group also has an internal rating system that divides all countries in which it operates into risk categories. Compared to the previous year, the country risk has fallen from 'high' to 'medium' due to the discontinuation of business activities in Russia.\n\n## Risks of restricted access to capital markets\n\nLiquidity risks arise when a company is unable to fully meet its financial obligations. In the normal course of business, the Mercedes-Benz Group uses bonds, commercial paper and securitized transactions, as well as bank loans in various currencies, primarily with the aim of refinancing its leasing and sales-financing business. An increase in the cost of refinancing would have a negative impact on the competitiveness and profitability of the financial services business to the extent that the higher refinancing costs cannot be passed on to customers; a limitation of the financial services business would also have negative consequences for the vehicle\n\nbusiness. Access to capital markets in individual countries may be limited by government regulations or by a temporary lack of absorption capacity. In addition, pending legal proceedings as well as the Group's own business policy considerations and developments may temporarily prevent the Group from covering any liquidity requirements by means of borrowing in the capital markets. Contractually agreed credit lines are available as refinancing instruments.\n\n## Risks and opportunities from changes in credit ratings\n\nRisks and opportunities exist in connection with potential downgrades or upgrades to credit ratings by the rating agencies, and thus to the Mercedes-Benz Group's creditworthiness. Downgrades could have a negative impact on the Group's financing if such a downgrade leads to an increase in the costs for external financing or restricts the Group's ability to obtain financing. A credit rating downgrade could also discourage investors from investing in Mercedes-Benz Group AG or from purchasing bonds issued by Mercedes-Benz Group AG or another company of the Group.\n\n## Risks and opportunities relating to pension plans\n\nThe companies of the Mercedes-Benz Group grant defined-benefit pension commitments, which are largely covered by plan assets, as well as healthcare commitments to a small extent. The balance of pension obligations less plan assets constitutes the carrying amount or funded status of those employee benefit plans. The measurement of pension obligations and the calculation of net pension expense are based on\n\ncertain assumptions. Even small changes in those assumptions such as a change in the discount rates or changed inflation assumptions have a negative or positive effect on funded status and Group equity in the current year, and lead to a change in the periodic net pension expense in the following year. The fair value of plan assets is determined to a large degree by developments in the capital markets. Unfavourable or favourable developments, especially relating to share prices and fixed-interest securities, reduce or increase the carrying value of plan assets. Risk management for the plan assets takes place through broad diversification of investments, the selection of various asset managers on the basis of quantitative and qualitative analyses, and the ongoing monitoring of returns and risks. The structure of pension obligations is taken into consideration during the determination of the investment strategy for the plan assets in order to reduce fluctuations of the funded status. Risks and opportunities relating to pension plans have declined, due mainly to lower volatility levels on the capital market.",

Provisions are recognized for those risks if and insofar as they are likely to be utilized and the amounts of the obligations can be reasonably estimated.\n\n## Legal risks\n\n## Regulatory risks\n\nThe automotive industry is subject to extensive governmental regulations worldwide. Laws in various jurisdictions govern occupant safety and the environmental impact of vehicles, including emissions levels, fuel economy and noise, as well as the emissions of the plants where vehicles or parts thereof are produced. Furthermore, regulation, particularly in the European Union, governs the external reporting on ESG topics (environmental, social or governance topics), whereby the complexity of such regulation is continuously increasing. The introduction of certain new regulations may initially be associated with uncertainties relating to their interpretation. In case regulations applicable in the different regions are not complied with, this could result in significant penalties, damages claims and reputational harm or, in case of regulations applicable to vehicles, the inability to certify vehicles in the relevant markets. The cost of compliance with these regulations is considerable, and in this context, Mercedes-Benz continues to expect a significant level of costs.\n\n## Risks from legal proceedings in general\n\nMercedes-Benz Group AG and its subsidiaries are confronted with various legal proceedings and claims as well as governmental investigations and orders (legal proceedings) on a large number of topics, including vehicle safety, emissions, fuel economy, financial services, dealer, supplier and other contractual relationships, intellectual property rights (especially patent infringement lawsuits), warranty claims, environmental matters, antitrust matters (including actions for damages) as well as investor litigation. Product-related litigation involves among other things claims alleging faults in vehicles. Some of these claims are asserted by way of class actions. If the outcome of such legal proceedings is detrimental to the Mercedes-Benz Group or such proceedings are settled, the Group may encounter substantial financial burdens, e.g. from damages payments or service actions, recall campaigns, monetary penalties or other costly actions. Some of these proceedings and related settlements may also have an impact on the company's reputation.\n\n## Risks from legal proceedings in connection with diesel exhaust-gas emissions - governmental proceedings\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz Group is continuously subject to governmental information requests, inquiries, investigations, administrative orders and proceedings relating to various laws and regulations in connection with diesel exhaust emissions.\n\nThe corresponding activities of various authorities world-wide, which were already reported in the past, are partly ongoing, as described below. These activities particularly relate to test results, the emission control systems used in Mercedes-Benz diesel vehicles and/or the interactions of the Mercedes-Benz Group with the relevant authorities as well as related legal issues and implications, including, but not limited to, under applicable environmental, criminal, consumer protection and antitrust laws.\n\nIn the United States, Mercedes-Benz Group AG and Mercedes-Benz USA, LLC (MBUSA) reached agreements in the third quarter of 2020 with various authorities to settle civil environmental claims regarding the emission control systems of certain diesel vehicles. These agreements have become final and effective. The authorities took the position that the Mercedes-Benz Group had failed to disclose Auxiliary Emission Control Devices (AECDs) in certain of its US diesel vehicles and that several of these AECDs were illegal defeat devices.",

The failure to meet certain of those obligations may trigger additional stipulated penalties. In the first quarter of 2021, the Mercedes-Benz Group paid the civil penalties.\n\nAs already reported, in April 2016, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) requested that the Mercedes-Benz Group conduct an internal investigation. The MercedesBenz Group conducted such an internal investigation in cooperation with the DOJ's investigation; the DOJ's investigation remains open. In addition, further US state authorities have opened investigations pursuant to both local environmental and consumer protection laws and have requested documents and information.\n\nIn Canada, the environmental regulator Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC) is conducting an investigation in connection with Diesel exhaust emissions based on the suspicion of potential violations of, amongst others, the Canadian Environmental Protection Act as well as potential undisclosed AECDs and defeat devices. The Mercedes-Benz Group continues to cooperate with the investigating authorities.\n\nIn Germany, the Stuttgart public prosecutor's office issued a fine notice against Mercedes-Benz in September 2019 based on a negligent violation of supervisory duties, thereby concluding the related administrative\n\noffense proceedings against Mercedes-Benz. In July 2021, the local court of B\u00f6blingen issued penal orders against three Mercedes-Benz employees based on, amongst others, fraud, which have become final. The criminal investigation proceedings of the Stuttgart public prosecutor's office against further Mercedes-Benz employees on the suspicion of, amongst others, fraud have meanwhile been discontinued.\n\nBetween 2018 and 2020, the German Federal Motor Transport Authority (KBA) issued subsequent auxiliary provisions for the EC type approvals of certain Mercedes-Benz diesel vehicles, and ordered mandatory recalls as well as, in some cases, stops of the first registration. In autumn 2022 and in December 2023, the KBA issued further decisions regarding vehicles equipped with various EU6 or EU5 diesel engines. In each of those cases, it held that certain calibrations of specified functionalities are to be qualified as impermissible defeat devices. Mercedes-Benz has a contrary legal opinion on this question and has filed timely objections against the KBA's administrative orders and determinations mentioned above. Insofar as the KBA has not remedied the objections, Mercedes-Benz has filed lawsuits with the competent administrative court to have the controversial questions at issue clarified in a court of law. Irrespective of such objections and the lawsuits that are now pending, the Mercedes-Benz Group continues to cooperate fully with the KBA. To a large extent, the remidial actions requested by the KBA were developed by the Mercedes-Benz Group and assessed and approved by the KBA; the necessary recalls were initiated. For some of the vehicles affected by the KBA's\n\ndecision from December 2023, developments, examinations and approvals of the remidial measures are still pending. It cannot be ruled out that under certain circumstances, software updates may have to be reworked, or further delivery and registration stops may be ordered or resolved by the company as a precautionary measure, also with regard to the used-car, leasing and financing businesses. In the course of its regular market supervision, the KBA routinely conducts further reviews of Mercedes-Benz vehicles and asks questions about technical elements of the vehicles. In addition, the Group continues to be in a dialogue with the German Federal Ministry for Digital and Transport (BMDV) to conclude the analysis of the diesel-related emissions matter and to further the update of affected customer vehicles. In light of the aforementioned administrative orders issued by the KBA, and continued discussions with the KBA and the BMDV, it cannot be ruled out completely that additional administrative orders may be issued in the course of the ongoing and/or further investigations. Since 1 September 2020, this also applies to responsible authorities of other member states and the European Commission, which conduct market surveillance under the new European Type Approval Regulation and can take measures upon assumed non-compliance, irrespective of the place of the original type approval, and also to the British market surveillance authority DVSA (Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency).\n\nIn addition to the aforementioned authorities, authorities of various foreign states, particularly the South Korean Ministry of Environment and the South Korean",

In this context, these South Korean authorities have made determinations and imposed sanctions against Mercedes-Benz which Mercedes-Benz has appealed. In the same context, national antitrust authorities of various countries are also conducting investigations, including the South Korean antitrust authority, which has made certain findings and imposed fines on some car manufacturers. In February 2024, the criminal proceeding in South Korea was concluded.\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz Group continues to fully cooperate with the authorities and institutions. Irrespective of such cooperation and in light of the past developments, it is possible that further regulatory, criminal and administrative investigative and enforcement actions and measures relating to the Mercedes-Benz Group and/or its employees will be taken or administrative orders will be issued. Additionally, further delays in obtaining regulatory approvals necessary to introduce new or recertify existing vehicle models could occur.\n\nRegarding the proceedings and processes still in progress, the Mercedes-Benz Group cannot at this time make any statement to their outcome. In light of the legal positions taken by U.S. regulatory authorities and the KBA as well as the South Korean Ministry of Environment, amongst others, it cannot be ruled out that, besides these authorities, one or more authorities worldwide will reach the conclusion that other passenger cars and/or vans with the brand name MercedesBenz or other brand names of the Mercedes-Benz Group are equipped with impermissible defeat devices. Likewise, such authorities could take the view that certain functionalities and/or calibrations are not proper and/or were not properly disclosed. It cannot be ruled out that the Mercedes-Benz Group will become subject to, as the case may be, significant additional fines and other sanctions, measures and actions. The occurrence of the aforementioned events in whole or in part could cause significant collateral damage including reputational harm. Further, due to negative allegations or findings with respect to technical or legal issues by one of the various governmental agencies, other agencies - or also plaintiffs - could also adopt such allegations or findings. Thus, a negative allegation or finding in one proceeding carries the risk of being able to have an adverse effect on other proceedings, also potentially leading to new or expanded investigations or proceedings, including lawsuits.\n\nIn addition, the ability of the Mercedes-Benz Group to defend itself in proceedings could be impaired by concluded proceedings and their underlying allegations as well as by unfavourable results or developments in any of the information requests, inquiries, investigations, administrative or criminal orders, legal actions and/or proceedings discussed above.",

        "page_content": "## Risks from legal proceedings in connection with diesel exhaust gas emissions - civil court proceedings\n\nIn a lawsuit filed by the Environmental Protection Commission of Hillsborough County, Florida in September 2020, the plaintiff claimed that, amongst others, Mercedes-Benz Group AG and MBUSA had violated municipal regulations prohibiting vehicle tampering and other conduct by using alleged devices claimed to impair the effectiveness of emission control systems. The lawsuit was dismissed in the third quarter of 2022. The plaintiff's appeal to this decision was dismissed in the third quarter of 2023. The decision is final, and the proceedings are concluded.\n\nConsumer class actions were filed against MercedesBenz Group AG in Israel in February 2019 as well as against Mercedes-Benz Group AG and further Group companies in the United Kingdom since May 2020, in the Netherlands, in Portugal as well as since November 2022 in Australia. The plaintiffs inter alia assert that the Mercedes-Benz Group had used devices that impermissibly impair the effectiveness of emission control systems in reducing nitrogen oxide (NO X ) emissions and which cause excessive emissions from vehicles with diesel engines. Furthermore, they claim that MercedesBenz Group AG deceived consumers in connection with advertising in relation of Mercedes-Benz diesel vehicles. The proceedings in England and Wales consist of several individual lawsuits that have been consolidated into one class action. A class action lawsuit is also pending in Scotland. In these proceedings, allegedly injured parties must actively register for the\n\nenforcement of claims (opt-in). The plaintiffs in the consumer class action in England and Wales also allege, amongst others, anti-competitive behaviour relating to technology for the treatment of diesel exhaust emissions.\n\nIn Germany, a large number of customers of diesel vehicles have filed lawsuits for damages or rescission of sales contracts based on similar allegations. They refer in particular to the KBA's recall orders mentioned above. Although the number of pending lawsuits is declining, a future increase cannot be ruled out. Based on similar allegations, the Federation of German Consumer Organizations (Verbraucherzentrale Bundesverband e. V.) filed a model declaratory action (Musterfeststellungsklage) against Mercedes-Benz Group AG with the Stuttgart Higher Regional Court in July 2021. Such an action seeks a ruling that certain preconditions of alleged consumer claims are met. Following a decision of the European Court of Justice in the first quarter of 2023, the German Federal Court of Justice ruled in the second quarter of 2023 that vehicle purchasers are entitled to claim damages against the manufacturer if it intentionally or negligently used an inadmissible defeat device.'\n\nFurthermore, class actions have been filed in Canada alleging anticompetitive behaviour relating to vehicle technology, costs, suppliers, markets and other competitive attributes, including diesel emissions control technology. In 2022, the proceedings in the United States were concluded in favour of Mercedes-Benz Group AG and MBUSA. In addition, in 2023, several class actions in Canada were finally dismissed as the\n\nplaintiffs discontinued their claims. The Mercedes-Benz Group also expects the last lawsuit pending in Canada to be discontinued and it will continue to defend itself against it until the discontinuance is final. This development leads to a material reduction of the risk associated with the class actions. They therefore no longer qualify for separate reporting, which is why the Mercedes-Benz Group will no longer report on them in the future.\n\nMercedes-Benz Group AG and the respective other affected companies of the Group regard the pending lawsuits set out above as being without merit and continue to defend themselves against them.\n\nIn addition, investors from Germany and abroad have filed lawsuits for damages with the Stuttgart Regional Court alleging the violation of disclosure requirements (main proceedings) and also raised out-of-court claims for damages. Mercedes-Benz Group AG regards these lawsuits and out-of-court claims as being without merit and will defend itself against them. In December 2021, the Stuttgart Higher Regional Court initiated model case proceedings under the German Act on Model Case Proceedings in Disputes under Capital Markets Law (KapMuG) (model case proceedings). Multiple investors have used the possibility to register claims in a considerable amount with the model case proceedings in order to suspend the period of limitation. MercedesBenz Group AG remains of the view to have duly fulfilled its disclosure obligations under capital markets law and defends itself against the investors' allegations also in these model case proceedings.",

        "page_content": "If court proceedings have an unfavourable outcome for the Mercedes-Benz Group, the Group may encounter substantial financial burdens, e.g. from damages payments, remedial works or other cost-intensive measures. Court proceedings can also have an adverse effect on the reputation of the Group.\n\nFurthermore, the ability of the Mercedes-Benz Group to defend itself in the court proceedings could be impaired by the settlements of the diesel-related lawsuits in the United States and in Canada, as well as by unfavourable allegations, findings, results or developments in any of the governmental or other court proceedings discussed above.\n\n## Risks from other legal proceedings\n\nIn September 2021, individual persons associated with Deutsche Umwelthilfe e. V. (DUH) filed a lawsuit before the Stuttgart Regional Court against Mercedes-Benz AG. They claim injunctive relief, demanding that MercedesBenz AG refrain from distributing passenger cars with combustion engines after November 2030 and reduce its respective sales prior to this point in time. In the third quarter of 2022, the Regional Court of Stuttgart dismissed the claim in its entirety. The plaintiffs have appealed the decision. In the fourth quarter of 2023, the Higher Regional Court of Stuttgart upheld the decision and dismissed the plaintiffs' appeal as manifestly unfounded. The plaintiffs have lodged an appeal to the German Federal Court of Justice against the denial of leave to appeal. Mercedes-Benz AG will continue to defend itself against the plaintiffs' allegations.\n\nAs legal proceedings are fraught with a large degree of uncertainty, it is possible that after their final resolution, some of the provisions we have recognized for them could prove to be insufficient. As a result, substantial additional expenditures may arise. This also applies to legal proceedings for which the Group has seen no requirement to recognize a provision.\n\nIt cannot be ruled out that the regulatory risks and risks from legal proceedings discussed above, individually or in the aggregate, may materially adversely impact the profitability, cash flows and financial position of the Group or any of its segments.\n\nAlthough the final result of any such litigation may influence the Group's earnings and cash flows in any particular period, the Mercedes-Benz Group believes that any resulting obligations are unlikely to have a sustained effect on the Group's financial position.\n\nFurther information on legal proceedings is provided in Note 30 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Tax risks and opportunities\n\nMercedes-Benz Group AG and its subsidiaries operate in many countries worldwide and are therefore subject to numerous different statutory provisions and tax audits. Tax risks and opportunities can affect the profitability, cash flows and financial position of the Group. As of 31 December 2023, the quantification of tax risks and opportunities affecting the net profit will be disclosed for the first time in this Risk and Opportunity Report. Additionally, there are minor tax risks to the operating result.\n\nAny changes in legislation and jurisdiction, as well as different interpretations of the law by the fiscal authorities, especially in the field of cross-border transactions, may be subject to considerable uncertainty. It is therefore possible that the provisions recognized will not be sufficient, which could have negative effects on the Group's net profit and cash flows.\n\nPositive effects on the Group's net profit and cash flows are also possible as a result of retroactive legislation, future court rulings or changes in the opinions of the tax authorities.\n\nAny changes or interventions by the fiscal authorities are continuously monitored by the tax department and measures are taken if required. The monitoring, management and avoidance of tax risks is supported by a tax-compliance management system (tax CMS).",

However, there is an accounting opportunity that tax benefits currently not recognized in full may be utilized or recognized in future years and could thus also have a positive impact on the Group's net profit.\n\n## Overall assessment of the risk and opportunity situation\n\nThe overall view of the Group's risk and opportunity situation is the sum of the described individual risks and opportunities in all risk and opportunity categories.\n\nIn addition to the risks described, unforeseeable events can have a negative impact on the business activities and thus on the Mercedes-Benz Group's profitability, liquidity and capital resources, financial position and reputation, and non-financial key figures as well as on society and the environment.\n\nNo risks are recognizable - neither on the reporting date nor at the time of preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements - that either alone or in combination with other risks could endanger the continued existence of the Group.\n\n## EU taxonomy\n\nThe EU Taxonomy Regulation and the adopted delegated acts along with the supplementary interpretation documents of the European Commission contain formulations and terms that are still subject to considerable uncertainties and for which clarifications have not yet been published in all cases. Among others, this refers to the interpretation of the classification of economic activities, the do-no-significant-harm criteria and the assessment of the economic substance of financial investments. On account of the immanent risk that certain abstract legal terms can be interpreted in various ways, the conformity of the interpretation with the law is subject to uncertainty.\n\n## Components of the Combined Management Report not audited for content\n\nInsofar as the references made in the Management Report relate to parts of the Annual Report that were not included in the external audit (components outside the company and Consolidated Financial Statements and the Combined Management Report), or to the Mercedes-Benz Group website or other reports or documents, these were not part of the external audit.\n\nThe disclosures on the appropriateness and effectiveness of the internal control and risk management system in the Risk and Opportunity Report chapter, which are not part of the Management Report, were also not included in the audit of the financial statements.\n\nKey figures that were audited in order to obtain limited assurance as part of a separate assurance engagement of the sustainability report are indicated by a footnote.",

In addition, it is concerned with the audit of the financial statements and it reviews the quality, qualifications and independence of the auditor. It also discusses the appropriateness, effectiveness and operation of the risk management system, the internal control system, the internal audit system and the compliance management system. After the election of the auditor by the Annual General Meeting, the Audit Committee engages the auditor to conduct the annual audit and the auditor's review of interim financial statements. In addition, the Audit Committee agrees on the important audit issues and negotiates the audit fees with the auditor. The Audit Committee also engages the auditor to conduct the voluntary audit of the Non-Financial Declaration as part of the management report.\n\n## Equal representation\n\nIn the 2023 financial year, Olaf Koch (Chairman of the Audit Committee) and Timotheus H\u00f6ttges served as members of the Supervisory Board on the shareholder side. The persons mentioned are independent of the company and the Board of Management and have expertise in the field of accounting and the auditing of financial statements, including sustainability reporting and the auditing of such reporting. In the past financial year, the employees were represented by Ergun L\u00fcmali and also by Michael Brecht until his departure from the Supervisory Board. Roman Romanowski was elected to succeed Michael Brecht on the Audit Committee and Ergun L\u00fcmali was elected Deputy Chairman of the Audit Committee.\n\n## Meetings and participants\n\nThe Audit Committee met six times in the 2023 financial year. The Chairman of the Supervisory Board attended all meetings as a permanent guest. Other permanent participants, in compliance with the statutory requirements, were the Chairman of the Board of Management, the members of the Board of Management responsible for Finance and Controlling and for Integrity, Governance & Sustainability, and the\n\nrepresentatives of the auditor. The heads of specialist departments such as Accounting, Internal Audit, Compliance and Legal also provided information on individual items on the agenda. Regular executive sessions also took place with the auditor without the presence of the Board of Management.\n\nParticularly in preparation for upcoming meetings, the Chairman of the Audit Committee held regular discussions with the auditor as well as individual discussions, for example with the aforementioned members of the Board of Management, the Head of Internal Auditing, the Head of Compliance, the Head of Legal Affairs and, if required, with the heads of other specialist departments.\n\n## Information for the Supervisory Board\n\nThe Chairman of the Audit Committee informed the Supervisory Board in each of its subsequent meetings of the activities of the Committee as well as the content of the meetings and discussions.",

After careful review, the Committee took note of and approved the figures presented, determined that there were no objections to the proposed publication and recommended that the Supervisory Board, which met afterwards, endorse this view. The preliminary key figures and the preliminary proposal for the appropriation of profits were published at the annual press conference on 17 February 2023. During the aforementioned meeting, the Committee also discussed the results of the internally conducted quality analysis of the audit of the financial statements. In addition, the Committee dealt with the report on the total fees paid to the auditor for audit and non-audit services in the 2022 financial year (including the non-audit fee cap) and set the approval framework for the engagement of the auditor for non-audit services for the period from 1 February 2023 to 31 December 2023. Subject to the election resolution of the Annual General Meeting, the Committee also discussed the proposal for the fee agreement to be made with the auditor for the 2023 financial year. In addition, the Audit Committee discussed the 2023 annual audit plan of the Internal Audit Department and the reports issued by the Compliance and Legal departments. Finally, the Committee was informed about the current financial status, volumes and prices of the vehicle clusters in the current and future Mercedes-Benz Cars portfolio.\n\nIn its meeting on 13 March 2023, the Committee reviewed and discussed in detail the Annual Financial Statements, the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Combined Management Report, including the Non-Financial Declaration for Mercedes-Benz Group AG and the Group for the 2022 financial year, the Remuneration report, the Declaration on Corporate Governance and the proposal for the appropriation of profits, all of which were issued with an unqualified audit opinion by the auditor. The representatives of the auditor reported on the results of the audit and in particular addressed the key audit matters and the relevant audit procedures, including the conclusions drawn, and were available to answer additional questions and provide information. The audit opinions on the company and Consolidated Financial Statements (including the key audit matters in the audit opinions) and on the accounting-related internal control system, as well as significant accounting matters, were discussed together with the auditor. Furthermore, the Audit Committee discussed the effectiveness of the internal control and risk management system.\n\nAfter intensive review and discussion, the Audit Committee recommended that the Supervisory Board adopt the prepared financial statements, the Combined Management Report including the Non-Financial Declaration, the Remuneration report, the Declaration on Corporate Governance and the proposal of the Board of Management for the payment of a dividend of \u20ac5.20 per dividend-bearing no-par-value share. The Audit Committee also adopted the Report of the Audit Committee on the 2022 financial year.\n\nIn this meeting, the Audit Committee also resolved to recommend to the Supervisory Board, and subsequently to the Annual General Meeting, that KPMG AG Wirtschaftspr\u00fcfungsgesellschaft be appointed to audit the financial statements and the Consolidated Financial Statements, and to serve as the auditor for the review of interim financial reports for the 2023 financial year. The discussion of the quality of the audit and the results of the independence review, which did not reveal any indications of bias or threats to independence, were taken into account.\n\nDuring 2023, the Audit Committee discussed the interim financial reports and the results of the audit review with the Board of Management and the auditor in the quarterly meetings prior to their publication. In addition, the Committee received reports from the Internal Audit, Compliance and Legal departments. The Board of Management also regularly reported to the Committee on the current status of material legal proceedings, including antitrust and diesel emissions-related proceedings. In addition, the Audit Committee received regular reports on possible violations of rules, which employees and external parties reported to the BPO (Business & People Protection Office) whistle-blowing system.\n\nIn April 2023, the Committee initially considered the interim financial report for the first quarter of 2023. The Audit Committee then also received reports from the Internal Audit and Legal departments and from the Compliance unit. The report submitted by the Internal Audit department also included an update on",

In addition, it received reporting on the further development of the internal control system. Subjects presented with respect to the Compliance Management System included digitalization initiatives with the possible future use of artificial intelligence. The report on the further measures implementing the new ESG and sustainability reporting requirements and the establishment of a uniform business performance management system for sustainability and ESG were a focal point of the meeting. In addition, the Audit Committee received an exhaustive report from the tax department. Information was provided on the further development of the tax compliance management system and new regulatory requirements related to ESG and sustainability. Another topic of the meeting was a discussion of the planning of the audit of the financial statements, including the main audit areas for the 2023 financial year. In this context, the committee also considered the quality of the audit of the financial statements and the status of the transition in connection with the upcoming rotation of the auditor. Finally, the Audit Committee received reporting on current accounting topics.\n\nAt its meeting in July 2023, the Committee dealt with the results of the second quarter of 2023 and the risk report. Furthermore, the Committee received the quarterly reports from the Compliance, Internal Audit and Legal departments. These reports contained information on, among other things, an external quality assessment that had been performed in accordance with the standards of the Institute of Internal Auditors and in which Internal Audit was able to achieve an outstanding result. In addition, the Audit Committee discussed the annual report of the Group Data Protection Officer with the Board of Management. The Committee also used audit quality indicators to analyse the quality of the audits. The agenda also included the discussion of a report on the management of currency risks.\n\nIn October 2023, the Committee dealt with the interim financial report for the third quarter of 2023 and the risk report. Furthermore, the Committee carried out the annual review of the approved non-audit services of the auditor and dealt with the quarterly reports from the Compliance, Internal Audit and Legal departments. Here, the Audit Committee received extensive information on social compliance activities, and in particular on human rights due diligence processes, in connection with the Act on Corporate Due Diligence Obligations in Supply Chains (German Supply Chain Act - LkSG). It also once again received reports on the status of the transition in connection with the upcoming rotation of the auditor.\n\n## Company and Consolidated Financial Statements for 2023\n\nIn its meeting on 21 February 2024, the Audit Committee discussed the preliminary key figures of the company and the Consolidated Financial Statements for 2023 as well as the preliminary proposal of the Board of Management on the appropriation of profits. After careful review, the Committee took note of and approved the figures presented, determined that there were no objections to the proposed publication and recommended that the Supervisory Board, which met afterwards, endorse this view. The preliminary key figures and the preliminary proposal for the appropriation of profits were published at the annual press conference on 22 February 2024.\n\nIn March 2024, the Committee reviewed and discussed in detail the Annual Financial Statements, the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Combined Management Report, including the Non-Financial Declaration for Mercedes-Benz Group AG and the Group for the 2023 financial year, the Remuneration report, the Declaration on Corporate Governance and the proposal for the appropriation of profits. The representatives of the auditor reported on the results of the audit and in particular addressed the key audit matters and the relevant audit procedures, including the conclusions drawn, and were available to answer additional questions and provide information.

Pursuant to Section 317 Subsection 2 Sentence 6 HGB, the review of the Declaration on Corporate Governance by the auditor is to be limited to whether the legally required statements were made.\n\nThis Declaration on Corporate Governance, as well as the most recent version of the Declaration of Compliance pursuant to Section 161 of the German Stock Corporation Act on the German Corporate Governance Code, is, in addition to the no longer current declarations of the past five years, available on the website of the company w group.mercedes-benz.com/dcg.\n\nDeclaration of the Board of Management and Supervisory Board of Mercedes-Benz Group AG on the Compliance with the German Corporate Governance Code according to Section 161 of the German Stock Corporation Act\n\nMercedes-Benz Group AG maintains compliance with the recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code in the Code version, dated April 28, 2022 ('Code'), published by the Federal Ministry of Justice and Consumer Protection in the official section of the German Federal Gazette on June 27, 2022, with the exception of Recommendations C.4 and C.5 (Maximum number of Supervisory Board mandates) and will also continue to observe the recommendations with the aforesaid deviations in the future. Since the submission of the last Compliance Declaration in December 2022, Mercedes-Benz Group AG has maintained compliance with the recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code also with the aforesaid deviations.\n\n## Maximum number of Supervisory Board mandates (C. 4 and C. 5)\n\nAccording to Recommendation C.4, Supervisory Board members who are not members of any management\n\nboard of a listed company shall not accept more than a total of five Supervisory Board mandates in non-group listed companies or comparable functions, whereby a mandate as Supervisory Board Chair counts twice. According to Recommendation C.5, members of the Management Board of listed companies shall not have a total of more than two Supervisory Board mandates in non-group listed companies or comparable functions, and shall not accept the Chair of a Supervisory Board in a non-group listed company. Rather than setting a strict amount limit, it is more appropriate to assess on a case-by-case basis whether the number of mandates held by members of the Management Boards and Supervisory Boards at non-group listed companies or comparable functions appears to be appropriate, in particular because it is not always possible to clearly define the mandates that should be taken into consideration. Moreover, the individual workload expected as a result of the total number of mandates held does not necessarily increase in proportion to their number.\n\nStuttgart, December 2023\n\nFor the Supervisory Board\n\nFor the Board of Management\n\nDr Bernd Pischetsrieder Chairman\n\nOla K\u00e4llenius Chairman",

For the MercedesBenz Group's expectations of its business partners, please also see w group.mercedes-benz.com/company/compliance/business-partners.html.\n\n## Advisory Board for Integrity and Sustainability\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz Group established an Advisory Board for Integrity and Sustainability. The board's members are independent external experts in the fields of environmental and social policy, transport and mobility development, and human rights and ethics and provide the Mercedes-Benz Group with constructive and critical support with issues relating to integrity, sustainability and corporate responsibility. The Advisory Board convenes several times a year in meetings that are chaired by the member of the Board of Management responsible for Integrity, Governance & Sustainability. One of these annual meetings specifically serves to exchange information with other members of the Board of Management and members of the Supervisory Board. Additionally, a regular exchange of information and opinions between the Advisory Board and company managers and employees takes place in other meetings devoted to specific topics. Such meetings also include working groups that focus on integrity and employees, climate change mitigation and resource conservation.

In identifying sustainability-related risks and opportunities, Mercedes-Benz Group AG is guided by the topics identified by the materiality assessment and thus includes the areas of action of the sustainable business strategy, for which concrete goals have been assigned. The materiality assessment was concluded in summer 2022 and after a review of the areas of action remains valid for the year 2023. Sustainability-related data are also systematically recorded and social and environmental impacts of the company's activities are identified and assessed as part of the materiality assessment and thematic risk assessments, for example in life cycle assessments along the entire life cycle of vehicles or in the Human Rights Respect System.",

Further information on risk management can be found in the Risk and Opportunity Report in the Combined Management Report 2023.\n\nIn addition to the accounting-related internal control system, the internal control system also includes in particular the Compliance Management System and other similar systems or frameworks such as the Human Rights Respect System, as well as an independent assessment of the structure and processes of the internal control system by Internal Auditing. Further explanations of the internal control system are available in the Risk and Opportunity Report in the Combined Management Report 2023.\n\nThe aim of the Compliance Management System (CMS) is to promote compliance with legislation and policies within the company and among its employees, to prevent misconduct and to systematically minimize compliance risks on the basis of the culture of integrity.

The declaration also specifies which other services were provided to the Group in the previous year and to what extent and which ones have contractually been stipulated for the following year.\n\nThe auditor informs the Supervisory Board without delay of any and all findings and occurrences of significance for the duties of the Supervisory Board that come to the attention of the auditor during the performance of the audit.

It has established a comprehensive Compliance\n\nManagement System geared to the risk situation of the company, the basic features of which are presented in the Non-Financial Declaration chapter of the 2023 Annual Report. The components of the Compliance Management System also include the BPO (Business & People Protection Office) whistleblowing system, which gives employees and external whistleblowers worldwide the opportunity to report violations of the rules.\n\nThe Board of Management compiles the interim financial reports of the company, the Annual Financial Statements of Mercedes-Benz Group AG, the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Combined Management Report with Non-Financial Declaration of the company and the Group.

The key components of this programme include ESG (environmental, social and governance) and sustainability-related thematic blocks. In the reporting period, for example, the company held information events on sustainable corporate governance and sustainability reporting as well as on the Mercedes-Benz operating system MB.OS. Both internal and external experts were involved in these events. In addition, new members of the Supervisory Board have the opportunity to meet the members of the Board of Management and senior executives with specialist responsibility in a specifically designated onboarding programme for a bilateral exchange on fundamental and current topics in respect of the relevant areas of the Board of Management, thus gaining an overview of the topics relevant to the company and of the governance structure.\n\nThe Supervisory Board supervises and advises the Board of Management in the management of the business.

The Supervisory Board has reserved the right of approval for transactions of fundamental importance.\n\nThe Supervisory Board's monitoring and advisory activities also relate to sustainability issues associated with the ESG dimensions (environmental, social and governance factors). At regular intervals, the Supervisory Board obtains reports from the Board of Management on the status of implementation of the sustainable corporate strategy and also examines the risks and opportunities for the company that result from social and environmental factors and, increasingly, the ecological and social effects of the company's business activities.

Conflicts of interest and the manner in which they are dealt with are disclosed in the Report of the Supervisory Board.\n\nThe Supervisory Board regularly evaluates how effectively it and its committees fulfil their tasks. In the reporting period, a comprehensive self-assessment of the Supervisory Board and its committees took place with the involvement of an external consultant on the basis of an extensive questionnaire and additional interviews carried out. The Board of Management's perspective was also included in this assessment. The Supervisory Board addressed the results in detail in its meeting on February 21 st , 2024. The results confirm very good, professional cooperation characterised by a high degree of trust within the Supervisory Board and its committees as well as with the Board of Management. In addition, the results attest to the very efficient organisation and holding of meetings as well as appropriate reporting by the Board of Management. There was no fundamental need for change. Some individual ideas and recommendations were discussed. Additionally, a further internal and comprehensive evaluation took place during the reporting period in the Audit Committee. This was done on the basis of a comprehensive questionnaire without external support.\n\nAs of 31 December 2023, in addition to the Mediation Committee to be established by law, there are four other committees of the Supervisory Board that perform the tasks assigned to them in the name of and on behalf of the Supervisory Board as a whole, to the extent permitted by law. The relevant committee\n\nchairpersons shall report on the work of the committees to the plenary meeting of the Supervisory Board at the latest at the next meeting of the Supervisory Board following the committee meeting.

They are available on the internet at w group.mercedes-benz.com/company/corporate-governance.\n\n## Presidential Committee\n\nThe Presidential Committee consists of the Chairman of the Supervisory Board, the Deputy Chairman of the Supervisory Board, and two other members elected by the Supervisory Board. As of 31 December 2023, the Presidential Committee consisted of Dr Bernd Pischetsrieder (Chairman), Ergun L\u00fcmali (Deputy Chairman), Ben van Beurden and Roman Zitzelsberger.\n\nThe Presidential Committee makes recommendations to the Supervisory Board for the appointment of members to the Board of Management, in consideration of the overall profile of requirements defined by the Supervisory Board with the diversity concept, including the requirements for the proportion of women on the Board of Management. It submits proposals to the Supervisory Board for the structure of the remuneration system for the Board of Management and for the appropriate individual total remuneration of the individual members of the Board of Management. The Presidential Committee is responsible for the contractual matters of the members of the Board of Management and decides on the granting of approval for ancillary activities of members of the Board of Management outside the Group.\n\nIn addition, the Presidential Committee advises and decides on corporate governance issues, on which it also makes recommendations to the Supervisory Board. It supports and advises the Chairman of the Supervisory Board and his Deputy and prepares the meetings of the Supervisory Board within the scope of its responsibilities.\n\n## Nomination Committee\n\nThe Nomination Committee consists of the Chairman of the Supervisory Board and two other members elected by the shareholder representatives in the Supervisory Board by a majority of the votes cast. As of 31 December 2023, they are Dr Bernd Pischetsrieder (Chairman of the Nomination Committee), Dr Martin Bruderm\u00fcller and Ben van Beurden. The Nomination Committee is the only committee of the Supervisory Board composed exclusively of shareholder representatives. It makes recommendations to the Supervisory Board for proposals to the General Meeting for the election of shareholder representatives on the Supervisory Board. In this respect, it takes the statutory requirements for the participation of women into account and strives to fulfil the overall profile of requirements for the Supervisory Board as a whole.\n\n## Audit Committee\n\nThe Audit Committee consists of four members elected by the Supervisory Board by a majority of the votes cast. As of 31 December 2023, they are the shareholder representatives Olaf Koch (Chairman of the Audit Committee) and Timotheus H\u00f6ttges as well as the employee representatives Ergun L\u00fcmali and Roman Romanowski.",

The following information therefore relates to the Board of Management of Mercedes-Benz Group AG, two management levels of Mercedes-Benz Group AG below its Board of Management, and the Supervisory Board of Mercedes-Benz Group AG.\n\nBy resolution of 3 December 2020, the Supervisory Board of Mercedes-Benz Group AG set a target for the proportion of women on the Board of Management of at least 25% by 31 December 2025. Since August 2022, a legally mandated minimum participation requirement must be complied with when appointing members of the board of management. This requirement stipulates that at least one woman and at least one man must be a member of the board of management in a listed company with co-determination and equal representation and more than three members on the board of management. Companies that are subject to the minimum proportion requirement are no longer obliged to set a target quota for the proportion of women on the board of management. Nevertheless, within the framework of the\n\noverall requirements profile for appointments to the Board of Management, the Supervisory Board has decided to go beyond the stipulations of the minimum proportion requirement and maintain the target quota for the proportion of women on the Board of Management that was set in 2020. As at 31 December 2023, three of the eight members of the Board of Management are women: Renata Jungo Br\u00fcngger, Sabine Kohleisen and Britta Seeger. The proportion of women on the Board of Management is now 37.5%, which means it exceeds the target that was set.\n\nBy a resolution dated 25 November 2020, the Board of Management set a 11.8% share of women at the first (two women of a total of 17 executives) and 22.5% at the second level of management of Mercedes-Benz Group AG (16 women of a total of 71 executives) below the Board of Management at the time of the resolution and a target for the proportion of women of at least 20% for the first and of at least 25% for the second level of the Mercedes-Benz Group AG below the Board of Management by 31 December 2025. As of 31 December 2023, the first level of management of Mercedes-Benz Group AG below the Board of Management consists of 13 executives, of whom 3 are women, corresponding to a percentage of women of 23%. At the second level of management of Mercedes-Benz Group AG below the Board of Management, as of 31 December 2023, 17 out of a total of 50 executives are women, corresponding to 34%.\n\nThe change in the total number of executives at the various management levels of Mercedes-Benz Group AG\n\nbetween 25 November 2020 and 31 December 2023 is mainly due to the spin-off and hive-down of the Daimler commercial vehicles business that has meanwhile been carried out and the associated transfers to Daimler Truck.\n\nBased on the assumption of a total of 13 executives at management level 1 of Mercedes-Benz Group AG as of 31 December 2025, the set target quota of at least 20% results in a target of 3 women for this level. Based on the assumption of a total of 50 executives at management level 2 of Mercedes-Benz Group AG as of 31 December 2025, the set target quota of 25% results in a target of 13 women for this level.\n\nThe supervisory boards of listed companies subject to co-determination and equal representation of shareholders and employees on the supervisory board must be composed of at least 30% women and at least 30% men. The quota is to be met by the Supervisory Board as a whole. If the representatives of the shareholders or the representatives of the employees object to the Chairman of the Supervisory Board prior to the election, then the minimum share for this election shall be fulfilled separately by the shareholders and the employees. At the Supervisory Board meeting on 27 April 2022, the shareholder representatives objected to the overall fulfilment with regard to the election to the Supervisory Board of employee representatives whose term of office began at the end of the Annual General Meeting on 3 May 2023. There was no objection to the overall fulfilment with regard to the election of a shareholder",

At that point of time, on the employee side, Nadine Boguslawski, Gabriela Neher and Monika Tielsch also make up 30% women and the remaining 70% are men. If she is elected as a shareholder representative by the Annual General Meeting 2024, the membership of Dr. Doris H\u00f6pke on the Supervisory Board will increase the proportion of women on the shareholder side to 40%.\n\nThe statutory quota for women for the Supervisory Board thus remains fulfilled.\n\nIn addition to Mercedes-Benz Group AG itself, other Group companies are subject to co-determination and have set their own targets for the proportion of women on their respective Supervisory Boards and Boards of Management, and at the two levels below the Board of Management, as well as a deadline for achieving these targets, and have published them in accordance with the statutory requirements.\n\n## Overall profiles of requirements for the composition of the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board\n\nWith regard to the composition of the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board, Mercedes-Benz Group AG considers competence profiles and diversity concepts with regard to aspects such as age and gender. The Supervisory Board has combined these profiles and concepts in the overall profiles of requirements for the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board described below. The profiles of requirements are reviewed annually and also serve as a basis for longterm succession planning.\n\n## Board of Management\n\nThe objective of the profile of requirements for the Board of Management is to ensure that the Board of Management has excellent leadership skills and that its composition is as diverse and complementary as possible. The Board of Management as a whole shall possess the knowledge, skills and experience necessary for the proper performance of its duties and at the same time embody the company's management philosophy on the basis of the various personal backgrounds and skills of its members. The key factor for the decision on filling a specific board position is always the interest of the company, taking any and all circumstances of the individual case into account.\n\nThe profile of requirements for the Board of Management remained the same in the reporting period as in the previous year and included the following aspects:\n\n- -   The members of the Board of Management shall have diverse educational and professional backgrounds , preferably with at least two members with a technical background. As of 31 December 2023, the Board of Management includes two graduate engineers, Markus Sch\u00e4fer and Dr J\u00f6rg Burzer. Ola K\u00e4llenius has demonstrated his technical expertise on a sustained basis since taking over the Group Research & Mercedes-Benz Cars Development department on 1 January 2017.\n- -   On 3 December 2020, the Supervisory Board set a target for the proportion of women on the Board of Management of at least 25% by 31 December 2025. In August 2022, the previous statutory obligation to set a target quota for the proportion of women was replaced by a statutory minimum participation requirement of one woman (and one man) for boards of management consisting of more than three persons at listed companies with co-determination and equal representation. Nevertheless, within the framework of the overall requirements profile for appointments to the Board of Management, the Supervisory Board has decided to go beyond the stipulations of the minimum proportion requirement and maintain the target quota for the proportion of women on the Board of Management that was set in 2020. As of 31 December 2023, three of the eight members of the Board of Management are women: Renata Jungo",

When determining this age limit, the Supervisory Board deliberately opted for a flexible benchmark in order to preserve the necessary leeway for appropriate decisions in individual cases. With the exception of Renata Jungo Br\u00fcngger, all members of the Board of Management fall below this standard age limit as of 31 December 2023.\n- -   In addition, attention shall be paid to a sufficient generational mix among the members of the Board of Management; if possible, at least three members of the Board of Management shall be 57 years of age or younger at the beginning of the relevant term of office. As of 31 December 2023, this applies to, among others, Ola K\u00e4llenius, Britta Seeger and Dr J\u00f6rg Burzer.\n- -   In the composition of the Board of Management, attention shall also be paid to internationality in the sense of different cultural backgrounds or international experience through several years of stays abroad; if possible, at least one member of the Board of Management shall be of international origin. Notwithstanding the many years of international\n\nexperience of the vast majority of the members of the Board of Management, this goal had already been achieved by 31 December 2023, simply because of the international origins of Ola K\u00e4llenius and Renata Jungo Br\u00fcngger and the focus of Hubertus Troska's activities in China.\n\n- -   As a rule, and subject to disclosure of a deviation in the annual Declaration of Compliance with the German Corporate Governance Code, members of the Board of Management shall not hold more than two mandates on supervisory boards in non-Group listed companies or comparable functions and shall not chair a supervisory board of a non-Group listed company. For the purpose of the profile of requirements, mandates on supervisory boards in joint ventures, the performance of which is part of the departmental responsibility of a member of the Board of Management, are not considered to be comparable functions.\n\nOf the non-Group memberships of Supervisory Boards and other supervisory bodies held by Hubertus Troska, only BAIC Motor Corporation Ltd. is listed on the stock exchange. With the exception of the mandate at Beijing Foton Daimler Automotive Co., Ltd., his other mandates outside the Group are mandates in non-listed joint ventures within his departmental responsibility. In the opinion of the Supervisory Board, these mandates, as well as the mandate at Beijing Foton Daimler Automotive Co., Ltd., which is part of the Daimler Truck Group, do not pose any requirements comparable to\n\nmandates on supervisory boards of listed companies outside the Group in terms of the requirements profile. The same applies to the non-Group mandates of Markus Sch\u00e4fer.\n\nOf the non-Group memberships of supervisory boards and other supervisory bodies held by Britta Seeger, only Deutsche Lufthansa AG is listed on the stock exchange. In the opinion of the Supervisory Board, the other mandates outside the Group are mandates within the scope of her departmental responsibilities that, in terms of the profile of requirements, do not pose any demands comparable to a mandate on the supervisory board of a listed company outside the Group.\n\nRenata Jungo Br\u00fcngger is a member of the Supervisory Board of the listed company M\u00fcnchener R\u00fcckversicherungs-Gesellschaft Aktiengesellschaft and Harald Wilhelm is a member of the Supervisory Board of BAIC Motor Corporation Ltd, which is also listed on the stock exchange. In addition, both are represented on the Supervisory Board of the nongroup listed Daimler Truck Holding AG as well as on the Supervisory Board of the non-listed Daimler Truck AG, a wholly owned subsidiary of Daimler Truck Holding AG. The shareholder representatives on the Supervisory Boards of Daimler Truck Holding AG and Daimler Truck AG are identical. Against this background, in the opinion of the Supervisory Board, membership of the Supervisory Board of Daimler Truck AG does not impose any additional requirements comparable to the mandate at Daimler Truck",

A deviation from the recommendation of the German Corporate Governance Code that members of boards of management of listed companies should not hold more than two mandates on supervisory boards in non-group listed companies or comparable functions and should not chair a supervisory board is stated and justified in the 2023 Declaration of Compliance, notwithstanding the assessments of the Supervisory Board for the purposes of the profile of requirements.\n\nThe criteria of the profile of requirements shall be taken into account when filling positions on the Board of Management. The Presidential Committee draws up a short-list of available candidates on the basis of a target profile, taking into account the specific qualification requirements and the requirements profile. It conducts interviews with these candidates, and it then submits a candidate proposal to the Supervisory Board together with the reasons for its recommendation for the decision-making. The decisive factor is always the interest of the company, in consideration of any and all circumstances of the individual case.\n\nIn the view of the Supervisory Board, fundamental individual suitability criteria for a position on the Board of Management are, in particular, personality, integrity, convincing leadership qualities, professional qualifications for the division to be taken over, past performance, knowledge of the company, and the ability to adapt business models and processes in a changing world.\n\nTogether with the Board of Management, the Supervisory Board also ensures long-term succession planning for the Board of Management, with due consideration of the profile of requirements and the circumstances of the individual case. The Presidential Committee of the Supervisory Board regularly discusses talents and exceptional leaders of the company. The contract terms and renewal options of current members of the Board of Management are discussed, as well as possible successors. On the basis of a potential analysis and in consideration of the criteria of the profile of requirements, executives from the management level below the Board of Management as well as special high potentials are assessed and the next development steps are discussed and determined together with the Board of Management. The process of succession planning also includes regular reporting by the Board of Management on the proportion and development of female managers, especially at the first and second management levels below the Board of Management. The Board of Management is responsible for proposing a sufficient number of suitable candidates to the Supervisory Board. Mercedes-Benz Group AG aims to predominantly fill positions on the Board of Management with managers developed within the company. Nevertheless, potential external candidates are also evaluated and included in the selection process on a case-by-case basis, with the support of external recruitment consultancy firms.\n\n## Supervisory Board\n\nThe Supervisory Board as a whole must be familiar with the industry in which the company operates.\n\nThe aim of the profile of requirements for the Supervisory Board in its entirety is also to ensure that the composition of the Supervisory Board is as diverse and complementary as possible. The Supervisory Board shall, as a whole, understand the business model of the company and possess the knowledge, skills and experience - including expertise on the sustainability issues that are important for the company - necessary to properly provide qualified supervision and advice to the Board of Management.\n\nOverall, the members of the Supervisory Board shall complement one another in terms of their expertise and professional experience in such a way that the Board as a whole can draw on the broadest possible pool of experience and diverse specialist knowledge. Furthermore, the Supervisory Board considers the diversity of its members in terms of age, gender, internationality and other personal characteristics as an important prerequisite for an effective working relationship. The decision of the Supervisory Board on an election proposal to the General Meeting shall always be based on the interests of the company, taking any and all circumstances of the individual case into account.\n\nThe profile of requirements for the Supervisory Board includes the following aspects:\n\n## -Standard limit of membership duration\n\nAs a rule, only candidates who have not already been members of the Supervisory Board for 12 years at the time of their (re-)election shall be proposed for election to the Supervisory Board for a full term of office.",

The quota is to be met by the Supervisory Board as a whole, unless the representatives of the shareholders or the representatives of the employees object to the overall fulfilment. If such an objection is made, then the minimum proportion for the next election in the given case is to be fulfilled separately by the shareholder side and the employee side. As of 31 December 2023, there are three women on both the side of the shareholders and the side of the employees. This puts the proportion of women on the shareholder side, the employee side and for the Supervisory Board as a whole at 30% If she is elected by the Annual General Meeting 2024, the membership of Dr. Doris H\u00f6pke on the Supervisory Board will increase the proportion of women on the shareholder side to 40%. At the Supervisory Board meeting on 27 April 2022, the shareholder representatives objected to the overall fulfilment with regard to the election to the Supervisory Board of employee representatives whose term of office began at the end of the Annual General Meeting on 3 May 2023. There was no objection to the overall fulfilment with regard to the election of a shareholder representative by the Annual General Meeting on 3 May 2023.

All shareholder representatives in office on 31 December 2023 have international experience. Moreover, the target has already been exceeded simply because of the international background of six shareholder representatives - Ben van Beurden, Liz Centoni, Dame Polly Courtice, Marco Gobbetti, Stefan Pierer and Professor Dr Helene Svahn - who together account for 60% of the shareholder representatives.\n- -Educational and professional background: The members of the Supervisory Board should have different educational and professional backgrounds. As of 31 December 2023, the members of the\n\nSupervisory Board display a broad range of educational and professional backgrounds. Dr Bernd Pischetsrieder, Ben van Beurden, Dr Martin Bruderm\u00fcller, Liz Centoni, Stefan Pierer, Prof. Dr Helene Svahn, Dr Frank Weber and Roman Zitzelsberger have university degrees in mechanical engineering, chemistry, business and energy management, biotechnology and/or electrical engineering. Other employee representatives have completed relevant professional training. Several members of the Supervisory Board have university degrees in economics, including Timotheus H\u00f6ttges and Olaf Koch on the shareholder side and Michael Bettag on the employee side. The diverse range of educational and professional backgrounds is rounded out on the shareholder side by Dame Polly Courtice and Marco Gobbetti, who are proven experts in the areas of sustainability and the luxury goods segment, respectively, while the employee side of the Supervisory Board includes a lawyer, a social economist and a production mechanic.\n\n## -Formal suitability\n\n- -Independence: In order to ensure independent advice to and supervision of the Board of Management by the Supervisory Board, more than half of the shareholder representatives on the Supervisory Board shall be independent of the company and the Board of Management, subject to the disclosure of a deviation from the corresponding recommendation of the German Corporate Governance Code in the Declaration of Compliance pursuant to Section 161 of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG).",

        "page_content": "A shareholder representative on the Supervisory Board shall be independent of the company and its Board of Management if he or she has no personal or business relationship with the company or its Board of Management that could give rise to a material and not merely temporary conflict of interests. The assessment of independence is incumbent on the shareholder representatives on the Supervisory Board themselves. In this respect, four indicators must be taken into account that may point to a lack of independence: membership of the Board of Management within the last two years prior to the appointment as a member of the Supervisory Board; a significant business relationship with the company or a company dependent on it, e.g. as a customer, supplier, lender or consultant; a close family relationship to a member of the Board of Management; membership of the Supervisory Board for more than twelve years (all criteria relate to both the members of the Supervisory Board and their close family members). However, the shareholder side is expressly at liberty to regard the member of the Supervisory Board in question as independent if one or even several negative indicators are fulfilled - however, this assessment should then be substantiated in the Declaration on Corporate Governance.\n\nOn the basis of the information known to the Supervisory Board, the shareholder representatives are of the opinion that there are no specific indications of relevant personal or business relationships or circumstances, in particular with regard to the\n\ncompany, members of the Board of Management or other members of the Supervisory Board, that could constitute a material and not merely temporary conflict of interests and therefore argue against the independence of any member of the Supervisory Board on the shareholder side. During the reporting period, the shareholder representatives Dr Martin Bruderm\u00fcller, Liz Centoni, and Timotheus H\u00f6ttges in particular did not have any such material business relationship with Mercedes-Benz Group AG or any company dependent on Mercedes-Benz Group AG (e.g. as a supplier, customer, lender or consultant) in a responsible function of a company outside the Group. The same applies - also in view of the information provided in the chapter Consolidated Financial Statements in the note Related party disclosures - to Stefan Pierer in his role as a shareholder and board member of companies in the Pierer and Leoni Groups. No former member of the Board of Management was a member of the Supervisory Board during the reporting period. No member of the Supervisory Board holds board functions or performs advisory tasks for significant competitors.\n\nNo other mandates formerly held by Dr Bernd Pischetsrieder could be seen during the reporting period as constituting a material and not merely temporary conflict of interest.\n\nAs a result, according to the assessment of the shareholders' side, at 31 December 2023, all shareholder representatives on the Supervisory Board\n\nwere to be deemed independent, namely Dr Bernd Pischetsrieder, Ben van Beurden, Dr Martin Bruderm\u00fcller, Liz Centoni, Dame Polly Courtice, Marco Gobbetti, Timotheus H\u00f6ttges, Olaf Koch, Stefan Pierer and Professor Dr Helene Svahn.\n\n- -Standard age limit: As a rule, only candidates who are not older than 72 years at the time of their (re-) election shall be proposed for election to the Supervisory Board for a full term of office. Upon the establishment of this age limit, the Supervisory Board deliberately decided against a rigid maximum age limit and in favour of a flexible standard limit that preserves the necessary leeway for an appropriate assessment of the circumstances of the individual case, that defines the group of potential candidates in a sufficiently broad manner, and that also allows for re-election. None of the members of the Supervisory Board in office on 31 December 2023 exceeded the standard age limit at the time of their election.\n\n## -Expertise and experience\n\n- -Two finance experts: At least one member of the Audit Committee must have expertise in the field of accounting and at least one other member must have expertise in the audit of financial statements. Expertise in the field of accounting should involve specialized knowledge of and experience with the use of accounting principles and internal control and risk management systems, while expertise in relation to the audit of financial statements must also involve specialized knowledge of and",

In addition, specialized knowledge of and experience with financial reporting and financial statement auditing shall include sustainability reporting and the audit of sustainability reports. On the shareholder side, the Audit Committee has two finance experts as members - Olaf Koch and Timotheus H\u00f6ttges - whose current or past relevant duties at (listed) companies, as well as continuing education activities, ensure they have specialized knowledge of and experience with accounting and the audit of financial statements. The same applies to their specialized knowledge of and experience with sustainability reporting and the audit of sustainability reports. Further details on the expertise of the two finance experts can be found in the information on the composition and working method of the Audit Committee in this Declaration on Corporate Governance.\n\n- -Other special areas of expertise: The Supervisory Board shall, as a whole, possess expertise and experience in areas of particular relevance to the company. At least three members of the Supervisory Board shall bring knowledge and experience in each of the following areas:\n- -  Finance (e.g. accounting, controlling, risk management, auditing, M&A)\n- -  Strategy\n- -  Digitalization/IT (e.g. software, processes, data security)\n- -  Transformation (e.g. products, working models)\n\n- -  Human resources (e.g. human resources management, employee issues, world of work)\n- -  Sustainability/ESG (in particular: the environment - green production and logistics, climate and decarbonization strategy; social - people plan, sustainable supply chains; governance sustainable corporate governance, sustainable finance)\n- -  Industry (e.g. production, procurement)\n- -  Innovation, research and development, technology\n- -  Sales/brands\n- -  Capital markets\n\nThe specification examples in the parentheses for the areas shown above are not complete; in addition, expertise does not have to be demonstrated for every specified item in the parentheses for each area.\n\nOn the basis of the table Qualification matrix of the Supervisory Board members, the Supervisory Board as a whole in its current composition meets the defined requirements pertaining to its expertise/ experience. More than three members of the Supervisory Board have relevant knowledge and/or experience in each of the areas of expertise shown above.

In terms of the corporate strategy that is geared towards sustainability and the luxury vehicle segment, the ESG expertise of Dame Polly Courtice, as well as Marco Gobbetti's experience in the luxury-goods industry, deserve special mention. In addition, Roman Zitzelsberger and Ergun L\u00fcmali in particular have extensive experience with strategy issues - Roman Zitzelsberger due to the mandates he has held in various supervisory boards and Ergun L\u00fcmali due to the many years he has served on the company's Supervisory Board.\n\nIn the area of digitalization/IT, Liz Centoni and Timotheus H\u00f6ttges, among others, are able to contribute expertise and experience gained through their professional activities at Cisco and Deutsche Telekom, respectively. The same can be said for Monika Tielsch due to her activity as a Works Council member in the R&D unit, where the MB.OS operating system is being developed.\n\nDr Martin Bruderm\u00fcller and Ben van Beurden in particular have extensive expertise in the area of",

Dr Frank Weber also possesses expertise in the area of human resources, as he has served for many years as Chairman of the Management Representative Committee at the Mercedes-Benz Group. The knowledge and experience of the IG Metall (German Metalworkers' Union) representatives Nadine Boguslawski, Roman Romanowski and Roman Zitzelsberger in the area of human resources has also proved valuable for the work conducted by the Supervisory Board.\n\nIn the area of sustainability/ESG, Dame Polly Courtice contributes the expertise she has gained in ESG matters as a result of having served for many years as Director of the University of Cambridge Institute for Sustainability Leadership. Dr Martin Bruderm\u00fcller, Ben van Beurden and Timotheus H\u00f6ttges in particular contribute to the Supervisory\n\nBoard their knowledge of and experience with environmental (E) issues. All of them deal or dealt extensively with sustainability issues (in particular those relating to climate change mitigation and decarbonization) at the companies in which they serve or served as chairman of the board of management.

With regard to governance (G), Olaf Koch and Roman Romanowski contribute to the Supervisory Board the expertise they have gained throughout their professional careers.\n\nIn the area of industry, Dr Bernd Pischetsrieder in particular has extensive sector-specific knowledge that he has gained as a member of the Supervisory Board as well as through the many years he served in executive positions at other companies in the automotive industry.

Subsequently, the Nomination Committee submits a candidate proposal to the Supervisory Board together with the reasons for its recommendation for decision-making. The decision of the Supervisory Board on the election proposal to the General Meeting shall always be based on the interests of the company, taking any and all circumstances of the individual case into account.\n\nThe terms of office of the shareholder representatives on the Supervisory Board of Mercedes-Benz Group AG end at different times ('staggered board'). Every year, on the General Meeting elects one or more shareholder representatives. The staggered board opens up the possibility of adapting the composition of the Supervisory Board more flexibly to a changing environment. In addition, it facilitates the search for suitable candidates, because not all seats on the shareholder side have to be filled at a single General Meeting. The Nomination Committee of the Supervisory Board regularly reviews which mandates end at which point in time and whether the relevant mandate holders are eligible and willing to serve a further term of office, taking the aforementioned criteria into account. In the search for new candidates, the Nomination Committee may rely on independent external recruitment consultancy services if it chooses to do so.\n\n## Shareholders and General Meeting\n\nThe shareholders exercise their membership rights, in particular their voting rights, at the General Meeting. Each share of Mercedes-Benz Group AG entitles the holder to one vote. Documents and information about the General Meeting are available at w group. mercedes-benz.com/am.\n\nIn the context of comprehensive investor and public relations, the company is in close contact with its shareholders. Shareholders, financial analysts, shareholder associations, the media and interested members of the public are regularly and comprehensively informed about the company's situation and are promptly informed about important business changes. The Chairman of the Supervisory Board is also prepared, within appropriate and reasonable limits, to discuss topics specific to the Supervisory Board with investors, including topics such as renumeration of the Board of Management as well as work and the structure of the Supervisory Board and its committees. Such discussions took place in the run up to the shareholder meetings in 2023 and 2024.\n\nIn addition to other channels of communication, the company makes very good use of the company website for investor relations. All key information published in 2023, including annual, quarterly and half-yearly financial reports, press releases, voting rights notifications by major shareholders, presentations and audio recordings from analyst and investor events and conference\n\ncalls, as well as the financial calendar, is available at w group.mercedes-benz.com/investors.

The Company is entered in the Commercial Register of the Stuttgart District Court under No. HRB 19360 and its registered office is located at Mercedesstra\u00dfe 120, 70372 Stuttgart, Germany.\n\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements of MercedesBenz Group AG are presented in euros ( \u20ac ). Unless otherwise stated, all amounts are stated in millions of euros. All figures shown are rounded.\n\n## IFRS issued, EU endorsed and adopted in the reporting period\n\nThe Board of Management of Mercedes-Benz Group AG authorized the Consolidated Financial Statements for publication on 15 March 2024.\n\n## Basis of preparation\n\n## Applied IFRS\n\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements of MercedesBenz Group AG and its subsidiaries ('Mercedes-Benz Group' or 'the Group') as of 31 December 2023 have been prepared in accordance with Section 315e of the German Commercial Code (HGB) (Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards) and comply with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) in the form in which they must be applied in the European Union (EU) as of 31 December 2023.\n\nIn May 2021, the IASB published Deferred taxes relating to assets and liabilities arising from a single transaction (amendments to IAS 12) . When assets and liabilities are recorded for the first time, under certain conditions deferred taxes previously did not have to be recognized due to an exception. The amendment to IAS 12 has the effect of cancelling this exception, which was important for the lessee's accounting of finance leases among other things. The Mercedes-Benz Group applied the changes for the first time in the financial year that commenced on 1 January 2023. There were no effects on the profitability, liquidity and capital resources, and financial position.\n\nIn December 2021, the OECD published guidelines for a new global minimum tax framework aimed at curbing base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) by multinational corporations. EU member states unanimously agreed in December 2022 to implement these rules in the form of a directive (BEPS Pillar 2 regulations). As at the balance sheet date, this directive was transposed into German law with the Act to Ensure Global Minimum\n\nCorporate GovernFurther Information Further Information",

As part of an analysis of possible effects on the Group, no countries were identified as at the reporting date from which significant effects are to be expected with regard to the possible payment of a minimum tax.\n\nTo introduce a mandatory temporary exemption from the requirements in IAS 12 Income Taxes for the recording and disclosure of information about deferred tax assets and liabilities, the IASB published International Tax Reform - Pillar 2 Model Rules (Amendments to IAS 12 ) in May 2023. The Mercedes-Benz Group applies the exception rule according to IAS 12, which stipulates that no deferred tax assets and liabilities are accounted for in connection with the income taxes of the second pillar ('Pillar 2') of the OECD.\n\nIn May 2017, the IASB published the standard IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts . IFRS 17 establishes more transparency and comparability with regard to the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of insurance contracts with the insurer. The application of IFRS 17 is mandatory for reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2023. The first-time application of IFRS 17 had no impact on the profitability, liquidity and capital resources and financial position of the Mercedes-Benz Group.\n\nStatements\n\nIn addition, other standards and interpretations were published which are not expected to have any significant impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Presentation\n\nStructured entities are entities which have been designed so that voting or similar rights are not relevant in deciding who controls the entity. This is the case for example if voting rights relate to administrative tasks only and the relevant activities are directed by means of contractual arrangements.\n\nPresentation in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position differentiates between current and non-current assets and liabilities. Assets and liabilities are generally classified as current if they are expected to be realized or settled within one year. Deferred tax assets and liabilities as well as assets and provisions for pensions and similar obligations are presented as non-current items.\n\nThe Consolidated Statement of Income is presented using the cost-of-sales method.\n\n## Principles of consolidation\n\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements include the financial statements of Mercedes-Benz Group AG and the financial statements of all subsidiaries, including structured entities, which are directly or indirectly controlled by Mercedes-Benz Group AG. Control exists if the parent company has the power of decision over a subsidiary based on voting rights or other rights, if it participates in positive and negative variable returns from a subsidiary, and if it can affect these returns by its power of decision.\n\nThe financial statements of consolidated subsidiaries which are included in the Consolidated Financial Statements are generally prepared as of the reporting date of the Consolidated Financial Statements. The financial statements of Mercedes-Benz Group AG and its companies included in the Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared using uniform recognition and measurement principles. Intra-Group assets and liabilities, equity, income and expenses as well as cash flows from transactions between consolidated entities are eliminated in the course of the consolidation process.\n\n## Business combinations and changes in equity interests\n\nBusiness combinations are accounted for using the purchase method. In connection with obtaining control, non-controlling interest in the acquiree is in principle recognized at the proportionate share of the acquiree's identifiable assets, which are measured at fair value.\n\nChanges in equity interests in subsidiaries that reduce or increase the Mercedes-Benz Group's percentage ownership without a change of control are accounted for as equity transactions between owners.

Amounts that were previously recognized in other comprehensive income/loss are recognized in other operating income or expense upon loss of control. If realization is not permitted, they are reclassified to retained earnings.\n\n## Investments in associated companies, joint ventures or joint operations\n\nAn associated company is an entity over which the Group has significant influence. Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee. Associated companies are generally accounted for using the equity method.\n\nFor entities over which the Mercedes-Benz Group has joint control together with a partner (joint arrangements), it is necessary to differentiate between whether a joint operation or a joint venture exists. In a joint venture, the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to the net assets of the arrangement. For joint ventures, the equity method has to be applied. A joint operation exists when the jointly controlling parties have direct rights to the assets and obligations for the liabilities. In this case, the prorated assets and liabilities and the prorated income and expenses are generally to be recognized (proportionate consolidation).\n\nStatements\n\nIf the financial statements of associated companies, joint ventures or joint operations should not be available in good time, the Group's proportionate share of the results of operations is included in the Mercedes-Benz Group's Consolidated Financial Statements with up to three-month time lag taking into account significant events or transactions.\n\n## Entities measured at amortized cost\n\nSubsidiaries, associated companies, joint ventures and joint operations whose business is non-active or of low volume and that individually and in sum are not material for the Group and the fair presentation of profitability, liquidity and capital resources, and financial position are generally measured at amortized cost in the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Foreign currency translation\n\nTransactions in foreign currency are translated at the relevant foreign exchange-rates prevailing at the transaction date. In subsequent periods, assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency are translated using period-end exchange-rates; gains and losses from this measurement are recognized in profit and loss (except for gains and losses resulting from the translation of equity instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income, which are recognized in other comprehensive income/loss).\n\nAssets and liabilities of foreign companies for which the functional currency is not the euro are translated into euros using period-end exchange-rates. The translation adjustments are presented in other comprehensive income/loss. The components of equity are translated using historical rates. The statements of income and cash flows are translated into euros using the quarterly average exchange-rates during the respective periods.\n\nThe exchange-rates providing the basis for the currency translation of the US dollar and the Chinese renminbi the most significant foreign currencies for the Mercedes-Benz Group - developed as shown in the following table.",

If a country is in hyperinflation, IAS 29 Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies has to be applied from the beginning of the respective reporting period, i.e., from 1 January of the respective reporting year. Argentina and Turkey are currently considered as in hyperinflation.\n\nThe effects of taking into account the devaluation of the monetary balance sheet items of subsidiaries in countries in hyperinflation are therefore recognized in profit or loss and are included in the Consolidated\n\nStatement of Income under other operating expenses or other operating income.\n\nDue to the close economic relationship, the effects from the recognition of the inflation effect together with the conversion effect from the translation are presented as a currency effect in accordance with IAS 21. Both effects are presented on a net basis in other comprehensive income or directly in retained earnings.\n\nFor companies that use hyperinflation accounting, the profit and loss statements and the cash flow statements are converted into euros using the exchangerates at the end of the period.",

This generally occurs at the time the customer takes possession of the products.\n\nIf a dealer is not classified as a principal but as an agent and therefore control of vehicles is not transferred to him, sales revenue is only recorded when the end customer obtains control. The brokerage commissions payable to the dealer are shown in selling expenses.\n\nRevenue recognition from the sale of vehicles for which the Group enters into a repurchase obligation is dependent on the form of the repurchase agreement.\n\n- -Sales of vehicles by which the Mercedes-Benz Group is obliged to repurchase the vehicles in the future are accounted for as operating leases. This also applies to a call option that grants the Mercedes-Benz Group the right to repurchase.\n- -Sales of vehicles including a put option (an entity's obligation to repurchase the asset at the customer's request) are reported as operating leases if the customer has a significant economic incentive to exercise that right at contract inception. Otherwise, a sale\n\nStatements\n\nwith a right of return is reported. The Mercedes-Benz Group considers several factors when assessing whether the customer has a significant economic incentive to exercise his or her right. Among others, these are the relation between the agreed repurchase price and the expected future market value (at the time of repurchase) of the asset, or historical return rates.\n\nArrangements such as when the Mercedes-Benz Group provides customers with a guaranteed minimum resale value that they receive on resale (residual-value guarantee) do not constrain the customers in their ability to direct the use of and obtain substantially all of the benefits from the asset. At contract inception of a sale with a residual-value guarantee, revenue therefore has to be recognized, reduced by a potential compensation payment to the customer (revenue deferral).\n\nUnder a contract manufacturing agreement, the Mercedes-Benz Group sells assets to a third-party manufacturer from which the Mercedes-Benz Group buys back the manufactured products after completion of the commissioned work. If the provision of material is not associated with the transfer of control to the service provider, no revenue is recognized.\n\nFor certain products sold by the Group, it offers extended, separately priced warranties that go beyond the statutory period, as well as service and maintenance contracts. Usual for such contracts is an advance payment or the payment of constant instalments over\n\nthe term of the contract. If the customer has made an advance payment, the revenue from these contracts is deferred as a contract liability and recognized as revenue over the term of the contract in proportion to the costs expected to be incurred based on historical information. A future loss on these contracts is recognized in the current reporting year if the expected costs for outstanding services under the contract exceed unearned revenue.\n\nFor multiple-element arrangements, such as when vehicles are sold with free or reduced-in-price maintenance contracts or with free online services, the Group generally allocates revenue to the various elements based on their estimated relative stand-alone selling prices. To determine stand-alone selling prices, the Mercedes-Benz Group primarily uses price lists with consideration of average price reductions granted to its customers.\n\nDepending on the sales model, vehicles may be initially sold to non-Group dealers. When control of the vehicle is transferred to the non-Group dealer, the MercedesBenz Group recognizes revenue from the sale of the vehicle. Irrespective of this, an end customer can decide to enter into a leasing contract with MercedesBenz Mobility regarding such a vehicle. The vehicle is then sold by the non-Group dealer to Mercedes-Benz Mobility.",

Revenue generated from operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the periods of the contracts. In addition, sales revenue is generated at the end of lease contracts from the subsequent sale of the vehicles. Revenue from receivables from financial services is recognized using the effective-interest method.\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz Group uses a variety of sales promotion programmes dependent on various market conditions in individual countries as well as the respective product life cycles and product-related factors (such as amounts of discounts offered by competitors, excess industry production capacity, the intensity of market competition and consumer demand for the products). These programmes comprise cash offers to dealers and customers as well as lease subsidies or loans at reduced interest rates which are reported as follows:\n\nStatements\n\n- -Revenue is recognized net of sales reductions such as cash discounts and sales incentives granted.\n\n## Research and non-capitalized development costs\n\n- -When loans are issued below market rates, related receivables are recognized at present value (using market rates) and revenue is reduced for the interest incentive granted.\n- -If subsidised leasing fees are agreed upon in connection with finance leases, revenue from the sale of a vehicle is reduced by the amount of the interest incentive granted.\n\nExpenditure for research and development that does not meet the conditions for capitalization according to IAS 38 Intangible Assets is expensed as incurred.\n\n## Borrowing costs\n\nBorrowing costs are expensed as incurred, unless they are directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset and are therefore part of the acquisition or manufacturing costs of that asset. Depreciation of the capitalized borrowing costs is presented within cost of sales.\n\n## Government grants\n\nGovernment grants related to assets are deducted from the carrying amount of the asset and are recognized in earnings over the life of a depreciable asset as a reduced depreciation expense. Government grants which compensate the Group for expenses are recognized as other operating income in the same period as the expenses themselves.\n\nCorporate GovernFurther Information Further Information",

The MercedesBenz Group's share of dilution gains and losses resulting from the Group's non-participation or subproportional participation in capital increases of companies in which shares are held and are accounted for using the equity method is also included in gains/losses on equity-method investments.

Furthermore, interest and changes in fair values related to interest rate hedging activities as well as income and expense resulting from the allocation of premiums and discounts are included. The interest components of defined benefit pension commitments and similar obligations, as well as of the plan assets available to cover these obligations and interest on supplementary income tax payments or reimbursements are also presented in this line item.\n\nInterest income and expense and gains or losses from derivative financial instruments related to the financial services business are disclosed under revenue and cost of sales respectively.\n\nExpense from the compounding of interest on provisions for other risks is presented in other financial income/expense.\n\n## Income taxes\n\nIncome taxes are comprised of current income taxes and deferred taxes.\n\nCurrent income taxes are calculated based on the respective local taxable income and local tax rules for the period. The calculation of income taxes of Mercedes-Benz Group AG and its subsidiaries is based on the legislation and regulations applicable in the various countries. In addition, current income taxes presented for the reporting year include adjustments for uncertain tax payments or tax refunds for periods not yet finally assessed; however, excluding interest expenses and interest refunds and penalties on the underpayment of taxes. In cases for which it is probable that amounts declared as expenses in the tax returns might not be recognized (uncertain tax positions), a liability for income taxes is recognized. The amount is based on the best estimate of the expected tax payment (expected amount or most likely amount). Taxrefund claims from uncertain tax positions are recognized when it is probable that they can be realized. Only in the case of tax-loss carryforwards or unused tax credits, no liability for taxes or tax claim is recognized for these uncertain tax positions.

Measurement is based on the tax rates expected to be effective in the period in which an asset is recognized or a liability is settled. For this purpose, the tax rates and tax rules are used which have been enacted at the reporting date or are soon to be enacted. Deferred tax assets are recognized to the extent that it is probable that there will be future taxable income available against which the deductible temporary differences, tax-loss carryforwards and tax credits can be utilized. Deferred tax liabilities for taxable temporary differences in connection with investments in subsidiaries, branches, associated companies and interests in joint arrangements are not recognized if the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not be reversed in the foreseeable future.\n\nFor the calculation of deferred tax assets, assumptions have to be made regarding future taxable income and the time of realization of the deferred tax assets. In this context, the Mercedes-Benz Group takes into consideration, among other things, the projected earnings from business activities, the effects on earnings of the reversal of taxable temporary differences, and realizable\n\nStatements\n\ntax strategies. On each balance sheet date, the Mercedes-Benz Group carries out impairment tests on deferred tax assets on the basis of the planned taxable income in future years. Deferred tax assets are only recognized if it is more likely than not that future tax benefits can be realized.\n\n## Earnings per share\n\nBasic earnings per share are calculated by dividing profit attributable to shareholders of Mercedes-Benz Group AG by the weighted average number of shares outstanding.\n\n## Intangible assets\n\nIntangible assets are measured at acquisition or manufacturing cost less accumulated amortization. If necessary, accumulated impairment losses are recognized.\n\nIntangible assets with indefinite useful lives are reviewed annually to determine whether indefinite-life assessment continues to be appropriate. If not, the change in the useful-life assessment from indefinite to finite is made on a prospective basis.\n\nDevelopment costs for vehicles and components are capitalized if the recognition criteria according to IAS 38 are met. Subsequent to initial recognition, the asset is carried at acquisition or manufacturing costs less accumulated amortization and accumulated impairment losses. Capitalized development costs include all direct costs and pro-rata allocable overheads. Capitalized development costs for vehicles and vehicle components are amortized on a straight-line basis over the expected product life cycle. The planned product lifespan only exceeds ten years in individual cases. The assessment also takes into account possible impacts from the transformation of the automotive industry, such as the transition to electric drive systems. Amortization of capitalized development costs is an element of manufacturing costs and is allocated to those vehicles and components by which they were generated and is included in cost of sales when the inventory (vehicles) is sold.\n\nCorporate GovernFurther Information Further Information",

Changes in expected useful lives are treated as changes in accounting estimates. The amortization expense on intangible assets with finite useful lives is recorded in functional costs.\n\nWith acquisitions of businesses, goodwill represents the excess of the consideration transferred over the fair values assigned to the identifiable assets proportionally acquired and liabilities assumed.

Variable lease payments that are not included in the initial recognition of the right-of-use asset are recognized as an expense for the period.\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz Group applies both recognition exemptions for leases with a lease term of twelve months or less (short-term leases) and for leases for which the underlying asset is of low value, not to recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability. The lease payments associated with those leases are generally recognized as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n\n## Property, plant and equipment\n\nProperty, plant and equipment are measured at acquisition or manufacturing costs less accumulated depreciation.

The lease liabilities include the following lease payments:\n\n- -fixed payments including de facto fixed payments less lease incentives receivables from the lessor;\n- -variable lease payments linked to an index or interest rate;\n- -amounts expected to be payable under residualvalue guarantees;\n- -the exercise price of purchase options, when exercise is estimated to be reasonably certain, and\n- -contractual penalties for the termination of a lease if the lease term reflects the exercise of a termination option.\n\nStatements\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz Group generally also applies the option for contracts comprising lease components as well as non-lease components not to split these components.\n\nLease payments are discounted at the rate implicit in the lease if that rate can readily be determined. Otherwise, discounting is at the incremental borrowing rate. This incremental borrowing rate as a risk-adjusted interest rate is derived on a maturity- and currency specific basis. As the cash flow pattern of the reference interest rates (bullet bonds) does not correspond to the cash flow pattern of a lease contract (annuity), a duration adjustment in order to account for that difference is used.\n\nIn the subsequent measurement of a lease liability, the carrying amount is increased to reflect interest on the lease liability and reduced to reflect the lease payments made. According to IFRS 16, the depreciation of right-of-use assets is recognized within functional costs. The interest due on the lease liability is a component of interest expense. Extension and termination options are part of a number of leases particularly of real estate. In determining the lease term, those options are only considered if their exercise is reasonably certain. During the term, these options are regularly checked with regard to their probability of being exercised.\n\nA right-of-use asset is subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated depreciation and, if necessary, any accumulated impairment. If the lease transfers ownership of the underlying asset to the lessee at the end of the lease term or if the cost of the right-of-use asset reflects that the lessee will exercise a purchase option, the right-of-use asset is depreciated to the end of the useful life of the underlying asset. Otherwise, the right-of-use asset is depreciated to the end of the lease term.\n\nCorporate GovernFurther Information Further Information",

Additionally, an operating lease may have to be reported with sales of vehicles for which the Group enters into a repurchase obligation.\n\n- -Sales of vehicles by which the Mercedes-Benz Group is obliged to repurchase the vehicles in the future are accounted for as operating leases. This also applies to a call option that only grants the Mercedes-Benz Group the right to repurchase.\n- -Sales of vehicles including a put option (an entity's obligation to repurchase the asset at the customer's request) are reported as operating leases if the customer has a significant economic incentive to exercise that right. Otherwise, a sale with a right of return is reported. The Mercedes-Benz Group considers several factors when assessing whether a customer has a significant economic incentive to exercise his or her right at contract inception. Among others, these are the relation between the repurchase price\n\nStatements\n\nand the expected future market value (at the time of repurchase) of the asset, or historical return rates.\n\nAs part of the residual-value management process, especially for operating lease contracts, certain assumptions are regularly made regarding the expected level of prices, based upon which the cars to be returned in the leasing business are evaluated. If changing market developments at the balance sheet date lead to a negative deviation from previously estimated assumptions, the residual value must be adjusted or an impairment carried out. Depending on the region and the current market situation, the risk-mitigation measures taken generally include continuous market monitoring as well as, if required, price-setting strategies or sales-promotion measures designed to regulate vehicle inventories. Market forecasts are verified by regular comparisons of internal and external sources, and, if required, the determination of residual values is adjusted and further developed with regard to methods, processes and systems.\n\nIn the case of accounting as an operating lease, these vehicles are capitalized at the (amortized) cost of production under equipment on operating leases and are depreciated over the contract term on a straight-line basis with consideration of the expected residual values. Changes in the expected residual values lead either to prospective adjustments of the scheduled depreciation or, if necessary, to an impairment loss. The vehicles are allocated to the segment which bears substantially all of the residual-value risk.\n\nOperating leases also relate to vehicles, primarily Group products that Mercedes-Benz Mobility acquires from non-Group dealers or other third parties and leases to end customers. These vehicles are presented at (amortized) cost of acquisition under equipment on operating leases in the Mercedes-Benz Mobility segment. If these vehicles are Group products and are subsidized and these subsidies are passed on in the lease agreement with the external customer, the subsidies are deducted from the acquisition cost. After revenue is received from the sale to independent dealers, these Group products generate revenue from lease payments and subsequent resale on the basis of the separate leasing contracts.\n\nIn the case of finance leases , the Group presents the receivables under receivables from financial services in an amount corresponding to the net investment of the lease agreements. The net investment of a lease agreement is the gross investment (future lease payments and non-guaranteed residual value) discounted at the rate upon which the lease agreement is based.\n\nMercedes-Benz Mobility continues the leasing and sales-financing business for Daimler Truck's commercial vehicles in some markets. To this end, MercedesBenz Mobility acquires these vehicles from Daimler Truck and leases them to the end customers. Insofar as a mandatory vehicle return to Daimler Truck has been agreed, a leasing contract (head lease) between Mercedes-Benz Mobility and Daimler Truck is shown.

The leases that were concluded before the legal spin-off and hive-down are continued as operating leases. The head lease is presented under equipment on operating leases as a right of use, which was recognized at fair value at the spinoff date and subsequently depreciated on a straightline basis. In addition, a residual-value receivable from the companies of the Daimler Truck Group is recognized. However, the leasing contracts concluded after the legal spin-off and hive-down are classified and accounted for as finance leases. The net investment in the lease corresponds to the right-of-use asset from the head lease. In addition to the finance lease, Mercedes-Benz Mobility recognizes a residual-value receivable from the Daimler Truck Group in the amount of the guaranteed residual value. The head lease is not recorded separately.\n\nStatements\n\n## Impairment of non-current non-financial assets\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired or whether there is an indication that a previously recognized impairment loss may be reversed. If such indication exists, the Mercedes-Benz Group estimates the recoverable amount of the asset. The recoverable amount is determined for each individual asset unless the asset generates cash inflows that are not largely independent of those from other assets or other groups of assets (cash-generating units).\n\ntesting is carried out below segment level. A distinction is made between the two cash-generating units Mercedes-Benz Mobility Classic (traditional financial services business) and Charging Solutions (development of a high-power charging network). As the Charging Solutions cash-generating unit had neither goodwill nor other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives in 2023 and there was no indication of impairment in 2023, it was not necessary to calculate the recoverable amount.\n\nAn assessment is made at each reporting date as to whether there is any indication that previously recognized impairment losses may no longer exist or may be reversed. If this is the case, the Mercedes-Benz Group records a partial or entire reversal of the impairment; the carrying amount is thereby increased to the recoverable amount. However, the increased carrying amount may not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined (net of scheduled depreciation) if no impairment loss had been recognized in prior years.\n\nGoodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are tested at least annually for impairment. This takes place at the level of the cash-generating units. The cash-generating units Mercedes-Benz Cars and Mercedes-Benz Vans basically correspond to the segments. At Mercedes-Benz Mobility, impairment\n\nIf it is determined that the carrying amount of an asset or of a cash-generating unit exceeds the recoverable amount, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference.\n\nThe recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and value in use. For cash-generating units, the Mercedes-Benz Group in a first step determines the respective recoverable amount as value in use and compares it with the respective carrying amount (including goodwill). If value in use is lower than the carrying amount, fair value less costs of disposal is additionally calculated to determine the recoverable amount.\n\nCorporate GovernFurther Information Further Information",

Future cash flows are determined on the basis of the long-term planning, which is approved by management and which is valid at the date when the impairment test is conducted. This planning, which covers the period up to and including 2028, is based on assumptions, including those regarding future sales volumes, the general development of the respective markets and the profitability of the products, taking into account the effects of the transformation of the automotive industry and the expected macroeconomic developments. In the detailed planning period, an overall moderate increase in unit sales and revenue is assumed for the cash-generating units Mercedes-Benz Cars and Mercedes-Benz Vans, with a significant increase in the proportion of electric vehicles. Based on the sales planning of the cash-generating units Mercedes-Benz Cars and Mercedes-Benz Vans, the planning of the cash-generating unit Mercedes-Benz Mobility Classic assumes an increase in the portfolio in the detailed planning period. The assumptions used for planning are checked for plausibility both against historical developments and against external sources of information (e.g. market studies). The rounded, risk-adjusted interest rates determined specifically for the respective cash-generating unit and used to discount the cash flows are 9.5% (2022: 9%) after taxes for the Mercedes-Benz Cars and Mercedes-Benz Vans cashgenerating units. A risk-adjusted interest rate of 10% (2022: 10%) after taxes is used for the Mercedes-Benz\n\nMobility Classic cash-generating unit. While the discount rate for the Mercedes-Benz Mobility Classic cash-generating unit represents the cost of equity, the risk-adjusted interest rate for the Mercedes-Benz Cars and Mercedes-Benz Vans cash-generating units is based on the weighted average cost of capital (WACC). This is calculated based on the capital asset pricing model (CAPM), taking into account current market expectations. In calculating the risk-adjusted interest rate for impairment-test purposes, specific peer group information is used for beta factors, capital-structure data and cost of debt. Periods not covered by the forecast are taken into account by recognizing a residual value (terminal value), which does not include any growth rates. When deriving the terminal value, assumptions regarding the effects of the transformation of the automotive industry are also taken into account, analogous to the detailed planning period. When deriving the value in use, a risk assessment is also carried out for both the detailed planning period and the terminal value, which includes, for example, market risks as well as risks resulting from legal and political framework conditions (e.g. in connection with sustainability aspects). This risk assessment shows for the relevant cash-generating units that even in the case of reasonably possible changes in operational key assumptions (e.g. profitability of the products, unit sales and portfolio) compared to the original planning, no need for impairment exists. While the recoverable amount of the Mercedes-Benz Cars and MercedesBenz Vans cash-generating units significantly exceeds the carrying amount, the recoverable amount of the\n\nStatements\n\nMercedes-Benz Mobility Classic cash-generating unit is close to the carrying amount. In addition, sensitivity analyses are carried out (e.g. with regard to the discount rate). The carrying amount of the Mercedes-Benz Mobility Classic cash-generating unit would exceed the recoverable amount if, in addition to a change in operational key assumptions, the cost of equity were to increase slightly.\n\nCorporate GovernFurther Information Further Information",

If the Group loses control of a subsidiary and subsequently presents it at equity, the fair value of the retained shares represents the acquisition cost.\n\nOn the date of acquisition, a positive difference between cost of acquisition and the Mercedes-Benz Group's share of the fair values of the identifiable assets and liabilities of the associated company or joint venture is determined and recognized as investor level goodwill. The goodwill is included in the carrying amount of the equity-method investment. If an equity interest in an existing associated company is increased without change in significant influence, goodwill is determined only for the additionally acquired interest; the previous investment is not remeasured at fair value.\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz Group reviews on each reporting date whether there is any objective indication of impairments or impairment reversals of equity-method investments. If such indications exist, the Group determines the impairment loss or reversal to be recognized. If the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount of an investment, the carrying amount is written down to the recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the greater of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. An impairment reversal is carried out if\n\nStatements\n\nthere is objective evidence for an impairment reversal. If such an assessment is made, the recoverable amount is remeasured. An impairment reversal is recognized to the extent that the recoverable amount has increased subsequent to the impairment and is limited to the amount by which an asset has been impaired.\n\nGains or losses to be eliminated from transactions with companies accounted for using the equity method are recognized through profit and loss with corresponding adjustments of the investments' carrying amounts. Gains or losses from the contribution of interests in subsidiaries to investments which are measured using the equity method are also subject to elimination adjustments to the carrying amount of the investment.\n\n## Non-current assets and disposal groups held for sale\n\nThe Group classifies non-current assets or disposal groups as held for sale if the carrying amount will be recovered principally through an extremely likely sale transaction rather than through continuing use. In this case, the assets or disposal groups are no longer depreciated as planned, but are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. Immediately before classification as held for sale, it is assessed if the assets are impaired based on the applicable individual regulations. If fair value less costs to sell subsequently increases, any impairment loss previously recognized is reversed. This reversal is restricted to the impairment loss previously recognized for the assets or disposal group concerned.\n\n## Inventories\n\nInventories are measured at the lower of acquisition or manufacturing cost and net realizable value. The net realizable value is the expected sales price less estimated costs of completion and estimated costs to sell. The acquisition or manufacturing costs of inventories are generally based on the specific identification method and include costs incurred in acquiring the inventories and bringing them to their present location and condition. Acquisition or manufacturing costs for large numbers of inventories that are interchangeable are allocated under the average-cost formula.\n\nCorporate GovernFurther Information Further Information",

Financial instruments in the form of financial assets and financial liabilities are generally presented separately. Financial instruments are recognized as soon as the MercedesBenz Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the financial instrument. In the case of purchases or sales of financial assets through the regular market, the Mercedes-Benz Group uses the transaction date as the date of initial recognition or derecognition.\n\nUpon initial recognition, financial instruments are measured at fair value. For the purpose of subsequent measurement, financial instruments are allocated to one of the categories mentioned in IFRS 9 Financial Instruments (financial assets measured at amortized cost, financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income and financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss). Transaction costs directly attributable to acquisition or issuance are considered when determining the carrying amount if the financial instruments are not measured at fair value through profit or loss.\n\nStatements\n\n## Financial assets\n\n## Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss\n\nFinancial assets primarily comprise receivables from financial services, trade receivables, receivables from banks, cash on hand, derivative financial assets, marketable securities and similar investments and financial investments.\n\nThe classification of financial instruments is based on the business model in which these instruments are held and on their contractual cash flows.\n\nThe determination of the business model is carried out at the portfolio level and is based on management's intention and past transaction patterns. Assessments of the contractual cash flows are made on an instrument-by-instrument basis.\n\nFinancial assets recognized at fair value through profit or loss include financial assets with cash flows other than those of principal and interest on the nominal amount outstanding. Furthermore, financial assets that are held in a business model other than 'hold to collect' or 'hold to collect and sell' are included here.\n\nIn addition, derivatives, including embedded derivatives separated from the host contract, which are not classified as hedging instruments in hedge accounting, as well as shares and marketable debt securities acquired for the purpose of selling in the short term that are classified as held for trading, are included here. Gains or losses on these financial assets are recognized in profit or loss.\n\n## Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income\n\nFinancial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income are non-derivative financial assets with contractual cash flows that consist solely of payments of principal and interest on the nominal amount outstanding and which are held to collect the contractual cash flows as well as to sell the financial assets, e.g. to achieve a defined liquidity target (business model 'hold to collect and sell').

Interest earned on financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income is generally reported as interest income using the effective-interest method.

After initial recognition, these financial assets at amortized cost are subsequently carried at amortized cost using the effective-interest method less any loss allowances. Gains and losses are recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Income when the financial assets at amortized cost are impaired or derecognized. Interest effects from the application of the effective-interest method are also recognized in profit or loss as well as effects from foreign currency translation.\n\nCash and cash equivalents consist primarily of cash on hand, cheques and demand deposits at banks, as well as debt instruments and certificates of deposits with a remaining term when acquired of up to three months, which are not subject to any material value fluctuations. Cash and cash equivalents correspond with the classification in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.\n\nAt each reporting date, an impairment is recognized for financial assets, loan commitments and financial guarantees other than those to be measured at fair value through profit or loss reflecting expected credit losses for these instruments.

The expected credit loss is recognized as an impairment measured over the expected lifetime of the financial asset. Objective evidence for a credit-impaired financial asset includes 91 days past due date and other information about significant financial difficulties of the debtor.\n\nThe determination of whether a financial asset has experienced a significant increase in credit risk is based on an assessment of the probability of default, which is made at least quarterly, incorporating external credit rating information as well as internal information on the credit quality of the financial asset. For debt instruments that are not receivables from financial services, a significant increase in credit risk is assessed mainly based on past-due information or the probability of default.\n\nA financial asset is migrated to stage 2 if the asset's credit risk has increased significantly compared to its credit risk at initial recognition. The credit risk is assessed based on the probability of default. For trade receivables, the simplified approach is applied whereby all trade receivables are allocated to stage 2 initially. Hence, no determination of significant increases in credit risk is necessary.\n\nStatements\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz Group applies the low-credit-risk exception to the stage allocation to quoted debt instruments with investment-grade ratings. These debt instruments are always allocated to stage 1.\n\nIn stages 1 and 2, the effective interest revenue is calculated based on gross carrying amounts. If a financial asset becomes credit impaired in stage 3, the effective interest revenue is calculated based on its net carrying amount (gross carrying amount adjusted for any loss allowance).\n\n## Measurement of expected credit losses\n\nExpected credit losses are measured in a way that reflects:\n\na)\n\n- the unbiased and probability-weighted amount;\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- b) the time value of money;\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- c) reasonable and supportable information (if available without undue cost or effort) at the reporting date about past events, current conditions and forecasts of future economic conditions.\n\nExpected credit losses are measured as the probability-weighted present value of all cash shortfalls over the expected life of each financial asset. For receivables from financial services, expected credit losses are calculated using a statistical model with three major risk parameters: probability of default, loss given default and exposure at default.\n\nThe estimation of these risk parameters incorporates all available relevant information, not only historical and current loss data, but also reasonable and supportable forward-looking information reflected by future expectations. This information includes macroeconomic factors (e.g. gross domestic product growth, unemployment rate, cost performance index) and forecasts of future economic conditions.

The fair value of listed derivatives is equal to their positive or negative market value.

This may apply for example to the time value of options, the forward element of a forward contract or cross-currency basis spreads.\n\nHedge relationships are to be discontinued prospectively if a particular hedge relationship ceases to meet the qualifying criteria for hedge accounting under IFRS 9. Instances that require discontinuation of hedge accounting are, among others, changes to the designated hedged item, loss of the economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument, disposal or termination of the hedging instrument, or a revision of the documented risk-management objective of a particular hedge relationship. Accumulated hedging gains and losses from cash flow hedges are retained and are reclassified from equity as described at maturity if the hedged future cash flows are still expected to occur. Otherwise, accumulated hedging gains and losses are immediately reclassified to profit or loss.\n\nIf derivative financial instruments do not or no longer qualify for hedge accounting because the qualifying criteria for hedge accounting are not or are no longer met, the derivative financial instruments are classified as held for trading and are measured at fair value through profit or loss.\n\nStatements\n\n## Pensions and similar obligations\n\nThe measurement of defined benefit commitments for pensions and other similar post-employment benefits (healthcare benefits) in accordance with IAS 19 Employee Benefits is based on the projected unit-credit method. Plan assets invested to cover defined benefit pension commitments and other post-employment benefit obligations are measured at fair value and offset against the corresponding obligations.\n\nThe discount factors used to calculate the present values of defined benefit pension obligations are to be determined  - with maturities and currencies matching the pension payments  - by reference to market yields at the end of the reporting period on high-quality fixedrate corporate bonds in the respective markets. For very long maturities, there are no high-quality corporate bonds available as a benchmark. The respective discount factors are estimated by extrapolating current market rates along the yield curve.\n\nThe balance of defined benefit commitments for pensions and other post-employment benefit obligations and plan assets (net pension obligation or net pension assets) accrues interest at the discount rate used as a basis for the measurement of the gross pension obligation. The resulting net interest expense or income is recognized in profit and loss under interest expense or interest income in the Consolidated Statement of Income. The other expenses resulting from pension commitments and other post-employment benefit obligations, which mainly result from entitlements acquired during the year under review, are taken into consideration in functional costs in the Consolidated Statement of Income. Differences between the assumptions made and actual developments as well as changes in actuarial assumptions for the measurement of defined benefit plans and similar obligations result in actuarial gains and losses, which are recognized in equity through other comprehensive income.\n\nGains or losses on the curtailment or settlement of a defined benefit plan are recognized in profit or loss when the curtailment or settlement occurs.\n\nCorporate GovernFurther Information Further Information",

The amount recognized as a provision represents the best estimate of the obligation at the reporting date. Provisions with an original maturity of more than one year are discounted to the present value of the expenditures expected to settle the obligation at the end of the reporting period.\n\nIf the recognition criteria of provisions are not fulfilled and the possibility of a cash outflow upon settlement is not unlikely, the item is to be presented as a contingent liability, insofar as it is adequately measurable. The amount disclosed as a contingent liability represents the best estimate of the possible obligation at the reporting date. Provisions and contingent liabilities are regularly reviewed and adjusted as further information becomes available or circumstances change.\n\nA provision for expected warranty costs is recognized when a product is sold or when a new warranty programme is initiated. Estimates for accrued warranty costs are particularly based on historical experience. Other assumptions include, but are not limited to, the amount of potential repair costs. The provisions are regularly adjusted to reflect new information.\n\nStatements\n\nRestructuring provisions are set up in connection with programmes that materially change the scope of business performed by a segment or business unit or the manner in which business is conducted. In most cases, restructuring expenses include termination benefits and compensation payments due to the termination of agreements with suppliers and dealers. Benefits on termination of employment are recognized when the Group has a detailed formal plan that has either commenced implementation or been announced.\n\n## Contract and refund liabilities\n\n## Contract liabilities\n\nA contract liability is an entity's obligation to transfer goods or services to a customer for which the entity has received consideration (or the amount is due) from the customer.\n\n## Refund liabilities\n\nA refund liability occurs if the Mercedes-Benz Group receives consideration from a customer and expects to refund some or all of that consideration to the customer. A refund liability is measured at the amount of consideration received for which the Mercedes-Benz Group does not expect to be entitled and is thus not included in the transaction price.\n\n## Share-based paymen t\n\nShare-based payment comprises cash-settled liability awards.\n\nLiability awards are measured at fair value at each balance sheet date until settlement and are classified as provisions under consideration of vesting conditions. The profit or loss of the period equals the addition to and/or the reversal of the provision during the reporting period and the dividend equivalent paid during the period, and is included in functional costs.",

The Mercedes-Benz Group is aiming to shape the transformation into a software-driven and all-electric future. The Group is creating the necessary conditions to become all-electric. The pace of the transformation is determined by market conditions and the wishes of customers. Recognition and measurement of the Group's assets and liabilities take into account climaterelated risks and developments associated with the transformation, which also include the climate targets set in the Paris Climate Agreement.\n\nAccounting estimates and management judgements in connection with sustainability-related aspects are taken into consideration in particular in the accounting of assets and liabilities described below:\n\nThe determination and review of the useful lives of the capitalized development costs are based on the expected product life cycle. Changes in the originally envisaged product life cycles can result from the transformation to all-electric vehicles. Due to the resolutions regarding the accelerated transformation new developments in the area of conventional powertrains are reduced and already capitalized development expenditure will partly be used for longer.\n\nIn the same way, the useful lives of property, plant and equipment assets are regularly reviewed in the light of the transformation to all-electric vehicles. This did not require any material adjustments of the useful lives up to the reporting date as the production facilities of the Group are basically flexible in use.\n\nIn the context of production network management, efforts are also being made to secure sites affected by the transformation by enhancing them. No significant obligations to dismantle or remove production facilities and plants that would give rise to a provision existed on the reporting date.",

When determining recoverability, the expected residual value of the leased vehicles is particularly relevant. Due to the transformation to all-electric vehicles, residual values can be influenced by changing customer behavior, new regulatory requirements and further technological developments. Although the currently expected residual values of all-electric vehicles were lower than originally expected, no significant impairment losses were required for conventionally powered or all-electric vehicles in the reporting year.\n\nThe expected proceeds from the disposal of vehicles pledged as collateral were taken into account in the determination of expected credit losses for receivables from financial services. The expected proceeds from the disposal were based on an estimate of the market value at the expected time of a possible default. There were no indications of a reduction of these estimated market values that could be traced to effects of climate change or of changing customer behaviour as of the reporting date.\n\nIn addition to traditional energy supply contracts, which are usually only recorded as pending transactions upon delivery, the Group has concluded contracts to secure purchase quantities and prices for renewable energies (in particular electricity from wind and solar energy). These are contracts that provide for a fixed remuneration per unit of energy and are mainly recognized either as derivatives or leases.\n\nStatements\n\nThe impairment test on the level of the cash-generating units is based on the corporate planning and strategy of the Mercedes-Benz Group. This provides for a step by step substitution of vehicles with combustion engines by electric vehicles.\n\nFor the purposes of the impairment test, further risks (e.g. sales risks, price risks and risks regarding the future price of raw materials) were also taken into account. Additional corporate planning parameters in connection with the transformation affect the investment requirements and the currently higher variable costs of all-electric vehicles in comparison with vehicles with conventional powertrains. The simultaneous development, model refinement and production of electric and conventionally powered vehicles results in a high investment requirement, particularly in the detail planning period until 2028. No growth was assumed in the derivation of the terminal value, due in part to the not yet completely predictable effects of the competitive situation and customer behaviour in the course of the transition to electric mobility. The impairment test carried out taking into account the transformation effects described did not result in any impairment requirement for the cash-generating units.\n\nCorporate GovernFurther Information Further Information",

Accounting estimates and management judgements\n\nIn the Consolidated Financial Statements, it is to a certain degree necessary to make estimates and management judgements which can affect the amounts and reporting of assets and liabilities, the reporting of contingent assets and liabilities on the balance sheet date, and the income and expense reported for the period. The major items affected by such estimates and management judgements are described as follows. Actual amounts may differ from the estimates. Changes in the estimates and management judgements can have a material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Recoverable amounts of cash-generating units and equity-method investments\n\nIn the context of impairment tests for non-financial assets, estimates have to be made to determine the recoverable amounts of cash-generating units. Assumptions have to be made in particular with regard to future cash inflows and outflows for the planning period and the following periods. The estimates mainly refer to future unit sales, growth in the respective markets and the profitability of the products, which are also highly dynamic and thus uncertain as a result of the transition to electric mobility. Therefore, a risk assessment and sensitivity analyses are performed when\n\nStatements\n\nderiving the value in use. On the basis of the impairment tests carried out in 2023, the recoverable amounts are larger than the net assets of the Group's cash-generating units.\n\nWhen objective evidence of impairment or impairment reversal is present, estimates and assessments also have to be made to determine the recoverable amount of an equity-method investment. The determination of the recoverable amount is based on assumptions regarding future business developments for the determination of the expected future cash flows of that investment. On the balance sheet date, the carrying amount of equity-method investments was \u20ac 13,104 million (31 December 2022: \u20ac 13,530 million).\n\n## Recoverable amount of equipment on operating leases\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz Group regularly reviews the factors determining the values of its leased vehicles (carrying amount as of 31 December 2023: \u20ac 41,712 milllion; 31 December 2022: \u20ac 41,552 million). In particular, it is necessary to estimate the residual values of vehicles, which constitute a substantial part of the expected future cash flows from equipment on operating leases. In this context, assumptions are made regarding major influencing factors, such as the expected number of returned vehicles, the latest remarketing results and future vehicle model changes. Those assumptions are determined either by qualified estimates or by publications provided by expert third parties. Qualified estimates are based, as far as publicly available, on external data with consideration of internally available additional information such as historical experience of price developments and sale prices. The residual values thus determined serve as a basis for depreciation; changes in residual values lead either to prospective adjustments of the depreciation or, in the case of a significant decline in expected residual values, to an impairment. If depreciation is prospectively adjusted, changes in estimates of residual values do not have a direct effect but are equally distributed over the remaining term of the lease contract.",

Many factors are taken into consideration in this context including historical loss experience, the size and composition of certain portfolios, current economic events and conditions and the current fair values and adequacy of collaterals. In addition to historical and current information on losses, appropriate and reliable forward-looking information on factors is also included. This information includes macroeconomic factors (e.g. gross domestic product growth, unemployment rate, cost performance index) and forecasts of future economic conditions. For receivables from financial services, these forecasts are performed using a scenario analysis (basic scenario, optimistic scenario and pessimistic scenario). Further external information which cannot be depicted in the scenarios, is - as far as necessary - included in the assessment through subsequent adjustments. Changes to the estimation and assessment of these factors influence the allowance for credit losses with a resulting impact on the Group's net profit.\n\nStatements\n\n## Product warranties\n\n## Liability and litigation risks and governmental proceedings\n\nThe Group provides various types of product warranties, depending on the type of product and market conditions. Provisions for product warranties (carrying amount as of 31 December 2023: \u20ac 6,399 million; 31 December 2022: \u20ac 6,576 million) are generally recognized at the time of vehicle sale. In order to determine the extent of these provisions, assumptions have to be made concerning the type and extent of future warranty claims and goodwill cases, as well as on possible recall campaigns for each model series. These assessments are based on experience of the frequency and extent of vehicle faults and defects in the past. In addition, the estimates also include assumptions on the amounts of potential repair costs per vehicle and the effects of possible time or mileage limits. The provisions are regularly adjusted to reflect new information.\n\nVarious legal proceedings, claims and governmental investigations are pending against Mercedes-Benz Group AG and its subsidiaries on a wide range of topics. If the outcome of such legal proceedings is detrimental to the Mercedes-Benz Group, the Group may be required to pay substantial compensatory and punitive damages, to undertake service actions or recall campaigns, to pay fines or to carry out other costly actions. Litigation and governmental investigations often involve complex legal issues and are connected with a high degree of uncertainty. Accordingly, the assessment of whether an obligation exists on the balance sheet date as a result of an event in the past, and whether a future cash outflow is likely and the obligation can be reliably estimated, largely depends on estimations by the management. The Mercedes-Benz Group regularly evaluates the current stage of legal proceedings, also with the involvement of external legal counsel. It is therefore possible that the amounts of provisions for pending or threatened proceedings will have to be regularly restated due to new expected developments. As of 31 December 2023, the carrying amounts of provisions for liability and litigation risks are \u20ac 2,104 million (31 December 2022: \u20ac 2,755 million). Changes in estimates and assumptions can have a material effect on the Group's future profitability, liquidity and capial resources and financial position. It is also possible that provisions recognized for some legal proceedings may turn out to be insufficient once such\n\nCorporate GovernFurther Information Further Information",

The Mercedes-Benz Group may also become liable for payments in legal proceedings for which no provisions were established. Although the final resolution of any such proceedings could have a material effect on the Mercedes-Benz Group's earnings and cash flows for a particular reporting period, from the current assessment, the Mercedes-Benz Group does not expect this to result in any sustained impact on the Group's financial position.\n\nStatements\n\n## Pensions and similar obligations\n\n## Income taxes\n\nThe calculation of provisions for pensions and similar obligations and the related pension cost are based on various actuarial valuations. The calculations are subject to various assumptions on matters such as current actuarially developed probabilities (e.g. discount factors and cost-of-living increases), future fluctuations with regard to age and period of service, and experience with the probability of occurrence of pension payments, annuities or lump sums. As a result of changed market or economic conditions, the probabilities caused by the influencing factors may differ from current developments. The financial effects of deviations of the main factors are calculated with the use of sensitivity analyses. As of 31 December 2023 provisions for pensions and similar obligations are \u20ac 1,090 million (31 December 2022: \u20ac 1,021 million).\n\nThe calculation of income taxes of Mercedes-Benz Group AG and its subsidiaries is based on the legislation and regulations applicable in the various countries. Due to their complexity, the tax items presented in the Consolidated Financial Statements are possibly subject to different judgements by taxpayers on the one hand and local tax authorities on the other hand. Different judgements can occur especially in connection with the recognition and measurement of balance sheet items as well as in connection with the tax assessment of expenses and income. Carrying amount of liabilities for income taxes as of 31 December 2023 are \u20ac 2,421 million (31 December 2022: \u20ac 2,648 million).\n\nCorporate GovernFurther Information Further Information",

Consolidated subsidiaries and an equitymethod associated company were established for the charging activities of electric vehicles. The main disposals are described in the following sections.\n\n## Structured entities\n\nThe structured entities of the Group are mainly assetbacked-securities (ABS) companies and special funds. The ABS companies are primarily used for the Group's refinancing. The receivables transferred to structured entities usually result from the leasing and salesfinancing business. Those entities refinance the purchase price by issuing securities. The special funds are set up in particular in order to diversify the capitalinvestment strategy.\n\nAt the reporting date, the Group has business relationships with 34 (2022: 33) controlled structured entities, of which all are fully consolidated. In addition, as in the previous year the Group has relationships with one non-controlled structured entity.",

At the end of October 2022, the Mercedes-Benz Group signed contracts with the Russian car dealer Avtodom AO for the sale of the shares in the Russian subsidiaries.\n\nA degree of discretion has been exercised in the consideration and subsequent derivation of the effects of the sanctions and counter-sanctions on the business activities.\n\nThe recognition and valuation of the assets and liabilities due to the discontinuation of the business activities in Russia, in particular the processing of existing transactions, resulted in expenses of around \u20ac 0.7 billion in the automotive segments in 2022. Total expenses of around \u20ac 0.2 billion resulted from the measurement of credit default risks and increased refinancing expenses in the segment Mercedes-Benz Mobility. The bulk of the expenses were included in cost of sales.\n\nAs of 31 December 2022, completion of the transaction was still subject to authorities' approval and the implementation of the contractually agreed conditions.\n\nWith the closing of the transaction on 19 April 2023, the shares of Russian subsidiaries were deconsolidated.\n\nStatements\n\nThe sale of the Russian subsidiaries resulted in no significant cash inflow. This led to a cash outflow in the amount of the disposed cash and cash equivalents of \u20ac 91 million, which is mainly attributable to the Mercedes-Benz Mobility segment.\n\nThe assets of \u20ac 976 million disposed of with the deconsolidation essentially include property, plant and equipment of \u20ac 290 million and receivables from financial services of \u20ac 280 million. In addition, cash and cash equivalents of \u20ac 91 million are included. The disposed liabilities of \u20ac 1,065 million include in particular provisions of \u20ac 636 million and financing liabilities of \u20ac 347 million. The Group had issued a global guarantee for the financing liabilities to financial institutions, which ended when the transaction was completed. The contingent liabilities reported as of 31 December 2022 in connection with the cessation of business activities in Russia were also derecognized upon completion of the transaction.\n\nThe transaction costs amounted to \u20ac 3 million. After realizing the currency reserve of \u20ac 291 million, a loss on disposal of \u20ac 205 million resulted. This was reported in other operating expenses. Expenses of \u20ac 276 million were attributable to the Mercedes-Benz Mobility segment; the Mercedes-Benz Cars and Mercedes-Benz Vans segments generated income of \u20ac 66 million and \u20ac 5 million, respectively.\n\n## Sale of Daimler's commercial vehicle business\n\nWith the completion of the spin-off and hive-down of the Daimler commercial vehicle business substantial parts of the former Daimler commercial vehicle business including the associated financial services business were deconsolidated on 9 December 2021.\n\nThe initially remaining financial services of the Daimler commercial vehicle business were sold to Daimler Truck Holding AG or its subsidiaries in 2022. At the Mercedes-Benz Mobility segment, assets of \u20ac 3,191 million and liabilities of \u20ac 746 million were disposed of on or before 31 December 2022.\n\nIn addition, in individual countries, investments in operating entities or business operations of the former commercial vehicle business were sold to external third parties in 2022. Assets of \u20ac 149 million and liabilities of \u20ac 106 million, mainly allocated to the Mercedes-Benz Cars segment, were disposed of on or before 31 December 2022.\n\nThe Group received \u20ac 2,355 million from the (in the prior year partially still preliminary) purchase prices in 2022, including the repayment of the existing intraGroup financing liabilities of the companies and business activities within the Mercedes-Benz Group.\n\nThe valuation and sale and the transfer of the Mercedes-Benz Mobility companies resulted in net expenses of \u20ac 184 million in 2022 (excluding transaction\n\nCorporate GovernFurther Information Further Information",

Income of \u20ac 32 million was realized for the operating investments and business activities disposed of in 2022, in particular in the Mercedes-Benz Cars segment. In total, expenses from the realization of the currency reserve of \u20ac 58 million were recognized.\n\nIn 2023 there were no significant effects on the profitability, liquidity and capital resources, and financial position.\n\n## Sale of foreign retail activities and other sales companies\n\nAgreements on the sale of further sales activities in other European countries were concluded in 2023. The disposals are to take place successively over the course of 2024. The criteria for classification as assets and liabilities held for distribution or sale are met as of 31 December 2023. The assets of \u20ac 0.8 billion and liabilities of \u20ac 0.2 billion are therefore reported as assets and liabilities held for sale in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position of 31 December 2023 in accordance with IFRS 5. Of the assets, \u20ac 0.7 billion is attributable to the Mercedes-Benz Cars segment and \u20ac 0.1 billion to the Mercedes-Benz Vans segment. Assets mainly comprise inventories of \u20ac 0.3 billion, property, plant and equipment of \u20ac 0.2 billion and trade receivables of \u20ac 0.1 billion. The liabilities, which are almost entirely attributable to the Mercedes-Benz Cars segment, mainly include financing liabilities to financial institutions of \u20ac 0.1 billion.\n\nStatements\n\nIn January 2024, the Group divested its retail activities in Italy. There were no significant effects on the profitability, liquidity and capital resources, and financial position.\n\nThe sales company in Greece and other dealers in Europe were already sold in the course of 2023. The disposals resulted in income of \u20ac 186 million. The cash inflow amounted to a total of \u20ac 315 million. The effects are mainly allocated to the Mercedes-Benz Cars segment.\n\nIn addition, further retail activities in various countries, in particular those allocated to the Mercedes-Benz Cars segment, were sold in 2022. The disposals resulted in income of \u20ac 107 million and cash inflows of \u20ac 362 million.\n\nIn December 2021, the contractual arrangements on the sale of the retail activities in Canada were concluded. The transaction became effective in February 2022 and the Group recognized other operating income of \u20ac 514 million, which was mainly allocated to the Mercedes-Benz Cars segment. The cash inflow amounted to \u20ac 608 million and was also mainly allocated to the Mercedes-Benz Cars segment. Parts of the purchase price were financed by Mercedes-Benz Financial Services in Canada and led to a cash outflow of \u20ac 393 million at the Mercedes-Benz Mobility segment.\n\n## Sale of Indonesian sales and production entities\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz Group sold its subsidiaries in Indonesia to a local investor with effect from 29 September 2023. The sale of both companies resulted in an income of \u20ac 89 million and a cash inflow of \u20ac 140 million which are allocated to the Mercedes-Benz Cars segment. Assets decreased by \u20ac 141 million and liabilities by \u20ac 88 million as a result of deconsolidation.\n\nCorporate GovernFurther Information Further Information",

Some of the agreements concluded already took effect in 2021. When the other agreements became effective in January 2022, the Group lost control over MercedesBenz Grand Prix Ltd. and included the remaining 33.3% interest in the company in the Consolidated Financial Statements using the equity method. The sale of the shares resulted in other operating income of \u20ac 385 million in the Mercedes-Benz Cars segment in the first quarter of 2022. The purchase price payment agreed for 2023 resulted in a cash inflow of \u20ac 144 million.\n\nStatements\n\n## 4. Revenue\n\nRevenue according to IFRS 15 is disaggregated by the two categories - type of products and services and geographical regions. The category type of products and services corresponds to the reported segments.\n\nRevenue in 2023 was slightly above the previous year's level. The increase in revenue was primarily due to higher unit sales and improved pricing at the Mercedes-Benz Vans segment. Revenue in the MercedesBenz Cars segment was also higher, primarily due to a further improvement in pricing. However, negative exchange-rate effects had an opposing effect, causing a reduction in revenue.\n\nRevenue disclosed in the Consolidated Statement of Income includes revenue from contracts with customers, which are in the scope of IFRS 15 (revenue according to IFRS 15), and other revenue not in the scope of IFRS 15. The composition of the revenue in the Consolidated Statement of Income is shown by region in Note 34.\n\nRevenue according to IFRS 15 includes revenue that was included in contract liabilities at 31 December 2022 in an amount of \u20ac 2,903 million (2022: \u20ac 2,965 million) and revenue from performance obligations fully (or partially) satisfied in previous periods in an amount of \u20ac 467 million (2022: \u20ac 442 million). Revenue related to performance obligations that were unsatisfied (or partially unsatisfied) by the end of the reporting period that is expected to be recognized within three years amounted to \u20ac 6,663 million at 31 December 2023 (2022: \u20ac 6,437 million). This revenue is mainly derived from long-term service and maintenance contracts and extended warranties. It does not include performance obligations from customer contracts that have initial expected durations of one year or less. The number of vehicles, for which the expected original delivery time will exceed twelve months, was immaterial and is therefore not part of the disclosed amount. Long-term performance obligations of minor importance to the overall contract value of a bundled contract are not considered in assessing the initial duration of the bundled contract.\n\nCorporate GovernFurther Information Further Information",

In contrast, lower raw material prices had a positive impact on the cost of sales. Refinancing costs at Mercedes-Benz Mobility are rising due to higher interest rates compared to the previous year. In the prior year, cost of sales were impacted by expenses in connection with the discontinuation of the business activities in Russia.\n\nStatements\n\n## Personnel expenses and average number of employees\n\nPersonnel expenses included in the Consolidated Statement of Income for 2023 amounted to \u20ac 16,633 million (2022: \u20ac 16,501 million).

They are included in other miscellaneous expense.\n\nOther miscellaneous expense also includes expenses from hyperinflation accounting and other operating expense charged to third parties.\n\nThe loss of \u20ac 205 million from the deconsolidation of the shares in the Russian subsidiaries booked in other operating expense in 2023 is mainly attributable to the Mercedes-Benz Mobility segment.\n\nIn 2022, the valuation and disposal of operating investments and business activities of the Mercedes-Benz Mobility segment's commercial vehicle business included net expense of \u20ac 184 million (excluding transaction costs), which was reported in the reconciliation.",

The increase compared to the previous year is due, among other things, to the increase in tax-free equity-method earnings in 2023.\n\nThe other items include, among other things, effects from withholding taxes on dividends, patents and licenses which increased compared to the prior year.\n\nDeferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset if the deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and if there is the right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities. In the presentation of deferred tax assets and liabilities in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position, no difference is made between current and non-current.\n\nIn respect of each type of temporary difference and in respect of each type of unutilized tax-loss carryforwards and unutilized tax credits at 31 December, the deferred tax assets and liabilities presented in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position before offset are summarized in the following table.\n\nAt 31 December 2023, unrecognized deferred tax assets in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position relate, among other things, to corporate income tax-loss carryforwards and tax credits of \u20ac 83 million.\n\nThe following table shows the components of income tax expense.\n\n## Components of income tax expense\n\n|                                                               | 2023   | 2022   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| In millions of euros                                          |        |        |\n| Current taxes                                                 | -5,344 | -5,520 |\n| Deferred taxes                                                | -209   | 25     |\n| Deferred taxes due to temporary differences                   | -227   | 287    |\n| Deferred taxes due to tax-loss  carryforwards and tax credits | 18     | -262   |\n|                                                               | -5,553 | -5,495 |\n\nThe current tax expense includes tax benefits recognized for prior periods at German and foreign companies of \u20ac 341 million (2022: \u20ac 504 million).\n\nThe following table shows a reconciliation of expected income tax expense to actual income tax expense in the financial year. In order to determine the expected income tax expense, the German combined statutory tax rate of 29.825% applicable in the financial year is multiplied by the profit before taxes.",

The Group did not recognize deferred tax liabilities on retained earnings which are intended to be reinvested at non-German subsidiaries of \u20ac 27,529 million (2022: \u20ac 27,469 million). If those earnings were paid out as dividends, an amount of 5% would be taxed under German taxation rules and, if applicable, with non-German withholding tax. Additionally, other income tax consequences might arise if the dividends first have to be distributed by a non-German subsidiary to a non-German holding company. Normally, the distribution would lead to an additional income tax expense. Estimating the amount of taxable temporary differences for these undistributed foreign earnings would require a disproportionate effort.\n\nThe Group has various unresolved issues concerning open tax years. The Mercedes-Benz Group believes that it has recognized adequate liabilities for any future income taxes that may be owed for all open tax years. Nevertheless, it cannot be ruled out that tax payments might exceed the liabilities recognized in the financial statements.\n\nAs a result of future adjudications or changes in the opinions of the fiscal authorities, it cannot be ruled out that the Mercedes-Benz Group might receive tax refunds for previous years. In particular, from 2012 to 2021, Mercedes-Benz Group AG incurred currency exchange-rate related losses from the financing of Group companies based abroad totalling \u20ac 2.1 billion, which were compensated by corresponding hedging instruments. For the years until 2021, the German tax authorities consider that exchange-rate related losses from the financing of Group companies are generally not to be recognized, while the compensating profits from the hedging activities remain taxable. In 2021, the German Modernization of Corporate Income Tax Act stipulated that such exchange-rate losses are generally deductible. However, this only applies from 2022 onwards. The Company does not share the legal opinion represented by the tax authorities for the years up to 2021. In the meantime, a lawsuit has also been filed with the Finance Court.",

Intangible assets\n\nIntangible assets developed as shown on the following page.\n\nAt 31 December 2023, goodwill of \u20ac 389 million (2022: \u20ac 389 million) relates to the Mercedes-Benz Mobility segment, goodwill of \u20ac 335 million (2022: \u20ac 337 million) relates to the Mercedes-Benz Cars segment and goodwill of \u20ac 21 million (2022: \u20ac 23 million) relates to the Mercedes-Benz Vans segment.\n\nNon-amortizable intangible assets primarily relate to goodwill and development costs for projects which have not yet been completed (carrying amount at 31 December 2023: \u20ac 6,131 million; 2022: \u20ac 4,496 million). The increase in capitalized development costs is mainly due to development services for the new platform generations geared to electromobility. In addition, other intangible assets with a carrying amount of \u20ac 262 million (2022: \u20ac 190 million) are not amortizable. These non-amortizable intangible assets are distribution rights in the vehicle segments with indefinite useful lives.

Its product portfolio comprises light-, medium- and heavy-duty trucks, city buses and intercity buses, coaches and bus chassis. In addition financial services aligned to the product portfolio are offered. The investment is reported in the reconciliation of the reportable segments of the Group.\n\nThe result in financial year 2023 amounted to \u20ac 797 million (2022: \u20ac 226 million). In 2022, the earnings included income of \u20ac 59 million from the contribution of approximately 5% of the shares in Daimler Truck to the Mercedes-Benz Pension Trust.\n\nWith the approval of the Supervisory Board, the Board of Management of Daimler Truck resolved a share buyback programme on 10 July 2023. The acquisition of the treasury shares on the stock exchange began on 2 August 2023. During the share buyback programme, the Mercedes-Benz Group did not sell any of its Daimler Truck shares. The shareholding remains unchanged 30.00%, while a shareholding of 30.66% is assumed for the development of the equity-method carrying amount as of 31 December 2023. In June 2023, the Annual General Meeting of Daimler Truck resolved a dividend of \u20ac 1.30 per share. The distribution led to a cash inflow of \u20ac 321 million and reduced the carrying amount of the investment accordingly.\n\nStatements\n\n## Beijing Benz Automotive Co., Ltd.\n\n## There Holding B.V.\n\nBeijing Benz Automotive Co., Ltd. (BBAC) produces and distributes Mercedes-Benz cars and spare parts in China. The investment and the proportionate share in the results of BBAC are allocated to the Mercedes-Benz Cars segment.\n\nIn the second quarter of 2023, the shareholders of BBAC resolved the distribution of a dividend of \u20ac 903 million. A further distribution of \u20ac 767 million was resolved in the fourth quarter of 2023. The distributions reduced the shareholding's carrying amount and caused a cash inflow of \u20ac 1,595 million.\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz Group plans to contribute additional equity of approximately \u20ac 0.2 billion in accordance with the shareholding ratio at BBAC.\n\nThere Holding B.V. (THBV) owns shares of HERE International B.V. (HERE). HERE is one of the world's largest manufacturers of digital road maps for navigation systems. The high-resolution maps provide one of the foundations for autonomous driving. THBV is accounted for as an associated company in the Consolidated Financial Statements of Mercedes-Benz Group AG using the equity method and is assigned to the Mercedes-Benz Cars segment.\n\nAs part of a strategic realignment and refinancing of HERE, the Mercedes-Benz Group, along with other shareholders of the associated company THBV, contributed additional equity of \u20ac 118 million into THBV through Mercedes-Benz AG in the first half of 2023. The capital increases led to a corresponding increase in the equity-method carrying amount. The funds from the capital injection were transferred by THBV to HERE in order to increase HERE's liquidity.\n\nThe strategic repositioning led to a reassessment of the business development of HERE in the second quarter of 2023. Due to this THBV recognized an impairment on the carrying amount of HERE. The proportionate expenses attributable to the Group from the impairment of \u20ac 92 million are included in the line item gains/losses on equity-method investments and reported in the Mercedes-Benz Cars segment.",

Receivables from financial services\n\n## Types of receivables\n\nReceivables from sales financing with customers include receivables from credit financing for non-Group third parties who purchased their vehicle either from a dealer or directly from the Mercedes-Benz Group.\n\nStatements\n\nReceivables from sales financing with dealers represent loans for floor financing programmes for vehicles purchased from the Mercedes-Benz Group. In addition, these receivables also relate to the financing of other assets that the dealers purchased from third parties, in particular used vehicles or property.\n\nReceivables from finance lease contracts consist of receivables from leasing contracts for which all substantial risks and rewards incidental to the leasing objects are transferred to the lessee.\n\nIn 2023, the Mercedes-Benz Group recognized a gain of \u20ac 538 million (2022: \u20ac 177 million) from the difference between the additions to receivables from finance lease contracts and the carrying amounts of the underlying assets.\n\nAt 31 December 2023, receivables from financial services with a carrying amount of \u20ac 11,139 million (2022: \u20ac 11,931 million) were pledged mostly as collateral for liabilities from ABS transactions (see also Note 24).\n\n## Receivables from financial services\n\n|                                | At 31 December  2023   | At 31 December  2023   | At 31 December  2023   | At 31 December  2022   | At 31 December  2022   | At 31 December  2022   |\n|--------------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|\n|                                | Current  Non-current   | Current  Non-current   | Total                  | Current  Non-current   | Current  Non-current   | Total                  |\n| In millions of euros           |                        |                        |                        |                        |                        |                        |\n| Sales financing with customers | 17,578                 | 31,940                 | 49,518                 | 19,188                 | 32,223                 | 51,411                 |\n| Sales financing with dealers   | 14,261                 | 4,824                  | 19,085                 | 11,198                 | 3,504                  | 14,702                 |\n| Finance lease contracts        | 6,744                  | 12,781                 | 19,525                 | 7,009                  | 12,296                 | 19,305                 |\n| Residual-value receivables     | 302                    | 836                    | 1,138                  | 439                    | 890                    | 1,329                  |\n| Gross carrying amount          | 38,885                 | 50,381                 | 89,266                 | 37,834                 | 48,913                 | 86,747                 |\n| Loss allowances                | -416                   | -639                   | -1,055                 | -522                   | -676                   | -1,198                 |\n| Net carrying amount            | 38,469                 | 49,742                 | 88,211                 | 37,312                 | 48,237                 | 85,549                 |",

Over the contract terms, the amounts of the collaterals are included in the calculation of the risk provisioning, so the net carrying amounts of the credit-impaired contracts are essentially backed by the underlying vehicles.\n\nFurther information on loss allowances, financial risks and types of risks is provided in Note 33.\n\n## Loss allowances\n\nThe loss allowances for receivables from financial services due to expected credit losses are shown in the table Development of loss allowances for receivables from financial services due to expected credit losses.\n\nThe carrying amounts of receivables from financial services based on modified contracts that are shown in stages 2 and 3, amounted to \u20ac 463 million at 31 December 2023 (2022: \u20ac 223 million). In addition, carrying amounts of \u20ac 86 million in connection with contractual modifications were reclassified at 31 December 2023 from stages 2 and 3 into stage 1 (2022: \u20ac 135 million).\n\n## Credit risks\n\nInformation on credit risks included in receivables from financial services is shown in the table Credit risks included in receivables from financial services.\n\nLonger overdue periods regularly lead to higher loss allowances.",

Equity\n\n## Share capital\n\nThe share capital (authorized capital) is \u20ac 3,070 million at 31 December 2023, unchanged compared to 31 December 2022. It is still divided into 1,070 million nopar-value shares. All shares are fully paid up. Each nopar-value share confers the right to one vote at the Annual General Meeting of Mercedes-Benz Group AG and, if applicable, with the exception of any new shares potentially not entitled to dividends, to an equal portion of the profits as defined by the dividend distribution decided upon at the Annual General Meeting. Each share represents a proportionate amount of approximately \u20ac 2.87 of the share capital.\n\nThe number of shares issued on 31 December 2023 was 1,070 million, the same as on 31 December 2022 and unchanged since 1 January 2022.\n\nThe number of shares outstanding decreased by 29 million shares to 1,041 million shares as at 31 December 2023, compared to 31 December 2022 (1,070 million shares) due to the share buyback programme that has been running since March 2023. The number of shares outstanding had remained unchanged at 1,070 million between 1 January 2022 and 31 December 2022.\n\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nStatements\n\n## Approved capital\n\nThe Annual General Meeting held on 3 May 2023 authorized the Board of Management again to increase the share capital by up to a total of \u20ac 1.0 billion by 2 May 2028 with the approval of the Supervisory Board against cash and/or non-cash contributions (Approved Capital 2023). The authorization enables the exclusion of shareholders' subscription rights under certain conditions and within defined limits subject to the consent of the Supervisory Board.\n\nNo use has been made of the Approved Capital 2018, for which the authorization period ended on 4 April 2023, and no use has been made of the Approved Capital 2023 to date.\n\n## Conditional capital\n\nBy resolution of the Annual General Meeting on 8 July 2020, the Board of Management is authorized, with the consent of the Supervisory Board, until 7 July 2025 to issue convertible and/or warrant bonds or a combination of these instruments ('bonds') with a total face value of up to \u20ac 10.0 billion and a maturity of no more than ten years. The Board of Management is allowed to grant the holders of these bonds conversion or warrant rights for new registered no-par-value shares in Mercedes-Benz Group AG with an allocable portion of the share capital of up to \u20ac 500 million in accordance with the details defined in the terms and conditions of the bonds. The bonds can be offered in exchange for cash\n\nand/or non-cash contributions, in particular for shares in other companies. The terms and conditions of the bonds can include warranty obligations or conversion obligations. The bonds can be issued once or several times, wholly or in instalments, or simultaneously in various tranches as well as by subsidiaries of the Company within the meaning of Sections 15 et seq. of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG). Among other things, the Board of Management was also authorized to exclude shareholders' subscription rights for the bonds under certain conditions and within defined limits subject to the consent of the Supervisory Board.\n\nIn order to fulfil the conditions of the above-mentioned authorization, the Annual General Meeting on 8 July 2020 also resolved to increase the share capital conditionally by an amount of up to \u20ac 500 million (Conditional Capital 2020).\n\nNo use was made of this authorization to issue convertible and/or warrant bonds during the reporting period.\n\nCorporate GovernFurther Information Further Information",

The shares can be used, among other things, with the exclusion of shareholders' subscription rights, for business combinations or to acquire companies or to be sold to third parties for cash at a price that is not significantly lower than the stock-exchange price of the Company's shares. The acquired shares can also be used to fulfil obligations from issued convertible bonds and/or bonds with warrants and to be issued to employees of the Company and employees and board members of the Company's subsidiaries pursuant to Sections 15 et seq. of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG). The treasury shares can also be cancelled.\n\nIn a volume up to 5% of the share capital issued as of the day of the resolution of the Annual General Meeting, the Board of Management is authorized, with the consent of the Supervisory Board, to acquire treasury shares also by using derivatives (put options, call options, forward purchases or a combination of these instruments), whereby the term of a derivative must not exceed 18 months and must not end later than 7 July 2025.\n\nStatements\n\n## Share buyback programmes\n\nto fund share buybacks with the purpose of redeeming shares.\n\nOn the basis of the authorization to acquire the Company's own shares given by the Annual General Meeting on 8 July 2020, the Board of Management, with the approval of the Supervisory Board, resolved a share buyback programme on 16 February 2023. The acquisition of treasury shares worth up to \u20ac 4 billion (not including incidental costs) on the stock exchange over a period of up to two years began on 3 March 2023. The repurchased shares are to be cancelled at a later date. Mercedes-Benz Group AG has separately agreed with Beijing Automotive Group Co., Ltd. and Geely Group that they will each keep their share in all voting shares of Mercedes-Benz Group AG below 10% by divesting their shares on a pro-rata basis concurrently with the share buyback programme.\n\nFrom March to December 2023, as part of the share buyback programme, 29 million of the Company's own shares were repurchased at a purchase price of \u20ac 1,887 million, representing \u20ac 83 million or 2.70% of the share capital. The purchase price was recorded under treasury shares together with a liability of \u20ac 369 million for buyback obligations.\n\nOn 21 February 2024, Mercedes-Benz Group AG has resolved to implement a share buyback policy. Based on such policy, the future Free Cash Flow from the industrial business (as available post potential smallscale M&A) generated beyond the approximately 40% dividend payout ratio of Group net profit shall be used\n\nIn this context, Mercedes-Benz Group AG moreover has resolved to conduct a further share buyback programme, through which it is intended to acquire own shares worth up to \u20ac 3 billion (not including incidental costs) on the stock exchange and to then cancel them. The further share buyback programme will be based on the authorization by the Annual General Meeting of Mercedes-Benz Group AG on 8 July 2020, authorizing the Board of Management to acquire, with the approval of the Supervisory Board, own shares up to a maximum of 10% of the share capital until 7 July 2025. It is scheduled to commence immediately after the conclusion of the ongoing share buyback programme announced on 16 February 2023, and is expected to be completed before the expiry of the Annual General Meeting's above-mentioned authorization.\n\nFuture share buyback programmes are subject to the necessary resolutions of the company's corporate bodies required in each individual case.\n\nCorporate GovernFurther Information Further Information",

The purchase was carried out without utilizing the authorization to acquire treasury shares granted by the Annual General Meeting on 8 July 2020. The shares, which were reissued to group employees, were purchased for a price of \u20ac 66 million and represented \u20ac 2.7 million or 0.09% of the share capital (2022: 0.7 million shares of Mercedes-Benz Group AG representing \u20ac 1.9 million or 0.06% of the share capital were purchased for a price of \u20ac 48 million).\n\n## Capital reserves\n\nCapital reserves primarily comprise premiums arising on the issue of shares as well as expenses relating to the exercise of the up to 2014 exercisable stock option plans and the issue of employee shares, effects from changes in ownership interests in consolidated entities and directly attributable related transaction costs.\n\nStatements\n\nposed for allocation to retained earnings is attributable to 28.9 million treasury shares not entitled to dividends held directly or indirectly by the company on 31 December 2023. As the number of treasury shares held directly or indirectly by the Company will change before the Annual General Meeting due to the ongoing share buyback programme, a proposal for a correspondingly adjusted resolution will be submitted to the Annual General Meeting. With an unchanged dividend of \u20ac 5.30 per no-par-value share entitled to a dividend the portion of the distributable profit to be transferred into retained earnings and the total distribution amount will be adjusted accordingly.\n\n## Retained earnings\n\nRetained earnings comprise the accumulated net profits and losses of all companies included in MercedesBenz Group's Consolidated Financial Statements, less any profits distributed.

Share-based payment\n\nThe details shown in the table do not represent any paid or committed remuneration, but refer to expenses calculated according to IFRS.\n\nAt 31 December 2023, the Group has the 2020-2023 Performance Phantom Share Plans (PPSP) outstanding. As instruments of share-based payment with cash settlement, the PPSP are measured at their fair values on the balance sheet date. They are paid out at the end of their contractually defined periods; an earlier, proportionate payout is only possible under certain conditions when a beneficiary leaves the company. PPSP 2019 was paid out as planned in the first quarter of 2023.\n\nMoreover, 50% of the annual bonus of the members of the Board of Management is paid out after a waiting period of one year. The actual payout is determined by the development of Mercedes-Benz Group shares compared to an automobile-related index (AutoSTOXX). The fair value of this medium-term annual bonus, which depends on that development, is measured by using the intrinsic value at the reporting date.\n\nThe pre-tax effects of share-based payment arrangements for the executives of the Group and the members of the Board of Management of Mercedes-Benz Group AG on the Consolidated Statement of Income and Consolidated Statement of Financial Position are shown in the following table.\n\n## Effects of share-based payment\n\n|                                                                                     |       |        | Provision  At 31 December   | Provision  At 31 December   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------|--------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|\n|                                                                                     | 2023  | 2022   | 2023                        | 2022                        |\n| In millions of euros                                                                |       |        |                             |                             |\n| PPSP                                                                                | 248   | 233    | 596                         | 654                         |\n| thereof PPSP of the                                                                 |       |        |                             |                             |\n| members of the                                                                      |       |        |                             |                             |\n| Board of Manage-                                                                    |       |        |                             |                             |\n| ment                                                                                | 16    | 17     | 36                          | 43                          |\n| Medium-term  component of annual  bonus of the members  of the Board  of Management | 8 256 | 8  241 | 15 611                      | 15  669                     |",

During the four-year period between the allocation of the preliminary phantom shares and the payout of the plan after the end of the term, the phantom shares earn a dividend equivalent to the amount of the actual dividend paid on real Mercedes-Benz Group shares in the respective year. The amount of cash paid after the end of the holding period is based on the final number of vested phantom shares (determined after three years according to the degree of target achievement of specific performance indicators) multiplied by the quoted price of the Mercedes-Benz Group's ordinary shares (calculated as an average price over a specified period after the end of the four-year plan period). The vesting period is therefore four years. For the existing plans, the quoted price of the phantom shares to be used for the payout is limited to 2.5 times the phantom share price at the date of grant. Furthermore, in the case of the plans PPSP 2020 to 2022, the payout for the members of the Board of Management is also limited to 2.5 times the allotment value used to determine the preliminary number of phantom shares. The limitation of the payout for the members of the Board of Management also includes the dividend equivalents.\n\nStatements\n\nFor the issued PPSP 2020 to 2022, the degree of target achievement is determined on the basis of the relative share performance, which measures the performance development of the Mercedes-Benz Group share compared with the development of a performance index based on a group of competitors including the Mercedes-Benz Group, and the return on sales (RoS) of the Mercedes-Benz Group compared with the average revenue-weighted RoS of a group of competitors. PPSP 2023 includes environmental, social and governance (ESG) targets in the achievement of objectives in order to promote the sustainable realignment and long-term, sustainable development of the Group. From PPSP 2023, overall target achievement will be determined based on the weighted achievement of the financial targets (relative share performance and RoS) and the ESG targets over the three-year performance period. The achievement of the financial targets accounts for 80% and the achievement of the ESG targets for 20% of the overall target achievement of the PPSP.\n\nIn the case of plans PPSP 2020 to 2022, special rules apply for the members of the Board of Management: the Mercedes-Benz Group's RoS must be not only equal to but higher than that of the competitors in order to obtain the same target achievement as the other plan participants. Furthermore, an additional limit on target achievement was agreed upon for the reference parameter RoS for the members of the Board of Management. In the case of target achievement between 195% and 200%, an additional comparison is made on the basis of the RoS achieved in absolute\n\nterms. If the actual RoS for the automotive business is below the strategic target in the third year of the performance period, target achievement is limited to 195%.\n\nThe Group recognizes a provision for awarding the PPSP in the Provisions for other risks in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position. Since payment per vested phantom share depends on the quoted price of Mercedes-Benz Group's share, that quoted price essentially represents the fair value of each phantom share at the balance sheet date. The proportionate remuneration expenses from the PPSP recognized in the individual years are measured based on the price of Mercedes-Benz Group shares and the estimated target achievement.",

The defined benefit pension plans provided by the Group generally vary according to the economic, tax and legal circumstances of the country concerned. Most of the defined benefit pension commitments also provide benefits in the case of invalidity and death.\n\n## Pension plans and pension plan assets\n\nMost employees in Germany have defined benefit pension commitments; most of the pension commitments for the active workforce are based on individual retirement benefit accounts, to which the Company makes annual contributions. The amount of the contributions for non-exempt employees depends on the tariff classification in the respective year or on their respective income; for executives it depends on their respective income. For the commitments to retirement benefits made prior to 2011, the contributions continue to be converted into capital components and credited to the individual pension accounts with the application of fixed factors related to each employee's age. The conversion factors include a fixed value increase. For the commitments to retirement benefits made as of 2011, the Company guarantees at a minimum the value of the contributions paid into a cash-balance plan. Pension\n\nIn addition, previously concluded defined benefit plans exist which primarily depend on employees' wage-tariff classification upon transition into the benefit phase and which foresee a life annuity.\n\nAs well as the employer-financed pension plans granted by German companies, the employees of some companies are also offered various earningsconversion models.\n\nMost of the pension obligations in Germany relating to defined benefit pension commitments are funded by investment funds. Contractual trust arrangements (CTA) exist between Mercedes-Benz Group AG as well as some subsidiaries in Germany and the MercedesBenz Pension Trust e. V. The Mercedes-Benz Pension Trust e. V. acts as a collateral trust fund.\n\nIn 2018, Mercedes-Benz Group AG transferred certain pension obligations and plan assets of retired employees and their survivors to Mercedes-Benz Pensionsfonds AG (previously Daimler Pensionsfonds AG; pension fund). These benefits are administrated by that non-insurance-like pension fund, which falls under the scope of the Act on the Supervision of Insurance Undertakings and is therefore subject to the oversight of the Federal Financial Supervisory Agency (BaFin).",

Accordingly, the committed benefits are intended to contribute to additional financial security during retirement, and in the case of death or invalidity to be capable of being planned and fulfilled by the respective company of the Group and to have a lowrisk structure. In addition, a committee exists that approves new pension plans and amendments to existing pension plans as well as policies relating to company retirement benefits.\n\nThe obligations from defined benefit pension commitments and the pension plan assets can be subject to fluctuations over time. This can have a negative or a positive effect on the funded status. Fluctuations in the defined benefit pension obligations result at the Mercedes-Benz Group in particular from changes in financial assumptions such as discount rates and increases in the cost of living, but also from changes in demographic assumptions such as adjusted life expectancies. With most of the German plans, expected longterm wage and salary increases do not have an impact on the amount of the obligation.\n\nStatements\n\nThe fair value of the plan assets is predominantly determined by the situation on the capital markets. Unfavourable developments, especially of equity prices and fixed-interest securities, could reduce that fair value. The diversification of investment funds, the engagement of asset managers using quantitative and qualitative analyses, and the continual monitoring of performance and risk help to reduce the associated investment risk. As long as the commitments of the defined benefit pension plans remain overfunded by the plan assets, the Mercedes-Benz Group will only make additional pension contributions when legally and economically necessary.\n\nAs a general principle, it is the Group's objective to design new pension commitments as defined benefit plans based on capital components or on contributions, or as defined contribution plans.\n\nCorporate GovernFurther Information Further Information",

Most of the bonds have investment grade ratings. They include government bonds of very good creditworthiness.\n\nThe investment strategy is reviewed regularly and adjusted if deemed necessary. The investment strategy is determined by Investment-Committees, which are generally composed of representatives of the Finance and Human Resources departments. The investment strategy for the pension plan assets is generally oriented towards the structure of the pension obligations.\n\n## Pension costs\n\nThe components of pension costs included in the Consolidated Statement of Income are shown in the following table.\n\n## Pension costs\n\n|                                                  | 2023   | 2022   |\n|--------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| In millions of euros                             |        |        |\n| Current service cost                             | -351   | -522   |\n| Past service cost,  curtailments and settlements | -      |        |\n| Net interest expense                             | -23    | -45    |\n| Net interest income                              | 32     | 12     |\n|                                                  | -342   | -554   |\n\n1\n\n## Measurement assumptions\n\nThe measurement date for the defined benefit pension obligations and plan assets is generally 31 December. The measurement date for the periodic pension cost is generally 1 January. The assumptions used to calculate the defined benefit obligations vary according to the economic conditions of the countries in which the pension plans are situated.\n\nCalculation of the pension obligations uses life expectancy for the German plans based on the Heubeck 2018 G mortality tables. Comparable country-specific calculation methods are used for international plans.",

For most international plans, expected increases in cost of living do not have a material impact on the amount of the obligation.\n\n## Sensitivity analysis\n\nThe calculations carried out by actuaries were done in isolation for the evaluation parameters regarded as important. This means that if there is a simultaneous change in several parameters, the individual results cannot be summed due to correlation effects. With a change in the parameters, the sensitivities shown cannot be used to derive a linear development of the defined benefit obligation.\n\nStatements\n\n## Effect on future cash flows\n\nFor the year 2024, the Group plans to make contributions of \u20ac 0.1 billion to the plan assets; the final amount is usually set in the fourth quarter of a year. The pensions benefits paid are expected to amount to \u20ac 1.1 billion in 2024.\n\nThe weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligations amounts to 13 years (2022: 13 years).\n\n## Defined contribution pension plans\n\nUnder defined contribution pension plans, the Mercedes-Benz Group makes defined contributions to external insurance policies or investment funds. There are fundamentally no further contractual obligations or risks for the Mercedes-Benz Group in excess of the defined contributions. The Group also pays contributions to governmental pension schemes. In 2023, the total costs from defined contribution plans amounted to \u20ac 1.0 billion (2022: \u20ac 1.0 billion). Of those payments, \u20ac 1.0 billion (2022: \u20ac 1.0 billion) was related to state pension plans.\n\nAn increase or decrease in the main actuarial assumptions would have the following effects on the present value of the defined benefit pension obligations.\n\n## Sensitivity analysis for the present value of defined benefit obligations\n\n|                                       | At 31 December       | At 31 December       | At 31 December       |\n|---------------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|----------------------|\n|                                       |                      | 2023                 | 2022                 |\n| In millions of euros                  | In millions of euros | In millions of euros | In millions of euros |\n| Sensitivity to                        |                      |                      |                      |\n| discount rates                        | + 0.25%              | -617                 | -569                 |\n| discount rates                        | - 0.25%              | 649                  | 597                  |\n| expected increases  in cost of living | + 0.10%              | 58                   | 54                   |\n| expected increases  in cost of living | - 0.10%              | -58                  | -53                  |\n| life expectancy                       | + 1 year             | 359                  | 304                  |\n| life expectancy                       | - 1 year             | -320                 | -271                 |\n\nCalculation of the sensitivity of life expectancy by means of fixed (non-age-dependent) factors for a reference person results in a life expectancy one year higher or one year lower.",

Provisions for other risks\n\n## Product warranties\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz Group issues various types of product warranties, under which it generally guarantees the performance of products delivered and services rendered for a certain period. The provision for these product warranties covers expected costs for legal and contractual warranty claims as well as expected costs for goodwill concessions and recall campaigns. This also includes measures relating to Mercedes-Benz diesel vehicles in various regions as well as recalls, in particular for an extended recall of Takata airbags. The utilization date of product warranties depends on the incidence of the warranty claims and can span the entire term of the product warranties and the goodwill period. The cash outflows in relation to non-current provisions are primarily expected within a period until 2026.\n\nStatements\n\n## Other\n\nProvisions for other risks primarily comprise expected costs for provisions for environmental protection, other taxes and charges related to income taxes as well as obligations from outstanding commission. They also include provisions for anticipated losses on pending transactions and various other risks which cannot be allocated to any other class of provision.\n\n## Personnel and social costs\n\nProvisions for personnel and social costs primarily comprise expected expenses of the Group for employee anniversary bonuses, profit-sharing bonuses for non-exempt employees and variable remuneration for management as well as early-retirement and partialretirement plans. The additions recorded to the provisions for profit-sharing bonuses and variable remuneration in the reporting year usually result in cash outflows in the following year. The cash outflows for noncurrent provisions for personnel and social costs are primarily expected within a period until 2032.\n\n## Liability and litigation risks and regulatory proceedings\n\nProvisions for liability and litigation risks and regulatory proceedings comprise costs for various legal proceedings, claims and governmental investigations, which can lead in particular to payments of compensation, punitive damages or other costly actions. They primarily include risks from litigation and regulatory proceedings in relation to Mercedes-Benz diesel vehicles. The cash outflows in relation to non-current provisions are primarily expected within a period until 2026.\n\nFurther information on liability and litigation risks and regulatory proceedings is provided in Note 30.",

Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows\n\n## Calculation of funds\n\nAt 31 December 2023, cash and cash equivalents included restricted funds of \u20ac 91 million (2022: \u20ac 187 million). The restricted funds representing cash and cash equivalents were related to subsidiaries where foreign exchange controls apply, so that the Group has restricted access to the funds.\n\n## Cash flow from operating activities\n\nOther operating assets and liabilities changed as follows.\n\n## Changes in other operating assets and liabilities\n\n|                                            | 2023   | 2022   |\n|--------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| In millions of euros                       |        |        |\n| Provisions                                 | 487    | 355    |\n| Financial instruments                      | -55    | -104   |\n| Miscellaneous other assets and liabilities | 1,192  | 107    |\n|                                            | 1,624  | 358    |\n\nStatements\n\nThe increase in miscellaneous other assets and liabilities compared with the previous year was primarily related to miscellaneous other financial assets, liabilities from accrued interest and deferred income.\n\nIn the prior year, significant positive effects resulted from assets in connection with the securitization of receivables and from contractual liabilities for price discounts. This was partially offset by lower negative effects in miscellaneous other financial liabilities and the contract liabilities for service and maintenance agreements.\n\nThe other non-cash expense and income shown in the reconciliation of profit before income taxes to cash flow from operating activities in the reporting year primarily comprised the Group's share of gains/losses on equity-method investments and the result from the fair value measurement of debt instruments.\n\nThe following cash flows are included in Cash flow from operating activities.\n\n## Cash flows included in Cash flow from operating activities\n\n|                                                    | 2023   | 2022   |\n|----------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| In millions of euros                               |        |        |\n| Interest paid                                      | -306   | -486   |\n| Interest received                                  | 630    | 231    |\n| Dividends received from  equity-method investments | 2,056  | 1,605  |\n| Dividends received from other  shareholdings       | 307    | 130    |\n\nIn the previous year, this item was affected in particular by the Group's share in the gains/losses on equitymethod investments, the result from the fair value measurement of equity instruments and the result of the remeasurement of the shares of Mercedes-Benz Grand Prix Ltd., that the Mercedes-Benz Group continues to hold. In addition, the other non-cash expense and income was impacted by the depreciation of the remaining financial services volumes of the Daimler commercial vehicle business, sold to Daimler Truck Holding AG or its subsidiaries in 2022.",

Legal proceedings\n\n## Diesel emission behaviour: governmental proceedings\n\nMercedes-Benz Group AG and its subsidiaries are confronted with various legal proceedings, claims as well as governmental investigations and orders (legal proceedings) on a large number of topics, including vehicle safety, emissions, fuel economy, financial services, dealer, supplier and other contractual relationships, intellectual property rights (including but not limited to patent infringement actions), warranty claims, environmental matters, antitrust matters (including actions for damages) as well as investor litigation. Productrelated litigation involves, among other things, claims alleging faults in vehicles. Some of these claims are asserted by way of class actions. If the outcome of such legal proceedings is detrimental to the MercedesBenz Group or such legal proceedings are settled, the Group may encounter substantial financial burdens, e.g. from damages payments or service actions, recall campaigns, monetary penalties or other costly actions, which would adversely affect the earnings of Mercedes-Benz Group AG. Legal proceedings and related settlements may also have an impact on the company's reputation.\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz Group is continuously subject to governmental information requests, inquiries, investigations, administrative orders and proceedings relating to various laws and regulations in connection with diesel exhaust emissions.\n\nThe corresponding activities of various authorities worldwide, which were already reported in the past, are partly ongoing, as described below. These activities particularly relate to test results, the emission control systems used in Mercedes-Benz diesel vehicles and/or the interactions of the Mercedes-Benz Group with the relevant authorities as well as related legal issues and implications, including, but not limited to, under applicable environmental, criminal, consumer protection and antitrust laws.\n\nIn the United States, Mercedes-Benz Group AG and Mercedes-Benz USA, LLC (MBUSA) reached agreements in the third quarter of 2020 with various authorities to settle civil environmental claims regarding the emission control systems of certain diesel vehicles. These agreements have become final and effective. The authorities took the position that the Mercedes-Benz Group had failed to disclose Auxiliary Emission Control Devices (AECDs) in certain of its US diesel vehicles and that several of these AECDs were illegal defeat devices.",

The failure to meet certain of those obligations may trigger additional stipulated penalties. In the first quarter of 2021, the MercedesBenz Group paid the civil penalties; provisions have been recognized for the emission modification programme and other measures.\n\nAs already reported, in April 2016, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) requested that the Mercedes-Benz Group conduct an internal investigation. The MercedesBenz Group conducted such an internal investigation in cooperation with the DOJ's investigation; the DOJ's investigation remains open. In addition, further US state authorities have opened investigations pursuant to both local environmental and consumer protection laws and have requested documents and information.\n\nStatements\n\nIn Canada, the environmental regulator Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC) is conducting an investigation in connection with diesel exhaust emissions based on the suspicion of potential violations of, amongst others, the Canadian Environmental Protection Act, as well as undisclosed AECDs and defeat devices. The Mercedes-Benz Group continues to cooperate with the investigating authorities.\n\nIn Germany, the Stuttgart public prosecutor's office issued a fine notice against Mercedes-Benz in September 2019 based on a negligent violation of supervisory duties, thereby concluding the related administrative offense proceedings against Mercedes-Benz. In July 2021, the local court of B\u00f6blingen issued penal orders against three Mercedes-Benz employees based on, amongst others, fraud, which have become final. The criminal investigation proceedings of the Stuttgart public prosecutor's office against further Mercedes-Benz employees on the suspicion of, amongst others, fraud have meanwhile been discontinued.\n\nBetween 2018 and 2020, the German Federal Motor Transport Authority (KBA) issued subsequent auxiliary provisions for the EC type approvals of certain Mercedes-Benz diesel vehicles, and ordered mandatory recalls as well as, in some cases, stops of the first registration. In autumn 2022 and in December 2023, the KBA issued further decisions regarding vehicles equipped with various EU6 or EU5 diesel engines. In each of those cases, it held that certain calibrations of specified functionalities are to be qualified as imper-\n\nmissible defeat devices. Mercedes-Benz has a contrary legal opinion on this question and has filed timely objections against the KBA's administrative orders and determinations mentioned above. Insofar as the KBA has not remedied the objections, Mercedes-Benz has filed lawsuits with the competent administrative court to have the controversial questions at issue clarified in a court of law. Irrespective of such objections and the lawsuits that are now pending, the Mercedes-Benz Group continues to cooperate fully with the KBA. To a large extent, the remedial actions requested by the KBA were developed by the Mercedes-Benz Group and assessed and approved by the KBA; the necessary recalls were initiated. For some of the vehicles affected by the KBA's decision from December 2023, developments, examinations and approvals of the remedial measures are still pending. It cannot be ruled out that under certain circumstances, software updates may have to be reworked, or further delivery and registration stops may be ordered or resolved by the company as a precautionary measure, also with regard to the used car, leasing and financing businesses. In the course of its regular market supervision, the KBA routinely conducts further reviews of Mercedes-Benz vehicles and asks questions about technical elements of the vehicles. In addition, the Group continues to be in a dialogue with the German Federal Ministry for Digital and Transport (BMDV) to conclude the analysis of the diesel-related emissions matter and to further the update of affected customer vehicles. In light of the aforementioned administrative orders issued by the KBA, and continued discussions with the KBA and the\n\nCorporate GovernFurther Information Further Information",

Since 1 September 2020, this also applies to other responsible authorities of other member states and the European Commission, which conduct market surveillance under the new European Type Approval Regulation and can take measures upon assumed non-compliance, irrespective of the place of the original type approval, and also to the British market surveillance authority DVSA (Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency).\n\nIn addition to the aforementioned authorities, authorities of various foreign states, particularly the South Korean Ministry of Environment and the South Korean competition authority (Korea Fair Trade Commission) are conducting various investigations and/or procedures in connection with diesel exhaust emissions. In this context, these South Korean authorities have made determinations and imposed sanctions against Mercedes-Benz which Mercedes-Benz has appealed. In the same context, national antitrust authorities of various countries are also conducting investigations, including the South Korean antitrust authority, which has made certain findings and imposed fines on some car manufacturers. In February 2024, the criminal proceeding in South Korea was concluded.\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz Group continues to fully cooperate with the authorities and institutions.\n\nStatements\n\n## Diesel emission behaviour: consumer actions and other lawsuits in the United States, Germany and other states\n\nIn a lawsuit filed by the Environmental Protection Commission of Hillsborough County, Florida in September 2020, the plaintiff claimed that, amongst others, Mercedes-Benz Group AG and MBUSA had violated municipal regulations prohibiting vehicle tampering and other conduct by using alleged devices claimed to impair the effectiveness of emission control systems. The lawsuit was dismissed in the third quarter of 2022. The plaintiff's appeal to this decision was dismissed in the third quarter of 2023. The decision is final, and the proceedings are concluded.\n\nConsumer class actions were filed against MercedesBenz Group AG in Israel in February 2019 as well as against Mercedes-Benz Group AG and further Group companies in the United Kingdom since May 2020, in the Netherlands since June 2020, in Portugal as well as since November 2022 in Australia. The plaintiffs inter alia assert that the Mercedes-Benz Group had used devices that impermissibly impair the effectiveness of emission control systems in reducing nitrogen-oxide (NOx) emissions and which cause excessive emissions from vehicles with diesel engines. Furthermore, they claim that Mercedes-Benz Group AG deceived consumers in connection with advertising Mercedes-Benz diesel vehicles. The proceedings in England and Wales\n\nconsist of several individual lawsuits that have been consolidated into a class action. A class action lawsuit is also pending in Scotland. In these proceedings, allegedly injured parties must actively register for the enforcement of claims (opt-in). The plaintiffs in the consumer class action in England and Wales also allege, among other things, anti-competitive behaviour relating to technology for the treatment of diesel exhaust emissions.\n\nIn Germany, a large number of customers of diesel vehicles have filed lawsuits for damages or rescission of sales contracts. They assert that the vehicles contained illegal defeat devices and/or showed impermissibly high emission or consumption values. They refer in particular to the KBA's recall orders (see above). Although the number of pending cases is declining, a future increase cannot be ruled out. Based on similar allegations, the Federation of German Consumer Organizations (Verbraucherzentrale Bundesverband e. V.) filed a model declaratory action (Musterfeststellungsklage) against Mercedes-Benz Group AG with the Stuttgart Higher Regional Court in July 2021. Such an action seeks a ruling that certain preconditions of alleged consumer claims are met. Following a decision of the European Court of Justice in the first quarter of 2023, the German Federal Court of Justice ruled in the second quarter of 2023 that vehicle purchasers are entitled to claim damages against the manufacturer if it intentionally or negligently used an inadmissible defeat device.",

The investors allege that Mercedes-Benz Group AG did not immediately disclose inside information in connection with the emission behaviour of its diesel vehicles and that it had made false and misleading public statements. They further claim that the purchase price of the financial instruments acquired by them (in particular Mercedes-Benz Group shares, formerly Daimler AG shares) would have been lower if Mercedes-Benz Group AG had complied with its disclosure obligations. Mercedes-Benz Group AG regards these allegations and claims as being without merit and will defend itself against them. In this context, the Stuttgart Higher Regional Court initiated model case proceedings under the German Act on Model Case Proceedings in Disputes under Capital Markets Law (KapMuG) in December 2021 (model case proceedings). The purpose of the model case proceedings is to reach a decision that is binding for the main proceedings regarding common factual and legal questions. The main proceedings before the Stuttgart Regional Court will be suspended until a decision is reached on the questions submitted, insofar as they cannot be dismissed independently of the questions to be decided\n\nStatements\n\nin the model case proceedings. The decision in the model case proceedings is binding for the suspended main proceedings. Multiple investors have used the possibility to register claims in a considerable amount with the model case proceedings in order to suspend the period of limitation. Mercedes-Benz Group AG remains of the view to have duly fulfilled its disclosure obligations under capital markets law and defends itself against the investors' allegations also in these model case proceedings.\n\n## Accounting assessment of the legal proceedings in connection with diesel emission behaviour\n\nWith respect to the legal proceedings described in the two preceding chapters, in accordance with IAS 37.92 no further information is disclosed with respect to whether, or to what extent, provisions have been recognized and/or contingent liabilities have been disclosed, so as not to prejudice the Mercedes-Benz Group's position. For recognized provisions, this does not apply to the extent that a settlement has been reached or a proceeding has been concluded.\n\n## Other legal proceedings\n\nStarting in July 2017, a number of class action suits were filed in the United States and Canada against Mercedes-Benz Group AG and other manufacturers of automobiles as well as a number of their North American subsidiaries. Plaintiffs allege to have suffered damages because defendants engaged in anticompetitive behaviour relating to vehicle technology, costs, suppliers, markets, and other competitive attributes, including diesel emissions control technology, since the 1990s. In June 2022, the proceedings in the United States were dismissed with final effect in favour of the concerned Mercedes-Benz Group companies. Furthermore, in 2023, several class actions in Canada were finally dismissed as the plaintiffs discontinued their claims. The Mercedes-Benz Group also expects the",

This development leads to a material reduction of the risk associated with the class actions. They therefore no longer qualify for separate reporting, which is why the Mercedes-Benz Group will no longer report on them in the future.\n\nAs already reported, class actions in connection with Takata airbags are pending in the United States, Canada and Israel. The lawsuits are based on allegations that, along with Takata entities and many other companies that sold vehicles equipped with Takata airbag inflators, Mercedes-Benz Group companies and others were allegedly negligent in selling such vehicles, purportedly not recalling them quickly enough, and failing to warn consumers about a potential defect and/or to provide an adequate replacement airbag inflator. One of the lawsuits in the United States also asserted claims by automotive recyclers who alleged injury because they were not able to re-sell salvaged airbag inflators that are subject to the Takata recall. This claim has since then been finally dismissed. Also, the remaining consumer class action in the United States was dismissed against Mercedes-Benz Group AG in its entirety, and against MBUSA in part. The plaintiffs have appealed the dismissal of Mercedes-Benz Group AG and the proceedings against MBUSA are still pending. Since February 2023, the class actions in Canada were discontinued by the plaintiffs; one of the class actions was finally dismissed and the formal court dismissal for the other class action is still pending. Mercedes-Benz\n\nStatements\n\nGroup AG continues to regard the pending claims as being without merit, and the affected Group companies will continue to defend themselves against the claims. Contingent liabilities were disclosed to a low extent for this topic.\n\nIn October 2021, a number of Australian MercedesBenz dealers lodged a claim against Mercedes-Benz Australia/Pacific Pty Ltd (MBAuP) with a Federal Court in Australia. They allege that MBAuP forced the dealers to accept a change in their business model from a dealership model to an agency model and thus deprived them of the goodwill they created through their investments in the Australian Mercedes-Benz dealership network. They seek reinstatement of the dealership model or, alternatively, compensation for the damage they allegedly incurred. In August 2023, the court dismissed the claims in their entirety. In January 2024, the plaintiffs appealed the decision. MBAuP considers those claims to be without merit and continues to defend itself against the claims.\n\nSince 2022, a class action has been pending in the United States alleging claims based on a voluntary recall of certain Mercedes-Benz ML-, GL- and R-Class vehicles produced during the 2004-2015 model years for potentially corroded brake boosters. Among other things, the plaintiffs allege that the brake boosters in such vehicles can corrode and lead to reduced braking force. They allege failure to disclose the claimed defect and assert various claims. A similar class action was filed in Israel. The Mercedes-Benz Group considers the lawsuits to be without merit and defends itself against them.",

Such provisions are recognized in the Group's Consolidated Financial Statements and are based on estimates. If quantifiable, contingent liabilities in connection with legal proceedings are disclosed in the Group's Consolidated Financial Statements. Risks resulting from legal proceedings sometimes cannot be assessed reliably or only to a limited extent. Consequently, provisions recognized for some legal proceedings may turn out to be insufficient once such proceedings have ended. The MercedesBenz Group may also become liable for payments in legal proceedings for which no provisions were recognized and/or contingent liabilities were disclosed. Uncertainty exists with regard to the amounts or due dates of possible cash outflows. Although the final result of any such proceedings could materially affect the Group's operating results and cash flows for a particular reporting period, the Mercedes-Benz Group believes that it should not exert a sustained influence on the Group's financial position.\n\nStatements\n\n## 31. Contingent liabilities and other financial obligations\n\nIn addition, the Mercedes-Benz Group issued irrevocable loan commitments at 31 December 2023. These loan commitments had not been utilized as of that date. Further information with respect to these irrevocable loan commitments is provided in Note 33.\n\n## Contingent liabilities\n\nAt 31 December 2023, the best estimate for obligations from contingent liabilities was \u20ac 2,553 million (2022: \u20ac 4,122 million). The other contingent liabilities are mainly related to the legal proceedings and product warranties described in Note 30. Compared to the previous year, the decrease in contingent liabilities is a result of discontinuing the business activities in Russia and the disposal of contingent liabilities with the realization of the transaction.\n\n## Other financial obligations\n\nAt 31 December 2023, other financial obligations exist from the acquisition of intangible assets, property, plant and equipment and lease property of \u20ac 5,684 million (2022: \u20ac 5,729 million).",

Financial instruments\n\n## Carrying amounts and fair values of financial instruments\n\nThe table Carrying amounts and fair values of financial instruments shows the carrying amounts and fair values of the respective classes of the Group's financial instruments and contain the Group amounts, including assets and liabilities held for sale. The fair values of financial instruments were calculated on the basis of market information available on the balance sheet date. The following methods and assumptions were used.\n\n## Receivables from financial services\n\nThe fair values of receivables from financial services with variable interest rates are estimated to be equal to the respective carrying amounts, because the agreed upon interest rates and those available in the market do not significantly differ. The fair values of receivables from financial services with fixed interest rates are determined on the basis of discounted expected future cash flows. Discounting is based on the current interest rates at which similar loans with identical terms could have been obtained at 31 December 2023 and 31 December 2022.\n\nStatements\n\nMarketable debt securities and equity instruments recognized at fair value were measured using quoted market prices at the end of the reporting period. If quoted market prices are not available for these debt and equity instruments, fair value measurement is based on inputs that are either directly or indirectly observable in active markets. Fair values are calculated using recognized financial valuation models such as discounted cash flow models or multiples.\n\nOther financial assets recognized at fair value through profit or loss relate to derivative financial instruments not used in hedge accounting. These financial instruments as well as derivative financial instruments used in hedge accounting comprise:\n\n- -derivative currency hedging contracts; the fair values of cross-currency interest rate swaps are determined on the basis of the discounted estimated future cash flows (taking account of credit premiums and default risks) using the market interest rates appropriate to the remaining terms of the financial instruments. The measurement of currency forwards is based on market quotes of forward curves. Currency options are measured with option-pricing models using market data.\n- -derivative interest rate hedging contracts; the fair values of interest rate hedging instruments (e.g. interest rate swaps) are calculated on the basis of the discounted estimated future cash flows (taking account of credit premiums and default risks) using the\n\n## Trade receivables and cash and cash equivalents\n\nDue to the short terms and the fundamentally lower credit risk of these financial instruments, it is assumed that their fair values are equal to the carrying amounts.\n\n## Marketable debt securities and similar investments, other financial assets\n\nMarketable debt securities are recognized at fair value through other comprehensive income or at fair value through profit or loss. Similar investments are measured at amortized cost and are not included in the measurement hierarchy, as their carrying amounts are a reasonable approximation of fair value due to the short terms of these financial instruments and the fundamentally low credit risk.\n\nEquity instruments are recognized at fair value through other comprehensive income or at fair value through profit or loss. Equity instruments recognized at fair value through other comprehensive income are included in the table Carrying amounts and fair values of financial instruments and primarily comprise the shares in Sila Nanotechnologies Inc., Momenta Global Limited and Aston Martin Lagonda Global Holdings Plc. The remaining investments recognized at fair value through other comprehensive income comprise further investments not material on an individual basis.",

The fair values of bonds, loans, commercial paper, deposits in the direct banking business and liabilities from ABS transactions are calculated as present values of the estimated future cash flows (taking account of credit premiums and credit risks). Market interest rates for the appropriate terms are used for discounting.\n\nStatements\n\n## Trade payables\n\nDue to the short maturities of these financial instruments, it is assumed that their fair values are equal to the carrying amounts.\n\nReverse factoring agreements did not change the relevant characteristics of a trade payable for the Group for the liabilities concerned. As a result, there were no reclassifications of these trade payables to financing liabilities.\n\n## Contract and refund liabilities\n\nContract and refund liabilities include obligations from sales transactions that qualify as financial instruments. Obligations from sales transactions should generally be regarded as current. Due to the short maturities of these financial instruments, it is assumed that their fair values are equal to the carrying amounts.\n\n## Other financial liabilities\n\nFinancial liabilities recognized at fair value through profit or loss comprise derivative financial instruments not used in hedge accounting. For information regarding these financial instruments as well as derivative financial instruments used in hedge accounting, see the notes above under Marketable debt securities and similar investments, other financial assets.\n\nMiscellaneous other financial liabilities are carried at amortized cost.

These are mainly currency risks; interest rate risks and commodity price risks, which have been defined as risk categories. For these hedging purposes, the Group mainly uses currency forward transactions, cross-currency interest rate swaps, interest rate swaps, options and commodity forwards.\n\nStatements\n\nThe following table shows the amounts for the transactions designated as hedging instruments.\n\nMost of the transactions for which the effects from the measurement of the hedging instrument and the underlying transaction to a large extent offset each other in the Consolidated Statement of Income were mostly not included in the hedge accounting.\n\nEven if derivative financial instruments do not or no longer qualify for hedge accounting, these instruments still serve to hedge financial risks from business operations. A hedging instrument is terminated when the hedged transaction no longer exists or is no longer expected to occur.\n\nExplanations of the hedging of exchange-rate risks, interest rate risks and commodity price risks can be found in Note 33 in the sub-item Finance market risk.\n\n## Amounts for the transactions designated as hedging instruments\n\n|                                            | Currency risk  Cash flow hedges\u00b9   | Currency risk  Cash flow hedges\u00b9   |      |       | Interest rate risk  Fair-value hedges\u00b2   | Interest rate risk  Fair-value hedges\u00b2   | Commodity price risk  Cash flow hedges\u00b9   | Commodity price risk  Cash flow hedges\u00b9   |\n|--------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|------|-------|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|\n| In millions of euros                       | 2023                               | 2022                               | 2023 | 2022  | 2023                                     | 2022                                     | 2023                                      | 2022                                      |\n| Carrying amount of the hedging instruments |                                    |                                    |      |       |                                          |                                          |                                           |                                           |\n| Other financial assets current             | 904                                | 442                                | 100  | 23    | 33                                       | 2                                        | 1                                         | 1                                         |\n| Other financial assets non-current         | 760                                | 456                                | 858  | 1,539 | 4                                        | -                                        | -                                         | -                                         |\n| Other financial liabilities current        | 265                                | 629                                | 7    | 7     | 45                                       | 36                                       | -                                         | -                                         |\n| Other financial liabilities non-current    | 181                                | 376                                | 44   | 44    | 573                                      | 1,191                                    | -                                         | -                                         |\n| Fair value changes\u00b3                        | 1,877                              | 1,321                              | -628 | 1,334 | 625                                      | -1,820                                   | -                                         | 5                                         |\n\n- 1 Includes the following hedging instruments: currency forwards, currency options, currency swaps and commodity forwards.\n- 2  Includes the following hedging instruments: interest rate swaps, cross-currency interest rate swaps.\n- 3  Gains and losses from hedging instruments used for recognizing hedge ineffectiveness.",

The guidelines and systems are regularly reviewed and adjusted to changes in markets and products.\n\n## 33. Management of financial risks\n\n## General information on financial risks\n\nAs a result of its businesses and the global nature of its operations, the Mercedes-Benz Group is exposed to market risks from changes in foreign currency exchange-rates and interest rates, while price risks arise from the procurement of raw materials and energy, for example. An equity price risk results from investments in listed companies. In addition, the Group is exposed to credit risks from its leasing and mainly financing activities and from its business operations (trade receivables). Furthermore, the Group is exposed to country and liquidity risks relating to its credit and market risks or a deterioration of its business operations or financial market disturbances. If these financial risks materialize, they could adversely affect the Group's profitability, liquidity and capital resources and financial position.\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz Group has established internal policies for risk controlling procedures and for the use of financial instruments, including a clear segregation of duties with regard to financial activities, settlement, accounting and the related controlling. The guidelines upon which the Group's risk management processes for financial risks are based are designed to identify and analyse these risks throughout the Group, to set ap-\n\nThe Group manages and monitors these risks primarily through its operating and financing activities and, if required, through the use of derivative financial instruments. The Mercedes-Benz Group uses derivative financial instruments exclusively for hedging financial risks that arise from its business operations or refinancing activities or liquidity management. Without these derivative financial instruments, the Group would be exposed to higher financial risks. Additional information on financial instruments and especially on the volumes of the derivative financial instruments used is included in Note 32. The Mercedes-Benz Group regularly evaluates its financial risks with due consideration of changes in key economic indicators and up-to-date market information.",

See Note 22 for additional information on the Mercedes-Benz Group's pension and post-employment healthcare benefits.\n\n## Credit risk\n\nCredit risk describes the risk of financial loss resulting from a counterparty failing to meet its contractual payment obligations. Credit risk encompasses both the direct risk of default and the risk of a deterioration of creditworthiness as well as concentration risks.\n\nThe maximum risk positions of financial assets which are generally subject to credit risk are equal to their carrying amounts at the balance sheet date (without consideration of collateral, if available). There is also a risk of default from irrevocable loan commitments which had not been utilized as of that date, as well as from financial guarantees. The maximum risk position in these cases is equal to the expected future cash outflows.\n\nStatements\n\nThe following table shows the maximum risk positions at the balance sheet date.\n\n## Maximum risk positions of financial assets,\n\n## irrevocable loan commitments and financial guarantees 1\n\n|                              |      | Maximum risk position   | Maximum risk position   |\n|------------------------------|------|-------------------------|-------------------------|\n|                              | Note | 2023                    | 2022                    |\n| In millions of euros         |      |                         |                         |\n| Liquid assets                |      | 22,830                  | 24,739                  |\n| Receivables from             |      |                         |                         |\n| financial services           | 14   | 88,211                  | 85,549                  |\n| Trade                        |      |                         |                         |\n| receivables                  | 19   | 7,419                   | 8,100                   |\n| Derivative financial         |      |                         |                         |\n| instruments used in          |      |                         |                         |\n| hedge accounting             |      |                         |                         |\n| (assets only)                | 32   | 2,660                   | 2,463                   |\n| Derivative financial         |      |                         |                         |\n| instruments not used in      |      |                         |                         |\n| hedge accounting             |      |                         |                         |\n| (assets only)                | 32   | 347                     | 584                     |\n| Other receivables and        |      |                         |                         |\n| financial assets             | 32   | 3,013                   | 3,113                   |\n| Irrevocable loan commitments |      | 2,476                   | 3,234                   |\n| Financial guarantees         |      | 284                     | 551                     |\n\n- 1 The maximum exposure information presented in the table refers to Group amounts, including assets and liabilities held for sale.\n\n## Liquid assets\n\nLiquid assets consist of cash and cash equivalents and marketable debt securities and similar investments. With the investment of liquid assets, banks and issuers of securities are selected very carefully and diversified in accordance with a limit system. Liquid assets are mainly held at financial institutions within and outside Europe with high creditworthiness, as bonds issued by German federal states and as money market funds. In connection with investment decisions, priority is placed on the borrower's very high creditworthiness and on balanced risk diversification. The limits and their utilization are reassessed continuously. In this assessment, the Mercedes-Benz Group also considers the credit risk assessment of its counterparties by the capital markets. In line with the Group's risk policy, most liquid assets are held in investments with an external rating of 'A' or better. Liquid assets are thus not subject to a material credit risk and are allocated to stage 1 of the impairment model under IFRS, which is based on expected credit risk.",

As a consequence of these activities, the Group is exposed to credit risk, which is monitored and managed based on defined standards, guidelines and procedures. The MercedesBenz Group manages its credit risk irrespective of whether it is related to a financing contract or to an operating lease or a finance lease contract. For this reason, statements concerning the credit risk of Mercedes-Benz Mobility refer to the entire financing and leasing business, unless otherwise specified.\n\nExposure to credit risk from financing and lease activities is monitored based on the portfolio subject to credit risk. The portfolio subject to credit risk consists of wholesale and retail receivables from financial services and the portion of the operating lease portfolio that is subject to credit risk. Receivables from financial services comprise claims arising from finance lease contracts and repayment claims from financing loans. The operating lease portfolio is reported under equipment on operating leases in the Group's Consolidated Statement of Financial Position. Lease payments due from operating lease contracts are recognized in receivables from financial services.\n\nStatements\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz Mobility segment has policies setting the framework for effective risk management at a global as well as a local level. In particular, these policies deal with minimum requirements for all riskrelevant credit processes, the definition of financing products offered, the evaluation of customer quality, requests for collateral and the treatment of unsecured loans and non-performing claims. The limitation of concentration risks is implemented primarily by means of global limits, which refer to customer exposures. To comply with these limits, Mercedes-Benz Mobility applies approval standards and measures to avoid concentration risks. Only one customer was granted a credit line in the form of a large loan. The MercedesBenz Mobility portfolio consists of a large number of small and medium-sized enterprises and private customers from more than 30 countries. At 31 December 2023, this segment accounted for 72% of the portfolio.\n\nWith respect to its financing and lease activities, the Group holds collateral for customer transactions limiting actual credit risk through its fair value. The value of collateral generally depends on the amount of the financed assets. The financed vehicles usually serve as collateral. Furthermore, Mercedes-Benz Mobility limits credit risk from financing and lease activities, for example through deposits from customers.\n\nFor the assessment of the default risk of retail and small business customers, scoring systems are applied to evaluate their creditworthiness. Corporate customers are evaluated using internal rating instruments. Both evaluation processes use external credit bureau data if available. The scoring and rating results as well as the availability of security and other risk mitigation instruments, such as deposits, guarantees and, to a lesser extent, residual debt insurances, are essential elements for credit decisions.\n\nCorporate GovernFurther Information Further Information",

Internal restructuring policies and practices for loan and leasing contracts are based on the indicators or criteria which, in the judgement of local management, indicate that repayment will probably continue and that the total proceeds expected to be derived from the renegotiated contract exceed the expected proceeds to be derived from immediate repossession and remarketing. In the case of receivables from financial services, significant modifications of financial assets were only made in rare cases and to an insignificant extent.\n\nThe allowance ratio decreased compared to the previous year due to the sale of the Russian Mercedes-Benz Mobility companies for which very high provisions were recorded in 2022. The default rate has increased compared to the very low figures in the previous year, mainly due to a challenging lending environment in the United States.\n\nStatements\n\nFor information on credit risks included in receivables from financial services, see Note 14. Information on the measurement of expected credit losses is provided in Note 1.\n\n## Trade receivables\n\nTrade receivables are mostly receivables from worldwide sales of vehicles and spare parts. The credit risk from trade receivables encompasses the default risk of customers, e.g. dealers and general distribution companies, as well as other corporate and private customers. In order to identify credit risks, the Mercedes-Benz Group assesses the creditworthiness of customers. The Mercedes-Benz Group manages its credit risk from trade receivables using appropriate IT applications and databases on the basis of internal policies which have to be followed Group-wide.\n\nA significant proportion of the trade receivables from each country's domestic business is secured by various country-specific types of collateral. This collateral includes conditional sales, guarantees and sureties, as well as mortgages and deposits from customers.\n\nFor trade receivables from the export business, the Mercedes-Benz Group also evaluates its customers' creditworthiness by means of an internal rating process with consideration of the respective country risk.\n\nIn this context, the Annual Financial Statements and other relevant information on the general distribution companies, such as payment history, are used and assessed.\n\nDepending on the creditworthiness of the customers, the Mercedes-Benz Group establishes credit limits and limits credit risks with the following types of collateral:\n\n- -credit insurances,\n- -first-class bank guarantees and\n- -letters of credit.\n\nThese procedures are defined in the export credit guidelines, which have Group-wide validity.\n\nFor impairments of trade receivables, the simplified approach is applied, according to which these receivables are allocated to stage 2. Credit losses until maturity for these trade receivables are recognized upon initial recognition.\n\nFurther information on trade receivables and the status of loss allowances recognized is provided in Note 19.",

The Mercedes-Benz Group manages its credit risk exposure in connection with derivative financial instruments through a limit system, which is based on the review of each counterparty's financial strength. This system limits and diversifies the credit risk. As a result, the Mercedes-Benz Group is exposed to credit risk only to a small extent with respect to its derivative financial instruments. In accordance with the Group's risk policy, most derivatives are contracted with counterparties which have an external rating of 'A' or better.\n\n## Other receivables and financial assets\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz Group is exposed to credit risk only to a small extent with respect to other receivables and financial assets included in other financial assets in 2023 and 2022.\n\nStatements\n\n## Country risk\n\nCountry risk is the risk of economic loss arising from changes of political, economic, legal or social conditions in the respective country, e.g. resulting from sovereign measures such as expropriation or interdiction of foreign currency transfers.\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz Group is exposed to country risk mainly resulting from cross-border funding or collateralization of Group companies and customers, from investments in Group companies, associated companies, joint ventures and joint operations as well as from cross-border trade receivables. Country risks also arise from cross-border cash deposits at financial institutions.\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz Group manages these risks via country exposure limits (e.g. for hard currency portfolios of financial services entities). An internal rating system serves as a basis for the Mercedes-Benz Group's risk-oriented country exposure management; it assigns all countries to risk classes, with consideration of both external ratings and capital market indications of country risks.\n\n## Irrevocable loan commitments\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz Mobility segment in particular is exposed to credit risk from irrevocable loan commitments to end customers and retailers. At 31 December 2023, irrevocable loan commitments amounted to \u20ac 2,476 million (2022: \u20ac 3,234 million). These loan commitments had a maturity of less than one year and are not subject to a material credit risk based on the current state of knowledge.\n\n## Financial guarantees\n\nThe maximum potential obligations resulting from financial guarantees amounted to \u20ac 284 million at 31 December 2023 (2022: \u20ac 551 million) and included liabilities recognized at 31 December 2023 in the amount of \u20ac 4 million (2022: \u20ac 7 million). Financial guarantees represent contractual arrangements. These guarantees generally provide that in the event of default or nonpayment by the primary debtor, the Group will be required to settle such financial obligations generally up to a contractually agreed amount.",

Additionally, the possibility to securitize receivables of the financial services business (ABS transactions) also reduces the Group's liquidity risk. Liquid assets comprise cash and cash equivalents and marketable debt securities and similar investments. The Group can dispose of these liquid assets at short notice.\n\nInsofar as reverse factoring agreements are entered into, they have no influence on the liquidity risk of the Mercedes-Benz Group, as they relate to a large number of investors and have no impact on the payment terms of the trade payables concerned.\n\nThe funds raised are used to finance working capital and capital expenditure as well as the cash needs of the leasing and sales-financing business and unexpected liquidity needs. In accordance with internal policies, the refunding of the leasing and salesfinancing business is generally carried out with matching maturities so that financing liabilities have the same maturity profile as the equipment on operating leases and the receivables from financial services.\n\nStatements\n\nAt 31 December 2023, the liquidity of the MercedesBenz Group amounted to \u20ac 22.8 billion (2022: \u20ac 24.7 billion). In 2023, significant cash inflows resulted from the business of the Mercedes-Benz Cars and Mercedes-Benz Vans segments. Furthermore, dividends received from Daimler Truck Holding AG and Beijing Benz Automotive Co., Ltd. in particular had a positive effect on liquidity. Cash outflows resulted in particular from investments in intangible assets and property, plant and equipment, income taxes paid, the dividend payment to the shareholders of Mercedes-Benz Group AG and payments made as part of the share buyback programme. Moreover, there were negative effects from the leasing and sales financing business at Mercedes-Benz Mobility.\n\nFrom an operating point of view, the management of the Group's liquidity exposures is centralized by a daily cash-pooling process. This process enables the Mercedes-Benz Group to manage its liquidity surplus and liquidity requirements according to the actual needs of the Group and of the companies of the Group. The Group's short-term and mid-term liquidity management takes into account the maturities of financial assets and financial liabilities and estimates of cash flows from business operations.\n\nIn general, the Mercedes-Benz Group makes use of a broad spectrum of financial instruments to cover its funding requirements. Depending on funding requirements and market conditions, the Mercedes-Benz Group issues commercial papers, bonds (including green bonds), debt obligations and financial instruments secured by receivables in various currencies. Bank credit facilities are also used to cover financing requirements. Potential downgrades of the MercedesBenz Group's credit ratings could have a negative impact on the Group's financing. Since July 2018, the Mercedes-Benz Group has had at its disposal a syndicated credit facility with a volume of \u20ac 11 billion from a consortium of international banks. It grants the Mercedes-Benz Group additional financial flexibility until 2025. The credit line was unused as of 31 December 2023. In addition, customer deposits at Mercedes-Benz Bank are used as a further source of refinancing.\n\nInformation on the Group's financing liabilities is also provided in Note 24.\n\nCorporate GovernFurther Information Further Information",

The Group is also exposed to equity price risk in connection with its investments in listed companies.\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz Group manages market risks to minimize the impact of fluctuations in foreign exchange-rates and interest rates on the earnings of the Group and its segments. The Group calculates its overall net-exposure to these market risks to provide the basis for hedging decisions, which include the selection of hedging instruments and the determination of hedging volumes and the corresponding periods. The hedging strategy is specified at Group level and uniformly implemented in the segments. Decisions regarding, for example, currencies and asset-liability management (interest rates) are made by a committee that meets regularly. Net-exposures are the basis for the hedging strategies and are updated regularly. The MercedesBenz Group usually counteracts the risk of short-term fluctuations in raw-material prices by means of price escalation clauses in the supply contracts. Power purchase agreements are also concluded to reduce electricity price risks. Power purchase agreements are purchase agreements for energy needs, including fixed purchase prices of the electricity generated by a specific plant for generating wind or solar power.\n\nStatements\n\nCertain existing benchmark interest rates including those of the London Interbank Offered Rate (for USD, GBP, CHF and JPY) were comprehensively and internationally reformed. As a result, those interest rates were gradually abolished and replaced with alternative riskfree reference rates. Alternative interest rates were developed on a national level in the context of the respective legal systems and currencies; they can therefore vary with regard to their structure, methodology and period of publication.\n\nAs the reform for EURIBOR and USD, GBP, CHF and JPY LIBOR has already been implemented, the contractual adjustment of financial instruments has already been made in line with a corresponding interest rate reference.\n\nThe conversion of the outstanding reference rates of hedging instruments and their underlying transactions was identical and without any material delay. The Mercedes-Benz Group considered the economic relationship and thus the continuation of hedge accounting to be still existing as of 31 December 2022.\n\nThe nominal values of those hedging instruments that were affected in the prior year and are included in a hedging relationship can be found in table Nominal amounts of derivative financial instruments used in hedge accounting in Note 32.\n\nThe effect of the application of the new interest rates on the Consolidated Financial Statements is being reviewed on an ongoing basis. In order to conduct financial transactions based on the new indices, the Mercedes-Benz Group is preparing its relevant IT-systems accordingly. Uncertainty still exists about future market standards with interest conventions for individual financial products (cash products and interest derivatives) that reference the new risk-free rates. Contracts not yet converted as part of the IBOR reform in the previous year (USD LIBOR) amounted to \u20ac 4,790 million in financial liabilities and \u20ac 9,258 million in derivatives as of 31 December 2022.\n\nAs part of its risk management system, the MercedesBenz Group employs value-at-risk analyses. In performing these analyses, the Mercedes-Benz Group quantifies its market risk due to changes in foreign currency exchange-rates and interest rates and certain commodity prices on a regular basis by predicting the potential loss over a target time horizon (holding period) and confidence level.",

The value-at-risk calculation method for commodity hedging instruments is based on a Monte Carlo simulation.\n\nWhen calculating value at risk using the variancecovariance approach, the Mercedes-Benz Group first computes the current market value of the Group's financial instruments portfolio. Then the sensitivity of the portfolio value to changes in the relevant market risk factors, such as particular foreign currency exchange-rates or interest rates of specific maturities, is quantified. Based on volatilities and correlations of these market risk factors, which are obtained from the RiskMetrics\u2122 dataset, a statistical distribution of potential changes in the portfolio value at the end of the holding period is computed. The loss which is reached or exceeded with a probability of only 1% can be derived from this calculation and represents the value at risk.\n\nStatements\n\nThe Monte Carlo simulation uses random numbers to generate possible changes in market risk factors consistent with current market volatilities. The changes in market risk factors allow the calculation of a possible change in the portfolio value over the holding period. Running multiple iterations of this simulation leads to a distribution of portfolio value changes. The value at risk can be determined based on this distribution as the portfolio value loss which is reached or exceeded with a probability of 1%.\n\n## Exchange-rate risk\n\n## Transaction risk and currency risk management\n\nThe global nature of the Mercedes-Benz Group's businesses exposes cash flows to risks arising from fluctuations in exchange-rates. These risks primarily relate to fluctuations between the euro and the US dollar, the Chinese renminbi, the British pound and other currencies such as currencies of growth markets. In the operating vehicle business, the Group's exchange-rate risk primarily arises when revenue is generated in a currency that is different from the currency in which the costs of revenue are incurred (transaction risk). It may be inadequate to cover the costs if the value of the currency in which the revenue is generated declined in the interim relative to the value of the currency in which the costs were incurred. The risk exposures serve as a basis for analysing exchange-rate risks at Group level. In addition, the Group is indirectly exposed to a transaction risk from its equity-method investments.\n\nThe Group's overall currency exposure is reduced by natural hedging, which consists of the currency exposures of the business operations of different entities and segments partially offsetting each other at Group level. These natural hedges eliminate the need for hedging to the extent of the matched exposures. To provide an additional natural hedge against any remaining transaction risk exposure, the Mercedes-Benz Group generally strives to increase cash outflows in the same currencies in which the Group has a net excess inflow.\n\nIn order to mitigate the impact of currency exchangerate fluctuations for the business operations (future transactions), the Mercedes-Benz Group continually assesses its exposure to exchange-rate risks and hedges a portion of those risks by using derivative financial instruments. A committee manages the Group's exchange-rate risk and its hedging transactions through currency derivatives. The committee consists of representatives of the relevant segments and corporate functions. The Corporate Treasury department aggregates foreign currency exposures from the companies of the Group and the operational units and implements the committee's decisions concerning foreign currency hedging through transactions with international financial institutions. Suitable measures are generally taken without delay to eliminate any over-hedging regarding hedging transactions caused by changes in exposure. Moreover, designated hedging relationships are reviewed with respect to any requirements to discontinue hedge accounting.",

Depending on the nature of the underlying risks, the hedging rates decrease the further the expected cash flows are in the future. On the one hand, the hedging horizon is naturally limited by uncertainty related to cash flows that lie far in the future; on the other hand, it may also be limited by the fact that appropriate currency contracts are not available. This step-by-step method aims to limit risks for the Group from unfavourable movements in exchange-rates while preserving sufficient flexibility to participate in favourable developments. Based on this step-by-step method and depending on the market outlook, the committee determines the hedging horizon, which usually varies from one to five years, as well as the average hedge ratios. At the end of 2023, the currency management for calendar year 2024 showed an unhedged position in the automotive business of 35% of the underlying forecasted cash flows in US dollars and an unhedged position of 29% of the underlying forecast cash flows in British pounds, while the forecast cash flows in Chinese renminbi were almost fully hedged with an unhedged position of 4%.\n\nTo cover foreign currency exposure risks of the vehicle business operations forward foreign exchange contracts and currency options are primarily used. The Mercedes-Benz Group's policies call for a mixture of these financial instruments depending on the assessment of market conditions. Value at risk is used to\n\nStatements\n\nmeasure the exchange-rate risk inherent in these derivative financial instruments.\n\n## Hedge accounting\n\nThe following table shows the period-end, high, low and average value-at-risk figures of the exchange-rate risks for the 2023 and 2022 portfolios of derivative financial instruments, which were entered into primarily in connection with the vehicle business operations and the trade receivables and payables existing at the end of quarter. Average exposure has been computed on an end-of-quarter basis. The other transactions underlying the derivative financial instruments are not included in the following value-at-risk presentation, since they comprise forecast cash flows. See also table Nominal amounts of derivative financial instruments used in hedge accounting in Note 32.\n\nWhen designating derivative financial instruments, a hedge ratio of 1 is applied. In addition, the respective volume and currency of the hedge and the underlying transaction as well as maturity dates are matched. The Group ensures an economic relationship between the underlying transaction and the hedging instrument by ensuring consistency of currency, volume and maturity. Option premiums and also forward components are not designated into the hedging relationship, but the hedging costs are deferred in other comprehensive income and recognized in profit or loss at the due date of the underlying transaction or recognized as adjustment of acquisition cost of non-financial assets. The effectiveness of the hedge is assessed at the start of and during the hedging relationship. Possible sources of ineffectiveness of the hedging relationship are:\n\n- -Changes in the credit risk on the measurement of the used hedging instrument which are not reflected in the change of the hedged currency risk.\n- -Changes in the timing of the hedged transactions.",

Transaction risks arising from liquid assets or payables in foreign currencies that result from the Group's investment or refinancing on money and capital markets are generally hedged against currency risks at the time of investing or refinancing in accordance with the Mercedes-Benz Group's internal policies. The Group uses appropriate derivative financial instruments (e.g. cross-currency interest rate swaps) to hedge against currency risk.\n\nBecause currency risks from liquidity investments or liabilities in foreign currencies are generally fully offset due to the Group's investment or refinancing and the derivative financial instruments used in this regard, these financial instruments were not included in the value-at-risk calculation presented.\n\n## Effects of currency (translation risk)\n\nFor purposes of Mercedes-Benz Group's Consolidated Financial Statements, the income and expenses and the assets and liabilities of subsidiaries located outside the euro zone are converted into euros. Therefore, period-to-period changes in exchange-rates may cause translation effects that have a significant impact on, for example, revenue, segment profit/loss (EBIT) and assets and liabilities of the Group. Unlike exchange-rate transaction risk, currency translation risk does not necessarily affect future cash flows. The Group's equity position reflects changes in carrying amounts caused by exchange-rates. In general, the Mercedes-Benz Group does not hedge against currency translation risk.\n\nStatements",

However, the majority of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities results from the financial services business operated by MercedesBenz Mobility. The Mercedes-Benz Mobility companies enter into transactions with customers that primarily result in fixed-rate receivables. The Mercedes-Benz Group's general policy is to match the refinancing of interest-bearing assets in terms of maturities and interest rates wherever economically feasible. However, for a narrowly limited portion of the receivables portfolio in selected and developed markets, Mercedes-Benz Mobility does not match refinancing in terms of maturities in order to take advantage of market opportunities. This results in the Mercedes-Benz Group being exposed to interest rate risks.\n\nA committee consisting of representatives of the relevant segments and the corporate functions manages the interest rate risk by setting targets for the interest rate risk position. The Corporate Treasury department and the local Mercedes-Benz Group companies are jointly responsible for achieving these targets. As separate functions, the Treasury Controlling and the Mercedes-Benz Mobility Controlling & Reporting department monitor target achievement on a monthly basis. In order to achieve the targeted interest rate risk positions in terms of maturities and interest rate fixing periods, the Mercedes-Benz Group also uses derivative\n\nStatements\n\nfinancial instruments such as interest rate swaps. The interest rate risk position is assessed by comparing assets and liabilities for corresponding maturities, including the impact of the relevant derivative financial instruments.\n\n## Hedge accounting\n\nDerivative financial instruments are also used in conjunction with the refinancing related to the automotive segments and liquidity management. The MercedesBenz Group steers the funding activities of the automotive segments and the financial services business at Group level.\n\nThe table Value at risk for exchange risk, interest rate risk and commodity price risk shows the period-end, high, low and average value-at-risk figures of the interest rate risk for the 2023 and 2022 portfolios of interest rate sensitive primary financial instruments and derivative financial instruments of the Group, including the financial instruments of the financial services business. Liabilities from leasing contracts for which the Mercedes-Benz Group acts as a lessee are not included in the value-at-risk of the interest rate risk. Average exposure has been computed on an end-of-quarter basis.\n\nIn the course of 2023, changes in the value at risk of interest rate sensitive financial instruments were primarily determined by the development of interest rate volatilities.\n\nWhen designating derivative hedging instruments, the Mercedes-Benz Group generally applies a hedge ratio of 1. The respective volumes, interest curves, currencies and maturity dates of the underlying transaction and the hedging instrument are generally matched. In the case of combined derivative financial instruments for interest currency hedges, the cross-currency basis spread is not designated into the hedge relationship, but deferred as a hedging cost in other comprehensive income and recognized in profit or loss over the hedge term. The Group ensures an economic relationship between the underlying transaction and the hedging instrument by ensuring consistency of interest rates, maturity terms and nominal amounts. In the case of hedging for ABS transactions of private placements, the risk of the market interest rate component is partly protected, which historically covers on average more than 70% of the change in value of the total interest rate. The effectiveness of the hedge is assessed at the beginning and during the hedging relationship using the hypothetical derivative method.

The Mercedes-Benz Group concludes e.g. power purchase agreements for wind and solar energy in order to protect itself from fluctuations in energy prices and ensure long-term, sustainable procurement of electricity.\n\nStatements\n\nA small portion of the raw-material price risk relating to the forecast procurement of precious metals was hedged with the use of derivative financial instruments. The Mercedes-Benz Group has decided to suspend these hedging strategies for precious metals until further notice. The previously existing hedges expired in 2023.\n\nThe table Value at risk for exchange-rate risk, interest rate risk and commodity price risk shows the periodend, high, low and average value-at-risk figures for the 2022 portfolio of derivative financial instruments used to hedge commodity price risk. Average exposure has been computed on an end-of-quarter basis. The transactions underlying the derivative financial instruments are not included in the value-at-risk presentation.\n\n## Derivative financial instruments without hedge accounting\n\nIn 2023, the nominal volumes of hedging instruments not designated in a hedging relationship, amounted to \u20ac 9 billion (2022: \u20ac 12 billion) for derivatives used to hedge interest rate risks and \u20ac 13 billion (2022: \u20ac 15 billion) for derivatives used to hedge exchange-rate risks, as well as \u20ac 644 million (2022: \u20ac 644 million) for derivatives used to hedge commodity price risks (energy and raw materials).\n\n## Equity-price risk\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz Group predominantly holds investments in shares of companies which are classified as long-term investments, some of which are accounted for in the Consolidated Financial Statements using the equity method, such as the share in Daimler Truck Holding AG and BBAC. These investments are not included in a market risk assessment by the Group.",

Segment reporting\n\n## Reported segments\n\nThe Group comprises the segments Mercedes-Benz Cars, Mercedes-Benz Vans and Mercedes-Benz Mobility.\n\nThe breakdown of the segments corresponds to the internal organizational and reporting structure. The vehicle segments develop and manufacture premium and luxury cars as well as vans. In addition to the Mercedes-Benz brand, the brand portfolio of the Mercedes-Benz Cars segment encompasses the brands Mercedes-AMG and Mercedes-Maybach, as well as the G-Class product brand. Mercedes me provides access to the digital services of Mercedes-Benz Cars. At Mercedes-Benz Vans, the vans are sold under the Mercedes-Benz brand. Corresponding spare parts and accessories are also sold.\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz Mobility segment supports the sales of the Mercedes-Benz Group's automotive brands worldwide. The product range primarily includes customized mobility and financial services: from leasing and financing packages for end customers and dealers to insurance solutions, flexible subscription and rental models and fleet management services for business customers, with the latter primarily offered via the Athlon brand. Furthermore, Mercedes-Benz Mobility is\n\nStatements\n\nactive in the area of innovative and digital mobility services, seamless payment methods and the expansion of the charging infrastructure.\n\n## Reconciliation\n\nThe reconciliation includes functions and services provided by the Group's headquarters as well as by equity investments not allocated to the segments (e.g. Daimler Truck Holding AG). In addition, the reconciliation includes items at the corporate level and the effects on earnings of eliminating intra-Group transactions between the segments.\n\n## Internal management and reporting structure\n\nThe internal management and reporting structure at the Mercedes-Benz Group is principally based on the accounting policies according to IFRS that are described in Note 1.\n\nThe measure of the Group's net profit or loss used by the Mercedes-Benz Group's management and reporting structure is referred to as 'EBIT'. EBIT comprises gross profit, selling and general administrative expenses, research and non-capitalized development costs, other operating income/expense, and the gains/losses on equity-method investments, as well as other financial income/expense.\n\nIn justified individual cases, effects on the Group's Consolidated Statement of Income, Consolidated Statement of Financial Position, and Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows are not allocated to the corresponding segment based on a legal point of view, but the segment report rather follows an economic approach.\n\nIntersegment revenue is principally recorded at prices that approximate market terms.\n\nTransactions between the segments are generally eliminated in the reconciliation. The elimination of effects connected with intra-Group transfers of equity investments principally takes place in the segments involved. The effects on earnings at the Group are normally recognized in the corresponding segment upon completion of the external transaction. Some simplifications have been made in the segment reporting with regard to accounting for leasing agreements in connection with intra-Group transactions.\n\nSegment assets principally comprise all assets. The assets of the Mercedes-Benz Cars and Mercedes-Benz Vans segments exclude income tax assets, assets from defined benefit pension plans and other postemployment benefit plans, and certain financial instruments (including liquidity).\n\nCorporate GovernFurther Information Further Information",

The Mercedes-Benz Cars and Mercedes-Benz Vans reporting segments' liabilities exclude income tax liabilities, liabilities from pensions and similar obligations and certain financial instruments (including financing liabilities).\n\nThe residual-value risks associated with the Group's operating leases and receivables from financial services are generally borne by the segments which manufactured the leased vehicles. Risk sharing is based on agreements between Mercedes-Benz Cars, MercedesBenz Vans and Mercedes-Benz Mobility; the terms vary by segment and geographic region.\n\nNon-current assets consist of intangible assets, property, plant and equipment, and equipment on operating leases.\n\nCapital expenditures for intangible assets and property, plant and equipment reflect the cash-effective additions to these intangible assets and property, plant and equipment insofar as they do not relate to capitalized borrowing costs or goodwill.\n\nDepreciation and amortization may also include impairments insofar as they do not relate to goodwill impairment according to IAS 36.\n\nStatements\n\nAmortization of capitalized borrowing costs is not included in the amortization of intangible assets or depreciation of property, plant and equipment.\n\nCorporate GovernFurther Information Further Information",

Capital management\n\nNet assets and value added represent the basis for capital management at the Mercedes-Benz Group. Although individual companies in the Mercedes-Benz Mobility segment are subject to the capital requirements of the respective banking supervision, Mercedes-Benz Group AG is not subject to external minimum capital requirements.\n\nThe assets and liabilities of the segments in accordance with IFRS provide the basis for the determination of net assets at Group level. Mercedes-Benz Cars and Mercedes-Benz Vans are accountable for the net operating assets; all assets, liabilities and provisions for which they are responsible for in day-to-day operations are therefore allocated to them. Performance measurement at Mercedes-Benz Mobility is on an equity basis, in line with the usual practice in the banking business. Net assets at Group level additionally include assets and liabilities from income taxes as well as other corporate items and eliminations.\n\nAverage annual net assets are calculated on the basis of average quarterly net assets. The average quarterly net assets are calculated as an average of the net assets at the beginning and the end of the quarter.\n\nStatements\n\n## Average net assets\n\n|                                             | 2023   | 2022   |\n|---------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| In millions of euros                        |        |        |\n| Mercedes-Benz Cars                          | 41,407 | 38,189 |\n| Mercedes-Benz Vans                          | 1,253  | 885    |\n| Mercedes-Benz Mobility 1                    | 13,774 | 14,466 |\n| Net assets of the segments                  | 56,434 | 53,540 |\n| Equity-method investment  in DTHAG          | 8,221  | 8,078  |\n| Other equity-method  investments 2          | 253    | 303    |\n| Assets and liabilities  from income taxes 3 | -5,159 | -3,818 |\n| Other corporate items  and eliminations 3   | 94     | 422    |\n| Net assets of the Mercedes-Benz Group       | 59,843 | 58,525 |\n\n- 1 Equity.\n- 2   Unless allocated to the segments.\n- 3  To the extent not allocated to Mercedes-Benz Mobility.\n\nThe cost of capital of the Group's average net assets is reflected in value added. Value added shows the extent to which the Group achieves or exceeds the minimum return requirements of the shareholders, thus creating additional value. The required rate of return on net assets, and thus the cost of capital rate, is derived from the minimum rates of return that equity investors and lenders expect on their invested capital. In the reporting year, the cost of capital rate used for the internal capital management amounted to 9% after taxes.\n\nThe objective of capital management is to increase value added, among other things, by optimizing the cost of capital. This is achieved on the one hand by optimizing the net assets, e.g. working capital, which is within the operational responsibility of the segments. In addition, taking into account legal regulations, the Mercedes-Benz Group strives to optimize the costs and risks of its capital structure, and consequently, the cost of capital rate. An example of this is an appropriate level of liquidity, oriented towards the operational requirements.",

Earnings per share\n\nThe calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share is based on net profit attributable to shareholders of Mercedes-Benz Group AG. The profit attributable to shareholders of Mercedes-Benz Group AG (basic and diluted) amounts to \u20ac 14,261 million (2022: \u20ac 14,501 million). The weighted average number of shares outstanding (basic and diluted) amounts to 1,059.6 million issued shares (2022: 1,069.8 million issued shares).

(BBAC), which are allocated to the Mercedes-Benz Cars segment.\n\nThere are numerous relationships in the scope of ordinary business between the Mercedes-Benz Group and Daimler Truck , for example, the purchase and sale of goods and services and leasing agreements. In addition, there is an interim provision of services by corporate functions that are included under other operating income.\n\nThe leased equipment of the Mercedes-Benz Mobility segment includes commercial vehicles produced by Daimler Truck which have been acquired from external dealers or other third parties not related to the Mercedes-Benz Group. Mercedes-Benz Mobility usually receives a residual-value guarantee from Daimler Truck for this leased equipment in connection with the obligation to return the respective commercial vehicles to Daimler Truck. At 31 December 2023 this guarantee was \u20ac 37 million (31 December 2022: \u20ac 66 million).\n\nAdditionally, the Mercedes-Benz Group will continue the leasing and sales-financing business for Daimler Truck's commercial vehicles in some markets. To this end, Mercedes-Benz Mobility acquires these vehicles\n\nStatements\n\nfrom Daimler Truck and leases them to the end customers. Insofar as a mandatory vehicle return to Daimler Truck has been agreed, a leasing contract (head lease) between Mercedes-Benz Mobility and Daimler Truck is shown. The contract between Mercedes-Benz Mobility and the end customer constitutes a sublease in this respect. The receivables and right-of-use assets shown in the table include demands for the repurchase of vehicles of \u20ac 1,121 million (31 December 2022: \u20ac 1,312 million) shown in receivables from financial services and right-of-use assets of \u20ac 268 million (31 December 2022: \u20ac 548 million) vis-\u00e0-vis Daimler Truck shown in equipment on operating leases. These rightof-use assets were depreciated as planned by \u20ac 217 million in 2023 (2022: \u20ac 399 million).\n\nIn addition, the Mercedes-Benz Group holds a minority interest of \u20ac 207 million (31 December 2022: \u20ac 162 million) in real estate companies controlled by Daimler Truck Group, which is shown as debt instruments in other financial assets.\n\nAt 31 December 2023, off-balance-sheet obligations to the Daimler Truck Group amounted to \u20ac 110 million (31 December 2022: \u20ac 310 million).\n\n## Joint ventures\n\nOn 12 May 2022, Mercedes-Benz AG signed an agreement with PSA Automobiles SA, Opel Automobile GmbH, Saft EV SAS and Saft Groupe to acquire a 33.33% stake in Automotive Cells Company SE (ACC) through a capital contribution of approximately \u20ac 390 million. The Group also committed itself to the provision of further funds up to \u20ac 410 million. The investment in the European battery cell manufacturer ACC was made in order to promote the development and production of high-performance battery cells and modules in the course of the transformation to a sustainable business strategy. The shares in the joint venture ACC are included in the Consolidated Financial Statements using the equity method and are allocated to the Mercedes-Benz Cars segment.\n\nIn the third quarter of 2023, an additional contract with PSA Automobiles SA, Opel Automobile GmbH, Saft EV SAS, Saft Groupe and Automotive Cells Company SE (ACC) was signed in which the Group committed to providing further funds of up to \u20ac 457 million to ACC in addition to the commitments agreed in 2022.

Moreover, in March 2024, ACC drew down \u20ac 105 million of the total contractually committed funds of \u20ac 867 million. As a result, the carrying amount of ACC increased accordingly.\n\nAs of 31 December 2023, there are off-balance-sheet obligations of \u20ac 256 million (31 December 2022: \u20ac 157 million).\n\nOn 1 July 2022, an agreement became effective in favour of smart Automobile Co., Ltd. (smart), a joint venture of Mercedes-Benz AG and Zhejiang Geely Holding Group Co., Ltd. This agreement obliges the shareholders to provide financial support up to a maximum amount of \u20ac 573 million each in the event that smart is not able to perform its payment obligations under a syndicated loan agreement. smart is allocated to the Mercedes-Benz Cars segment.\n\nNote 13 provides further details of the business activities of the significant associated companies.\n\nStatements\n\n## Related persons\n\n## Contributions to plan assets\n\nThroughout the world, the Group has business relationships with numerous entities that are customers and/or suppliers of the Group. Those customers and/or suppliers include companies that have a connection with some of the members of the Board of Management or of the Supervisory Board and close family members of those board members of Mercedes-Benz Group AG or of its subsidiaries. Board of Management and Supervisory Board members and close family members of those board members may also purchase goods and services from Mercedes-Benz Group AG or its subsidiaries as customers.\n\nMr. Stefan Pierer has been a member of the Supervisory Board of Mercedes-Benz Group AG and MercedesBenz AG since May 2023. The Mercedes-Benz Group maintains supply and service relationships with some companies in the Pierer Group.

As legal entities involved in the hive-down, Mercedes-Benz Group AG, Mercedes-Benz AG and Daimler Truck AG are jointly and severally liable pursuant to Section 133 Subsections 1 and 3 of the German Transformation Act (UmwG) for the liabilities of Mercedes-Benz Group AG incurred prior to the effective date of the hive-down. Those of the aforementioned legal entities to which the relevant liabilities are not assigned under the hive-down agreement are, however, only liable for those liabilities if they fall due within five years of the announcement of the entry of the hivedown in the commercial register of Mercedes-Benz Group AG and claims therefrom are established in court or in another manner as described in Section 133 of the German Transformation Act (UmwG). The spin off and hive-down of the Daimler commercial vehicle business in 2021 resulted in a subsequent liability relationship outside the Group.\n\nThe stipulations existing in this context, in particular on the procedure for regulating the internal settlements between the participating legal entities, are laid down in the hive-down agreement of 25 March 2019.\n\nStatements\n\nThe aforementioned period is ten years for pension obligations based on the German Company Pensions Act (BetrAVG) that existed before the hive-down took effect. Mercedes-Benz Group AG and Mercedes-Benz AG do not expect any outflow of liquidity from the respective other legal entity due to the plan assets being available in a sufficient volume.\n\nAccording to the current appraisal, an actual claim with respect to the subsequent liability relationship between the entities is considered to be unlikely.\n\nCorporate GovernFurther Information Further Information",

We performed the audit of the consolidated financial statements in supplementary compliance with the International Standards on Auditing (ISAs). Our responsibilities under those requirements, principles and standards are further described in the 'Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements and of the Combined Management Report' section of our auditor's report. We are independent of the group entities in accordance with the requirements of European law and German commercial and professional law, and we have fulfilled our other German professional responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. In addition, in accordance with Article 10 paragraph 2 letter f) of the EU Audit Regulation, we declare that we have not provided non-audit services prohibited under Article 5 paragraph 1 of the EU Audit Regulation. We believe that the evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the combined management report.\n\n## Note on the emphasis of a particular matter\n\nWe refer to the comments of the legal representatives in the section on 'EU taxonomy' in the section entitled 'non-financial statement' that is included in the combined management report in accordance with Sections 289b paragraph 1, 289c, 315b paragraph 1 and 315c HGB. There it is stated that the EU taxonomy Regulation and the delegated acts promulgated for this includes wording and terms that are subject to considerable uncertainty with regard to their interpretation and for which clarifications have not yet been published in all cases. The legal representatives describe how they have carried out the necessary interpretation of the EU taxonomy Regulation and the delegated acts promulgated for this. On account of the immanent risk that certain abstract legal terms can be interpreted in various ways, the conformity of the interpretation with the law is subject to uncertainty. Our opinions on the on the consolidated financial statements and on the combined management report has not been modified in this regard.\n\n## Key audit matters in the audit of the consolidated financial statements\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements for the financial year from January 1 to December 31, 2023. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and, in forming our opinion thereon, we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n## Impairment Risk on Operating Leases\n\nPlease refer with regard to the accounting policies and methods applied to the notes to the consolidated financial statements in Note 1 'Significant accounting policies' and Note 2 'Accounting estimates and management judgements'. Further information on the operating leases can be found in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in Note 12 'Equipment on operating leases' and in the comments in the combined management report in the section entitled 'Industry and business risks and opportunities'.\n\n## The risk for the consolidated financial statements\n\nThe statement of financial position caption 'Equipment on operating leases' (\u20ac 41,712 million) includes among other things Mercedes-Benz passenger cars, which are purchased by non-group dealers or other third parties and are the subject of an operating lease with the Mercedes-Benz Group. An impairment risk exists with regard to these vehicles that is primarily dependent on the residual value achievable at the end of the lease. These future residual values are dependent on the situation in the used vehicle markets prevailing when the vehicles are returned. The future-oriented valuation is based on a number of discretionary assumptions. The risk for the financial statements is that any impairment losses will not be recognised or that the amounts recognised will be inadequate.",

        "page_content": "## Our audit approach\n\nWe audited the recoverability of these externally purchased Mercedes-Benz passenger cars in the statement of financial position caption 'Equipment on operating leases'. We investigated and appraised the indications assumed by the Group for any need for an impairment loss and where necessary obtained an understanding of the write-downs calculated by the Mercedes-Benz Group. We have assessed the Mercedes-Benz Group's evaluation with regard to the residual values achievable by the end of the terms of the leases. In this connection, we in particular critically reviewed the main influencing factors, such as the expected number of returns from leasing, the current marketing results in order to assess the accuracy of the estimates and future vehicle model changes. For the significant US-market we furthermore also audited the consistency of the assumptions made by the Mercedes-Benz Group with residual value forecasts by independent expert third parties.\n\n## Our observations\n\nThe assumptions and assessments providing the basis for the assessment of the recoverability of the externally purchased Mercedes-Benz passenger cars in the statement of financial position caption 'Equipment on operating leases' and the recorded impairment losses are appropriate.\n\n## Valuation Allowances on Receivables from Financial Services\n\nPlease refer with regard to the accounting policies applied to the notes to the consolidated financial statements in Note 2 'Accounting estimates and management judgements'. Further information on allowances on receivables from financial services can be found in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in Note 1 'Significant Accounting Policies', in Note 14 'Receivables from financial services', in Note 33 'Management of financial risks' and in the combined management report in the section entitled 'Financial risks and opportunities'.\n\n## The risk for the consolidated financial statements\n\nReceivables from financial services (\u20ac 88,211 million) resulting from the Group's financing and leasing activities include receivables from sales financing with customers, receivables from sales financing with dealers and receivables from finance lease contracts. The loss allowances on these receivables amounted at the reporting date to \u20ac 1,055 million.\n\nThe calculation of the loss allowances is based on expected credit losses and therefore also includes expectations regarding the future. Recognition of the expected credit losses is carried out by means of a three-parameter procedure for the determination of loss allowances. At the same time, various factors determining the value, such as the determination of statistical default probabilities and loss rates, the\n\npossible amount receivable on default, the parameter transfer criteria that are related to a significant change in the default risk of borrowers, and the calculation of future cash flows. Furthermore, macroeconomic scenarios (basis scenarios, optimistic and pessimistic scenarios) flow into the calculation, the identification of which to a high degree includes discretionary judgements and uncertainties. The risk for the financial statements is that the creditworthiness of customers and future cash flows is misjudged or that the calculation of the risk provision parameters is incorrect so that loss allowances are not recognised or are insufficient.\n\n## Our audit approach\n\nWe obtained a comprehensive understanding of the development of the portfolios, the associated counterparty default risks and the processes for identifying, managing, monitoring and measuring credit risks by inspecting analyses and risk reports, interrogations, review of guidelines and working instructions, checking the defined methods and their implementation and checking and walking through the validation process and the individual validation reports.\n\nWe audited the appropriateness and effectiveness of the internal control system in relation to the risk models as well as the determination of the value-determining factors and the valuation allowances, also in part through recalculation. We also assessed the relevant IT systems and internal processes. In addition to the correctness of the relevant IT systems and associated interfaces to ensure the completeness and accuracy of the data using our IT special lists, the audit also",

Our audit focused on assessing the methodology used to determine and to calculate the probabilities of default and loss given default, which are derived from historical data. We took into account the current economic uncertainties in connection with the effects of several geopolitical hotspots when testing the macroeconomic scenarios and the model assumptions made. Based on the results of a validation performed by Mercedes-Benz Mobility, we satisfied ourselves of the appropriateness of key risk provisioning parameters and assessed the parameter adjustments made to reflect current market conditions. In this context, we examined the data underlying the validations.\n\n## Our observations\n\nThe methodical approach, the procedures and the processes to calculate the loss allowances and the assumptions and risk parameters flowing into the measurement are appropriate to identify the credit risks in good time and to determine the recognition of adequate loss allowances.\n\n## Measurement of the Provision for Product Warranties\n\nPlease refer with regard to the accounting policies and methods applied to the notes to the consolidated financial statements in Note 1 'Significant accounting policies' and in Note 2 'Accounting estimates and management judgements'. Further information on the guarantees and product warranties can be found in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in Note 23 'Provisions for other risks' and in the comments in the combined management report in the section entitled 'Company-specific risks and opportunities - Warranty and goodwill cases'.\n\n## The risk for the consolidated financial statements\n\nThe provision for product warranties amounts to \u20ac 6,399 million and is included in the provisions for other risks.\n\nMercedes-Benz Group is exposed to claims arising from various types of product warranty claims or grants various types of product guarantees under which it vouches for the defect-free functioning of a MercedesBenz Group product sold or a service provided for a certain period of time. In order to confirm or reassess future warranty, guarantee and goodwill expenses, continuously updated information on the type and volume of damage that has occurred and its rectification is recorded and analysed at the level of division, model series, damage code and sales year.\n\nIndependent Auditor's Report\n\nSignificant uncertainty for the calculation of the provision arises with regard to the future loss event. The risk for the consolidated financial statements is that the provision is not properly measured.\n\n## Our audit approach\n\nOur audit procedures included among other things the evaluation of the process to calculate the provision for product warranties and the evaluation of the relevant assumptions and their derivation for the measurement of the provision. These include primarily assumptions on expected susceptibility to and the course of damage, and in addition the monetary value of the damage per vehicle based on actual warranty, guarantee and goodwill losses. Based on historical analyses, we assessed the accuracy of the forecasts of past warranty, guarantee and goodwill costs. We also checked that updated assessments of the future repair costs and procedures were taken into account. We obtained an understanding for the underlying numbers of vehicles through the actual unit sales.\n\n## Our observations\n\nThe calculation methods and the assumptions made are appropriate.",

Further information on legal proceedings can be found in Note 23 'Provisions for other risks', in Note 30 'Legal proceedings' in the notes to the consolidated financial statements and in the combined management report in the section 'Legal and tax risks and opportunities - Legal risks'.\n\n## The risk for the consolidated financial statements\n\nMercedes-Benz Group AG and its subsidiaries face various legal proceedings, claims and governmental investigations and administrative orders (legal proceedings) on a wide range of topics, including for example vehicle safety, emissions, fuel economy, financial services, dealer, supplier and other contractual relationships, intellectual property rights, product warranties, environmental matters, antitrust matters (including actions for damages) and shareholder matters. Product-related proceedings involve, among other things, claims asserted in part by way of a class action due to possible vehicle defects. If the outcome of such legal proceedings is detrimental to the Mercedes-Benz Group, the Group may be required to pay substantial compensatory and punitive damages or fines. In addition, service actions, recall campaigns or other costly actions may have to be undertaken.\n\nWhether the recognition of a provision and, if so, in what amount it is necessary on account of legal proceedings is dependent to a high degree on discretionary estimates and assumptions by the legal representatives. In view of this and the monetary amounts involved with regard to the risks, the following legal proceedings of the Mercedes-Benz Group are in our opinion of particular importance.\n\na)  Diesel emission behaviour: class action and other lawsuits in Germany, United Kingdom and other countries in the Mercedes-Benz Cars and Mercedes-Benz Vans segments\n\nConsumer lawsuits, some of which have been consolidated into a class action, and other lawsuits in various jurisdictions, including the United Kingdom, allege that Mercedes-Benz Group AG and/or individual subsidiaries have used devices that improperly reduce the effectiveness of emission control systems to reduce nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions and cause excessive emissions from diesel vehicles. In addition, the plaintiffs allege that consumers were deceived in connection with advertising claims for Mercedes-Benz diesel vehicles.\n\nIn Germany, a large number of customers of diesel vehicles are suing for damages or cancellation of purchase contracts. They claim that the diesel vehicles were equipped with unauthorised defeat devices and/ or had unacceptably high emission or consumption values.\n\nIn addition, investors have filed claims for damages in Germany due to the alleged violation of capital market disclosure regulations and have also claimed damages out of court. The investors allege that the Mercedes-Benz Group did not immediately publish insider information in connection with the emissions behaviour of its Mercedes-Benz diesel vehicles and also made false and misleading public statements. They also claim that the purchase price of the financial instruments they acquired (in particular Mercedes-Benz Group shares; formerly Daimler shares) would have been lower if the Mercedes-Benz Group had reported as required.\n\nb)  Diesel emissions behaviour: Regulatory proceedings in the Mercedes-Benz Cars a nd Mercedes-Benz Vans segments\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz Group is subject to ongoing governmental inquiries, investigations, examinations, orders and proceedings relating to various laws and regulations in connection with diesel exhaust emissions. The activities of various authorities worldwide relate in particular to test results and emission control systems in Mercedes-Benz diesel vehicles and/or the Mercedes-Benz Group's interactions with the relevant authorities as well as related legal issues and implications, for example under applicable environmental, criminal, consumer protection and antitrust laws.",

        "page_content": "The Mercedes-Benz Group has recognized provisions for legal proceedings as at December 31, 2023. The prerequisite for the recognition of provisions for legal proceedings is that a current external obligation exists that is likely to lead to an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits and can be reliably estimated. The amount of the provisions is determined on the basis of the best possible estimate of the obligation by the legal representatives as at the balance sheet date. The recognition and measurement of the recognized provisions for the legal proceedings are based on discretionary estimates and assumptions by the legal representatives.\n\nThere is a risk for the financial statements that the provisions for the legal proceedings are not recognized or not recognized to a sufficient extent.\n\n## Our audit approach\n\nOur audit procedures included, on the one hand, an assessment of the process established by the company to ensure the identification of risks, the assessment of the outcome of the proceedings and the presentation of the legal proceedings in the financial statements. Secondly, we held discussions with the internal legal department and other departments familiar with the matters, external advisors and lawyers of the company in order to obtain an explanation of the developments and the reasons that led to the corresponding assessments. In addition, we assessed the underlying documents and minutes as well as the calculations for the respective provisions. We were provided with the legal representatives' assessment of the developments in the aforementioned areas in written form by the company. We also interviewed the legal representatives of the company. As at the balance sheet date, assessments by external lawyers were available on the material proceedings, which support the risk assessment made by the legal representatives.\n\nWhere agreement has since been reached on individual matters, we compared the amounts originally estimated with the final obligations to obtain an understanding of the quality of the estimates.\n\nFinally, we assessed the appropriateness of the disclosures on the aforementioned legal proceedings in the notes to the consolidated financial statements and in the combined management report.\n\nIndependent Auditor's Report\n\n## Our observations\n\nThe judgement-based estimates and assumptions of the legal representatives are appropriate.\n\n## Other information\n\nThe legal representatives and the Supervisory Board are responsible for the other information.
