        "page_content": "## Who We Are\n\nIncitec Pivot Limited (IPL) is a leading manufacturer and supplier to the resources and agricultural sectors. With iconic brands, leading technology solutions and great customers, we operate in the resilient markets of agriculture, mining and quarry and construction. With a team of just over 5,800 dedicated employees, we have a strong safety culture that we're committed to building on. 'Zero Harm for Everyone, Everywhere' is our core IPL value and what we strive for daily. And we are committed to a sustainable and decarbonised world.\n\nAn ASX100 company, IPL has two industry leading businesses, Dyno Nobel based in the Americas, Asia Paci/fic and Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) regions and Incitec Pivot Fertilisers (IPF) , a leading integrated manufacturer and distributor of fertilisers across the east coast of Australia. We are an international business with world-scale explosives and fertiliser manufacturing, leading technology solutions, marketing and servicing operations. We are proud to be considered a trusted partner by customers and suppliers.\n\nServing high quality customers with technological solutions across six continents - Australia, North America, Europe, Asia, South America and Africa - we manufacture ammonium nitratebased explosives and initiating systems, nitrogen and phosphorus fertilisers, and nitrogen related industrial and specialty chemicals.\n\nWe have embraced the challenge of reducing our greenhouse gas emissions while continuing to provide products which help increase yields of food and /fibre and access the minerals and aggregates required for new technologies and infrastructure rebuilding. Our ambition is to reach Net Zero operational emissions by 2050, or sooner if practicable. Our Net Zero Pathway shows the enablers and technologies required to reduce our own emissions, along with the expected timeframe for each. Our scope 3 Pathway shows the management strategies and key enablers identi/fied to date to reduce the GHG from each value chain category.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur climate change management strategy is focused on four key pillars: Ensuring strong governance; Reducing operational emissions; Delivering products and strategies that reduce scope 3 emissions; and Managing strategic business risks and opportunities.\n\nIPL's focus is building our businesses so they thrive and prosper in the long term, at the same time caring for our people, communities, customers and environment.\n\n## Dyno Nobel\n\nDyno Nobel is IPL's international explosives and technical blasting services business and one of the largest industrial explosives distributors in North America and Australia. Blasting is an essential step in extracting the minerals required to meet the world's demand for energy, infrastructure and consumer goods. Construction, mines, quarries and seismic explorers use Dyno Nobel products to achieve safety goals and improve operational e/fficiency.\n\nWith major manufacturing sites across Australia and the US, including key sites in Cheyenne (Wyoming, US), Louisiana (Missouri, US), Waggaman (Louisiana, US) and Moranbah (Queensland, Australia), we provide a full range of reliable explosives products from plants around the world and extensive blasting services. In fact, we boast some of the most highly trained blasters and technical experts in the industry, and operate in Australia, Canada, the United States, Indonesia, Mexico, Chile, Papua New Guinea, Turkey and France.\n\nWith a rich technology heritage, IPL's key technology drivers are to improve safety, productivity & e/fficiency, and sustainability. As mining becomes more complex and regulated, customer needs are re/fining and changing. With a long history of technical innovation, and excellence in collaborative partnerships, Dyno Nobel understands what our customer's needs are today and the solutions they need for their mining operations of tomorrow.\n\nThe energy transition and need for decarbonisation, are driving the signi/ficant demand for battery minerals and metals. In addition, miners are having to go deeper and target lower grade orebodies, which increases cost and makes safe access more di/fficult. New and innovative mining methods are required to extract these valuable products. Future technologies utilising automation that enables remote loading and /firing, will play an increasing role in mineral extraction. It will also remove people from hazardous situations.\n\nOur research & development focuses on practical ways to use new technologies to bene/fit our customers. During 2023 we built an electric Mobile Processing Unit (MPU) complete with solar charging station. Our o/ffer includes DIFFERENTIAL ENERGY\u00ae, DigiShot\u00ae (1) Plus.4G, Advanced Vibration Prediction Model, Fracture Density Model and our advanced electronic detonators.",

        "page_content": "## Growth in /first ever tagging and hole identi/fication using DGPS\n\nDyno Nobel commercialised the /first ever tagging and hole identi/fication using Di/fferential Global Positioning System (DGPS) technology in 2021. In the last 12 months, its use at key Australian sites has grown signi/ficantly. Paired with DigiShot\u00ae Plus.4G, DGPS technology allows individual blastholes to be identi/fied via the system's high location accuracy of less than one metre. This revolutionises the deployment and tagging of detonators, with the potential to positively impact overall mining outcomes.\n\nCustomers directly bene/fit through proven improvements in productivity during the blasting process. A recent time and motion study at a customer site conducted by IPL has shown a 40 per cent reduction in the tagging process when using DGPS compared to conventional systems. The /flexible tagging path also enables shot/firers to start at any hole and tag in any sequence.\n\nAutomatic hole identi/fication helps eliminate out of sequence /firing (due to incorrect hole identi/fication and marking), which has the potential to improve safety outcomes. This technology is capable of integration into fully autonomous deployment and tagging, which is set to revolutionise the industry.\n\n## Incitec Pivot Fertilisers\n\nIPF is the leading fertiliser manufacturer and distributor on the east coast of Australia. Our people, products and services support farming communities and contribute to maximising growers' yields, which in turn helps feed millions around the globe. Resilient, diverse and proud, we are driven by science, innovation and maximising soil potential.\n\nThe business has integrated operating assets including Australia's largest fertiliser manufacturing infrastructure - Phosphate Hill and our Geelong plant. Our fertiliser products are distributed via IPF's network of 17 strategically placed primary distribution centres with the majority (11) at key deep-water ports.\n\nAs part of our commitment to a sustainable future, our Gibson Island facility has the potential to become the world's /first existing ammonia plant to be retro/fitted to use renewable hydrogen. We continue to work with our partners at Fortescue Future Industries on the exciting potential transformation of the Gibson Island manufacturing plant to a green ammonia facility. A /final investment decision is planned before the end of this calendar year.\n\nThrough our comprehensive 'Agronomy in Practice' training course we help educate and develop the capability of Australian agronomists. Using an interactive and engaging program with hands-on activities and assessments at every step of the way, it's the ultimate course in soil, plant tissue and water sampling. It delivers practical interpretation analysis enabling great stewardship and productivity increases from our fertiliser plus soil health recommendations.\n\nOur Enhanced E/fficiency Fertiliser range helps growers maintain yields while reducing the GHG emissions associated with nitrogen fertilisation. When it comes to liquid fertilisers, easier storage, more sustainable, precise applications and expanded application windows make them an increasingly popular choice, and we're pleased to be bringing these products to growers, who are looking to capitalise on the signi/ficant productivity and sustainability bene/fits delivered.\n\nIPF's leading brands include Granulock\u00ae, SuPerfect\u00ae and our patented nitri/fication inhibitor eNpower\u00ae. With a dedicated network of suppliers and agents across the east coast of Australia, as well as our NATA-accredited Nutrient\n\nAdvantage\u00ae Laboratory, Incitec Pivot Fertilisers supports farmers with the crop nutrition insights and products they need to maximise yield potential in an e/fficient way. Further a/field, through our global trading business Southern Cross Fertilisers, we sell and trade in major o/ffshore agricultural markets including Asia Paci/fic, the Indian subcontinent, the United States, Latin America and other international locations.\n\n## Smart fertilisers\n\nIncitec Pivot Fertilisers is the lead industry partner in the Australian Research Council funded Hub for Smart Fertilisers (the Hub). The multidisciplinary Hub is applying plant and soil science, chemistry and chemical engineering to develop new biochemical nitrogen inhibitors and the next generation of 'smart fertilisers' to increase the e/fficiency of nitrogen use by up to 20 per cent, meaning farmers can apply less fertiliser.\n\nBased at the University of Melbourne, the work of the Hub is aimed at saving farmers money whilst reducing impacts on the environment, including reducing losses to the air as GHG and to waterways through leaching, resulting in better tools for agriculture businesses to manage their fertiliser use.\n\nFood and agribusiness are critical to Australia's economy and is on track to contribute $92 billion to the national economy in 2022-23 and aims to achieve a $100 billion farm gate output by 2030. The agricultural industry directly employs around 239,000 people and is a major source of jobs in rural and regional Australia. (2)\n\nThe Hub is a partnership between the University of Melbourne, La Trobe University, Incitec Pivot Fertilisers and Elders Rural Services Australia, and involves representatives from key agricultural businesses and development corporations.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Chairman's Report\n\nAcross the IPL Group during 2023 we have renewed our focus on safety and delivering improved and more predictable operating business results.\n\nWe have progressed key strategic projects, delivered a better second half FY23 underlying earnings result and, subject to completion of the Waggaman sale, have announced our intent to reward shareholders with signi/ficant capital returns.\n\nOur achievements were made possible by our talented and highly skilled people, of whom we are very proud. We thank them for their sustained e/fforts and ability to deliver valuable outcomes for our customers, shareholders and other stakeholders.\n\n## Financial performance\n\nWe reported Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) of $880m, excluding individually material items (IMIs). This was our second highest EBIT since 2008 and comes after a record result last year. Net Pro/fit After Tax (NPAT), excluding IMIs, was $582m and our $701m operating cash /flow remains strong o/ff last year's record result.\n\nThe Board was pleased to announce a /final dividend of 5 cents per share, taking our total dividend for the /financial year to 15 cents per share.\n\nWe retain a strong balance sheet whilst planning to deliver up to $1.4 billion of capital returns to shareholders, subject to completion of the Waggaman sale. This represents returning approximately 25% of capital to our shareholders.\n\nIn FY24 the Board will continue to focus on delivering strong /financial results and returns to shareholders while maintaining our balance sheet strength.\n\n## Reshaping the portfolio\n\nWe continue to work on reshaping our business portfolio to best position our company for sustainable, long-term /financial returns. We remain committed to separating our two operating businesses, inevitably exiting our fertiliser business and refocusing our e/fforts on the Dyno Nobel explosives business.\n\nEngagement on a potential sale for our fertilisers business continues.\n\nIn March, we were pleased to announce the sale of the Waggaman ammonia manufacturing facility to CF Industries, alongside a 25-year cost competitive ammonia supply agreement. Subject to the sale receiving regulatory approvals, we expect the transaction to close on 1 December 2023. It is intended that the funds received will be returned to shareholders, whilst maintaining a suitably conservative balance sheet.\n\n## Sustainability\n\nWith more resources and investment in innovation, we have continued to prioritise the urgent challenge of climate change.\n\nOur Net Zero Strategy was overwhelmingly supported by almost 90% of shareholders who voted at our 2022 AGM in February, and we continue to engage on climate change with our investors, shareholders and other stakeholders.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAs we work towards our ambition to be Net Zero by 2050, or sooner if practical, we are progressing a number of decarbonisation projects across each of our businesses. Backed by a A$100-$120m sustainability capital investment to 2030, together they provide a potential 42% reduction in operational GHG emissions by 2030.\n\n## Leadership\n\nWe have had key leadership changes during the year, including the departure of the MD&CEO, Jeanne Johns. We acknowledge and thank Jeanne for all her e/fforts and commitment to our company during her /five and half years in the role. The Board appointed Paul Victor Interim CEO while a comprehensive search process for a permanent CEO takes place.\n\nEarlier this month, our Board Chairman Brian Kruger stepped down due to personal reasons. Brian commenced as Chairman in mid-2019 and has led our Company through the challenging COVID-19 pandemic, steered our strategy to separate our two industry leading businesses, and delivered a record pro/fit cycle, as well as our decarbonisation roadmap. Together with the Board, I would like to acknowledge Brian's e/ffective leadership and his outstanding commitment and contribution to our Company. On Brian's departure, the Board appointed me as his successor, from my position as non-executive director. I'm grateful for the trust the Board has placed in me with this appointment.\n\nIn other changes at Board level this year, the appointments of Michael Carroll and John Ho as non-executive directors were announced in March. At this year's AGM George Biltz will be stepping down from the Board, having been a very valuable Board member over the past three years. We wish him the very best for the future.\n\nIn conclusion, I look forward to continuing working alongside our Board and Management team to deliver the Company's strategy into FY24 and beyond. Your Company has committed and capable people and we are well-positioned to deliver a sustainable, long-term, and competitive business performance.\n\nGreg Robinson\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nChairman",

        "page_content": "## CEO's Report\n\nThroughout FY23, our two industry leading businesses have made signi/ficant progress and we enter FY24 with good momentum.\n\nStrong underlying earnings growth in the second half of FY23 was underpinned by our continued focus on delivering industry leading technology and services for our customers.\n\n## Safety\n\nSafety will always be our number one priority and our Zero Harm value guides our people across everything we do.  During FY23, we recorded a number of improvements, including a reduction in recordable injury severity, the most serious incidents possible.\n\nHowever, our rate of recordable injuries has not signi/ficantly improved on our FY22 results and is above our 0.70 target for FY23.\n\nWe owe it to our people, customers, shareholders and other stakeholders to deliver a much-improved safety culture and to help us get there, in November we initiated a company wide safety breakthrough campaign. All our people are safety leaders, and we will continue to support each other to take greater ownership and accountability for the safety and wellbeing of each other.\n\nTo support this safety breakthrough, myself, our Executive Team and all of us within the IPL Group are committed to a 20% yearly improvement for FY24.\n\n## Business performance\n\nAcross our businesses we have focused on safety, maintained customer pricing discipline, and improved margins.\n\nDuring FY23 our Dyno Nobel business exceeded expectations and delivered solid results.\n\nDyno Nobel Americas reported EBIT of US$390m, with customer growth in quarry & construction, metals and our operations in Chile. In North America, our product o/ffering continued to yield the best returns when compared to our competitors, with a strong dollar per tonne margin. The business completed customer repricing and a cost out initiative and the full bene/fits of these two initiatives are expected to /flow in the /first half of FY24.\n\nDyno Nobel Asia Paci/fic reported EBIT of $188m, with the execution of several key customer contracts and a strong year for the international business. The business is also bene/fiting from record AN production at Moranbah.\n\nIncitec Pivot Fertilisers reported EBIT of $153m. IPF's strong brands and unrivalled distribution network helped increase domestic fertiliser sales by 9% however, overall earnings were impacted by a challenging market and disappointing manufacturing performance. In response, we have deployed a Reliability Taskforce at Phosphate Hill to address and implement key actions.\n\n## Strategic progress\n\nWe have made good progress on a number of strategic projects and initiatives central to the current and future success of our two industry leading businesses.\n\nIn May, our Dyno Nobel Asia Paci/fic business announced a gas supply agreement for its ammonia nitrate plant in Moranbah,\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nlocking in the plant's competitive advantage for the next decade.\n\nThe /first sod was turned on Perdaman Chemical and Fertilisers' $6.5 billion urea plant in Western Australia which will provide long term urea supply for Incitec Pivot Fertiliser customers, with expected commencement of supply from mid-2027. It will be the largest downstream industrial investment in Australia's history and IPF has an exclusive 20 year o/fftake agreement for up to 2.3 million tonnes of urea per year.\n\nImproving our manufacturing reliability continues to be a key strategic focus for our senior management, with a mixed manufacturing performance during FY23. Our teams worked hard to achieve record AN production at Moranbah, record performance at Waggaman and a successful, safe, major turnaround at our Cheyenne plant in the USA and we will take these learnings and apply to our other plants.\n\nWe are focused on delivering safe, reliable and cost competitive operations across all our plants and have implemented a manufacturing reliability plan. This will include a holistic external review of our major manufacturing assets, including Phosphate Hill which will also bene/fit from an internal taskforce providing additional resources and expertise to drive required reliability improvements.\n\n## Our people\n\nSince I stepped into the role of Interim CEO in June, a highlight has been getting out to more sites and meeting as many people as possible across the business. I've been able to see in action our highly skilled, hard working people delivering for our customers and stakeholders day in, day out. This has been the driver of our success in FY23, and I want to thank all our people across the business for their exceptional work throughout the year.\n\nWe owe it to our people to create a culture where they can perform at their very best, and during FY23 we made changes to the way we work. This followed a review of our people strategy, which puts people at the centre of everything we do.\n\nOur aspiration is to create a safe, inclusive, high-performance culture. Our leaders have been empowered to build trust and transparency within their teams and create environments where deliverables are focused, realistic, and promises are kept.  This approach will continue into 2024.\n\n## Looking ahead\n\nOur company is in a strong position as we enter FY24. Our two industry leading businesses are operating in attractive markets with signi/ficant opportunities ahead for growth. As we progress our strategic initiatives with more determination than ever before, we will continue to create value for our shareholders and other stakeholders over the coming 12 months.\n\nPaul Victor\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nInterim CEO",

        "page_content": "## Operating and Financial Review\n\n## Group Overview\n\nIPL is a leading supplier in the resources and agricultural sectors with an unrelenting focus on Zero Harm. With a team of 5,800 plus dedicated employees, the Company adds value to its customers through leading technology solutions, innovation, world class services focused on the needs of its customers and manufacturing reliability. Sustainability is interlinked with IPL's strategy which is aimed at delivering sustainable growth and shareholder returns, while proactively managing those issues most material to the long-term sustainability of our business, the broader environment, and the communities in which we operate. IPL has an ambition of achieving Net Zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, or sooner if practical.\n\nIPL operates through three business units, details of which are set out in this review:\n\n- \u00bb Dyno Nobel Americas;\n- \u00bb Dyno Nobel Asia Paci/fic; and\n- \u00bb Fertilisers Asia Paci/fic.\n\nThrough Dyno Nobel, the Company plays a critical role in releasing the world's natural resources, to help build infrastructure and generate the energy we need to live in a modern world.\n\nThrough Incitec Pivot Fertilisers' 100-year heritage in Australian agriculture, IPL plays an important role in enabling sustainable food production to meet the rapidly rising demand for food around the world.\n\nThe Company has operations in Australia, North America, Europe, Asia, Latin America and Africa.\n\n## Dyno Nobel Americas\n\nThe Dyno Nobel Americas business comprises three businesses:\n\n- \u00bb Explosives;\n- \u00bb Agriculture & Industrial Chemicals; and\n- \u00bb Waggaman operations.\n\n## Explosives\n\nDyno Nobel provides ammonium nitrate, initiating systems and services to the Quarry & Construction sector across the US; the Base & Precious Metals sector in the US mid-West, US West, Canada and Chile; and to the Coal sector in the Powder River Basin, Illinois Basin and Appalachia.\n\nIn North America, Dyno Nobel manufactures ammonium nitrate at its Cheyenne, Wyoming and Louisiana, Missouri plants. The Cheyenne, Wyoming plant is adjacent to the Powder River Basin, North America's most competitive thermal coal mining region and is well positioned to service Base & Precious Metals in Western US. The Louisiana, Missouri plant has a competitive logistic footprint from which to support mining in both the Illinois Basin and Appalachia, as well as Quarry & Construction in the US mid-West, where it is the market leader.\n\nInitiating systems are manufactured at Dyno Nobel's facilities in Connecticut, Kentucky, Illinois, Missouri, Chile and Mexico, and are also sourced from DetNet South Africa (Pty) Ltd (DetNet), an IPL electronics joint venture.\n\n## Agriculture & Industrial Chemicals\n\nThe Dyno Nobel Americas business manufactures and distributes nitrogen-based fertilisers in the United States from its St Helens, Oregon and Cheyenne, Wyoming plants.\n\n## Waggaman Operations\n\nThe Dyno Nobel Americas business manufactures and distributes ammonia at its Waggaman, Louisiana plant in the United States. Ammonia produced at Waggaman is used in Dyno Nobel's manufacturing process and is also sold to third parties under long term contractual arrangements. On 20 March 2023, IPL entered into an agreement for the sale of the Waggaman plant to CF Industries Holdings, Inc. for a total value of US$1.675bn. The sale remains subject to US anti-trust regulatory clearance and the completion of other customary closing conditions.\n\n## Dyno Nobel Asia Paci/fic\n\nThrough Dyno Nobel Asia Paci/fic, IPL provides ammonium nitrate based industrial explosives, initiating systems and services to the Metallurgical Coal and Base & Precious Metals sectors in Australia, and internationally to a number of countries including Indonesia, France, Papua New Guinea and Turkey through its subsidiaries and joint ventures. Ammonium nitrate is often sold in conjunction with proprietary initiating systems and services.\n\nDyno Nobel is the second largest industrial explosives distributor in Australia by volume, which in turn is the world's third largest industrial explosives market. In Australia, Dyno Nobel primarily supplies its products to metallurgical coal mines in the east and to iron ore mines in the west.\n\nIn Australia, Dyno Nobel manufactures ammonium nitrate at its Moranbah ammonium nitrate plant, which is located in the Bowen Basin, the world's premier metallurgical coal region. It also sources third party ammonium nitrate including in Western Australia to service the Iron ore and Underground sectors.\n\nInitiating systems are manufactured in Australia at Dyno Nobel's Helidon, Queensland facility and are also sourced from IPL facilities in the Americas and from DetNet (South African joint venture).\n\nThe Titanobel business, which was acquired in FY22, is highly complementary to Dyno Nobel's existing operations and provides access to new markets where Dyno Nobel can leverage its premium technology o/ffering. Titanobel is a leading industrial explosives manufacturer and drilling, blasting and technical services provider based in France.\n\n## Fertilisers Asia Paci/fic\n\nIPL's Fertilisers business in Australia is the largest domestic manufacturer and supplier of fertilisers by volume.\n\nInternationally, the Fertilisers business sells to major o/ffshore agricultural markets in Asia Paci/fic, the Indian subcontinent, Brazil and the United States. It also procures fertilisers from overseas manufacturers to meet domestic seasonal peaks.  Much of this activity is conducted through Southern Cross Fertilisers Pte. Ltd., a Singapore based subsidiary.\n\nThe Fertilisers business manufactures the following fertilisers at two locations:\n\n- \u00bb Phosphate Hill: Di/mono-ammonium phosphate (DAP/MAP);\n- \u00bb Geelong: Single Super Phosphate (SSP).\n\nIn January 2023, IPL ceased production of ammonia at its Gibson Island plant. IPL continues to investigate alternative purposes for the site, including the potential production of green ammonia.",

IMIs) of $582m, a decrease of 43% compared to $1,027m in the pcp. Refer to the FY23 Business Review section for an analysis of business performance.\n\n## Individually Material Items (IMIs)\n\nNPAT for FY23 includes $22m (FY22 $13m) of after-tax IMIs relating to:\n\n- \u00bb costs incurred to optimally position IPF for standalone operation, whether this be in preparation for sale, demerger or as a separately managed business within the IPL Group ($13m): and,\n- \u00bb costs incurred to e/ffect the sale of the WALA operations, including advisory fees, legal, accounting and tax advice ($9m).\n\n## Capital Management\n\nEarnings per share (EPS) ex IMIs of 30.0 cents per share decreased by 22.9 cents per share compared to FY22 EPS of 52.9 cents.\n\nDue to IPL being in the possession of market sensitive information relating to asset sale transactions, the Company was unable to commence the previously announced on-market share buyback of up to $400 million.\n\nIPL remains committed to executing the $400m on-market buyback and aims to get the program underway as soon as it has the next permissible trading window.\n\nIPL has su/fficient cash reserves and committed bank facilities to complete the buyback. The share buyback will be conducted in the ordinary course of trading and the exact amount and timing of share purchases will be dependent on regulatory requirements and market conditions.\n\nShould the sale of the Waggaman facility complete successfully, IPL would seek to return an additional $1bn to shareholders via a combination of a $500m pro-rata capital return and an additional $500m on-market share buyback. It is expected that a portion of the proposed pro-rata capital return would be in the form of an unfranked dividend. Final con/firmation of the size of the dividend component remains subject to con/firmation by the Australian Tax O/ffice.\n\nThese additional returns of capital, if they are to occur, would require shareholder approval. IPL intends to include resolutions in the notice of meeting for the upcoming Annual General Meeting scheduled for 20 December 2023 requesting approval to undertake these proposed returns of capital should the sale of Waggaman successfully complete.\n\nThese capital returns are in line with IPL's Capital Allocation Framework which aims to enhance shareholder value through optimising its weighted average cost of capital while retaining an appropriately strong credit pro/file in support of its investment grade credit ratings.\n\n## Net Debt\n\nNet debt increased by $379m to $1,415m at 30 September 2023 (pcp: $1,036m) and Net Debt/EBITDA ex IMIs increased to 1.2x (pcp: 0.5x). Net debt increased during the year mainly as a result of investments in sustenance (including turnarounds) and minor growth projects ($470m) and dividends paid to shareholders ($524m) o/ffsetting $701m of operating cash/flows. The Group's investment grade credit ratings were maintained:\n\n- \u00bb S&P: BBB (stable outlook)\n- \u00bb Moody's: Baa2 (stable outlook)\n\n## Zero Harm\n\nIPL's Total Recordable Injury Frequency Rate (6) (TRIFR) for the rolling twelve-month period ended 30 September 2023 was 0.91, largely in line with the 0.92 (7) at 30 September 2022. There were 14 Process Safety Incidents (8) recorded in FY23 (pcp:25). The Company maintained its strong environmental safety record with FY23 being the third year in a row without a Signi/ficant Environmental Incident (9) .\n\nA /final dividend of 5 cents per share (unfranked) has been announced. When combined with the FY23 interim dividend of 10 cents per share, this represents a 50% payout ratio of NPAT (excl. IMIs) on a full year basis.",

Earnings in the Dyno Nobel Explosives businesses grew strongly in the second half, bene/fiting from customer price increases, higher margin technology uptake and improved cost control. Volumes in the Fertiliser Distribution business recovered well from a weather impacted /first half with margins also improving. Major movements for the year were as follows:\n\nGibson Island Closure: As previously disclosed, the Gibson Island plant ceased manufacturing activities in January 2023 and no further manufacturing activity is expected from this asset in its current state. As a result of very high commodity prices in the prior year (FY22) the year on year movement in earnings from the closure of the plant is $144m.\n\nDepreciation - WALA sale: Per the market announcement in March 2023, IPL reached an agreement for the sale of its ammonia manufacturing facility located in Waggaman, Louisiana, USA (Waggaman). For accounting purposes, the Waggaman assets were classi/fied as Held-for-sale at the end of November 2022. As such, depreciation on the asset base ceased at this point, resulting in a depreciation bene/fit of $56m compared to the pcp.\n\nCommodity Prices & Foreign Exchange: The majority of the $612m impact on earnings from movements in commodity prices and foreign exchange movements related to the Fertiliser business and Waggaman ammonia facility. DAP, Urea and Ammonia prices all fell signi/ficantly during the year with falls between 27% and 34% compared to pcp. The positive translation impact on the DNA earnings driven by a lower AUD:USD exchange rate during the year was $44m.\n\nAmericas Explosives: The $10m improvement in earnings was the result of customer and technology growth in the higher margin Q&C and Metals markets, which was partially o/ffset by reduced demand in the coal sector. Cost management initiatives and customer price increases more than o/ffset increased costs from above average in/flation. The full bene/fit of these initiatives is expected to realise in FY24. The improved customer mix, increased customer uptake of technology and services and cost management initiatives contributed to signi/ficant margin expansion in the second half with margins improving to 12.8% in 2H compared to 10.6% in 1H.\n\nAsia Paci/fic Explosives: Dyno Nobel's premium technology suite, particularly electronic detonators and Di/fferential Energy emulsions, generated a $13m earnings improvement compared to the pcp. The positive customer response to Dyno Nobel's premium technology was clearly demonstrated by the 5-year renewal of Dyno's contract with FMG which includes a unique technology alliance. Positive customer re-contracting outcomes and favourable market conditions in Turkey and Indonesia contributed a further $15m to the FY23 result. The Titanobel acquisition continues to deliver against the acquisition business case with an additional $6m contribution from this business compared to the pcp.\n\nAsia Paci/fic Fertilisers: Despite a slow /first half, domestic fertiliser sales volumes increased 9% year on year as strong demand in the second half was driven by lower fertiliser prices and favourable farming conditions. However, earnings in the Distribution business were down $6m compared to the pcp. The rapidly falling price of fertilisers during the year adversely impacted EBIT margin per tonne as product was being sold into a declining market. The recovery in sales volumes seen in the second half has provided good momentum going into FY24.\n\n## Phosphate Hill\n\nCost of Gas : As was the case for a large portion of FY22, Phosphate Hill's contracted gas supply was disrupted throughout the year due to the underperformance of a third-party provider. As a result, gas was purchased through optimising across short term contract arrangements and spot purchases. The incremental cost of these purchases, when compared to the pcp was $38m bringing the total FY23 impact to $79m which is at the lower end of the range previously announced (FY22 included an incremental gas cost of $41m). IPL expects that shortfall gas will be required in FY24, with the cost expected to be approximately $45m lower than the cost in FY23.\n\nReliability : Phosphate Hill AP production for FY23 was impacted by a number of unplanned outages during the year (refer to Manufacturing Reliability section below for overall EBIT impact). This includes an incident within the ammonia plant's pressure swing adsorption unit during the /final weeks of FY23.  As a result, planned maintenance work originally scheduled for FY24 was brought forward to be conducted with the repair works from the September 2023 incident. The plant is expected to return to full production rates at the end of November with FY24 production estimated to be between 810kmt and 840kmt. Similar to when we resolved the Waggaman reliability issues, a taskforce has been established at Phosphate Hill which will be focused on ensuring the plant meets these expectations and returns to safe and reliable operations.",

        "page_content": "Turnarounds: Year on year manufacturing performance includes a production bene/fit ($74m) due to the prior year including the planned turnaround at Phosphate Hill. Planned Turnarounds were completed during FY23 at the St Helens, Oregon plant, the Louisiana, Missouri facility and Cheyenne, Wyoming with a combined earnings impact of $17m. There are no major turnarounds planned in FY24. However, planned maintenance is scheduled at Phosphate Hill for 1H24 to conduct required maintenance activities that will bene/fit longer term reliability.\n\nManufacturing Reliability: Manufacturing reliability improvements were largely driven by an excellent operating performance by the Waggaman facility ($91m), partially o/ffset by manufacturing interruptions at Phosphate Hill ($47m). Moranbah achieved record annual production in FY23 which underpinned a strong DNAP result. Several improvement actions will be implemented in FY24 to further improve overall reliability on all IPL plants, including implementing a taskforce at Phosphate Hill.\n\n## Financial Position\n\n|                                           | Year ended 30 September   | Year ended 30 September   | Year ended 30 September   |\n|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|\n| Balance Sheet  A$m                        | 30 Sep  2023              | 30 Sep  2022              | Change  A$m               |\n| Assets                                    |                           |                           |                           |\n| TWC - Fertilisers APAC                    | 69.8                      | 104.6                     | (34.8)                    |\n| TWC - Dyno Nobel                          | 503.9                     | 511.3                     | (7.4)                     |\n| Group TWC                                 | 573.7                     | 615.9                     | (42.2)                    |\n| Net PP&E                                  | 3,191.4                   | 4,246.9                   | (1,055.5)                 |\n| Lease assets                              | 209.3                     | 221.0                     | (11.7)                    |\n| Intangible assets                         | 2,394.4                   | 3,281.4                   | (887.0)                   |\n| Net Assets classi/fied as held for sale   | 2,207.3                   | -                         | 2,207.3                   |\n| Net other assets                          | 197.1                     | 144.6                     | 52.5                      |\n| Total Assets                              | 8,773.2                   | 8,509.8                   | 263.4                     |\n| Liabilities                               |                           |                           |                           |\n| Environmental & restructure liabilities   | (154.7)                   | (248.7)                   | 94.0                      |\n| Tax liabilities                           | (542.1)                   | (689.3)                   | 147.2                     |\n| Lease liabilities                         | (234.7)                   | (245.9)                   | 11.2                      |\n| Net debt                                  | (1,415.0)                 | (1,036.2)                 | (378.8)                   |\n| Total Liabilities                         | (2,346.5)                 | (2,220.1)                 | (126.4)                   |\n| Net Assets                                | 6,426.7                   | 6,289.7                   | 137.0                     |\n| Equity                                    | 6,426.7                   | 6,289.7                   | 137.0                     |\n| Key Performance Indicators                |                           |                           |                           |\n| Net Tangible Assets per Share             | 1.60                      | 1.55                      |                           |\n| Fertilisers APAC - Ave TWC % Rev (1)      | 20.8%                     | 17.2%                     |                           |\n| Dyno Nobel - Ave TWC % Rev (1)            | 18.9%                     | 16.0%                     |                           |\n| Group - Ave TWC % Rev (1)                 | 19.6%                     | 16.5%                     |                           |\n| ROIC (including Goodwill)                 | 7.5%                      | 13.8%                     |                           |\n| ROIC (excluding Goodwill)                 | 11.3%                     | 20.9%                     |                           |\n| Credit Metrics                            |                           |                           |                           |\n| Net debt (2)                              | (1,415.0)                 | (1,036.2)                 |                           |\n| Net debt incl TWC facilities / EBITDA (3) | 1.4x                      | 0.7x                      |                           |\n| Net debt / EBITDA (4)                     | 1.2x                      | 0.5x                      |                           |\n| Interest Cover (5)                        | 9.9x                      | 20.3x                     |                           |\n\nMajor movements in the Group's Balance Sheet during the year include:\n\n## Assets\n\nTrade Working Capital (TWC): Net decrease of $42m. The movement was mainly due to lower commodity prices in both the Fertilisers and Dyno Nobel businesses, partially o/ffset by international business growth.\n\nThe Dyno Nobel business average trade working capital (excluding the impact of /financing facilities) as a percentage of sales increased from 16.0% in FY22 to 18.9% in FY23 largely driven by international business growth and elevated commodity prices in FY22 resulting in a temporarily lower ratio in the prior year with higher revenue balances in the AG&IC business and Waggaman operations compared to inventory balances. The FY23 working capital to revenue ratio in the Dyno Nobel business is more aligned to FY21 levels with international business growth being o/ffset by working capital initiatives.\n\nThe Fertilisers business average trade working capital (excluding the impact of /financing facilities) as a percentage of sales increased from 16.5% in FY22 to 19.6% in FY23 largely driven by the Gibson Island closure (circa 1.2% percentage point change); the impact of selling high-cost product into a falling commodity price market and lower export revenue in FY23 driven by lower commodity prices.\n\nSeveral initiatives are underway to continue to optimise trade working capital metrics during FY24.\n\nNet Property, Plant & Equipment (PP&E): Decrease of $1,056m. Mainly driven by the reclassi/fication of WALA assets to held-forsale of $1,247m and depreciation of $263m. This was partially o/ffset by sustenance and turnaround capital expenditure of $302m and growth, sustainability and strategic capital spend of $193m.\n\nIntangible Assets: Decrease of $887m. Mainly driven by the reclassi/fication of WALA intangibles to held-for-sale of $881m (primarily goodwill allocated to the WALA operations). Amortisation charges for the year were mostly o/ffset by minor additions.\n\nNet other assets: Increase of $53m. Mainly due to a reduction in short-term and long-term incentive accruals ($23m), an increase in equity accounted investments given improved pro/fitability ($23m) and a reduction in capital creditors ($8m).\n\n## Liabilities\n\nEnvironmental & restructure liabilities: Decrease of $94m. Mainly driven by spend against provisions for the year of $76m, associated with the cessation of manufacturing at Gibson Island.\n\nNet Debt: Increase of $379m. Mainly due to payments related to sustenance, turnaround and strategic sustenance capital expenditure ($359m), growth and sustainability capital ($136m), lease liability payments ($51m) and dividends paid during the year ($524m). This was partially o/ffset by operating cash in/flows of $701m for the year and proceeds from sales of surplus assets. Further details of movements in Net Debt are provided in the Cash/flow section of this report.",

The increase is primarily a result of lower earnings in FY23 with EBITDA decreasing 35% over the pcp.\n\nInterest Cover: Decreased to 9.9x (pcp: 20.3x).\n\nCredit Ratings: Investment Grade credit ratings remained unchanged:\n\n- \u00bb S&P: BBB (stable outlook)\n- \u00bb Moody's: Baa2 (stable outlook)\n\n## Debt Facilities\n\nIPL has su/fficient liquidity and headroom with $801m of available undrawn committed debt facilities at 30 September 2023.\n\nThe average tenor of the Group's debt facilities at 30 September 2023 is 3.4 years (September 2022: 4.2 years). No committed debt facilities are due to mature until October 2024.\n\n## Trade Working Capital Facilities\n\nIPL uses trade working capital facilities to e/ffectively manage the Group's cash /flows, which are impacted by seasonality, demand and supply variability.\n\nThe Group has a non-recourse receivable purchasing agreement to sell certain domestic and international receivables to an unrelated entity in exchange for cash. As at 30 September 2023, receivables totaling $118m (30 September 2022: $95m) had been sold under the receivable purchasing agreement.\n\nIPL also o/ffers suppliers the opportunity to use supply chain /financing. The Group evaluates supplier arrangements against several indicators to assess whether to classify outstanding amounts as payables or borrowings. The balance of the supply chain /finance program, classi/fied as payables, at 30 September 2023 was $148m (30 September 2022: $173m).\n\n## Capital Allocation - Capital Expenditure\n\nIPL's capital allocation process is centralised and overseen by the Group's Corporate Finance function. Capital is invested on\n\na prioritised basis and all submissions are assessed against risk factors including HSE, sustainability, operational, /financial and other strategic risks. Capital is broadly categorised into /first order capital (sustenance, turnaround, strategic, sustainability and minor growth) and second order capital (major growth where the total project is expected to cost greater than $5m).\n\nThe table below includes a summary of cash spend per business on growth and sustenance capital:\n\n|                          | Year ended 30 September FY23   | Year ended 30 September FY23   | Year ended 30 September FY23   |\n|--------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|\n| IPL Group                | A$m                            | FY22  A$m                      | Change  A$m                    |\n| Capital Expenditure      |                                |                                |                                |\n| DNA                      | 103.6                          | 100.4                          | 3.2                            |\n| DNAP                     | 39.8                           | 19.5                           | 20.3                           |\n| Fertilisers              | 58.2                           | 46.6                           | 11.6                           |\n| Sustenance               | 201.6                          | 166.5                          | 35.1                           |\n| DNA                      | 97.9                           | 20.5                           | 77.4                           |\n| DNAP                     | -                              | 5.3                            | (5.3)                          |\n| Fertilisers              | 2.1                            | 87.1                           | (85.0)                         |\n| Turnaround               | 100.0                          | 112.9                          | (12.9)                         |\n| DNA                      | 27.8                           | 17.9                           | 9.9                            |\n| DNAP                     | 3.2                            | -                              | 3.2                            |\n| Fertilisers              | 26.0                           | 17.7                           | 8.3                            |\n| Strategic Sustenance     | 57.0                           | 35.6                           | 21.4                           |\n| DNA                      | 19.7                           | 22.9                           | (3.2)                          |\n| DNAP                     | 5.6                            | 4.9                            | 0.7                            |\n| Fertilisers              | 25.2                           | -                              | 25.2                           |\n| Sustainability           | 50.5                           | 27.8                           | 22.7                           |\n| DNA                      | 39.0                           | 28.7                           | 10.3                           |\n| DNAP                     | 31.0                           | 33.3                           | (2.3)                          |\n| Fertilisers              | 16.0                           | 29.2                           | (13.2)                         |\n| 1st and 2nd Order Growth | 86.0                           | 91.2                           | (5.2)                          |\n| Total                    | 495.1                          | 434.0                          | 61.1                           |\n\nThe FY23 sustenance spend was within the guidance previously provided of $180m to $220m and is used to ensure reliable operations at our manufacturing and distribution facilities in line with long term asset plans. The turnaround spend in FY23 mainly relates to LOMO, St Helens and Cheyenne.\n\nStrategic one-o/ff spend largely includes upgrades of Gibson Island distribution assets, the relocation of a research and development facility in the DNA business and Phosphate Hill mine life investment.\n\nSubject to currency /fluctuations, sustenance spend in FY24 is expected to be in the range of $180m to $200m. Turnaround spend is expected to be approximately $50m to $60m with spending on sustainability targeted to be between $20m to $30m. These amounts don't include Waggaman spend post 1 December 2023 (considering the potential sale of the assets) and one-o/ff strategic sustenance expenditure on Phosphate Hill mine life and Gibson Island distribution assets in order to return volumes to historical market share levels.\n\nSustenance spend is in/fluenced by asset management plans and strategies. IPL is focussed on improving capital e/ffectiveness and e/fficiency to ensure we deliver asset reliability and optimal returns.",

Signi/ficant movements included:\n\nEBITDA: Decreased by $642m primarily driven by net unfavourable realised commodity price and A$:US$ exchange rate movements ($612m); the cessation of manufacturing at Gibson Island ($144m) and the impact of the Phosphate Hill gas supply disruption ($38m). This was partially o/ffset by the recovery from turnarounds that occurred in FY22 compared to FY23 ($74m) and growth in the Explosives businesses ($45m).\n\nNet Interest Paid: Increased by $42m, principally as a result of higher interest rates, and lower exchange rates which were partially o/ffset by lower average borrowings.\n\nTWC Movement: Improved $418m compared to the pcp largely as a result of lower commodity prices compared to FY22.\n\nDividends received from JV's: Increased by $30m largely due to the timing of payment of dividends by joint ventures and growth in earnings from joint ventures.\n\nEnvironmental and site clean-up: Relates largely to payments against the Gibson Island closure provision.\n\nOther Non-TWC: Improved by $115m compared to the pcp. FY22 Non-TWC included the WALA insurance proceeds receivable of $35m which was paid in FY23 (representing a $70m year on year di/fferential). The remaining favourable movement was largely due to the timing of the receipt of gas security deposits.\n\n## Investing Cash Flow\n\nNet investing cash out/flows of $482m decreased $93m as compared to the pcp. Signi/ficant movements included:\n\nSustenance capital: Higher sustenance spend is mainly driven by spend on key strategic one-o/ff projects; incremental spend in the Titanobel business given a full year of ownership and the DNAP MPU upgrade program during the year.\n\nSustainability capital: Sustainability spend in FY23 primarily re/flects spend progressing decarbonisation projects at WALA and the Moranbah abatement project.\n\nAcquisition of subsidiaries and non-controlling interests: FY22 out/flow represents the acquisition of Titanobel ($124m) and Yara Nipro ($20m).\n\n## Financing Cash Flow\n\nNet /financing cash out/flow of $598m was $47m higher compared with the pcp. Signi/ficant movements included:\n\nDividends paid to members of IPL: Higher dividend of $524m in line with increased earnings in the second half of FY22.\n\nForeign Exchange on Net Debt: The non-cash increase of $18m re/flects the impact from translating US dollar denominated debt at a lower exchange rate.",

Outlined below are the major earnings movements during the year for each business segment.\n\n## Explosives\n\n## Business Performance\n\nExplosives earnings for FY23 of US$117m was US$7m higher than the pcp principally due to the following:\n\nEBIT Margins: EBIT margins (as a percentage of revenue) grew marginally during the year despite weather impacts and coal demand impacts. Margins grew materially in the back half of the year with 2H margins being 12.8%, up from 10.6% in 1H. When measured on an EBIT per tonne basis, margins grew 8% in the year primarily due to a change in the sales mix away from coal and into Metals and Q&C. This second half margin expansion is creating earnings momentum into FY24.\n\nCustomer Growth: US$6m growth comes from increased demand in the higher margin Q&C and Metals markets. The 9% volume growth in Q&C in the prior year carried forward into FY23 with a further 4% growth. Metals volumes were up 2% on pcp with the largest increases in the Chilean and Canadian operations.\n\nTechnology: Incremental earnings of US$5m came from higher sales of Dyno's premium technology products, primarily specialised emulsions in Q&C and Metals markets.\n\nCost Management / In/flation: The net result of pricing increases and cost management initiatives (including the cost of implementation) and the negative impacts of in/flationary forces had a favourable earnings impact of US$3m. Full realisation of cost saving initiatives is expected in FY24.\n\nWeather / Coal demand: Weather impacts in the /first half impacted earnings by US$4m. Declines in natural gas prices led to a reduction in end market coal demand (volumes down 5%) causing a further earnings impact of US$4m.\n\nManufacturing: Turnarounds at the Cheyenne, WY. and Louisiana, MO, plants during the year impacted earnings by US$4m. Excluding turnarounds, manufacturing performance improved year on year, contributing an earnings bene/fit of US$4m.\n\n## Market Summary\n\n## Quarry & Construction\n\n43% of Explosives revenue was generated from the Quarry & Construction sector in FY23 (42% pcp). DNA's market leading position was maintained during the period, primarily through DNA's joint venture partners and independent distributors.\n\n## Base & Precious Metals\n\n37% of Explosives revenue was generated from the Base & Precious Metals sector in FY23 (36% pcp). Volumes increased by 2% during the year with revenues (in dollar terms) up approximately 7% compared to the pcp. The largest increases in volumes came from operations in Chile and Eastern Canada, with some of those gains o/ffset by decreased volumes in the US Iron Range which was impacted by severe weather in the /first half and the idling of a key mine as previously noted.",

Volumes were down 5% versus the pcp as lower natural gas prices incentivised the power sector to switch to gasgenerated power.\n\n## Agriculture & Industrial Chemicals (Ag & IC)\n\n## Business Performance\n\nAg & IC FY23 earnings of US$9m was US$70m lower than the pcp, primarily due to the following:\n\nTurnaround: A turnaround at the St. Helens Urea plant in the /first half reduced earnings by US$4m. The major turnaround at Cheyenne in the second half resulted in a further US$3m negative impact on earnings.\n\nManufacturing Reliability: The US$10m earnings decline related to manufacturing reliability was the result of minor production issues at Cheyenne (prior to its major turnaround) combined with the previously reported equipment failure at St. Helens in the /first half (US$8m).\n\nCommodity Prices: Unfavourable movements in Urea and UAN pricing reduced earnings by US$53m versus the pcp.\n\n## Waggaman Operations\n\n|                                           | Year ended 30 September   | Year ended 30 September   | Year ended 30 September   |\n|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|\n| WAGGAMAN                                  | FY23                      | FY22                      | Change %                  |\n| Thousand metric tonne                     |                           |                           |                           |\n| Ammonia manufactured at Waggaman          | 822.5                     | 700.6                     | 17                        |\n| Ammonia sold                              | 829.6                     | 745.9                     | 11                        |\n| US$m                                      |                           |                           |                           |\n| External Revenue                          | 403.1                     | 560.9                     | (28)                      |\n| Internal Revenue                          | 53.5                      | 67.9                      | (21)                      |\n| Total Revenue                             | 456.6                     | 628.8                     | (27)                      |\n| EBIT                                      | 264.0                     | 343.8                     | (23)                      |\n| EBIT margin                               | 65.5 %                    | 61.3 %                    |                           |\n| Notes                                     |                           |                           |                           |\n| Ammonia Realised Price (US$/mt) (1)       | 550                       | 843                       |                           |\n| Realised Gas Cost (US$/mmbtu) (delivered) | 3.66                      | 6.86                      |                           |\n| Ammonia Tampa Index Price (US$/mt) (1)    | 653                       | 1,049                     |                           |\n| Index Gas Cost (US$/mmbtu) (2)            | 3.58                      | 6.54                      |                           |\n| Gas e/fficiency (mmbtu/mt)                | 34                        | 35                        |                           |\n\n## Business Performance\n\nWaggaman earnings of US$264m, decreased US$80m compared to the pcp due to the following:\n\nManufacturing Reliability: Production at the Waggaman plant exceeded nameplate capacity for the year with production of 823kmt. This was approximately 122kmt higher than the prior year which had been impacted by an incident in the /first half of that year. The additional production resulted in higher earnings of US$61m.\n\nDepreciation - WALA sale: Per the market announcement in March 2023, IPL reached an agreement for the sale of its ammonia manufacturing facility located in Waggaman, Louisiana, USA (Waggaman). For accounting purposes, the Waggaman assets were classi/fied as Held-for-sale at the end of November 2022. As such, depreciation on the asset base ceased at this point, resulting in a depreciation bene/fit of US$37m compared to the pcp.\n\nCommodity Prices: Global ammonia prices reduced during the year from the historically high levels seen in FY22. Lower natural gas prices partially o/ffset this unfavourable movement resulting in a net unfavourable earnings impact of US$177m.\n\nThe discount realised on sales priced at the Tampa benchmark in FY23 was approximately 10%. The net discount on sales, including internal sales to Dyno Nobel, Louisiana, MO facility was approximately 14%.",

Recontracting is ahead of schedule with pricing discipline maintained.\n\nTechnology Growth: $13m growth on the pcp, driven by strong electronics and Di/fferential Energy emulsion volumes.\n\nTitanobel: $6m growth on the pcp, mostly driven by annualisation bene/fit with a full year of earnings in FY23. Business integration and synergy realisation progressing in line with the acquisition plan.\n\nMoranbah Plant: Production was 1kmt higher than pcp. with the impact of the closure of Gibson Island being o/ffset by increased plant reliability and gas e/fficiencies. The $9m earnings impact is largely driven by higher manufacturing cost due to the closure of Gibson Island.\n\nThe EBIT margin decline versus pcp is due to the proportional increase in earnings of the lower margin Titanobel business, included for a full year for the /first time.\n\n## Market Summary\n\n## Australian Coal\n\n37% of Dyno Nobel Asia Paci/fic revenue for the year was generated from the Australian Coal sector, most of which was from supply to the metallurgical coal mines in the Bowen Basin.\n\nVolumes from the Australian Coal sector remained relatively /flat compared to the pcp. Metallurgical Coal volumes recovered in the second half of the year after a weather impacted /first half.\n\n## Base & Precious Metals\n\n37% of Dyno Nobel Asia Paci/fic revenue was generated from the Base & Precious Metals sector, which comprises iron ore mines in Western Australia and hard rock and underground mines throughout Australia.\n\nVolumes from the sector increased 4% compared to the pcp as a result of the increased adoption of Di/fferential Energy emulsion.\n\n## International\n\n26% of Dyno Nobel Asia Paci/fic revenue was generated internationally in Indonesia, Turkey, Papua New Guinea and France.\n\nVolumes increased by 32% compared to the pcp, mainly driven by the annualisation of the acquisition of the Titanobel business, and stronger volumes in the Indonesia business.\n\n## Titanobel\n\nFollowing the business acquisition In May 2022, the primary focus for 2023 has been on successfully integrating Titanobel into the Group. The growth trajectory of the business remains consistent with the acquisition plan and several synergy opportunities have been identi/fied.\n\n## Manufacturing\n\nA record-breaking volume year for Moranbah, producing 372k mt of ammonium nitrate during the year despite the Gibson Island closure. Ammonia Plant reliability improved to 96% following a strong second half performance.",

Major movements for the year were due to the following:\n\nGibson Island Closure: As previously disclosed, the Gibson Island plant ceased manufacturing activities in January 2023. The resulting decrease in production resulted in a year on year decrease in earnings of approximately $135m.\n\nCommodity Prices: $309m net decrease, primarily driven by lower DAP prices.\n\n## Phosphate Hill\n\nCost of Gas : Gas supply disruptions at Phosphate Hill increased FY23 gas costs by $38m compared with the prior year (FY22 included increased gas costs of ~A$41m as a result of gas supply disruptions) bringing the total FY23 impact to $79m which is at the lower end of the previously announced range. IPL expects that shortfall gas will be required in FY24, with the cost expected to be approximately $45m lower than the cost in FY23.\n\nReliability : Manufacturing reliability was impacted by manufacturing interruptions at Phosphate Hill ($47m). IPL has implemented a Taskforce at Phosphate Hill to address and implement recommendations to improve reliability.\n\nYear on year manufacturing performance includes a production bene/fit ($74m) due to the prior year including the planned turnaround at Phosphate Hill.\n\nVolumes and Margins: Distribution volumes increased in the second half, primarily due to higher demand led by lower fertiliser pricing and favourable farming conditions. Distribution EBIT margin per tonne was impacted by a falling commodity price market in FY23. The focus for FY24 is on accretive market share growth.\n\n## Market Summary\n\nTotal Fertilisers Asia Paci/fic domestic sales volumes of 2,036k metric tonnes (mt) was 9% higher than FY22 sales of 1,869k mt. Volume growth re/flects the strong trading conditions in the second half of FY23.\n\nGlobal fertiliser prices retracted from unprecedented levels in the prior year. Realised Ammonium Phosphate (AP) prices declined by 31% and realised Urea prices were down 27% over the pcp.",

        "page_content": "## Manufacturing\n\nManufacturing performance in the Fertilisers Asia Paci/fic business in FY23 was as follows:\n\n## Phosphate Hill\n\nAP production increased to 864k mt, up 17% on pcp. The higher production re/flects the recovery from the planned turnaround in the prior year, partially o/ffset by unplanned outages in FY23.\n\nAmmonium Phosphate cost per tonne increased marginally in FY23 largely due to higher gas costs, partially o/ffset by a reduction in the cost of sulphur.\n\n## Outlook and Sensitivities\n\nIPL does not generally provide pro/fit guidance, primarily due to the earnings variability resulting from commodity price and foreign exchange movements. Instead, IPL provides an outlook for business performance expectations and sensitivities to key earnings drivers based on management's current view at the time of this report.\n\n## Outlook\n\n## Dyno Nobel Asia Paci/fic\n\n- \u00bb Positive market conditions expected to remain in Australia including /firm, short-term demand outlook for coal and iron ore, and a tightening AN market.\n- \u00bb Customer recontracting is progressing well in Australia with some key contracts executed during FY23 (e.g. FMG) and the remainder of the customer book to be renewed or to expire in FY24 and 1H FY25. Recontracting is expected to support the base DNAP business to return to peak earnings by 1H FY25 with further upside expected from the delivery of the Titanobel business case.\n- \u00bb Moranbah production forecast expected to be approximately 330kmt in FY24 compared to 372kmt in FY23 largely due to the closure of Gibson Island resulting in a reduction of available Ammonia (~$11m impact) and the N2O abatement project scheduled for 1HFY24 (~$5m impact).\n- \u00bb Continuation of Titanobel earnings growth, consistent with the acquisition business case and synergy realisation opportunities.\n- \u00bb Technology growth expected through the expansion of premium Di/fferential Energy emulsion and continued uptake of premium electronic detonator technology.\n- \u00bb The /first half / second half earnings split is again expected to be weighted towards the second half (historic split of circa 45%/55%).\n\n## Dyno Nobel Americas\n\n## Explosives\n\n- \u00bb Within the context of a highly competitive market, the base Explosives business (excluding any impact from the WALA o/fftake agreement) expects mid to high single digit earnings growth. The following factors contribute to this outcome:\n- \u203a The full /flow through of price increases, underlying market growth (net of coal decline) and technology driven market share gains is expected to generate year on year earnings improvements in the base explosives business.\n- \u203a Expected higher AN production, principally resulting from not having any planned turnaround activities in FY24.\n- \u203a Depreciation expense will be approximately US$12m higher in FY24, mainly as a result of the capital expenditure associated with the Cheyenne, WY turnaround in FY23.\n- \u203a The /first half / second half earnings split for FY24 is expected to be in line with prior years at approximately 45% / 55%.\n\n## AG&IC\n\n- \u00bb Agriculture & Industrial Chemicals earnings (excluding any impact from the WALA o/fftake agreement) are expected to be largely in line with FY23 with expected positive manufacturing impacts being o/ffset by lower UAN and Urea prices. Commodity prices are subject to market volatility and could result in a di/fferent outcome.\n\n## WALA\n\n- \u00bb The WALA sale remains contingent on US anti-trust regulatory clearance. A decision of the regulator is expected before the end of the 2023 calendar year.\n- \u00bb Apart from a potential outage of up to 4 weeks to allow the installation of a replacement cooler the Waggaman plant is expected to produce at nameplate capacity in FY24. The operational earnings of Waggaman remain subject to movements in ammonia and natural gas prices.\n- \u00bb Tampa Discount - Until the sale of the Waggaman facility is completed, third party ammonia sales from the plant will continue to be sold under the existing contracts. The average discount to Tampa for third party sales is expected to be between 8% and 10%. When factoring in 'internal' sales, which are not priced based o/ff the Tampa benchmark, the overall discount is expected to be between 12% and 15% in FY24.\n\n## WALA o/fftake agreement\n\n- \u00bb Following the completion of the sale of the Waggaman facility, an asset representing the value of the 25-year ammonia o/fftake agreement will be recognised on the day of the sale. The value of this asset is currently estimated to be approximately US$300m.  This asset will be amortised via a non-cash charge to the P&L annually, partially o/ffsetting the uplift in margin which is expected to be captured in the Explosives and AG&IC result.\n- \u00bb The manufacturing margin associated with the sale of 150k short tonnes of ammonia to LOMO will transfer to the DNA Explosives business (estimated annual bene/fit of ~$8m, net of amortisation) and the bene/fit of an additional 50k short tonnes of ammonia is expected to be captured in the AG&IC business (estimated annual bene/fit of ~$6m, net of amortisation), replacing previous purchased tonnes at Cheyenne (this is subject to the volumes manufactured). This margin remains subject to movements in ammonia and natural gas prices.\n- Refer to slide 35 of IPL's FY23 Investor Presentation for further information on the P&L impact of the WALA o/fftake agreement.\n\n## Fertilisers Asia Paci/fic\n\n- \u00bb Fertiliser's earnings will continue to be dependent on global fertiliser prices, the A$:US$ exchange rate and weather conditions.\n- \u00bb Distribution is forecasting value accretive market share gains for FY24.\n- \u00bb With the Australian Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) recently announcing that 'Oceanic indicators /firmly exhibit an El Ni\u00f1o state', expectations are for reduced spring rainfall in Eastern Australia. This may lead to lower demand for fertiliser in this region and potentially impact the overall market size.\n- \u00bb Phosphate Hill production was impacted by interruptions that occurred in late FY23 and carried forward into October 2023. The FY24 production range for Phosphate Hill is forecasted between 810k mt to 840k mt principally as a result of planned maintenance activities in 1H24 required to conduct repairs and other work to increase site reliability over the period and into the future. Depreciation is expected to increase by approximately $5m as a result of reliability capital investment.",

        "page_content": "- \u00bb As a result of the planned outages, production at Phosphate Hill in FY24 is expected to be lower in the /first half with approximately 35% to 40% of the full year production forecast to be delivered during this period.\n- \u00bb Phosphate Hill gas - during the three months to the end of September 2023, Phosphate Hill used a mix of supply sources including; gas supplied under the current contract from Power and Water Corporation (PWC), and shortfall gas from Northern Territory and East Coast suppliers. The diversity in gas supply ensured Phosphate Hill production was not a/ffected by the reduction of contracted gas supply from PWC. The price of these shortfall gas volumes is expected to be approximately $45m lower than the cost incurred in FY23 (which was $79m). A further update will be provided at half year.\n- \u00bb Production of fertilisers at Gibson Island ceased in early January 2023. Earnings from Gibson Island manufacturing in FY23 was approximately $20m.\n\n## Group\n\nCorporate: Corporate costs are expected to be approximately $42m in FY24.\n\nBorrowing Costs: Net borrowing costs for FY24 will be impacted by the timing of potential proceeds from the sale of the Waggaman facility and/or the sale of the Fertilisers business. Borrowing costs will also be impacted by the size and timing of any returns of capital to shareholders. Based on an assumption that the WALA sale completes in December 2023 and that $1.4bn of capital returns take place across FY24 and FY25, interest expense in FY24 is forecast to be $115m.\n\nTaxation: IPL's e/ffective tax rate for FY24, excluding IMI's and assuming the sale of the Waggaman ammonia facility completes during the year, is expected to be between 12% and 17%. The lower range compared to FY23 is largely due to the potential sale of Waggaman which results in permanent di/fference deductions (for example JV income) representing a higher portion of pro/fits compared to FY23.  The tax rate range is highly sensitive to earnings mix movements across jurisdictions.\n\nHedging: Approximately 85% of the FY24 US$ linked fertilisers sales remain unhedged, with 15% hedged at 73 cents with full participation down to 60 cents.\n\n## Sensitivities\n\nThe table provides sensitivities to key earnings drivers and should be read in conjunction with the footnotes found below.\n\n| Commodity                               | Proxy Index             | EBIT Sensitivities                                                                                |\n|-----------------------------------------|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| WALA                                    |                         |                                                                                                   |\n| Ammonia (1)                             | CFR Tampa               | + / - US$10/mt = +/-U$6.0m    + / - US$0.10/mmbtu = -/+ US$2.0m     + / - A$/US$0.01 = -/+ A$6.0m |\n| Natural Gas (2) FX EBIT Translation (3) | Henry Hub               |                                                                                                   |\n| Americas excluding WALA                 | Americas excluding WALA | Americas excluding WALA                                                                           |\n| Urea (4)                                | FOB NOLA                | + / - US$10/mt = +/-U$1.8m                                                                        |\n| FX EBIT Translation (5)                 |                         | + / - A$/US$0.01 = -/+ A$2.8m                                                                     |\n| Asia Paci/fic                           |                         |                                                                                                   |\n| AP (6)                                  | FOB China/Saudi         | + / - US$10/mt = +/-A$13.1m                                                                       |\n| FX EBIT Transactional (6)               |                         | + / - A$/US$0.01 = -/+A$11.6m                                                                     |\n\n## Sustainability\n\nIPL's commitment to operating sustainably is driven by the Company's values which are core to the way it does business.

It's a commitment we make to employees, contractors, customers, shareholders, and the community. Our Zero Harm strategy enshrines our approach to keeping people and the environment safe. Our four strategic themes - Simplify, Get the Fundamentals Right, Lead & Engage and Strengthen our Learning Culture underpin our annual execution plans and focus our e/fforts.\n\nWhilst robust health and safety management standards and systems are set at a global level, accountability for safety outcomes is owned by local teams. We empower, develop, and expect everyone to be leaders in Zero Harm. Employees are empowered to stop work or speak-up if they believe something is unsafe. It is our belief that we all share the responsibility for safety. The wellbeing of our people also continued as a focus with emphasis on occupational and mental health.\n\n## Safety performance\n\nIn FY23 we continued to progress our ambition to achieve industry leading performance in occupational health, personal safety, process safety and reducing our impact on the environment. Our overall performance included a number of positive results however some critical areas need continued focus, and we remain committed to pursuing year on year improvement in our Zero Harm Ambition.\n\nThe Total Recordable Injury Frequency Rate (TRIFR) (1) has plateaued (over the last three years) with a Group TRIFR of 0.91 in FY23, above the target of 0.7. The Group has achieved zero serious harm (2) injuries in FY23, zero fatalities for the past three years and a 36% reduction in the lost workday case severity rate over the last two years. Integration of key IPL systems and processes has continued for Titanobel and with baseline reporting now established, Titanobel's inclusion in Group reporting will commence in FY24.\n\nThe Group focus continues to be on improving personal safety performance through maintaining operating discipline of our safety fundamentals, creating a mentally healthy workplace, e/ffective visible safety leadership with powerful safety conversations, and targeted injury reduction programs such as our Line of Fire campaign. Our global leadership and behavioural SafeTEAMS program - as part of our overall safety program - has also continued to enable improvements in personal safety performance and creating SafeGround. This supports psychological safety and enables our people to 'stop the job' and improve reporting. Excellent safety performance has been achieved throughout our FY23 plant major turnarounds and Gibson Island manufacturing plant closure.\n\nWe have been able to sustain our excellent environmental performance with Zero Signi/ficant Environmental Incidents (3) . This has been achieved through continued embedding of key environmental compliance initiatives and the launch of our inaugural World Environment Day campaign focused on raising awareness of our environmental fundamentals.\n\nProcess Safety Incidents have signi/ficantly decreased with 14 Tier 1 and Tier 2 events (4) reported in FY23 compared to 25 last year, delivering a year-on-year improvement of 44%. There were two\n\nTier 1 events in FY23 (compared to six in FY22) resulting in a 67% year-on-year reduction. This substantial improvement re/flects an increased and structured focus on the prevention of signi/ficant process safety events through the implementation of Operations Risk Management (ORM) and through the e/ffective sharing and embedding of learnings from internal and external events.\n\nThe targeted performance in signi/ficant event management for investigations completed and actions closed out on time was achieved.

In support of this we have:\n\n- \u00bb Continued the rollout of our behavioural safety program - SafeTEAMS . SafeTEAMS is a game changing program, with psychological safety - known as Safe Ground - as one of its core concepts.\n- \u00bb In partnership with the People and HSEC functions, created a psychosocial risk management program , which is a proactive approach to creating a mentally healthy workplace. The program explores factors in work design and social conditions that may lead to psychological harm.\n- \u00bb Updated our Upstander program to re/flect changes from the Respect at Work bill.\n- \u00bb Continued our work on diversity, equity and inclusion , a key aspect of creating a mentally healthy workplace.\n\n## Inclusive Culture\n\nAt IPL we believe we are stronger with a diverse group of employees working in an environment that is equitable and inclusive. Our aim is to foster a workplace where our people's di/fferences are respected, valued and leveraged and, in turn, strengthens individual and team performance. In 2023, our Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) strategy was refreshed to take a broader and more holistic view of DEI.\n\nThree key focus areas were established in the refreshed strategy to accelerate DEI:\n\n- 1. People: increasing diverse representation through deliberate, /fit for purpose actions that improve recruitment and retention outcomes\n- 2. Leaders: equipping our leaders to lead DEI by having clear expectations, building their capability and holding them accountable for outcomes\n- 3. Culture: leveraging the diversity of our workforce through an equitable and inclusive culture where we align behaviours, our management systems, and symbols\n\nActions to support a more diverse, equitable and inclusive culture are below:\n\n## Facilities review\n\nEstablished a review process to identify and improve the safety,\n\nequity and inclusiveness of our physical work environments. This involves reviewing areas such as equitable bathroom facilities, ensuring protective personal equipment (PPE) accommodates physical and cultural di/fferences, and physical accessibility. Reviews have been completed across a number of our operational sites, with further reviews planned in FY24.\n\n## Equity and Inclusion Reviews of core people processes\n\nCommenced a review to identify and implement improvements to equity and inclusion in our core people processes. This involved a review of our recruitment and performance & reward processes. This work is planned to continue in FY24.\n\n## De/fined expectations of an inclusive leader\n\nOur leaders play a critical role in creating an inclusive workplace. It's important that they understand DEI, its drivers and the value it brings to a company. Work was completed to de/fine what it means to be an inclusive leader at IPL. Next steps are to educate our leaders on these expectations and embed them in our people processes.\n\n## High-Performance Culture\n\nIPL commenced work to enhance a culture of high-performance, with the aim of aligning everything we do to delivering our safety, business and strategic objectives. This work is guided by four principles of being safe, focused, realistic and delivering. The Executive Team and senior leaders have begun aligning how we behave, our management systems and our symbols to these guiding principles.\n\n## Behaviours\n\nTo support a safe, inclusive, and high-performance culture, having leaders capable of leading our culture is key.\n\nOur /first global leadership program, Leadership Foundations, continued and was extended to more senior leaders to support the embedding of fundamental leadership tools consistently across all levels of the organisation. There is work planned on a globally aligned leadership program to build capability for more senior levels in the organisation.\n\n## Management systems\n\nThe team identi/fied the need to align a number of core business processes and systems to enable a high-performance culture across safety, people management, /financial and stakeholder systems. For example, aligning our performance and reward processes to the company's overall safety, business and strategic objectives.\n\n## Symbols\n\nWe implemented a number of communication channels within our business to ensure the culture we are building is well understood and highly visible. This has included increased frequency of townhalls where performance against our objectives is clearly communicated along with expectations of how we work to our guiding principles of being safe, focused, realistic and delivering.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Our use of natural resources in 2023\n\n## Energy and GHG\n\nThe manufacture of nitrogen-based products is energy intensive as it requires natural gas as both an energy source and a raw material for hydrogen, with carbon dioxide being liberated during manufacturing. For this reason, the production of these essential agricultural and mining products is currently based on a hard-to-abate chemical process.\n\nDuring 2023, we progressed four key projects which support our Net Zero Pathway. These are discussed in the Climate Change section.\n\nWe also made signi/ficant progress on managing our scope 3 GHG emissions. We have now fully mapped the scope 3 GHG across the value chains of each of our businesses and have identi/fied management strategies and key enablers to reduce each source. For more detail on our decarbonisation projects and our scope 3 management strategies, see the 2023 IPL Climate Change Report.\n\nOur 2023 global energy use has decreased by 11% since 2022 due to scheduled maintenance shutdowns at our St Helens and Cheyenne plants in the US, and the cessation of natural gas based manufacturing at our Gibson Island site in Australia during the year. Our scope 1 GHG emissions also decreased by 11%. Our purchased electricity and scope 2 GHG emissions decreased by 20% and 28% respectively. Our scope 3 value chain emissions decreased by 11%. This data is shown graphically to the right.\n\nOur GHG intensity per tonne of ammonia decreased by 3% on last year, which is an 11% reduction against our 2015 intensity baseline.

In addition to IPL's comprehensive annual risk management process and climate scenarios, the World Resources Institute (WRI) Water Tool is completed each year for long term projections and reviewed by IPL's Chief Risk O/fficer.\n\nOur 2023 total global water withdrawal decreased by 8% on 2022, to 44,629 megalitres (ML). We discharged 26,813 ML to sewers and the environment, with 95.2% of this discharge being clean cooling water returned under EPA licence to the US rivers from which it was taken. This brings our net water use to 17,816 ML in 2023, which is 5% less than our 2022 water use.

This has reduced GHG emissions by ~400,000 tCO2e each year for the past 10 years.\n\nIn 2022, IPL approved the installation of tertiary N2O abatement, which will provide even greater reductions. A further ~200,000 tCO2e will be abated annually, which equates to a 7% reduction against IPL's 2020 baseline (5) . During 2023, work progressed to support the aim of installation being completed in 2024. This project will underpin the achievement of IPL's 5% by 2025 reduction target.\n\n## LOMO Tertiary N2O Abatement\n\nDyno Nobel's Louisiana, Missouri (LOMO) AN manufacturing facility is the company's only nitric acid plant without some form of abatement already installed. For this reason, abatement of N2O at LOMO has been under investigation for some time. In 2021, we installed Continuous Process Emissions Monitoring (CPEM) technology at the plant to improve measurement and allow a more accurate 2020 baseline to be established. During 2022-23, stack testing con/firmed that the measurement is now fully calibrated and resulted in a restatement of our 2020, 2021 and 2022 GHG emissions from this source (4) .\n\nThis project passed through Front End Loading (FEL) stage in 2023 with $2.8m invested. It was approved by the Board in August 2023 with installation targeted for 2025. Once installed, ~500,000 tCO2e will be abated annually at LOMO. This will equate to a 19% reduction against IPL's 2020 baseline (5) .\n\n## Gibson Island Green Ammonia\n\nThe Gibson Island Green Ammonia project is a partnership between IPL and Fortescue Future Industries (FFI) to investigate green ammonia production at Gibson Island. The site has used natural gas to produce hydrogen (H2) for the manufacture of ammonia (NH3) since it was built in 1969 (obtaining the nitrogen (N) required from the air). The current model under consideration would involve FFI constructing an on-site water electrolysis\n\nplant to produce hydrogen from the electrolysis of water (H2O) using renewable electricity, thereby dramatically reducing GHG emissions. FFI would develop and operate the hydrogen manufacturing facility, with IPL operating the ammonia manufacturing facility.\n\nWe are excited to report that the project completed FEED (8) stage in 2023 and a /final investment decision is expected before the end of the 2023 calendar year. Should it proceed, it would be Australia's /first industrial scale green ammonia production facility, demonstrating existing infrastructure can be retro/fitted to utilise zero-emissions energy sources. If adopted, the new water electrolysis facility would produce up to 70,000 tonnes of renewable hydrogen per year and replace all of Gibson Island's current gas feedstock and 99% of its natural gas energy use. This would result in a 17% reduction against IPL's 2020 baseline (5) .\n\n## Investigating science based and scope 3 targets\n\nDuring 2023, we continued to work across our business units to develop management strategies and identify key enablers to reduce scope 3. These are presented for each of our businesses in Chapter 3 of the 2023 IPL Climate Change Report, which is available on our website. We now have scope 3 GHG sources fully mapped throughout our value chains, and aim to have systems in place to track and manage scope 3, just as e/ffectively as we track and manage other supplier information, by 2025. We will continue to Investigate Science Based Targets with the release of the SBTi methodology for the Chemicals sector in 2024.\n\n## Sale of the Waggaman ammonia plant\n\nDuring 2023, the FEED (8) study was completed for the proposed Carbon Capture Facility (CCF) at our Waggaman Louisiana (WALA) ammonia manufacturing facility. The CCF is designed to capture the pure stream of CO2 created during the ammonia manufacturing process before transport via pipeline to a permanent geological sequestration site. Following Memorandums of Understanding (MOU's) established in 2022 with several shortlisted parties to work through the options for transport and deep well injection of the CO2, recommendation for selection of a /final partner was made in 2023. This partner is currently working through the approval process for the Class VI injection well operation.\n\nThis CCS project would reduce CO2 emissions from the plant by ~800,000 tCO2 per annum and the targeted commissioning date of the CCF facility is currently 2026. IPL reached an agreement for the sale of WALA to CF Industries Holdings, Inc. (CF) in March 2023 (9) . In its announcement of this agreement, CF Industries states that its mission is to provide clean energy to feed and fuel the world sustainably, and that it anticipates implementing CCS at the site on an accelerated timeline (10) . For this reason, WALA's emissions and the expected GHG reduction associated with this project have been removed from IPL's baseline and targets respectively.",

Our dedicated site-based teams engage with local community members, business representatives, charities, governments, indigenous suppliers, and community organisations - to ensure that decisions are made locally and at site level, where community needs are best understood.\n\nGuiding our approach to community engagement, social investment, cultural heritage and working with Indigenous communities is our Sustainable Communities Policy, which outlines our commitment to:\n\n- \u00bb listen to and work with the community;\n- \u00bb strive to be a valued corporate citizen; and\n- \u00bb respect our neighbours, their values and cultural heritage, and be considerate of them in carrying out our operations.\n\n## Keeping our communities safe\n\nThe safety of our people and the communities in which we operate must always come /first, which is why IPL has robust safety measures in place to monitor, manage, and prevent any potential risk or impact to our workforce and the local communities in which we operate.\n\nDue to the potentially hazardous nature of industrial and agricultural chemicals, IPL's on-site sta/ff are well trained to cooperate and engage with local community leaders and /first responders on how to keep the community safe in the unlikely event of an incident.\n\n## Our principles for giving\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nLocal Sites\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nLocal\n\nInitiatives\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nHealthCommunity Development\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur areas of focusEducation\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn addition to our robust safety measures, many of our sites are required by law to communicate regularly with our communities regarding safety plans and emergency procedures. In the Americas, 74 per cent of our sites fall into this category. These sites regularly engage with communities and /first responders to share community safety plans and emergency procedures in the event of a potential incident. In the Asia Paci/fic region, 23 per cent of sites also fall into this category. Some of these sites are classi/fied as Major Hazard Facilities and these follow Safe Work Australia guidelines in communicating with their communities.\n\n## Giving back\n\nIPL has two key Corporate Giving programs that help bring our Community Investment Framework to life. The /first is our Dollar-for-Dollar program. It matches employee donations and site-based fundraising e/fforts (up to $25,000 annually) where they align with our Principles for Giving.\n\nThe second is our Workplace Giving program. This is a voluntary workplace giving scheme for Australian employees whereby they can donate to one or more of the company's nominated not-for-pro/fit charities with the assurance that IPL will match these donations up to a total of $25,000 each year.\n\nDuring 2023, $928,315 of community investment was made globally through IPL's Corporate Giving programs and many site-based initiatives, including in-kind donations and employee volunteer hours. All donations were made in line with our Principles for Giving, with 11% allocated to improving education, 30% contributing towards health and sport initiatives, and 59% to local community development, including emergency and disaster relief.\n\n## IPL Community Investment Framework\n\nOur framework preferences local approaches, enabling each IPL business and site to respond to the distinct needs of their communities.\n\nEducation: Childhood, adult and Indigenous speci/fic education activities.\n\nHealth: Activities and organisations working towards better physical and mental health.\n\nCommunity Development: Enrich community life and enhance the environmental, social & economic sustainability of local communities.\n\nIPL Values: Initiatives that align to our values & business strategy and are integral to the sustainability of our communities.\n\nLocal Initiatives: Helping local organisations develop skills & resources to bring positive and lasting bene/fits to communities.\n\nLocal Sites: Solutions to local challenges & opportunities in the communities where our people work and live.",

The record date for entitlement to this dividend is 5 December 2023. The total dividend payment will be $97.1m.\n\nOther than the matters reported on above, the directors have not become aware of any other signi/ficant matter or circumstance that has arisen since the end of the /financial year, that has a/ffected or may a/ffect the operations of the Group, the results of those operations, or the state of a/ffairs of the Group in subsequent years, which has not been covered in this report.\n\n## Likely developments\n\nThe OFR contains information on the Company's 2023 /financial performance and prospects for future /financial years, and refers to likely developments in the Company's operations and the expected results of these operations in future /financial years. Information on likely developments in the Company's operations for future /financial years and the expected results of those operations together with details that could give rise to material detriment to the Company (for example, information that is commercially sensitive, con/fidential or could give a third party a commercial advantage) have not been included in this report where the directors believe it would likely result in unreasonable prejudice to the Company.\n\n## Environmental regulation and performance\n\nThe operations of the Group are subject to environmental regulation under the jurisdiction of the countries in which those operations are conducted including Australia, US, Mexico, Chile, Canada, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, Turkey and France. The Group is committed to complying with environmental legislation, regulations, standards and licences relevant to its operations.\n\nThe environmental laws and regulations generally address certain aspects and potential impacts of the Group's activities in relation to, among other things, air and noise quality, soil, water, biodiversity and wildlife. The Group operates under a Global Health, Safety and Environment Management System which sets out guidelines on the Group's approach to environmental management, including a requirement for sites to undertake environmental risk assessments identifying controls for our signi/ficant risks and improvements plans.\n\nIn certain jurisdictions, the Group holds licences for some of its operations and activities from the relevant environmental regulator. The Group Environmental Licence Compliance Procedure requires sites with permits or licences to set up actions to maintain compliance, the completion of which are tracked monthly at Business Unit and Group levels. The Group also reports statutory non-compliances as required.\n\nMeasurement of the Group's environmental performance, including determination of areas of focus and assessment of projects to be undertaken, is based not only on the actual impact of incidents, but also upon the potential consequence, consistent with IPL's risk-based focus.\n\nDuring the year, the Group has continued to focus on licence compliance and identi/fication and mitigation of environmental risks. Remediation works have progressed at a number of sites in Australia and the US.\n\nEnvironmental performance has maintained last year's improvement with zero Signi/ficant Environmental Incidents reported in the 2023 /financial year. Improved performance was evident in lower consequence environmental events, in particular those categorised as actual consequence 4. This is predominantly due to site management's focus on environmental incidents as well as Gibson Island management's ongoing engagement with the regulator, improved management of potentially contaminated stormwater and operating in compliance with three Environmental Protection Orders during FY23.\n\nIn Australia, two incidents at Phosphate Hill (one in 2022 and one in 2023) led to two Penalty Infringement Notices (PIN) being issued by the Queensland Department of Environment and Science (DES) during the 2023 /financial year, amounting to a total of AU$28,750. These incidents involved losses of containment from pipe networks to ground or to surface water.",

        "page_content": "These incidents are repeat incidents of a similar nature and as a result several additional corrective actions have been implemented, including increased frequency of decant water network inspections, improved quality of permit to work activities and face to face environmental compliance training for team leaders.\n\nAt Gibson Island, the obligations and associated milestones under the two Environmental Protection Orders (EPOs) issued in 2021 relating to stormwater release quality and groundwater contamination were consistently met during the year and have both been completed. A new EPO was issued in June 2023 covering both groundwater and surface water actions up to mid2024. This order enforces commitments made by the operations to carry out further environmental studies, improve infrastructure, systems and materials handling to signi/ficantly reduce the risk of unacceptable releases to the environment.To avoid further regulatory action by the DES, Gibson Island management has entered into an Enforceable Undertaking (EU) arrangement with the Department. The commitments made under the EU include improvement actions identi/fied in the current EPO as well as broader community focused funding (A$180,000) of university research and local catchment management activities.\n\nIn the US, implementation of the regulatory commitments associated with the US Consent Decree in force at St Helens (Oregon) has been completed with the USEPA granting a termination of the Consent Decree in April 2023. The Consent Decree related to Carthage and Louisiana (Missouri) continued in line with the required milestone timings. The remaining tasks for Louisiana have been completed and one remaining requirement is in progress for Carthage. Once this remaining requirement has been met (expected during FY24), compliance with existing permits and regulations takes e/ffect and continues for 3 years before a request for termination of the Consent Decree can be submitted.\n\nFollowing a 2019 Notice of Potential Violation from the USEPA for our Cheyenne facility, agreement was reached in FY23 on breaches of the Clean Air Act (CAA) and the Emergency Planning and Community Right to Know Act (EPCRA). Under the CAA a /fine of US$394,906 and an Administrative Order on Consent (AOC) was agreed for process safety and mechanical integrity violations. The requirements of the AOC are expected to be completed by end December 2023 when the /fine becomes due. In addition, a /fine of US$20,352 was received for failing to provide a written follow up as required under the EPRCA after having provided immediate noti/fication of two ammonia releases in 2019.\n\nTwo other /fines were received in the US with a US$20,000 /fine from the Federal Railroad Administration for release of ammonium nitrate liquid during transportation (Cheyenne, Wyoming) and a US$4,788 /fine for the release of reverse osmosis water without a permit in place (Biwabik, Minnesota).\n\n## Indemnities and insurance\n\nThe Company's Constitution provides that, to the extent permitted by law, the Company must indemnify any person who is, or has been, a director or secretary of the Company against any liability incurred by that person including any liability incurred as an o/fficer of the Company or a subsidiary of the Company and legal costs incurred by that person in defending an action.\n\nThe Constitution further provides that the Company may enter into an agreement with any current or former director or secretary or a person who is, or has been, an o/fficer of the Company or a subsidiary of the Company to indemnify the person against such liabilities.\n\nIn accordance with the Company's Constitution, the Company has entered into Deeds of Access, Indemnity and Insurance with each director of the Company and certain o/fficer's and members of senior management. Pursuant to those deeds, the Company has paid a premium in respect of a contract insuring directors and o/fficers of the Group against any liability for costs and expenses incurred by them in defending civil or criminal proceedings involving them as such o/fficers, with some exceptions. The contract of insurance prohibits disclosure of the nature of the liability insured against and the amount of the premium paid.\n\n## Auditor independence and non-audit services\n\nDeloitte Touche Tohmatsu (Deloitte) was appointed as the Company's external auditor at the 2011 Annual General Meeting and continues in o/ffice in accordance with section 327B(2) of the Corporations Act 2001. Mr Tim Richards was appointed as the Company's lead audit partner commencing for the 2019 /financial year.\n\nIPL has worked with Deloitte to transition Mr Richards and on-board his successor, Ms Suzana Vlahovic, during the 2023 /financial year. Ms Vlahovic will be IPL's lead audit partner for the 2024 /financial year.\n\nThe Group may decide to engage the auditor, Deloitte, for the provision of non-audit services, where such services are not in con/flict with their role as auditor and their expertise and/or detailed experience with the Company may allow cost e/fficiencies for the work.\n\nThe Board has considered the position and, in accordance with advice received by the Audit and Risk Management Committee, is satis/fied that the provision of non-audit services during the year by Deloitte is compatible with the general standard of independence for auditors imposed by the Corporations Act 2001 and does not compromise the external auditor's independence.\n\nThe Board also notes:\n\n- \u00bb the engagements for all non-audit services provided by Deloitte were reviewed by the Interim Chief Financial O/fficer, and where relevant, approved by the Audit and Risk Management Committee, in accordance with the Committee's Charter and the Company's policy on the engagement of the external auditor for the provision of nonaudit services to ensure they do not impact the integrity and objectivity of the auditor; and\n- \u00bb the non-audit services provided by Deloitte did not undermine the general principles relating to auditor independence as set out in APES 110 Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants, as they did not involve reviewing or auditing the auditor's own work, acting in a management or decision making capacity for the Group, acting as an advocate for the Group or jointly sharing economic risks or rewards.\n\nDeloitte provided non-audit services to the amount of $186.2k during the year ended 30 September 2023 (refer to note 24 to the /financial statements).\n\nThe lead auditor has provided a written declaration that no professional engagement for the Group has been carried out during the year that would impair Deloitte's independence as auditor. A copy of the auditor's independence declaration is set out on page 83 and forms part of this report.",

        "page_content": "## Introduction from the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee\n\nDear Shareholders,\n\nOn behalf of IPL's Remuneration Committee and the Board, I am pleased to present the Remuneration Report for 2023 which sets out the remuneration information for the Executive Key Management Personnel (KMP) and the Non-executive Directors.\n\n## Our approach\n\nThe Remuneration Committee's objective is to ensure our remuneration framework provides a bridge between shareholder value and individual performance, whilst ensuring alignment with our other key stakeholders.\n\nWe ensure individual performance is measured using targets that align to IPL's values, long-term strategy and metrics, shorter term /financial targets and relevant individual goals.\n\n## Financial Year 2023 in review\n\nHealth, Safety & Environment (HSE) outcomes for the year were mixed. TRIFR (1) plateaued compared to the previous /financial year but the severity of injuries recorded decreased. There was a signi/ficant improvement in Process Safety with a 44% reduction of Tier 1 and Tier 2 incidents compared to FY22. We have been able to sustain our excellent environmental performance with Zero Signi/ficant Environmental Incidents. Zero Harm key activities were implemented aligned with pursuing year-on-year improvement in our Zero Harm Ambition.\n\nClimate change initiatives delivered strong results with signi/ficant progress made on the Gibson Island Green Ammonia Project, in partnership with Fortescue Future Industries (FFI), the tertiary nitrous oxide (N2O) abatement at the nitric acid plants at our Moranbah, Queensland and Louisiana, Missouri (LOMO) ammonium nitrate manufacturing facilities, and Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) at our Waggaman, Louisiana (WALA) ammonia plant.\n\nThe 2023 /financial year was characterised by a resilient earnings performance from the Dyno Nobel businesses and mixed manufacturing reliability. Overall Group /financial performance was impacted by unplanned plant outage and gas supply interruptions at Phosphate Hill and the impact of a lower commodity price cycle across the Fertilisers business.\n\n## Executive changes in FY23\n\nDuring /financial year 2023, Ms Jeanne Johns stepped down from the role of Managing Director & Chief Executive O/fficer (MD&CEO) and ceased to be KMP on 6 June 2023.\n\nWe thank Jeanne for her signi/ficant contribution to the Company. The Board is undertaking a comprehensive search process for a permanent MD&CEO.\n\nMr Paul Victor, Chief Financial O/fficer, was appointed as Interim CEO, e/ffective 6 June 2023. Paul received a higher duties allowance equivalent to 40% of his /fixed annual remuneration and an increase to his target STI opportunity (equivalent to 100% of his /fixed remuneration) on a pro-rated basis for the period he was Interim CEO during /financial year 2023.\n\n## Fixed remuneration in FY23\n\nThe former MD&CEO received a /fixed remuneration increase of 3.9% e/ffective 1 January 2023, the /first increase since January 2019 (refer section 2.2). No other Executive KMP received a /fixed remuneration increase during /financial year 2023.\n\n## Short-term incentive outcomes in FY23\n\nThe Interim CEO achieved an STI outcome of 41.8% of maximum and the average Executive KMP STI outcome was 35.8% of maximum.\n\nOverall STI outcomes re/flect target HSE performance, Headline Group NPAT at below threshold in /financial year 2023 and adjusted NPAT being achieved between threshold and target.\n\nStrong /financial performance in the DNAP business resulted in an Adjusted EBIT outcome of between target and stretch performance for the President, DNAP.  The DNA and IPF businesses did not reach threshold Adjusted EBIT levels.\n\nProgress on Climate Change (Sustainability) measures and positive performance against strategic initiatives including agreeing the proposed WALA sale resulted in outcomes ranging between target and stretch for these measures.\n\nSection 2.1 outlines additional information on the Company's /financial year 2023 performance and resulting STI outcomes are provided in section 2.3 of this report.\n\n## Long-term incentive\n\nThe three metrics for the LTI 2020/23 plan are Relative TSR, Return on Invested Capital and Long-Term Value Metrics. The non-TSR performance conditions are commented on in section 2.5 of this report. The Relative TSR will be tested following IPL's full year results in November 2023 and the /final vesting outcome will be commented on in the 2024 Remuneration Report. We anticipate an overall level of vesting between 65% to 88.5%.\n\nFor the LTI 2019/22 plan where the testing of performance period for the Relative TSR condition occurred in November 2022, 78.34% of performance rights vested (refer to section 2.4 of this report).\n\n## FY24 remuneration framework\n\nDuring /financial year 2023, the Board undertook a comprehensive review of the Executive Remuneration Framework. This review was undertaken to determine whether the existing framework remains appropriate to best support the execution of our strategies, to increase shareholder value, retain and motivate our key talent and ensure alignment with our other key stakeholders.\n\nWith key business transactions due for completion in /financial year 2024 and the anticipated appointment of a permanent MD&CEO to drive a transformation of future business performance, the Board determined that changes to the existing remuneration framework to support this business transformation will be aligned to the appointment of a new MD&CEO. The Board will consult with shareholders and details of the remuneration package for the new permanent MD&CEO will be provided at the relevant time.\n\nThe Board has determined to provide a /fixed remuneration increase in FY24 to existing KMPs of 3.2% together with making changes to the /financial year 2024 STI program. These changes include reducing the number of scorecard measures within the STI scorecard and increasing the weighting to adjusted /financial performance measures which are better controlled by each KMP. In addition, a moderator will also be applied to the Strategic Objectives component of the STI which can vary the overall outcome for Strategic Objectives based on each KMP's performance in leading a safe, inclusive and high performing team. Further detail on these changes are outlined in section 5 of this report.\n\nWe look forward to ongoing dialogue with, and the support of our shareholders, and welcome your feedback and comments on any aspect of this Report.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGreg Robinson Chairman",

For the 2023 /financial year, Group NPAT (before IMIs and excluding non-controlling interests) decreased by 43.3% to $582m re/flecting the downturn in commodity prices.

The primary benchmarking was undertaken based on IPL's market capitalisation of $7.7 billion at 31 March 2022, which covered all ASX companies with market capitalisation of $3.85 billion to $14 billion as at 31 March 2022.\n\nFor roles located outside Australia, market-speci/fic information sourced from US data providers Korn Ferry, Mercer and Equilar was used for benchmarking purposes.\n\nFollowing a salary review, the /fixed remuneration of the former MD&CEO, Ms Johns, was increased by 3.9% in January 2023, the /first increase since January 2019. No other KMP received a /fixed remuneration increase during /financial year 2023.\n\nMr Victor was appointed Interim CEO, e/ffective 6 June 2023. Mr Victor received a higher duties allowance equivalent to 40% of his /fixed annual remuneration ($360,000) on a pro-rated basis for the period he was Interim CEO during /financial year 2023.\n\n## Relationship between the Company's performance and Executive KMP LTI outcomes\n\nThe below graph shows the relationship between IPL's TSR percentile ranking relative to its S&P/ASX 100 peer group over the three years that each plan operated, and the overall LTI vesting percentage that occurred for each plan. The LTI 2019/22 that vested in the 2023 /financial year delivered 78.34% of total opportunity available for that plan. The LTI 2020/23 outcomes will be outlined in next year's report (refer to footnote (2) under Table 2 above).\n\n## ASX 100 Percentile TSR Ranking and LTI Vesting %",

The measures outlined in the table re/flect the objectives set for Mr Victor in his role as CFO. Following his appointment as Interim CEO, in assessing Mr Victor's overall STI outcome the Board took into consideration his performance against these objectives and also his contribution to the STI objectives set for the former MD&CEO. On appointment as Interim CEO on 6 June 2023, Mr Victor's target STI opportunity was increased to 100% of his /fixed remuneration (including the higher duties allowance) and maximum STI opportunity to 150% of his /fixed remuneration (including the higher duties allowance) until the end of /financial year 2023. The overall STI outcome for Mr Victor re/flects his STI opportunities as both CFO and Interim CEO calculated on a pro-rated basis.

The performance period for the Absolute ROIC and LongTerm Value Metrics conditions of the LTI 2019/22 ended on 30 September 2022. The performance period for the Relative TSR Condition ended /five days following the Company's full year results in November 2022. In the 2022 Remuneration Report, the Relative TSR component of the LTI 2019/22 was not known at the time and we expected vesting to be around 60% to 80%. Following testing against all performance conditions, the Board determined that 78.34% of the performance rights granted under the plan vested (with the remaining 21.66% lapsing). This is in line with the estimated vesting outlined to shareholders in the 2022 Remuneration Report. Details in relation to each of the performance conditions are set out below.\n\n## Relative TSR Condition - 40% of award\n\nIn relation to the Relative TSR Condition, the Company's relative TSR performance over the period achieved 66.67% percentile performance of the comparator group of S&P/ASX 100 companies. Accordingly, 83.34% of the performance rights granted subject to the Relative TSR Condition vested.\n\n## Long-Term Value Metrics Condition - 30% of award\n\nIn relation to the Long-Term Value Metrics Condition, the Board assessed this component against a balanced scorecard and determined the outcome partially achieved the performance goals across the entirety of the scorecard. The Board determined that 50% of the performance rights granted subject to this condition vested. Commentary on the performance against the scorecard is set out in the following table.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|                                                   |                                                                                                                                                                    | Performance Outcome   | Performance Outcome   | Performance Outcome                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |    |\n|---------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----|\n| Long-Term Value  Metric Condition                 | Objectives                                                                                                                                                         | Threshold             | Target                | Commentary                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |    |\n| Manufacturing  Excellence                         | Improvement in the average  Reliability across IPL's key  manufacturing plants against the  historical baseline average (85%).                                     |                       |                       | Overall outcome of 87% was achieved.

Executive Remuneration and Governance\n\n## 3.1 Executive remuneration overview\n\nIn alignment with its remuneration strategy, the Board's policy on Executive remuneration is that it comprises both a /fixed annual remuneration component (FAR) and 'at risk' or performance-related components (short-term incentive (STI) and long-term incentive (LTI) where:\n\n- (I) the majority of Executive remuneration is 'at risk'; and\n- (II) the level of FAR for Executives is benchmarked against that paid for similar positions at the median of comparator groups of ASX companies.\n\n## Comparator groups\n\nS&P/ASX listed companies with market capitalisation between 50% and 200% of IPL market capitalisation (Primary Benchmark).\n\nS&P/ASX 100 listed companies.\n\nA select group of 20 S&P/ASX listed companies from the Industrials, Materials and Energy Sectors, selected on the basis of market capitalisation and related industry exposure, consisting of: Adelaide Brighton, AGL Energy, ALS, Ampol Australia, Atlas Arteria, Aurizon, BlueScope Steel, Boral, Brickworks, Cleanaway, CSR, Downer EDI, Fletcher Building, Orica, Origin Energy, Orora, Qube, Reliance Worldwide, Seven Group and Sims.\n\nFor roles located outside Australia, market-speci/fic data is used as an additional reference point for benchmarking purposes.\n\n## 3.2 Executive remuneration strategy\n\nIPL embraces a set of Strategic Value Drivers that underpin the Company's business and form the platform for the Company's future earnings growth and shareholder returns. The Company's commitment to addressing climate change challenges and looking for opportunities in the decarbonisation of the world's energy systems is an important constituent of the business strategy and integrated across all the Strategic Value Drivers:\n\nZero Harm - Broadening and setting year-on-year improvement objectives across key metrics including environmental care and process safety.\n\nTalented and Engaged People - One IPL collaborative culture with engaged, diverse and inclusive teams focused on customers and value creation.\n\nCustomer Focus - Partnering with our customers to create added value and practical solutions for today and the future.\n\nManufacturing Excellence - Driving consistently high performance across all of our assets and investigating ways to address our greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nLeading Technology Solutions - Innovation on the ground with practical innovations that our customers can use today to improve their operations and environmental outcomes.\n\nPro/fitable Growth - Focus on opportunities that are distinctive to our di/fferentiated technology, core markets, core capabilities and market segments.\n\nUnder the Strategic Value Driver of 'Talented and Engaged People', IPL recognises that, to generate competitive returns for its shareholders, it requires talented people who are capable, committed and motivated. IPL's remuneration strategy is designed to support the objectives of the business and to enable the Company to attract, retain and reward Executives of the requisite skill and calibre.\n\nThe key principles of the Company's remuneration strategy are to:\n\n- \u00bb reward executives for outcomes at both the Group and business unit level that create sustained value for shareholders;\n- \u00bb require behaviours aligned to Company values, culture and code of conduct;\n- \u00bb drive strong alignment with shareholder interests;\n- \u00bb majority of executive remuneration to be 'at risk' and subject to demanding /financial and non-/financial performance objectives;\n- \u00bb be globally competitive to attract and retain the talent;\n- \u00bb reward individual high performance and encourage a one team culture; and\n- \u00bb ensure the remuneration framework is equitable, transparent, simple to understand, communicate and implement.\n\n## 3.3 Executive remuneration governance\n\nThe remuneration of the Executives is set by the Board, having regard to recommendations from the Remuneration Committee.\n\nWhere appropriate, the Remuneration Committee of the Board engages external advisors to provide input into the process of reviewing Executive and Non-executive Director remuneration. For the 2023 /financial year, the Remuneration Committee received market and benchmarking data from various sources, but this information did not constitute a remuneration recommendation for the purposes of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth).\n\nFurther information in relation to the Board and the Remuneration Committee can be found in IPL's Corporate Governance Statement available on IPL's website.",

The FAR component is inclusive of cash and superannuation only, whilst 'at risk' compensation is based on maximum entitlement that could potentially be awarded under the STI and LTI plans.\n\nThe restricted shares component of the STI (50% for the MD&CEO, 25% for other Executive KMP) must be deferred until an Executive's MSR is attained.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 4.2 Fixed annual remuneration\n\nExecutives receive their /fixed annual remuneration (FAR) in a variety of forms, including cash, superannuation, and any applicable fringe bene/fits. The Executives' FAR is set by reference to appropriate benchmark information for each Executive's role, level of knowledge, skill, responsibilities and experience. The level of remuneration is reviewed annually in alignment with the /financial year and with reference to, among other things, Company and individual performance and market data provided by an appropriately quali/fied and independent external data specialist.\n\n## 4.3 Short-term incentive\n\nThe STI is an annual 'at risk' incentive which is dependent on the achievement of particular performance measures.

        "page_content": "## 4.5 LTI performance conditions\n\nDetails of the performance conditions for the LTI 2022/25 are set out below.\n\n## Relative TSR Condition (40%)\n\nThe Relative TSR Condition requires growth in the Company's TSR to be at or above the median of the companies in the comparator group, being the S&P/ASX 100. This condition provides shareholder alignment as it takes into account the Company's share price movement as well as dividends paid, relative to other organisations comparable to the Company.\n\nThe S&P/ASX 100 has been chosen as the comparator group because, having regard to the business segments in which the Company operates and, speci/fically, the absence of a su/fficient number of direct comparator companies, the Board considers the S&P/ASX 100 to represent the most appropriate, and objective, comparator group. It also represents the group of companies against which the Company competes for shareholder capital. The Board has the discretion to vary the comparator group at any time, including to remove companies from, or include companies in, the comparator group.\n\nThe table below sets out the TSR Condition, and the percentage of the performance rights that will vest based on satisfaction of this condition.\n\n| Relative TSR ranking of IPL                                      | % of performance rights subject to the TSR Condition that will vest   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Less than 50th percentile                                        | Nil                                                                   |\n| At or greater than 50th percentile but less than 75th percentile | Pro rata from 50% on a straight-line basis                            |\n| At 75th percentile or greater                                    | 100%                                                                  |\n\n## Long-Term Value Metrics Condition (15%)\n\nThe Long-Term Value Metrics Condition relates to the delivery of signi/ficant aspects of the Board approved strategy. The Long-Term Value Metrics Condition comprises components aligned with the Company's strategic drivers: Leading Technology Solutions; and Pro/fitable Growth. Both of these strategic drivers has a direct impact on /financial outcomes.\n\nThe table below summarises the Long-Term Value Metrics components for the LTI 2022/25:\n\n|                                    |                                                                                                                  |                                                                            | Scorecard                                                             |\n|------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Long Term Value Metrics  Condition | Rationale                                                                                                        | Measurement criteria                                                       | Performance goals                                                     |\n| Leading Technology  Solutions      | By focusing on di/fferentiated products  and services and innovations to meet  the challenges of customers, this |                                                                            | Margin from technologies.

Some of the performance goals involve commercial-in-con/fidence quantitative targets and, as such, some detailed performance goals are not disclosed, but performance against the goals is disclosed at the end of the performance period. For the LTI 2019/22, these details are set out in section 2.4. For the LTI 2020/23, these details are set out in section 2.5. For the LTI 2022/25, the relevant details will be set out in the 2026 Remuneration Report.\n\nThe Board will determine the outcome for the relevant component of the Long-Term Value Metrics Condition under each LTI plan having regard to the results achieved against the performance goals across the entirety of the Scorecard for that component. If the Board determines that all of the performance goals in respect of a component of the Long-Term Value Metrics Condition have been achieved, all of the performance rights subject to that component will vest.\n\nIf not all performance goals in respect of a component of the Long-Term Value Metrics Condition are met over the performance period, the extent to which that component of the Long-Term Value Metrics Condition has been satis/fied (if at all) will be determined by the Board. In doing so, the Board will have regard to the results achieved against the performance goals across all of the components of the relevant Scorecard, without applying a speci/fic weighting to any particular performance goal.\n\n## Average ROIC Condition (35%)\n\nThe Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) condition for LTI 2022/25 has been updated from being calculated via a point-to-point methodology, to being calculated via a three-year average over the performance period. This adjustment will accomodate intra-year movements in ROIC aligned with the impacts of commodity price volatility.\n\nROIC has been selected as it is a key determinant of e/fficient use of the capital entrusted to management by shareholders. It also re/flects all of the levers to create shareholder value, including operational e/fficiency, capital e/fficiency, asset utilisation and pro/fitability. ROIC is de/fined as Net Pro/fit After Tax, excluding interest and individually material items, divided by total invested capital (on a rolling 13 month average basis).",

The targets have also been determined in the context of the goodwill recognised on the Company's balance sheet for the acquisition of Dyno Nobel in 2008.\n\n## Sustainability Condition (10%)\n\nThe Sustainability Condition will measure the Company's organisational performance against the Climate Change Management strategy, progress towards IPL's 2030 absolute GHG reduction targets, and its development of a scope 3 GHG emissions reduction strategy. Key successes during this 3-year period will be driven by demonstrating material progress on implementation of the Moranbah N2O tertiary abatement project, the Waggaman Carbon Capture and Sequestration (CCS) MoU/project, the Louisiana, Missouri N2O abatement project, and Gibson Island Green Ammonia Project in partnership with Fortescue Future Industries (FFI). The Board has the discretion to determine the vesting outcome between 0% and 100% for this Condition as it considers appropriate.\n\n## 4.6 Executive service agreement terms\n\nRemuneration and other terms of employment for the Executives are formalised in service agreements. Most Executives are engaged on similar contractual terms, with minor variations to re/flect di/ffering circumstances. Each agreement is unlimited in term; however, each agreement provides that the Company may terminate an Executive's employment immediately for cause without any separation payment, save for accrued amounts such as leave, or otherwise without cause, with or without notice, in which case the Company must pay a separation payment plus accrued amounts such as leave.\n\nThe notice period to be provided by the Executives is set out in the table below:\n\n| Current Executives   | Notice period to be   provided by the Executive   | Notice period to be   provided by the Company   |\n|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|\n| P Victor             | 26 weeks                                          | 26 weeks                                        |\n| G Hayne (1)          | 26 weeks                                          | 52 weeks                                        |\n| B Lusk               | 26 weeks                                          | 26 weeks                                        |\n| Former Executives    | Notice period   provided by the Executive         | Notice period   provided by the Company         |\n| J Johns (2)          | 52 weeks                                          | 52 weeks                                        |",

Where applicable, comparative disclosures have been reclassi/fied for consistency with the current period if material.\n\nAs a result of the Waggaman sale agreement, the assets and liabilities directly attributable to Waggaman have been reclassi/fied to held-for-sale and the earnings presented as attributable to discontinued operations. Refer to note 14 of the /financial statements for the earnings, cash /flow and statement of /financial position of the Waggaman operations. Where applicable, comparative disclosures have been reclassi/fied for consistency with the current period.\n\nThe consolidated /financial statements were authorised for issue by the directors on 13 November 2023.\n\n## Subsidiaries\n\nSubsidiaries are entities that are controlled by the Group. The /financial results and /financial position of the subsidiaries are included in the consolidated /financial statements from the date control commences until the date control ceases.\n\nA list of the Group's subsidiaries is included in note 16.\n\n## Joint arrangements and associates\n\nA joint venture is an arrangement where the parties have rights to the net assets of the venture.\n\nA joint operation is an arrangement where the parties each have rights to the assets and liabilities relating to the arrangement.\n\nAssociates are those entities in respect of which the Group has signi/ficant in/fluence, but not control, over the /financial and operating policies of the entities.\n\nInvestments in joint ventures and associates are accounted for using the equity method. They are initially recognised at cost, and subsequent to initial recognition, the consolidated /financial statements include the Group's share of the pro/fit or loss and other comprehensive income of the investees.\n\nThe interests in joint operations are brought to account recognising the Group's share of jointly controlled assets; liabilities; expenses; and income from the joint operation.\n\nA list of the Group's joint arrangements and associates is included in note 16.\n\n## Statement of compliance\n\nThe consolidated /financial statements are general purpose /financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards (including Australian Interpretations) and the Corporations Act 2001. The consolidated /financial statements of the Group comply with International Financial Reporting Standards ( IFRS ) and interpretations. The Company is a for-pro/fit entity.\n\n## Key estimates and judgments\n\nKey accounting estimates and judgments are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectation of future events that may have a /financial impact on the Group and that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.\n\nThe resulting accounting estimates will, by de/finition, seldom equal the subsequent related actual result. The estimates and judgments that have a signi/ficant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of the assets and liabilities within the next /financial year are set out in the notes.\n\n## Rounding of amounts\n\nThe Company is of a kind referred to in ASIC Legislative Instrument, ASIC Corporations (Rounding in Financial/ Directors' Reports) Instrument 2016/191 , issued by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission dated 24 March 2016 and, in accordance with that Legislative Instrument, the amounts shown in this report and in the /financial statements have been rounded, except where otherwise stated, to the nearest one hundred thousand dollars.\n\n## Structural Separation\n\nOn 12 July 2023, IPL con/firmed that it had received a number of approaches for the potential acquisition of its Fertilisers business. Discussions are progressing.\n\nIPL will keep the market informed of any material developments as, and when, required.\n\nThere has been no impact on the /financial statements for FY23 other than the costs incurred to date which have been classi/fied as an individually material item and disclosed in the notes to the /financial statements.\n\n## Accounting standards issued\n\nThe Group adopted any amendments to Standards and Interpretations issued by the Australian Accounting Standards Board ( AASB ) that are relevant to its operations and e/ffective for the current year. The adoption of these revised Standards and Interpretations did not have a material impact on the Group's result.\n\nCertain new accounting Standards and Interpretations have been issued that are not mandatory for the 30 September 2023 reporting period and have not been early adopted by the Group. These Standards and Interpretations are not expected to have a material impact on the Group in the current or future reporting periods or on foreseeable future transactions.",

of the consideration received or receivable by the Group. Amounts disclosed as revenue are net of returns, trade allowances and amounts collected on behalf of third parties. Revenue is recognised for the major business activities on the following basis:\n\n- \u00bb Sale of goods and services: revenue from the sale of goods and services is recognised at the point in time when the performance obligations under the customer contract are satis/fied. This is typically when control of goods or services is transferred to the customer. The fee for the service component is recognised separately from the sale of goods.\n- \u00bb Interest income is recognised as it accrues using the e/ffective interest method.\n\nThe Group disaggregates its revenue per reportable segment as presented in note 1, as the revenue within each business unit is a/ffected by economic factors in a similar manner.\n\n## Goods and services tax\n\nRevenues, expenses, assets and liabilities (other than receivables and payables) are recognised net of the amount of goods and services tax ( GST ). The only exception is where the amount of GST incurred is not recoverable from the relevant taxation authorities. In these circumstances, the GST is recognised as part of the cost of the asset or as part of the item of expenditure.\n\n## Other income\n\nOther income represents gains that are not revenue. This includes royalty income and management fees from the Group's joint ventures and associates, income from contractual arrangements that are not considered external sales and government grants. IPL received Government grants during the year of $6.2m (2022: $48.0m) to fund the increased production of AdBlue at the Gibson Island facility given the shortage in the domestic market. Grant income is recognised as a deduction from the related expense with any excess income reported as other income. Government grants received in advance are recognised in the statement of /financial position as deferred income and released to the pro/fit and loss once the related expense is incurred.",

Tax expense is recognised in the pro/fit or loss, unless it relates to items that have been recognised in equity (as part of other comprehensive income). In this instance, the related tax expense is also recognised in equity.\n\n## Current tax\n\nCurrent tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year. It is calculated using tax rates applicable at the reporting date, and any adjustments to tax payable in respect of previous years.\n\nAs at 30 September 2023, the Group is in a current tax asset position which represents expected refunds in relation to current and prior year tax returns.\n\n## Deferred tax\n\nDeferred tax is recognised for all taxable temporary di/fferences and is calculated based on the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for /financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on the laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date.\n\nDeferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable pro/fits will be available against which the assets can be utilised. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax bene/fits will be realised.\n\nThe Group has and will continue to apply the temporary exception in AASB 112 Income Taxes not to recognise or disclose information about deferred tax assets and liabilities that could arise from OECD Pillar Two model rules.\n\n## O/ffsetting tax balances\n\nTax assets and liabilities are o/ffset when the Group has a legal right to o/ffset and intends either to settle on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.\n\n## Tax consolidation\n\nFor details on the Company's tax consolidated group refer to note 23.\n\n## Key estimates and judgments\n\n## Uncertain tax matters\n\nThe Group is subject to income taxes in Australia and foreign jurisdictions and as a result, the calculation of the Group's tax charge involves a degree of estimation and judgment in respect of certain items. In addition, there are transactions and calculations relating to the ordinary course of business for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. The Group recognises liabilities for potential tax audit issues in deferred tax liabilities based on management's assessment of whether additional taxes may be payable and calculates the provision in accordance with the applicable accounting standards including IFRIC 23 Uncertainty over income tax treatments. Where the /final tax outcome of these matters is di/fferent from the amounts that were initially recorded, these di/fferences impact the current and deferred tax provisions in the period in which such determination is made.",

The cost of manufactured goods is based on a weighted average costing method. For third party sourced goods, cost is net cost into warehouse.\n\n## Trade and other receivables\n\nTrade and other receivables are initially recognised at fair value plus any directly attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial measurement they are measured at amortised cost less any provisions for expected impairment losses or actual impairment losses. Credit losses and recoveries of items previously written o/ff are recognised in the pro/fit or loss.\n\nWhere substantially all risks and rewards relating to a receivable are transferred to a third party, the receivable is derecognised.\n\nTo manage cash in/flows which are impacted by seasonality and demand and supply variability, the Group has a nonrecourse receivable purchasing agreement to sell certain receivables to an unrelated entity in exchange for cash. As at 30 September 2023, receivables totalling $117.9m (2022: $94.9m) had been sold under this arrangement. The receivables were derecognised upon sale as substantially all risks and rewards associated with the receivables passed to the purchaser.\n\n## Trade and other payables\n\nTrade and other payables are stated at cost and represent liabilities for goods and services provided to the Group prior to the end of /financial year, which are unpaid at the reporting date.\n\nTo manage the cash /flow conversion cycle on some products procured by the Group, and to ensure that suppliers receive payment in a time period that suits their business model, the Group o/ffers some suppliers the opportunity to use supply chain /financing. At 30 September 2023, the balance of the supply chain /finance program was $148.3m (2022: $173.1m). The Group evaluates supplier arrangements against a number of indicators to assess if the payable continues to have the characteristics of a trade payable or should be classi/fied as borrowings. These indicators include whether the payment terms exceed customary payment terms in the industry. At 30 September 2023, the Group has assessed that on balance the payables subject to supplier /financing arrangements did not meet all of the characteristics to be classi/fied as borrowings and accordingly the balances remained in trade and other payables.",

In establishing the expected impairment loss provision, the Group also assessed the impact of the global economic challenges and its potential to a/ffect customers' repayment ability. Subsequent changes in economic and market conditions may result in the provision for impairment losses increasing or decreasing in future periods.\n\n## 5.

Capital management\n\nCapital is de/fined as the amount subscribed by shareholders to the Company's ordinary shares and amounts advanced by debt providers to any Group entity. The Group's objectives when managing capital are to safeguard its ability to continue as a going concern and invest in business growth, while providing returns to shareholders and bene/fits to other stakeholders.\n\nThe Group's key strategies for maintenance of an optimal capital structure include:\n\n- \u00bb Aiming to maintain an investment grade credit pro/file and the requisite /financial metrics.\n- \u00bb Securing access to diversi/fied sources of debt funding with a spread of maturity dates and su/fficient undrawn committed facility capacity.\n- \u00bb Optimising over the long term, to the extent practicable, the Group's Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC), while maintaining /financial /flexibility.\n\nIn order to optimise its capital structure, the Group may undertake one or a combination of the following actions:\n\n- \u00bb change the amount of dividends paid to shareholders and/or o/ffer a dividend reinvestment plan with or without a discount and/or with or without an underwriting facility when appropriate;\n- \u00bb return capital or issue new shares to shareholders;\n- \u00bb vary discretionary capital expenditure;\n- \u00bb raise new debt funding or repay existing debt balances; and\n- \u00bb draw down additional debt or sell non-core assets to reduce debt.\n\n## Key /financial metrics\n\nThe Group uses a range of /financial metrics to monitor the e/fficiency of its capital structure, including EBITDA interest cover and Net debt/ EBITDA before individually material items. Financial metric targets are maintained inside debt covenant restrictions. At 30 September the Group's position in relation to these metrics was:\n\n|                              | Target range           |   2023 |   2022 |\n|------------------------------|------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Net debt/EBITDA (times)  (1) | equal or less than 1.5 |    1.2 |    0.5 |\n| Interest cover (times)       | equal or more than 6.0 |    9.9 |   20.3 |\n\nThese ratios are impacted by a number of factors, including the level of cash retained from operating cash /flows generated by the Group after paying all of its commitments (including dividends or other returns of capital), movements in foreign exchange rates, changes to market interest rates and the fair value of hedges economically hedging the Group's net debt.\n\n## Self-insurance\n\nThe Group also self-insures for certain insurance risks under the Singapore Insurance Act. Under this Act, authorised general insurer, Coltivi Insurance Pte Limited (the Group's self-insurance company), is required to maintain a minimum amount of capital. For the /financial year ended 30 September 2023, Coltivi Insurance Pte Limited maintained capital in excess of the minimum requirements prescribed under this Act.\n\n## Issued capital\n\n## Ordinary shares\n\nOrdinary shares issued are classi/fied as equity and are fully paid, have no par value and carry one vote per share and the right to dividends. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares are recognised as a deduction from equity, net of any related income tax bene/fit.\n\nIssued capital as at 30 September 2023 amounted to $3,806.2m (1,942,225,029 ordinary shares).",

Subsequent to initial recognition, interest bearing liabilities are measured at amortised cost using the e/ffective interest method, with any di/fference between cost and redemption value recognised in the pro/fit or loss over the period of the borrowings.\n\nThe Group derecognises interest bearing liabilities when its obligation is discharged, cancelled or expires. Any gains and losses arising on derecognition are recognised in the pro/fit or loss.\n\nInterest bearing liabilities are classi/fied as current liabilities, except for those liabilities where the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement for at least 12 months after the year end, which are classi/fied as non-current.\n\n## Cash and cash equivalents\n\nCash includes cash at bank, cash on hand and short term investments, net of bank overdrafts.\n\n## Borrowing costs\n\nBorrowing costs include interest on borrowings and the amortisation of premiums relating to borrowings.\n\nBorrowing costs are expensed as incurred, unless they relate to qualifying assets (refer note 9). In this instance, the borrowing costs are capitalised and depreciated over the asset's expected useful life.",

Subsequent costs are included in the asset's carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, only when it is probable that future economic bene/fits associated with the item will /flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably.\n\nBorrowing costs in relation to the funding of qualifying assets are capitalised and included in the cost of the asset. Qualifying assets are assets that take more than 12 months to get ready for their intended use or sale. Where funds are borrowed, generally a weighted average interest rate is used for the capitalisation of interest.\n\nProperty, plant and equipment is subject to impairment testing. For details of impairment of assets, refer note 12.\n\n## Depreciation\n\nProperty, plant and equipment, other than freehold land, is depreciated on a straight-line basis. Freehold land is not depreciated. Depreciation rates are calculated to spread the cost of the asset (less any residual value), over its estimated useful life. Residual value is the estimated value of the asset at the end of its useful life.\n\nEstimated useful lives for each class of asset are as follows:\n\n- \u00bb Buildings and improvements\n\n20 - 50 years\n\n- \u00bb Machinery, plant and equipment 3 - 50 years\n\nResidual values and useful lives are reviewed and adjusted where relevant when changes in circumstances impact the use of the asset.",

Short term (12 months or less) and low value leases are recognised in the pro/fit or loss as a lease expense.\n\nRight-of-use assets are measured at cost, less any accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, and adjusted for any remeasurement of lease liabilities. The cost of right-of-use assets includes the amount of lease liabilities recognised, initial direct costs incurred, and lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentive received. Right-ofuse assets are depreciated on a straight line basis in the pro/fit or loss over the lease term.\n\nLease liabilities are recognised by the Group at the commencement date of the lease and are measured at the present value of lease payments to be made over the lease term. Lease payments include /fixed payments and variable lease payments that depend on an index or rate.\n\n## Key estimates and judgments\n\nExtension options - The Group considers whether an option to extend a lease is reasonably certain on a lease-by-lease basis, which considers the importance of the lease to the Group's operations and its economic incentive to extend the lease. The lease term is reassessed upon the occurrence of a signi/ficant event or change in circumstance.\n\nIncremental borrowing rate - To calculate the present value of lease payments, the Group uses an incremental borrowing rate at the commencement date of the lease. The incremental borrowing rate re/flects the duration and the /financing characteristics of the lease. Where the interest rate implicit in the lease is not readily available, the Group uses its incremental borrowing rate applicable to a portfolio of leases with reasonably similar characteristics.",

Goodwill is tested for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that it might be impaired.\n\n## Brand names\n\nBrand names acquired by the Group have inde/finite useful lives and are measured at cost less accumulated impairment. They are tested annually for impairment, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that they might be impaired.\n\n## Other intangible assets\n\nOther intangible assets acquired by the Group have /finite lives. They are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.\n\n## Subsequent expenditure\n\nSubsequent expenditure on intangible assets is capitalised only when it increases the future economic bene/fits of the asset to which it relates. All other such expenditure is expensed as incurred.\n\n## Amortisation\n\nGoodwill and brand names are not amortised.\n\nFor intangible assets with /finite lives, amortisation is recognised in the pro/fit or loss on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life. The estimated useful lives of intangible assets in this category are as follows:\n\n- \u00bb Software\n\n3 - 10 years\n\n- \u00bb Product trademarks   4 - 10 years\n- \u00bb Patents\n\n13 - 15 years\n\n- \u00bb Customer contracts   10 - 17 years\n\nUseful lives are reviewed at each reporting date and adjusted where relevant.\n\n## 12. Impairment of goodwill and non-current assets\n\n## Impairment testing of goodwill\n\nThe Group performs annual impairment testing as at 30 September for intangible assets with inde/finite useful lives. More frequent reviews are performed for indicators of impairment of all the Group's assets, including operating assets. The 30 September impairment testing resulted in no impairment of any CGU as the recoverable amounts of the CGU's, being Fertilisers APAC, DNAP, DNA continuing operations and Titanobel exceeded their carrying amounts. The Group has assessed the discontinued WALA operations for impairment by comparing the assets held for sale carrying amount against the proceeds expected from the sale. No impairment was noted.\n\n## Key assumptions\n\nDetails of the key assumptions used in the recoverable amount calculations at 30 September are set out below:\n\n| Key assumptions   | 1 - 5 years   | 1 - 5 years   | Terminal value   (after 5 years) 2022   | Terminal value   (after 5 years) 2022   |\n|-------------------|---------------|---------------|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|\n|                   | 2023          | 2022          | 2023                                    |                                         |\n|                   | US$           | US$           | US$                                     | US$                                     |\n| DAP  (1)          | 451 to 668    | 467 to 786    | 688                                     | 560                                     |\n| AUD:USD  (2)      | 0.70 to 0.72  | 0.71 to 0.74  | 0.72                                    | 0.73                                    |\n\nFor both DNAP and Fertilisers APAC, the gas price assumption for impairment testing purposes for the /first period after the current gas contracts expire, is based on external long term gas production cost forecasts of between $8.50 and $9.51 per gigajoule.\n\nFertiliser prices and foreign exchange rates are estimated by reference to external market publications and market analyst estimates where available, and are updated at each reporting date.\n\n## Discount and growth rates\n\nThe post-tax discount rate used in the calculations is 9% for the Fertilisers APAC CGU (2022: 9%), 8.5% for the DNA and DNAP CGUs (2022: 8.5%) and 9% for the Titanobel CGU (2022: 9%). The rate re/flects the underlying cost of capital adjusted for market and asset speci/fic risks.\n\nThe terminal value growth rate represents the forecast consumer price index (CPI) of 2.5% (2022: 2.5%) for all CGUs. Sensitivity analyses on the discount and growth rates, considering the current volatile market conditions, are provided below.\n\n## Climate Related Risks\n\nIPL considers climate change and other sustainability risks when determining the recoverable amount of each CGU. The Group has greenhouse gas emission reduction targets for its manufacturing facilities which are disclosed in the annual Sustainability Report. Capital forecasts in the cash /flows used in the impairment models include investment in sustainability related projects that have either commenced or are committed, including the earnings attributable to these capital projects.\n\nThe commodity forecast assumptions used in the impairment models were obtained from external sources which include the impacts of sustainability and carbon costs.\n\nFor both DNAP and Fertilisers APAC, the estimated impact of the Safeguard Mechanism (SGM) 2.0 policy was included in the recoverable amount assessment of each CGU. Refer below, for further information on SGM estimates and assumptions.\n\n## Safeguard Mechanism (SGM)\n\nFor the Fertilisers CGU, the Phosphate Hill facility is in scope. A cost to comply with the SGM has been included in cash /flow forecasts supporting the carrying value of Fertilisers net assets. This cost re/flects the assumed cost of purchasing Australian Carbon Credit Units to o/ffset emissions above the baseline set by the SGM. In forecasting this cost, assumptions have been developed with respect to future emissions, future production levels, the market value of carbon credits and baseline decline rates (including an assessment of Phosphate Hill as a Trade Exposed facility).\n\nFor the DNAP CGU, the Moranbah manufacturing facility is in scope of the SGM given the plant's historical level of emissions. The Moranbah N2O abatement project which has been approved for installation in 2024 is anticipated to reduce emissions to a level below the baseline in the near term. As the baseline of the facility declines, this bene/fit will reduce. This outlook has been factored into cash /flow forecasts for the DNAP CGU.",

Where an indicator of impairment is identi/fied, a formal impairment assessment is performed. The Group's annual impairment testing determines whether the recoverable amount of a CGU or group of CGUs, to which goodwill and/or inde/finite life intangible assets are allocated, exceeds its carrying amount.\n\nA CGU is the smallest identi/fiable group of assets that generate cash /flows largely independent of cash /flows of other groups of assets. Goodwill and other inde/finite life intangible assets are allocated to CGUs or groups of CGUs which are no larger than one of the Group's reportable segments.\n\n## Determining the recoverable amount\n\nThe recoverable amount of an asset is determined as the higher of its fair value less cost of disposal and its value-in-use. Value-inuse is a term that means an asset's value based on the expected future cash /flows arising from its continued use in its current condition, discounted to present value. For discounting purposes, a post-tax rate is used that re/flects current market assessments of the risks speci/fic to the asset. The Group has prepared value-in-use models for the purpose of impairment testing as at 30 September 2023, using /five year discounted cash /flow models based on Board approved forecasts. Cash /flows beyond the /five year period are extrapolated using a terminal value growth rate.\n\nTransition of the world's energy systems and sustainability forms part of our strategy and these have been considered in the market data utilised to assess growth rates for each CGU.\n\n## Impairment losses\n\nAn impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset (or its CGU) exceeds its recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognised in the pro/fit or loss.\n\nImpairment losses recognised in respect of CGUs are allocated against assets in the following order:\n\n- \u00bb Firstly, against the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the CGU.\n- \u00bb Secondly, against the carrying amount of any remaining assets in the CGU.\n\nAn impairment loss recognised in a prior period for an asset (or its CGU) other than goodwill may be reversed only if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount of the asset (or its CGU) since the last impairment loss was recognised. When this is the case, the carrying amount of the asset (or its CGU) is increased to its recoverable amount.\n\n## Key estimates and judgments\n\nThe Group is required to make signi/ficant estimates and judgments in determining whether the carrying amount of its assets and/or CGUs has any indication of impairment, in particular in relation to:\n\n- \u00bb key assumptions used in forecasting future cash /flows;\n- \u00bb discount rates applied to those cash /flows; and\n- \u00bb the expected long term growth in cash /flows.\n\nSuch estimates and judgments are subject to change as a result of changing economic, operational, environmental and weather conditions. Actual cash /flows may therefore di/ffer from forecasts and could result in changes in the recognition of impairment charges in future periods.",

Commitments\n\n## Capital expenditure commitments\n\nCapital expenditure contracted but not provided for or payable at 30 September:\n\n|                        |   2023  $mill |   2022  $mill |\n|------------------------|---------------|---------------|\n| No later than one year |          78.5 |         102.3 |\n|                        |          78.5 |         102.3 |\n\n## Other commitments\n\nIn May 2023, IPL entered into a long-term gas supply agreement with Queensland Paci/fic Metals (QPM) commencing in April 2026 upon expiry of the existing gas supply agreement. As part of the arrangement, Dyno Nobel will provide initial development funding facility of up to $80m. This facility will be used to accelerate development of the Moranbah gas pipeline by funding the capital costs of new in/fill production wells.\n\nIt is anticipated that approximately $40m of the funding will be provided during the 2024 /financial year, with the remainder to be provided in the 2025 /financial year. Dyno Nobel will recognise the cash out/flow as a prepayment which will be amortised over the duration of the gas supply agreement with QPM.\n\n## 14. Discontinued operations\n\nIn March 2023, the Group announced that it had reached an agreement for the sale of its ammonia manufacturing facility located in Waggaman, Louisiana, USA (WALA) to CF Industries Holdings Inc (CF) for a total value of US$1.675bn.\n\nIPL also announced that it had secured a 25-year ammonia supply agreement with CF for up to 200,000 short tonnes of ammonia per annum to support the Dyno Nobel Americas (DNA) explosives business. The ammonia supply agreement secures ammonia at producer cost for the DNA business. The original value allocated to the ammonia supply agreement was US$425m which will be o/ffset from the cash proceeds of the sale agreement for Waggaman resulting in expected net cash proceeds (after transaction costs, purchase price adjustments and tax) of approximately US$850m.  For accounting purposes, the o/ff-take agreement will be valued based on the outlook for ammonia prices at the time of recognising the asset. Based on the current ammonia and gas price outlook, the value of the o/fftake agreement for accounting purposes is estimated to be approximately US$300m.\n\nAs a result of the agreement, IPL retains access to 25% of the equivalent WALA volumes and associated /financial and strategic bene/fits. The pro/fit margin on the 200,000 short tonnes previously reported as part of the WALA result will transfer to the DNA Explosives and AG&IC businesses. The divestment remains subject to US anti-trust regulatory clearance.

Classi/fication as a discontinued operation occurs at the earlier of disposal date or when the operation meets the criteria to be classi/fied as held for sale. In the case of the Waggaman operations, the re-classi/fication was made in November 2022 when the assets and liabilities met the de/finition as held for sale.\n\nThe comparative income statement and statement of comprehensive income has been presented as if the operation had been discontinued from the start of the comparative year.\n\nOnce classi/fied as held for sale, the disposal group is measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell and intangible assets and property, plant and equipment are no longer amortised or depreciated.",

This estimate is based on a 'present value' calculation, which involves the application of a discount rate to the expected future cash /flows associated with settlement. The discount rate takes into account factors such as risks speci/fic to the liability and the time value of money.\n\n## Employee entitlements\n\nProvisions are made for liabilities to employees for annual leave, long service leave and other employee entitlements. Where the payment to employees is expected to take place in 12 months time or later, a present value calculation is performed. In this instance, the corporate bond rate is used to discount the liability to its present value.\n\n## Restructuring and rationalisation\n\nProvisions for restructuring or rationalisation are only recognised when a detailed plan has been approved and the restructuring or rationalisation has either commenced or been publicly announced.\n\n## Environmental\n\nProvisions relating to the remediation of soil, groundwater, untreated waste and other environmental contamination are made when the Group has an obligation to carry out the clean-up operation as a result of a past event. In addition, a provision will only be made where it is possible to reliably estimate the costs involved.\n\n## Asset retirement\n\nIn certain circumstances, the Group has an obligation to dismantle and remove an asset and to restore the site on which it is located. The present value of the estimated costs of this process is recognised as part of the asset that is depreciated and also as a provision.\n\nAt each reporting date, the provision is remeasured in line with changes in discount rates and the timing and amount of future estimated cash /flows. Any changes in the provision are added to or deducted from the related asset, other than changes associated with the passage of time which is recognised as a borrowing cost in the pro/fit or loss.\n\n## Legal and other\n\nThere are a number of legal claims and other exposures, including claims for damages arising from products and services supplied by the Group, that arise from the ordinary course of business.\n\nA provision is only made where it is probable that a payment or restitution will be required and the costs involved can be reliably estimated.\n\n## Key estimates and judgments\n\nProvisions are based on the Group's estimate of the timing and value of out/flows of resources required to settle or satisfy commitments and liabilities known to the Group at the reporting date.\n\n## Contingencies\n\nThe following contingent liabilities are considered unlikely. However the directors consider they should be disclosed:\n\n- \u00bb Under the terms of the ASIC Legislative Instrument, ASIC Corporations (Wholly-owned Companies) Instrument 2016/785, issued by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission dated 17 December 2016, which relieved certain wholly-owned subsidiaries from the requirement to prepare audited /financial statements, IPL and certain whollyowned subsidiaries (identi/fied in note 16) have entered into an approved deed for the cross guarantee of liabilities. No additional liabilities subject to the Deed of Cross Guarantee at 30 September 2023 are expected to arise to IPL or the relevant subsidiaries.\n- \u00bb The Group is regularly subject to investigations and audit activities by the revenue authorities of jurisdictions in which the Group operates. The outcome of these investigations and audits depends upon several factors which may result in further tax payments or refunds of tax payments already made by the Group over and above existing provisions. Refer to note 3 for further details.\n- \u00bb Contingent liabilities arise in the normal course of business and include a number of legal claims, environmental cleanup requirements and bank guarantees.\n- \u00bb In May 2023, IPL announced entry into a new long-term gas supply agreement for the Moranbah ammonium nitrate plant with wholly owned subsidiaries of Queensland Paci/fic Metals Ltd (QPM). IPL have provided QPM with a corporate guarantee until February 2025 to guarantee performance of contracts relating to operations of the Moranbah gas project. The value of the guarantee reduces on a monthly basis until the obligations of QPM have been satis/fied.\n\nThe Directors are of the opinion that no additional provisions are required in respect of these matters, as it is either not probable that a future sacri/fice of economic bene/fits will be required or the amount is not capable of reliable measurement.",

Financial risk management\n\nThe Group is exposed to /financial risks including liquidity risk, market risk and credit risk. This note explains the Group's /financial risk exposures and its objectives, policies and processes for measuring and managing these risks.\n\nThe Board of Directors (the Board ) has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Group's risk management framework. The Board established the Audit and Risk Management Committee ( ARMC ) which is responsible for, amongst other things, the monitoring of the Group's risk management plans. The ARMC is assisted in its oversight role by the Group's Risk Management function. The Risk Management function performs reviews of the Group's risk management controls and procedures, the results of which are reported to the ARMC. The ARMC reports regularly to the Board on its activities.\n\nThe Group's /financial risk management framework includes policies to identify, analyse and manage the Group's /financial risks. These policies set appropriate /financial risk limits and controls, identify permitted derivative instruments and provide guidance on how to monitor and report /financial risks and adherence to set limits. Financial risk management policies, procedures and systems are reviewed regularly to ensure they remain appropriate given changes in market conditions and/or the Group's activities.\n\n## Financial risks\n\nLiquidity risk: The risk that the Group is not able to re/finance its debt obligations or meet other cash out/flow obligations when required.\n\n## Source of risk\n\nExposure to liquidity risk derives from the Group's operations and from the external interest bearing liabilities that it holds.\n\n## Risk mitigation\n\nLiquidity risk is managed by ensuring there are su/fficient committed funding facilities available to meet the Group's /financial commitments in a timely manner.\n\nThe Group's forecast liquidity requirements are continually reassessed based on regular forecasting of earnings and capital requirements.\n\n## Outstanding /financial instruments\n\nThe Group's exposures to liquidity risk are set out in the tables below:\n\n| 30 September 2023                          | Contractual  cash /flows  (1) $mill        | 0 -

Any hedging performed in these circumstances would be executed using instruments that allow as much participation in favourable movements while limiting downside risk to an acceptable level.

The sensitivity is based on natural gas derivative contracts held by the Group at 30 September. Gains or losses recognised in equity will be reclassi/fied to the pro/fit or loss as the underlying forecast transaction occurs:\n\n| Natural gas price  sensitivity   |   +US 10c  per 1   MMBTU   AUD mill   2023 | -US 10c  per 1  MMBTU   AUD mill  2023   | +US 10c  per 1  MMBTU  AUD mill  2022   | -US 10c   per 1  MMBTU  AUD mill  2022   |\n|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|\n| Henry Hub USD                    |                                        0.1 | (0.1)                                    | -                                       | -                                        |\n\n## Risk mitigation\n\nWhere possible, commodity price risk exposure is managed by entering into long term contracts with customers (i.e Ammonium Nitrate and Ammonia) or derivative contracts for input cost (i.e US natural gas). However, in some instances price risk exposure cannot be economically mitigated by either contractual arrangements or derivative contracts by virtue of the products that the Group sells.\n\n## Sensitivity to natural gas price movements during the year\n\nThe table below shows the sensitivity of the Group's pro/fit before tax to a change of US 10c per MMBTU in the US Henry Hub natural gas price. The sensitivity is based on the average natural gas price, the average AUD:USD exchange rate (excluding the impact of hedging) and the current annual natural gas consumption of the Group's manufacturing operations in the Americas that are exposed to changes in natural gas prices:\n\n|                                | +US  10c    per 1  MMBTU   | -US 10c  per 1  MMBTU   | +US 10c  per 1  MMBTU   | -US 10c   per 1  MMBTU   |\n|--------------------------------|----------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|--------------------------|\n| Natural gas price  sensitivity | AUD mill  2023             | AUD mill  2023          | AUD mill  2022          | AUD mill  2022           |\n| Henry Hub USD                  | (3.8)                      | 3.8                     | (2.7)                   | 2.7                      |\n\n## Sensitivity to fertiliser price and ammonia movements during the year\n\nThe table below shows the sensitivity of the Group's pro/fit before tax to a US$10 per tonne change in Ammonium Phosphates, Urea and Ammonia prices. The sensitivity is based on actual tonnes manufactured and sold by the Group that is sensitive to commodity price changes and the average AUD:USD exchange rate (excluding the impact of hedging) for the year:\n\n| Price sensitivity                   | + US$10  per tonne  AUD mill   | - US$10   per tonne  AUD mill   |\n|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------|---------------------------------|\n| 2023                                |                                |                                 |\n| Granular Urea (FOB Middle East) (1) | 2.4                            | (2.4)                           |\n| DAP/MAP (FOB China/Saudi)           | 12.4                           | (12.4)                          |\n| Urea (FOB NOLA)                     | 1.9                            | (1.9)                           |\n| Ammonia (FOB Tampa) (2)             | 10.4                           | (10.4)                          |\n| 2022                                |                                |                                 |\n| Granular Urea (FOB Middle East) (1) | 3.4                            | (3.4)                           |\n| DAP/MAP (FOB China/Saudi)           | 10.5                           | (10.5)                          |\n| Urea (FOB NOLA)                     | 2.4                            | (2.4)                           |\n| Ammonia (FOB Tampa) (2)             | 7.9                            | (7.9)                           |",

Credit limits are established and monitored for each customer, and these limits represent the highest level of exposure that a customer can reach. Trade credit insurance is purchased when required.\n\nThe Group mitigates credit risk from /financial instrument contracts by only entering into transactions with counterparties that have sound credit ratings and, where applicable, with whom the Group has a signed netting agreement. Given their high credit ratings, the Group does not expect any counterparty to fail to meet its obligations.\n\n## Fair value\n\nFair value of the Group's /financial assets and liabilities is calculated using a variety of techniques depending on the type of /financial instrument as follows:\n\n- \u00bb The fair value of /financial assets and /financial liabilities traded in active markets (such as equity securities and /fixed interest rate bonds) is the quoted market price at the reporting date.\n- \u00bb The fair value of /financial assets and /financial liabilities not traded in active markets is calculated using discounted cash /flows. Future cash /flows are calculated based on observable forward interest rates and foreign exchange rates.\n- \u00bb The fair value of forward exchange contracts, interest rate swaps, cross currency interest rate swaps, commodity swaps and forward contracts is calculated using discounted cash /flows, re/flecting the credit risk of various counterparties. Future cash /flows are calculated based on the contract rate, observable forward interest rates and foreign exchange rates.\n- \u00bb The fair value of option contracts is calculated using the contract rates and observable market rates at the end of the reporting period, re/flecting the credit risk of various counterparties.The valuation technique is consistent with the Black-Scholes methodology and utilises Monte Carlo simulations.\n- \u00bb The fair value of commodity swaps and commodity forward contracts is calculated using their quoted market price, where available. If a quoted market price is not available, then fair value is calculated using discounted cash /flows. Future cash /flows are estimated based on the di/fference between the contractual price and the current observable market price, re/flecting the credit risk of various counterparties. These future cash /flows are then discounted to present value.\n- \u00bb The nominal value less expected credit losses of trade receivables and payables are assumed to approximate their fair values due to their short term maturity.\n\n## Credit risk exposure\n\nThe Group's maximum exposure to credit risk at 30 September is the carrying amount, net of any provision for impairment, of the /financial assets as detailed in the table below:\n\n|                             | 2023   $mill   | 2022  $mill   |\n|-----------------------------|----------------|---------------|\n| Trade and other receivables | 597.9          | 785.3         |\n| Cash and cash equivalents   | 399.4          | 763.5         |\n| Derivative assets           | 16.9           | 37.3          |\n|                             | 1,014.2        | 1,586.1       |\n\nFinancial assets and /financial liabilities that are subject to enforceable master netting arrangements and are intended to be settled on a net basis are o/ffset in the Statement of Financial Position. At 30 September 2023, the amount netted in other /financial assets and other /financial liabilities is nil (2022: $79.8m).\n\n## Fair value hierarchy\n\nThe table below analyses /financial instruments carried at fair value by valuation method. The di/fferent levels have been de/fined as follows:\n\n- \u00bb Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\n- \u00bb Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).\n- \u00bb Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).\n\n| 2023                              | Level 1  $mill   | Level 2   $mill   | Level 3  $mill   |\n|-----------------------------------|------------------|-------------------|------------------|\n| Derivative /financial assets      | -                | 16.9              | -                |\n| Derivative /financial liabilities | -                | (96.8)            | -                |\n\n| 2022                              | Level 1  $mill   | Level 2   $mill   | Level 3  $mill   |\n|-----------------------------------|------------------|-------------------|------------------|\n| Derivative /financial assets      | -                | 37.3              | -                |\n| Derivative /financial liabilities | -                | (152.6)           | -                |\n\n## Fair value of /financial assets and liabilities carried at amortised cost\n\nCash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables, and trade and other payables are carried at amortised cost which equals their fair value.\n\nInterest bearing liabilities are carried at amortised cost and have a carrying value of $1,731.7m (2022: $1,712.0m) - refer to note 8. The fair value of the interest bearing /financial liabilities at 30 September 2023 was $1,693.3m (2022: $1,655.0m) and was based on the level 2 valuation methodology.",

        "page_content": "## NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS: RISK MANAGEMENT\n\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 SEPTEMBER 2023\n\n## Key accounting policies\n\n## Foreign currency transactions and balances\n\nThe Group presents its accounts in Australian dollars. Foreign currency transactions are translated into Australian dollars using the exchange rates at the date the transaction occurs.\n\nMonetary assets (such as trade receivables) and liabilities (such as trade creditors) denominated in foreign currencies are translated into Australian dollars using the exchange rate at 30 September. Non-monetary items (for example, plant and machinery) that are measured at historical cost in a foreign currency are not re-translated.\n\nForeign exchange gains and losses relating to transactions are recognised in the pro/fit or loss with the exception of gains and losses arising from cash /flow hedges and net investment hedges that are recognised in other comprehensive income.\n\n## Foreign operations\n\nThe assets and liabilities of the Group's foreign operations are translated at applicable exchange rates at 30 September. Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the period.\n\nForeign exchange gains and losses arising on translation are recognised in the foreign currency translation reserve ( FCTR ). If and when the Group disposes of the foreign operation, these gains and losses are transferred from the FCTR to the pro/fit or loss.\n\n## Derivatives and hedging\n\nThe Group uses contracts known as derivative /financial instruments to hedge its /financial risk exposures.\n\nOn entering into a hedging relationship, the Group formally designates and documents details of the hedge, risk management objective and strategy for entering into the arrangement. The Group applies hedge accounting to hedging relationships that are expected to be highly e/ffective in o/ffsetting changes in fair value, i.e. where the cash /flows arising from the hedge instrument closely match the cash /flows arising from the hedged item.\n\nHedge accounting is discontinued when:\n\n- \u00bb The hedging relationship no longer meets the risk management objective.\n- \u00bb The hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised.\n- \u00bb The hedge no longer quali/fies for hedge accounting.\n\nDerivatives are measured at fair value. The accounting treatment applied to speci/fic types of hedges is set out below.\n\n## Cash /flow hedges\n\nChanges in the fair value of e/ffective cash /flow hedges are recognised in equity, in the cash /flow hedge reserve. To the extent that the hedge is ine/ffective, changes in fair value are recognised in the pro/fit or loss.\n\nFair value gains or losses accumulated in the reserve are taken to pro/fit or loss when the hedged item a/ffects pro/fit or loss. When the hedged item is a non-/financial asset, the amount recognised in the reserve is transferred to the carrying amount of the asset when the asset is purchased.\n\n## Net investment hedges\n\nHedges of a net investment in a foreign operation are accounted for in a similar way as cash /flow hedges. Gains or losses on the e/ffective portion of the hedge are recognised directly in equity (in the FCTR) while any gains or losses relating to the ine/ffective portion are recognised in the pro/fit or loss.\n\nOn disposal of the foreign operation, the cumulative value of gains or losses recognised in the FCTR are transferred to pro/fit or loss.\n\n## Fair value hedges\n\nThe change in the fair value of the hedging instrument and the change in the hedged item are recognised in the pro/fit or loss.\n\n## Hedge ine/ffectiveness\n\nThe Group aims to transact only highly e/ffective hedge relationships, and in most cases the hedging instruments have a 1:1 hedge ratio with the hedged items. However, at times, some hedge ine/ffectiveness can arise and is recognised in pro/fit or loss in the period in which it occurs. Key sources of hedge ine/ffectiveness for the Group are as follows:\n\n- \u00bb Maturity dates of hedging instruments not matching the maturity dates of the hedged items.\n- \u00bb Credit risk inherent within the hedging instrument not matching the movement in the hedged item.\n- \u00bb Interest rates of the Group's /financing facilities not matching the interest rates of the hedging instrument.\n- \u00bb Forecast transactions not occurring.\n\n## Classi/fication of /financial instruments\n\nFinancial instruments are classi/fied into the following categories:\n\n- \u00bb Amortised cost (cash and cash equivalents, interest bearing liabilities and trade and other receivables and payables).\n- \u00bb Fair value through other comprehensive income (listed equity securities).\n- \u00bb Fair value through pro/fit or loss (derivative /financial instruments except those that are in a designated hedge relationship).",

With regard to the 2020/23, 2021/24 and 2022/25 LTIs, the performance conditions comprise relative total shareholder return, the delivery of certain long term value metrics and return on invested capital. Additionally, the 2021/24 and 2022/25 LTIs include sustainability conditions.\n\nCertain Executives have been awarded performance rights under Short Term Incentive Plans (STIs) based on /financial, safety and strategic outcomes.\n\nThese arrangements support the Company's strategy for retention and motivation of its executives.\n\n## Expenses arising from share-based payment transactions\n\nTotal expenses arising from share-based payment transactions recognised during the period as part of employee bene/fit expense were as follows:\n\n|                                                                                        |   2023   $mill |   2022   $mill |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|----------------|\n| Accounting value of performance rights issued  under the LTI and STI performance plans |            2.9 |            3.1 |\n\n|                                                                                   | 2023  Number   | 2022   Number   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|-----------------|\n| Number of performance rights outstanding  under the LTI and STI performance plans | 5,302,195      | 5,887,136       |\n\nDetails of the movements in LTI and STI performance rights are disclosed in the Remuneration Report for key management personnel.\n\n## Key accounting policies\n\nThe rights to shares granted to employees under the terms of the plans are measured at fair value. The fair value is recognised as an employee expense over the period that employees become unconditionally entitled to the rights. There is a corresponding increase in equity, which is re/flected in the share based payments reserve.\n\nThe amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to re/flect the actual number of rights taken up, once related service and other non-market conditions are met.\n\n## 20.

The following table summarises how the de/fined bene/fit obligation as at 30 September 2023 would have increased/(decreased) as a result of a change in the respective assumption by 1 percentage point:\n\n|                         | 1 percent  increase   | 1 percent  decrease   |\n|-------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|\n| Discount rate           | (7.0)                 | 8.4                   |\n| Rate of salary increase | 1.0                   | (0.8)                 |\n\n## Key accounting policies\n\nAll employees of the group are entitled to bene/fits from the Group's superannuation plan on retirement, disability or death or can direct the group to make contributions to a de/fined contribution plan of their choice. The Group's superannuation plan has a de/fined bene/fit section and a de/fined contribution section. The de/fined bene/fit section provides de/fined lump sum bene/fits based on years of service and /final average salary. The de/fined contribution section receives /fixed contributions from group companies and the Group's legal or constructive obligation is limited to these contributions.\n\nThe liability or asset recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position in respect of de/fined bene/fit superannuation plans is the present value of the de/fined bene/fit obligation at the end of the reporting period less the fair value of plan assets.\n\nRemeasurement gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are recognised in the period in which they occur, directly in other comprehensive income. They are included in retained earnings in the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity and in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position.\n\nChanges in the present value of the de/fined bene/fit obligation resulting from plan amendments or curtailments are recognised immediately in pro/fit or loss as past service costs.\n\nContributions to the de/fined contribution section of the Group's superannuation fund and other independent de/fined contribution superannuation funds are recognised as an expense as they become payable.\n\n## Key estimates and judgments\n\nThe present value of the de/fined bene/fit obligation at the reporting date is based on expected future payments arising from membership of the fund. This is calculated annually by independent actuaries considering the expected future wage and salary levels of employees, experience of employee departures and employee periods of service.\n\nExpected future payments are discounted using market yields on corporate bonds at the reporting date, which have terms to maturity and currency that match, as closely as possible, the estimated future cash out/flows.",

If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n## Responsibilities of the Directors for the Financial Report\n\nThe directors of the Company are responsible for the preparation of the financial report that gives a true and fair view in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards and the Corporations Act 2001 and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of the financial report that gives a true and fair view and is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the financial report, the directors are responsible for assessing the ability of the Group to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\n## Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Report\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial report as a whole is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the Australian Auditing Standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of this financial report.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with the Australian Auditing Standards, we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n\n- \u00b7 Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial report, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient  and  appropriate  to  provide  a  basis  for  our  opinion.  The  risk  of  not  detecting  a  material misstatement  resulting  from  fraud  is  higher  than  for  one  resulting  from  error,  as  fraud  may  involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- \u00b7 Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are  appropriate  in  the  circumstances,  but  not  for  the  purpose  of  expressing  an  opinion  on  the effectiveness of the Group's internal control.\n- \u00b7 Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the directors.\n- \u00b7 Conclude on the appropriateness of the director's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based  on  the  audit  evidence  obtained,  whether  a  material  uncertainty  exists  related  to  events  or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the financial report or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our  conclusions  are  based  on  the  audit  evidence  obtained  up  to  the  date  of  our  auditor's  report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.\n- \u00b7 Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial report, including the disclosures, and whether the financial report represents the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.",

We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the Group's audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.\n\nWe communicate with the directors  regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.\n\nWe  also  provide  the  directors  with  a  statement  that  we  have  complied  with  relevant  ethical  requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, actions taken to eliminate threats or safeguards applied.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with the directors, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial report of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\n\n## R Reeppoorrtt  oonn  tthhee  RReemmuunneerraattiioonn  RReeppoorrtt\n\nOpinion on the Remuneration Report\n\nWe have audited the Remuneration Report included in pages 62 to 82 of the Director's Report for the year ended 30 September 2023.\n\nIn our opinion, the Remuneration Report of the Incitec Pivot Limited, for the year ended 30 September 2023, complies with section 300A of the Corporations Act 2001 .\n\n## Responsibilities\n\nThe directors of the Company are responsible for the preparation and presentation of the Remuneration Report in accordance with section 300A of the Corporations Act 2001 .
