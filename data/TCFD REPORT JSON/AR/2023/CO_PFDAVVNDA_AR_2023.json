In Colombia, we experienced the lowest economic growth in the last decade - excluding the pandemic joined by lower credit offering and demand, as well as high deposit and lending interest rates.\n\nOur financial results reflected the challenging operating environment that has materialized since mid-2022, being impacted by higher funding costs that pressured our net interest margin and higher provisioning expenses.\n\nWithin this context, we have capitalized on several lessons to strengthen our management, by taking several measures to protect our business' performance. For example, we have been implementing various strategies to improve our credit portfolio profile, to\n\ngradually adjust our funding composition safeguarding our margins, to strengthen other sources of income, and to improve productivity, so that we can capture greater efficiencies in our operations.\n\nAmidst these challenges, we have maintained our capital strength, with a Total Capital Adequacy Ratio of 14.54% and a Common Equity Tier 1 Ratio of 10.25% by the end of 2023, solid and sufficient levels to continue developing our business. Additionally, we continue to support our 23.6 million customers in Colombia and Central America, with a market share of 15.17% 1 and 8,96% 2 , respectively, and a gross loan portfolio of COP 136 3 trillion.\n\n- 1 Source: Financial Superintendence of Colombia.

We remain focused on our strategy, leveraging our digital capabilities and sustainable management, to continue working towards our higher purpose.\n\nFor over more than 50 years, we have faced and overcome various obstacles, and each challenge has been a valuable lesson that strengthens our resilience and drives us to continue building the bank of the future.\n\nOur innovative DNA and the digital capabilities we have developed over the years position us to generate greater value for our stakeholders going forward. Thanks to these skills, we have managed to build one of the most comprehensive digital offerings of financial services for individuals in Colombia, and we continue to complement our offering for businesses. In Central America, we are pioneers with digital solutions that respond to the dynamics of each country.\n\nAs evidence of this, 91% of our clients are digital: around 93% in Colombia and 69% in Central America. In the past year, we have launched several products and functionalities for them, to continue guaranteeing reliable, user-friendly, and simple experiences for our clients, such as the Super App for individuals, our new App for Businesses, a new service model leveraged on Vivi (our virtual assistant based on Artificial Intelligence), interoperable QR code, among others.\n\nThrough these and other solutions, we are aiming to create and participate in ecosystems with financial and non-financial services, being an organization that goes beyond Banking, finding new ways to reach our clients and enabling our offering to be just a click away in the ecosystems where they live.\n\nOn the other hand, DaviPlata continues to demonstrate its ability to be the easy banking solution for everyone, reaching nearly 17.4 million customers in 2023, with deposits close to COP 993 billion. For 4.3 million people, DaviPlata was their only financial product, and 31 thousand customers received their first nanocredit, thanks to Daviplata.\n\nWe continue to see great monetization potential in DaviPlata's value proposition, which has proven to be a successful product to reach different segments of the population, promoting financial inclusion and the growth of businesses and small enterprises.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

In line with this commitment, we are positioned as leaders in service in Colombia and in Central America, and we continue to work so that more customers prefer Davivienda.\n\nIn short, we will continue to leverage on our transformative capacity to lead innovation in the banking sector, offering cutting-edge experiences with exceptional service levels that will allow us to continue consolidating our position.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## OUR STRATEGY IS SUSTAINABLE\n\nResponsible banking is one of the most important pillars of Davivienda, and every day we work towards harmonizing economic objectives with global commitments to the environment and society.\n\nIn 2023, our sustainable loan portfolio increased by around 20% compared to 2022, reaching COP 17.1 trillion, representing a 12.6% share of the total gross loan portfolio. We are consistently advancing towards our goal of making 30% of our portfolio sustainable by 2030.\n\nWe continue to be the leading bank in mortgage financing in Colombia, with a market share of approximately 26.40% 4 as a result of our firm commitment to contribute to the wellbeing and improvement of people's living conditions, bridging basic needs and multidimensional poverty gaps. Additionally, we have supported nearly 5 million people, especially women, in fulfilling their dream of owning a dignified home and building their wealth and social capital. We also\n\nworked closely with constructors to develop more environmentally sustainable certified homes.\n\nFurthermore, we aim to reduce the gender gap in access to financial products. Currently, about 9.7 million of our customers are women, and we have financed over 52 thousand SMEs, with 12 thousand of them being led by women in Colombia and El Salvador, progressing towards our goal of increasing the women's participation in our SME portfolio.\n\nBeyond being a banking solution, we aim to transcend towards the health and financial well-being of our customers through tailored products and services, as well as financial education content. In 2023, this content reached nearly 19 million people, including both customers and non-customers, from children to retirees.\n\n- 4 Source: Financial Superintendence of Colombia.

One of our action plans is to increase our disbursements in environmentally sustainable projects.\n\nFor example, in the agricultural sector, we work to improve access to financing for the sector companies, as well as to protect the most vulnerable population. We reach small-scale producers with financial inclusion solutions, technical assistance and climate adaptation. In this regard, we closed 2023 with a 14% market share in the agricultural sector, financing 52 thousand producers, over 30 thousand SMEs in 763 municipalities in Colombia, and providing climate change protection through parametric insurance to nearly 14 thousand lowincome small-scale producers. This solution was designed in partnership with Finagro and Seguros Bol\u00edvar.\n\nOn the other hand, we acknowledge that our impacts and dependencies on climate and biodiversity are concentrated not in our operations\n\n## WE INCREASED\n\nour participation in financing green businesses with lower emissions and we financed projects that contribute to energy transition and efficiency.\n\nbut in the activities we finance. Therefore, we measure on an annual basis the evolution of greenhouse gas emissions from our asset portfolio, initially focusing on commercial banking and some investment vehicles.\n\nThus, we act to guide our corporate and business clients on their path towards an orderly, fair, and equitable energy transition, increasing our involvement in financing low-emission green businesses, funding projects that contribute to energy transition and efficiency, renewable energy generation, optimization of productive resources, cleaner production, and sustainable infrastructure.\n\nAdditionally, in order to strengthen our actions in terms of financial health, climate, and nature management, and in line with our vision of being NetZero by 2050, in 2023 we joined various initiatives such as UNEP FI (United Nations Environment Programme Finance Initiative) and its Principles for Responsible Banking (PRB), as well as the NZBA (Net Zero Banking Alliance), GFANZ (Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero), and SBTi (Science Based Targets Initiative).\n\nAt Davivienda, we are committed to making the world our home, and we will continue working to make it more prosperous, inclusive, and green.",

From these, we recognized the key issues that the financial sector must manage from the dimensions of ESG sustainability (Environmental, Social and Corporate Governance), as well as the short and long-term risks prioritized by the World Economic Forum in its Global Risk Report 2023.\n\n## EVALUATION OF THE CURRENT SITUATION OF DAVIVIENDA\n\nThis stage was divided into two activities; the first was an analysis of the evolution of the Bank's materiality matrices, to understand how, throughout the different exercises, we were transforming the prioritization of material issues, according to the context and the focuses of the organization's strategy.\n\nThe second stage consisted of an analysis of our potential gaps with respect to the industry's best practices, taking into account the score obtained in international evaluations such as the CSA 8 , Sustainalytics and MSCI 9 , and with respect to the provisions of External Circular 031 of 2022 of the Superintendence of Finance of Colombia.

In Colombia, for the projects and activities that we finance for our clients in the Corporate, Construction, Business and leasing operations segments, we performed 275 environmental and social risk assessments corresponding to COP 9.1 billion, as well as 650 monitoring of current loans. Environmental and social risk assessments of projects reached a coverage of 64% based on the total number of project finance and housing construction projects financially evaluated; of these 340 were financially closed, 47 were declined for financial reasons and one was declined for environmental issues. In addition, in Costa Rica, El Salvador, Honduras and Panama we evaluated 57 projects for USD 406.4 million and provided continuity to 194 monitoring activities.\n\nIn order to have a greater scope of SARAS in clients of the Corporate and Business segments, within the framework of the Portfolio Rating activity and in synergy with the Credit Risk area, we applied for the second consecutive year an Environmental and Social survey, obtaining a response from 1,281 companies, allowing us to know the initiatives and good practices in environmental and social matters of our clients. This same survey was applied for the first time in the Construction segment, where we had the participation of 100 companies for a total of 1,381 with a response, of which we highlight the following results:\n\n- A 43% (598) of the companies belong to or follow some reference or standard related to environmental, social or sustainability management, such as DJSI, TCFD, CDP, GRI, ISO 14001, Rainforest, or programs such as Acercar and Pread.\n- A 77% (1,063) of the companies identify the environmental and social impacts generated by their activities and implement management measures for control and mitigation.\n- A 64% (886) of the companies have implemented activities associated with the efficient use and exploitation of natural resources, in terms of energy efficiency, circular economy, water reuse, separation and delivery to authorized solid waste managers, among others.\n- A 14% (192) of the companies measure and report their carbon footprint; 133 of them indicated their total emissions in tons of CO2eq, which is the input we use for the calculation of financed emissions.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The results of these tests are used to identify risks and to  define the appetite framework within which the business plan is developed. Within the framework of stress tests, the Stress Testing Scheme (EPR) is developed under the  guidelines of Chapter XXVIII of the Basic Accounting and Financial Circular. This scheme seeks to  identify the vulnerabilities of the entities, enrich the decision-making process for risk management,  examine the quantity and quality of their capital, liquidity, assets and liabilities according to their risk  profile, as well as assess the viability of their business plans. In this way, the EPR helps to strengthen  risk management and complements the capital adequacy assessment processes.

The results obtained in the regulatory exercise are evaluated  throughout the year, becoming a reference point to monitor the actual evolution of solvency ratios  and other projected indicators, and thus evaluate possible future scenarios of Banco Davivienda to  enrich risk management. In the year 2023, the Bank conducted the EPR assuming an environment  of economic recession, high inflation, without reaching the target range of the Central Bank, high  interest rates and unemployment. This environment causes a generalized affectation of the portfolio,  especially the consumer portfolio. On the other hand, there are also adverse effects due to restrictions  in access to local and international funding.                                                                                                                                                                         |\n| Activity  parameters      | FN-CB-000.A  | 1.

In 2022, we adhered to the Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials (PCAF) to measure emissions finance, and to the Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI), which aim to promote responsible investment to create markets that contribute to a more sustainable world.\n\nIn 2023, in the interest of maturing our scope and commitment to sustainable financial practices and the integration of environmental, social and governance (ESG) criteria into our operations and investments, we joined the United Nations Environment Programme Finance Initiative (UNEP FI) and its Principles for Responsible Banking (PRB), the Net Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA) and the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ), in line with our vision to be Net-Zero by 2050, as well as the Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi) to set our science-based emissions reduction targets.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn our third TCFD report on 2023 management, we reveal our progress on climate management and our commitment to align with the most rigorous scientific standards, with a view to a just and orderly transition to zero net emissions. We share the TCFD report as an annex to this report, which can also be accessed by clicking here .\n\n## UNEP FI AND PRB\n\nIn 2023 we adhered to these initiatives to strengthen our sustainable management.",

Its role and functions are related to the strategy and monitoring of sustainable management.\n- A The Board of Directors has support committees. For climate change issues there are: the Corporate Governance and Sustainability Committee, composed of 3 members of the Board of Directors and chaired by an independent\n\nmember, and the Corporate Risk Committee, also composed of 3 members of the Board of Directors.\n\n- A Senior management plays a supervisory role. From the executive vice presidencies and their directorates, our leaders promote actions and make decisions that allow us to implement the ESG guidelines, which are defined and supervised by the Internal Sustainability Committee.\n- A The Sustainability Department proposes and promotes the integrated management of sustainability in the business strategy and the mobilization of actions in favor of the management of the material issues defined in the dual materiality (impact and financial) of 2023 and the strategic focuses of sustainable business.\n\n## WE INTEGRATE\n\nthe management of climate change risks and opportunities due to their potential to generate material financial impacts for the business.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## STRATEGY\n\nWe manage climate change as a cross-cutting issue in the organization. Our strategy is developed and strengthened through processes, products, programs and initiatives that allow us to contribute with concrete measures to mitigate and adapt to climate change.\n\nWe have also integrated the management of climate change risks and opportunities due to their potential to generate material financial impacts for the business. Supported by our Environmental and Climate\n\nChange Policy updated in 2023, in addition to international benchmarks and external commitments, and considering training and disclosure as transversal axes, we have developed our climate management with the following lines of action:\n\n- A Management through the Banks through SARAS and Environmental Products and Programs - Green Lines.\n- A Direct management of the operation through eco-efficiency actions.\n\n<!-- image -->",

We incorporated climate change risk management transversally into our overall risk management framework, along with environmental and social risk management (SARAS) established in 2011, to integrate it into each of the main verticals.\n\nWe manage physical and transitional climate change risks from the approach of current and future impacts:\n\n- A Physical risks: At the transaction level in the environmental and social risk assessment applicable to loan applications for the development of sensitive projects or activities, identifying and\n\nestablishing mitigation measures; and at the level of current loan portfolios, through the massive cross-referencing of obligations with threat maps for current and future natural risks in climate behavior scenarios.\n\n- A Transition risks: We perform sensitivity analyses of the loan portfolio to these risks and follow up on the concentration in carbonintensive sectors. To manage them, we established the climate maturity assessment for our clients, which allows us to know risks and opportunities, input information to structure relationship models or climate engagement. In line with this, we carried out the Measurement of Financed Emissions (Scope 3, Category 15), which allows us to follow up on the carbon-intensity of the credit portfolio by sectors and clients.\n\n## OBJECTIVES AND METRICS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn the process of consolidating significant results, having a metrics system is key for us, as it allows us to demonstrate the progress and achievement of the objectives and direct and indirect impacts on the business (the banks) and on the operation.\n\nWe have defined the following key metrics to evaluate the management of climate risks and opportunities in banks:\n\n- A Measurement of financed emissions: Allows us to complete the carbon emissions inventory and define baselines to establish carbon emission reduction goals and objectives in credit portfolios and investment portfolios.\n\n## A Amount of green financing:\n\n- Monitoring the performance of the portfolio balances of green financing lines, which includes the financing of climate change mitigation and adaptation projects.",

In such a way that it allows assuming an active role in risk management and the development of responsible practices, including climate change management. This policy is aligned with the Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI) promoted by the United Nations Environment Program Finance Initiative, to which Davivienda, including its subsidiaries Fiduciaria Davivienda and Corredores Davivienda, has been a signatory since 2022 (more information: click here).\n\n## A Environmental Policy: Fiduciaria\n\nDavivienda has established its Environmental Policy which, in accordance with Grupo Bolivar's mission and sustainable business strategy, recognizes that the environmental and social dimensions are fundamental to achieve sustainable development and generate benefits for the community, its shareholders, collaborators and clients. As part of the application of this policy, a guideline was established, among others, to improve the environmental and social risk management processes in the structured trust businesses in which Banco Davivienda is a financier. Both policies were approved by the Board of Directors of the Trust.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Strategy\n\n## Responsible investment in the face of climate change\n\nIn its responsible investment policy, the Fiduciary recognizes that environmental and social dimensions are fundamental.\n\n(https://sostenibilidad.davivienda.com/ )\n\nTherefore, in its process of evaluation and allocation of investment limits to issuers in the financial and real sectors, both local and international, ESG aspects are integrated in which climate change is one of the aspects to be evaluated.\n\nAs a sign of its commitment to responsible investment, in November 2022 Davivienda adhered to the UN\n\nPrinciples for Responsible Investment (PRI), also including the operations of the Fiduciaria and Corredores Davivienda.\n\nIn 2023, several working groups were held and the government was defined for the development and verification of the ERP report, this being the first year of voluntary reporting. The score obtained in this evaluation marks the route that will allow us to identify gaps in order to define and prioritize work plans.

The assessment incorporates the review of the exposure to climatic hazards of landslides and floods. Based on this review, 390 projects were identified jointly by the Trust Fund and the Bank. This exercise led to the analysis of 18% of the Trust's business, most of them being real estate products.\n\nIn addition, these projects were monitored for environmental and social risk to identify their performance in these areas.",

Next, we connect the goals and targets to our materiality, which allows us to identify priority issues for our stakeholders on which we manage risks and opportunities. Third, we identify the impact that each objective may have on our operation and the trends in these\n\n<!-- image -->\n\npriority services, and then we identify our ability to contribute to the resolution of the problems associated with the objectives, the role we play as a company, and the business opportunities that may arise. Finally, based on the connection between the business and the objectives, projects and strategies for contribution were defined. These steps allow us to connect, from the internal, how our mission, purpose and resources should respond to the external, that is, to the trends and challenges in the sustainability frontier that are aligned with our materiality and strategy, and that take into account the values and capabilities of the company.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Furthermore, we brought technology to the coffee ecosystem with 'Agropass,' in collaboration with the National Federation of Coffee Growers of Colombia. Through this, we demonstrated that it is possible to disperse resources in closed ecosystems with specific purposes.\n\nSimilarly, in 2023, we contributed to the reactivation of the real estate sector by leveraging our expertise to build 'MIA,' the first virtual real estate advisor implemented in Ciencuadras' sales channels. MIA manages and profiles customers over the phone and through WhatsApp to help them find their dream home. MIA is our first sales assistant with generative artificial intelligence.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThrough this technology, we also developed the first virtual assistant called 'Vivi.' With the advancements achieved through this initiative, we are the first bank in Colombia to implement a production-ready virtual assistant solution that provides services and customer support using generative artificial intelligence.\n\nFrom the sustainability front, we supported the environmental care strategy and the digital strategy, which is why 99.75% of financial and transaction statements (168 million) were delivered digitally for consultation, with only 0.25% delivered in paper format. Additionally, we reduced hardware obsolescence and migrated to the cloud, resulting in a reduction of 56.6 tons of CO2 annually, corresponding to the consumption of decommissioned servers, which has helped decrease our environmental footprint. Actions like these reflect our commitment to sustainability by minimizing resource waste and adopting more efficient and environmentally friendly technologies.\n\n## MIA\n\nThis year we developed the first real estate virtual assistant using generative artificial intelligence.",

To achieve this, we have segmented our market into two main groups: commercial and retail.\n\nIn the Retail segment, the main income-generating products are personal loans, credit cards, and savings and investment products. These products and services are designed to meet the financial and investment needs of our clients. Personal loans and credit cards have peaks in usage during the yearend season, while savings and investment products generate more stable income throughout the year.\n\n<!-- image -->",

These products and services are aimed at companies in various sectors of the economy, in order to help them finance their operations and manage their cash flows efficiently.\n\nRegarding seasonal income, it is important to note that some of the income may be related to the yearend season, when there is greater consumption and, therefore, greater demand for credit , while savings and investment products generate more stable revenues throughout the year. In addition, it is common that during certain months of the year, such as July and December, the flow of remittances received by customers increases, which translates into higher income from financial services. As for corporate banking, the tourism and foreign trade sector can also generate seasonal income, especially during periods of high demand, while treasury services generate more stable revenues.\n\nRegarding cyclical income in our bank, it is possible that it is linked to the country's economic situation. For example, during periods of economic growth, it is common for loan demand to increase, which translates into higher interest income. On the other hand, in times of economic uncertainty, clients may choose to save more and borrow less, which could reduce the bank's income. In addition, cyclical income may also\n\n## 21.8\n\n## MILLION CUSTOMERS\n\nWe increased our number of customers by 8.2% compared to the previous year.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nbe related to developments in capital markets and investment levels.\n\nFinally, regarding occasional income, it is important to mention that this can come from various sources, such as the sale of non-strategic assets or the recovery of bad loans. These revenues can occur at any time and are not subject to a specific period of the year or market fluctuations. The sale of non-strategic assets may be related to our asset management strategy, while the recovery of bad loans may be linked to the effectiveness of our debt recovery processes or specific decisions to sell written-off loans.\n\nBy year-end 2023, Banco Davivienda S.A. served 21.8 million customers, increasing 8.2% over the previous year.\n\nWe are proud to have achieved a solid customer base in both segments.

The balance of our commercial portfolio o in Colombia closed at COP 42.9 trillion 33 , representing 41.6% of our gross loan portfolio and a yearly decrease of 3.8%, due to a lower dynamic in the corporate and business segment, given the economic environment with high levels of inflation and interest rates, which decreased credit demand, as well as due to the perception of political uncertainty among business owners.\n\nAs of December 2023, our market share was 11.9% 34 , positioning us as the third largest bank in Colombia.\n\nOur support for businesses is aligned with our digital strategy, in which we are market leaders. In 2023, we launched the new Business App, with a design based on current market trends that allows our customers to\n\nhave everything in one place. Through the Business App, our clients can make quick inquiries, receive alerts and notifications, make multi-company profile changes, open new products, receive offers and special campaigns, have personalized attention, and other benefits. All of this has allowed us to become the key channel for companies to carry out regular and simple transactions, and to support entrepreneurs in managing their businesses from anywhere with a modern and easy-to-use experience.\n\n## CORPORATE AND BUSINESS SEGMENTS\n\nIn Colombia, our corporate portfolio closed with a balance of COP 23.4 trillion 35 , and the business segment with COP 3.8 trillion 36 . Together, they totaled COP 27.3 trillion, with a yearly decrease of 3.2%, as a result of lower credit appetite and demand, given the local economic and political environment.\n\n## INFRASTRUCTURE SEGMENT\n\nWe maintained our position as a key bank in the financing of infrastructure projects with significant impact on the development of Colombia, supporting road, port, energy generation and transmission, and real estate projects, among others, which contribute to the competitiveness and progress of the regions. We highlight the financing of 4G roads and private initiatives, ports, and energy projects.\n\nDue to their impact, all projects involve the participation of the Sustainability Directorate, where environmental, social, community, and governance issues are thoroughly reviewed. Additionally, these projects also go through good practice controls within the Environmental and Social Risk Management System (SARAS).\n\n## CONSTRUCTION SEGMENT\n\nOnce again, in 2023 we continued our leadership in the Construction segment in Colombia. Our portfolio balances closed with COP 6.8 trillion 37 ,\n\nrepresenting a growth of 13.5% compared to the previous year and 6.6% of our gross portfolio in the country.\n\nThe year 2023 was a significant challenge for the construction sector; the construction activity faced a situation in which no large infrastructure projects of national interest were developed, since public spending was mainly focused on social programs. Likewise, a sharp drop in mortgage sales pressured the sector's activity downward. In fact, compared to 2019, mortgage sales decreased by 20% and withdrawals increased by 32% 38 . Therefore, we supported our clients affected by this situation to meet their obligations.\n\nWe will continue to make efforts and reinforce policies, procedures, and capacity to continue offering banking and financial products aimed at sustainable construction.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 33 Individual figures limited to our operations in Colombia as of December 2023.\n- 34 Source: Financial Superintendence of Colombia.

To this end, three lines of defense have been defined involving the participation of all areas of the organization:\n\n## A\n\n- First line of defense: Business lines, operations and commercial. Business, commercial and operations functions that carry out the identification, evaluation, control and primary monitors of the risks to which they are exposed, taking as guidance the guidelines and policies issued by the areas of risk and compliance.\n- A Second line of defense: Risk areas, internal control and regulatory compliance. Promote and  protect the appropriate control scheme on risk management through independent monitoring of exposure levels, compliance with the levels of risk, capital and liquidity of appetite levels approved by the Board of Directors.\n- A Third line of defense: Internal and external audits. Independent evaluation of integrated risk management through the review of the effectiveness and efficiency of internal processes and controls.\n\nEmphasizing the management performed by the third line of defense within the risk management and control structure defined in Davivienda, it should be noted that both the Internal Audit and the External Audit (the latter in charge of the Statutory Auditor) periodically carry out independent evaluation processes of each of the specialized risk management systems and, in particular, the integrated risk management, seeking to assess the degree of effectiveness of risk management and identifying recommendations that contribute to compliance with such management. It has direct access to the Board of Directors and the Audit Committee, ensuring adequate follow-up and control of risk management compliance, in order to safeguard the solvency and reputation of the organization.\n\nIn 2023, the Internal Audit, in compliance with the Statute and Audit Policies, deployed the annual plan approved by the Audit Committee, based on the independent risk assessment. The audit work was executed reporting the findings and opportunities for\n\nimprovement on the different aspects of the Internal Control System (ICS) and risk management, with their respective action plans.\n\nFinally, the External Audit issues a consolidated concept on its independent evaluation of the integrated Risk Management, which is published in the Notes to the Bank's Financial Statements at year-end.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The results of these tests are used to identify risks and to define the appetite framework within which the business plan is developed.\n\nWithin the framework of the stress tests, the Stress Testing Scheme (STS) is developed under the guidelines of Chapter XXVIII of the Basic Accounting and Financial Circular. This scheme seeks to identify the vulnerabilities of the entities, enrich the decision-making process for risk management, examine the quantity and quality of their capital, liquidity, assets and liabilities according to their risk profile, as well as assess the viability of their business plans. In this way, the STS helps to strengthen risk management and complements the capital adequacy assessment\n\nprocesses. Based on the results of this exercise, the loss absorption capacity of the capital components is sized and adapted to the current and potential risks faced by the entity in the development of its business plan.\n\nThe Bank develops the STS in accordance with the timelines established by the Financial Superintendency of Colombia. The results obtained are evaluated throughout the year, becoming a reference point to follow up on the actual evolution of solvency ratios and other projected indicators, and thus evaluate possible future scenarios of the Bank to enrich risk management.\n\nIn 2023 the Bank conducted the STS assuming an environment of economic recession, high inflation, with slow growth, without reaching the target range of the Central Bank, high interest rates and unemployment. This environment causes a generalized\n\naffectation of the portfolio, especially the consumer portfolio. In addition, a cyber-attack is assumed to materialize. On the other hand, there are also adverse effects due to restrictions in access to local and international funding. The results are used for the development of preventive and corrective mitigating measures that broaden the Bank's action framework to face real stress scenarios.\n\n## RISK APPETITE FRAMEWORK\n\nFor Davivienda, it is essential to identify and evaluate the current and potential risks inherent to the activities carried out in the normal course of business for their proper management. The Risk Appetite Framework identifies those risks, and evaluates and defines whether they are assumed, mitigated, avoided or transferred.\n\n## STRESS TESTING FRAMEWORK\n\nour benchmark for evaluating future scenarios and enriching risk management.\n\nFrom Davivienda's taxonomy, the risks to which the entity is exposed in the development of its activities are classified into three main axes: Financial, non-financial and strategic risks. These risks are systematically evaluated through the entity's risk profile, which establishes a set of metrics that allow the Risk Committees and Board of Directors to actively monitor the risk appetite.\n\nThese risk metrics are delimited by specific zones that allow determining, through quantitative and qualitative\n\nanalysis, the entity's risk exposure level. These metrics are expressed in terms of capital, liquidity, volatility and profitability.\n\nDespite the great challenges of 2023 in the economic outlook, the anticipated and active management of risks allowed Davivienda to maintain capital and liquidity levels in accordance with the risk appetite, and maintains its active management focused on the credit quality of the loan portfolio and the operational risk associated with the Bank's activities.",

The scheme is based on four dimensions to measure the performance and execution of the strategic plan:\n\nService\n\nOn the other hand, governance was reformulated around strategy management, giving it attributes of flexibility and transversality, aligning it with the changing and adaptive nature of the strategy. This structure facilitated the systematic evaluation of strategic decisions by enabling top-down and bottom-up feedback schemes throughout the system.\n\nThe year 2023, being a challenging year in the economic environment with a scenario of high interest rates and inflation, required a timely follow-up of the behavior of our loan portfolio, defining this as one of the main strategic focuses. In the different committees and Board of Directors, a particular strategic followup was carried out in order to take the necessary corrective measures.\n\n## CREDIT RISK\n\nIts function is to comprehensively assess the strategic, technical and operational risk associated with the credit cycle. It also supports the management of transversal risks derived from the processes associated with the business (operational risks, fraud, technology, asset and liability management, compliance and internal control, as well as environmental, social and climate change risks).\n\nCredit risk is defined as the possibility that a borrower or counterparty does not comply with its obligations according to the agreed terms, negatively affecting the value of the Bank's loan portfolio. This risk is mitigated through the due diversification of portfolios in economic sectors and portfolio segments, the use of collaterals in some types of loans and through the parameters defined in the risk approval.\n\nThe objective of credit risk management is to maximize the bank's profitability, adjusting to the\n\ndesired risk levels. This objective is achieved by maintaining expected loss levels within acceptable parameters, without ignoring other uncertainty phenomena that may affect the result of the portfolio. Integral credit risk management also includes the strategic and operational risks associated with the credit cycle.\n\nCredit risk management is a logical and systematic process, which starting from the context of the processes associated with the credit cycle and the stages described above, allows identifying, analyzing, evaluating, controlling, monitoring and communicating the risks associated with the lines of business, products, services and markets where the Bank develops the credit business plan, seeking to obtain opportunities for improvement in the processes, as well as the prevention or mitigation of both credit and operating losses associated with the credit cycle.\n\nThe above implies a risk management cycle by stages as follows:",

These mechanisms refer to the policies, procedures and methodologies associated with the credit cycle: origination, deepening and recovery. It also includes the operational controls to ensure that they are duly implemented.

These changes have improved the behavior of recent vintages, generating a positive reconfiguration in client profiles towards medium-low risk levels, with less impact on their financial burden. However, the monthly results for the total consumer portfolio continue to be affected by the behavior of previous disbursements, taking into account their weight compared to recent disbursements.\n\nAs for the commercial portfolio, more pronounced deteriorations were observed at the end of the year, attributed to the\n\naforementioned macroeconomic factors. In order to efficiently address these situations, the corresponding areas have strengthened strategies, adjusting origination policies, followup and collection measures. Sectors such as residential construction, agriculture and livestock, trade, energy commercialization and health are the sectors with the highest level of deterioration within the commercial portfolio.\n\nWith respect to the International Subsidiaries, the gross loan portfolio presented a reduction of -14.2% expressed in pesos, and an increase of 8.0% seen in dollars. This differential behavior is explained by the appreciation of the peso against the dollar. In 2023 for Central America, there was a greater growth dynamic in the Consumer segment, especially in Payroll and Credit Cards. In the Commercial Banking segment, the Corporate segment presented the greatest dynamism. The subsidiary with the highest growth was Honduras, especially in the Retail Banking segment, followed by Costa Rica in the Commercial Banking segment.",

Challenging Economic Context\n\nIntegrated Risk Management includes the review of the risk management processes and the allocation of resources to ensure that emerging risks are correctly identified, assessed, and controlled from the strategic management to day-to-day processes at all levels of the organization.\n\nAt Davivienda we continually review the conditions of the environment in order to identify changes that may affect the objectives and the strategy of the business. We then implement the necessary adjustments to adapt to changes in our environment.\n\nBased on the organization's strategy and objectives, the Senior Management has identified 4 emerging risks that we have been monitored and controlled:\n\nIt is related to the risks and factors of economic uncertainty of a local or international nature that have an impact on macroeconomic variables in Colombia, including sudden increases in inflation, decrease in the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and clients' payment capacity. It also includes the effects of changes -mainly upwardin interest rates. International events usually have an impact on export revenues, the direction and amount of capital flows and remittances. Domestic events are usually related to sectoral deteriorations -such as the construction sector- that may end up affecting the stability of the financial sector, supply shocks that lead to drastic changes in inflation rates, interest rates and changes in risk premiums as a result of inadequate fiscal or macroeconomic management.\n\nAt the international level, for 2024, the low growth capacity of gross domestic product in most of the developed countries associated with the increase in international interest rates that took place between the end of 2022 and 2023 in order to stabilize the increase in inflation associated with Covid-19 stands out. These increases have had the effect of reducing demand particularly investment - and debtors' ability to pay, generating risks of low growth in economic activity. In the particular case of the United States, the increase in interest rates has affected the willingness to buy housing as well as greater restrictions on banks when granting loans. As a result of this phenomenon, there is a possibility, albeit moderate, that the banking deterioration could eventually affect the solvency of some financial institutions in that country.\n\nIn the case of local risks, for 2024 we focus on the two most important risks; risks associated with the performance of the construction sector and fiscal risks. The possibility of a significant adverse effect associated with the El Ni\u00f1o phenomenon also exists, but given the information available, it could cease to be relevant during the second half of the year.\n\n<!-- image -->",

    {
        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\nIn the construction sector, we observed a significant deterioration in both the building and civil works components. This situation has been caused by the confluence of several adverse factors including a significant increase in input costs, and a reduction in demand associated with the increase in interest rates as well as the lower availability of subsidies for the purchase of low-income housing. This situation has resulted in a deterioration of the financial health of the sector's entrepreneurs.  Fortunately,\n\nit is unlikely that the aforementioned events will have a considerable impact on the solvency of the financial sector or that they will have a repercussion on other sectors of the economy in such a way as to prevent economic recovery this year.\n\nRegarding fiscal risks, it is worth remembering that due to the effect of an increase in government expenditures associated with the pandemic -which was not accompanied by an increase in revenues- the country's fiscal position deteriorated significantly in 2021 with\n\nthe consequent loss of investment grade and increase in the country risk premium. The situation on this front has since improved thanks to compliance with the new fiscal rule, the increase in gasoline prices and the positive effects on revenue collection of the tax reform approved in 2022.\n\nHowever, some events may adversely affect this situation: in November 2023 the Constitutional Court declared unconstitutional paragraph 1 of Article 19 of Law 2277 of 2022 (Tax Reform), which prohibited the deduction of royalties from the taxable income tax base of oil companies. This means a hard blow in terms of revenues for the national government to the extent that this article generated an important percentage of the total expected collection. On the other hand, based on the Government's cash flow problems that would arise especially in 2025, the Government has been considering the possibility of making modifications to the fiscal rule, which could have adverse consequences in terms of debt increase.\n\nTo manage these risks, the Bank measures, monitors and controls the risk associated with the factors that could affect investments abroad, which includes analysis on the deterioration of macroeconomic, political and legal variables in different countries that are recipients of the Bank's investment. This analysis involves the participation of the Economic Studies, Corporate Credit and Legal areas of the Bank, which escalate the potential risk to the governing bodies, seeking to mitigate exposure to economic risks.\n\nIn addition, the Economic Studies department periodically analyzes international economic policy and reports to Senior Management and the Board of Directors on the main developments in the financial markets, as well as the local and international macroeconomic outlook, including projection models. Likewise, the risk committees and business areas continue to monitor the savings and payment behavior of our clients and the sectors in which they operate in order to generate the required action plans.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The offering of specialized, low-cost, 100% virtual services and products requires a profitable operation to achieve longterm sustainability. This 'cleaned-up' scenario continues to be an emerging risk, as it could mean the loss of clients, a decrease in revenues and a lower market share.\n\nHowever, Davivienda considers these competitors as an opportunity to consolidate its digital transformation through new business models taking advantage of new technologies\n\nsuch as artificial intelligence, open banking, blockchain and Big Data, to compete with a 100% mobile and personalized offering, but maintaining the proximity to customers through its network of offices and commercial force that ensures advice and support to customers in their life and business cycle.\n\nInnovation is an organizational skill that we have strengthened through a management model that accelerates innovation in the different strategies of Grupo Bol\u00edvar, consolidating highly disruptive and high-impact solutions that face these disruptive players.\n\nAn example of this is DaviPlata, consolidating itself as the 100% mobile digital wallet, open and one click away, which facilitates the daily life of our customers with top-up functionalities, utility payments, purchases with interoperable QR and POS, payment button, virtual card and Secure Online Payments (PSE). By the end of 2023, it has 17.4 million customers and covers 99% of the national territory.\n\nLikewise, Davivienda continues to ratify its position in Digital Banking in Colombia, becoming a Latin American benchmark with the most complete mobile offering in the country. Customers can acquire and manage savings, credit, investment, insurance and payment products through the new SuperApp, launched in 2023. With security and convenience in mind, Davivienda accelerated the processes to\n\ncontinue accompanying its customers with friendly and simple experiences in the most important moments of their lives.\n\n## 3. Risks associated with generative artificial intelligence\n\nThe adoption of generative artificial intelligence has been revolutionary in various fields such as art, design, and computational creativity. However, it carries some technological risks, especially in the creation of false or manipulated content, information leakage, and attacks on technological infrastructure. In contrast, it contributes to automation, source code development, original\n\ncontent, improved personalization of experiences, optimization of creative processes, and the generation of innovative solutions to complex problems.\n\nThese risks pose ethical, technological, legal, and security challenges that need to be addressed to ensure responsible use of the technology.\n\nTo mitigate technological and security risks, the Bank has\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nimplemented monitoring of the infrastructure deployed in the cloud and on-premise, ensuring service availability and identifying and remedying vulnerabilities.\n\nIn projects based on these technologies, such as virtual assistants, the Bank limits the scope of Artificial Intelligence search to the organization's ecosystem, authorized sources, and components, to prevent biased results from internet searches. Additionally, end users are subject to navigation controls and blocking the use of external artificial intelligences that may compromise the security of the Bank's ecosystem.\n\nIn summary, while generative artificial intelligence offers exciting innovations, it is crucial to address its technological risks through the implementation of regulations, promoting education, and advocating for ethical practices in its development and use.",

Risks associated with the use of technologies in digital ecosystems\n\nThe risk is related to the use of technology and the increasing connectivity between the technological infrastructure of companies and that of their Third Parties and Allies, accompanied by the expansion of ecosystems for the provision of digital services to customers, as well as the concentration of services in digital channels. The high connectivity and integration, which has accelerated exponentially, intensify the impact of failures in the availability of digital services, which can affect reputation and may result in regulatory sanctions.\n\nTo mitigate this risk, the organization has promoted the implementation of robust schemes for managing new threats and emerging risk vectors. In order to ensure the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of information, as well as the privacy of customer or user information, the effectiveness\n\nof control and security schemes is continuously evaluated, promptly incorporating necessary adjustments or controls.\n\nFurthermore, we have mitigated the risk of digital concentration through deployments in the cloud and various types of technological infrastructure.\n\nAdditionally, monitoring and control activities have been structured for the technologies provided by different cloud providers, both in terms of infrastructure and software, maintaining criteria for availability, performance, functionality, reliability, and regulatory compliance.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn addition, in response to the accelerated expansion of digital services, the Bank keeps its technological contingency and business continuity strategies up to\n\ndate, enabling multi-zone and multiregion services to address minor and catastrophic situations in the event of cloud failure. Services are deployed across different cloud providers, and in the event of infrastructure failures onpremise, there is a main Data Center located in Bogot\u00e1 and an Alternate Data Center in the city of Medell\u00edn, which allow us to recover technology services to ensure the provision of Bank services.\n\n## 5. Cyber conflict risk\n\nThis risk is caused by new and uncertain cyber attacks derived from the international context and the growing global, regional, and local political instability, which shape a new scenario of tensions that affect the dynamics of organizations. At the\n\nlocal level, we have seen an increase in this risk mainly due to internal conflicts and social protests, capable of creating scenarios of confusion, deception, and misinformation that can affect organizations, especially those that make up the critical cyber infrastructure of countries, including the Bank. The materialization of these types of attacks has serious consequences on operations, availability of computer systems, service channels, and unauthorized access to sensitive Bank information.\n\nLikewise, this cyber conflict risk can affect public or private sector entities that are commercially related to the Bank, exposing their data and financial assets to scenarios of unavailability, loss, or unauthorized transfers.\n\nThe Bank has strengthened its security mechanisms to mitigate the materialization of these types of attacks against our corporate clients.",

In this process, high-level control activities (key controls that ensure compliance with the strategy) and operational controls are carried out in all activities executed in the second line of defense function to ensure process continuity and minimize the materialization of losses resulting from process errors.\n\nIn addition, an annual assessment of the suitability and effectiveness of integrated risk management is conducted, with an optimal level of analysis to understand the risk management areas where we are strong and which require further work. These areas will be incorporated into the strategic planning of the second line of defense. The suitability assessment is carried out specifically for each specialized risk function\n\ndeveloped in the organization, aiming to understand the level of coverage, effectiveness of risk management, and alignment with Davivienda's strategic planning.\n\n## WE ARE ALL RISK CULTURE\n\nIn line with the business model of Grupo Bol\u00edvar and its prudent approach to risk management, guided by the appetite levels defined by the Board of Directors, the Risk Culture guideline is framed within Davivienda. This approach is directed by Senior Management in a cascading scheme that is socialized and applied by our employees, so that it reflects our behavior and best practices in risk management towards our customers, shareholders, and the general public, aiming to build and maintain long-term relationships.\n\nIn addition, the Code of Ethics of Grupo Bol\u00edvar, which is an integral part and a fundamental pillar to guide Davivienda's risk culture framework, aims, among other aspects, to increase trust and perceived value by\n\nemployees and stakeholders, and to be recognized for transparency in our management. This Code of Ethics is the guide that reflects the expected and unexpected behaviors present in our day-to-day activities, allowing us to be consistent and uphold our Principles and Values, in order to contribute to our higher purpose: Enriching lives with integrity.\n\nThese principles, values, and behaviors are reinforced by Grupo Bol\u00edvar through virtual training experiences for all employees, which seek to raise awareness of their responsibility and commitment to these guidelines.\n\nThese programs are complemented, within the framework of Risk Culture, with learning campaigns targeting the management bodies, regarding the best and new practices for risk management, as well as policy updates and regulatory changes, providing tools to understand how to act in the face of potential risks that impact the organization.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBoard members participate in specialized training programs on various risk management topics, allowing them to strengthen decision-making based on risk analysis in an environment of constant change. For 2023, the following topics are highlighted:\n\n## International Standards on Anti-Corruption Programs\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- A Guidelines on anti-bribery and anti-corruption programs based on International Laws against corrupt and antidemocratic actors.\n- A New guidelines for fiscal transfer programs.\n- A Business challenges in the face of new corruption practices.\n- A New types of corruption: abuse of power, acts against democracy, and organized crime from within state institutions.\n- A Responsibility laws to combat human rights violations.\n- A Guidelines that organizations must have in place for crisis management in cases of corruption.\n- A Overview of the modus operandi of criminal gangs in cyberspace.\n- A Strategic decision-making on cybersecurity management.\n- A New cybersecurity strategies to counter new threats and trends affecting the financial system.\n- A Cyber resilience in the financial sector against new threats.\n- A Success cases and key indicators for threat detection and enhancing organizations' response capabilities.\n\n## Cyber resilience as a challenge in organizations",

These, in addition to being short-term priorities, also incorporate strategies that, due to their size, mature in the medium and long term, but with concrete results and deliverables in the year. Incorporating longer-term strategic priorities within the variable compensation component allows for greater alignment between the expectations of shareholder groups and the decisions of senior management.",

This process will be gradually scaled up to cover 100% of our allies.\n- A Consolidate our vendor development program, helping them to segment, diagnose and identify gaps, and ensuring their firm adherence to our principles through awareness, training, development, and acknowledgement of their efforts.\n- A Inspire our supply chain to consolidate better sustainable practices, encouraging them to become leaders in this domain and sharing our DEI principles.\n\nUnder the scope of this program, we understand that it is important to recognize the efforts and results achieved by our vendors to become increasingly sustainable companies. Thus, for the third year in a row, we held the Inspira Awards . This year we honored our best suppliers in Colombia and Central America, drawing them closer to us so that they become our allies, inspiring them to achieve mutual growth, positively inspiring them and challenging them to achieve the extraordinary.\n\nOver 100 initiatives were nominated by vendors from Colombia, Honduras, El Salvador, Costa Rica, and Panama, allowing us to pinpoint the best projects that are making a difference under three categories: Digital Transformation, Process Efficiency and Sustainability.",

Participants learned about the latest trends and how procurement of goods and services is increasingly based on sustainability criteria.\n\nWe identified room for improvement in our current sustainable procurement process for prioritized goods. Therefore, we formulated a new evaluation methodology that enables us to identify goods and services acquired from our\n\nsuppliers across the board in the areas of Technology, Operations, Human and Administrative Talent, and International Subsidiaries procurement. This led to the prioritization of 45 categories classified by significant environmental impact to assess more purchases of goods and services based on environmental criteria.\n\nWe designed and structured 6 environmental fact sheets out of the 45 prioritized categories to evaluate the criteria we apply to vendors according to our materiality and environmental compliance\n\nBy year-end 2023, our sustainable procurement of prioritized goods for Colombia and Central America, based on this methodology, amounted to\n\nCOP 42.7 billion\n\nanalysis; this new methodology will be implemented gradually starting in 2024.\n\nOur priority in 2024 is to evaluate the goods and services of procurement specialties, setting specific performance goals for users and the supply chain with significant environmental impact. We monitor the procurement of goods and services and raise awareness among our vendors in an effort to better respond to new regulatory requirements and to replicate sustainability best practices throughout the supply chain.\n\nPurchase of equipment for employees amounting to\n\nCOP 10.8 billion\n\nAcquisition of RojoT\u00fa clothing collections for Colombia and Central America amounting to\n\nCOP 31.8 billion\n\n<!-- image -->",

Furthermore, we measured mental and emotional health, reaching 54% of the target population.\n\nThe following excelled as key findings from the above-mentioned studies:\n\n- A Overall and on-the-job psychosocial risk levels are low, which means that workers perceive that their work is a protective factor for their mental health.\n- A Our mental health survey revealed positive trends in the workplace, as 71.5% of the population reported a favorable attitude towards factors such as work dynamics, availability of resources, and positive impact on mental health.\n\nThese results reveal that our workforce has a favorable perception of our organization's efforts to promote mental and emotional health.",

Based on Gallup's global benchmark, average participation rate in engagement measurements for companies with\n\nover 100 people is 81%; this year more than 16,500 people participated in Davivienda's engagement survey (96% participation rate).\n\nCurrently, 68% of our population is engaged, 28% is somewhere in between, and 4% is actively disengaged, with a 17:1 engagement ratio, which means that for every 17 engaged people, there is 1 disengaged person; Gallup claims that\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nthe average ratio for companies with high engagement is roughly 13:1.\n\nThis figure varied by 0.06 compared to the last measurement carried out in 2022. Davivienda obtained an overall average of 4.37 out of 5, ranking in the 71st percentile on Gallup's global basis. This reflects that engagement is part of our personnel's core strategy.\n\nCurrently, over 50% of our teams score above this level of engagement. This is largely attributable to the action plans we have implemented, as we have listened to people's needs, and a key component of the organization's strategy is to clearly communicate the purpose of this measuring tool.\n\nConsequently, for the second year in a row we were acknowledged among 2,500 companies in Gallup's current global base, excelling as the only Latin American company to be awarded the 'Exceptional Place to Work' prize.\n\n## AN ADVENTURE TO GROW AND BE\n\nAs part of an effort to boost our initiatives through teamwork, the Personnel Recruitment and Talent Management Departments implemented the 'An adventure to grow and be' program, aimed at fostering and nurturing the potential of our associates by reinforcing their soft skills and their personal brand, reshaping their profiles, and becoming more attractive for recruitment processes.\n\nAs a result, in 2023, we evaluated 799 people through dynamic games, which helped us to measure our personnel's learning agility, strategic thinking, capacity to influence, adaptation to change and interest in growth, producing feedback that provided them with opportunities to further learn and grow.",

This item addresses governance factors, including the existence of an organizational structure in place with roles and responsibilities for the implementation of environmental and social programs.\n- A Efficient use of resources and prevention of pollution in accordance with technical standards and best industry practices.\n- A Land acquisition and involuntary physical and economic resettlement to improve the livelihoods of affected people.\n- A Participation processes and free, prior, and informed consent of ethnic communities (Indigenous, Black, Afro-Colombian, Raizal, Palenquero, and Rom or gypsy) affected by projects or activities.\n- A Biodiversity conservation and sustainable management of living natural resources, acknowledging actions aimed at protecting and conserving biodiversity, managing ecosystem services, and sustainably handling living natural resources.\n- A Labor and working conditions: To identify employment opportunities based on the protection of labor rights, fair treatment, and adequate working conditions in compliance with Occupational Health and Safety Systems, as well as non-discrimination and equal opportunities, and protection of the workforce against child labor and forced labor.\n- A Community health and safety to avoid or minimize risks and impacts on the health or safety of the communities where projects or activities are carried out.\n- A Protecting cultural heritage from adverse impacts caused by project activities.\n\nTo perform the environmental and social risk assessment, we request information about the project or activity to our clients, and then we use the methodology that enables us to identify the environmental and social risks, including climate risks. These insights are used to categorize environmental and social risks as A, B or C, ranging from greater to lesser potential environmental or social impact, respectively. We evaluate risks and potential impacts, legal compliance, external sources, and management measures (prevention, mitigation, offsetting). This leads to an environmental and social risk report, which determines technical feasibility and sets out action plans with follow-up and monitoring measures throughout the term of the loan, while also identifying opportunities. The environmental and social risk report is among the inputs that Credit Committees consider when making decisions. We include environmental and social clauses in loan agreements.\n\nCompliance with these commitments by the customer allows us to establish the level of environmental and social risk throughout the term of the loan, and in some instances, it is necessary to establish additional measures for the customer, which are reported as part of an ongoing relationship.\n\nSARAS is administered and managed by specialized, trained, and qualified internal officers who have experience in managing these risks and are members of the same organizational unit; SARAS is applied in conjunction with other credit cycle procedures with established roles and responsibilities for officers in the commercial, credit, credit risk, disbursement, and legal areas, among others.\n\nAs part of SARAS, we implemented training plans, both for the environmental and social technical staff in charge and for staff engaged in the sales, credit, disbursement, legal and other workflow components.",

In Colombia, we conducted 275 environmental and social risk assessments involving COP 9.1 trillion for projects and activities we finance for our clients in the Corporate, Construction, Business, and leasing operations segments. Additionally, we monitored 650 outstanding loans, thereby ensuring compliance with the commitments agreed with our clients, based on risk. 64% of the total number of Project Finance and housing construction projects financially evaluated were subject to environmental and social risk assessments. 340 of these projects were successfully financed, 47 were declined on financial grounds, and one was declined due to environmental issues. Additionally, we assessed 57 projects in Costa Rica, El Salvador, Honduras, and Panama valued at USD 406.4 million and continued monitoring 194 projects.\n\n## 275 EVALUATIONS\n\nof environmental risk, that correspond to COP 9.1 trillion.\n\nTo widen the scope of SARAS to clients in the Corporate and Business segments, as part of our Portfolio Rating and in collaboration with the Credit Risk area, we applied an Environmental and Social Survey for the second consecutive year, obtaining responses from 1,281 companies. This helped us to learn about our clients' initiatives and best practices in environmental and social matters. This survey was administered for the first time in the Construction segment. One hundred companies answered the survey for a total of 1,381 respondents. These are some of the results of the survey:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 43% (598) of companies\n\nbelong to or adhere to a benchmark or standard related to environmental, social or sustainability management, such as DJSI, TCFD, CDP, GRI, ISO 14001, Rainforest, or programs such as Acercar and Pread.\n\n## 77% (1,063) of companies\n\nidentify environmental and social impacts arising from their activities and implement management measures to control and mitigate such impacts.\n\n## 64% (886) of companies\n\nhave implemented activities aimed at efficiently using and utilizing natural resources for energy efficiency, circular economy, water reuse, separation, and delivery of solid waste to authorized waste managers, among others.\n\n## 14% (192) of companies\n\nmeasure and report their carbon footprint; 133 reported their total emissions in tons of CO2eq, the input we use to calculate financed emissions.\n\nWe expect to further strengthen this process by 2024 by optimizing our tools and raising awareness among our clients so as to improve the quality of the information received and to identify risks and opportunities for a broader scope of our portfolio.\n\nFurthermore, in 2023 we acquired more insights on how our clients operating in carbon-intensive sectors manage climate change. Accordingly, we continued improving the methodology used to evaluate and establish the Climate Change Maturity Level, which takes into account aspects such as carbon footprint measurement, greenhouse gas reduction strategies, identification and management of physical and transition risks, carbon neutrality or Net Zero goals, as well as engagement in trade associations initiatives.\n\nBased on these findings, we clustered our carbon-intensive clients from Incipient to Advanced level in climate change risk management.

The assessment integrates a review of exposure to climatic hazards such as landslides and floods. As a result, we identified 390 common projects covered by this evaluation, accounting for 18% of the Trust's business, mostly in the Real Estate product type.\n\nAdditionally, we monitored environmental and social risks of these projects to determine how they are performing in these realms.\n\n## SUSTAINABLE FUNDING\n\nAs a financer, we strive to mobilize resources to fund activities and projects that yield substantial environmental, social, and governance\n\nbenefits, and we pursue investment strategies underpinned by ESG criteria. This purpose is fulfilled under a shared value approach, encouraging, and developing business models capable of addressing recurring and key social and environmental problems in the countries we serve.\n\n## MULTILATERAL RESOURCES\n\nDavivienda Colombia and Davivienda Central America are committed to raising resources and diversifying capital under ESG criteria to fund new social and environmental projects. In 2023 we secured funding from the International Finance Corporation (IFC) and the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) destined to finance social projects, such as SMEs owned by women, SMEs, low-income housing, and low-income housing for women, as well as green loans to back projects centered on green building, energy efficiency, clean production, sustainable infrastructure, and agriculture.",

In addition, we have already begun to set intermediate targets for 2024 to 2029.\n\nWe have enhanced our technical capabilities to identify and declare our medium- and long-term targets, helping our business lines to seize new opportunities. This strategic focus, combined with solid human\n\nand technical resources, has led to the successful growth of our sustainable portfolio for both businesses and retail banking (green and social loans). In 2023, we reached a total amount of COP 17.2 trillion, a remarkable 19.4% year-onyear rise, accounting for 12.6% of our overall loan portfolio. It is worth noting that portfolio balances related to green financing or financing with environmental benefits reached COP 4.3 trillion in Colombia and USD 259 million in Central America.

In line with our corporate strategic objectives, we leverage technology and innovation to craft useful and\n\naffordable products and services to meet the needs of traditionally underserved groups.\n\nOur banking offerings have concentrated primarily on facilitating financial inclusion and access for women, young people, small and mediumsized enterprises, and the agricultural sector. Additionally, we have prioritized DaviPlata, a free savings product, as a cornerstone of our consolidation strategy. Under this umbrella, we built \"Ecosystems with Social Impact\", partnered with the national government to pay out both conditioned and nonconditioned money subsidies, and extended credit to unbanked persons and to individuals who lack access to financing, using nano credits.\n\n## INDIGENOUS POPULATION OF THE ZEN\u00da COMMUNITY\n\nWe onboarded\n\n13,710 customers who sell handmade products, mainly 'Sombreros Vueltiaos' to DaviPlata, as part of an effort to boost their sales and to help them engage in digital transactions.\n\n## WE LAUNCHED 'YOUNG PEOPLE +14'\n\nA program aimed at connecting young people between 14 and 17 years of age to DaviPlata. We conducted\n\n## on-site campaigns in 36 schools and 5 universities nationwide,\n\noffering financial education, support for entrepreneurship and hands-on activities to connect them to the financial system.\n\nDIGITAL TAKEUP WITHIN A FINANCIAL ECOSYSTEM FOR THE SAN ANDRES PROVIDENCIA AND SANTA CATALINA ISLANDS\n\nThere are 5,366 stores on the island using DaviPlata, 37% of which already feature QR capabilities, enabling tourists and locals to make cashless purchases.\n\nWe increased the number of customers in the Islands by 8% in 5 months, and 50% of them are active and conducting transactions digitally.\n\nDaviPlata's Main Financial Inclusion Results\n\n## RURAL POPULATIONS\n\nDaviPlata's footprint stretches across 665 of the 691 municipalities in Colombia classified by Finagro as rural municipalities, that is, 96% of them.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## ARTISANS\n\nWe promote Colombian arts and crafts culture through banking, digitalization, personalized, virtual, and face-to-face financial education workshops, and sponsorships for participation in local and national events, where artisans are able to market their\n\nproducts. 64% of our 23.8 thousand artisans are women.",

Consequently, we have integrated social marketing strategies aimed at bridging social gaps and\n\ncontribute to the eradication of poverty, by conveying key messages towards financial consumers (customers and non-customers, companies, and entrepreneurs) to raise awareness about the risks and opportunities entailed with each decision made when managing money, to help them (whether they are adults, young people, teenagers, or children) achieve financial well-being.\n\nAdditionally, understanding the context and new teaching trends, such as micro-learning, and the focus on behavioral biases, Banco Davivienda's Financial Education program has boosted its digital and face-to-face ecosystem composed of 32 micro-courses on investment, entrepreneurship, and personal and family finance. Throughout 2023,\n\n42,675 people completed these lessons, learning objects, rating them with 89% satisfaction and 81% usefulness.\n\nOur focus in 2023 was placed on strengthening the path to financial well-being for customers and non-customers, mainly targeting population groups that do not usually have a direct relationship with the financial system or who are in stages of life in which knowledge and good habits are key to their future.\n\nFinancial consumers, i.e. customers and non-customers, were the starting point of our strategy. 'My Finances at Home', available as web version and through social media, provides recommendations for sound financial decision-making, featuring innovative formats focused on engaging our customers with close and authentic communication.

Therefore, we rolled out the Green Mission 2030 strategy, which aims to implement best market practices to foster a culture of eco-efficiency and sustainability to mitigate climate change and ecosystem degradation. Through the transfer of knowledge between Colombia and Central America, we seek to promote the efficient use of natural resources and position ourselves as a benchmark Multi-Latin Bank in terms of sustainability.\n\nWithin Mission Green 2030, we have focused our efforts on three key pathways:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOperational eco-efficiency: we seek to reduce the consumption of natural resources such as water and energy, and in turn reduce our carbon emissions.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur circular economy approach challenges us to implement strategies to reduce, reuse, and recover the waste generated in our operation.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSustainable sourcing becomes relevant as we seek to strengthen our value chain through supplier development processes and sustainable procurement.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur commitment to environmental sustainability has been reflected in important recognitions. In 2023, we received carbon neutrality certification 56 from the Colombian Institute of Technical Standards and Certification (ICONTEC), under the Greenhouse Gas protocol (GHG protocol), as well as the recertification of the renewable energy seal 57 for our entire corporate in Colombia and for the first time in Central America.\n\nWe have obtained these certifications through the estimation of the emissions inventory and its prior verification. Similarly, we carry out offsetting actions, such as the planting of trees of native species and the acquisition of renewable energy certificates, contributing responsible environmental protection.\n\nWe defined 2022 as our baseline period, to then set reduction plans and strategies focused on the prevention, control and mitigation of the environmental impacts generated by the greenhouse gasses of our operation. Additionally, in 2023 we were awarded the recognition as a true green organization granted\n\nby CO2CERO, which ratifies our commitment to climate action.\n\nThese achievements are the result of the commitment of all areas of the Bank and subsidiaries in Central America, who have worked together to implement environmental initiatives and strategies that lead us to contribute to sustainable development.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 56 Certification period 2022 - 2025\n- 57 Certification Period 2022",

We continued to strengthen the quantification of our carbon emissions inventory and implemented reduction and offsetting strategies.\n\nStarting in 2022, we expanded the quantification of our indirect emissions (Scope 3) in several categories, such as: goods and services purchased, capital goods, upstream transportation and distribution, waste generated in operation, and business travel in accordance with the methodological guidelines of the Greenhouse Gas Protocol (GHG Protocol).\n\n## Variation in emissions operation - Banco Davivienda and it subsidiaries\n\n(ton CO2e, except percentages)\n\n|                                                                                                                        | Indicator (ton CO2eq)   | 2023     | 2022   | 2021   | 2020   | 2019    | Variations  2023-2022   | Variations  2023-2019       |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|----------|--------|--------|--------|---------|-------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| Emissions from refrigerant gas consumption for air conditioners,  power plant fuels and fire extinguishers (ton CO2eq) | 3,753                   | 3,917    | 4,413  | 4,316  |        | 4,675   | - 4.19% -19.72%         | Scope 1                     |\n| Emissions from electricity consumption  location based                                                                 | 6,359                   | 7, 0 3 0 | 6,761  | 12,443 | 14,587 | -9.54%  | -56.41%                 | Scope 2                     |\n| Emissions from electricity consumption  market based                                                                   | 414                     | 422      | 506    | 839    |        | 0       | -1.90% -                | Scope 2                     |\n| Emissions from electricity consumption  location based                                                                 | 10,112                  | 10,947   | 11,174 | 16,759 | 19,261 | -7. 63% | - 47. 50 %              |                             |\n| Emissions from electricity consumption  market based                                                                   | 4,167                   | 4,339    | 4,919  | 5,155  | 4,675  | -3.96%  | -10.87%                 |                             |\n| Other indirect emissions                                                                                               | 2,278                   | 5,096    | 282    | 430    | 1,561  | -55.30% | 45.93%                  | Scope 3*                    |\n| Total inventory of  location based  GHG emissions                                                                      | 12,390                  | 16,043   | 11,456 | 17,189 | 20,822 | -22.77% | -40.50%                 | Total GHG                   |\n| Total inventory of  market based  GHG emissions                                                                        | 6,445                   | 9,435    | 5,201  | 5,585  | 6,236  | -31.69% | 3.35%                   | Emissions  Inventory        |\n| Total inventory of  location based  GHG emissions (ton CO2e/FTE)                                                       | 1.07                    | 1.24     | 0.81   | 0.89   | 0.94   | -13.58% | 14.42%                  | Total inventory  of FTE GHG |\n| Total inventory of  market based  GHG emissions (ton CO2e/FTE)                                                         | 0.56                    | 0.73     | 0.37   | 0.29   | 0.28   | -23.56% | 98.73%                  | emissions                   |\n| Total inventory of  location based  GHG emissions (ton CO2e/m 2 )                                                      | 1.72                    | 2.19     | 1.35   | 1.54   | 1.98   | -21.84% | -13.35%                 | Total inventory  of GHG     |\n| Total inventory of  market based  GHG emissions (ton CO2e/m 2 )                                                        | 0.89                    | 1.29     | 0.61   | 0.50   | 0.59   | -30.87% | 50.50%                  | emissions m 2               |\n\n- * From 2022 onwards, the quantification of indirect emissions will be extended.\n\n<!-- image -->",

These offsetting efforts were possible through our participation in various projects that promote reforestation, deforestation prevention, and renewable energy generation. These are some of the projects:\n\n## A Vichada CO2Cero Forestry Project,\n\nlocated in the municipality of Puerto Carre\u00f1o, Department of Vichada. Tree species such as Acacia, Eucalyptus, Rubber and Pine are used in this project.\n\n## A PEACEcific REDD+ Project,\n\n- located in the north of the department of Nari\u00f1o and in the west of the department of Cauca, specifically in the municipalities of Mag\u00fc\u00ed and Santa B\u00e1rbara. This project covers a total area of 288,170 hectares, including 273,718 hectares (94.98%) of stable forest over time.\n- A Hidrobarrancas and La Rebusca run-of-the-river hydroelectric power plants, located in the department of Antioquia. These plants take advantage of the water needed to generate energy, allowing the rest to flow back into the river, which helps to reduce the environmental and social impacts caused by large reservoirs.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThese projects not only contribute to offsetting our emissions, but also promote biodiversity conservation and clean energy generation.",

Thus, in 2024 we will work under this methodology to establish goals with significant impact that contribute to the fulfillment of the sustainable development goals and reinforce our commitment to climate action in the short, medium, and long term.\n\n## We are committed to responsible consumption and energy saving!\n\nIn 2023, our energy consumption amounted to 27,516 MWh, a 22% reduction compared to 2019 and a 3% increase compared to 2022. This increase is mainly attributable to remodeling works at our headquarters, an increase in the number of ATMs and greater presence at our facilities. Despite these factors, our consumption is still 19.88% lower than the average consumption established by the Colombian Chamber of Construction (CAMACOL) 58 for offices where, depending on the climate, an average energy consumption is established for the country.\n\nThat is why we will continue to work on the implementation of several energy efficiency strategies. Currently, we leverage more than 4,300 bots in our specialized utility management program which facilitate the analysis, digitization, and audit of more than 23,800 invoices. We also continuously monitor our electricity\n\nconsumption, identifying trends and atypical consumption at each of our sites in order to make relevant decisions and measures.\n\nOn the other hand, we updated our electrical standard under the guidelines of ISO 50001:2018; We focus on the analysis, electricity consumption profile, operation curves and implement a model which allows the optimization in the use of electromechanical equipment and energy consumption adjusted to our operating schedules. This strategy has a savings projection of 8% per office. This update will allow us to integrate the BMS (Building Manager System) system with the ability to respond to early warnings in consumption and electrical failures, guaranteeing the continuity of operation and the comfort of our associates and customers.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 58 https://ismd.com.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Anexo-No-1-Gu%C3%ADa-de-contrucci%C3%B3nsostenible-para-el-ahorro-de-agua-y-energ%C3%ADa-en-las-edificaciones.pdf",

These efforts not only reinforce our commitment to environmental and social sustainability, but also contribute to the creation of shared value for all stakeholders involved in our value chain.\n\nThe significant progress made through our Green Mission 2030, specifically with regard to strengthening our value chain through sustainable supplier development and procurement processes, was comprehensively addressed in the value chain management section, where we identified key opportunities to improve the resilience and efficiency of our operations.\n\nIn recent years, we have replicated good environmental practices in each of the countries we serve, seeking to ensure that they are cross-cutting and contribute to our vision of being a Multi-Latin Bank that leaves a positive environmental footprint to drive the change that the planet needs.\n\n## HONDURAS\n\nAs part of our commitment to sustainability and our Green Mission 2030 strategy, we implemented ecoefficiency measures in Honduras at our facilities in 2023, which resulted in significant reductions.\n\nWe renovated 42 air conditioning units, changing from R22 to R410 in agencies distributed throughout the country. This enabled us to reduce refrigerant consumption by approximately 45% compared to the previous year.\n\nIn addition, we continued switching from luminaires to LED technology in agencies and corporate buildings. So far, we have implemented this change across 6 agencies, resulting in an approximate 23% reduction in energy consumption.\n\nOn the other hand, in 2023 we managed to certify 56 environmental leaders and managers through our Good Multipliers program, as part of our commitment to comprehensive environmental education for all our employees.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## SHARED VALUE\n\nWe adopt and promote responsible practices in our supply chain that generate shared value for everyone.\n\n<!-- image -->",

At the end of the year, we had 3 elevators in operation out of a total of 4, which allow an electrical energy saving of approximately 30% compared to the old elevators. In addition, we completed the installation of 3 new photovoltaic plants, with a total capacity of 165 kWp, estimating an average clean energy generation of 246 MWh per year.\n\nWe have reinforced our focus on environmental training for our employees, enabling 145 employees in El Salvador to successfully complete the Multipliers of Good program, becoming environmental leaders and managers.\n\nIn 2024, we will begin the readaptation of 4 of the 7 levels of the Financial Center, which will include the installation of more than 300 energy-saving LED lamps, with the aim of significantly reducing electricity consumption.  In addition, we have begun to replace windows with thermoacoustic models, which will allow a more efficient use of air conditioning and, therefore, a lower demand for energy. We also continue to work on obtaining LEED certification in Operation and Maintenance 4.1 for the Zona Rosa and Miralvalle agencies.\n\n<!-- image -->",

We are aligned with the Green Mission 2030 strategy, as we have implemented measures to quantify and manage the consumption of water, energy, paper, greenhouse gas emissions and waste management in our operation, in collaboration with our strategic suppliers.\n\nWe've significantly improved preventative maintenance, including air conditioners, lighting fixtures, and faucets, with comprehensive monitoring through the Asana Tool, leading to a 45% reduction in incidents through reinforcements of building and branch visits.\n\nWe continue with the process of changing air conditioners for R410 models, improving efficiency in spaces and allowing digital control of temperatures, to avoid improper manipulation.\n\nIn terms of transportation, we operate a route from downtown (San Jos\u00e9) to our corporate offices located in Torre, Escaz\u00fa, also encouraging car sharing among employees to reduce the inventory of GHG emissions.\n\nIn addition, we have implemented a digital tracking system in the Bank's fleet of vehicles to monitor fuel consumption, vehicle conditions, as we offer recommendations to drivers in real time, which has allowed us to achieve savings of 18%, compared to 2022.\n\nFinally, in Costa Rica, we have trained 702 employees through the Multipliers of Good program, turning them into environmental leaders and managers with knowledge in energy and water efficiency.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

An outstanding achievement was the certification of 34 employees as environmental leaders and managers after completing the Multipliers of Good program. These leaders are trained in energy and water efficiency, both in\n\nour facilities and in their homes.\n\nBy 2024, we will continue our commitment to reducing our GHG emissions inventory through projects that include strategies to optimize the number of luminaires, implementation of the waste management plan, and the replacement of CO2 fire extinguishers, a process that is already underway. These projects, along with other initiatives that may arise, reflect our ongoing effort to reduce our emissions and consumption.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Davivienda Panam\u00e1 GHG Emissions, Operational Eco-efficiency and Circular Economy Results 2023\n\n|                                           | 2023    | 2022   | 2021    | 2020   | 2019    | Variation  2023-2022   | Variation  2023-2019                                                                                                  | Comentarios                                                                                                  |\n|-------------------------------------------|---------|--------|---------|--------|---------|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Scope 1 (ton CO2e)                        | 110     | 79 65  |         | 96     | 39.32%  |                        | 15.86% Through the project to change LED                                                                              | 95                                                                                                           |\n| Scope 2 (ton CO2e)                        | 67      | 67     | 71      | 176    | -1.10%  | -68.55%                | 15.86% Through the project to change LED                                                                              | In 2023, there was a 20% increase in Scope  212                                                              |\n| Scope 3 (ton CO2e)                        | 37 12   | 3      | 1       | 2      | 203.04% | 2205.00%               | 15.86% Through the project to change LED                                                                              | Tons of CO2e, mainly due to the increase in                                                                  |\n| Total GHG Emissions  Inventory(your CO2e) | 213 158 | 139    | 273     | 308    | 34.72%  | -30.76%                | 15.86% Through the project to change LED                                                                              |                                                                                                              |\n| Energy (MW)                               | 646 653 | 694    | 636     | 764    | -1.10%  | -15.43%                | luminaires in our branches, we reduced  energy consumption by 15.43% compared to  2019 and by 1.10% compared to 2022. | 0.1 -2.54% 40.77% 1.7 4.17% -56.27% We achieved a reduction in paper  consumption by 56.27% compared to 2019 |\n| Energy (MW/FTE)                           | 3.2 3.5 | 3.9    | 3.3     | 6.0    | -8.97%  | - 47. 26%              | luminaires in our branches, we reduced  energy consumption by 15.43% compared to  2019 and by 1.10% compared to 2022. |                                                                                                              |\n| Energy (MW/m 2 )                          | 0.1 0.1 | 0.2    | 0.2     |        |         |                        | luminaires in our branches, we reduced  energy consumption by 15.43% compared to  2019 and by 1.10% compared to 2022. |                                                                                                              |\n| Paper consumption (Ton)                   | 0.8 0.7 | 0.6    | 0.6     |        |         |                        |                                                                                                                       |                                                                                                              |\n|                                           | 3.7     | 3.8    | 3.7 2.9 | 10.7   | - 4.12% | -65.68%                |                                                                                                                       | full-time employees in our subsidiary.

These challenges pose significant risks to economic and financial stability, but also offer opportunities for innovation and investment in nature-based solutions.\n\nBy addressing these issues in a proactive and integrated way, we not only protect the planet and its ecosystems, but also build a legacy of resilience, trust, well-being, and prosperity for individuals, families, and businesses.\n\nDavivienda strives daily to make the world, our home, a more prosperous, inclusive, and green home. Our mission\n\nis to support our business lines and our customers with an innovative offering that not only yields financial benefits, but also supports the restoration and preservation of our natural capital.\n\nOur commitment, beyond an ethical duty, is a smart strategy for longterm success in the financial world powered by the adoption of novel financial services solutions that promote the regeneration of the planet.\n\nIn line with this commitment, the G-Zero Colombia Card has been designed with the aim of generating a positive impact on the environment. Made from recycled plastic, it offers customers the opportunity to donate the cashback received to environmental initiatives\n\nthrough organizations such as WWF Colombia (World Wildlife Fund). More than 53000 of these cards were active in 2023.\n\nIn addition, Davivienda rigorously applies the environmental and social risk assessment methodology to loan applications submitted by our business clients. This methodology is based on the IFC Performance Standards (IFC PS), Specifically, Performance Standard 6 recognizes that the protection and conservation of biodiversity, the maintenance of ecosystem services, and the sustainable management of living natural resources are fundamental to sustainable development.",

Consequently, in 2023\n\nwe started a diagnosis using the ENCORE (Exploring Natural Capital Opportunities, Risks and Exposure) tool for 270 projects evaluated under SARAS. These were housing construction projects and other projects in: mining and coal, industrial, energy and engineering and civil works.\n\nOur main findings identified that most projects depend on groundwater or surface water as the main physical input, as well as depend on water filtration for mitigation of direct impacts, protection against interruptions such as stabilization of mass movements and erosion control, and protection against floods and storms. In this regard, we identified\n\nthat the three main drivers of impacts to biodiversity are water pollution, greenhouse gas emissions, and soil pollutants.\n\nFor the Bank, it is important to consider the interconnections between climate change and biodiversity loss in order to manage the associated risks, and for joint disclosure purposes. That is why, in 2024, we will challenge ourselves to expand the diagnosis to other activities in our loan portfolio, better identifying these factors and integrating this data with the various areas involved to raise awareness, manage, and identify opportunities to leverage projects with benefits for biodiversity as well as to promote\n\ninstruments that allow the generation of new products with a positive impact on ecosystems and species. As such, we will move forward within the Bank in alignment with the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD) framework.\n\nIt is not only in Colombia that we have contributed with our sustainable portfolio. In Central America, we boast two green products that are contributing in an integral way to the biodiversity of the countries we serve: the Davivienda Green Accounts (El Salvador and Panama) and the Davivienda Seguros green insurance (Honduras, El Salvador, Costa Rica).\n\nGreen insurance, with more than 13 years of experience, is the only one in Central America where the client directly supports the conservation\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nof biodiversity and the mitigation of climate change. With each policy issued, the insured contributes to the restoration of mangrove ecosystems.\n\nHonduras\n\nGreen insurance was launched in July 2022 with more than 3,626 policies placed, contributing to the restoration of 3 hectares of mangrove forest.\n\nEl Salvador\n\nWe have more than 22,000 active policies with a 59% share in mass insurance placements. Thanks to this, in the last 5 years the insured contributes 1% of the insurance premium for the restoration of 6.2 hectares of mangroves.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGreen insurance was launched in 2023 with more than 3,725 policies placed, contributing to the restoration and monitoring of 10 hectares of mangroves in a protected area.\n\nGreen Accounts in Central America:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe client contributes to a sea turtle conservation program. Over the past 14 years, more than 1.5 million hatchlings of this species have been released.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe are developing a product to enable our customers to directly support a program that seeks to plant\n\n10,000 coral fragments for reef restoration just by opening a mobile account.",

At the beginning of the year, the World Bank anticipated a 1.7% annual expansion, but the growth estimate later increased to 2.4% 62 . Developed economies registered better-than-expected growth. The United States, Russia and China stood out due to their good performance; in the latter, the opening of the economy compared to the strict confinement policies implemented until 2022 to combat covid-19, as well as an expansionary fiscal policy, contributed to results above expectations.\n\nIn addition, Latin America also experienced an upward correction in growth: the projected 1.3% figure at the beginning of the year rose to an estimated 2.2% by the end of the year. The better-than-expected results were linked to moderation in inflation and declines in monetary policy rates in some countries, especially emerging ones. Favorable conditions in Latin America were tied to improved harvests, moderation in oil prices and the robust performance of the United States' economy, particularly benefiting Mexico and Central American countries.\n\nIt is crucial to note that, even though global growth exceeded initial estimates, it remained subdued compared to historical averages for this\n\ncentury. This was primarily attributed to the withdrawal of fiscal stimuli and high interest rates put in place to curb inflation.\n\nThe average price of oil saw a significant reduction in 2023 compared to the price observed in the previous year. In fact, Brent crude oil's price averaged USD 98.75 per barrel in 2022 and dropped to USD 82.2 per barrel in 2023. The year-end quotation settled at USD 77.60 per barrel compared to USD 84.97 per barrel at the end of 2022. The decline in oil prices was influenced by various factors, including modest global growth, increased production in countries like the United States, Brazil and Guyana as well as a substantial\n\n- 61 Document prepared by the Executive Directorate of Economic Studies with information available as of January 18, 2024.\n- 62 See the World Bank's global economic perspectives, January 2023.",

The price drop would have been more significant without Saudi Arabia's policy of production cuts.\n\nIn Colombia, growth results in 2023 were modest, with an estimated 0.6% annual GDP increase. This situation occurred as the economy was affected by several factors, including:\n\n- A A low global economic growth.\n- A The increase in international and local interest rates resulting from restrictive monetary policy to control inflation.\n- A The reduction of the fiscal impulse (deficit) in order to comply with the fiscal rule.\n- A The rise in certain key relative prices in the economy (such as the price of new and second-hand housing properties) that slowed the growth of some sectors.\n- A A significant decline in investment as a result of high exchange rate levels in the second half of 2022, an increase in interest rates and the uncertainty generated by the policies of the new government.\n\n## GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT\n\nAccording to figures from DANE, the Colombian GDP grew by 0.6% in 2023, showing a significant moderation compared to the 7.3% observed in 2022. This is supported by a favorable annual growth figure during the first quarter (2.9%), while in the second quarter the variation was almost null (0.1%). In the third quarter of the year, GDP contracted by 0.6%, and in the last quarter, annual growth was only 0.3%.\n\nFrom the perspective of economic activities, during 2023, the most dynamic sector was 'financial and insurance activities' with a 7.9% growth, followed by 'artistic, entertainment, recreational, and other service activities' with a 7.0% growth and the 'public administration, defense, health, education, and compulsory affiliation social security plans' with a 3.9% growth.\n\nOn the other hand, the sectors with the worst performance in 2023 were construction (-4.2%), manufacturing industries (-3.5%) and commerce, which includes vehicle repair, transportation, storage, accommodation and food services (-2.8%).\n\nThe analysis from the components of aggregate demand indicates that domestic final demand contracted by 3.8% in real terms during 2023. Household consumption grew by 1.1%, government spending increased by 0.9% and gross capital formation fell by 24.8% (even lower than the observed figure in 2020, when it fell by -20.7% due to the pandemic).\n\nVariables related to the external sector contributed to mitigating the macroeconomic imbalance that the Colombian economy has been experiencing; indeed, exports grew by 3.1% in the period mentioned, while imports fell by 14.7%.\n\n## Colombia - Gross Domestic Product\n\n(Annual percent change)\n\n13.8%\n\n10.8%\n\nQ4\n\nQ3\n\n2021 quarters\n\n8.2%\n\nQ1\n\n12.2%\n\nQ2\n\n7.4%\n\nQ3\n\nQ4\n\nQ1\n\n2022 quarters\n\n2.1%\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2.9%\n\n0.1%\n\nQ2\n\nQ3\n\nQ4\n\n2023 quarters\n\n0.3%\n\n-0.6%",

Housing costs and public utilities payments contributed to about one-third of the total annual inflation; indeed, rent indexation to the 2022 inflation and growing concerns about the El Ni\u00f1o phenomenon drove up rents and electricity rates, respectively. On the other hand, there was strong pressure in transportation due\n\nto increases in gasoline prices, making this category the second division with the highest contribution to inflation. Likewise, dining out activities were impacted by higher operating costs such as rent, electricity and some food items that did not decrease in price, such as meats, leading the restaurants and hotels activities to become the third-largest inflationary factor for the entire year.",

This effect was quite noticeable in the prices of both new and used vehicles, vehicle parts, some household appliances and technological devices, among other goods.\n\nThe increase in the monthly minimum wage for 2024 was set by decree by the national government at 12.07%, amounting to COP 1,300,000 (COP 1,462,000 with transportation allowance). Therefore, the minimum wage increase was 2.79% above the total annual inflation of 2023.\n\n## MONETARY POLICY AND INTEREST RATE\n\nDuring 2023, the Central Bank accelerated the monetary normalization cycle that had started in September 2021. The monetary policy rate was increased three times during the year, reaching a level of 13.25% in the April meeting, 125 basis points higher than at the end of 2022. Thus, the monetary policy rate reached levels not seen since November 1999.\n\nAfter this decision, the Bank kept the monetary policy rate unchanged for eight consecutive months until it was cut by 25 basis points in the December meeting.\n\nIn Colombia, the movements in monetary policy were mainly driven by the following reasons:\n\n- A Inflation showed a slow decline throughout the year, remaining well above the Central Bank's target range.\n- A Medium- and long-term inflation expectations remained elevated for a large part of the year.\n- A Economic activity showed a weaker performance, reflecting the stance of monetary policy.\n- A Developed economies maintained stability in their interest rates, allowing for a slight easing in the country's external financial conditions.\n\n## PESO APPRECIATION\n\nIn 2023, the Colombian peso appreciated sharply against the dollar, which contributed to the deceleration of annual inflation.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Colombia - Interest rates 2023\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSource: Banco de la Rep\u00fablica.\n\ny\n\nr\n\nu\n\nUs",

They then started a downward trend in the final part of 2023, reaching a level of 12.7% in the last week of the year, a rate that is 100 basis points lower than the observed rate at the end of 2022. Part of the volatility in the second and third quarters of the year was associated with liquidity constraints, largely explained by the high balances in the Nation's deposits at the Central Bank 64 . In turn, in the final part of the year, there was less pressure derived from the regulatory adjustments made by the Financial Superintendence of Colombia (SFC) to the Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) 65 .\n\nFinally, the cap rate closed 2023 at 37.56%, showing a reduction of 3.9 percentage points compared to the level at the end of 2022, and 9.5 percentage points compared to the peak observed in April (47.09%). These reductions were largely associated with the methodological change 66 in the calculation of the current bank interest rate, which represents a reduction in interest rates, especially for consumer loans including credit cards.\n\n## FISCAL POLICY\n\nIn fiscal matters, preliminary figures indicate that during 2023 the national government's net debt reached 52.8% of GDP and managed to comply with the fiscal rule. Government revenues amounted to COP 296.3 trillion, a figure that shows a decrease of COP 12.8 trillion compared to the estimate presented in the Medium-Term Fiscal Framework (MTFF) last year. This decline was driven by lower revenues from tax collection (COP 10.9 trillion) as well as lower capital surpluses (COP 2.4 trillion). As for expenses, they amounted to COP 363.3 trillion and turned out to be lower than the initial estimate of COP 378.6 trillion, thanks to\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## COMPLIANCE\n\nThe central government's net debt represented 52.8% of GDP and complied with the fiscal rule.\n\nlower resources allocated to interest payments (COP 8.1 trillion) and primary spending (COP -7.1 trillion). The lower level of expenses managed to offset the decline in revenues, allowing the national government's deficit to reach 4.2% of GDP, a figure very close to the target of 4.3% of GDP set in the MTFF and consistent with compliance with the fiscal rule.\n\n- 63 Fixed Term Deposit Rate, for its Spanish acronym, is the weighted average of the effective 90-day deposit rates recognized by the financial system to its customers.\n- 64 During the second and third quarters of the year, the balance of the Nation's deposits at the Central Bank recorded an average close to COP 40 trillion, higher than the historical average of COP 20 trillion, representing a larger amount of resources that were not injected into the national economy during those periods. For the fourth quarter, the average balance decreased to COP 30 trillion.\n- 65 In September, the Financial Superintendence of Colombia changed the weights of the Available Stable Funding (ASF) of the NSFR for deposits from Supervised Entities and Collective Investment Funds. The regulation states that the weight for these deposits changed from 0% to 25% starting on September 30, 2023, and will be in effect until August 31, 2025. From that moment on, deposits will have a weight of 0% or 50% depending on whether they are non-operational or operational, respectively.\n- 66 The Financial Superintendence of Colombia modified the methodology for calculating the current bank interest rate, which changed from being calculated as the simple average of the weighted rates for consumer loans, credit cards, and ordinary loans to being calculated as the weighted average of these rates.",

This decline was driven by the decrease in the value of sales of the country's main export products: coffee (-29.5%), coal and coke (-25.4%) and oil and derivatives (-16.6%). Exports of manufactured goods also deteriorated during this period, showing a 3.8% decrease as a result of lower external sales of primary plastics (-31.4%) and iron and steel (-27.2%).\n\nOn the other hand, imports amounted to USD 62.8 billion, registering a reduction of 18.9%.

In turn, imports fell by 8.5%, with breakdowns of 1.7%, 15.7% for consumer and intermediate goods, 28% in the maquila sector, and only capital goods recorded a growth of 0.4%.\n\nMeanwhile, remittances experienced a growth of 4.63%, reaching USD 8.2 billion, higher than the previous year's 3.2% growth. Finally, progress was made in tax collection 79 , which was 2.4% higher than budgeted at the beginning of 2023 and 5.1% higher than the amount collected in 2022.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## El Salvador - Annual inflation Fuente: Banco Central de Reserva y c\u00e1lculos DaMortgage.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Inflation\n\n## Fiscal policy and risk ratings\n\nIn 2023, inflation started with a marked downward trend, going from an annual variation of 7.03% in January to an indicator of 1.23% in December. Unlike in 2022, the government did not implement price control measures (fuels), only maintaining the traditional subsidies for electricity, transportation, propane gas, and drinking water services. In terms of categories, food and non-alcoholic beverages had the highest growth, averaging 7.9% throughout the year. On the other hand, according to the IMF, the estimated inflation for 2024 will be close to a rate of 2.4%.\n\nSource: Central Reserve Bank and Davivienda's calculations.\n\nAccording to data from the Ministry of Finance, as of December 2023, the debt balance of the non-financial public sector (NFPS) was USD 19.4 billion, registering an annual decrease of USD 5.3 billion and representing 55% of the country's GDP, a reduction of 21 percentage points from the 76% of GDP recorded at the end of 2022. The reduction was related to the dissolution of the Trust for Pension Obligations (FOP) and the transfer of the Pension Investment Certificates (CIP) to the new Salvadoran Institute of Pensions (ISP), in accordance with the special law issued in December 2022. In this sense, the reforms allowed the pension debt balance (USD 9.5 billion as of December 2023) to be accounted for within the Financial Public Sector. When considering only the NFPS (excluding the effect of pensions), the annual increase in debt was 5%.",

Additionally, the government and the pension fund administrators (AFP) agreed on a grace period of 4 years, during which no interest or capital will be paid for the pension debt. After this period, a 7% annual interest will be amortized over a 50-year term.\n\nOn the other hand, in 2023, after the pension system reform, Fitch Ratings downgraded the sovereign rating from CC to RD (default) and subsequently to CCC. Meanwhile, Standard & Poor's (S&P) downgraded its rating to SD (default) from CCC+ on May 9, but a day later, it raised it again to CCC+. Later in November, S&P improved the rating to B- from CCC+, establishing a stable outlook. According to S&P, the improvement was due to the short-term debt reprofiling strategy. Moody's, on the other hand, affirmed the rating at Caa3, improving the outlook from negative to stable.\n\nAdditionally, in September, the Ministry of Finance announced an agreement with the national banking sector to modify the conditions of short-term debt (maximum period of 365 days) by issuing local bonds with maturities of 2, 3, 5, and 7 years. This allows for a reduction in short-term public debt levels and a better medium-term debt maturity profile. At the time the measure was announced, the balance of short-term debt was USD 2.4 billion, of which USD 1.7 billion would be distributed across the aforementioned maturities.\n\nFinally, El Salvador recorded a deficit of USD 860 million in 2022, representing 2.6% of that year's GDP. As of November 2023, the fiscal deficit amounted to USD 307.7 million (1% of GDP), which is a 179% reduction compared to the same period of the previous year; however, this reduction was influenced by the dissolution of the FOP (similarly to the public debt).\n\n## Financial Sector\n\nThe Central Reserve Bank, in its annual Financial Stability report, indicated that as of the first quarter of 2023, the\n\nbanking system experienced a notable reactivation in its role as a facilitator of resources to the economy, with credit growth rates exceeding 10%. However, since the second quarter of 2023, its behavior has tended to moderate towards pre-crisis averages. Nevertheless, financial institutions continued to exhibit adequate liquidity and capital strength, as well as good metrics for credit risk management and efficiency, allowing them to achieve optimal profitability indicators.\n\nBanks, cooperative banks, and savings and credit institutions have different sources of financing to obtain financial resources for banking intermediation operations. The main sources of financing for the Salvadoran banking system are deposits (87.2%), external financing (8.8%), and own issuance securities (4.5%). On the other hand, the Basic Passive Interest Rate (TIBP) and Basic Active Interest Rate (TIBA) have shown a significant increase compared to 2022. The TIBP, corresponding to 180-day term deposits, ranged between 4.90% and 5.58%, with an average of 5.26%,\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nexperiencing an increase of 71 bps compared to the previous year (4.54%). The upward trend in active rates is related to the increase in deposit remuneration and the higher returns demanded by investors for debt instruments issued by banks in the local securities market.\n\n- 80 With the 2017 reform, affiliates were allowed to withdraw 25% of their individual pension savings balance before reaching retirement age. This advance had to be repaid in cash or work years.",

Other sources of revenue included foreign trade taxes (5%), road contributions, and social spending (11%). Compared to the previous period, there was a 14% increase in indirect taxes, while direct taxes decreased by 2%. This decrease was due to a 1% drop in income tax collection, which represents 89% of direct taxes.\n\nAs for current expenditure, it increased by 12% compared to 2022 and represented 89% of total revenues (87% in November 2022), while capital expenditure absorbed 15% of revenues (12% in November 2022). The increase in these items was due to higher transfers to municipalities as\n\npart of the poverty reduction strategy and debt service payments, which saw a 19% growth compared to 2022.\n\nRegarding the public debt of the Central Administration, the Ministry of Finance reported a decrease as of September 2023 for the third consecutive year, representing 47.1% of GDP (49.5% in September 2022).

Moody's, on the other hand, highlighted that there were no changes in its risk rating and assigned a B1 rating with a stable outlook. The signing of a new agreement with the IMF in August 2023, for a three-year period and an amount of USD 830 million, along with the government's containment of the fiscal deficit with stable medium-term metrics, are some of the main factors highlighted by the agencies in their reports.\n\n## Financial Sector\n\nIn the financial sector, the financial system continues to show strength and dynamism. The financial stability report prepared by the Central Bank of Honduras as of June 2023 highlighted compliance with the minimum solvency regulatory requirements, in line with data published by the supervisory authority (National Commission of Banks and Insurance). As of December 2023, it is worth\n\nnoting that the asset quality showed an improvement, decreasing from 2.35% in 2022 to 2.16% in 2023, which can be attributed to efficient risk management. On the other hand, loan placements reflected a growth of 19%, contributing to improved profitability ratios, closing with an average of 14.46% in 2023 compared to 14.16% in 2022.\n\nDue to increased lending, the financial system required more resources, resulting in an annual increase of 11.18% in the deposit portfolio in 2023. Checking accounts (7%) and fixed-term deposits (16%) were the main sources of deposits, representing approximately 78% of the financial system's deposit structure. However, this was insufficient to meet the existing demand, leading to an 18% growth in interbank lending (both domestic and foreign) in 2023 compared to the previous year. This resulted in a decrease in liquid assets within the financial system, returning to pre-pandemic levels.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Honduras - Main financial sector figures and indicators\n\n(in USD million)\n\n|                     | Amount        | Amount         | Amount         | Variation (1)   | Variation (1)   |\n|---------------------|---------------|----------------|----------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n|                     | December 2023 | December  2022 | December  2021 | 2023-2022       | 2022-2021       |\n| Total assets        | 40,557        | 35,283         | 32,777         | 15.3%           | 8.5%            |\n| Investments         | 4,103         | 4,863          | 4,486          | -15.5%          | 9.3%            |\n| Total loans (2)     | 23,301        | 19,592         | 17, 0 0 9      | 19.2%           | 16.2%           |\n| Commercial          | 16,652        | 14,401         | 12,881         | 15.9%           | 12.7%           |\n| Consumer            | 4,756         | 3,668          | 3,020          | 29.9%           | 22.5%           |\n| Mortgage            | 3,316         | 2,716          | 2,337          | 22.4%           | 17. 2%          |\n| Other assets*       | 13,173        | 10,827         | 11, 283        | 21.9%           | -3.2%           |\n| Liabilities         | 36,879        | 31,896         | 29,678         | 15.9%           | 8.4%            |\n| CDs                 | 7, 8 61       | 6,576          | 6,045          | 19.8%           | 9.7%            |\n| Savings             | 11, 283       | 10,539         | 9,890          | 7. 3%           | 7. 5%           |\n| Other liabilities** | 12,495        | 10,218         | 9,903          | 22.6%           | 4.0%            |\n| Checking accounts   | 5,239         | 4,563          | 3,840          | 15.1%           | 19.8%           |\n| Equity              | 3,698         | 3,391          | 3,099          | 9.3%            | 10.3%           |\n| ROA (3)             | 2.2%          | 2.5%           | 1.8%           |                 |                 |\n| ROE (4)             | 11.6%         | 14.0%          | 9.2%           |                 |                 |\n\nSource: National Banking and Insurance Commission (CNBS).\n\n- * Other assets include: Cash and cash equivalents, contingent assets and other assets.\n- **  Other liabilities include: Financial costs payable, other deposits, bank obligations, accounts payable and subordinated term obligations.\n- (1)  Variations are in local currency.\n- (2)  Figure corrected for accumulated impairment estimation on loans and interest and loan subsidy, according to the balance sheet reporting methodology for the Financial System of the CNBS.

According to INEC (2023), this growth was mainly driven\n\nby the performance of the construction, wholesale and retail trade, manufacturing industries, electricity and water, hotels and restaurants, and land passenger transportation sectors.\n\n## Panama - Gross domestic product\n\n(Annual percent change)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSource: INEC Panama and Davivienda's calculations.\n\nRegarding trade with the rest of the world, INEC reported favorable external conditions that positively impacted transportation activities, operation of the Panama Canal, and mining and quarrying activities until the third quarter of the year. Specifically, in this last period, there was a 10.8% increase in value added for the transportation sector and a 21.2% increase for the mining and quarrying sector.\n\nDespite operational contingency measures due to drought, the Panama Canal recorded a 12.7% annual increase in toll revenues from January to November, while the total number of vessel transits decreased by 4.9% during the same period. Regarding mining and quarrying, it is worth noting that the government announced in early December 2023 the closure of the copper mine and the cancellation of the contract with Minera Panama.",

However, there were external pressures on food supply and increases in energy tariffs, which in turn pushed prices higher.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn April 2023, the subsidy on the price of 95-octane gasoline was eliminated, and in January 2024, the subsidy on 91-octane gasoline and diesel was also removed. Additionally, the subsidy on electricity tariffs, which covered customers with a consumption of up to 750 kilowatt-hours per month 86 , was eliminated starting from January 2023. This subsidy was granted through the Tariff Stabilization Fund (FET) 87 and was a relief measure within the framework of the Covid-19 emergency.\n\nMore precisely, the inflation report for the month of December showed an annual growth of 1.91% in consumer prices, higher than the minimum reached of -0.64% in the year-on-year variation in June, but lower than the 2.1% of the same period the previous year. According to INEC (2023), the increase was mainly explained by the groups: housing, water, electricity, and gas, which had a 9.9% increase, education with a 3.7% increase, goods and services with a 3.6% increase, among others.\n\n- 86 In the first semester of 2022, the Panamanian government highlighted that it subsidized 48% of the bill for those who consumed up to 300 kWh and 34% of the bill for those who consumed from 301 to 750 kWh.\n- 87 The ordinary subsidy to the electricity tariff for customers with consumption below 300 kWh per month remained.

This reduction was possible thanks to a 14.9% increase in total revenues compared to a 10.9% increase in total expenses annually. Within revenues, tax revenues grew by 9.1% and non-tax revenues by 24.5% annually. On the expenditure side, capital expenditures decreased by 4.3%, while transfer payments increased by 14% and debt interest payments increased by 63% annually. Public debt as a proportion of GDP decreased from 57.9% to 56.3% between December 2023 and December 2022.\n\nIn terms of risk ratings, Moody's downgraded Panama's rating in October from Baa2 to Baa3, while S&P and Fitch Ratings changed the outlook from stable to negative. The main motivation was the increase in fiscal challenges and, in the case of S&P, the potential negative impact on investor confidence and economic growth due to the cancellation of the contract with Minera Panama.\n\nThe Superintendence of Banks of Panama (SBP) highlighted in its Financial Stability Report that for the first half of 2023, the profitability and performance of credit institutions continued to show signs of improvement and adequate levels of liquidity and solvency within regulatory limits.\n\nAccording to the SBP, the improvement in profitability in 2023 was due to increased lending and a decrease in provisions for asset deterioration, continuing the positive cycle of the post-pandemic portfolio. The SBP highlighted the positive performance of the construction sector's loan portfolio, which has been showing positive annual growth since June 2023, not seen since May 2018.\n\nIn terms of solvency, the capital adequacy ratio for the International Banking Center was 16% as of June 2023, higher than the regulatory minimum of 8%. Finally, the asset quality deteriorated in 2023, reaching 2.7% in November, compared to 2.6% in the same period of the previous year.

As collaterals help mitigate credit risk by backing loans with tangible assets that can be liquidated to cover losses, provisions associated with these loans can be less intensive. Consequently, the expected loss is lower when discounting the potential recovery of the collateral, allowing the Bank to adjust the coverage levels for these portfolios.\n\nIn this sense, the coverage ratio including collaterals, allows for better recognition of credit risk exposure, as it includes the collaterals backing the obligations. At year-end 2023, the ratio was 132.3%\n\n<!-- image -->",

This result is mainly explained by the decrease in financial obligations with foreign entities and the revaluation of the peso against the dollar.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Banco Davivienda - Funding sources\n\n(in COP trillion, except percentages)\n\n|       | December  2023   | December  2023   | December 2022   | December 2022   | Variation   | Variation             |\n|-------|------------------|------------------|-----------------|-----------------|-------------|-----------------------|\n|       | Balance          | Percentage       | Balance         | Percentage      | Balance     | Percentage            |\n| 47. 3 | 31.0%            | 55.4             | 35.4%           | - 8.1           | -14.6%      | Savings accounts      |\n| 15.9  | 10.4%            | 17. 8            | 11.4%           | -1.9            | -10.5%      | Checking accounts     |\n| 60.2  | 39.4%            | 46.6             | 29.8%           | 13.6            | 29.2%       | Term deposits         |\n| 12.8  | 8.4%             | 15.0             | 9.6%            | -2.1            | -14.3%      | Bonds                 |\n| 16.3  | 10.7%            | 21.6             | 13.8%           | -5.3            | -24.6%      | Credits with entities |\n| 152.6 | 100.0%           | 156.4            | 100.0%          | -3.9            | -2.5%       | Funding sources       |",

The growth in the year is mainly due to interbank operations, given that by the end of 2023 operations in the money market increased.\n\nGross loans closed at COP 103.1 trillion, a decrease of 4.0% annually. The commercial portfolio closed at COP 42.9 trillion, decreasing by 3.8% compared to the previous year, mainly due to lower dynamics in the corporate and business portfolios, accompanied by the slowdown in the commercial and industrial sectors in 2023.\n\nThe consumer portfolio totaled COP 28.8 trillion, decreasing 16.5% compared to the previous year, in line with lower credit demand, as well as the new origination and write-off policies implemented in Colombia.\n\nThe mortgage portfolio closed at COP 31.5 trillion, increasing by 10.8% annually. This behavior is mainly due to the performance of the low-income housing portfolio, where there has been a greater dynamic in the allocation of government subsidies.\n\nLoan loss provisions reached COP 6.89 trillion, increasing 4.7% compared to the previous year. The annual increase is explained by the risk dynamics of the credit portfolio, mainly in the consumer segment, given the increase in delinquency levels.\n\nThe investment portfolio closed at COP 19.6 trillion and increased by 10.4% compared with December 2022. The cash and interbank funds increased by 35.7%, as a result of a higher level of liquid assets yielded through active money market operations, compared to a year ago.\n\nIn 2023, we remained the second largest bank in Colombia in terms of gross loans. As of December, our market share was 15.17% 88 .\n\nFinally, other assets increased by 12.7% compared to the previous year. The annual growth was mainly seen in accounts receivable for network compensation and the balance in favor of income tax.\n\n## OUR MORTGAGE PORTFOLIO\n\nclosed at COP 31.5 trillion, increasing 10.8% compared to 2022.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

The overall increase is due to the materialization of a credit cycle with increases in delinquency levels in the financial system in Colombia.\n\nThe Bank's net financial margin had an annual decrease of COP 2.1 trillion, equivalent to a reduction of 66.4%.\n\nLikewise, non-financial income increased by 44.6%, mainly explained by the income received from the transfer of shares of the subsidiaries Banco Davivienda Internacional Panam\u00e1 S.A and Banco Davivienda Panam\u00e1 S.A. at fair value, in return of the subscription of Holding Davivienda Internacional S.A shares, additionally, the performance of commissions and services revenues also contributed to this growth.\n\nOperating expenses closed at COP $4.3 trillion, increasing by 13.3% compared to the accumulated figure in December 2022.

Additionally, this increase can be attributed to higher expenses of industry and commerce tax, and deposit insurance.\n\nThe accumulated profits before taxes for 2023 reached COP -922 billion, an annual decrease of 169.7%.\n\nThe accumulated income tax as of December 2023 was COP -1.0 trillion, decreasing compared to the accumulated figure in the same period of the previous year, due to the fiscal loss of the period and the use of deductions contemplated by law.\n\n## Banco Davivienda - Results as of December 2023\n\n(in COP billion, except percentages)\n\n## Variation\n\n|                                       | December 2023   | December  2022   | Amount   | Percentage   |\n|---------------------------------------|-----------------|------------------|----------|--------------|\n| Financial income                      | 17,623          | 12,549           | 5,074    | 40.4%        |\n| Loan income                           | 16,213          | 12,492           | 3,721    | 29.8%        |\n| Investment income                     | 1,484           | 228              | 1,256    | 549.8%       |\n| Interbank income                      | -74             | -171             | 98       | - 57. 0 %    |\n| Financial expenses                    | 11,085          | 5,770            | 5,315    | 92.1%        |\n| Gross financial margin                | 6,539           | 6,779            | -241     | -3.6%        |\n| Provision expenses                    | 5,455           | 3,552            | 1,904    | 53.6%        |\n| Net financial margin                  | 1,083           | 3,228            | -2,144   | -66.4%       |\n| Operating income                      | 1,629           | 1,622            | 7        | 0.5%         |\n| Operating expenses                    | 4,307           | 3,801            | 506      | 13.3%        |\n| Foreign exchange and derivatives, net | -86             | 244              | -330     | -135.2%      |\n| Other income and expenses, net        | 758             | 30               | 729      | 2454.1%      |\n| Result before taxes                   | -922            | 1,322            | -2,244   | -169.7%      |\n| Taxes                                 | -1,028          | 183              | -1, 211  | -662.6%      |\n| Net result                            | 106             | 1,139            | -1,034   | -90.7%       |",

In Colombia, we experienced the lowest economic growth in the last decade - excluding the pandemic - joined by lower credit offering and demand, as well as high deposit and lending rates.\n\nOur financial results reflected the challenging operating environment that has materialized since mid-2022,\n\nbeing impacted by higher funding costs that pressured our net interest margin and higher provisioning expenses.\n\nWithin this context, we have capitalized on several lessons to strengthen our management, by taking several measures to protect our business' performance. For example, we have been implementing various strategies to improve our credit portfolio profile, to gradually adjust our funding composition safeguarding our margins, to strengthen other sources of income, and to improve productivity, so that we can capture greater efficiencies in our operations.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Additionally, we continue to support our 23.6 million customers in Colombia and Central America, with a market share of 15.17% 1 and 8,96% 2 , respectively, and a gross loan portfolio of COP 136 3 trillion\n\nIn this way, we remain determined in our vision for the future, and we\n\nare convinced that there are multiple opportunities to seize. We remain focused on our strategy, leveraging our digital capabilities and sustainable management, to continue working towards our higher purpose.\n\nOver more than half a century of experience, we have faced and overcome various obstacles, and each challenge has been a valuable lesson that strengthens our resilience and drives us to continue building the bank of the future.\n\n## OUR STRATEGY IS SUSTAINABLE\n\nResponsible banking is one of the most important pillars of Davivienda, and every day we work towards harmonizing economic objectives with global commitments to the environment and society.\n\nIn 2023, our sustainable loan portfolio increased by around 20% compared to 2022, reaching COP 17.1 trillion, representing a 12.6% share of the total gross loan portfolio. We are consistently advancing towards our\n\ngoal of making 30% of our portfolio sustainable by 2030.\n\nBeyond being a banking solution, we aim to transcend towards the health and financial well-being of our customers through tailored products and services, as well as financial education content. In 2023, this content reached nearly 19 million people, including both customers and non-customers, from children to retirees.\n\nIn terms of climate, we recognize the importance of acting rapidly to address this global challenge. One of our action plans is to increase our disbursements in environmentally sustainable projects.\n\nFor example, in the agricultural sector, we work to improve access to financing for the sector companies, as well as to protect the most vulnerable population. We reach small-scale producers with financial inclusion solutions, technical assistance and climate adaptation. In this regard, we closed 2023 with a 14% market share in the agricultural sector, financing\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n52 thousand producers, over 30 thousand SMEs in 763 municipalities in Colombia, and providing climate change protection through parametric insurance to nearly 14 thousand low-income smallscale producers. This solution was designed in partnership with Finagro and Seguros Bol\u00edvar.\n\nOn the other hand, we acknowledge that our impacts and dependencies on climate and biodiversity are concentrated not in our operations but in the activities we finance. Therefore, we measure on an annual basis the evolution of greenhouse gas emissions from our asset portfolio, initially focusing on commercial banking and some investment vehicles.\n\nThus, we act to guide our corporate and business clients on their path towards an orderly, fair, and equitable energy transition, increasing our involvement in financing lowemission green businesses, funding projects that contribute to energy transition and efficiency, renewable energy generation, optimization\n\nof productive resources, cleaner production, and sustainable infrastructure.\n\nAdditionally, in order to strengthen our actions in terms of financial health, climate, and nature management, and in line with our vision of being Net-Zero by 2050, in 2023 we joined various initiatives such as UNEP FI (United Nations Environment Programme Finance Initiative) and its Principles for Responsible Banking (PRB), as well as the NZBA (Net Zero Banking Alliance), GFANZ (Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero), and SBTi (Science Based Targets Initiative).\n\nAt Davivienda, we are committed to making the world our home, and we will continue working to make it more prosperous, inclusive, and green.\n\n- 1 Source: Financial Superintendence of Colombia.

From our role in the financial sector, we strive to offer\n\nsustainable financial solutions that allow our clients to make structural changes in their businesses, promote mitigation and adaptation to climate change, manage potential negative impacts, and contribute to the conservation of biodiversity.\n\nIn 2023, we embodied this vision as an organizational priority through the exercise of our dual materiality :\n\nimpact and financial. In this exercise, we prioritized and declared natural capital as a material issue, that is, our commitment to promote initiatives for businesses to contribute to the protection, conservation, restoration, and regeneration of ecosystems and resources, as well as to mitigation and adaptation to climate change, and that, in addition, lead to a resilient and low-carbon economy, yielding positive results for nature.",

We also ensure due diligence processes to avoid the promotion of actions that threaten life and ecosystems, and we work to ensure that our financial solutions yield results that positively impact nature.\n\nDavivienda has initiatives in place to manage emissions , ranging from the reduction of water and energy consumption and the mitigation of our greenhouse gas emissions, which represent less than 0.2% of\n\nall emissions, to the financing of sustainable construction projects, the leveraging of non-conventional renewable energy (NCRE) and circular economy projects, among others. These initiatives seek to reduce the bulk of the Bank's emissions, i.e., financed emissions. This is driven by a sustainable culture in which we mobilize our people and all our stakeholders towards this shared purpose of making the world, our home, more prosperous, inclusive, and green .\n\nSince 2014, we have been designing lines of credit with environmental benefits that contribute to adaptation and mitigation to climate change and that seek to generate a positive impact on business investments. We align our commitments to the highest global standards, seeking to adopt best practices in climate change management on an ongoing basis.

This allows us to identify, manage, and disclose the opportunities, risks and financial impacts arising from climate change.\n\nOn the other hand, in 2022 we joined the Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials (PCAF) with the purpose of measuring our financed emissions and the Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI), which aims to promote responsible investment to create sustainable markets.\n\nIn 2023, and in the interest of maturing our sustainable financial practices and the integration of Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) criteria in our operations and investments, we joined the United Nations Environment Programme Finance Initiative (UNEP-FI) and its Principles for Responsible Banking (PRB), the Net Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA) and the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ), in line with our vision of being Net-Zero by 2050, and SBTi (Science Based Targets Initiative). Under these actions, the next few months will be crucial in setting our science based GHG emission reduction targets so that they contribute meaningfully to climate change mitigation.\n\nIn this, our third TCFD report, we show progress on climate management and our commitment to align with the most up-to-date scientific recommendations to effectively address climate change and mitigate its impacts and continue to play an active role as catalysts for financial resources in high-impact projects, thus contributing significantly to the transition to a more sustainable and climate-resilient economy.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Particularly at Davivienda, in 2023 we carried out an exercise to prioritize our contribution to the SDGs in the context of Latin America and the Caribbean, and at the local level with the National Planning Department (DNP). To this end, we took as a starting point the double materiality exercise to align ourselves with the strategic issues identified and valued by Senior Management, our stakeholders, risk management and financial planning.\n\nThe theoretical basis of this process was the prioritization methodology proposed by the CODS (Center for the Sustainable Development Goals of Latin America and the Caribbean), which provides tools for a better understanding of the SDGs from the business environment and thus, to be able to articulate the contribution to the 2030 Agenda with clear strategic activities.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

We develop actions that allow us to support our clients with solutions that encourage them to believe, grow and consolidate their activity. We also support them in the transformation and adoption of more sustainable practices through the specialized offer of green and social credit facilities. As of December 2023, the portfolio balance of green loans for SMEs in Colombia exceeded COP 60 billion. We highlight the use of resources for the financing of renewable energy projects (48%), agro-sustainability (31%), energy efficiency (9%) and electric and hybrid productive vehicles (6%), contributing to sustainable economic growth and the efficient use of resources.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## SDG 9 Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure\n\nTarget 9.4: By 2030, modernize infrastructure and convert industries to be sustainable by using resources more efficiently and promoting the adoption of clean and environmentally sound industrial technologies and processes, and engaging all countries to take action according to their respective capacities.\n\nWe are a strategic ally in the financing of high-impact infrastructure projects for the development of the countries we serve, supporting road, port, power generation and transmission and real estate projects, among others, which contribute to the competitiveness and progress of the regions.\n\nAdditionally, through Construction, Corporate and Business banking, we contribute to the transformation and adoption of more sustainable practices in the different economic sectors we finance. As of December 2023, these three banking portfolios account for approximately 84% of our sustainable portfolio in Colombia, with a portfolio balance exceeding COP 3.6, highlighting the financing of certified sustainable construction projects with a balance of COP 1.6 trillion (45%), Agro-sustainable lines with COP 1.0 trillion (28%) and sustainable infrastructure projects with COP 785 billion (21.6%). In Central America, this portfolio balance totals USD 243 million, highlighting the use of resources for renewable energy (60%) and clean production (28%).\n\nThis allows us to contribute to the reconversion of industries in economic sectors such as agriculture and construction, support their transition towards sustainability, and support our clients with financing alternatives for the adoption of technologies that optimize the use of resources.",

In 2023, we reinforced this knowledge in Colombia and Central America.\n\nBased on the identification and management of climate change risks, both physical and transitional, we are moving forward on the path of consolidating these issues and their mitigants in the business strategy to make decisions on the different fronts. In this way, we are prepared to face potential emerging risks and to capture opportunities in the countries where we have a presence.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Estimating financed emissions is key to setting our sciencealigned GHG emissions reduction targets to contribute meaningfully to climate change mitigation, in line with our vision to be Net-Zero by 2050.\n\nAt the end of 2022, we completed our first estimate in accordance with the methodological parameters at the time. In 2023, to conduct the annual estimate, we adopted the latest update of the PCAF methodology, which included a change in the classification\n\nof economic activities, and, therefore, in the corresponding emission factors, increasing activity-level granularity. Additionally, we adopted PCAF recommendations to include inflation correction and currency type factors in the calculations. Based on these developments, and in order to maintain consistency and comparability between the estimates made year by year, we made the decision to recalculate our financed emissions reported at the end of 2022, which led to an updated result and greater input data coverage compared to the original calculation.\n\nFor 2023 estimate, available data of the obligations of the commercial portfolio at the end of 2022 was used as input data according to the methodological parameters. For this estimate, we expanded the coverage of measured assets according to\n\nthe classification established by the benchmark, also including commercial loans, project finance assets and corporate bonds and equities (the latter two in the investment portfolio), thereby expanding the inventory of measured emissions.\n\nSimilarly, to add high volume data from credit portfolios to the calculation, we optimized our calculation procedure by designing and implementing a tool based on a programming code, which consolidates the information of our clients for each asset measured, PCAF databases, and other parameters, to subsequently obtain an automated result for the quantification of financed emissions. This process enables us to run estimates on a regular basis, perform risk monitoring, and generate insights to prioritize our climate engagements with clients.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

This proved to be particularly challenging for customers who do not have an obligation to disclose their financial information. We will continue to work on this aspect in 2024 to improve data quality.\n\nIn 2023, we expanded the scope of our calculation of financed emissions to the Bank's subsidiaries in Central America. We set up working groups with leaders from each country to raise awareness about the importance of these estimates, and we completed a first data collection exercise for quantification purposes. In 2024 we will continue to work on refining this estimate, sharing the results, and preparing for public disclosure.\n\nAccordingly, find below our 2023 results:\n\nEstimated Absolute Financed GHG Emissions for Commercial Loans, Project Finance and Corporate Bonds and Equity Assets\n\n|                                                          | Year  2023 (2022 input information) (   | Year  2023 (2022 input information) (   | Year  2023 (2022 input information) (   | Year  2023 (2022 input information) (   | Year 2022  2021 input  information)   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|\n|                                                          | Business  Loans                         | Project  finance                        | Corporate  Bonds &  Stocks              | Total  emissions  2023                  | Business  Loans                       |\n| Total Scope 1, 2 y 3 (Mton CO2e)*                        | 4.14                                    | 0.31                                    | 0.08                                    | 4.53                                    | 4.44                                  |\n| Scope 1 y 2 (Mton CO2e)                                  | 1.98                                    | 0.07                                    | 0.02                                    | 2.07                                    | 2.47                                  |\n| Scope 3 (Mton CO2e)                                      | 2.16                                    | 0.24                                    | 0.06                                    | 2.46                                    | 1.97                                  |\n| Emissions intensity (except  corporate bonds and stocks) | 78%                                     | 78%                                     | 28%                                     | -                                       | 86%                                   |\n| Intensidad de emisiones (Mton CO2e / BCOP)               | 0.10                                    | 0.06                                    | 0.03                                    | 0.13                                    | 0.16                                  |\n| Data Quality Score                                       | 3.68                                    | 4                                       | 1.83                                    | 3.69                                    | 3.7                                   |\n\n- * Mton CO2e = Million tons of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## WE EXPANDED THE CALCULATION\n\nof financed emissions in Central America.\n\nAfter recalculating 2022 estimates, we arrived at a new value for total absolute emissions financed of 4.44 million tons of CO2e for commercial loan assets, a 54% increase over the total emissions previously disclosed in our 2022 report.

For commercial loan assets, total emissions decreased by 7% compared to the 2022 measurement, given that, to measure this asset, we were able to include a greater number of customers who made and reported their own emissions estimate for their production process.\n\nThis information allowed us to have greater accuracy in the proportion of emissions attributable to our financing. We also note the low share of total carbon emissions from project finance assets (6.8%) and corporate bonds and equities (1.8%).\n\nThese two years estimations reflect a greater amount of carbon emissions associated with our borrowed or invested assets, indicating that we are improving the scope of our inventory with greater coverage of input data and measurable asset typologies. This aspect generates an advantage by subsequently defining the carbon emission reduction targets following the SBTI benchmark to which we adhere.\n\nAt the sectoral level, we found that the oil, gas, and mining sector is the one with the highest intensity of emissions with a value of 0.36, followed by the Agricultural sector with an intensity of 0.30 and, in third and fourth place, the industrial sector and Energy with an intensity of 0.28 and 0.22 respectively. In the latter, we saw the opportunity to refine the input information by integrating the emissions estimation data of our main customers, especially for thermoelectric power generation activities, which in turn allowed us to achieve an information quality level of 2.06, improving our calculation with respect to our 2021 fiscal year.\n\n## Estimate of Absolute GHG Emissions Financed by Sectors of the Economy 2023\n\nAssets: Business Loans, Project finance, Corporate Bonds & Stocks, (2022 input information)\n\n## Scopes\n\n| Industry                            | Data Quality  Score   | Scope 1 and 2 (MTon CO2e)   |   Scope 3 (MTon CO2e) |   Total (MTon CO2e) | Emissions  intensity  (MTon CO2e  / COP Trillion)   |\n|-------------------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|\n| 3.68                                |                       |                             |                  0.9  |                1.25 | Industrial 0.35 0.28                                |\n| Energy                              | 2.06                  | 0.5                         |                  0.12 |                0.62 | 0.22                                                |\n| Oil, Gas & Mining                   | 3.79                  | 0.17                        |                  0.33 |                0.5  | 0.36                                                |\n| Agricultural                        | 3.91                  | 0.44                        |                  0.15 |                0.58 | 0.30                                                |\n| Construction                        | 3.96                  | 0.26                        |                  0.33 |                0.58 | 0.17                                                |\n| Services                            | 3.98                  | 0.2                         |                  0.24 |                0.44 | 0.05                                                |\n| Transport                           | 4                     | 0.03                        |                  0.03 |                0.06 | 0.02                                                |\n| Commerce                            | 3.91                  | 0.08                        |                  0.34 |                0.42 | 0.09                                                |\n| Financial, Insurance &  Investments | 3.58                  | 0.04                        |                  0.02 |                0.06 | 0.01                                                |\n| Public Sector                       | 4                     | 0.00                        |                  0    |                0    | 0.00                                                |\n| Total                               | 3.69                  | 2.07                        |                  2.46 |                4.53 | 0.13                                                |\n\nNotes based on PCAF standard:\n\n- \u00b7 Scaling up Scope 3 emissions for all sectors taking into account PCAF recommendations.\n- \u00b7 Funded customers from all stages of the value chain in different sectors are included.\n- \u00b7 Data quality level between 1 and 5 obtained from the calculation of the weighted average score of the weight of portfolio balances in the sector and classification of CO2 emissions data source.\n\n<!-- image -->",

To achieve this, we participate in various projects that promote reforestation, deforestation prevention and the generation of renewable power. These are some of the projects:\n\nVichada Zero CO2 Forestry Project, located in the municipality of Puerto Carre\u00f1o, Department of Vichada. Tree species such as Acacia, Eucalyptus, Rubber, and Pine are used in this project.\n\nHidrobarrancas and La Rebusca run-of-the-river hydroelectric power plants, located in the department of Antioquia. These plants use the water needed to generate power, allowing the rest to flow back into the river, which helps to reduce the environmental and social impacts caused by large reservoirs.\n\nREDD+ PEACEcific Project, located in the North of the Department of Nari\u00f1o and in the west of the Department of Cauca, specifically in the municipalities of Mag\u00fc\u00ed and Santa B\u00e1rbara. This project covers a total area of 288,170 hectares, of which 273,718 hectares (94.98%) are stable forest over time.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nLikewise, in 2023, with the aim of contributing to the conservation of biodiversity, we carried out the Plant with Senses activity, in collaboration with Fundaci\u00f3n Bolivar Davivienda, positively impacting four ecosystems located in the Departments of Cundinamarca, Boyaca, Antioquia and the Coffee Region, planting more than 1,200 trees, with the participation of 1,916 associates and family members in Colombia and International\n\nSubsidiaries.\n\nAlong with these large projects and the carbon neutrality certification, at Davivienda we adhere to the SBTi initiative with the purpose of structuring our reduction goals for each of the scopes of the inventory of GHG emissions associated with the Bank's operation. Thus, in 2024 we will work under this methodology by establishing goals with significant impact that contribute to the fulfillment of the sustainable development goals.",

This assigned risk rating is incorporated as a parameter in the reference model for the calculation of credit risk provisions for the commercial portfolio.\n\nMy audit procedures to evaluate the assignment of the credit risk rating and the effect on the provisioning of the commercial portfolio included, among others, the following:\n\n- \u00b7 Involvement of professionals with experience and knowledge in credit risk assessment and information technology, to evaluate certain internal controls related to the process performed by the Bank for the determination of the provisioning of the commercial portfolio. This included controls associated with (1) validation of the credit risk rating assignment methodology and/or models according to regulatory provisions, (2) the Bank's monitoring of the credit risk rating assignment and the resulting provisioning value, (3) information technology controls over the inputs to the commercial portfolio provisioning models, as well as the provisioning calculations; and (4) the evaluation to identify if there was a significant change in the credit risk of the commercial portfolio.\n- \u00b7 Inspection of a sample of commercial loan portfolio files to verify that the rating granted to customers complies with the guidelines defined by the Superintendency of Finance of Colombia for the allowance system and that it is supported by the financial, qualitative or economic characteristics of the customer and its subsequent incorporation into the reference model for the calculation of allowances.",

This transaction generated an effect in the statement of income for profit on sale of $451,806.\n\nI considered the estimation of the fair value of this transaction as a key audit matter, because it is a material transaction that is not performed on a recurring basis, which involved significant management judgment in the determination thereof, which required significant audit effort to evaluate the related evidence, including the involvement of valuation professionals with specific skills and industry knowledge.\n\nThe auditor's judgment was required to evaluate the methodology used by the Bank to estimate the fair value of the investment, as well as the relevant unobservable inputs and assumptions of the methodology, which include the projected results, discount rate and perpetuity.\n\nThese  controls  included:  1)  Board  of  Directors approval of the transaction, 2) Approval of the transaction  by  regulators  in  Colombia  and Panama, 3) involvement of an external expert in the value determination and analysis.\n\n- -Involvement  of  valuation  professionals  with specific skills and  industry  knowledge  who assisted me in: (i) the comparison between the valuation methodology applied by the Bank with the  methodologies  generally  applied  in  the market for that purpose and with the provisions set forth in IFRS 13, (ii) the analysis of the main assumptions included in the projections versus historical data and comparison of the macroeconomic assumptions and discount rate with  market  data,  when  available,  (iii)  the recalculation of: the Companies' net income and dividend  flow  projections,  the  perpetuity  rate, discount  rate  and  net  present  value,  (iv)  the financial analysis to verify the variations of the Companies' income, cost and expense lines.\n\n## Other matters\n\nThe separate financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022 are presented solely for comparative purposes, were audited by me and in my report dated February 24, 2023, I expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\n\nResponsibility of the Bank's management and those charged with corporate governance for the separate financial statements\n\nManagement is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these separate financial statements in accordance with Accounting and Financial Reporting Standards accepted in Colombia. This responsibility includes: designing, implementing and maintaining such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of separate financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error; selecting and applying appropriate accounting policies; and making accounting estimates that are reasonable in the circumstances.",

Reasonable assurance means a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise due to fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these separate financial statements.\n\nAs part of an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs, I exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism during the audit. I also:\n\n- \u00b7 Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the separate financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures in response to those risks and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is greater than that arising from error, because fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override or override of internal control.\n- \u00b7 I obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances.\n- \u00b7 Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.\n- \u00b7 I conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern assumption and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may indicate significant doubt about the Bank's ability to continue as a going concern. If I conclude that a material uncertainty exists, I should draw attention in my report to the disclosure describing this situation in the separate financial statements or, if such disclosure is inadequate, I should modify my opinion. My conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of my report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Bank to cease to operate as a going concern.\n- \u00b7 Evaluate the overall presentation, structure, and content of the separate financial statements,\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n6\n\nincluding the disclosures, and whether the separate financial statements present the underlying transactions and events so as to achieve a fair presentation.\n\n- \u00b7 I obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the group financial statements. I am responsible for the direction, supervision, and performance of the Group's audit. I remain solely responsible for my audit opinion.\n\nI communicate to those charged with governance of the Bank, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit, as well as significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that I identify during my audit.\n\nI also provide those charged with governance with confirmation that I have complied with relevant ethical independence requirements and that I have disclosed to them all relationships and other matters that might reasonably be considered to bear on my independence and, where applicable, related safeguards.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with those charged with governance, I determine the matters that were of most significance in the audit of the current period's separate financial statements and, therefore, are the key audit matters. I describe these matters in my Auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely exceptional circumstances, I determine that a matter should not be communicated in my report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably outweigh the benefits to the public interest of such communication.\n\n## Report on other legal and regulatory requirements\n\n- 1. Based on the results of my tests, in my opinion, during 2023:\n- a) The Bank's accounts have been kept in accordance with legal regulations and accounting techniques.\n- b) The operations recorded in the books are in conformity with the bylaws and the decisions of the General Shareholders' Meeting.\n- c) The correspondence, account vouchers, minute books and share registry books are duly kept and maintained.\n- d) There has been compliance with the rules and provisions of the Financial Superintendence of Colombia related to the adequate administration and provision of assets received in payment and with the implementation and impact on the separate statement of financial position and separate statement of income of the applicable risk management systems.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Colombia\n\n+57 (601) 618 8000 +57 (601) 618 8100\n\nwww.kpmg.com/co\n\n## (FREE TRANSLATION OF THE REPORT ISSUED IN SPANISH)\n\n## STATUTORY AUDITOR'S REPORT\n\nTo the Shareholders Davivienda S.A.:\n\n## Opinion\n\nI have audited the consolidated financial statements of Banco Davivienda S.A. y Subsidiaries (the Group), which comprise the consolidated statement of financial position as at December 31, 2023 and the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income, changes in equity and cash flows for the year then ended and their respective notes that include the summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory notes.\n\nIn my opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of the Group as of December 31, 2023, the consolidated results of its operations and its consolidated cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with Accounting and Financial Reporting Standards accepted in Colombia, applied on a basis consistent with that of the preceding year.\n\n## Basis for opinion\n\nI conducted my audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing accepted in Colombia (ISAs). My responsibilities in accordance with those standards are described in the section 'Statutory Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the consolidated Financial Statements' of my report. I am independent with respect to the Group, in accordance with the Code of Ethics for Accounting Professionals issued by the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants (IESBA Code) included in the Information Assurance Standards accepted in Colombia together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to my audit of the consolidated financial statements established in Colombia and I have complied with my other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the IESBA Code mentioned above. I believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion.\n\n## Key audit matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in my professional judgment, were of most significance in my audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of my audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole and in forming my opinion thereon, and I do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPhone\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2\n\n## Assessment of Impairment of Loan Portfolio under IFRS 9 (see notes 6, 10.3.1.4, 12.5.1 y 12.5.4 to the consolidated financial statements)\n\n## Key Audit Matter\n\n## How it was addressed in the audit\n\nThe Group periodically reviews the credit risk exposure of its loan portfolio. Such determination is one of the most significant and complex estimates in the preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements, due to the high degree of judgment involved in the development of models to determine impairment based on an expected loss approach required by IFRS 9. The value of the loan portfolio and its respective impairment as of December 31, 2023 is $135,974,563 and $6,075,511 million, respectively.\n\nI considered the assessment of loan portfolio impairment as a key audit matter because it involves significant measurement complexity that required judgment, knowledge and experience in the industry particularly in relation to (1) the evaluation of the methodologies used, including the methodology for estimating loss given default; (2) the probability of loss given default and its key factors and assumptions; (3) the loan grading and qualitative factors that are incorporated within the internal model variables established by the Group; and (4) the estimated credit risk impairment calculations for the entire loan portfolio.\n\nMy audit procedures for assessing the adequacy of credit risk impairment included, among others, the following:\n\n- \u00b7 Engagement of professionals with experience  and  expertise  in  credit  risk assessment and information technology to evaluate certain internal controls related to  the  Group's  process  for  determining loan  portfolio  impairment.  This  included controls  related  to  (1)  validation  of  the models that determine the probability of loss, LGD and exposure at default, (2) the Group's monitoring of the determination of portfolio impairment (3) information technology controls over the input data to the models that determine credit impairment, as well as related calculations; (4) the assessment to identify  whether  there  was  a  significant change in credit risk; (5) the evaluation of macroeconomic  variables  and  weighted scenarios  used  in  the  models  for  the determination of credit portfolio impairment;  and  (6)  the  verification  of controls related to the evaluation  of individually  analyzed  trade  receivables and write-offs.\n- \u00b7 Professionals with expertise in credit risk assessment  and  information  technology assisted me in (1) evaluating the methodologies  and  key  data  used  to determine  the  probability  of  loss,  loss severity and exposure at default and the parameters produced by the models; ; (2) evaluating  the  macroeconomic  variables and weighted probability scenarios used in the internal models including consideration of alternative data for certain      variables; (3)   recalculating   the",

Reasonable assurance means a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise due to fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken based on these consolidated financial statements.\n\nAs part of an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs, I exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism during the audit. I also:\n\n- \u00b7 Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one arising from error, because fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- \u00b7 Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances.\n- \u00b7 Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.\n- \u00b7 Conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern assumption and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether or not a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may indicate significant doubt about the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. If I conclude that a material uncertainty exists, I should draw attention in my report to the disclosure that describes this situation in the consolidated financial statements or, if this disclosure is inadequate, I should modify my opinion. My conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of my report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to operate as a going concern.\n- \u00b7 Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements present the underlying transactions and events so as to achieve a fair presentation.\n- \u00b7 Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. I am responsible for the direction, supervision, and performance of the Group's audit. I remain solely responsible for my audit opinion.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n6\n\nI communicate to those charged with governance of the Group, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that I identify during my audit.\n\nI also provide those charged with governance with confirmation that I have complied with relevant ethical independence requirements and that I have disclosed to them all relationships and other matters that might reasonably be thought to bear on my independence and, where appropriate, related safeguards.\n\nF rom the matters communicated with those charged with governance, I determine the matters that were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and, accordingly, are the key audit matters. I describe these matters in my Auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely exceptional circumstances, I determine that a matter should not be communicated in my report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably outweigh the benefits to the public interest of such communication.\n\n(\n\nOriginal signed in Spanish) Gustavo Adolfo Roa Camargo Statutory Auditor of Banco D avivienda S.A.

These standards are periodically evaluated by the Vice Presidency of Internal Audit and other control bodies.\n\nBanco Davivienda S.A.'s ICS features the following characteristics:\n\n- \u25cf To encourage and maintain an adequate control environment built upon organizational culture, raising employee awareness.\n- \u25cf To continuously strengthen the established risk management systems, supporting operations by establishing objectives, identifying incidents, assessing them, and responding to risks.\n- \u25cf Define and implement control activities and procedures required to manage risks; periodically assess how such activities and procedures are performed and formulate mitigation plans accordingly to the evaluated risks.\n- \u25cf Take appropriate actions aimed at protecting, storing, accessing, preserving, safeguarding, and disclosing information, ensuring data reliability, integrity and availability; effectively communicating key information to relevant parties and stakeholders.\n- \u25cf Set and enforce policies and procedures to ensure continuous monitoring and oversight by management and senior management.\n\nTo verify the effectiveness of the ICS, the Bank is supported by the Audit Vice-presidency, the Statutory Auditor's Office, and the Risk Management areas who, according to the three lines of defense model, carry out evaluation and monitoring; likewise, they identify the areas that execute internal control from the First Line. The above, in the following way:\n\nFirst Line: Composed of the owners of the processes responsible for: the identification of risks associated with the processes under their responsibility, including those of financial reporting from the origin of transactions to the corresponding preparation, consolidation and disclosure; the design, execution and supervision of controls that mitigate their risks, reporting of risk events and the formulation and implementation of action plans when required.",

Based on its findings, it shares recommendations to improve processes and operations. Key financial reporting controls are embedded in these evaluations. The assessments in 2023 were conducted under the approved planning, following a risk-level prioritization exercise for the various processes within the Bank, guided by the process map, strategic objectives, and regulatory and legal obligations. No material deficiencies were identified upon revision of financial reporting-related processes.\n\nInternal Audit followed up on the action plans defined by those responsible for processes, who followed the recommendations made and continue to do so; similarly, the Audit Committee and additional Corporate Governance bodies monitored the status of implementation and effectiveness of such plans, thereby contributing towards achieving our mission to present and disclose financial information properly.\n\nAs a result of the activities conducted by the three defined lines, no significant deficiencies were detected that would have prevented the recognition, measurement, and disclosure of the financial information.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nLegal Representative RICARDO LE\u00d3N OTERO\n\n<!-- image -->",
