        "page_content": "## Chairman's Report\n\nThe past year was another period of signi/ficant change for Lendlease.\n\nOur operating landscape was characterised by continued pressure on property markets - stemming from ongoing interest rate uncertainty, contributing to a di/fficult macroeconomic outlook in the four regions in which Lendlease operates.\n\nAs a developer of large urban projects, Lendlease's bottom line performance is reliant on our ability to work in partnership with capital partners in order to create value from our development products.\n\nHowever, the commencement of new developments over the past year was once again impacted by slower markets and the reluctance of capital partners to commit to transactions in an uncertain environment.\n\nEven with that challenging backdrop, there were signi/ficant achievements across the core business which demonstrated the strength of our people and assets, including the delivery of $8.2b of development completions and the creation of $3.4b of new funds under management (FUM) product.\n\nNotwithstanding these achievements and our response to these challenges, including business simpli/fication, cost reduction and reduced headcount, the prolonged property cycle downturn, and its impact on Lendlease's operating earnings and security price, necessitated a fundamental review of our /five-year Reset; Create; Thrive strategy.\n\n## Strategic refresh\n\nFollowing extensive deliberation over the last year, including with external stakeholders, the Board endorsed a comprehensive update of the Group's strategy. This was triggered by the structural and prolonged cyclical changes that have impacted the global property sector post pandemic.\n\nIn summary, the strategy prioritises the liberation and return of capital to securityholders; investing in the high performing Australian business, which has historically demonstrated strong performance through-the-cycle; the exit of international construction operations; and the accelerated release of capital from long dated international development projects.\n\nWhile this is a fundamental change for the business, the decisions taken recognise the need for signi/ficant action at an accelerated pace to deliver value for securityholders.\n\nThese decisions leverage Lendlease's competitive strengths and simplify the company to become a leading integrated real estate business in Australia with an international investment management platform.\n\nManagement have already delivered a number of signi/ficant milestones that were initiated over the last 12 months as the strategic refresh was under development. These include the simpli/fication of our US operations by realising value from the sale of our Military Housing business and the divestment of our Construction business; the establishment of a real estate investment platform with Warburg Pincus that realises the value we have created in our life sciences, construction and development businesses in Asia; and processes underway for the sale of a further c.$0.9b of assets.\n\n## Financial outcomes\n\nAs a result of the costs associated with implementing the strategy, largely relating to impairments and restructuring charges, the Group recorded a substantial Statutory Loss. I recognise this is a disappointing outcome for securityholders. However, it is imperative we make these changes to set Lendlease up for future success.\n\nThe full year distribution and dividend payment of 16 cents per security was maintained and re/flects a payout ratio of 42 per cent of Core Operating Earnings.\n\n## Securityholder engagement\n\nAs representatives of the company, it is important to maintain an active program of engagement with securityholders. In my capacity as Chair, I regularly meet with investors, government, customers and other key stakeholders to listen to their views and gather feedback.\n\nThis year, stakeholder engagement included receiving input as the refreshed strategy was developed, and on Chair succession and executive reward, with more than 30 meetings held.\n\n## Chair and Board renewal\n\nAs announced in May, I will retire as Chair following the conclusion of the 2024 Annual General Meeting (AGM). It has been a privilege to serve on the Lendlease Board as a Non Executive Director since 2011 and as Chair since 2018.\n\nI am working with my fellow directors on Chair succession which is well underway. A market announcement will be made once we have completed that process.\n\nNicola Wake/field Evans will also be retiring from the Board at the 2024 AGM. On behalf of the Board, I thank Nicola for her contribution to Lendlease since her appointment in September 2013. Nicola has been Chair of the Board Sustainability Committee since 2019 and a member of the Board Audit Committee and Board Risk Committee. The Board has appreciated her counsel and insights on a broad range of matters.\n\nWe also welcomed Barbara Kno/flach as a Non Executive Director. Barbara is an outstanding addition to the Board, and her background in real estate, asset management and investment management supports our objective to grow our international Investments platform. She brings relevant sector insights and her appointment, together with the appointments of Bob Welanetz, Nick Collishaw and Margaret Lui in recent years, re/flects a disciplined approach toward Board renewal focussing on Lendlease's core sectors of real estate and investment management.\n\nNick Collishaw will be standing for reelection at the AGM this year. Nick's re-election is unanimously supported by the Board; he is an experienced property executive with more than 40 years' expertise gained across Investments, Development and Construction.",

This reinforced our view of the need to demonstrate strong alignment between remuneration outcomes for executive management and the experience of our securityholders.\n\nAccordingly, given the poor /financial outcomes for securityholders, the CEO and his leadership team will not receive a Short Term Award for FY24.\n\nFurther information on our approach is detailed in the Remuneration Report on page 68.\n\n## Re/flection on the past, looking to the future\n\nThis is my /final year as your Chair and, as I re/flect on my six years in the role, it has been characterised by signi/ficant challenge for Lendlease, both strategically and in the operating environment we have faced.\n\nMy /first term as Chair commenced shortly after the announcement of the problems in our Engineering business, which led to a strategic review and decision to exit the business - a signi/ficant undertaking given the scale and complexity of the operations. This was followed by the onset of the global pandemic and leading the Board's support of management as we dealt with the\n\nincredibly challenging task of maintaining our global construction and development activities in the face of an unprecedented operating environment. I am immensely proud of how our teams around the world responded.\n\nMy second term has been characterised by the strategic challenges posed by signi/ficant structural changes and a prolonged cyclical downturn post pandemic. During this period, I led the appointment of a new CEO, and am delighted at how Tony has transitioned into the role. Through this period there has been a substantial re/finement of our strategic focus, extensive restructuring of our operations, and the delivery of signi/ficant operating e/fficiencies.\n\nThe culture of Lendlease is a special and resilient one. The diligence and commitment of our people across the business has been truly remarkable, and the achievements and outcomes for our clients around the world during this time deserve to be recognised and commended.\n\nThere has been constant Board renewal throughout my Chairmanship which has focussed on increasing the depth of real estate and investment experience around the Board table.\n\nDuring my time on the Board I have been immensely proud of the continual improvement in the health and safety outcomes for our people through a relentless focus by management on this critical area. I am also proud of our industry leadership in all aspects\n\nof sustainability - with bold actions to respond to climate change, and continuing our founder's commitment to maintaining a social licence to operate.\n\nLendlease is at a critical juncture in its history. The Board and management have thought very carefully about the necessary strategic actions and taken some tough decisions.\n\nI am con/fident we have the right team and commitment to realise the value inherent in our business on behalf of securityholders. And I am determined to dedicate my /final months with this great company to achieving a smooth transition to the Board's new leadership.\n\nI thank my fellow Directors and the entire Lendlease team for their ongoing dedication to repositioning the organisation for sustainable future growth.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nM J Ullmer, AO Chairman",

        "page_content": "## Group Chief Executive Officer's Report\n\nTransforming our company into one that delivers sustainable /financial returns to securityholders has been my priority since becoming CEO three years ago.\n\nAnd while we made substantial inroads delivering against the /five-year turnaround plan announced in FY22, a prolonged market downturn combined with a high proportion of capital allocated to long dated developments in o/ffshore businesses has impacted returns and has necessitated substantial further action.\n\nIn May 2024, we announced a refreshed strategy to position Lendlease for /financial success. A strategy that leans into our proven core strengths and competitive advantages.\n\nIts key elements are:\n\n- \u00b7 Simplify our organisational structure and achieve further cost reductions\n- \u00b7 Focus on our market-leading Australian business and international Investments platform\n- \u00b7 Divest international Construction\n- \u00b7 Recycle $4.5b of capital by completing divestment transactions and accelerating capital release from o/ffshore development projects and assets.\n\n## Strategy in action\n\nThe business has moved quickly to implement the changes we believe are required to become the leading integrated real estate business in Australia with an international Investments platform.\n\nCentral to the strategy is the establishment of the Capital Release Unit (CRU) designed to liberate more than $4.5b of capital from the business, including $2.8b from the divestment of on-market assets; the divesting of international Construction operations; and the release of $1.7b of capital primarily from international Development.\n\nOf the $2.8b of assets on market targeted to be divested in FY25, more than half of the transactions have already been announced. These include the sale of our integrated life sciences interests in Asia into a new joint venture; the sale of 12 Australian master-planned Communities projects; and the sale of our US Military Housing business.\n\nIn parallel, we are realising a further $125m of pre-tax cost savings across the business as we simplify our management structure and move to being a leaner and more focussed organisation.\n\nFrom a capital allocation perspective, our priorities are to strengthen the balance sheet, return up to $500m of capital to securityholders and invest in our high return Australian operations. We'll also continue to build on our Australian development pipeline to support future earnings and focus on pro/fitable growth within our Investments platform.\n\nBy reshaping our business to concentrate on our core competencies in markets where we have proven capabilities and a strong competitive advantage, the /financial and operational risk pro/file is expected to be lower, and the quality of our earnings ultimately higher and more sustainable.\n\n## Financial and operating performance\n\nRe/flecting impairments and restructuring charges primarily associated with the divesting of international construction and the capital release from o/ffshore development projects, the Group recorded a Statutory Loss after Tax of $1,502m.\n\nCore Operating Pro/fit after Tax was modestly higher at $263m, compared with $257m in the prior year. The completion of Residences One, Barangaroo and The Exchange TRX in Kuala Lumpur, as well as consideration received for value created at the San Francisco Bay Area project, contributed to the result.\n\n## Investments\n\nOur funds under management (FUM) ended the year at $47.3b. Despite ongoing challenging market conditions resulting in negative revaluations, several developments were completed that support future FUM growth.\n\nBoosting our sustainable workplace portfolio, Melbourne Quarter Tower was completed. We also added a build to rent asset in Chicago and the /first phase of our data centre project in Tokyo. Contributing to assets under management, The Exchange TRX opened in Kuala Lumpur, and is exceeding performance expectations.\n\nThere are currently eight international projects underway with key capital partners that are expected to add more than $6b in FUM over coming years, enhancing our existing international platform of more than $19b of FUM and Australian platform of $28b.\n\n## Development\n\nDevelopment activity increased, with $8.2b of completions and $1.9b of commencements.\n\nResidential buildings in Sydney, New York and Kuala Lumpur were completed, along with various products contributing to FUM, listed in the Investments section of this Report.\n\nLeveraging our placemaking capability and supporting the replenishment of our Australian development pipeline, we secured the $1.3b Gurrowa Place project at the Queen Victoria Market site in Melbourne.\n\n## Construction\n\nIn our Construction segment, a disciplined approach to cost management has been a priority. We took steps in the US by winding down West Coast and Central operations, and recently agreed terms for the sale of the East Coast operations.\n\nAs we transition to focus on our Australian business, which has a backlog of $3.9b and a strong preferred book, we'll look to build upon our strong capabilities in the defence, social infrastructure and workplace (including life sciences) sectors.\n\n## Focussing on the things that set Lendlease apart\n\n## Physical safety and wellbeing\n\nThe health and safety of our people, our subcontractors and those who interact with the places we create and manage is our highest priority. We have continued to embed a culture of care across the organisation, which encompasses physical and product risks as well as psychological safety.\n\nAcross more than 400 operations encompassing more than 80 million hours worked, this year there were no fatalities recorded, which is an outstanding e/ffort from our people and supply chain partners.",

This is a pleasing result in light of the transformation underway across the business.\n\nLeadership and learning and development programs have been prioritised, in addition to wellbeing and mental health initiatives. More than 400 leaders participated in global leadership programs.\n\nI thank all our teams around the world for their resilience and ongoing commitment to delivering exceptional outcomes for our customers.\n\n## Customer centric ethos\n\nOur customer centric approach remains steadfast. To remain focussed, each year we undertake a broad range of customer listening and insights research.\n\nPleasingly, there is a continued strong level of repeat business. This includes repeat purchasers across our luxury Sydney apartment developments; strong tenancy renewals at our o/ffice buildings at Barangaroo South; capital partners with multiple investments across asset classes and geographies; and government and corporate clients trusting us with their project management and construction requirements.\n\n## Leadership in sustainability\n\nSince launching our industry-leading Mission Zero targets, we are on track to achieve our 2025 milestone of Net Zero Carbon for Scope 1 and 2 emissions. We are also approaching our target of creating $250m of social value by 2025, having generated $222m of social value through shared value partnerships, including $36m in FY24.\n\nThese business imperatives are /firmly\n\nembedded into the organisation across all business segments and are fundamental to how we create long term value. Further, industry leadership in sustainability, whether it be environmental or social, is valued by a high proportion of our stakeholders, including customers, capital partners and employees, helping us attract and retain talent.\n\n## Outlook\n\nAs we enter the new /financial year, our refreshed strategy is underway.\n\nOur Australian business is market leading and unique in the breadth and strength of its integrated capability and services. The opportunities to grow remain signi/ficant, with a project pipeline that plays to our core competitive strengths, especially in urban regeneration. Our valued relationships with major global capital partners presents an appealing long term growth pathway to extend our international funds platform.\n\nOur immediate priorities are to strengthen our balance sheet, return capital to securityholders and invest in our\n\nhigh return Australian operations, while continuing to build on our Australian development pipeline to support future earnings growth.\n\nI believe that through the decisive actions announced in May, we have outlined a clear path for our people, customers and securityholders.\n\nMy thanks to our Board, particularly our Chairman who is retiring at the AGM in November. I have greatly valued his counsel and support. I also thank my Management Team and the people of Lendlease for their unwavering dedication.\n\nFinally, to our securityholders - I restate our commitment to restore securityholder returns.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTony Lombardo\n\nGroup Chief Executive O/fficer",

        "page_content": "## Our strategy\n\n## In May 2024, we announced a refreshed strategy to improve securityholder value and position the Group for pro/fitable future growth.\n\nLendlease is underpinned by an ethos that long term value creation is maximised by achieving social, environmental and economic outcomes. This involves collaborating with customers, investment and development partners, governments and the communities within which we operate.\n\nFollowing a prolonged downturn in the property cycle and an uncertain interest rate environment, third party capital commitments for projects have been subdued. As a result, our economic outcomes have been adversely a/ffected, particularly for our o/ffshore development operations.\n\nNotwithstanding the reset of the organisation in FY22 and the subsequent actions undertaken to address business complexity and pro/fitability, substantial further action was required.\n\n## Simpli/fication and refocus\n\nIn May 2024, we announced a refreshed strategy to improve securityholder value and position the Group for pro/fitable future growth.\n\nWe have a market leading integrated Australian business that delivers strong through-the-cycle returns.\n\nHowever, approximately two thirds of the company's capital is currently deployed in o/ffshore projects and assets. These projects have excellent fundamentals but they are long dated and their expected returns are too far into the future.\n\nWe are therefore taking necessary and signi/ficant steps to simplify the Group and release more than $4.5b of capital, while refocussing our e/fforts towards our high returning integrated Australian business and our international investment management capabilities.\n\nFurther information about the strategic initiatives can be found in the Investments, Development and Construction segments on pages 16, 18 and 20 of this Report.\n\n## Strategic priorities\n\nThe new structures and processes that support the strategy took e/ffect from 1 July 2024 and execution of the strategy is anticipated to be substantially progressed by the end of FY25.\n\nThe key strategic actions supporting the strategy are:\n\n- \u00b7 Restructure the organisation and reduce costs\n- \u00b7 Divest $2.8b of assets on-market and target the return of up to $500m of capital to securityholders\n- \u00b7 Divest international Construction operations\n- \u00b7 Release $1.7b of capital from international Development, net of liabilities and other o/ffsets.\n\nA Capital Release Unit (CRU) has been established to maximise embedded value from $2.8b of on-market assets, the divestment of international Construction operations, and the release of $1.7b of capital from international Development.\n\n## Strong progress on strategy execution\n\nSigni/ficant work has already been undertaken and we are well advanced on several fronts, including:\n\n- \u00b7 Removing our regional management structures and introducing segment focussed Chief Executives to drive performance\n- \u00b7 Announcing the sale of our integrated life sciences interests in Asia into a new joint venture with Warburg Pincus\n- \u00b7 Announcing the sale of 12 Australian master-planned Communities projects\n- \u00b7 Announcing the sale of our US Military Housing business\n- \u00b7 Divesting US Construction following the agreed heads of terms for the sale of the East Coast operations and wind down of West Coast and Central operations.\n\nThere are ongoing processes for the sale of the remaining 25 per cent investment in the Keyton retirement living business, our senior living asset in China, and our interest in The Exchange TRX commercial assets in Kuala Lumpur.\n\n## Competitive advantage and growth prospects\n\nA key di/fferentiator from other industry participants is our end-to-end capability across real estate from concept and planning to design and delivery, through to capital partnering and investment management. This is the essence of our integrated model.\n\nThere are signi/ficant growth opportunities in Australia, with a current addressable market of approximately $40b in urban regeneration projects that play to our competitive strengths.\n\nOur international Investments platform has deep relationships with global capital partners, and we intend to leverage our existing scale and improve performance through active portfolio management, together with introducing new products.\n\nFuture growth will be underpinned by the investment grade product we expect to create from our development pipeline, in addition to our global capability to launch new products alongside investment partners.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSimplifying the organisation and reducing costs",

In line with the strategy update announced in May 2024, it facilitates the release of capital and intended redeployment into the Australian business or select investment management opportunities.\n\nOur capabilities, including placemaking and the ongoing curation of the assets we manage for our capital partners, are complementary to our funds management expertise and derive an annuity-style income stream.\n\n## Investments portfolio\n\nOur co-investment portfolio is valued at $3.6b and includes positions in our managed funds and a 25 per cent equity interest in Keyton (retirement living).\n\nThe portfolio is diversi/fied across a range of sectors, including workplace ($1.0b), residential ($0.6b), retail ($1.0b), retirement ($0.5b) and industrial ($0.3b). This is expected to reweight over time post the targeted divestment of the /final 25 per cent interest in Keyton (retirement living) that will move into the Capital Release Unit in FY25.\n\nOptimisation of the portfolio and capital redeployment opportunities are continually being assessed.\n\n## Leading sustainability targets and credentials\n\nOur commitment to leading industry transformation in decarbonisation is demonstrated in our Mission Zero targets - some of the most ambitious in the real estate sector.\n\nWe have delivered some of the world's most sustainable real estate, which attracts capital partners and quality tenants, as well as contributing to investment performance and our competitive edge.\n\nOur projects and assets consistently achieve the highest sustainability ratings, and we maintain leading positions on ESG assessments and benchmarks, including WELL and GRESB.

MQT tenants currently include Medibank, Beca and the Seven Network.\n\nAs we begin to emerge from a subdued leasing environment, there has been activity across the portfolio, including Victoria Cross Over Station development and Blue & William in North Sydney and Town Hall Place in Melbourne.\n\nWe see opportunity in the sector for well located, next-generation assets, with /first class sustainability credentials and we are extremely well positioned to leverage our integrated development capabilities in this sector.\n\n## Retail\n\nPart of the 17-acre lifestyle quarter of TRX, The Exchange TRX is strategically located in Kuala Lumpur's /first dedicated international /financial district. The project has more than 400 retailers across 1.3 million sqft of net lettable area and was the /first retail asset in Malaysia to achieve LEED Gold certi/fication, highlighting a commitment to sustainability.\n\n## Data centres\n\nLocated 30km north of central Tokyo in Saitama, the /first phase of one of Japan's largest data centres was completed. Phase 1 of the project is a six-storey, 48 MW facility which has been purpose built for Princeton Digital Group.\n\n## Delivering the pipeline\n\nOur development pipeline is categorised in three phases: In Conversion; Master planned; and Work in Progress (WIP).\n\n- \u00b7 In Conversion represents the earliest stage of development when a project is secured but yet to achieve master plan approval. For larger projects, this can take up to three years from the date a project is secured, though for smaller projects the conversion period may be shorter.\n- \u00b7 The Master planned phase provides security of overall entitlements with development approvals being obtained. This phase allows us to develop, invest, sell down or proceed in phases, accelerate or pause development depending on prevailing market conditions and business priorities.\n- \u00b7 Once a project begins construction, known as 'commencement', it moves into active delivery, progressing to the Work in Progress phase and through to completion.\n\n## FY24 Development activity includes:\n\n## Completions\n\n- \u00b7 Residences One, Barangaroo, Sydney\n- \u00b7 Claremont Hall, New York\n- \u00b7 The Reed, Southbank, Chicago\n- \u00b7 Park & Sayer, London\n- \u00b7 Melbourne Quarter Tower\n- \u00b7 The Exchange TRX, Kuala Lumpur\n- \u00b7 Data centre, Tokyo\n- \u00b7 Innovation centre, Yokohama\n\n## Commencements\n\n- \u00b7 Build to sell apartments at Elephant Park and Silvertown, each in London\n- \u00b7 Luxury build to sell apartments, Victoria Harbour, Melbourne\n\n## Capital-e/fficient partnership approach\n\nOur Development strategy will be facilitated by a more capital e/fficient development model.\n\nWe aim to introduce capital partners early to manage our capital position. This allows us to diversify execution risk and capital allocation for the Group while sharing in project returns.\n\nThis includes a greater emphasis on joint venture partnerships, managing Lendlease's economic interest per project and providing opportunities for origination, development, performance and long term funds management fees.\n\n## Communities sale\n\nIn December 2023, we announced the sale of 12 of our Australian Communities projects.\n\nThe sale will be a key step in simplifying the Group, allowing the Development segment to focus on urban regeneration. The transaction, which is due to complete in FY25, forms part of the $2.8b of assets being marketed for sale, as referenced in the 'Our strategy' section on page 15 of this Report.\n\n## Strategic direction\n\nWith the objective of deploying more capital into our high return Australian business, we are targeting the release of a further $1.7b of net capital primarily from our international development projects.\n\nWe aim to achieve this in three ways:\n\n- \u00b7 Selling land and inventory held on our balance sheet\n- \u00b7 Progressing land management agreement projects through additional planning and entitlement and working with our existing partners to introduce new partners or sell land to third parties to develop\n- \u00b7 Completing the eight joint venture projects that are already underway with capital partners and, once complete, transferring them to FUM in the Investments segment and reducing our co-investment position when stabilised.\n\nThe Development segment will be led by a dedicated Chief Executive who will focus on the following strategic areas:\n\n- \u00b7 Expanding the development pipeline in Australia\n- \u00b7 Increasing capital partnering with a focus on productivity and returns\n- \u00b7 Originating product aligned to capital partner preferences.\n\n## Replenishing the pipeline\n\nIn March 2024, the Gurrowa Place redevelopment project in Melbourne was secured. Part of the Queen Victoria Market precinct, the project has an estimated end development value of $1.3b and is set to comprise a sustainable workplace; build to rent apartments; $0.4b of student accommodation (alongside student accommodation partner, Scape); and a large public park.\n\nOur Australian development pipeline has an estimated end value of approximately $12b, including Gurrowa Place. We are in the advanced stages of securing up to $13b of opportunities across /five projects, where we are either 'one of two' or in exclusive discussions, and are in the early stages on a further $27b of new opportunities which are concentrated on the east coast of Australia and play to our strengths in urban regeneration.\n\nAustralia's signi/ficant transport infrastructure investment o/ffers the opportunity to unlock prime city locations and deliver highly connected precincts, particularly across the Sydney and Melbourne Metro lines. Lendlease has core capability in this regard, including current integrated development projects at Victoria Cross and Martin Place stations in Sydney and Town Hall Place in Melbourne.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

This informed a dedicated focus on enhancing our risk management approach across key potential exposures relating to our end products. The ongoing focus on in/fluencing improved outcomes across the design, planning and delivery phases of our projects is aimed at improving the safety, quality and integrity of the products we create.\n\nOur focus on psychological safety included a global rollout of Psychological Safety workshops across all regions. The 49 workshops conducted by Group Environmental Health and Safety (EHS) Teams and People and Culture Teams also included training of facilitators to continue the roll out of the program by local resources. The focus group feedback, survey results and analysis of key themes will form part of the dedicated focus on psychological safety to be provided in support of Lendlease's refreshed strategy.\n\n## Safety performance\n\nIn line with our steadfast commitment that every worker should return home safely each day, no fatal incidents were recorded across our portfolio for the /financial year where we have operational control. Our supply chain also maintained a fatality-free operational environment during FY24.\n\nWe acknowledge the focus and dedication of our people and supply chain partners in achieving a fatality-free year, encompassing more than 80 million hours worked across more than 400 operations where health and safety outcomes were measured across our portfolio this year.\n\nNotwithstanding the accomplishment of a fatality-free year, our Critical Incident Frequency Rate (CIFR) and Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate (LTIFR) outcomes represent minor increases compared to the best on record outcomes recorded in FY23.\n\n## Percentage of operations without a critical incident 1\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 1.

Calculated to provide a rate of instances per 1,000,000 hours worked.\n\n## Excellence in innovation\n\nThe Sano/fi project in Singapore won Lendlease's Global Employee Excellence Award for Safety Excellence & Innovation (Team).\n\nThe project has also won Safety and Health Award Recognition for Projects (SHARP) with the Singapore Government, which is a recognition of their excellent safety performance and innovations implemented.\n\n## Future focus\n\nAs our safety culture continues to mature, and our organisational direction changes into FY25, we are adopting some key adjustments to our safety approach:\n\n- \u00b7 Measuring safety performance: We will include a wider range of lead and lag indicators to provide a more rounded representation of safety performance. A combination of these indicators will be used to create a safety index to monitor performance across our business internally. While we will continue to report on lag EH&S metrics (such as fatalities, critical incidents and lost time injuries), we will also monitor additional indicators to identify consistency across a range of assurance-related items to demonstrate our focus on the identi/fication and management of risk to prevent incidents from occurring.\n- \u00b7 2025 EH&S Global Minimum Requirements (GMRs): The next iteration of our GMRs will be developed and launched in FY25 to simplify our approach to EH&S management. This approach will be supplemented with revised standard operating procedures for the origination, planning and delivery phases of the operational lifecycle for each of our Investments, Development, and Construction entities.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

In the short to medium term, debt reduction and capital returns to securityholders will be prioritised over growth.\n\nBy the end of FY26, we are aiming to reach our revised target gearing level of 5-15 per cent. In addition we will look to return up to $500m of capital to securityholders as capital is released from the $2.8b of assets that are currently onmarket, subject to the following:\n\n- \u00b7 Completion of the previously announced Communities transaction\n- \u00b7 Forecast gearing reaching target 5-15 per cent level by the end of FY26\n- \u00b7 Maintaining existing credit ratings\n- \u00b7 Buy-backs being accretive to EPS\n\nGoing forward, we'll continue to assess the merits of debt reduction, investing for growth and returning capital to securityholders.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOpposite: Sydney: Residences One One Sydney Harbour\n\n## Measuring performance\n\nRe/flecting the Group's refocussed strategy, evolving market conditions and a continued focus on securityholder returns, external market guidance will focus on Earnings Per Share (EPS) from FY25.\n\nGroup Return on Equity (Group ROE 1 ) will continue to be the Group's primary long term measure of return for securityholders.

We have a history of constructing these assets in the Americas and Europe, completing 2,800 apartments since 2019.\n\nIn major cities around the world, BTR projects are in demand, investment grade assets, supported by industry fundamentals of housing shortages, government policy, demographic change, city migration trends and investor appetite.\n\nBy applying this expertise, along with more than 60 years of capabilities and leadership, we are enhancing customer value through our growing domestic pipeline of approximately 1,800 BTR apartments, including the recently announced Gurrowa Place . In partnership with the City of Melbourne, this project will deliver around 560 BTR apartments as part of the broader $1.7b redevelopment of the southern site of the iconic Queen Victoria Market. Gurrowa Place is our second BTR project in Melbourne and our third in Australia.\n\nInternationally, our BTR o/ffering at The Reed at Southbank in Chicago continues to prove the popularity of Lendlease living, reaching 95 per cent occupancy, on budget and a full month ahead of schedule. This echoes similar leasing success at Elephant Park in London, which we highlighted in this section of our 2023 Annual Report.\n\n## Going deeper with key investors\n\nJapanese investment in global real estate has more than tripled since 2021.

We will see out the development and construction of the new homes, which will have an end value of circa \u00a3250m, and retain a 25 per cent interest in the project. This will be the /final stage of residential development at Elephant Park.\n\nThese two collaborations extend our strong partnership with Daiwa House, having previously worked on projects, including the 41-storey mixed-use Claremont Hall in New York, which this year commenced condominium closings.\n\n## Milestones in Asia\n\nThis year, we celebrated 50 years of operation in Singapore and The Exchange TRX opened its doors to the community inviting customers to discover the future of experiential retail.\n\nBeginning its journey as a truly dynamic and vibrant social heart of Kuala Lumpur, The Exchange TRX marked its opening with a month-long campaign that tapped into the community's enthusiasm to indulge in highly experiential year-end holiday celebrations. The opening was a resounding success that attracted more than 4.9 million people, exceeding the target by 63 per cent. The Exchange TRX mobile app was introduced, and the campaign successfully acquired approximately 5,000 members for the Lendlease Plus MY Loyalty Programme, which exceeded the target by 75 per cent.\n\nIn Japan, with partner Princeton Digital Group (PDG), we completed the core and shell construction of one of Japan's largest data centre campuses, our /first under the Lendlease Data Centre Partners facility.\n\nOur team worked tirelessly to identify the right location, design and construction schedule to deliver the services and features they need, as the Japanese Government makes e/fforts to enhance the country's data capabilities and digital resilience.\n\n## Playbook for\n\n## construction excellence\n\nOur European business continues to lead on safety, social value and the environment.\n\nAs the construction partner on 2 Aldermanbury Square in the heart of London, we are leading the delivery of a 13-storey building that will provide more than 27,000 square metres of commercial space.\n\nAlong with our client Great Portland Estates, and other businesses delivering 2 Aldermanbury Square, we are signing up to a Charter pledging to deliver in line with the principles of a new private sector construction playbook.\n\nLendlease is playing a lead role in developing the playbook, which aims to help improve the way projects are commissioned and delivered for customers.\n\nBusinesses signing up to the Charter are committing to delivering at the highest standards for their clients across measures that include health and safety, social value and the environment.\n\nThe Charter will drive higher levels of productivity and enables the most e/uniFB00ective use of available resources, while encouraging construction teams and suppliers to work in a more collaborative way to help boost productivity, quality and value for the client.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

A key focus has been strengthening our performance culture with a relentless commitment to improving /financial results anchored by our values.\n\nWe invest in learning and careers focussed on key talent in our Investments, Development and Construction segments, as a retention tool in a year of di/fficult /financial performance.\n\nWe remain committed to growing and retaining our diverse talent, in a culture where people feel valued, belong and have an opportunity to thrive.\n\nOur focus areas:\n\n- \u00b7 Culture\n- \u00b7 Leadership\n- \u00b7 Learning\n- \u00b7 Careers\n- \u00b7 A physically safe workplace\n- \u00b7 A psychologically safe work environment where wellbeing is a priority.\n\n## Culture: Relentless commitment to improving performance, anchored by our values\n\nOur values are critical. They drive the way we interact and create an environment for our people to deliver for our customers and communities. We have focussed on continuing to build a performance culture where our people understand the drivers of our /financial performance and how they can have an impact. Through our key senior leaders across the globe, we continue to focus on the transparency of current performance in Australia and o/ffshore and clarity of the work to be done to deliver to all stakeholders.\n\nWe're listening to our employees, formally through our employee engagement survey, as well as informally. Our recent global engagement survey had an 85 per cent participation rate, indicating our people care about Lendlease and how we can continually improve. High participation was supported by the ease of completing the survey, following a shift to a new model delivered through our existing employee platform, which has enabled speed, e/fficiency, cost saving and a better experience for our people.\n\nFor this year of transition, we have reported our scores in both the previous and new models, and going forward will report using the new model. Our\n\nengagement score decreased by 1 point (using the previous model); especially in the o/ffshore markets, where it decreased by 4.6 on average, re/flecting the di/fficult operating environment. Over the same time period, global benchmarks also declined. Our continued focus on retention strategies, especially learning and development has helped achieve only a modest decrease in our engagement results and has been key in retaining our talent in these challenging times.\n\nThe lowest scoring areas of employee feedback were business strategy, personal growth and autonomy.\n\nOur guiding principle of Safety continues to resonate with our people and remains among our top performing areas.\n\nOur focus in FY25 will be on our /financial performance, championing our values and providing targeted learning and development to improve the employee experience for key talent at Lendlease.\n\n## Leadership: A strong and diverse succession bench\n\nSuccession planning is a continuous focus and all key leadership roles have one or more identi/fied successors. Fifty per cent of those identi/fied successors are ready to move into the leadership roles in the near term. Key to this is prioritising the development of our top talent through a robust assessment process to inform development needs.\n\nWe are committed to enhancing gender diversity within our leadership cohort, with women currently occupying 26 per cent of leadership positions.\n\nThrough our recent engagement survey, we have collected cultural demographic data which will inform and drive our plans and targets in this space.\n\n## Learning: Investing in building capabilities\n\nOur global leadership programs have been successfully implemented across all regions, with 415 participants globally over the FY24 reporting window. These programs aim to develop leaders who are contemporary and inclusive, at every level and region.\n\nValues-based decision making learning has been conducted for our leaders and will be extended to all employees, to ensure our people prioritise the 'how' expected in achieving /financial performance.\n\nOur Ignite and Mosaic programs, which foster sponsorship of diverse talent by",

Recent business performance and cost optimisation creates a challenge for retaining top talent, resulting in /flat career structures and limited career opportunities. This has meant a need to focus on horizontal development to retain the talent necessary for key development and construction projects.\n\nWhile we achieved a retention rate of 85 per cent, this was below our target of 90 per cent.\n\nOur talent pipeline in Australia greatly depends on the acquisition of early career talent. We have hired more than 158 graduates in Australia for the graduate programme across 2023 and 2024 cohorts. Following a key focus on their engagement and experience, we have seen the engagement scores for current graduates remain consistent with this year, at 8.2.\n\n## Wellbeing\n\nPrioritising our people's health and wellbeing is fundamental to Lendlease's culture and purpose. We are committed to promoting and supporting the health, wellbeing and psychological safety of our people.\n\nOur Health and Wellbeing Framework promotes healthier minds, bodies, places and cultures through a variety of programs and initiatives to support our people. Our commitment to this has extended our certi/fication of a Global Healthy Workplace until 2024.\n\n## Psychological safety\n\nWe strive to create a culture and environment where our people are respected and supported. This includes managing psychosocial risks such as reward, recognition, work hours, the physical work environment, and creating a safe place for people to speak up and take interpersonal risks.\n\nWhile psychological safety forms part of our 3Ps safety strategy, we acknowledge that this is not the sole responsibility of our EH&S Team.

The focus groups have provided insights into what a psychological safe workplace looks like, highlighting areas of improvement and ideating solutions to implement.\n\nThese workshops have been held throughout our global operations.\n\n## Supporting our people and retaining talent\n\nFollowing the strategy update in May, our focus was on supporting our people by ensuring they received timely and clear communication and by providing certainty to people where we could. Our communication and change strategy was developed to align with the varied impacts in each market.\n\nOur change strategy provides our people and leaders with the opportunity to develop change management skills and build resilience to support themselves and others, in addition to o/ffering wellbeing support and appropriate retention initiatives.\n\nAs we move into FY25, we are focussed on providing clear targets and objectives for our people to deliver against our stated plans and reward our people accordingly.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

These emissions reductions are underpinned by the continued delivery of our Mission Zero strategy, which supports the purchase of renewable electricity, the use of renewable energy, and ongoing electri/fication across our business.\n\nGlobally, 65 per cent of our electricity use was from renewable sources, and we are well positioned to achieve our target of 100 per cent renewable electricity by 2030. We are also continuing to electrify our business operations and reduce our dependency on fossil fuels. In FY24, 66 per cent of total energy use was from electricity and 44 per cent was from renewable sources.\n\nWe continued our purchase of carbon o/ffsets for unavoidable emissions. In FY24, we o/ffset 19 per cent of our gross Scope 1 & 2 emissions of 99 ktCO2-eq, taking our net Scope 1 & 2 emissions to 80 ktCO2-eq.\n\n## Clear decarbonisation pathways\n\nOur Mission Zero carbon emission reduction targets have been veri/fied by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) as aligned with the Paris Agreement goal aiming to limit global warming to 1.5\u00b0C. Our climate transition plans, called Mission Zero Roadmaps, detail the speci/fic regional strategies and timeframes we plan to undertake to progress towards our Mission Zero targets. Mission Zero Roadmaps are supported by Mission Zero Minimum Requirements, which detail shorter-term actions to drive the appropriate rate of decarbonisation across our three lines of business to maintain our 1.5 degree aligned carbon trajectory. Together, the Mission Zero Roadmaps and Minimum Requirements demonstrate our clear intention and the tangible actions we are taking to achieve our Mission Zero targets.\n\n## Mission Zero Roadmap delivery\n\nWe continued to make strong progress in the delivery of our Mission Zero Roadmaps and are currently working on our second cycle of Mission Zero Minimum Requirements for FY25 through FY27.\n\nThe majority of our Scope 1 emissions relate to our Construction activities. To minimise these emissions, we have continued to move towards our goal of Fossil Fuel Free Construction.\n\nWe are using electric plant and equipment where available, trialling battery storage and responsibly sourcing biofuels and renewable diesel.\n\nIn Development, where possible, new buildings will be designed to take full advantage of renewable electricity through 100 per cent electri/fication of space heating and hot water requirements.\n\nWe are also progressing the lifecycle upgrade planning for existing asset infrastructure, conducting technical feasibility and prioritising buildings across our Investments portfolio for all electric retro/fit in line with our Mission",

We are also engaging with our food and beverage tenants in support of our Global Cooksafe Coalition commitments.\n\n## Examples:\n\n- \u00b7 In FY24, 99 per cent of liquid fuels used by our UK Construction business were from renewable sources.\n- \u00b7 At The Exchange TRX in Kuala Lumpur, close to 80 per cent of construction equipment was electri/fied, including a /fleet of 16 electric tower cranes.\n- \u00b7 At Melbourne Quarter West, we are using renewable diesel in concrete pumping, extending our use of imported renewable diesel in Australia.\n\nThe large majority of our Scope 2 emissions relate to our Investments portfolio. To minimise our Scope 2 emissions, we continue to focus on improving the operational energy e/fficiency of our assets, setting minimum third party energy ratings, while also generating onsite solar electricity at selected assets. Renewable electricity purchase across the business remained high, ahead of our timetable. For our Australian business, we have progressed our renewable energy procurement strategy, with preferred renewable energy providers agreed and contracts due to start from FY25.\n\nExamples:\n\n- \u00b7 At Paya Lebar Quarter, Singapore, a total of 614 solar PV panels have been installed and are projected to reduce emissions by 186 tCO2-eq in the /first year of operation.\n- \u00b7 One Melbourne Quarter achieved a market leading 6 star NABERS energy rating for the base building, incorporating a large 201kW rooftop PV array, supporting approximately 17 per cent of the base building's energy consumption.\n\nInitiatives undertaken to minimise our Scope 3 emissions include ongoing collaboration with designers, suppliers and clients to reduce embodied carbon. In Australia, we have been engaging with our key subcontractors and suppliers to understand their progress in decarbonising their manufacturing processes and sourcing low embodied carbon materials. We continue to engage with tenants to encourage the shift to renewable electricity.\n\n## Examples:\n\n- \u00b7 At 51 Flinders Lane in Melbourne, we are collaborating with GPT Group to build its /first upfront embodied carbon neutral o/ffice tower, to be certi/fied through Green Star and Climate Active upon completion.\n- \u00b7 Our portfolio of privatised military homes in the US was recognised as a 2024 Platinum Green Lease Leader for implementing energy e/fficiency best practices, including cost recovery for capital improvements and sustainability training.\n- \u00b7 In our FY24 engagement survey of Australian commercial and industrial tenants, approximately 25 per cent are already using renewable electricity. We have begun planning for the transition to 100 per cent renewable electricity as part of tenant lease renewals.\n\n## Mission Zero Progress Reports\n\nOur European business published its third annual Mission Zero Progress Report while our Americas and Asia regions published inaugural progress reports.\n\nWe have also shared our Australian Fossil Fuel Free Construction guide, detailing our plans and progress using electric equipment, battery energy storage systems, renewable diesel and biofuel.\n\n## Carbon o/ffset procurement\n\nTo achieve our Net Zero by 2025 target, we are working to reduce our Scope 1 & 2 greenhouse gas emissions as far as possible, with the remainder o/ffset via acquisition of high quality carbon o/ffsets.\n\nA central team will manage our group wide sourcing of high quality nature based carbon removals that meet our stringent assessment criteria, including independent, third party certi/fication.\n\n## Pathway to Absolute Zero\n\nWe have taken important steps to establish a pathway to measure and disclose progress towards achieving our Absolute Zero by 2040 target.\n\nOur Absolute Zero by 2040 target includes eliminating Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions, within the Lendlease de/fined boundaries and without the use of o/ffsets.\n\nAt Climate Week in New York in September 2023, we o/fficially launched the Lendlease Scope 3 Emissions Protocol v.1, our current view on the Scope 3 emission categories we have determined to be relevant to our value chain and that form part of our Absolute Zero by 2040 target.\n\nWe published the Protocol to advocate for and move towards a consistent and comparable approach to the measurement and reporting of Scope 3 emissions associated with real estate Investments, Development and Construction business activities.\n\nThe Protocol has been well received by peers and industry groups and recognised in industry leadership and impact awards, such as the Singapore Green Building Council & the Building and Construction Authority, as well as The Urban Developer in Australia.\n\nIn addition to moving forwards on Scope 3 measurement and reporting, we have continued to advocate alongside key industry groups for investment in transition and decarbonisation, joining the World Business Council for Sustainable Development's Built Environment Pathway.\n\n## Nature and biodiversity\n\nNature is one of six focus areas in our global Sustainability Framework and, given the global decline in biodiversity and increasing regulatory requirements to enhance protections for nature, we have commenced a strategic review to better understand the role we can play in protecting and restoring nature.\n\nWe have developed a framework to locate our nature interface across each line of business and to evaluate our direct nature-related dependencies and impacts. Our framework uses elements of the Taskforce for Naturerelated Financial Disclosures (TNFD) LEAP approach (locate, evaluate, assess, prepare). We have also joined as a TNFD Forum Member.\n\n## Governance\n\nWe published our ESG Databook, submitted the latest Lendlease Modern Slavery Statement and our annual United Nations Global Compact (UNGC) Communication on Progress submission.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 65%\n\nGlobal electricity use from renewable sources 1 and targeting 100% renewables by 2030",

Industry transformation will require advocacy and collaboration across the whole property value chain.\n\n## Fossil Fuel Free Construction\n\nEliminating the use of fossil fuels in construction is an essential step in tackling climate change and reaching our Mission Zero targets. On the Watermans Residences tower at One Sydney Harbour, we deployed electric construction plant and equipment and analysed the implications of switching from diesel to electric concrete pumping. We shared our /findings in The Electric Edge report, published in conjunction with University of Queensland. Electric concrete pumps showed compelling energy, carbon, and cost advantages over diesel concrete pumping. By sharing this analysis with the broader industry, we hope to support the transition towards Fossil Fuel Free Construction.\n\n## Industry advocacy\n\nWe continued to advocate for a Low Carbon Liquid Fuels (LCLF) Policy to support the establishment of a robust domestic renewable diesel industry for Australia.

Their remit was to prepare a high quality, comprehensive, global baseline of sustainability disclosures.\n\nIn June 2023, ISSB published the /first two sustainability standards, which were later endorsed by the International\n\nOrganization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO). These were based on the framework developed by TCFD. As a result, TCFD considered its remit ful/filled and o/fficially disbanded in November 2023.\n\nThe Australian Government is considering legislation to amend the Australian Securities and Investment Commission Act 2001 and the Corporations Act 2001 to introduce mandatory reporting for large businesses to disclose their climaterelated risks and opportunities.\n\nThe Australian Accounting Standards Board (AASB) has drafted the Australian Sustainability Reporting Standards (ASRS), which are based on the ISSB IFRS",

We are well placed to respond to the ASRS, given our history of voluntary disclosure under TCFD. While ASRS introduces some new and speci/fic disclosure requirements, for the most part, these build on the strategic work that Lendlease has been progressing under the TCFD framework.\n\n## Cross-functional approach\n\nAs we work to transition from TCFD to the ASRS, we have conducted a gap assessment between our TCFD related measures and ASRS disclosure requirements. Where di/fferences or gaps have been identi/fied, we have established plans to address them, often through leveraging additional information readily available across our business. We are also developing processes to capture new metrics to further assist in the ongoing monitoring and management of key climate-related risks and opportunities.\n\nFrom our initial commitment to TCFD, Lendlease undertook a cross-functional approach to assessing and reporting on climate-related risks and opportunities.\n\nClimate change can be pervasive in its impacts and, by examining the potential impacts of climate as an integrated team, we've carefully considered it using the deep knowledge of our business.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGovernance of our approach is overseen by functional working groups composed of senior leadership across sustainability, /finance, legal, and supply chain functions.\n\nWe also use our Executive Committee reporting rhythm to oversee our sustainability reporting from the business level through to the Board.\n\nTo facilitate our readiness to respond to the ASRS, we established a speci/fic Sustainability/Finance Working Group, which was formed to examine how the business can further streamline and leverage existing accounting frameworks and processes to capture climate-related /financial metrics.\n\nIn addition, a Supply Chain/Sustainability Working Group was formed to analyse potential climate-related risk concentrations across our global supply chain to proactively monitor and guide our strategic risk management planning and future disclosures.\n\n## Assessing physical climaterelated risks\n\nTo help identify and manage the physical climate-related impacts to projects and assets that Lendlease are engaged in, we have worked with Swiss Re to implement a new risk data and services (RDS) platform with geospatial physical climate and nature risk capabilities.\n\nThe RDS platform uses cutting-edge technology to help users manage current and future climate and nature risks. It provides Lendlease with access to data that was previously only available to insurance risk experts.\n\nThe deployment of the RDS platform has streamlined our physical climate risk assessment screening process for any new project proposals or asset acquisitions and is now being used to examine physical climate risk exposure across our existing assets under management. We are also using RDS data to assist in our preparation to report against ASRS in FY26.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## More information\n\nFor more information about our TCFD disclosures, please refer to our ESG Databook.

Non operating items after tax for the year ending 30 June 2024 includes costs relating to the 27 May 2024 strategy update $1,384m, other restructuring costs of $95m and UK building remediation of $17m. Prior period includes a provision in relation to UK building remediation of $295m.\n- 3. Return on Equity is calculated using Pro/fit after Tax divided by the arithmetic average of beginning, half and year end securityholders' equity.\n\n## Performance 1\n\nThe Group recorded a Statutory Loss after Tax for the year ending 30 June 2024 of $1,502m, compared with a Statutory Loss after Tax of $232m for the prior year. This includes $1,384m of impairments and charges required to implement the revised strategy announced in May 2024, comprising $805m relating to goodwill, deferred tax assets and other costs, $506m from development asset impairments and $73m of provisions relating to redundancy, tenancy and other break costs. Property revaluation losses in the Investments segment of $260m and other restructuring charges of $95m, which largely relate to redundancies announced in July 2023, also contributed.\n\nThe Group's Core Operating Pro/fit after Tax (OPAT) for the year was $263m, up 2 per cent on the prior year. Core Operating Earnings per Security was 38.1 cents, equating to a Return on Equity of 4.4 per cent. Distributions per Security totalled 16.0 cents, unchanged from the prior year, representing a payout ratio of 42 per cent of OPAT.\n\nCore segment EBITDA increased by 15 per cent to $809m. Improved Development and Construction earnings were partially o/ffset by lower contributions from Investments. Development earnings were higher following the completion of key projects in Australia and Malaysia, and a payment received in relation to the San Francisco Bay project in the US. Construction earnings were higher, including a gain from the remeasurement of UK pension scheme liabilities. Investments earnings were lower primarily due to performance in the US, noting an absence of earnings from prior year asset sales, and a /final provision taken against a receivable from the disposal of the US Telecommunications business.\n\nCorporate costs decreased 13 per cent to $140m, predominantly due to people related cost savings. Net /finance costs of $238m increased due to higher average net debt for the year and higher base rates impacting the average cost of debt. This increase was partially o/ffset by a $39m pre-tax gain from a further buy-back of the Group's Sterling bonds in the /first half of FY24. Excluding the impact of the Sterling bond buy-backs, net /finance costs were 83 per cent higher on the prior year.\n\nGearing of 21 per cent includes the impact of impairments and charges relating to the revised strategy. There is a clear pathway to de-leverage the balance sheet with net cash proceeds of ~$2.4b anticipated in FY25. This includes settlements at One Sydney Harbour, /first receipts from the sale of 12 Communities projects, completion of the sale of the US Military Housing business and the sale of the Group's Asian life sciences interests into a new joint venture.\n\nThe increase in net debt from $2.4b at FY23 to $3.2b at FY24, follows peak production capex being reached at HY24, and includes production spend on key development projects including One Sydney Harbour, One Circular Quay, Victoria Cross over station development (all in Sydney), MIND, MSG (both in Milan) and Habitat (Los Angeles) as well as Communities production in Australia.\n\nThe Group maintains strong liquidity, with total available committed facilities and cash of $2.2b. This liquidity, together with expected cash in/flows from transactions, provides the Group with /flexibility to manage its balance sheet.\n\nThe Group recorded a Non core loss of $9m which primarily re/flects overhead costs associated with the retained elements of the Engineering and Services businesses. The Group continues to maintain provisions it considers appropriate to complete its share of the retained Melbourne Metro project, which is more than 85 per cent complete, and for potential warranties associated with the exited Engineering and Services businesses.",

Details of the strategy are outlined on page 15 of this Report.\n\nAs part of the strategy, a Capital Release Unit (CRU) was established to recycle more than $4.5b of capital and to divest international Construction operations. The new structures and processes that will support the strategy were implemented on 1 July 2024.\n\nAccordingly, from 1H25, the Group will report the CRU as a stand-alone operating segment that will include:\n\n- \u00b7 International Construction operations;\n- \u00b7 International Development projects;\n- \u00b7 Australian assets to be divested, including 12 Communities projects and Keyton Retirement Living; and\n- \u00b7 Retained Engineering and Services.\n\nThe Group has also updated the de/finition of its core performance measure, OPAT, introducing a higher threshold for measuring performance and greater alignment with securityholder outcomes.\n\nFrom 1H25, the OPAT de/finition will more closely align with statutory reporting, with the only exclusion being investment property revaluations in the Investments segment.\n\nThe revised strategy also sees the replacement of the Portfolio Management Framework (PMF), with the targets announced on 27 May 2024. A Capital Allocation Framework has been established to provide a transparent hierarchy for capital deployment, with securityholder value and returns to be assessed against debt reduction, return of capital to securityholders and investing for growth. Allocation of capital will re/flect the Group's continued focus on securityholder returns, with the Group targeting a return on equity greater than its cost of equity, through-the-cycle. The Group also introduced a lower revised target gearing range of 5-15 per cent that it targets to achieve by the end of FY26.\n\nRefer to page 28 of this Report for a summary of current Group targets from its May 2024 strategy update.\n\nThe Group's operational priorities for FY25 are progressing CRU initiatives, replenishing the Australian Development pipeline, growing the international Investments platform, and furthering cost out initiatives.\n\nWithin the CRU, $1.9b 1 of asset recycling has been announced to date, with at least a further $0.9b targeted for recycling in FY25. These assets include The Exchange TRX (retail), Keyton Retirement Living and our China senior living project, Ardor Gardens, with sale processes underway for each asset.\n\nThe divestment of international Construction operations is progressing, with terms agreed in principle for the sale of the US East Coast construction operations and the UK construction business being prepared for sale.\n\nApproximately $40b of new development opportunities have been identi/fied in the Australian market, of which $13b are in an advanced stage, with Lendlease being either one of two parties competing for the project or in exclusive discussions. The Group remains well positioned to win new projects across mixed-use, residential and commercial, and will seek to add to its existing $11.8b Urban domestic pipeline.\n\nIn Investments, increased pro/fitability will be targeted through recycling of assets and redeployment of capital, increasing performance and transaction fees, achieving greater scale in the platform and reducing operating costs.\n\nThe Group has achieved strong early progress against its targets as it transitions to a higher performing, lower risk business. The focus for FY25 remains on execution of the refreshed strategy as the Group seeks to maximise securityholder returns as it further simpli/fies its operations and recycles capital.",

Securityholder equity plus gross debt less cash on balance sheet.\n- 5. The Group's assessment of market value.\n- 6. The Group's assessment of market value of ownership interests.\n\n## Performance 1\n\nThe Investments segment generated EBITDA of $174m, down 48 per cent on FY23 which bene/fitted from the divestment of 34 per cent of the US Military Housing Asset Management income stream. FY24 EBITDA was impacted by a /final provision of $58m taken against a receivable from the FY21 disposal of the US Telecommunications business, which followed a provision of $74m in FY23.\n\nManagement EBITDA, derived from funds and asset management fees was $113m, up 9 per cent on the prior year due to lower expenses that more than o/ffset the impact of lower average FUM. Management EBITDA margin increased to 41.5 per cent, up from 37.8 per cent in the prior year.\n\nCo-investment EBITDA of $124m was up 5 per cent from $118m. Stabilised investment yield of 3.5 per cent across the portfolio, increased from 3.1 per cent. Improved yields were seen across workplace, Retirement Living and retail assets.\n\nThe Group's total Investments segment capital of $3.8b decreased by 5 per cent and primarily relates to co-investments in funds managed by the Group. The co-investment portfolio at FY24 was $3.6b, down from $3.9b, following revaluation and foreign exchange impacts of $0.4b, asset divestments of $0.1b, including the sale of Darling Square retail in Sydney, and a further $0.2b of capital invested, mostly into APPF Retail.\n\nThe co-investment portfolio is well diversi/fied, with primary exposures across workplace, retail and residential as well as investments in retirement and industrial.\n\nOther EBITDA recorded a loss of $63m, including a /final $58m provision against the receivable from the disposal of the US Telecommunications business and the divestment of retail assets in FY24 at modest discounts to book value. Other EBITDA in FY23 bene/fitted primarily from US Military Housing transaction pro/fits.\n\n## Operations\n\nInvestments earnings are comprised of funds and assets under management contributions, co-investment portfolio yield and performance and transactions fees.\n\nFunds under management reduced by 2 per cent from $48.3b to $47.3b. Negative revaluations of $3.5b and largely retail divestments of $0.7b, were mostly o/ffset by FUM additions of $3.4b from the completion of several projects. These included The Exchange TRX in Kuala Lumpur, The Reed in Chicago and a data centre in Tokyo, as well as capital invested across APPF Commercial and several US assets.\n\nIn addition to current FUM, international development projects with capital partners are expected to add more than $6b in FUM over coming years, with $0.8b contributed in FY24 and a further $1.0b expected in FY25, including workplace developments the Forum, Boston; the Turing Building, London; and Paya Lebar Green, Singapore.\n\nAssets under management increased 3 per cent from $32.8b to $33.8b underpinned by the $1.5b completion of The Exchange TRX retail asset which opened during the year and is now more than 98 per cent leased. This was partially o/ffset by a number of retail divestments in the year.\n\nThe Group's co-investment portfolio of $3.6b is well diversi/fied with $1.0b in workplace, $1.0b in retail assets and $0.6b in residential, $0.5b in retirement and $0.5b across other asset classes, including industrial.\n\nThe Group intends to continue to grow its investment portfolio while targeting an average co-investment of 5-10 per cent of capital deployed, providing alignment with partners and continued exposure to operating leverage as the platform achieves greater scale.",

Project end value on product completed during a /financial period (representing 100% of project value).\n\n## Performance 1\n\nEBITDA of $509m was up from $283m in the prior year, including a $461m contribution from Urban projects.\n\nThe Development segment generated a ROIC of 5.0 per cent, up from 3.3 per cent in the prior year.\n\nKey drivers of the result included the completion of Residences One, One Sydney Harbour, generating $183m, a payment received relating to the San Francisco Bay Area project in the US, and $73m from the completion of TRX retail and residential projects, comprising a development gain of $39m and residential settlements of $34m. European projects also contributed positively, including the completion of Park & Sayer at Elephant Park and a land sale at Stratford Cross, each in London. The downward revaluation of the Victoria Cross Over Station development in North Sydney negatively impacted earnings by $57m.\n\nThe Communities business generated EBITDA of $48m, compared with $142m in the prior year which bene/fitted from higher margin settlements and the sale of industrial land parcels. Settlements of 2,237 for the year were down marginally from 2,253 while sales of 1,721 were down 2 per cent. Operating performance for the Communities business was impacted by delays, resulting in the deferral of higher margin settlements.\n\nThe sale of 12 Communities projects was announced in 1H24 with the expected transfer of ownership being delayed from 2H24 to FY25, pending a decision from the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC), anticipated on 12 September 2024. Due to the delay, $40m of FY24 EBITDA, equating to $28m of OPAT, was booked in FY24 which would otherwise have been part of the sale.\n\nThere were $8.2b of completions during the year including Residences One, One Sydney Harbour; Melbourne Quarter Tower; retail and residential product at TRX in Kuala Lumpur; residential product in New York, Chicago and London; and a life sciences building and data centre, both in Asia.\n\nThere were $1.9b of commencements including build to sell apartments at Elephant Park, London, and Victoria Harbour, Melbourne.\n\nLeasing was achieved across workplace assets including Victoria Cross Over Station development and Town Hall Place in Melbourne.\n\nInvested capital reduced from $6.1 b to $5.9b, with capital released from the completion of Residences One, One Sydney Harbour, being mostly o/ffset by development production across other large projects including: Residences Two and Watermans Residences, One Sydney Harbour; The Exchange TRX; One Circular Quay; as well as production in the Australian Communities business.\n\n## Operations\n\nWork in Progress of $14.5b decreased from $22.9b on the prior year, due to project completions of $8.2b and $2.1b of other adjustments, including projects removed from WIP resulting from strategy related impacts, partially o/ffset by commencements of $1.9b.\n\nThe FY24 development pipeline re/flects movements within the year and impacts from the strategy update, and comprises:\n\n- \u00b7 $11.8b of Australian Urban development opportunities\n- \u00b7 $15.1b of Communities projects, including $11.9b held for sale\n- \u00b7 $8.8b of international joint venture projects, including more than $6b of potential investment product to be completed; and\n- \u00b7 $57.4b of primarily land management agreements in Europe.\n\nThe primary impact to the development pipeline, which reduced from $124.3b to $93.1b, was the removal of the San Francisco Bay Area Project.\n\nDevelopment origination is solely focussed on Australia, with the existing Urban pipeline of $11.8b comprising $7.5b of WIP and $4.3b of master planned and in-conversion projects. Origination wins this year included $1.3b of new work secured relating to the Gurrowa Place project at Queen Victoria Market in Melbourne.\n\nThe Group remains well positioned to further originate development projects across mixed-use, residential and workplace assets, leveraging its market leading placemaking capabilities.",

Construction revenue to be earned in future periods (excludes internal projects).\n\n## Performance 1\n\nThe Construction segment delivered EBITDA of $126m, up 40 per cent on the prior year. A gain from the remeasurement of UK pension scheme liabilities and an improved contribution from Asia was partially o/ffset by a lower contribution from Australia. Revenue of $5.9b was down 18 per cent. This was driven by reduced activity across all regions, with the largest revenue contributor, Australia, the least impacted, down 7 per cent to $3.4b. The US contributed to more than half of the revenue decline, following the earlier wind down of West Coast and Central US operations.\n\nSocial infrastructure remained the key driver of revenue, up 3 per cent on the prior year at $2.3b. Other revenue categories were impacted by lower activity levels, particularly, residential, which decreased 47 per cent following a decision to no longer build external apartments for sale or construction projects below $150m in value.\n\nThe EBITDA margin was 2.1 per cent, up from 1.2 per cent, with the gain from the remeasurement of the UK de/fined pension scheme contributing 0.7 percentage points. Australia's EBITDA margin was 1.7 per cent, down from 2.8 per cent, due primarily to supplier insolvencies on Australian projects, requiring re-tendering for various goods and services. The estimate of the impact in FY24 of those insolvencies was in the order of $50m.\n\nNew work secured was $4.8b, up 2 per cent on the prior year. A recovery in European activity led the growth, contributing $1.1b, while the US and Australia were the largest components. Social infrastructure projects remain the key sector for new work secured at $2.3b, followed by workplace at $1.1b.\n\nThe Construction business is preferred for $15.3b in new projects, including $5.1b of social infrastructure projects, $4.7b of Defence and $2.9b of workplace, supporting the future pipeline of new work.\n\nA considerable proportion of the customer base is repeat business from deep and trusted relationships with government and corporate clients.\n\n## Operations\n\nBacklog revenue reduced 12 per cent to $7.6b, led by a $1.8b decline in the Australian backlog. This was partly o/ffset by a $0.6b increase in UK backlog, while the US and Asia remained broadly stable.\n\nAustralia's backlog revenue of $3.9b is weighted to social infrastructure and defence projects and is supported by a strong preferred book of $10.6b, providing visibility on future revenues. Key projects underway include the Frankston Hospital Redevelopment, various Australian Department of Defence projects, Powerhouse Parramatta and Liverpool Health and Academic Precinct.\n\nThe US backlog revenue of $2.6b is expected to reduce signi/ficantly in line with the wind down of West Coast and Central operations and terms agreed in principle for the sale of the East Coast construction operations.\n\nThe UK construction business has backlog revenue of $1.0b and is supported by a preferred book of $4.4b. The business is being prepared for sale, in line with the decision to divest international construction operations.",

Key movements included a reduction of Inventories from the reclassi/fication of the 12 Communities projects held for sale, partially o/ffset by increased production costs capitalised on Watermans Residences, One Sydney Harbour. The increase in Equity accounted investment assets predominantly relate to equity contributions to development projects including One Sydney Harbour, The Exchange TRX, Habitat in Los Angeles, and Victoria Cross Over Station development, partially o/ffset by settlements received from Residences One, One Sydney Harbour following completion.\n\n## Other assets and liabilities\n\nThe movement in Other assets and liabilities includes impairment of goodwill, deferred tax balances and other charges required to implement the revised strategy, alongside timing di/fferences in receivables and payables across Development and Construction activities.\n\n## Cash /flow and treasury management\n\nThe Group commenced the /financial year with cash and cash equivalents of $0.9b. Movements during the year comprised Operating cash out/flow of $0.1b, Investing cash out/flow of $0.6b and Financing cash in/flow of $0.7b. The Group closed the year with cash and cash equivalents of $1.0b.\n\nCore operating cash out/flows included production spend on development projects on balance sheet including Watermans Residences at One Sydney Harbour, and Communities.\n\nInvesting cash out/flows during the year included production spend on key development joint venture projects including Residences Two, One Sydney Harbour, The Exchange TRX, Habitat and Victoria Cross Over Station development, along with further equity contributions to APPF Retail.\n\nThe Group remains in a strong position with $2.2b of committed liquidity comprising $1.0b of cash and cash equivalents and $1.2b in available undrawn debt. Average debt maturity of 3.4 years has reduced following the further buy-back of longer dated Sterling bonds in 1H24.\n\nGearing of 21 per cent at year end was modestly above the target range of 10-20 per cent, however, includes a 1 per cent impact as a consequence of the impairments and charges recorded following the May 2024 strategy update. Following a year of peak development capex, there is a clear pathway to deleveraging, with $2.4b of contracted and anticipated cash /flows expected to be received following the sale of 12 Communities projects, the sale of life sciences interests in Asia to establish a new Asia Paci/fic joint venture, the sale of the US Military Housing business and expected settlements at One Sydney Harbour.\n\n## Treasury management\n\nFY23\n\nFY24\n\nVar.\n\n| Net debt                          | $m    | 2,381   | 3,176   | 33%   |\n|-----------------------------------|-------|---------|---------|-------|\n| Gearing 1                         | %     | 14.8    | 21.1    | 43%   |\n| Interest cover 2                  | times | 3.0     | 2.7     | (10%) |\n| Average cost of debt              | %     | 4.3     | 5.4     | 26%   |\n| Average drawn debt maturity       | years | 4.4     | 3.4     | (23%) |\n| Available liquidity               | $m    | 2,581   | 2,159   | (16%) |\n| Average debt mix /fixed:/floating | $m    | 64:36   | 43:57   | NM    |\n\n- 1.

The tone is 'set at the top' and Board members believe that meeting with our people, in addition to information received in formal meetings on the organisation's culture, is an important element of reinforcing the Lendlease values. The Board members meet regularly with local teams and in FY24, this occurred in the UK and Australia.\n\nThe Board program whether in Australia or o/ffshore, typically comprises formal meetings and additional business brie/fings, presentations from internal and external sources, project site visits, employee events and meetings with key stakeholders. In FY24, in recognition of the need to move to a leaner and more focussed organisation, the Board's regional program shifted so that the international trips occur on an annual basis. These are scheduled in each of the regions where Lendlease operates on a rotational basis.\n\nThe Board views that these program activities - in addition to the formal, scheduled Board and Committee meetings - are important for Board\n\nmembers to receive a greater understanding of our people and our business and a deep understanding of the activities and operations. The Chair works with the Company Secretary to plan the yearly program. Depending on the time of year, the program runs for a minimum of two days and up to /five days where more detailed project reviews are required.\n\nIn FY24, the Board engagement program included:\n\n## Europe\n\n- \u00b7 Received a brie/fing from a major Lendlease capital partner on their views on global real estate investment (October 2023)\n- \u00b7 Received a brie/fing from the UK based Board advisor on the political and economic landscape in the UK (October 2023)\n- \u00b7 Engagement with Europe Regional Leadership Team (October 2023)\n- \u00b7 Town Hall with Europe regional employees (October 2023)\n- \u00b7 Hosted a round table discussion on topics relevant to the London real estate and investments market (October 2023).\n\n## Australia\n\n- \u00b7 Engagement with regional business leaders to provide updates and overview of key regional business issues\n- \u00b7 Review of the Melbourne Metro Project followed by a site visit (November 2023)\n- \u00b7 Review of the Melbourne Quarter precinct followed by a site visit (November 2023)\n- \u00b7 Site visit to One Sydney Harbour Residences One (February 2024)\n- \u00b7 Deep dive review of the Queen Victoria Market project (May 2024)\n- \u00b7 Review of Docklands Projects followed by a site visit (May 2024)\n- \u00b7 Continued engagement throughout the year with the Global Leadership Team (February 2024 and May 2024)\n- \u00b7 Town Hall with Australia regional employees (November 2023).",

No fatalities were reported in FY24.\n- \u00b7 Oversighted the progress of the revised health and safety strategy which addresses the '3Ps', being Physical Safety, Product Safety and Psychological Safety.\n- \u00b7 Monitored lead and lag indicator targets to measure broader safety performance in FY24 to create a Lendlease Safety Index.\n- \u00b7 Reviewed the overall external reporting de/finitions to align with the Group's Investment led strategy.\n- \u00b7 Continued to receive reports on Critical Incidents, investigation /findings and the actions to close out these incidents.\n- \u00b7 Continued to receive quarterly updates on project metrics which are treated as a leading indicator of safety risk.\n- \u00b7 Received a report on the roll out of the Psychological Safety Workshops held across all regions.\n- \u00b7 Endorsed a Group wide approach to Engineered Stone Benchtop requirements and installation in line with SafeWork Australia recommendations.\n- \u00b7 Received a report on global safety initiatives such as 'Stop the Drops' to reduce critical incident exposure to fall of materials.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Financial\n\n## Material Issue:\n\nDelivering securityholder returns.

The key outcomes for the new direction included:\n- - Refocussing the business towards the Australia market and maintaining and growing the international Investments platform.\n- - Simplifying structures to support the business segments of Investments, Development and Construction.\n- \u00b7 Ongoing monitoring and review of Treasury management was a key focus area to ensure that Lendlease remains within the target gearing ranges and maintains investment grade credit ratings.\n- \u00b7 Concluded the audit tender process in accordance with the Group's Audit Tender Policy. Given uncertainties in the professional services market and the extent of change across the Group, a decision was made to retain KPMG until the end of FY27. Owing to the current dynamics in the Australian consultancy sector, this was agreed to be the optimum path for our business.\n- \u00b7 Continued to consider project approvals in the context of the Portfolio Management Framework, with the object to maximising long-term securityholder value.",

The Risk Committee also has the role of considering, and if approved, recommending to the Board for approval major transactions as referred to the Committee by the Global Investment Committee.\n\n## Sustainability Committee\n\nThe Sustainability Committee assists the Board in monitoring the decisions and actions of management in achieving Lendlease's aspiration to be a sustainable organisation. The Committee has oversight of health and safety, ESG matters, the Lendlease Foundation, modern slavery and the Group's Elevate RAP.\n\n## Nominations Committee\n\nThe Nominations Committee has responsibility for Board renewal, composition and Director development and oversees the reviews of Board, Committee and Director performance.\n\nIn response to the strategy refresh, a review of the committee structures will be undertaken in FY25.",

        "page_content": "## Remuneration Report\n\n## Message from the Board\n\nIt has been a challenging year for Lendlease, with rising costs, industry shifts, and a persistent market downturn impacting the global sector and slowing the pace of capital recycling. Our signi/ficant investments outside of Australia have not yielded the near-term returns our securityholders expect.\n\nIn light of these obstacles, the Board and the Corporate Leadership Team (CLT) have chosen to streamline and refocus our e/fforts. We're simplifying our organisational structure, reducing our costs, focusing on our market-leading Australian business, and enhancing our international investment platform. Additionally, we're aiming to release $4.5b of capital by moving away from international construction and fasttracking the release of capital from our overseas projects and other holdings. To facilitate this strategic shift, we've made a post-tax provision of $1.4b for FY24, contributing to a Group Statutory Loss after Tax of $1.5b.\n\nWe recognise that these outcomes are disappointing. The Board and the Group CEO take accountability for the company's performance, and are committed to turning it around.\n\nSince the announcement of targeted business divestiture plans, Lendlease has already made progress toward the new strategy, including:\n\n- \u00b7 Restructuring the organisation by removing regional management structures;\n- \u00b7 Announcing key business sales in Asia, Australia and Americas; and\n- \u00b7 Progressing the ongoing sale of the remaining stake in Keyton retirement living platform, as well as interests in The Exchange TRX commercial assets in Malaysia.\n\n## In year outcomes\n\nLendlease has had a productive year with $8.2b of Development completions and $1.9b of new project commencements, such as build-to-sell apartments in London and Melbourne.\n\nOur Core Operating Pro/fit After Tax (OPAT) increased modestly to $263m, delivering Earnings per Security of 38.1 cents, and Return on Equity of 4.4 per cent. Distributions per Security totalled 16 cents compared to 16 cents in FY23. This represents a payout ratio of 42 per cent of OPAT.\n\nThe Short-Term Award (STA) Scorecard outcome for FY24 was at 58% of target, including commendable Safety and\n\nSustainability outcomes. However, in light of the continued decline in securityholder experience, the Board determined to reduce FY24 STA payments for the Group CEO and the Corporate Leadership Team (CLT) to zero.\n\nThe exercise of discretion in this manner is prudent, re/flects the securityholder experience, and recognises the accountability of the CLT for the performance of the Group as a whole. We note the Group CEO supported this decision.\n\nFor Long-Term Award (LTA) subject to performance measurement at the end of FY24, performance did not meet the required thresholds set by the Board.  Consequently, there was nil vesting.\n\n## Strike response\n\nAt the November 2023 Annual General Meeting we received a /first strike, with approximately 40% of securityholders voting against the FY23 Remuneration Report.\n\nFeedback from securityholders and proxy advisors highlighted key concerns as performance and reward alignment, disclosure transparency and remuneration quantum.\n\nAlthough this outcome was disappointing, the Board has carefully considered stakeholder feedback and has taken the following actions to address key concerns:\n\n- \u00b7 Exercised downward discretion to award zero FY24 STA to the CLT, including the Group CEO;\n- \u00b7 Suspended the FY25 STA plan;\n- \u00b7 Developed a temporary Transformation Award for FY25;\n- \u00b7 Applied zero /fixed remuneration increase to KMP in FY24; and\n- \u00b7 Amended the LTA measures and weighting to improve focus on securityholder returns.\n\nThese actions have been implemented alongside the strategic refocus. Our expectation is that by successfully executing the new strategy, we will strengthen our market position and realign executive remuneration with market benchmarks.\n\nFor further detail regarding our response to the strike, please refer to page 72.\n\n## FY25 Transformation Award\n\nWe believe the Executive Remuneration Strategy (ERS) remains /fit for purpose in a 'business as usual' context, but a di/fferent approach is needed to ensure\n\nalignment with securityholders in the short-term. While we believe executives should be rewarded for successfully implementing the strategy, this should only occur to the extent that performance drives real gains to securityholders, via an improvement in the security price.\n\nTo this end, we have developed a temporary Transformation Award, delivered in options, with vesting contingent on achieving a signi/ficant improvement in security price after two-years. We believe this timeframe is appropriate to link to measurable securityholder outcomes.\n\nFurther detail will be provided in the FY24 Notice of Meeting and the FY25 Remuneration Report.\n\n## Changes to Key Management Personnel\n\nAs part of the reorganisation, the role of Chief Risk O/fficer (CRO) has been discontinued e/ffective 30 June 2024.  As a result, the CRO will no longer be a KMP in FY25.\n\nCommencing 1 July 2024, we have welcomed two new faces to our leadership team: Tom Mackellar as CEO Development, and Penny Ransom as Chief Investment O/fficer (CIO).\n\nWe also welcomed Barbara Kno/flach who joined the Lendlease Board of Directors e/ffective 1 October 2023.\n\n## Looking ahead\n\nOver FY25 we will continue to consider the appropriateness of the ERS, both in the context of the business turnaround, and returning to business as usual.\n\nWe appreciate the patience, support and feedback we have received from securityholders over this challenging time and acknowledge the trust we hold in steering Lendlease to a brighter future.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nM J Ullmer, AO\n\nChairman\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nElizabeth Proust, AO\n\nChairman, People & Culture Committee",

However, it needs to be acknowledged that Lendlease remains a globally signi/ficant company operating in a complex environment where our talent is highly sought.\n\nThe new strategy is intended to support a recovery in security price, bringing Lendlease back closer with the ASX50 remuneration benchmark at which current structures were originally set.\n\n## Disclosure transparency\n\nLendlease will continue to improve the quality of disclosure around remuneration decisions, performance measures and targets in publishing our Remuneration Report and the Notice of Meeting (NOM). For example, Lendlease will provide detailed design and key performance conditions underpinning the Transformation Award that will replace the STA plan for Group CEO and KMP in FY25.\n\nIt is also highlighted that LTA weighting on Relative TSR increased to 50 per cent and is set with greater levels of stretch compared to the prevailing market approach. The Relative TSR hurdle is dislcosed in the Remuneration Report, and the Statutory ROE hurdle will remain retrospectively disclosed at vesting.\n\nremuneration framework that balances short and long-term business performance, with signi/ficant focus on alignment of reward to securityholder experience via the delivery of equity.\n\nHowever, the Board also recognises Lendlease's current environment and context, including poor security price performance and securityholder returns as a result of structural challenges and a prolonged market downturn.  From this perspective, the Board acknowledged that the FY25 framework requires greater focus and link to security price recovery and the delivery of the turnaround strategy.",

Growth in FUM was replaced with an Investments Return on Invested Capital (IM ROIC) measure from FY24 onwards.\n\n## Adjustment to Denis Hickey's Incentive Award\n\n## GDV performance adjustment\n\nIn FY22, Denis Hickey was issued a one-o/ff incentive aligned to key delivery milestones under the Google Development Ventures (GDV) project over a 3-year performance period from 1 July 2021 to 30 June 2024. At the time of grant, this incentive re/flected the criticality and scope of the GDV project.\n\nThe Board retains an overarching discretion to reduce or forfeit any unvested awards if it considers that the vesting of the awards would result in receipt of a bene/fit that was unwarranted or inappropriate.\n\nIn FY23, the Board exercised discretion to carry out an interim assessment on the GDV performance hurdles relating to FY22 (Year 1) and FY23 (Year 2) project key milestones. The Board determined that 51% of the total GDV Incentive award would lapse based on past milestone outcomes during FY22 and FY23.\n\nIn FY24, the Board reviewed the remaining 49% GDV Incentive milestones, and in consideration of the cancellation of the GDV project and surrounding circumstances, determined the /final vesting outcome be zero.",

The Company is deemed to control LLT for accounting purposes and therefore LLT is consolidated into the Group's /financial report. The issued units of LLT, however, are not owned by the Company and are therefore presented separately in the consolidated entity Statement of Financial Position within equity, notwithstanding that the unitholders of LLT are also the shareholders of the Company.\n\nThe consolidated /financial report was authorised for issue by the Directors on 19 August 2024.",

At June 2024, all values have been rounded o/ff to the nearest million dollars unless otherwise indicated, in accordance with ASIC Corporations (Rounding in Financial/Directors' Reports) Instrument 2016/191\n- \u00b7 Is prepared under the historical cost basis except for the following assets and liabilities, which are stated at their fair value: derivative /financial instruments, fair value through pro/fit or loss investments, investment properties, and liabilities for cash settled share based compensation plans. Recognised assets and liabilities that are hedged are stated at fair value in respect of the risk that is hedged. Refer to the speci/fic accounting policies within the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the basis of valuation of assets and liabilities measured at fair value.\n\nMaterial accounting policies have been:\n\n- \u00b7 Included in the relevant notes to which the policies relate, while other material accounting policies are discussed in Note 38 'Other Material Accounting Policies'\n- \u00b7 Consistently applied to all /financial years presented in the consolidated /financial statements and by all entities in the Group, except as explained in Note 37 'Impact of New and Revised Accounting Standards'.\n\nThe preparation of a /financial report that complies with AASBs requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions.\n\n- \u00b7 This can a/ffect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may di/ffer from these estimates\n- \u00b7 Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to estimates are recognised prospectively\n- \u00b7 The material accounting policies highlight information about accounting judgements in applying accounting policies that have the most signi/ficant e/ffects on reported amounts and further information about estimated uncertainties that have a signi/ficant risk of resulting in material adjustments within the next /financial year\n- \u00b7 The Group considers the following as material accounting estimates and judgements:\n- - Revenue recognition. Refer to Note 4 'Revenue from Contracts with Customers' for further detail\n- - Recoverability of inventories. Refer to Note 11 'Inventories' for further detail\n- - Asset valuation. Refer to Note 12 'Equity Accounted Investments', Note 13 'Other Financial Assets' and Note 26 'Fair Value Measurement' for further detail\n- - Recoverability of goodwill in relation to the overseas construction businesses. Refer to Note 32 'Intangible Assets' for further detail\n- - Provision estimation in relation to the UK building remediation. Refer to Note 23 'Provisions' for further detail\n- - The contingent liability in relation to the Retirement Living tax matter. Refer to Note 27 'Contingent Liabilities' for further detail\n- \u00b7 These material accounting estimates and judgements have been considered in the context of the current economic conditions.\n\nThe Group presents assets and liabilities in the Statement of Financial Position as current or non current.\n\n- \u00b7 Current assets include assets held primarily for trading purposes, cash and cash equivalents, and assets expected to be realised in, or intended for sale or use in, the course of the Group's operating cycle or within the next 12 months. All other assets are classi/fied as non current\n- \u00b7 Current liabilities include liabilities held primarily for trading purposes, liabilities expected to be settled in the course of the Group's operating cycle and those liabilities due within one year from the reporting date. All other liabilities are classi/fied as non current.\n\nOn 27 May 2024 the Group announced a strategy update with key actions to simplify the organisational structure, exit international construction and accelerate the release of capital from its o/ffshore development project and assets. Financial impacts include impairment charges on Goodwill and Development projects and other related costs to accelerate the release of capital. These impacts have been disclosed in the relevant notes to the consolidated /financial statements.\n\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared on a going concern basis. In preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements, including assessing the going concern basis of accounting, the Group has considered the general market conditions.\n\nThe Group has:\n\n- \u00b7 $1,159 million in undrawn facilities. See Note 16 'Borrowings and Financing Arrangements'\n- \u00b7 $350 million in undrawn uncommitted facilities maturing October 2024. See Note 16 'Borrowings and Financing Arrangements'\n- \u00b7 $1,000 million in cash and cash equivalents. See Note 14 'Cash and Cash Equivalents'.\n\nFollowing this assessment, the Group is well placed to manage its /financing and future commitments over the next 12 months from the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements.",

        "page_content": "## Section A. Performance\n\nIn addition to the statutory result, Operating Earnings before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortisation (Operating EBITDA) and Operating Pro/fit after Tax (Operating PAT) are the key measures used to assess the Group's performance. This section of the Financial Report focuses on disclosure that enhances a user's understanding of Operating EBITDA and Operating PAT. Segment Reporting below provides a breakdown of pro/fit and revenue by the operational activity and region. The key line items of the Income Statement, along with their components, provide detail behind the reported balances. Group performance will also impact the earnings per stapled security and dividend payout, therefore disclosure on these items has been included in this section. Further information and analysis on performance and allocation of resources can be found in the Performance and Outlook section of the Directors' Report.\n\n## 1. Segment Reporting\n\n## Accounting Policies\n\nThe Group's segments are Investments, Development, Construction and Non core. The Group has identi/fied these operating segments based on the distinct products and services provided by each segment, the distinct target return pro/file and allocation of resources for each segment, and internal reports that are reviewed and used by the Group Chief Executive O/fficer and Managing Director (the Chief Operating Decision Maker) in assessing performance, determining the allocation of resources, setting operational targets, and managing the Group.\n\nThe Group has presented the segments around business activity due to the Group's business model being broadly consistent in all regions. Additional disclosure has also been included for Operating EBITDA, Operating PAT and Statutory Pro/fit by region.\n\nThe Group reports Operating EBITDA and Operating PAT as its primary earnings metrics, in addition to the statutory result. Operating PAT is de/fined as Statutory pro/fit adjusted for Investment property revaluations (including in Other /financial assets and Equity accounted investments) that are classi/fied in the Investment segment, and material one-o/ff items that could not reasonably have been expected to arise from normal operations. Operating EBITDA is before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortisation. Operating EBITDA and Operating PAT includes revaluation increases or decreases of Investment properties under construction that are classi/fied in the Development segment.\n\nThe Chief Operating Decision Maker receives information and assesses segment performance under these metrics. Operating EBITDA and Operating PAT are used to measure performance as management believes that such information is the most relevant in evaluating the results of certain reportable segments relative to other entities that operate within these industries. The Group does not consider corporate activities to be an operating segment.\n\nThe operating segments are as follows:\n\n## Investments\n\nOperates across all four geographic regions. Services include owning and/or managing investments. The segment includes an investment management platform and the Group's ownership interests in residential, o/ffice, retail, industrial, retirement and infrastructure investment assets.\n\n## Development\n\nOperates in all four geographic regions. Its products and services include the development of inner city mixed use developments, apartments, communities, retirement, retail, commercial assets and social and economic infrastructure. Construction margin earned on development projects is recognised in this segment.\n\n## Construction\n\nOperates across all four geographic regions. Its products and services include the provision of project management, design and construction services, predominantly in the commercial, residential, mixed use, defence and social infrastructure sectors.\n\n## Non core\n\nNon core includes the provision of project management, design and construction services in the Australian infrastructure sector. These products and services represent the retained Engineering and retained Services projects. The discontinued operations referenced throughout the /financial statements are included in this segment. Discontinued operations represent the Engineering and Services businesses sold in previous periods, excluding the projects retained by the Group.\n\nIn May 2024 a revised strategy was announced. There is no impact to operating segments reported on for the year ended 30 June 2024. New structures and processes that will support the strategy were implemented from 1 July 2024.  Details of the strategy are outlined in the Performance and Outlook section of the Directors' Report.",

This is a key performance measure for the Group. Refer to further details in the Managing and Measuring Value - Financial section of this Annual Report.\n\nBasic EPS/EPSS is determined by dividing Pro/fit/(loss) after tax attributable to members of the Company and Group (excluding any costs of servicing equity other than ordinary shares/securities) by the weighted average number of ordinary shares/securities outstanding during the /financial year, adjusted for bonus elements in ordinary shares/securities issued during the /financial year.\n\nDiluted EPS/EPSS is determined by adjusting the Pro/fit/(loss) after tax attributable to members of the Company and Group, and the weighted average number of ordinary shares/securities outstanding for the e/ffects of all dilutive potential ordinary shares/ securities. The Group currently does not have any dilutive potential ordinary shares/securities. Dilution occurs when treasury shares and employee share options are included in outstanding shares.\n\nThe issued units of Lendlease Trust (LLT) are presented separately within equity, and therefore the pro/fit attributable to LLT is excluded from the calculation of basic and diluted earnings per Company share presented in the Income Statement.\n\n|                                                                          |       | June 2024                                            | June 2024                     | June 2023                                            | June 2023                     |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------|------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|\n|                                                                          |       | Shares/  Securities  Excluding  Treasury  Securities | Shares/  Securities on  Issue | Shares/  Securities  Excluding  Treasury  Securities | Shares/  Securities on  Issue |\n| Basic/Diluted Earnings Per Share (EPS)                                   |       |                                                      |                               |                                                      |                               |\n| Loss attributable to members of Lendlease Corporation  Limited (Company) | $m    | (1,461)                                              | (1,461)                       | (278)                                                | (278)                         |\n| Weighted average number of ordinary shares                               | m     | 683                                                  | 690                           | 683                                                  | 689                           |\n| Basic/Diluted EPS                                                        | cents | (213.9)                                              | (211.7)                       | (40.7)                                               | (40.3)                        |\n| Basic/Diluted Earnings Per Stapled Security (EPSS)                       |       |                                                      |                               |                                                      |                               |\n| Loss attributable to securityholders of Lendlease Group                  | $m    | (1,502)                                              | (1,502)                       | (232)                                                | (232)                         |\n| Weighted average number of stapled securities                            | m     | 683                                                  | 690                           | 683                                                  | 689                           |\n| Basic/Diluted EPSS 1                                                     | cents | (219.9)                                              | (217.7)                       | (34.0)                                               | (33.7)                        |\n\n- 1.

Revenue from Contracts with Customers\n\n## Accounting Policies\n\n## Construction and Development services\n\nConstruction services include project management, design and construction services predominantly in the commercial, residential, mixed use, defence and social infrastructure sectors. Development services include development fees earned on development of inner city mixed use developments, retirement, retail, commercial assets and social and economic infrastructure.\n\nContracts with customers to provide Construction or Development services can include either one performance obligation or multiple performance obligations within each contract. The Group assesses each of its contracts individually and where there are separate performance obligations identi/fied, the transaction price is allocated based on the relative standalone selling prices of the services provided. Typically, the Construction or Development services in contracts are not considered distinct as the services are highly interrelated and an integrated bundle of services and therefore are accounted for as a single performance obligation.\n\nThe transaction price for each contract may include variable consideration in the form of contract variations or modi/fications, and contract claims (collectively, 'Modi/fications'). Variable consideration may also include performance or other incentive fees. The transaction price is the amount of consideration to which the Group expects to be entitled to receive in exchange for transferring promised goods or services to a customer per the contract.\n\nVariable consideration is only included in the transaction price for a contract to the extent it is highly probable that a signi/ficant reversal of that revenue will not occur, which is an area of accounting judgement. Factors considered in assessing whether the estimated revenue associated with Modi/fications should be recognised include the following:\n\n- i. Status of negotiations with customers\n- ii. The contract or other evidence provides a legal basis for the Modi/fications\n- iii. Additional costs incurred were caused by circumstances that were unforeseen at the contract date and for which entitlement contractually exists\n- iv. Modi/fication related costs are identi/fiable, measurable, and considered reasonable in view of the work performed\n- v. Evidence supporting the Modi/fication is objective and veri/fiable, which may include independent third-party advice\n- vi. Commercial and market factors speci/fic to the Modi/fications\n- vii. Historical experience in resolving Modi/fications.\n\nThis assessment is reviewed each reporting period or when facts and circumstances change during the reporting period.\n\nRevenue is recognised over time, typically based on an input method using an estimate of costs incurred to date as a percentage of total estimated costs. These contracts are typically executed on the customer's land so they control the assets as they are being built or the customer bene/fits from the service as the work is performed. Di/fferences between amounts recognised as revenue and amounts billed to customers are recognised as contract assets or liabilities in the Statement of Financial Position.\n\nThe measurement of revenue is an area of accounting judgement. Management uses judgement to estimate:\n\n- i. Progress in satisfying the performance obligations within the contract, which includes estimating contract costs expected to be incurred to satisfy performance obligations\n- ii. The probability of the amount to be recognised as variable consideration for approved variations and claims where the /final price has not been agreed with the customer.\n\nRevenue is invoiced based on the terms of each individual contract, which may include a periodic billing schedule or achievement of speci/fic milestones. Invoices are issued under commercial payment terms which are typically 30 days from when an invoice is issued.\n\nA provision for loss making contracts is recorded for the di/fference between the expected costs of ful/filling a contract and the expected remaining economic bene/fits to be received where the forecast remaining costs exceed the forecast remaining bene/fits.\n\n## Investment services\n\nInvestment services include funds management, asset management, leasing and origination services.\n\nEach contract with a customer to provide Investment services is typically one performance obligation with revenue recognised over time as services are rendered. Typically, our performance obligation is to manage a client's capital and/or property for a speci/fied period of time and is delivered as a series of daily performance obligations over time.\n\nThe transaction price for each contract may include variable consideration in the form of performance fees. Variable consideration is only included in the transaction price for a contract to the extent it is highly probable that a signi/ficant reversal of that revenue will not occur. The Group assesses probability of receiving variable consideration using a combination of commercial and market factors, and historical experience.\n\nRevenue is invoiced either monthly or quarterly based on the terms of each individual contract. Invoices are issued under commercial payment terms which are typically 30 days from when an invoice is issued.",

        "page_content": "## Accounting Policies continued\n\n## Sale of Development Properties\n\nThe Group develops and sells residential land lots and built form products, including residential apartments, commercial and retail buildings. Sales of residential land lots and apartments typically are recognised at a point in time, with each contract treated as a single performance obligation to transfer control of an asset to a customer. Residential land lots and apartments are recognised on settlement with the customer.\n\nThe sale of retail, commercial and mixed use assets may include land, construction, development management and investment service components. Where there are multiple components within one contract, the transaction price is allocated based on the standalone selling prices of each component, typically using the residual approach, and revenue is recognised based on the policies noted above. Sales of commercial and retail buildings are recognised when the customer obtains control of the asset based on the speci/fic terms and conditions of the sales contract.\n\nThe Group discounts deferred proceeds to re/flect the time value of money where the period between the transfer of control of a development property and receipt of payment from the customer exceeds one year. Deferred proceeds from customers are recognised in trade and other receivables where the right to receive payment is unconditional. Deposits received in advance from customers are recognised as a contract liability until the performance obligation has been met.\n\nThe measurement of revenue from the sale of development properties is an area of accounting judgement as it requires management to exercise judgement in valuing the individual components of a development property sale, given the due consideration to cost inputs, market conditions and commercial factors. The recognition and determination of when control passes requires management judgement and is considered an area of accounting judgement.\n\nProceeds from the sale of residential land lots and apartments are received upon settlement, which typically occurs between 6-12 weeks following practical completion on the asset. Proceeds from the sale of retail, commercial and mixed use assets are received in accordance with the speci/fic terms of each contract.\n\nThe Group may enter a PLLACes (Presold Lendlease Apartment Cash Flows) transaction for certain residential apartment buildings from time to time. This involves the Group receiving an upfront cash in/flow from third party investors (investors) in exchange for selling the investors the rights to the cash proceeds that are due from customers once the apartments are completed. When customers settle their apartments the Group does not receive any cash proceeds nor does it pay any amounts to the investors as the customers pay the investors directly. On entry into a PLLACes transaction the cash in/flow is disclosed as an operating cash in/flow in the Statement of Cash Flows which typically occurs over a year in advance of the revenue recognition from the sale of the apartments. At the same time, an Other payables - PLLACes is also recognised within Trade and Other Payables and is derecognised as revenue once settlement of the apartments occurs.\n\n|                                                 | June 2024 $m   | June 2023 $m   |\n|-------------------------------------------------|----------------|----------------|\n| Revenue from the provision of services          |                |                |\n| Core Construction services                      | 5,915          | 7,191          |\n| Non core Construction services                  | 429            | 499            |\n| Construction services                           | 6,344          | 7,690          |\n| Investment services                             | 253            | 261            |\n| Development services                            | 1,472          | 1,483          |\n| Total revenue from the provision of services    | 8,069          | 9,434          |\n| Revenue from the sale of development properties | 1,149          | 795            |\n| Total revenue from contracts with customers 1   | 9,218          | 10,229         |\n\n- 1.

Share of Pro/fit of Equity Accounted Investments\n\n## Accounting Policies\n\nInvestments in associates and joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method. The share of pro/fit recognised under the equity method is the Group's share of the investment's pro/fit or loss based on ownership interest held. Associates (including partnerships) are entities in which the Group, as a result of its voting rights, has signi/ficant in/fluence, but not control or joint control, over the /financial and operating policies. A joint venture is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to the net assets of the arrangement.\n\nFor associates, this is from the date that signi/ficant in/fluence commences until the date that signi/ficant in/fluence ceases, and for joint ventures, this is from the date joint control commences until the date joint control ceases.\n\n|                                                        | Note   | June 2024 $m   | June 2023 $m   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------|--------|----------------|----------------|\n| Associates 1,2                                         |        |                |                |\n| Share of pro/fit                                       | 12.a   | 5              | 11             |\n| Joint Ventures 1,2                                     |        |                |                |\n| Share of pro/fit                                       | 12.b   | 134            | 17             |\n| Total share of pro/fit of equity accounted investments |        | 139            | 28             |\n\n## 6.

        "page_content": "## 7. Other Expenses\n\n## Accounting Policies\n\nOther expenses in general are recognised as incurred.\n\n## Employee Bene/fit Expenses\n\nEmployee bene/fits are expensed as the related service by the employee is provided and includes both equity and cash based payment transactions. Employee bene/fits recognised in the Income Statement are net of recoveries.\n\nFor cash bonuses, the Group recognises an accrued liability for the amount expected to be paid. This is based on a formula that takes into consideration the pro/fit attributable to the Group's securityholders after certain adjustments. Refer to Note 35a 'Short Term Incentive (STI)' for further detail.\n\n## Share Based Compensation\n\nThe Group operates equity settled share based compensation plans that are linked to Lendlease's security price. The fair value of the equity received in exchange for the grant is recognised as an expense and a corresponding increase in equity, in the Equity Compensation Reserve. The total amount to be expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of the securities granted.\n\nThe fair value is primarily determined using a Monte-Carlo simulation model. Refer to Note 35g 'Amounts Recognised in the Financial Statements' for further detail. Management considers the fair value assigned to be an area of estimation uncertainty as it requires judgements on Lendlease's security price and whether vesting conditions will be satis/fied.\n\nAt each balance sheet date, the Group revises its estimates of the entitlement due. It recognises the impact of revision of original estimates on non market conditions, if any, in the Income Statement, and a corresponding adjustment to equity over the remaining vesting period. Changes in entitlement for equity settled share based compensation plans are not recognised if they fail to vest due to market conditions not being met.\n\n## Superannuation Accumulation Plan Expense\n\nAll employees in the Australia region are entitled to bene/fits on retirement, disability or death from the Group's superannuation accumulation plan. The majority of these employees are party to a de/fined contribution plan and receive /fixed contributions from the Group. The Group has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid. The contributions are recognised as an employee bene/fit expense when they are due. The Group also operates a de/fined bene/fit superannuation plan, membership of which is now closed. Refer to Note 34 'De/fined Bene/fit Plan' for further detail.\n\n## Impairment\n\nThe carrying amounts of the Group's assets, subject to impairment tests, are reviewed at each balance sheet date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, the asset's recoverable amount is estimated. The calculation of this recoverable amount is dependent on the type of asset. The material assets' accounting policies will contain further information on these calculations.\n\nAn impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognised in the Income Statement.\n\n## Reversals of Impairment\n\nImpairment losses on assets can be reversed (other than goodwill) when there is a subsequent increase in the recoverable amount. The increase could be due to a speci/fic event, the indication that impairment may no longer exist or there is a change in estimates used to determine the recoverable amount.\n\nAn impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset's carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.\n\n## Lease Expense\n\nShort term lease and low value lease payments, including outgoings, are recognised in the Income Statement on a straight line basis over the term of the lease.\n\n## Depreciation and Amortisation\n\nDepreciation on owned assets is charged to the Income Statement on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of items of property, plant and equipment. Amortisation is provided on leasehold improvements over the remaining term of the lease. Most plant is depreciated over a period not exceeding 20 years, furniture and /fittings over three to 15 years, motor vehicles over four to eight years and computer equipment over three years.\n\nRight-of-use assets are depreciated using the straight line method from the commencement date to the earlier of the end of the useful life of the right-of-use asset or the end of the lease term.",

Non audit services include amounts charged for work relating to /financial, regulatory and asset due diligence of the Group and its consolidated entities.\n\n## 8. Finance Revenue and Finance Costs\n\n## Accounting Policies\n\nFinance revenue is recognised as it is earned using the e/ffective interest method, which applies the interest rate that discounts estimated future cash receipts over the expected life of the /financial instrument. The discount is then recognised as /finance revenue over the remaining life of the /financial instrument.\n\nFinance costs include interest, amortisation of discounts or premiums relating to borrowings and amortisation of costs incurred in connection with the arrangement of new borrowings facilities. Costs incurred in connection with the arrangement of borrowings are capitalised and amortised over the life of the borrowings. Finance costs are expensed immediately as incurred unless they relate to acquisition and development of qualifying assets. Qualifying assets are assets that take more than six months to prepare for their intended use or sale. Finance costs related to qualifying assets are capitalised.\n\n|                                                    | June 2024 $m   | June 2023 $m   |\n|----------------------------------------------------|----------------|----------------|\n| Finance Revenue                                    |                |                |\n| Other corporations                                 | 17             | 13             |\n| Other /finance revenue                             | 9              | 8              |\n| Total interest /finance revenue                    | 26             | 21             |\n| Interest discounting                               | 3              | 1              |\n| Gain on repurchase of commercial notes 1           | 39             | 63             |\n| Total /finance revenue                             | 68             | 85             |\n| Finance Costs                                      |                |                |\n| Interest expense in relation to other corporations | 265            | 174            |\n| Interest expense in relation to lease liabilities  | 13             | 15             |\n| Less:  Capitalised interest /finance costs 2       | (29)           | (30)           |\n| Total interest /finance costs                      | 249            | 159            |\n| Non interest /finance costs                        | 57             | 14             |\n| Total /finance costs                               | 306            | 173            |\n| Net /finance costs                                 | (238)          | (88)           |\n\n- 1.

Taxation\n\n## Accounting Policies\n\nIncome tax on the pro/fit or loss for the /financial year comprises current and deferred tax. Income tax is recognised in the Income Statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity. Under current Australian income tax law, LLT is not liable for income tax, including capital gains tax, to the extent that unitholders are attributed the taxable income of LLT.\n\nCurrent tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the /financial year, using applicable tax rates (and tax laws) at the balance sheet date in each jurisdiction, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous /financial years.\n\nDeferred tax is the expected tax payable in future periods as a result of past transactions or events and is calculated by comparing the accounting balance sheet to the tax balance sheet. Temporary di/fferences are provided for any di/fferences in the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities between the accounting and tax balance sheets. The following temporary di/fferences are not provided for:\n\n- \u00b7 The initial recognition of taxable goodwill\n- \u00b7 The initial recognition of assets or liabilities that a/ffect neither accounting nor taxable pro/fit\n- \u00b7 Di/fferences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they are not likely to reverse in the foreseeable future.\n\nMeasurement of deferred tax is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using applicable tax rates (and tax laws) at the balance sheet date.\n\n## Global minimum tax\n\nThe Company is monitoring the global progress toward the enactment and implementation of new Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development rules under Pillar Two. Under the Pillar Two rules, the Group would be liable to pay a top-up tax for jurisdictions where the e/ffective tax rate calculated in accordance with Pillar Two rules falls below the minimum tax rate of 15%.\n\nPillar Two legislation has been passed in certain jurisdictions in which the Group operates. The Group is in scope of the legislation that will be e/ffective in certain jurisdictions for the Group's /financial year beginning 1 July 2024.\n\nAn assessment of the Group's potential exposure to Pillar Two income taxes has been performed, based on historical data over several years for the impacted entities in the Group. Based on this assessment, it is not anticipated that there will be a material impact to tax expense for the Group on implementation of Pillar Two. The impact of implementing Pillar Two on future years will continue to be assessed.\n\nThe Group has applied the mandatory exception to recognising and disclosing information about deferred tax assets and liabilities related to Pillar Two income tax legislation, in accordance with AASB 112 Income Taxes .\n\nRecognition of deferred tax assets is only to the extent it is probable that future taxable pro/fits will be available so as the related tax asset will be realised. Deferred tax assets may include the following:\n\n- \u00b7 Deductible temporary di/fferences\n- \u00b7 Unused tax losses\n- \u00b7 Unused tax credits.\n\nManagement considers the estimation of future taxable pro/fits to be an area of estimation uncertainty as a change in any of the assumptions used in budgeting and forecasting would have an impact on the future pro/fitability of the Group. The Group prepares /financial budgets and forecasts, covering a /five year period, which are reviewed on a regular basis. These forecasts and budgets form the basis of future pro/fitability to support the carrying value of the deferred tax assets. The performance of the Group is in/fluenced by a variety of general economic and business conditions, which are outside the control of the Group, including the level of in/flation, interest rates, exchange rates, commodity prices, ability to access funding, oversupply and demand conditions and government /fiscal, monetary and regulatory policies.\n\nPresentation of deferred tax assets and liabilities can be o/ffset if there is a legally enforceable right to o/ffset current tax liabilities and assets, and they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority on the same taxable entity or on di/fferent tax entities, but are intended to be settled on a net basis or to be realised simultaneously.\n\n## Tax Consolidation\n\nThe Company is the head entity of the Australian Tax Consolidated Group comprising all the Australian wholly owned subsidiaries, excluding LLT. As a consequence, all members of the Australian Tax Consolidation Group are taxed as a single entity.",

Investment\n\nInvestment in the Development pipeline, joint ventures in property projects, the retirement sector, and more passive assets, such as property funds, drive the current and future performance of the Group. This section includes disclosures for property such as Inventories and indirect property assets such as Equity Accounted Investments and Other Financial Assets contained within the Statement of Financial Position.\n\n## 11. Inventories\n\n## Accounting Policies\n\n## Development Properties\n\nProperty acquired for development and sale in the ordinary course of business is carried at the lower of cost and Net Realisable Value (NRV).\n\nThe cost of development properties includes expenditure incurred in acquiring the property, preparing it for sale and borrowing costs incurred.\n\nThe NRV is the estimated selling price, less the estimated costs of completion and selling expenses. Management considers the estimation of both selling prices and costs of completion to be an area of estimation uncertainty, as these estimations take into consideration market conditions a/ffecting each property and the underlying strategy for selling the property.\n\nThe recoverable amount of each property is assessed at each balance date and accounting judgement is required to assess whether a provision is raised where cost (including costs to complete) exceeds NRV.\n\nInventories are expensed as cost of sales in the Income Statement. Management uses accounting judgement in determining the following:\n\n- \u00b7 The apportionment of cost of sales through sales revenue\n- \u00b7 The amount of cost of sales, which includes costs incurred to date and /final forecast costs\n- \u00b7 The nature of the expenditure, which may include acquisition costs, development costs, borrowing costs and those costs incurred in preparing the property for sale.\n\n## Construction Contract Assets\n\nThe gross amount of Construction and Development Work in Progress consists of costs attributable to work performed, including recoverable pre contract and project bidding costs and emerging pro/fit after providing for any foreseeable losses. In applying the accounting policies on providing for these losses, accounting judgement is required.\n\nConstruction contract assets are presented as part of inventories for all contracts in which revenue recognised (costs incurred plus recognised pro/fits) exceed progress billings. If progress billings and/or recognised contract losses exceed revenue recognised, then the di/fference is presented in Trade and other payables as a Construction contract liability.\n\n|                              | Note   | June 2024 $m   | June 2023 $m   |\n|------------------------------|--------|----------------|----------------|\n| Current                      |        |                |                |\n| Development properties 1     |        | 1,016          | 968            |\n| Construction contract assets | 21.a   | 660            | 594            |\n| Total current                |        | 1,676          | 1,562          |\n| Non Current                  |        |                |                |\n| Development properties 1     |        | 1,342          | 2,681          |\n| Total non current            |        | 1,342          | 2,681          |\n| Total inventories            |        | 3,018          | 4,243          |",

        "page_content": "## 12. Equity Accounted Investments\n\n## Accounting Policies\n\n## Equity Accounted Investments (Associates and Joint Ventures)\n\nAs outlined in Note 5 'Share of Pro/fit of Equity Accounted Investments', investments in Associates and Joint Ventures are equity accounted. The share of investment recognised under the equity method is the Group's share of the investment's net assets based on ownership interest held.\n\nInvestments in associates and joint ventures are carried at the lower of the equity accounted carrying amount and the recoverable amount. When the Group's share of losses exceeds the carrying amount of the equity accounted investment (including assets that form part of the net investment in the associate or joint venture entity), the carrying amount is reduced to nil and recognition of further losses is discontinued except to the extent that the Group has obligations in respect of the associate or joint venture.\n\nDividends from associates and joint ventures represent a return on the Group's investment and, as such, are applied as a reduction to the carrying value of the investment. Unrealised gains arising from transactions with equity accounted investments are eliminated against the investment in the associate or joint venture to the extent of the Group's interest in the associate or joint venture. Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealised gains, but only to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment. Other movements in associates' and joint ventures' reserves are recognised directly in the Group's consolidated reserves.\n\n## Development - Investment Property\n\nInvestments in this category hold investment property that is under construction and is subject to periodic revaluations. These revaluations represent development pro/fit earned and are recognised in the Development segment.\n\n## Development - Inventory\n\nInvestments in this category contain inventory under development and are held at cost. Revenue is recognised once the inventory settles with the customer and is recognised in the Development segment.\n\n## Service Concession Arrangements (SCAs)\n\nThe Group equity accounts its investment in project companies with SCAs through Public Private Partnerships (PPPs). These arrangements provide facilities management and maintenance services with terms generally of 25 to 30 years. They also incorporate contractual obligations to make available the individual assets for their prescribed use and, where necessary, overhaul or replace major items of plant and equipment related to the assets with payment obtained through periodic draw downs from the relevant government authorities.\n\n## Joint Operations\n\nA joint operation is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to the assets and obligations for the liabilities relating to the arrangement.\n\nInvestments in joint operations are accounted for by recognising amounts on a line by line basis in accordance with the accounting standards applicable to the particular assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses in relation to the Group's interest in the joint operation.\n\n|                                    | Note   | June 2024 $m   | June 2023 $m   |\n|------------------------------------|--------|----------------|----------------|\n| Associates                         |        |                |                |\n| Investment in associates           | 12.a   | 740            | 713            |\n| Less:  Impairment                  | 12.a   | -              | -              |\n| Total associates                   |        | 740            | 713            |\n| Joint Ventures                     |        |                |                |\n| Investment in joint ventures       | 12.b   | 5,146          | 4,961          |\n| Less:  Impairment                  | 12.b   | (27)           | (27)           |\n| Total joint ventures               |        | 5,119          | 4,934          |\n| Total equity accounted investments |        | 5,859          | 5,647          |",

Borrowings and Financing Arrangements\n\n## Accounting Policies\n\nBorrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the e/ffective interest rate method. Under the amortised cost method the di/fference between the amount initially recognised and the redemption value is recorded in the Income Statement over the period of the borrowing on an e/ffective interest basis. Borrowings are referred to in this section using their redemption value when describing the terms and conditions.",

Issued Capital\n\n## Accounting Policies\n\n## Issued Capital\n\nOrdinary shares are classi/fied as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of ordinary shares are recognised as a deduction from equity.\n\nWhen share capital recognised as equity is repurchased, the amount of the consideration paid, including directly attributable costs, is recognised as a change in equity. Repurchased shares are typically classi/fied as treasury shares and are recognised as a deduction from equity.\n\n|                                                                                     | LENDLEASE CORPORATION LIMITED   | LENDLEASE CORPORATION LIMITED   | LENDLEASE CORPORATION LIMITED   | LENDLEASE CORPORATION LIMITED   | LENDLEASE TRUST   | LENDLEASE TRUST   | LENDLEASE TRUST   | LENDLEASE TRUST   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|\n|                                                                                     | June 2024                       | June 2024                       | June 2023                       | June 2023                       | June 2024         | June 2024         | June 2023         | June 2023         |\n|                                                                                     | No. of  Shares                  |                                 | No. of  Shares                  |                                 | No. of Units      |                   | No. of Units      |                   |\n|                                                                                     | (m)                             | $m                              | (m)                             | $m                              | (m)               | $m                | (m)               | $m                |\n| Issued capital at beginning  of /financial year, net of  prior period share buyback | 689                             | 1,894                           | 689                             | 1,891                           | 689               | 1,539             | 689               | 1,538             |\n| Distribution Reinvestment  Plan (DRP)                                               | 1                               | 2                               | -                               | 3                               | 1                 | 1                 | -                 | 1                 |\n| Issued capital at end of  /financial period                                         | 690                             | 1,896                           | 689                             | 1,894                           | 690               | 1,540             | 689               | 1,539             |\n\n## 17.a. Issuance of Securities\n\nAs at 30 June 2024, the Group had 690 million stapled securities on issue, equivalent to the number of Lendlease Corporation shares and Lendlease Trust (LLT) units on issue as at that date. The issued units of LLT are not owned by the Company and are therefore presented separately in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position within equity.",

        "page_content": "## 17.b. Security Accumulation Plans\n\nThe Group's Distribution Reinvestment Plan (DRP) was reactivated in February 2011. The last date for receipt of an election notice for participation in the DRP is 27 August 2024. The issue price is the arithmetic average of the daily volume weighted average price of Lendlease Group stapled securities traded (on the Australian Securities Exchange) for the period of /five consecutive business days immediately following the record date, commencing on 27 August 2024, for determining entitlements to distribution. If that price is less than 50 cents, the issue price will be 50 cents. Stapled securities issued under the DRP rank equally with all other stapled securities on issue.\n\n## 17.c. Terms and Conditions\n\nIssued capital for Lendlease Corporation Limited comprises ordinary shares fully paid. A stapled security represents one share in the Company stapled to one unit in LLT. Stapled securityholders have the right to receive declared dividends from the Company and distributions from LLT and are entitled to one vote per stapled security at securityholders' meetings. Ordinary stapled securityholders rank after all creditors in repayment of capital.\n\nThe Group does not have authorised capital or par value in respect of its issued stapled securities.\n\n## 18. Capital Management\n\nThe Group assesses capital management as part of its broader strategic plan. The Group focuses on interrelated /financial parameters, including Return on Equity, earnings growth and borrowing capacity. The Group also monitors its gearing ratio, leverage ratio, interest coverage ratio and weighted average cost of debt and maturity pro/file. These are all taken into account when the Group makes decisions on how to invest its capital and evaluate its existing investments.\n\nThe Group's capital includes total equity, borrowings and other interest bearing liabilities. When investing capital, the Group's objective is to deliver strong total securityholder returns and to maintain an investment grade credit rating by maintaining an appropriate /financial pro/file. The Moody's/Fitch long term credit ratings at 30 June 2024 are Baa3/BBB- respectively (June 2023: Baa3/BBB-).\n\nThe capital structure of the Group can be changed by equity issuance, paying distributions to securityholders, the Distribution Reinvestment Plan and changing the level of debt. For further information on how the Group allocates and manages capital, refer to details of the Portfolio Management Framework in the Managing and Measuring Value - Financial section and Performance and Outlook section of this Annual Report.\n\n## 19. Liquidity Risk Exposure\n\nFurther information on liquidity risk is disclosed in Note 24 'Financial Risk Management'. As disclosed in Note 27 'Contingent Liabilities', in certain circumstances, the Company guarantees the performance of particular Group entities in respect of their obligations including bonding and bank guarantees. Issued bank guarantees have cash collateralisation requirements if the bank guarantee facility is not renewed by the provider.\n\nAt 30 June 2024, the Group does not anticipate a signi/ficant liquidity risk in relation to the following /financial liabilities. This is due to the Group's strong /financial pro/file, as supported by the signi/ficant committed undrawn facilities and low gearing ratio. Refer to Note 14 'Cash and Cash Equivalents' and Note 16 'Borrowings and Financing Arrangements'.\n\nThe Group has provided collateral of $nil (June 2023: $nil) against letter of credit facilities.",

Loans and Receivables\n\n## Accounting Policies\n\nLoans and receivables, which include trade and other receivables, are non derivative /financial assets with /fixed or determinable payments that are not equity securities. They arise when the Group provides money, goods or services directly to a debtor with no intention of trading the receivable. Contract debtors represent receivables where the right to receive payment from customers remains conditional. Other receivables include receivables related to investment management, property development and miscellaneous items.\n\nLoans and receivables are carried at amortised cost using the e/ffective interest method, which applies the interest rate that discounts estimated future cash receipts over the term of the loans and receivables. Cash /flows relating to short term trade and other receivables are not discounted if the e/ffect of discounting is immaterial. The discount, if material, is then recognised as revenue over the remaining term.\n\nThe Group assesses provision for impairment of loans and receivables based on expected loss, and books a provision if material.

Trade and Other Payables\n\n## Accounting Policies\n\n## Trade Creditors\n\nLiabilities are recognised for amounts to be paid in the future for goods or services received, whether or not billed to the Group. Trade and other payables are settled in the normal course of business. Trade and other payables are carried at amortised cost using the e/ffective interest method, which applies the interest rate that discounts estimated future cash out/flows over the term of the trade and other payables. Cash /flows relating to short term trade and other payables are not discounted if the e/ffect of discounting is immaterial. The discount, if material, is then recognised as an expense over the remaining term.\n\n## Construction Contract Liabilities\n\nConstruction contracts where the total progress billings issued to clients (together with foreseeable losses, if applicable) on a project exceed the revenue recognised (costs incurred to date plus recognised pro/fit) on the contract are recognised as a liability.\n\n## Retentions\n\nRetentions are amounts payable for the purpose of security and for the provision of defects in accordance with contract terms. Release of retention amounts are in accordance with contractual terms.\n\n## Unearned Income\n\nPrimarily relates to unearned income and deposits received in advance on presold apartments. These amounts will be recognised as income in line with the 'Sale of development properties' accounting policy in Note 4 'Revenue from Contracts with Customers'.\n\n## Lease Liabilities\n\nLease liabilities are measured at the present value of the lease payments discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease. The Group uses its incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate.",

Provisions\n\n## Accounting Policies\n\n## Provisions\n\nProvisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that the Group will be required to settle that obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.\n\nThe amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present obligation at the reporting date, taking into account the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation.

As part of this action, the defect liabilities period has been extended from 6 to 30 years, and there have been updates to building safety regulations for completed residential buildings.\n\nSo as not to be subject to signi/ficant trade restrictions, consistent with other UK developers, Lendlease entered into a contract with the UK Government on 22 March 2023, committing to remediate building safety risks consistent with these legislative changes.\n\nLendlease has established a dedicated team undertaking the work to address the issues raised on various buildings. Lendlease believes that the liability currently relates to 60 buildings (June 2023: 59 buildings), most of which were developed by Crosby, a company that Lendlease acquired in 2005 to enter the residential development market in the UK. Notably, many of these buildings were completed or had commenced construction prior to Lendlease's acquisition. Lendlease no longer owns any of these buildings.\n\nIt is noted that each building completed by a Lendlease entity was certi/fied as complying with applicable building regulations at the time of its completion.\n\nAt 30 June 2024, Lendlease holds a provision of $365 million (June 2023: $319 million) in respect of this matter. Movements in the provision during the year relate to changes in cost estimates, changes in discount rate, the unwinding of discount due to the passage of",

During the year a settlement was reached with a third-party contractor for the recovery of costs in relation to a number of buildings included in the provision. The settlement payment in relation to these buildings was received in June 2024. The income statement presents the settlement net against the increase in the provision estimate during the year, discounting unwind and the administrative costs of managing the remediation program.\n\nThe cash expenditure by Lendlease is expected to be spread over a period of at least six and a half years from 30 June 2024. On-going expenses in relation to this matter have been excluded from Core Operating Pro/fit given it is a consequence of retrospective government action, which could not reasonably have been expected from normal operations.\n\nWe have included in the provision amounts for buildings where we have cost estimates provided by third parties or building owners. There are a number of other buildings for which we do not have documentation and are not able to establish whether remediation work is required. There continue to be both risks and opportunities to the provision that has been estimated. Key risks include the addition of new buildings or new information in relation to already identi/fied buildings, as well as the rising costs in the local market. Key opportunities include the potential for bulk procurement, re-interrogating scope on tender pricing, and assessing various options in the delivery model.\n\nThe provision does not include any further recoveries anticipated from third parties, including insurances and supply chain. Lendlease is actively working to maximise third party recoveries however expects this process will be over an extended period of time.\n\nDetermining the liability position for this matter and any estimate is a complex process requiring signi/ficant judgement with respect to whether there is an obligating event and the quantum of any liability. The estimate of any potential liability is based on incomplete information and will be updated as work and time progresses. Lendlease will continue to engage with building owners and the UK Government on these industry wide actions and assess additional relevant information on an ongoing basis.",

Derivative counterparties and cash deposits are limited to recognised /financial intermediaries with a minimum investment grade credit rating as determined by a recognised rating agency\n- \u00b7 Refer to Note 21 'Loans and Receivables' for information relating to impairment on loans and receivables\n- \u00b7 In certain circumstances, the Group will hold either /financial or non /financial assets as collateral to further mitigate the potential credit risk on selected transactions. During the current and prior year, the Group did not hold /financial or non /financial assets as collateral.

Interest Rate Risk Exposure\n\nThe Group's exposure to interest rate risk on its /financial assets and liabilities is set out as follows:\n\n|                       | CARRYING AMOUNT   | CARRYING AMOUNT   |\n|-----------------------|-------------------|-------------------|\n|                       | June 2024 $m      | June 2023 $m      |\n| Fixed Rate            |                   |                   |\n| Financial assets      | 200               | 201               |\n| Financial liabilities | (2,129)           | (2,375)           |\n|                       | (1,929)           | (2,174)           |\n| Variable Rate         |                   |                   |\n| Financial assets      | 361               | 783               |\n| Financial liabilities | (2,551)           | (2,544)           |\n|                       | (2,190)           | (1,761)           |\n\n## Sensitivity Analysis\n\nAt 30 June 2024, it is estimated that an increase of one percentage point in interest rates would have decreased the Group's Pro/fit after tax by $15 million (June 2023: $2 million decrease in the Group's Pro/fit after tax). A one percentage point decrease in interest rates would have increased the Group's Pro/fit after tax by $15 million (June 2023: $2 million increase in the Group's Pro/fit after tax). The increase or decrease in interest income/(expense) is proportional to the increase or decrease in interest rates. Interest rate derivatives have been included in this calculation.\n\n## 25. Hedging\n\n## Accounting Policies\n\nThe Group uses derivative /financial instruments to hedge its exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risks arising from operating, /financing and investing activities. Derivative /financial instruments are recognised initially at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and subsequently remeasured at fair value. Hedge accounting recognises the o/ffsetting e/ffects on pro/fit or loss of changes in the fair value of the derivative /financial instruments and the hedged item. The accounting for hedges that meet the criteria for hedge accounting are classi/fied as either fair value hedges, cash /flow hedges or investment hedges.\n\nThe Group has minimal hedges designated at fair value. The Group primarily uses forward foreign exchange contracts as cash /flow hedges for highly probable sale, purchase and dividend transactions. The Group also uses forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge cross border intercompany loans and transactions which mainly net o/ff in the Income Statement. Interest rate swaps and interest rate options are used to manage the Group's exposure to interest rates arising from borrowings. These are primarily treated as cash /flow hedges and are mainly on borrowings within equity accounted investments.\n\nThe Group has foreign exchange derivative contracts primarily held in GBP, USD, EUR and SGD at reporting date to hedge speci/fic foreign currency exposures. The total gross payable exposure is $438 million (June 2023: payable $1,595 million).\n\nThere are 4 foreign currency contracts that will mature in more than one year (June 2023: 12 foreign currency contracts).",

While this represents the best estimation of fair value at the reporting date, the fair values may di/ffer if there is volatility in market prices or foreign exchange rates in future periods.\n\nAll /financial instruments recognised in the Statement of Financial Position, including those instruments carried at amortised cost, are recognised at amounts that represent a reasonable approximation of fair value, with the exception of the following borrowings:\n\n|                  |      | June 2024          | June 2024     | June 2023          | June 2023     |\n|------------------|------|--------------------|---------------|--------------------|---------------|\n|                  | Note | Carrying Amount $m | Fair Value $m | Carrying Amount $m | Fair Value $m |\n| Liabilities      |      |                    |               |                    |               |\n| Current          |      |                    |               |                    |               |\n| Commercial notes | 16.a | -                  | -             | -                  | -             |\n| Non Current      |      |                    |               |                    |               |\n| Commercial notes | 16.a | 1,789              | 1,737         | 1,928              | 1,780         |\n\nThe fair value of commercial notes has been calculated by discounting the expected future cash /flows by the appropriate government bond rates and credit margin applicable to the relevant term of the commercial note.\n\n## 26.a. Basis of Determining Fair Value\n\nThe determination of fair values of /financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value are summarised as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 The fair value of unlisted equity investments, including investments in property funds, is determined based on an assessment of the underlying unadjusted net assets values, which may include periodic independent and Directors' valuations, future maintainable earnings and any special circumstances pertaining to the particular investment. Fair value of unlisted equity investments has also taken the economic conditions into consideration to determine fair value at 30 June 2024. This included valuations of underlying investment properties at balance date\n- \u00b7 The fair values of other /financial assets and /financial liabilities (excluding derivative instruments) are determined in accordance with generally accepted valuation techniques; these include the use of recent arm's length transactions, reference to other assets that are substantially the same, and discounted cash /flow analysis\n- \u00b7 The fair value of derivative instruments comprises forward foreign exchange contracts, which are valued using forward rates at balance date, and interest rate swap contracts, which are measured at the present value of future cash /flows estimated and discounted based on applicable yield curves derived from quoted interest rates and include consideration of counterparty risk adjustments.\n\n## 26.b. Fair Value Measurements\n\nThe di/fferent levels for valuation method have been de/fined as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Level 1: The fair value is determined using the unadjusted quoted price for an identical asset or liability in an active market for identical assets or liabilities\n- \u00b7 Level 2: The fair value is calculated using predominantly observable market data other than unadjusted quoted prices for an identical asset or liability\n- \u00b7 Level 3: The fair value is calculated using inputs that are not based on observable market data.\n\nAll commercial notes were measured at Level 3 for the periods presented in this Consolidated Financial Statements. During the /financial year, there were no material transfers between Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3 fair value hierarchies.",

Contingent Liabilities\n\nThe Group has the following contingent liabilities, being liabilities in respect of which there is the potential for a cash out/flow in excess of any provision where the likelihood of payment is not considered probable or cannot be measured reliably at this time:\n\n- \u00b7 There are a number of legal claims and exposures that arise from the normal course of the Group's business. Such claims and exposures largely arise in respect of claims for defects (including under both contract and legislation), claims for breach of performance obligations or breach of warranty or claims under indemnities. In some claims:\n- - There is uncertainty as to whether a legal obligation exists;\n- - There is uncertainty as to whether a future cash out/flow will arise in respect to these items; and/or\n- - It is not possible to quantify the potential exposure with su/fficient reliability.\n\nThis particularly applies in larger more complex projects, in claims involving a number of parties or in claims made a number of years after completion of a project or the occurrence of the relevant event.\n\nWhere it is probable there will be liabilities from such claims and the potential exposure can be quanti/fied with su/fficient reliability, a provision has been made for anticipated losses arising from such claims.\n\n- \u00b7 In certain circumstances, the Company guarantees the performance of particular Group entities in respect of their obligations. This includes bonding and bank guarantee facilities used primarily by the Construction business as well as performance guarantees for certain of the Company's subsidiaries.\n\n## Securities Class Action\n\nLendlease Corporation Limited and Lendlease Responsible Entity Limited (together the Lendlease Group) were served with a shareholder class action proceeding /filed in the Supreme Court of New South Wales on 18 April 2019 by David William Pallas and Julie Ann Pallas as trustees for the Pallas Family Superannuation Fund, represented by Maurice Blackburn. On 7 August 2019, Lendlease Group was served with a shareholder class action proceeding /filed in the Supreme Court of New South Wales on 6 August 2019 by Martin John Fletcher, represented by Phi Finney McDonald. On 21 November 2019 the Supreme Court ordered consolidation of the two class actions into a single proceeding. The consolidated proceeding alleges that Lendlease was in breach of its continuous disclosure obligations under the Corporations Act 2001 and made representations about its Engineering and Services business that were misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive. It is currently not possible to determine the ultimate impact of these claims, if any, on Lendlease Group. Lendlease Group denies the allegations and intends to vigorously defend this proceeding.\n\n## Retirement Living Tax Matter\n\nThe Group was subject to an Australian Tax O/ffice (ATO) audit of the partial sale of its Retirement Living business in the 2018 year. Prior to the commencement of the audit and submitting its 2018 tax return the Group proactively contacted the ATO to review the tax treatment applied to the partial sale and also obtained independent advice. The ATO previously provided written undertakings that no interest or penalties would be applied to the 2018 /financial year tax return.\n\nDuring the current reporting period the ATO issued the Group with a statement of audit position and an amended income tax assessment relating to the audit of the 2018 return. The amended assessment for 2018 is for $112.1 million comprising:\n\n- \u00b7 $62.4 million capital gains tax arising from the exit of the Retirement Living trust from the Lendlease tax consolidated group which was a one-o/ff event that only applies to the 2018 transaction;\n- \u00b7 $25.2 million additional tax from the sale of 25% of the units in the joint venture trust; and\n- \u00b7 $24.5 million of interest.\n\nThe ATO has the ability to levy penalties and interest where tax that should be paid has not been paid. The amended assessment did not include any penalties, however the ATO invited Lendlease to make a submission on penalties and interest. The Group has formally objected to the amended assessment and lodged a submission on penalties and interest based on the ATO's previous written undertakings. The ATO has yet to advise its decision on the objection to the amended assessment and the remission of interest and imposition of penalties. On 9 August 2024, the Group made a payment of $44 million to the ATO, representing 50% of the shortfall tax currently under dispute to reduce further interest accruing. This amount will be refundable if the Group is ultimately successful with the dispute.\n\nSince the partial sale of the Retirement Living business in 2018, Lendlease has sold down two further tranches of the units in the joint venture trust in the 2021 and 2022 /financial years, totalling 50%. Based on the ATO's position for the 2018 income year, additional tax of approximately $50 million could arise in relation to these subsequent sales. The Group has voluntarily disclosed this to the ATO, however the ATO are yet to issue amended assessments. It is estimated there could be an additional /financial impact of up to $8 million in relation to interest, absent any remission of that interest by the ATO. The Group will dispute any amended assessments issued in respect of the subsequent sales.\n\nThe Group also retains a 25% interest in the Retirement Living joint venture trust. Should the ATO apply the same treatment to any future gain on sale of this investment, we estimate this may give rise to additional tax of approximately $25 million.\n\nIf the objection is not accepted by the ATO, the timing of resolution of any subsequent dispute cannot be determined.\n\nThe Group has received independent legal advice in respect of its position. The Group believes its tax treatment of the partial sale of the Retirement Living business is in accordance with the law and consistent with the ATO's 2002 tax ruling on the taxation of the retirement living industry. The Group lodged its 2018 tax return on that basis and believe that it will be successful in its position. On that basis it is probable that no additional taxes, interest or penalties in respect of these matters will be paid to the ATO. The Group intends to vigorously defend its position in relation to that return and subsequent returns which are impacted by the issue and to contest the matter through litigation, should its objection to the ATO be unsuccessful.",

Consolidated Entities\n\n## Accounting Policies\n\nThe Group consolidation comprises all subsidiaries controlled by the Company. Control exists when the Company:\n\n- \u00b7 Has the power to direct the relevant activities such as key operating, /financial and investing decisions\n- \u00b7 Has exposure or rights to variable returns from its involvement with the investee such as dividends, loans and fees\n- \u00b7 Has the ability to use its power over the investee to a/ffect the amount of returns.\n\nIn assessing control, potential voting rights that are presently exercisable or convertible are taken into account. Management uses accounting judgement in determining whether the Group controls an entity by applying the above control criteria and reviewing the substance of its relationship with the entity.\n\nThe /financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated /financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases. The /financial statements of subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting period as the parent company, using consistent accounting policies with adjustments made to bring into line any dissimilar accounting policies that may exist.\n\nExternal non controlling interests are allocated their share of total comprehensive income and are presented within equity in the consolidated Statement of Financial Position, separately from the equity of securityholders.\n\nThe material consolidated entities of the Group listed below were wholly owned during the current and prior year.

Employee Bene/fit Vehicles\n\nThe Company sponsors a number of employee bene/fit vehicles, including employee security plans and employee security ownership vehicles. These vehicles, while not legally controlled, are currently required to be consolidated for accounting purposes.\n\n## 29.a. Employee Security Plans\n\nAs at 30 June 2024, employees own approximately 0.9 per cent (June 2023: 0.9 per cent) of the issued capital of the Group through various active Lendlease employee security plans and ownership vehicles, details of which are outlined below:\n\n- \u00b7 Australia: Employee Share Acquisition Plan (ESAP): ESAP was established in December 1988 for the purpose of employees acquiring securities in the Group and is funded by Lendlease subscriptions, and employee salary sacri/fice contributions\n- \u00b7 Americas: US Rabbi Trust (Rabbi Trust) was established in 2004 and updated in 2005 for the acceptance of employee pro/fit share contributions used to acquire Group securities for US based employees. This part of the plan is not currently accepting new contributions\n- \u00b7 Employee Share Acquisition Plan (STI) (ESAP STI): ESAP STI was established in July 2014 for the purpose of acquiring and allocating securities granted as the deferred component of Short Term Incentive (STI) awards, which are funded by Lendlease subscriptions. Securities are currently allocated to employees across Australia, Singapore, Malaysia, the United Kingdom and the United States.\n\n## Eligibility\n\nThe eligibility rules for each plan are determined by reference to the regulatory, legal and tax rules of each country in which the Group operates.\n\n## Distributions and/or Voting Rights\n\nGenerally, employees in the various operating security plans are entitled to distributions and voting rights for allocated securities. The plans re/flect this intention subject to regulatory, legal and tax constraints. The trustee may exercise these rights in accordance with any /fiduciary or governance rules pertaining to the deed or trust laws in the legal and tax jurisdiction within which the trust operates.\n\n## 29.b. Employee Security Ownership Vehicles\n\nIn addition to the plans discussed above, Lendlease has an employee security ownership vehicle, Lendlease Retirement Bene/fit Fund (RBF):\n\n- \u00b7 RBF was established in 1984 with shareholder approval for the bene/fit of employees. RBF holds Lendlease securities. The Lendlease securities in RBF are not available for allocation to employees other than in the event of a change of control of the Group and, in accordance with RBF's trust deed, the capital of the trust is not available to the Group. The RBF trustee has discretion as to the distribution of the RBF funds. In 1992, a deed poll was executed which allows for the distribution of the income of RBF to the Company to fund employee bene/fit activities through the Lendlease Foundation. As a result of changes to the constitution and governance structure of the RBF trustee on 22 June 2017, Lendlease currently does not have control of RBF and therefore RBF is currently not required to be consolidated for accounting purposes\n- \u00b7 The income distributed by RBF to the Company is used to provide non /financial services to employees and the community.\n- \u00b7 The RBF arrangement is subject to periodic review to assess its ongoing role and operation.",

Intangible Assets\n\n## Accounting Policies\n\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the Group's share of the net identi/fiable assets and contingent liabilities of the acquired business at the date of acquisition. Goodwill on acquisition of subsidiaries is included in intangible assets as goodwill. Goodwill on acquisition of associates is included in the carrying value of investments in associates.\n\nGoodwill is tested annually for impairment and carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is not amortised. Gains and losses on the disposal of an entity include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the entity sold.\n\nFor the purposes of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to cash generating units (CGUs) (or groups of CGUs) that are expected to bene/fit from the business combination in which the goodwill arose. CGUs are an identi/fiable group of assets that generate cash associated with the goodwill. Management considers this is an area of estimation uncertainty as these calculations involve an estimation of the recoverable amount of the CGU to which the goodwill is allocated. The Australian Construction CGU applies the value in use basis, and the Europe, Americas and Asia Construction CGUs use the fair value less costs of disposal basis. Both approaches require the Group to estimate the future cash /flows expected to arise from the CGUs and a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the recoverable amounts.\n\nManagement agreements and other intangible assets acquired by the Group are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses (see Note 7 'Other Expenses'). Amortisation is charged to the Income Statement on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the intangible assets, ranging from three to 20 years.\n\n|                         | Note   |   June 2024 $m | June 2023 $m   |\n|-------------------------|--------|----------------|----------------|\n| Goodwill                | 32.a   |            573 | 1,085          |\n| Management agreements   |        |             15 | 16             |\n| Other intangibles 1     |        |            104 | 135            |\n| Total intangible assets |        |            692 | 1,236          |\n\n## 32.a.

Impairment Tests and Key Assumptions Used - Construction\n\nThe recoverable amount of the Construction CGUs is determined based on value in use (VIU) calculations for Australia CGU, and fair value less costs of disposal (FVLCD) for the Americas, Asia and Europe CGUs. For all the Construction CGUs, the assumptions used for determining the recoverable amount of each CGU are based on past experience and expectations for the future, utilising both internal and external sources of data and relevant industry trends.\n\n## Australia Construction - VIU\n\nNo impairment arose as a result of the review of goodwill for the Australia Construction CGU for the /financial year ended 30 June 2024. Based on information available and market conditions at 30 June 2024, a reasonably foreseeable change in the assumptions made in this assessment would not result in impairment of the Australia Construction goodwill. The foreseeable change in the assumptions took the economic conditions into consideration.\n\nThe following describes the key assumptions on which management has based its cash /flow projections when determining VIU relating to the Australia Construction CGU:\n\n## \u00b7 Cash Flows\n\nThe VIU calculations use pre tax cash /flow projections based on actual operating results, and /financial forecasts covering a /five year period which have been approved by management. These forecasts are based on management estimates to determine income, expenses, capital expenditure and cash /flows for the CGU.\n\n## \u00b7 Growth Rate\n\nThe terminal value growth rate used in the VIU calculations to extrapolate the cash /flows beyond the /five year period is 3.0 per cent (June 2023: 3.0 per cent). The growth rate re/flects the forecast long term average growth rate for the Australia Construction CGU.\n\n## \u00b7 Discount Rate\n\nThe discount rate applied to the cash /flow projections was 13.8 per cent (June 2023: 11.8 per cent). The Group's weighted average cost of capital is used as a starting point for determining the discount rate, with appropriate adjustments for the risk pro/file relating to Australia Construction CGU. The discount rates used are pre tax.\n\n## Americas, Asia and Europe Construction - FVLCD\n\nOn 27 May 2024 the Group announced a strategy update with key actions to simplify the organisational structure, exit international construction and accelerate the release of capital from its o/ffshore development project and assets. As a result of this strategy update, the recoverable amount of the Americas, Asia and Europe Construction CGUs was reassessed to their FVLCD and an impairment charge was recognised against the goodwill balances attributable to those regions, writing the balances o/ff in full for the /financial year ended 30 June 2024. No other assets within these CGUs were impaired as part of this assessment given the nature of the underlying operations.\n\nThe following describes the key assumptions on which management has based its cash /flow projections when determining FVLCD relating to the Americas, Asia and Europe Construction CGUs:\n\n## \u00b7 Cash Flows\n\nThe FVLCD calculations use pre tax cash /flow projections based on estimated actual operating results, and /financial forecasts covering the period up to expected business divestments, which have been approved by management. The cash/flow projections also include estimated selling price of each business based on current negotiated transactions or appropriate EBITDA multiples, and expected working capital adjustments on sale. Cash/flow projections included expected transaction costs.\n\n## \u00b7 Discount Rate\n\nThe discount rates applied to the cash /flow projections vary between 10.8 per cent and 14.1 per cent (June 2023 VIU model discount rates: between 10.3 per cent and 12.0 per cent). The Group's weighted average cost of capital is used as a starting point for determining the discount rate, with appropriate adjustments for the risk pro/file relating to the relevant CGUs and the countries in which they operate. The discount rates used are pre tax.\n\nIn May 2024 the Group announced it had agreed non-binding heads of terms with leading US construction /firm, Consigli Construction Co, for the sale of the Group's US East Coast construction operations. The transaction is currently progressing through due diligence and negotiations to /finalise detailed terms and conditions. The Group is progressing with the planned divestment of UK construction operations, targeting completion within 18 months.",

Disposal Group Assets and Liabilities Held for Sale\n\n## Accounting Policies\n\nThe group of assets and their corresponding liabilities (together referred to as a Disposal Group), may only be classi/fied as held for sale once the following criteria are met:\n\n- \u00b7 The carrying amount will be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use; and\n- \u00b7 The sale must be highly probable.\n\nA disposal group is measured at the lower of its carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. Where fair value is lower than the carrying amount, the di/fference is recognised as an impairment loss within the Income Statement.\n\n## Australia Communities projects\n\nOn 18 December 2023, the Group announced that it had entered into an agreement for the sale of 12 Australian master-planned Communities projects to Stockland Corporation Limited and its capital partner, Supalai Australia Holdings, for $1.3 billion, including the assumed exercise of a $239 million right to acquire certain land parcels. The transaction is subject to various conditions precedent, including Foreign Investment Review Board (FIRB), Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) and relevant landowner approvals. On 4 July 2024 the ACCC released a Statement of Issues in relation to the acquisition, which outlined the preliminary views of the ACCC and identi/fied areas of further enquiry. The ACCC advised a provisional date for announcement of its /final decision of 12 September 2024, however this date is subject to change.\n\nAs part of the transaction, the Group will retain four Communities projects, which will continue to be recognised as part of Core operations within the Development segment, with an Inventory balance of $243 million as at 30 June 2024.\n\n## Asia Paci/fic Life Science Platform\n\nOn 17 May 2024, the Group announced it had agreed to sell its Asia life sciences interests, which includes current life sciences construction and development capabilities together with the life sciences investments, to a newly established joint venture with Warburg Pincus, for $147 million. The transaction, which was completed after the year-end, realised approximately $60 million in net cash proceeds to Lendlease. The businesses and assets to be sold are currently recognised in the Construction and Investments segments.\n\n## US Military Housing\n\nOn 1 July 2024, the Group announced it had entered into an agreement with Omaha Beach Investment Holdings, LLC, an entity managed by Guggenheim Partners Investment Management, LLC, for the sale of the US Military Housing business for $480 million. The US Military Housing Business includes the operating platform of the business along with associated management rights for asset, property, development and construction management. Pro/fit after tax of $105 to 120 million is anticipated from this transaction, with /financial close and receipt of cash proceeds targeted by the end of 1H FY25. The transaction is subject to completion adjustments and conditions precedent including third-party consents from particular service branches of the U.S. Department of Defense. The business to be sold is currently recognised in the Construction and Investments segments.\n\nThe major classes of Disposal Group assets and liabilities held for sale in relation to these transactions are listed below. These balances are as at 30 June 2024 and do not represent the expected capital of the projects at completion, which will change based on the operations of the business up to that date.

De/fined Bene/fit Plan\n\n## Accounting Policies\n\nGroup companies operate pension plans. The plans are generally funded through payments to insurance companies or trustee administered funds as determined by periodic actuarial calculations.\n\nA de/fined bene/fit plan is a pension plan that de/fines the amount of pension bene/fit an employee will receive on retirement, usually dependent on one or more factors such as age, years of service and compensation.\n\nThe asset or liability recognised in the Statement of Financial Position in respect of de/fined bene/fit plan is the present value of the de/fined bene/fit obligation i.e. 'the pension liability' at the balance sheet date less the fair value of plan assets. The present value of the pension liability is determined by discounting the estimated future cash out/flows using interest rates of high quality corporate or government bonds, that:\n\n- \u00b7 Are denominated in the currency in which the bene/fits will be paid\n- \u00b7 Have terms to maturity approximating the terms of the related pension liability.\n\nThe de/fined bene/fit obligation is calculated at least annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method, which in simplistic terms proportions the bene/fit based on service. Management considers the valuation of de/fined bene/fit plan undertaken by the actuaries to be an area of estimation uncertainty as a number of key assumptions must be adopted to determine the valuation.\n\nActuarial losses/(gains) will arise where there is a di/fference between previous estimates and actual experience, or a change to assumptions in relation to demographic and /financial trends. These actuarial losses/(gains) are recognised in the period they occur, directly in other comprehensive income as remeasurements. They are included in retained earnings in the Statement of Changes in Equity and in the Statement of Financial Position.\n\nPast service costs are recognised immediately in the Income Statement.\n\n|                                        | Note   |   June 2024 $m |   June 2023 $m |\n|----------------------------------------|--------|----------------|----------------|\n| Lendlease UK Pension Scheme            | 34.a   |             82 |            171 |\n| Total net de/fined bene/fit plan asset |        |             82 |            171 |\n\n## 34.a. Lendlease UK Pension Scheme\n\nLendlease Construction Holdings (Europe) Limited (UK Construction) sponsors a funded de/fined bene/fit pension scheme (the Scheme) for qualifying UK employees. The Scheme is administered by a separate board of Trustees which is legally separate from UK Construction. The Scheme's Trustees are composed of representatives of both the employer and employees. The Trustees are required by law to act in the interest of all relevant bene/ficiaries and are responsible for the investment policy with regard to the assets plus the day to day administration of the bene/fits.\n\nThe Scheme is a funded de/fined bene/fit scheme, with the /final salary section providing retirement bene/fits based on /final salary and the index linked section providing retirement bene/fits based on career average salary. A separate section, the Personal Investment Section, provides retirement bene/fits on a de/fined contribution basis. The UK Construction's contributions to members' Personal Investment Fund accounts are not included in these disclosures.\n\nThe /final salary section closed to future accruals on 31 August 2008 and the index linked section closed to future accruals on 31 January 2012. During the year, the Trustees transacted a full scheme buy-in to insure the majority of the Scheme's bene/fits and materially reduce the Scheme's exposure to actuarial risk and market (investment) risk. The di/fference between the value of the liabilities insured and the cost of the insurance policy of $75 million (pre-tax) was recognised as a loss in other comprehensive income. This process identi/fied a number of adjustments required to be made to members' bene/fits, with the past service impact of $42 million being recognised as a gain in the Income Statement. UK Construction is no longer required to fund pension shortfalls, therefore previously held Scheme assets of $21 million have been removed from Plan Assets accordingly. There were no other Scheme amendments a/ffecting de/fined bene/fits payable, curtailments or settlements during the year. Until 31 March 2024, UK Construction paid 4.0 percent of members' basic salaries to cover the Scheme's expected administration costs and costs of bene/fits payable on death in service. From 1 April 2024, these costs are met from plan assets. The latest triennial valuation for 31 March 2023 showed the Scheme to have an actuarial surplus so de/ficit repair contributions are not required to be paid.",

However, this will be largely matched by an increase in the value of the Scheme's buy-in asset. Similarly, most of the Scheme's bene/fit obligations are linked to in/flation and higher in/flation will lead to higher liabilities, matched by an increase in the buy-in asset value. The majority of the Scheme's obligations are to provide bene/fits for the life of the member, so increases in life expectancy will result in an increase in the liabilities which would again be matched by an increase in the buy-in asset. The mortality assumptions are based on standard mortality tables which allow for expected future mortality improvements. The assumption is that a member aged 63 will live for a further 24.9 years (June 2023: 25.5 years) if they are male and 26.4 years if they are female (June 2023: 26.8 years).\n\nAt 30 June 2024, the weighted average duration of the de/fined bene/fit obligation was 13 years (June 2023: 14 years).\n\n## vii.

As noted above, there would be a corresponding change in value of the buy-in asset and therefore little change in the overall net de/fined bene/fit plan asset.\n\nNon pensioner bene/fits are linked to RPI in the period up to retirement. Once in payment, pension increases are linked to RPI but with a zero per cent /floor and di/fferent caps applying to di/fferent periods of pensionable service. The in/flation sensitivity re/flects a change in RPI in/flation and the associated increases in payment.\n\n## 35. Employee Bene/fits\n\nDetailed information regarding the Group's Executive Reward strategy is provided in the Remuneration Report within the Directors' Report. The key incentive plans are as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Short Term Incentive (STI)\n- \u00b7 Short Term Award (STA)\n- \u00b7 Long Term Incentive (LTI)\n- \u00b7 Long Term Award (LTA)\n- \u00b7 Restricted Securities Award (RSA)\n- \u00b7 Google Development Ventures (GDV) Incentive.",

        "page_content": "## 35.a. Short Term Incentive (STI)\n\nThe STI plan is an annual incentive plan whereby a number of employees receive bene/fits which are dependent upon the achievement of both Lendlease /financial and non /financial targets, and individual goals. The total value of the potential bene/fit varies by individual and is tested against relevant market levels for each role.\n\n- \u00b7 The STI plan typically comprises a cash component, which is paid in September following year end. For more senior employees, where the potential bene/fit is typically higher, the plan also includes a deferred component\n- \u00b7 Deferral periods are generally for one or two years. The deferred component is normally awarded as Lendlease securities and in some instances as cash. Securities are held in Lendlease employee security plan trusts on behalf of employees for the deferral period (refer to Note 29a 'Employee Security Plans'). For employees to receive the deferred component in full, they must generally be employed by the Group at the time of vesting.\n\n## 35.b. Short Term Award (STA)\n\nThe STA plan is an annual incentive plan which replaced the STI for a limited number of senior executives from 2019. It is designed to focus senior executives on priority areas for delivery in the current /financial year, including key Group and regional /financial targets, safety and other non /financial targets aligned to the Group's areas of focus.\n\nWhilst performance is assessed against a set of Group metrics when determining awards, the Board will assess the overall performance and contribution of individual senior executives, with a particular focus on safety.\n\nThe total value of the potential bene/fit varies by individual and is set with reference to both internal peers and external market levels. For FY20 and FY21, the STA plan has been awarded as cash in September following year end. From FY22 onwards, 50 per cent of awarded STA will be a deferred grant of Lendlease securities. The deferred portion will be released in two equal tranches after one and two years.\n\n## 35.c. Long Term Incentive (LTI)\n\nThe LTI plan is designed to:\n\n- \u00b7 Motivate executives to achieve the Group's long term strategic goals and provide reward where the Group delivers better value to securityholders than its peers\n- \u00b7 Align the interests of executives and securityholders, given that the reward received is linked to the Group's security price and average Return on Equity performance.\n\n## Arrangements for LTI Awards\n\n| LTI Design                   | How the LTI Works                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Performance  Rights          | \u00b7 An annual grant of 'performance rights' is made to a limited number of executives \u00b7 The Board intends that the awards be settled in Lendlease securities, although the award may be settled in cash or  other means at the Board's discretion \u00b7 On vesting, each performance right entitles executives to one Lendlease stapled security, or at the Board's discretion,                                                                                                                           |\n| FY22, FY23 and  FY24 Grants) | Performance  Period  (applicable to  \u00b7 100 per cent of the performance rights are assessed over a three year period.

Long Term Award (LTA)\n\nThe LTA plan replaced the LTI for a limited number of executives from 2019. It was designed to motivate and reward key executives to deliver on the Group's long term strategy and to allow them to share in the value created for securityholders. Speci/fically, the objectives are to:\n\n- \u00b7 Create rewards that are aligned to earnings\n- \u00b7 Align the interests of securityholders and our most senior executives\n- \u00b7 Promote team behaviours and an enterprise leadership mindset\n- \u00b7 Retain the senior executive team.\n\nThe intended outcome is that reward and strategy are better aligned.",

Restricted Securities Award (RSA)\n\nThe Restricted Securities Award (RSA), previously referred to as the LTA Minimum, is similar to /fixed remuneration as it is not subject to performance conditions. It is designed to motivate and reward a limited number of key executives to deliver on the Group's long term strategy and to allow them to have a sense of ownership and share in the value created for securityholders. The RSA (and previously referred to LTA Minimum) was discontinued from FY22 under the revised Executive Reward Strategy.\n\n## Arrangements for RSA Awards\n\n| RSA Design                 | How the RSA Works                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Performance Rights         | \u00b7 An annual grant of 'performance rights' is made to a limited number of executives on the Global  Leadership Team                                                                                                                   |\n|                            | \u00b7 However, following feedback from proxy-holders and other stakeholders, the RSA has no longer been o/ffered  from FY22                                                                                                              |\n|                            | \u00b7 The Board intends that the awards be settled in Lendlease securities, although some or all of the award may  be settled in cash at the Board's discretion                                                                          |\n|                            | \u00b7 Performance rights are rights to receive one Lendlease stapled security, or at the Board's discretion, cash or  other instruments of equivalent value                                                                              |\n| Vesting Period             | \u00b7 The /first tranche (i.e. 25%) will vest after three years and the second, third and fourth tranches will vest  progressively four, /five and six years after the grant date.                                                       |\n| Termination  of Employment | \u00b7 If the executive resigns and becomes engaged in activities that are competitive with the Group or is  terminated for cause, the unvested RSA is forfeited                                                                          |\n|                            | \u00b7 If the executive is terminated and if the Board considers vesting would provide a bene/fit that was  unwarranted or inappropriate, the Board has the discretion to lapse some or all performance rights prior  to the vesting date |\n|                            | \u00b7 For 'good leavers', the RSA grant may remain on foot, subject to the original terms.                                                                                                                                               |\n\n## 35.f.

Amounts Recognised in the Financial Statements\n\nLTI and LTA awards are valued using Monte-Carlo simulation methodology for the TSR component and the Black-Scholes-Merton model for the non-market based performance measures. Retention awards are valued by discounting the security price by the expected dividends assumed to be paid from the valuation date until the vesting date (if applicable). The model inputs include the Lendlease Group security price, a risk free interest rate, expected volatility and dividend yield. During the /financial year ended 30 June 2024, 3,080,628 awards were granted with a weighted average fair value of $6.65, and a $22 million expense was recognised in the Income Statement in relation to equity settled security based payment awards (June 2023: $49 million).",

Foreign Currency Translation\n\n## Functional and Presentation Currency\n\nItems included in the /financial statements of each of the Group's entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates (the functional currency). The consolidated /financial report is presented in Australian dollars, which is the Company's functional and presentation currency.\n\n## Transactions and Balances\n\nForeign currency transactions are translated into Australian dollars using the exchange rate on the date of the transactions. Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated to Australian dollars at balance date.\n\nForeign exchange gains or losses are recognised in the Income Statement for monetary assets and liabilities such as receivables and payables, except for qualifying cash /flow hedges and qualifying net investment hedges in foreign operations, which are recognised in other comprehensive income. Refer to Note 25 'Hedging' for further detail.\n\nTranslation di/fferences on non monetary items, such as equities held at fair value through pro/fit or loss, are reported as part of the fair value gain or loss.\n\n## Group Entities\n\nThe results and Statement of Financial Position of all Group entities that are not presented in Australian dollars (none of which has the currency of a hyperin/flationary economy) are translated as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Revenue and expenses are translated at average exchange rates (unless this average is not a reasonable approximation of the transaction rate, in which case revenue and expenses are translated at the date of the transactions)\n- \u00b7 Assets and liabilities for each Statement of Financial Position presented are translated at the closing rate at balance date\n- \u00b7 All resulting exchange di/fferences are recognised in other comprehensive income, in the foreign currency translation reserve.\n\nGoodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the closing rate.\n\n## 38.b. Goods and Services Tax\n\nRevenue, expenses and assets are recognised net of the amount of goods and services tax (GST), except where the amount of GST incurred is not recoverable from the taxation authority. In these circumstances, the GST is recognised as part of the cost of acquisition of the asset or as part of the expense.\n\nReceivables and payables are stated with the amount of GST included. The net amount of GST recoverable from, or payable to, the Australian Taxation O/ffice (ATO) is included as a current asset or liability in the Statement of Financial Position. Cash /flows are included in the Statement of Cash Flows on a gross basis. The GST components of cash /flows arising from investing and /financing activities which are recoverable from, or payable to, the ATO are classi/fied as operating cash /flows.",

The consolidated entity has applied current legislation and judicial precedent, including having regard to the Commissioner of Taxation's public guidance in Tax Ruling TR 2018/5 and Practical Compliance Guideline PCG 2018/19.\n- \u00b7 Foreign tax residency\n- The consolidated entity has applied current legislation, double tax agreements and where available judicial precedent in the determination of foreign tax residency.\n\n## Partnerships and Trusts\n\nAustralian tax law does not contain speci/fic residency tests for partnerships and trusts. Generally, these entities are taxed on a /flowthrough basis, meaning the partners and unitholders have the obligation to pay tax in relation to their involvement in the partnership or trust, so there is no need for a general residence test. Other jurisdictions such as the UK, Jersey and Singapore adopt similar positions. For this reason, the tax residence of partnerships (including UK limited liability partnerships (LLPs) disclosed as body corporates) has been disclosed as 'N/A' and the tax residence of trusts has been disclosed as the same tax residence of the relevant trust's trustee.\n\n## United States Limited Liability Companies (LLCs)\n\nAll of the consolidated entity's LLCs are disregarded for United States income tax purposes, meaning that the ultimate single member, being in every case either Lendlease Americas Inc. or Lendlease Americas Holdings Inc, has the obligation to pay tax in relation to their direct or indirect interest in the LLCs. The tax residencies disclosed for LLCs has been determined by reference to the tax residency of each LLC's ultimate single member.",

The Group contracts in a variety of ways. Each project has a different risk profile based on its individual contractual and delivery characteristics.\n\nCurrently, global market conditions are uncertain with disruption to supply chains and inflationary pressures. These conditions continue to create a challenging operating environment impacting productivity, expected timing of completion and expected costs to complete.\n\nConstruction revenue recognition is a key audit matter as judgement is required to assess the timing of recognition determined by the Group. Revenue on construction contracts is earned over time, typically using costs incurred as a proportion of total forecast costs as the measure of progress.\n\nEstimating total forecast costs to complete during project life is complex and requires\n\nOur procedures included:\n\n- \uf0b7 Evaluating and testing the Group's internal controls relating to review and approval of revenue and cost forecasting;\n- \uf0b7 Conducting visits to a selection of project sites to evidence physical progress and understand key risks;\n- \uf0b7 Selecting a sample of contracts for testing using:\n- \uf02d Data Analytic routines based on a number of quantitative and qualitative factors, related to size and risk of projects; and\n- \uf02d the Group's project reporting tool.\n- \uf0b7 For the sample selected, we:\n- \uf02d inquired with key project personnel to assess the project schedule, forecast costs, risks and opportunities, with involvement from KPMG engineering specialists where appropriate;\n- \uf02d read relevant contract terms and conditions to evaluate the inclusion of individual\n\nKey Audit Matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the Financial Report of the current period.\n\nThese matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the Financial Report as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.",

Changes to these cost estimates could give rise to variances in the amount of revenue recognised.\n\nThe revenue on construction contracts may also include variations and claims, which fall under either the variable consideration or contract modification requirements of AASB 15. It is the Group's policy to recognise these on a contract-by-contract basis when evidence supports that it is highly probable that a significant reversal in the amount of revenue recognised will not occur.\n\nThe assessment of revenue on construction contracts resulting from variations and claims was a focus of our audit due to the audit effort in assessing this across bespoke projects and contracting arrangements.\n\ncharacteristics and project risks in the Group's estimates;\n\n- \uf02d tested a sample of incurred costs to supplier invoices or other underlying documentation;\n- \uf02d tested forecast costs for labour, subcontractors, equipment, materials, and project overheads by comparing to actual incurred spend, committed future contracts and current market quotes, with specific consideration of inflation in our assessment of contingency; and\n- \uf02d tested the variations and claims recognised within revenue against the criteria for recognition in the accounting standards via inspection and assessment of:\n- o correspondence between the Group and the customer;\n- o the Group's legal basis for the variations and claims, including, where necessary, external legal opinions; and\n- o the Group's analysis of the amounts they consider meet the recognition requirement of highly probable, using our knowledge of the Group's historical experience in resolving variations and claims, and considering the commercial factors specific to each variation or claim and quality of information underpinning the amounts recognised.\n\n## Sale of Development Properties (A$1,149m)\n\nRefer to Note 4 'Revenue from Contracts with Customers' to the Financial Report\n\n## The key audit matter\n\n## How the matter was addressed in our audit\n\nThe Group develops for sale both built form products (for example residential apartments and mixed-use buildings which incorporate commercial and retail) and residential land lots. It is the Group's policy for development revenue to be recognised when control transfers to the purchaser, based on an assessment of the contractual terms of sale.\n\nThis was a key audit matter due to the volume of transactions that occur across multiple jurisdictions. In addition, the assessment of cost of sales includes judgement as cost allocation for site infrastructure costs is\n\nOur procedures included:\n\n- \uf0b7 Evaluating and testing the Group's internal controls relating to review and approval of development revenue and cost forecasting;\n- \uf0b7 Selecting a sample of settlements, across multiple jurisdictions, during the year.

The recoverability therefore of these capitalised development costs is a significant judgement made by the Group, and their assessment is based on forecasts of:\n\n- \uf0b7 sales prices; and\n- \uf0b7 construction and infrastructure costs to complete the development.\n\nWhere a development is forecast to be loss making and the inventory is no longer considered to be recoverable, the Group considers it to be impaired and it is their policy for an expense to be recognised.\n\nThis was a key audit matter for us due to:\n\nOur procedures included:\n\n- \uf0b7 Selecting a sample of projects for testing using:\n- \uf02d Data Analytic routines based on a number of quantitative and qualitative factors, related to size, duration and risk of projects; and\n- \uf02d the Group's project reporting tool.\n- \uf0b7 For the sample selected, we:\n- \uf02d compared expected sales prices to published industry forecasts and comparable sales prices achieved in the year, being alert to the impacts of current challenging market conditions;\n- \uf02d tested a sample of forecast construction and infrastructure costs to underlying supplier contracts, historical experience of similar costs, and our industry expectation of cost contingency levels and cost escalation assumptions; and\n- \uf02d assessed the volumes of sales expected each period and holding costs in light of current challenging market conditions, using our industry knowledge.",
