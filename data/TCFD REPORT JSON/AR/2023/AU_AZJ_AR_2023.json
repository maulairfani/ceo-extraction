Sustaining capex expected to be $600-$660m (including ~$40m of transformational project capital) and growth capex expected to be $250 - $300m. Key assumptions:\n\n- \u203a Network: revenue and EBITDA growth driven by a $125m increase in the (regulated) Maximum Allowable Revenue. Volumes are assumed at the approved regulatory forecast of 207.8mt\n- \u203a Coal: revenue and EBITDA growth with volumes expected to be higher than FY2023 (and revenue yield improvement)\n- \u203a Bulk: revenue and EBITDA growth with volumes expected to be higher than FY2023 and the full year inclusion of Bulk Central (and full realisation of targeted synergies)\n- \u203a Other: Containerised Freight expected to be broadly EBITDA neutral as national interstate services ramp up to full schedule by April 2024\n- \u203a No significant disruptions to supply chains (such as major derailments or extreme/ prolonged wet weather).\n\n- \u203a Commencement of services in April 2023 under the new Team Global Express contract for Containerised Freight.\n- \u203a The divestment of East Coast Rail was announced in December 2022 and completed in February 2023.\n- \u203a Final dividend declared of 8.0cps (60% franked) represents a payout ratio of 75% of underlying NPAT for continuing operations.",

        "page_content": "## Chairman's Report\n\nDear fellow shareholders\n\nI am pleased to present our FY2023 Annual Report.\n\nThe year presented a tough operating environment for Aurizon, with prolonged wet weather in eastern Australia significantly impacting volumes carried by the business. This was compounded by mine production issues, a major third-party derailment and labour shortages emerging for critical roles such as train drivers.\n\nAs a result, Underlying Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortisation (EBITDA) of $1,428 million in FY2023 was at the lower end of our revised guidance range of $1,420 million - $1,470 million. The Board has declared a final dividend of 8.0 cents per share, 60% franked. This will take total dividends for FY2023 to 15 cents. The dividend payout ratio is consistent with our commitment to maintain strong investment grade credit ratings during the current investment cycle for our Bulk and Containerised Freight businesses. Since FY2016, Aurizon has returned approximately $5 billion to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks.\n\nWe were delighted to progress major strategic initiatives during FY2023, which are underpinning the transformation, diversification and growth of our business. We now have a truly national footprint with track infrastructure, rollingstock, terminal and port assets, together with a highly-capable team to deliver on the next phase of growth for Aurizon. Key initiatives put in place during FY2023 included:\n\n- \u203a Completion of the $1.4 billion acquisition of One Rail Australia in Central Australia (now called Bulk Central), successful divestment of East Coast Rail and the subsequent and seamless integration of Bulk Central into our national Bulk business;\n- \u203a Securing a key strategic position in Australia's growing containerised freight market, with the announcement of a new 11-year national linehaul contract with Team Global Express (TGE); and\n- \u203a Investing approximately $210 million in new rollingstock, track infrastructure, terminals, and port equipment to support growth in Bulk and Containerised Freight. We expect to invest a further $250 - $300 million in growth capital in these businesses during FY2024.\n\nThese initiatives are the building blocks for the continued commercial success of Aurizon, as we move to capitalise on growth in emerging markets for the Australian economy. This was the core message delivered by our Managing Director & CEO Andrew Harding and our senior leadership team at our 2023 Investor Day which was held in Darwin in July 2023. At this event, Andrew detailed our updated strategic aims:\n\n- \u203a Continue to optimise the highly resilient and cash-generative businesses of Network and Coal;\n- \u203a Aspire to achieve a larger share of the available Bulk products supply chain market; and\n- \u203a Establish a nationally significant containerised freight supply chain for customers.\n\nThe Board is committed to creating a more diversified and valuable business aligned to changes in the Australian and global economies, while maintaining the strong and stable cash flows that are core to Aurizon. We recognise the global energy transition comes with challenges and opportunities. We will continue to grow non-coal revenue streams, re-balancing our portfolio towards rapidly-growing markets. The expected growth in those businesses recognises our leading position in key commodity-rich regions of Australia, with strong exposure to new-economy commodities such as bauxite, copper, nickel, phosphate, rare earths, and grain. Australia is well placed to provide these commodities to the world for decades to come, and likewise Aurizon, as the nation's largest integrated rail provider, is in a strong position to capitalise on this opportunity.\n\nIn closing, I would like to acknowledge the ongoing commitment of our employees across Aurizon in delivering safe and reliable services to our customers. What has been abundantly clear over recent years - during COVID-19 and more recently during the extreme weather events - is that we have a highly-capable and resilient team of employees. The Board is also pleased to note the continuing improvements across key safety metrics during FY2023. Andrew Harding shares more detail in his report on the following page.\n\nDuring the year, we announced changes to the Aurizon Board as we continue to renew and add diversity to our Board composition. Tim Longsta/ff, a chartered accountant with a 25-year career in investment banking, joined as a non-executive director on 1 June 2023. Samantha Tough, a lawyer with extensive experience in executive and director roles, will join as a non-executive director on 1 September 2023. I would also like to acknowledge Kate Vidgen who retired as a non-executive director of Aurizon on 31 May 2023. I would like to thank Kate for her dedication and hard work over the past seven years. Kate is an outstanding director who has made a significant contribution to Aurizon and we wish her the very best for the future.\n\nFinally, thank you to our shareholders for your continued support through a significant period of transformation for Aurizon. The Board is excited with the changes happening in the business and the growth we have in front of us, as we build on our core strengths and leverage the national and broader range of services that Aurizon is now able to o/ffer our customers. As we embed this strategy and execute the various initiatives outlined above, we look forward to continuing to deliver value and returns for shareholders.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTim Poole\n\nChairman 14 August 2023",

        "page_content": "## Managing Director & CEO's Report\n\nDear fellow shareholders\n\nI am pleased to report strong progress during FY2023 in implementing a range of key initiatives and investments that are supporting national expansion and diversification, and underpinning future revenue and volume growth for Aurizon. This activity is focussed on Bulk and Containerised Freight - two businesses for which we have significant aspirations over the next decade and beyond. I will cover this work and the performance of Aurizon's business units later in my report.\n\nFirst, I will address operational safety performance. While overall safety metrics improved in FY2023, unfortunately a number of injuries were sustained by our Train Crew in level crossing collisions. Level crossing risk remains one of the areas of most concern for the rail industry, and we are stepping up education and awareness activity in the communities where we operate, as well as advocacy and engagement with key stakeholders.\n\nAurizon uses two primary safety metrics to measure safety performance: Total Recordable Injury Frequency Rate (TRIFR) and potential and actual Serious Injury and Fatality Frequency Rate (SIFR(a+p)). In FY2023, TRIFR improved by 2% and SIFR(a+p) improved 56%. These numbers do not include the newly acquired Bulk Central business, which will be integrated into enterprise-wide safety metrics from FY2024. Further details are available in the Operating and Financial Review.\n\nAs the Chairman outlined in his report, the Company had a challenging year from an operational perspective, including prolonged wet weather. This impacted our volumes and our financial results for FY2023. Underlying Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortisation (EBITDA) was $1,428 million, at the lower end of our revised guidance range. Below is an overview of the performance and some key initiatives in each of the business units.\n\n## Bulk\n\nThere was a significant increase in earnings for Bulk in FY2023, primarily driven by Bulk Central which contributed its first year of revenue (following the completion of the One Rail acquisition on 29 July 2022). Tonnes increased 34% to 68 million, with EBITDA increasing $79 million to $214 million, a 59% increase compared to FY2022. We were pleased to secure a number of new contracts including:\n\n- \u203a Northparkes, NSW for the port services of copper concentrate\n- \u203a IPL, Queensland for road, rail and stevedoring of sulphur\n- \u203a Aeris Resources, NSW for road, rail and stevedoring for base metals.\n\nWe have continued to invest in additional locomotives and wagons, port assets and terminals, as well as upgrading track infrastructure to support the growth of new and existing Bulk customers. A good example is the installation of improved rail infrastructure and the introduction of higher capacity locomotives for Gypsum Australia in South Australia.\n\n## Coal\n\nCoal haulage volumes decreased 5% to 185 million tonnes in FY2023 and was the primary reason for a 16% decrease in EBITDA to $455 million, compared to the previous year. During FY2023, the Coal business secured a number of contracts including:\n\n- \u203a 10-year contract with Malabar for the Maxwell Underground Mine, NSW\n- \u203a 5-year contract with New Wilkie Energy, Queensland\n- \u203a BMA Rail maintenance\n- \u203a 5-year contract with SIMEC Mining for the Tahmoor Underground Mine, NSW (signed in August 2023).\n\nOur Coal haulage business remains a highlye/fficient, cash-generative business for Aurizon, serving metallurgical and thermal coal producers in Queensland and New South Wales. We are continuing to implement key technology and transformation initiatives for Coal, including the TrainGuard project which is supporting safer and more e/fficient train operations.\n\n## Containerised Freight\n\nIn February 2023, we secured the largest ever non-coal contract for Aurizon with the new national linehaul services for Team Global Express (TGE). We are currently ramping up to a full service profile for TGE, with all east-west (Melbourne-Perth) and north-south services (Melbourne-Sydney-Brisbane) to be in place by the first half of calendar year 2024. With TGE as the cornerstone, we will build volumes with other customers along these corridors.\n\nThe Containerised Freight business leverages assets and track infrastructure across a national footprint which are already part of our existing Bulk business. This includes, for example, Bulk's investment in harbour cranes at the Port of Darwin. Not only will this support the growth of export volumes, but it will also allow us to develop opportunities for land-bridging imports through Darwin to southern capitals.\n\nWe see land-bridging as a natural extension of the national container services we are providing to customers, with a relatively modest investment profile to support the initial stage of land-bridging.\n\n## Network\n\nThe Network business achieved EBITDA of $813 million, an increase of 1% compared to FY2022. Tonnages across the Central Queensland Coal Network increased by 1% to 207.6 million tonnes, though this was lower than expected due to prolonged wet weather during the second and third quarters of FY2023. Aurizon Network operates Australia's largest rail supply chain for export coal, with 2,670 kilometres of track connecting customers from more than 40 mines to five export terminals located across three ports. The business remains core to Aurizon's commercial strength and is responsible for more than 50% of total Company earnings, which in turn, supports important investment in other parts of Aurizon's business.\n\n## Sustainability\n\nAurizon continues to develop the resilience and sustainability of our business, with a target of achieving net-zero operational emissions by 2050. We have a range of initiatives underway to reduce emissions which are detailed in our Climate Strategy and Action Plan and our Sustainability Report, available on our website. In May 2023, at Redbank in Queensland, we launched work on a prototype for a zeroemissions capable freight locomotive, a first for Australia. Our diesel locomotive fleet is responsible for the majority of our greenhouse gas emissions, so this is an exciting project as we aim to develop the next generation of lowcarbon freight solutions for our customers and to contribute to lower emissions in Australia's transport sector.\n\nIn closing, I extend my gratitude to our 5,700 employees across Australia for their dedication and commitment in delivering safe and reliable services for our customers. We are transforming and growing this business for the benefit of customers, communities, shareholders and the Australian economy.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAndrew Harding\n\nManaging Director & CEO 14 August 2023",

This segment also manages the Tarcoola-to-Darwin rail infrastructure, the intrastate rail freight network in South Australia, and containerised freight services between Adelaide and Darwin.\n\n## Other\n\nThis segment includes other containerised freight, which is not considered a separate reportable segment, as well as other revenue and central costs not allocated such as Board, Managing Director & CEO, Company Secretary, strategy and investor relations.\n\n## Review of operations\n\nA review of the Group's operations for the financial year and the results of those operations are contained in the Operating and Financial Review as set out on pages 13 - 30 of this report.\n\n## Dividends\n\nA final dividend of 10.9 cents per fully paid ordinary share (100% franked) was paid on 21 September 2022 and an interim dividend of 7.0 cents per fully paid ordinary share (100% franked) was paid on 29 March 2023.\n\nFurther details of dividends provided for, or paid, are set out in note 15 to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nSince the end of the financial year, the Directors have declared to pay a final dividend of 8.0 cents per fully paid ordinary share. The dividend will be 60% franked and is payable on 27 September 2023.\n\n## State of a/ffairs\n\nThe acquisition of One Rail Australia completed on 29 July 2022. Refer to note 22 for further information.\n\nIn the opinion of the Directors, there were no other significant changes in the state of a/ffairs of the Company that occurred during the financial year under review.\n\n## Events since the end of the financial year\n\nThe Directors are not aware of any events or developments which are not set out in this report or note 31 of the Financial Report that have, or would have, a significant e/ffect on the Group's state of a/ffairs, its operations or its expected results in future years.\n\n## Likely developments\n\nInformation about likely developments in the operations of the Group and the expected results of those operations are covered in the Chairman's Report set out on page 2 of this report and the Managing Director & CEO's Report set out on page 3 of this report, and at a high level in the outlook provided on page 1 of this report.\n\nIn the opinion of the Directors, disclosure of any further information would be likely to result in unreasonable prejudice to the Group.\n\n## Sustainability performance\n\nAurizon is committed to managing its operational activities and services in a sustainable manner and has continued to monitor performance against key sustainability targets and objectives, which include:\n\n- \u203a a net-zero operational emissions (Scope 1 and 2) by 2050 target\n- \u203a an additional emissions intensity reduction target of 10% by 2030 1 to maintain an emphasis on improving existing capabilities and assets in the near term\n- \u203a two primary safety metrics to measure safety outcomes across the enterprise: Total Recordable Injury Frequency Rate (TRIFR) and Serious Injury and Fatality Frequency Rate (SIFRa+p)\n- \u203a gender representation on the Board\n- \u203a representation of women in senior executive roles\n- \u203a representation of women in the workforce\n- \u203a representation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander men and women in the workforce.\n\nDetails on our progress against the targets and objectives, together with the steps that are taken by the Board to ensure there is e/ffective governance and oversight, are published in Aurizon's Sustainability Report.\n\n## Environmental and Cultural Heritage regulation and performance\n\nAurizon is committed to managing its operational activities and services in an environmentally responsible manner to meet legal, social and moral obligations. To deliver on this commitment, Aurizon seeks to comply with all applicable laws and regulations that have a planning, environmental or cultural heritage focus.\n\nIntegration of Bulk Central (formerly One Rail Australia) presented opportunities to streamline statutory licences (e.g. Environment Protection Licences in South Australia for rollingstock operation) held by both organisations, and to commence work aligning Cultural Heritage governance processes.",

        "page_content": "In FY2023, statutory approvals obtained and land use planning enabling Bulk growth and expansion included:\n\n- \u203a the Stuart Industrial Subdivision (Far North Queensland) through the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (Cth)\n- \u203a rail infrastructure expansion at the Port of Townsville, optimising rail-ship freight transfer\n- \u203a Kwinana yard optimisation approvals (Western Australia (WA)) pursuant to the Planning and Development Act 2005 (WA).\n\nAurizon maintained compliance with stringent noise requirements related to locomotive engines and wheel/rail interface outlined in both New South Wales (NSW) and South Australia EPA rollingstock licencing. This performance contributed to the NSW EPA removing noise pollution studies directed at idling, horn use, braking, bunching, and stretching from Aurizon's licence.\n\nThe National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting Act 2007 (NGER) (Cth) requires the Group to report its annual greenhouse gas emissions and energy use. The Group has implemented systems and processes for the collection and calculation of the data required and is registered under the NGER Act. At the close of the sixth Emissions Reduction Fund Safeguard Mechanism (Safeguard) compliance period (ended on 30 June 2022), three of Aurizon's NGER facilities were captured. Through e/ffective management of the Company's emissions, Aurizon remained below its respective baselines and achieved full compliance with the Safeguard. In March 2023, Aurizon successfully transitioned its three NGER facilities to a single National Transport Facility with a production-adjusted baseline.\n\nAurizon had extensive engagement with the Federal Government regarding the Safeguard Mechanism Scheme reforms, which commenced on 1 July 2023, and is undertaking appropriate steps to prepare for and e/ffectively manage obligations associated with this regulatory change.\n\nFurther details of the Company's climate and environmental performance, including climaterelated risks and assumptions, will be published in Aurizon's 2023 Sustainability Report, which will be published in October 2023.\n\n## Environmental and Cultural Heritage prosecutions\n\nAurizon did not incur any monetary fines, nor was it subject to any prosecutions related to environment or cultural heritage regulations in FY2023.\n\n## Risk management\n\nAurizon recognises that risk is characterised by both threat and opportunity, and manages risk to enhance opportunities and reduce threats to sustain shareholder value. Aurizon fosters a risk-aware culture through the application of high-quality, integrated risk assessments to support informed decision-making.\n\nThe Board is ultimately responsible for risk management, which considers a wide range of risks within strategic planning. Aurizon has a commitment to e/ffective risk management as a key element of business success.\n\nThe Audit, Governance & Risk Management Committee monitors management's performance against Aurizon's risk management framework, including whether it is operating within the risk appetite set by the Board (See Principle 7 on page 52 of this report). The Company's Risk and Assurance Function is responsible for providing oversight of the risk management framework and assurance on the management of significant risks to the Managing Director & CEO and the Board.\n\nAurizon's risk-aware culture has an emphasis on frontline accountability for e/ffective risk management. The consideration of risk features heavily in our thinking, from the framing of strategy through to informing decision-making. Aurizon's Enterprise Risk Management Framework and Appetite and supporting Risk Assessment Procedure are aligned to the international standard for risk management (AS/NZS ISO 31000:2018), supports the identification, assessment and reporting of risk across the business, and includes both financial and non-financial risks.\n\nProcesses exist for the prevention, detection and management of fraud within the Company, and for fair dealing in matters pertaining to fraud.\n\nFurther details of risks and risk management are set out on pages 23-30 of the Directors' Report.\n\n## CEO and CFO declaration\n\nThe Managing Director & CEO and Chief Financial O/fficer (CFO) have provided a written statement to the Board in accordance with Section 295A of the Corporations Act.\n\nWith regard to the financial records and systems of risk management and internal compliance in this written statement, the Board received assurance from the Managing Director & CEO and CFO that the declaration was founded on a sound system of risk management and internal control, and that the system was operating e/ffectively in all material respects in relation to the reporting of financial risks.\n\n## Indemnification and insurance of o/fficers\n\nThe Company's Constitution provides that the Company may indemnify any person who is, or has been, an o/fficer of the Group, including the Directors and Company Secretary, against liabilities incurred while acting as such o/fficers to the maximum extent permitted by law.\n\nThe Company has entered into a Deed of Access, Indemnity and Insurance with each of the Company's Directors. No Director or o/fficer of the Company has received benefits under an indemnity from the Company during or since the end of the year.\n\nThe Company has paid a premium for insurance for Directors and o/fficers of the Group. This insurance is against a liability for costs and expenses incurred by o/fficers in defending civil or criminal proceedings involving them as such o/fficers, with some exceptions. The contract of insurance prohibits disclosure of the nature of the liability insured against and the amount of the premium paid.",

The inclusion of Bulk Central was the largest contributor to the increase in Bulk EBITDA with the acquisition completed in July 2022. Network volumes were below the regulatory forecast by 19mt resulting in an under-recovery of allowable revenue, triggering regulatory revenue protection mechanisms including $76m of Take-or-Pay revenue. When combined with a WIRP termination fee, Network EBITDA was 1% higher. For Coal, lower volumes (5%) from the prolonged wet weather, along with higher Network Take-or-Pay (non-pass through) expense was the driver of lower EBITDA. Other EBITDA was lower due to the prior period divestment of the Rockhampton workshops and the recognition of a $15m long service leave provision adjustment.\n\nRevenue increased by 14%, driven by Bulk and Network, more than o/ffsetting lower revenue in Coal and Other.\n\nOperating costs increased by $475m (30%), primarily due to the inclusion of Bulk Central. Costs also increased due to higher fuel and energy (largely pass-through), more than o/ffsetting transformation benefits.\n\nEBIT declined by $113m (13%) primarily due to increased depreciation ($74m or 13%) with the inclusion of Bulk Central, higher capital expenditure in Bulk and Containerised Freight to support growth and increased ballast and rail renewals in Network, and lower EBITDA.\n\nROIC was 2.8ppts lower at 7.5% due to lower EBIT and higher invested capital.\n\n## Reconciliation to statutory earnings\n\nUnderlying earnings is a non-statutory measure and is the primary reporting measure used by management and the Group's chief operating decision-making bodies for managing and assessing the financial performance of the business. Underlying earnings is derived by adjusting statutory earnings for significant items as noted in the following table:\n\n| ($M)                                                        | FY2023   | FY2022   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------|----------|----------|\n| Continuing operations                                       |          |          |\n| Underlying EBITDA                                           | 1,428    | 1,467    |\n| Depreciation and amortisation                               | (666)    | (592)    |\n| Underlying EBIT                                             | 762      | 875      |\n| Continuing operations significant items - acquisition costs | (49)     | (14)     |\n| Statutory EBIT                                              | 713      | 861      |\n| Net finance costs                                           | (230)    | (125)    |\n| Statutory Profit before tax                                 | 483      | 736      |\n| Income tax expense                                          | (159)    | (223)    |\n| Statutory NPAT - Continuing operations                      | 324      | 513      |\n| Continuing operations significant items, net of tax         | 43       | 12       |\n| Underlying NPAT - Continuing operations                     | 367      | 525      |\n| Statutory NPAT - Discontinued operations                    | (48)     | -        |\n| Discontinued operations significant items, net of tax       | 82       | -        |\n| Underlying NPAT - Discontinued operations                   | 34       | -        |\n| Statutory NPAT - Continuing and discontinued operations     | 276      | 513      |\n| Underlying NPAT - Continuing and discontinued operations    | 401      | 525      |\n\nAcquisition costs for One Rail Australia of $49m ($43m post tax) includes landholder duty, advisory fees and other costs. This amount has been expensed to profit or loss during the year and classified in other expenses. The loss from discontinued operations after tax of $48m for the year includes underlying net profit after tax of $34m, adjusted for significant items including impairment expense of $57m ($75m pre-tax), sale and divestment costs $23m ($26m pre-tax) and loss on disposal $2m ($2m pre-tax).",

Other non-current assets increased by $141m, including a $81m favourable movement on derivative financial instruments predominately due to floating interest on borrowings being swapped for fixed interest payments.\n\nTotal borrowings increased by $1,921m due to the acquisition of One Rail Australia and funding for capital purchases to support Bulk and Containerised Freight growth.\n\nOther current liabilities, excluding borrowings increased by $31m largely due to an increase in trade and other payables of $68m due to an increase in capital accruals as a result of the Bulk Central acquisition and capital purchases and an increase in other current liabilities of $26m including contract and lease liabilities. This was partly o/ffset by a decrease in current tax liabilities of $69m due to the recognition of a current tax receivable in FY2023.\n\nOther non-current liabilities increased by $110m largely due to a $143m increase in net deferred tax liabilities due to accelerated fixed asset adjustments for the Bulk Central acquisition, o/ffset by a $14m favourable movement on derivative financial instruments and a reduction of $29m for the amortisation of contract liabilities.\n\nGearing (net debt / (net debt + equity)) was 53.7% as at 30 June 2023 reflecting higher borrowings.",

This predominately relates to an increase in trade and other receivables due to higher revenue and Take-or-Pay accruals for FY2023\n- \u203a increase in income taxes paid in comparison to the prior year which included a tax benefit recognised on the disposal of shares held in Aquila.\n\nNet cash outflow from investing activities from continuing operations increased by $1,661m (315%) to $2,189m, predominately due to the acquisition of One Rail Australia, an increase in shareholding for the Ox Mountain joint venture and an increase in capital expenditure.\n\nNet cash inflow from financing activities from continuing operations increased by $2,037m to $1,269m due to the net drawdown of borrowings to fund the acquisition of One Rail Australia and greater capital expenditure in comparison to the prior year which included a net repayment of borrowings and a reduction in dividends paid. This was partly o/ffset by interest paid due to the increased borrowings.\n\n- 5   Free Cash Flow defined as net cash flow from operating activities (less non-growth capex) and interest paid. It excludes growth capex of $203m, the acquisition of One Rail Australia ($1,404m), cash costs associated with the acquisition ($49m pre-tax) and the purchase of an additional investment in Ox Mountain ($30m).",

Statutory income tax expense for continuing operations was $159m with an income tax benefit of $6m from the payment of acquisition costs which are expected to be tax deductible and have been treated as a significant item.\n\nThe Group statutory e/ffective tax rate was 35.6%, which is more than 30% due to non-deductible landholder duty arising in respect of the acquisition of Bulk Central, non-deductible transaction costs in respect of the disposal of ORAH and a non-deductible impairment in discontinued operations. The Group statutory cash tax rate was 11.1%, which is less than 30% due to accelerated tax depreciation deductions from Bulk Central, immediate tax deduction of eligible capital expenditure under the temporary full expensing measure, and the treatment of Takeor-Pay income as not derived for tax purposes at 30 June 2023. Take-or-Pay will be assessable in FY2024 once invoiced to customers. The underlying e/ffective tax rate 6 for FY2024 is expected to be in the range of 29-31% and the underlying cash tax rate 7 is expected to remain approximately 25% for the short to medium term.\n\nAurizon publishes additional tax information in accordance with the voluntary Tax Transparency Code in its Sustainability Report. See the Sustainability section of the Aurizon website for further detail.\n\n## Discontinued operations\n\nThe acquisition of One Rail Australia on 29 July 2022 comprised two business segments, including East Coast Rail, a coal haulage business in New South Wales (NSW) and Queensland (QLD).\n\nThe investments held in the East Coast Rail entities were transferred to ORAH (formerly NHK Pty Ltd), a subsidiary of the Company, on 29 July 2022 and classified as a discontinued operation held for sale. The Company signed a binding agreement with Magnetic Rail Group Pty Ltd (Magnetic) on 16 December 2022 to sell 100% of the shares of ORAH and the sale completed on 17 February 2023 for consideration of $438m including completion adjustments. The total consideration includes $313m cash proceeds received on completion of the sale and $125m cash proceeds receivable in February 2024. On completion of the sale, Magnetic assumed ORAH's existing borrowings of $474m.",

Aurizon hauls around half of Australia's export coal volume. Coal hauled is split approximately evenly between metallurgical coal and thermal coal, with demand linked to Asian steel production and energy generation, respectively.\n\nAurizon transports coal from mines in the Newlands, Goonyella, Blackwater, Moura and West Moreton systems in QLD and the Hunter Valley and Illawarra coal systems in NSW, to domestic customers and coal export terminals.\n\n## FINANCIAL SUMMARY\n\n| ($M)                          | FY2023   | FY2022   | VARIANCE   |\n|-------------------------------|----------|----------|------------|\n| Revenue                       |          |          |            |\n| Above Rail                    | 1,175    | 1,195    | (2%)       |\n| Track Access                  | 350      | 360      | (3%)       |\n| Other                         | 6        | 4        | 50%        |\n| Total revenue                 | 1,531    | 1,559    | (2%)       |\n| Track Access costs            | (400)    | (376)    | (6%)       |\n| Operating costs               | (676)    | (642)    | (5%)       |\n| EBITDA                        | 455      | 541      | (16%)      |\n| Depreciation and amortisation | (204)    | (208)    | 2%         |\n| EBIT                          | 251      | 333      | (25%)      |\n\n## METRICS\n\n|                                                            | FY2023   | FY2022   | VARIANCE   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------|----------|----------|------------|\n| Total tonnes hauled (m)                                    | 185.0    | 194.0    | (5%)       |\n| CQCN                                                       | 133.6    | 141.1    | (5%)       |\n| NSW & SEQ                                                  | 51.4     | 52.9     | (3%)       |\n| Contract utilisation                                       | 80%      | 84%      | (4ppt)     |\n| Total NTK (b)                                              | 42.2     | 45.2     | (7%)       |\n| CQCN                                                       | 33.0     | 35.3     | (7%)       |\n| NSW & SEQ                                                  | 9.2      | 9.9      | (7%)       |\n| Average haul length (km)                                   | 228      | 233      | (2%)       |\n| Total revenue / NTK ($/'000 NTK)                           | 36.3     | 34.5     | 5%         |\n| Above Rail Revenue / NTK ($/'000 NTK)                      | 27.8     | 26.4     | 5%         |\n| Operating Ratio                                            | 83.6%    | 78.6%    | (5.0ppt)   |\n| Opex / NTK ($/'000 NTK)                                    | 30.3     | 27.1     | (12%)      |\n| Opex / NTK (excluding access costs) ($/'000 NTK)           | 20.9     | 18.8     | (11%)      |\n| Locomotive productivity ('000 NTK / Active locomotive day) | 373.2    | 389.1    | (4%)       |\n| Active locomotives (as at 30 June)                         | 311      | 314      | (1%)       |\n| Wagon productivity ('000 NTK / Active wagon day)           | 14.2     | 14.7     | (3%)       |\n| Active wagons (as at 30 June)                              | 8,201    | 8,285    | (1%)       |\n| Payload (tonnes)                                           | 7,859    | 7,938    | (1%)       |\n\n## Coal performance overview\n\nCoal EBITDA decreased $86m (16%) to $455m primarily due to a decrease in volumes, higher Network Take-or-Pay (non-pass through) expense and costs due to wage and materials escalation.\n\nVolumes decreased 9.0mt (5%) to 185.0mt with reductions in the Central Queensland Coal Network (CQCN), NSW and South-East Queensland (SEQ).\n\n- \u203a Across the CQCN, volumes decreased by 7.5mt (5%) to 133.6mt with performance impacted by a range of factors including prolonged wet weather, numerous incidents including a major third-party derailment, mine production issues and labour availability. This was partly o/ffset by increased railings from the Anglo contract.\n- \u203a In NSW and SEQ, volumes decreased by 1.5mt (3%) to 51.4mt due to end of contracts for Yancoal Moolarben and New Acland in addition to significant wet weather in 1HFY2023, partly o/ffset by improved operational performance in 2HFY2023.",

        "page_content": "Coal revenue decreased by $28m (2%) to $1,531m largely due to the reduction in volumes. Revenue yield improved due to CPI-linked price escalation and higher fuel revenue from higher prices. Above Rail revenue per NTK increased by 5% driven by CPI-linked price escalation, partly o/ffset by the contract cessations detailed above and the impact of a contract rollover.\n\nTotal operating costs increased by $58m (6%) to $1,076m largely due to Network Take-or-Pay (non-pass through), higher fuel costs and higher wage and materials escalation. The major drivers of these movements are:\n\n- \u203a track access costs increased by $24m (6%) due to Network Take-or-Pay (non-pass through) and higher CQCN electric access costs partly o/ffset by lower volumes\n- \u203a other operating costs increased $34m (5%) primarily due to higher fuel relating to higher prices in addition to higher traincrew and maintenance costs impacted by higher inflation on labour and materials.\n\nDepreciation decreased $4m (2%), resulting in an EBIT decrease of 25% against the prior year.\n\nOperationally, key productivity metrics were lower compared to the prior year due to lower volumes.

The status of key aspects of UT5 are summarised below.\n\n## Capacity Assessments\n\n- \u203a The QCA published the Independent Expert's (IE) Initial Capacity Assessment Report (ICAR) on 1 November 2021 which identified Existing Capacity Deficits (ECD) within each Coal System.\n- \u203a On 12 November 2021, Network provided the Chair of the Rail Industry Group (RIG) and the QCA its preliminary response to the ICAR, which set out the proposed options to address the ECD identified in each Coal System. Network provided a Detailed Report in response to the ICAR on 14 March 2022.\n- \u203a On 16 November 2022, the QCA made an initial determination on Transitional Arrangements proposed by Network to be implemented, the most notable being the installation of remote-control signalling in the Newlands System which the IE subsequently assessed as being prudent and e/fficient.\n\n- \u203a On 23 March 2023, the QCA approved amendments to UT5 to allow for further studies on Transitional Arrangements, recovery of reasonable costs incurred by Network in undertaking those studies and the staged implementation of any initiatives.\n- \u203a The QCA published the IE's Annual Capacity Assessment Report 2023 (ACAR) on 29 June 2023. The ACAR identified some di/fferences between it and the findings in the ICAR in relation to the average annual deliverable network capacity of each coal system for the period FY2022 - FY2024, when measured as a percentage of the current contracted capacity for each coal system, which are as follows:\n- \u00b7  Goonyella System has improved by ~5% to ~98%\n- \u00b7  Blackwater System has improved by ~8% to ~104%\n- \u00b7 GAPE System is slightly lower by 1% to 63%;\n- \u00b7  Moura System has improved by ~6% to ~99%\n- \u00b7  Newlands System has improved by 4% to 70%.\n\n## Report Date and Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC)\n\n- \u203a The QCA-approved reference tari/ffs assumed an uplift in the WACC to 6.3% would be e/ffected from 1 March 2020. As a result of the delay in the ICAR being published, there was an over-collection of access charges (the di/fference between 5.9% and 6.3%) in FY2022, which will be returned to Access Holders as part of the FY2022 Revenue Adjustment Amount, reflected in FY2024 Access Tari/ffs.\n- \u203a On 15 December 2022, the QCA rejected the FY2022 Revenue Adjustment Amount submission, taking the view that the WACC uplift did not apply from 12 November 2021 but instead from 14 March 2022 (the date upon which Network submitted its Detailed Report in response to the ICAR).\n- \u203a Network considers it met the requirements of the Report Date when it notified the Chair of the RIG of its Preliminary Response to the ICAR on 12 November 2021, resulting in an increase in Network's WACC from 5.9% to 6.3%. The WACC adjustment associated with a 14 March 2022 Report Date would see an additional return to Access holders of $9m in FY2024 tari/ffs.\n- \u203a To allow any dependent regulatory processes to continue to progress, on 20 January 2023, Network submitted an amended FY2022 Revenue Adjustment Amounts submission in compliance with the QCA's decision and reserved its rights in relation to the proper interpretation of the Report Date. On the same day, Network lodged an application with the Supreme Court of Queensland to appeal the QCA decision, seeking a declaration from the court about the proper interpretation of the definition of the Report Date. The Supreme Court hearing took place on 14 June 2023.\n- \u203a On 28 July 2023, the Supreme Court dismissed Network's application and decided that the Report Date is 14 March 2022. Network is considering the judgement and its next steps. At this time, there is no requirement for any further adjustment to FY2024 tari/ffs.\n\n## Performance Rebate\n\n- \u203a The Performance Rebate mechanism in UT5 came into e/ffect on the 'Report Date'. The Performance Rebate is payable if an End User does not receive its contracted Train Service Entitlement due to a performance breach by Network as determined by the IE under UT5.\n- \u203a In accordance with the terms of UT5, stakeholders requested the QCA undertake a review of the Performance Rebate mechanism and more specifically whether the Rebate Objectives set out in UT5 had been met in a material way.\n- \u203a On 23 March 2023, the QCA issued a Draft Decision recommending that no changes be made to the UT5 Rebate mechanism. This Draft Decision resulted in Network engaging with stakeholders, which concluded with Network responding to the Draft Decision with voluntary UT5 amendments agreed with stakeholders relating to further information gathering processes to support the IE's annual rebate calculation.\n- \u203a Due to Network's response to the Draft Decision, on 29 June 2023 the QCA provided its Final Decision determining that the Performance Rebate mechanism had not met the defined Rebate Objectives in a material way and that drafting changes were required to UT5 in the form provided to the QCA by Network.\n- \u203a Network responded to the Final Decision on 30 June 2023 with a DAAU with the stakeholder agreed amendments.",

The reset process involves the establishment of:\n- \u00b7  Preliminary Reset Values in FY2023 to form the basis of tari/ffs that will apply in FY2024. On 25 May 2023, the QCA approved Network's preliminary Reset Values.\n- \u00b7  Final Reset Values will be determined in FY2024. On 31 July 2023, Network submitted final Reset Values to the QCA for approval.\n- \u203a Preliminary Allowable Revenues and Reference Tari/ffs for FY2024 will be based on the QCA's approved preliminary WACC of 8.18% and opening FY2024 RAB Value of $6.2bn 10 (including Access Facilitation Deeds in respect of mine specific infrastructure of $0.3bn).\n- \u203a Network's final Reset Values submission proposed a final reset WACC of 8.51% based on a risk-free rate of 3.87% and a debt risk premium of 2.48%. Network is providing additional information to the QCA in support of its submission prior to it being published. Network's proposed final Reset Values remain subject to approval by the QCA, following a period of stakeholder consultation.\n- \u203a While the final Reset Values will take e/ffect from 1 July 2023, FY2024 Allowable Revenues and Tari/ffs will not be amended during that year to reflect the QCA's decision on the final Reset Values. The di/fference between the preliminary and final Reset Allowable Revenues for FY2024 (1 July 2023 to 30 June 2024) will be reconciled through the usual Revenue Adjustment Amounts (Revenue Cap) process in two years' time and will be incorporated into FY2026 Reference Tari/ffs.\n\n## Operational update\n\n## During FY2023:\n\n- \u203a CQCN volumes increased by 1% to 207.6mt.

This could occur due to an inability to  retain and extend existing contracts, identify and execute  suitable growth opportunities, a lack of available resources  and funding or other associated factors. Materialisation of these risks could result in financial                                                                                                                                                                                 | SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE LIMITED INFLUENCE | A clear strategy has been developed to  achieve this aspiration by diversifying our  Bulk portfolio and expanding our supply  chain services. To support the delivery  of Bulk Growth strategy, allocation has  been made of appropriate resources,  funding and expertise, along with the                                                                                                                                              |\n| Expansion of  Containerised  Freight | Aurizon recently expanded services as part of a  containerised freight service o/ffering, leveraging existing  national footprint and expertise. As this service o/ffering  expands, Aurizon is exposed to risk, including an inability  to deliver suitable growth opportunities to capitalise on  the demand for services, as a result of ine/ffective planning,  insu/fficient talent, resources and assets. Materialisation of these risks could result in financial  losses, stranded assets, negative investor sentiment,  reputational damage and failure to achieve  strategic objectives. | SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE LIMITED INFLUENCE | Aurizon has formulated a strategy  to facilitate the expansion of our  Containerised Freight service o/ffering. This strategy includes accessing and  developing key terminals and pathing,  procuring and managing the required  rollingstock and other assets, and  implementing suitable IT systems. It also  includes leveraging existing containerised  freight expertise and operations and  recruiting additional personnel with |\n| Fleet Strategy                       | Aurizon's ability to e/ffectively serve its customers is  largely dependent on its ability to make optimal use of  its long-life operational assets. Suboptimal management  of the Aurizon fleet resulting in degraded operational  performance could result in financial losses attributable  to performance penalties, foregone demand or failure  to deliver on key strategic objectives, such as growing                                                                                                                                                                                       | SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE LIMITED INFLUENCE | Aurizon regularly reviews both fleet  allocation and performance to optimise  service delivery.

        "page_content": "## Sustainability\n\nAurizon keeps stakeholders informed of our corporate governance and financial performance via announcements to the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) and our website. Investors can access copies of announcements to the ASX, notices of meetings, annual reports, policies, investor presentations, webcasts, and transcripts of those presentations on our website. In addition, we take a direct approach to reporting environmental, social and governance (ESG) disclosures to our stakeholders with the publication of our annual Sustainability Report.\n\nWe recognise that our climate change disclosures are one of the key interests to stakeholders. Since 2017, we have aligned our climate-related disclosures to the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) as recommended by the Financial Stability Board. This framework enables consistent climate-related financial risk disclosures for use by companies in providing information to investors, lenders, insurers, and other stakeholders. Our response to climate-related risks is outlined in our annual Sustainability Report.\n\nIn FY2021, we published our Climate Strategy and Action Plan (CSAP). The strategy builds on our existing work in reducing our carbon footprint. We recognise that we all have a responsibility to act on climate change government, business, and the general community - so we can achieve an e/ffective transition to a low-carbon future.\n\nFor more information on our approach to climate change, including risks relating to decarbonisation, refer to the Risk section of the Directors' Report in the FY2023 Annual Report and our annual Sustainability Report.\n\nIn 2022, we received a 'Comprehensive' rating, the highest rating for an eighth consecutive year by the Australian Council of Superannuation Investors (ACSI) for corporate sustainability reporting in Australia.\n\n## Safety\n\nAt Aurizon, we are committed to protecting our people and the communities in which we operate.\n\nDuring FY2023, we embedded our Safety Strategy focused on nine key priorities and delivered several key strategic projects and initiatives. In April, Aurizon launched its Enterprise Critical Control Management framework. While Aurizon's business units have traditionally managed critical risk at a local level, the new enterprise program is designed to simplify process and enable a consistent approach to our eleven Critical Safety Risks across our national operations. Also, in late FY2023, Aurizon launched its new Event Learning Framework to further facilitate the prioritisation of learning from events, enabling stronger and more resilient systems to keep our people safe.\n\nThroughout FY2023, Aurizon has continued to deliver against its Mental Health and Wellbeing Strategy, including conducting a psychosocial risk management pilot focused on understanding psychosocial risk hazards present in our operations.\n\nAs we move into FY2024, Aurizon continues to focus on embedding our strategy and focus our attention on simple systems and process, understanding and controlling risk and building leadership and the capability of our people. For example, enhancements in contractor safety and fatigue risk management.\n\nAurizon uses two primary safety metrics to measure safety performance across the enterprise: Total Recordable Injury Frequency Rate (TRIFR) and potential and actual Serious Injury and Fatality Frequency Rate (SIFR(a+p)). For FY2023, Aurizon has reported these twocore metrics excluding Bulk Central. Moving into FY2024, Aurizon enterprise and Bulk Central will be integrated into the one metric.\n\nFY2023 TRIFR (excluding Bulk Central) was 8.36 injuries per million hours worked compared to 8.51 for FY2022, an improvement in our overall TRIFR of 1.76%. FY2023 SIFR(a+p) (excluding Bulk Central) was 1.92 events per million hours worked compared to 4.41 for FY2022, representing a 56% improvement.\n\nBulk Central TRIFR for FY2023 is 10.26 compared to 4.09 in FY2022, representing a deterioration of 151%. The increase is the result of a single event in June 2023 whereby a heavy vehicle pulled into the path of an Aurizon train at a protected level crossing outside of Katherine, in the Northern Territory resulting in injuries to all four train crew. Excluding this event, Bulk Central was representing a year-on-year improvement of 11%. Bulk Central SIFR(a+p) for FY2023 is 6.41 and is the first period Bulk Central has been using this measure.\n\n## Environment\n\nAurizon recognises our responsibility to aid our local communities and supply chains by delivering environmental value through e/ffective management of environmental risks and improved enterprise environmental performance. We employ proactive and evidence-based management measures covering key environmental issues such as, climate change, resource use and clean air.\n\nFollowing the acquisition of Bulk Central, environmental licences in South Australia have been consolidated. Bulk Central has been steadily integrated into Aurizon's existing annual second line environmental assurance program which assesses compliance with legislative obligations and applicable licences. No material non-compliances were reported.",

        "page_content": "## Directors' Report (continued) OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW\n\nAurizon continues to work collaboratively with supply chain partners to minimise coal dust emissions associated with Aurizon's Coal haulage operations. Data from the CQCN opacity monitoring stations indicated FY2023 continues to yield low rates of coal dust loss from tops of wagons. For further detail in relation to coal dust management and monitoring processes, refer to Aurizon's annual Sustainability Report.\n\nAurizon successfully transitioned its three Safeguard Mechanism Facilities (covering Scope 1 GHG emissions associated with rail activities in QLD, NSW and WA) to a single National Transport Facility, with approval granted by the Clean Energy Regulator on 29 March 2023. Bulk Central's emission reporting requirements, including National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting (NGER) and National Pollutant Inventory (NPI) have been incorporated into national reporting requirements for Aurizon. Aurizon will not be required to purchase or retire Australian Carbon Credit Units (ACCUs) to meet its obligations under the Safeguard Mechanism in FY2023. This was achieved through e/ffective management of its Scope 1 emissions intensity to remain below baselines. The Safeguard Mechanism reforms passed by Federal parliament in March 2023, which commenced on 1 July 2023, mean that Aurizon is estimated to have a carbon liability for the first time in FY2024. Su/fficient ACCUs have been purchased to achieve this compliance obligation.\n\n## In FY2023:\n\n- \u203a Aurizon has not incurred any fines, penalties or prosecutions arising from environmental or cultural heritage related incidents; and\n- \u203a Aurizon has had four notifiable environmental incidents. Remedial actions were implemented as required and no ongoing material environmental impacts are anticipated.\n\n## People\n\nAt Aurizon, our people are our greatest asset. We have over 5,700 employees living and working across our national footprint of operations. Our Aurizon values (Safety, People, Integrity, Customer and Excellence) guide our people's work, in delivering bulk commodities to the world, and are underpinned by a workplace culture of connection to enable great outcomes.\n\nThrough our commitment to safe and e/fficient delivery for our customers, we are building our workforce for the future. Strong leadership, culture and values-aligned people practices lay the foundation to achieve this. During the year we progressed key initiatives, including:\n\n- \u203a providing meaningful ways for our people to develop their skills and capabilities, now and for the future. Our established Leadership programs are designed to embed a safe and high performing culture where our people live our values and are engaged and enabled to do their best work. We also recognise the need for development at all levels and rolled out new programs for emerging leaders. We also implemented a new Capability Framework to help our people identify development opportunities for current and future roles\n- \u203a ensuring our people processes and systems adapt to the needs of our leaders and people, and actively facilitates the attraction and retention of our current and future workforce. This year we have focused on renewing our workforce planning process and initiatives as well as progressing a refreshed employee value proposition\n- \u203a continuing to strive towards creating an inclusive culture by embedding flexible work practices, creating awareness and driving action for inclusion through employee representative groups (across gender, First Nations peoples and LGBTQIA+), meeting workforce representation targets and actively reducing the gender pay gap. In August 2022, we launched our first ALL in Action Plan 'Advancing LGBTQIA+ Inclusion at Aurizon' - aligning our activities to three pillars to support the Group's vision visibility, education and connection\n- \u203a integrating the Bulk Central business into Aurizon's existing processes, ensuring alignment across people and performance priorities, complementing the established cultures.",

        "page_content": "## Directors' Report (continued) REMUNERATION REPORT\n\nDear fellow shareholders\n\nOn behalf of the Board, I am pleased to present Aurizon's Financial Year (FY) 2023 Remuneration Report.\n\nAurizon delivered Underlying Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortisation (EBITDA) in FY2023 of $1,428 million. This was 3% lower than the prior year, due to prolonged wet weather, mine production issues and some labour shortages. Despite the challenging operating environment, Aurizon has continued to deliver a strong operating discipline and safety performance which is a credit to the ongoing e/fforts and dedication of our employees. We have a resilient business, with a strong balance sheet and important revenue protection mechanisms which help support our earnings in the current elevated inflationary environment.\n\nDuring the year, the Company has delivered a number of key strategic initiatives, including completing the acquisition and integration of the One Rail Australia business (and subsequent divestment of East Coast Rail) and the establishment of a national Containerised Freight business. These are important building blocks for the future growth of Aurizon, where we diversify the products we transport for customers and tap into growing and emerging markets.\n\nThe Coal business recorded lower Underlying EBITDA of $455 million, down 16% from the prior year primarily due to a decrease in volumes, Take-or-Pay expenses and higher costs, partially o/ffset by higher CPI benefits in haulage contracts.\n\nThe Network business achieved 1% higher Underlying EBITDA of $813 million. Volume uplift (1%) was limited due to the impact of prolonged wet weather o/ffset by the recognition of Take-or-Pay revenue.\n\nThe Bulk business recorded a 59% increase in Underlying EBITDA of $214 million, due to the acquisition of One Rail Australia, higher iron ore and grain volumes and growth with new contracts.\n\nThe Short Term Incentive (STI) Award for FY2023 continued to be based on the three annual performance measures of Underlying EBITDA, Safety and Individual Key Deliverables. Business Unit earnings metrics continue to be used for Bulk, Coal and Network.\n\nGroup Underlying EBITDA fell below Threshold in the scorecard. Coal and Bulk Underlying EBITDA also resulted in a below Threshold outcome, with Network Underlying EBITDA achieving an above Target result.\n\nDuring FY2023, several key strategic initiatives in our Safety Strategy were delivered, including our Enterprise Critical Control Management framework. While Aurizon's business units have traditionally managed critical risk at a local level, this program is designed to simplify process and enable a consistent approach to Critical Safety Risks across our national operations.\n\nIn FY2023, Aurizon utilised two primary safety metrics in the remuneration framework: Total Recordable Injury Frequency Rate (TRIFR) and Serious Injury and Fatality Frequency Rate, including both actual and potential events (SIFR(a+p)). We have seen significant improvement in SIFR(a+p), resulting in a Stretch outcome. Although there was modest, but continued year-on-year improvement in TRIFR, the result was below Threshold.\n\nAs we move into FY2024, Aurizon continues to embed our Safety Strategy, focusing our attention on simple systems and processes, understanding and controlling risk, and building leadership and the capability of our people such as enhancements in contractor safety and fatigue risk management.\n\nThe STI Award also considers performance against individual objectives which vary for Key Management Personnel (KMP). Management has made strong progress across the strategic levers (Optimise, Excel and Extend) including commencement of the project to build a zero-emissions capable freight locomotive, powered by batteries and other Climate Strategy and Action Plan (CSAP) initiatives. Consistent with prior years, delivery against Aurizon's CSAP will continue to form part of the MD & CEO and Executive individual deliverables in FY2024 and is cascaded broadly.\n\nThe varied performance across the STI measures is reflected directly in the STI payments for our Executive KMP. The Board has determined that overall outcomes between Threshold and Target will be awarded for Executive KMP.\n\nDuring FY2023, the 2019 Long Term Incentive (LTI) Award was subject to testing. It included relative Total Shareholder Return (TSR) and Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) measures. No portion of the relative TSR component vested and these rights will lapse. ROIC achieved an outcome between the minimum and maximum vesting point, with 35% of the total award to vest.\n\nThe Board considers that these overall remuneration outcomes reach an appropriate balance between business performance, shareholder outcomes and recognising the contribution of the Leadership Team.\n\nDuring FY2023, the Board continued to review and refine Aurizon's Remuneration Framework. For FY2024 the STI scorecard will not include a Network business unit EBITDA measure, reverting to the Group EBITDA financial measure to better align Network with enterprise performance outcomes. Additionally, an operational measure will be included in the Network individual deliverables focused on improving network velocity and disciplined train operations. For the 2023 LTI Award, there has been an increase in the non-coal growth target in line with the upgraded aspirations for the Bulk and Containerised Freight business units.\n\nFurther changes may be implemented from FY2024 to ensure the framework continues to deliver against our remuneration principles and long-term strategic outlook, and to ensure it remains e/ffective in driving strong performance.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTim Poole\n\nChairman",

Remuneration  Framework Components\n\n## Total Potential Remuneration\n\nAurizon's Remuneration Framework for each Executive comprises three components:\n\n- \u203a Fixed remuneration (not 'at risk') that comprises salary and other benefits, including superannuation\n- \u203a Short Term Incentive Award (STIA) ('at risk' component, awarded on the achievement of performance conditions over a 12-month period) that comprises both a cash component and a component deferred for 12 months into equity which is subject to claw-back for financial misstatements and misconduct\n- \u203a Long Term Incentive Award (LTIA) ('at risk' component, awarded on the achievement of performance conditions over a fouryear period) that comprises only an equity component.\n\nThe structure is intended to provide an appropriate mix of fixed and variable remuneration, and provide a combination of incentives intended to drive performance against the Company's short and longer-term business objectives.\n\nThe mix of potential remuneration components for FY2023 for the MD & CEO and Executive KMP is set out in Figure 1: Total potential remuneration. The remuneration mix for MD & CEO and remaining Executive KMP remains unchanged.\n\n## Executive Remuneration Governance\n\nFigure 2 represents Aurizon's remuneration governance framework. Details on the composition of the Remuneration and People Committee (Committee) are set out on page 9 of this report. The Committee's Charter is available in the Governance section of the Company's website at www.aurizon.com.au.\n\n## FIGURE 1 - TOTAL POTENTIAL REMUNERATION 1\n\nFIGURE 2 - REMUNERATION GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 1 Assumes achievement of the stretch performance hurdle outcomes for STIA, full vesting of the Deferred STIA and LTIA at a value equal to the maximum opportunity of the original award i.e. assuming no share price appreciation.\n\n## BOARD\n\n## The Board:\n\n- \u203a approves the overall remuneration policy and ensures it is competitive, fair and aligned with the long-term interests of the Company\n- \u203a approves the remuneration for Non-Executive Directors, MD & CEO, Executive KMP and the remaining Group Executives\n- \u203a assesses the performance of, and determines the STIA outcome for, the MD & CEO giving due weight to objective performance measures while retaining discretion to determine final outcomes\n- 20 40 60 80 100 \u203a considers and determines the STIA outcomes of the Executive KMP and remaining Group Executives based on the recommendations of the MD & CEO.\n\n0\n\n20\n\n## REMUNERATION AND PEOPLE COMMITTEE\n\nThe Remuneration and People Committee is delegated responsibility by the Board to review and make recommendations on:\n\n- \u203a the remuneration policies and framework for the Company\n- \u203a Non-Executive Director remuneration\n- \u203a remuneration for MD & CEO, Executive KMP and the remaining Group Executives\n- \u203a Executive incentive arrangements.\n\n## MANAGEMENT\n\n- \u203a Provides information relevant to remuneration decisions and makes recommendations to the Remuneration and People Committee\n- \u203a Obtains remuneration information from external advisors to assist the Remuneration and People Committee (i.e. market data, legal advice, accounting advice, tax advice).\n\nCONSULTATION WITH SHAREHOLDERS AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS\n\n## REMUNERATION CONSULTANTS AND OTHER EXTERNAL ADVISORS\n\n40 60 80 100 In performing duties and making recommendations to the Board, the Remuneration and People Committee may from time to time appoint and engage independent advisors directly in relation to Executive remuneration matters.\n\nThese advisors:\n\n- \u203a review and provide recommendations on the appropriateness of the MD & CEO and Executive remuneration\n- \u203a provide independent advice, information and recommendations relevant to remuneration decisions.\n\nAny recommendations and advice provided by external advisors are used to assist the Board - they do not substitute for the Board and Remuneration and People Committee processes.\n\n0",

Company Performance for Financial Year 2023\n\nAurizon reported Group Underlying EBITDA of $1,428 million for continuing operations for year ended 30 June 2023 in line with the revised EBITDA guidance range ($1,420m - $1,470m).\n\nThe past 12 months have been challenging due to prolonged wet weather, mine production issues and some labour shortages. This has resulted in Group EBITDA at the lower end of guidance.\n\nTable 4 shows historical Company performance across a range of key measures. Performance across earnings and individual measures is reflected directly in STIA payments. Detail related to performance against the FY2023 STIA performance measures is provided in Table 6 (page 38).

ROIC achieved an outcome between the minimum and maximum vesting point and therefore 35% of this Award will vest in October 2023.\n\nMovement in the Aurizon share price over the various performance periods is reflected in the remuneration outcomes for Executive KMP, aligning Executive KMP outcomes with the shareholder experience.\n\nTABLE 5 - REMUNERATION EARNED IN FINANCIAL YEAR 2023\n\n| NAME                 | FIXED  REMUNERATION   $'000   | NON-MONETARY  BENEFITS 1   $'000   | STIA   CASH 2 $'000   | STIA DEFERRED   FROM PRIOR YEAR 3 $'000   | LTIA  VESTING 4 $'000   | SHARE PRICE  DEPRECIATION 5 $'000   | ACTUAL FY2023  REMUNERATION OUTCOMES  $'000   |\n|----------------------|-------------------------------|------------------------------------|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|\n| EXECUTIVE KMP        | EXECUTIVE KMP                 |                                    |                       |                                           |                         |                                     |                                               |\n| A Harding            | 1,800                         | -                                  | 570                   | 835                                       | 721                     | (178)                               | 3,748                                         |\n| P Bains              | 824                           | -                                  | 363                   | 298                                       | 310                     | (81)                                | 1,714                                         |\n| A Dartnell 6         | 110                           | -                                  | 22                    | -                                         | 83                      | (28)                                | 187                                           |\n| G Lippiatt           | 800                           | -                                  | 182                   | 265                                       | 101                     | (13)                                | 1,335                                         |\n| E McKeiver           | 731                           | -                                  | 149                   | 246                                       | 269                     | (71)                                | 1,324                                         |\n| FORMER EXECUTIVE KMP | FORMER EXECUTIVE KMP          |                                    |                       |                                           |                         |                                     |                                               |\n| C McDonald 7         | 731                           | -                                  | -                     | -                                         | -                       | -                                   | 731                                           |\n\n- 1 Non-monetary benefits represent the value of Reportable Fringe Benefits for the respective FBT year ending 31 March.\n- 2  The amount relates to the cash component (60%) of the FY2023 STIA which will be paid in September 2023.\n- 3   The amount relates to the deferred component (40%) of the FY2022 STIA which was awarded in performance rights and will become unrestricted in September 2023 (calculation assumes a share price of $3.63 at date of issue).\n- 4   The amount relates to the portion of the 2019 Award which was subject to testing in FY2023 but will vest in October 2023 (calculation based on share price of $5.93 at date of issue).\n- 5   The amount is the number of rights which vest multiplied by the increase or decrease in the Aurizon share price over the period ended 30 June 2023 (calculation assumes share price appreciation of $0.29 DSTIA and a share price depreciation of $2.01 LTIA).\n- 6  The amount relates to the Fixed Remuneration and STIA attributable to the Group Executive Bulk role (commenced as KMP on 2 May 2023).\n- 7  C McDonald rights awarded under 2019 LTIA, 2022 DSTIA and FY2023 STIA lapsed upon cessation on 14 July 2023.",

        "page_content": "## 6. Short Term Incentive Award\n\n## What is the STIA and who participates?\n\nThe STIA is 'at risk' remuneration subject to the achievement of pre-defined Company, Business Unit and individual performance measures which are set annually by the Board at the beginning of the performance period.\n\nFor each component of the STIA, three performance levels are set:\n\n- \u203a Threshold, below which no STIA is paid for that component\n- \u203a Target, which typically aligns to relevant corporate plans and budgets, a business improvement targeted outcome or reflects an improvement on historical achievement\n- \u203a Stretch, outcomes which are materially better than Target.\n\nThe STIA applies in a similar manner to other eligible employees. For the MD & CEO, Executive KMP and the remaining Group Executives a portion (40%) will be deferred into equity for a period of 12 months, which is subject to claw-back for financial misstatements or misconduct.\n\n## What are the Company performance measures?\n\nThe performance measures which apply to all participants are Underlying EBITDA, Safety and individual performance.\n\nBusiness Unit measures are included in the scorecard for Bulk, Coal and Network.\n\nEach measure has a defined level of performance. The measures drive a continuous safety improvement culture, strengthen and grow our current business while continuing to transform the Enterprise.\n\nThis is achieved through a focus on people and asset e/fficiencies while at the same time, delivering benefits to shareholders.\n\nIndividual performance measures relate to each specific role and measure an individual's contribution against a range of operational and strategic performance measures. At the start of the performance year the Board determines the MD & CEO's individual deliverables. Relevant deliverables are cascaded to the Executive Committee and throughout the organisation as reflected in Figure 4.\n\n## What is the amount that participants can earn through an STIA?\n\nThe employment agreements specify a target STIA, expressed as a percentage of Fixed Remuneration (100% for the MD & CEO and 75% for the remaining Executive KMP). Each participant can earn between 0% up to a maximum of 150% of this target percentage, depending on performance and subject to Board discretion. Depending on performance assessed at year end, participants may earn for each enterprise measure: 0% for performance below Threshold, 50% at Threshold (for measures other than Underlying EBITDA, for which Threshold earnings are 30%) with a linear scale up to 100% at Target performance; and a further linear scale to 200% at Stretch performance.\n\nSTIA outcomes are determined by calculating the performance outcome against the relevant weighted performance measure. Figure 5 provides an example of an at-target performance outcome based on the FY2023 scorecard.\n\n## FIGURE 4 - STRATEGIC MEASURES CASCADING PROCESS\n\nFIGURE 5 - STIA TARGET PERFORMANCE OUTCOME CALCULATION\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## What are the outcomes for FY2023?\n\nTable 6 identifies the performance measures, relevant weightings, and outcomes for FY2023. Group Underlying EBITDA performance resulted in a Below Threshold outcome, reflecting a challenging year due to prolonged wet weather, mine production issues and labour shortages.\n\nBusiness Unit Underlying EBITDA performance resulted in a Below Threshold outcome for Coal and Bulk, and an outcome between Target and Stretch for Network.\n\nIn FY2023 the safety metric Serious Injury and Fatality Frequency Rate, including both actual and potential events (SIFR(a+p)) replaced Rail Process Safety (RPS). The new metric will ensure safety remains core to the business with increased focus on high severity events that have the potential to seriously injure our people.\n\nFY2023 performance resulted in a TRIFR Below Threshold and SIFR(a+p) at Stretch.\n\nThe STIA also considers performance against individual deliverables which vary for Executives and are aligned to strategic enterprise objectives.\n\nDuring FY2023, individual deliverables continued to focus on strategic levers (Optimise, Excel and Extend). Some of the initiatives successfully delivered include the deployment of TrainGuard, implementation of critical control management, the One Rail Australia acquisition and integration, and successful divestment of East Coast Rail and establishment of a national Containerised Freight business.\n\nThe FY2023 actual outcomes for Executive KMP are identified within Table 7.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Long Term Incentive Award\n\n## What is the LTIA and who participates?\n\nThe LTIA is the component of Total Potential Remuneration linked to providing long-term incentives for selected Executives whom the Board has identified as being able to contribute directly to the generation of long-term shareholder returns. This includes the MD & CEO, Executive KMP, the remaining Group Executives and a number of other management employees.\n\n## What is the amount that Executives can earn through an LTIA?\n\nThe maximum potential remuneration (expressed as a percentage of Fixed Remuneration) available through the LTIA is 150% in the case of the MD & CEO and 112.5% for the remaining Executive KMP.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## What is the performance period?\n\nThe company hurdles for the LTIA are measured over a four-year period. Retesting does not form part of any award.\n\n## What are the performance hurdles?\n\nThe 2019 Award and the 2020 Award have two performance hurdles: Relative Total Shareholder Return and Average Return on Invested Capital. From the 2021 Award a Strategic Transformation measure was introduced to reflect the growing aspirations of the Bulk business and other non-Coal investments as outlined in Table 9.\n\n## How is the LTIA determined?\n\nThe number of performance rights issued under the LTIA to each Executive is calculated by dividing their respective LTIA potential remuneration (expressed as a percentage of Fixed Remuneration) by the five-day Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP) of Aurizon shares at the time of their award.\n\nEach performance right is a right to receive one share in Aurizon upon vesting. The number of performance rights that vest is determined by performance outcomes compared against predetermined company hurdles as described in Table 8 and Table 9.\n\n## What happens when performance rights vest?\n\nPerformance rights awarded under the LTIA vest subject to the satisfaction of company hurdles. Rights vest and the resulting shares are transferred to the Executive at no cost to the Executive. Value of the award will be subject to movements in the Aurizon share price over the performance period, aligning Executive outcomes and shareholder experience.\n\nCompany performance and vesting outcomes for the 2019 LTIA is identified in Table 8. Partial vesting of the LTIA has occurred which is aligned with the shareholder experience over the performance period.\n\nTABLE 8 - COMPANY PERFORMANCE AGAINST LONG TERM INCENTIVE AWARDS SUBJECT TO TESTING IN FINANCIAL YEAR 2023 1\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| COMPANY HURDLE AND PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT PERIOD      | COMPANY HURDLE AND PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT PERIOD                                                          | WEIGHTING   | RESULT                 | %   VESTED   | %  LAPSED   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|------------------------|--------------|-------------|\n| 2019 AWARD: 01 JULY 2019 - 30 JUNE 2023                | 2019 AWARD: 01 JULY 2019 - 30 JUNE 2023                                                                    |             |                        |              |             |\n| Relative TSR:  against peer  group within ASX100 Index | 30% of rights vest at the 50th percentile, 75% at the  62.5th percentile up to 100% at the 75th percentile | 50%         | Below 50th  Percentile | 0%           | 100%        |\n| ROIC:  average annual ROIC  FY2020 - FY2023            | 50% of rights vest with an average ROIC of 9.5%,   up to 100% at 10.5%                                     | 50%         | 9.9%                   | 70%          | 30%         |\n\n1   Vesting will occur in October 2023.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMaximum/emspace\n\nBetween Minimum and Maximum/emspace\n\nMinimum/emspace\n\nBelow Minimum",

The 2022 Award baseline reflects combined Underlying EBITDA for Bulk and One Rail Australia (excluding East Coast Rail)\n- \u203a From the 2023 Award, determined by reference to Non-Coal Underlying EBITDA growth over the performance period.

Retention awards may be time-based or project-based and are governed by stringent performance conditions and may be cash-based or equity-based. During FY2023, no retention awards were issued to Executive KMP and 176,425 performance rights were issued across a number of other employees.

Executive Employment Agreements\n\n## Executive Employment Agreements\n\nRemuneration and other terms of employment for the MD & CEO and Executive KMP are formalised in an Employment Agreement as summarised in Table 10.\n\n## Minimum shareholding and retention policy\n\nTo align KMP and Group Executives with shareholders, the Company requires:\n\n- \u203a Non-Executive Directors to accumulate and maintain one year's Total Directors' fees (consisting of Directors' fee plus applicable Committee fee/s) of shares in the Company\n- \u203a the MD & CEO to accumulate and maintain one year's Fixed Remuneration of shares in the Company\n- \u203a the remaining Executive KMP and Group Executives to accumulate and maintain 50% of one year's Fixed Remuneration of shares in the Company.\n\nThis is to be achieved within six years of the date of their appointment. This will be calculated with reference to the Total Directors' fees and Executives' Fixed Remuneration during the period divided by the number of years.\n\nDetails of KMP shareholdings as at 30 June 2023 are set out in Table 11.\n\n## Hedging and margin lending policies\n\nAurizon has in place a policy that prohibits Executives from hedging economic exposure to unvested rights that have been issued pursuant to a Company employee share plan. The policy also prohibits margin loan arrangements for the purpose of purchasing Aurizon shares. Adherence to this policy is monitored regularly and involves each Executive signing an annual declaration of compliance with the policy.\n\n## TABLE 10 - EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS\n\nTABLE 11 - KMP SHAREHOLDINGS AS AT 30 JUNE 2023\n\n| NAME          | DURATION OF   EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT   | FIXED REMUNERATION   AT END OF FINANCIAL   YEAR 2023 1   | BY EXECUTIVE   | NOTICE PERIOD 2 BY COMPANY 3   |\n|---------------|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|----------------|--------------------------------|\n| EXECUTIVE KMP |                                      |                                                          |                |                                |\n| A Harding     | Ongoing                              | 1,800,000                                                | 6 months       | 12 months                      |\n| P Bains       | Ongoing                              | 824,000                                                  | 3 months       | 6 months                       |\n| A Dartnell    | Ongoing                              | 670,000                                                  | 3 months       | 6 months                       |\n| G Lippiatt    | Ongoing                              | 800,000                                                  | 3 months       | 6 months                       |\n| E McKeiver    | Ongoing                              | 731,300                                                  | 3 months       | 6 months                       |\n\n- 1   Fixed remuneration includes a superannuation component.\n- 2  Post employment restraints in any competitor business in Australia are aligned to the notice period.\n- 3  Any termination payment will be subject to compliance with the Corporations Act 2001 and will not exceed 12 months (unless approved by shareholders).\n\n| NAME                    | BALANCE   AT THE START   OF THE YEAR   | RECEIVED   DURING THE YEAR   ON VESTING   | OTHER   CHANGES DURING   THE YEAR   | BALANCE   AT THE END   OF THE YEAR   | % OF FIXED  REMUNERATION 1   |\n|-------------------------|----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|------------------------------|\n| NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS |                                        |                                           |                                     |                                      |                              |\n| T Poole 2               | 180,500                                | -

Negative amounts represent the utilisation of annual leave.\n- 4    Non-monetary benefits represent the value of Reportable Fringe Benefits for the respective FBT year ending 31 March.\n- 5    Superannuation amounts represent employers' contribution to superannuation.\n- 6    The accounting expense recognised in relation to rights granted in the year is the fair value independently calculated at grant date using an expected outcome model. This was consistent with the Monte-Carlo simulation conducted in the prior year and resulted in similar outcomes. This amount is progressively expensed over the vesting period. Refer to note 27 for further details regarding the fair value of Rights. These values may not represent the future value that the Executive will receive, as the vesting of the Rights is subject to the achievement of performance conditions. This includes the cost of deferred short-term incentives and long-term incentives.\n- 7    The short-term incentives (cash bonus), deferred short-term incentives and long-term incentives (equity settled share-based payments) represent the at-risk performance related remuneration.\n- 8    A Dartnell was appointed Group Executive Bulk on 2 May 2023. The cash salary and fees (column A) and cash bonus (column B) reflect the salary and STIA attributable to the Group Executive Bulk role.\n- 9   No remuneration was received associated with the FY2023 STIA.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Information is considered material and relevant due to its size and nature or if the information:\n\n- \u203a is important for understanding the Group's current period results;\n- \u203a provides an explanation of significant changes in the Group's business - for example acquisitions or divestments; or\n- \u203a relates to an aspect of the Group's operations that are important to its future performance.\n\n## Key events and transactions for the reporting period\n\n## (a)  Acquisition of subsidiaries and interests in joint ventures One Rail Australia\n\nThe Group signed a Partnership Interest Sale Agreement with Macquarie Asset Management (on behalf of its managed funds and clients) on 21 October 2021 to acquire 100% of the general and limited partnership interests in Aurizon Bulk Central Holdings LP (formerly One Rail Australia Holdings LP). Aurizon Bulk Central Holdings LP and its subsidiaries are collectively referred to as 'One Rail Australia'. The acquisition completed on 29 July 2022 for consideration of $2,404 million.\n\nOne Rail Australia comprised two main business segments:\n\n- \u203a One Rail Bulk: Integrated bulk rail haulage and general freight assets in South Australia and the Northern Territory and below rail operator and economic owner of 2,460km of rail infrastructure including the 2,245km Tarcoola-to-Darwin railway line; and\n- \u203a East Coast Rail: Coal haulage in New South Wales and Queensland.\n\nOne Rail Bulk has been integrated into the Group's Bulk segment and renamed Aurizon Bulk Central. Aurizon Bulk Central is the only rail freight operator along the South Australia/Northern Territory corridor and products hauled include copper, grain, iron ore, gypsum and containerised freight. Aurizon Bulk Central also manages the Tarcoola-to-Darwin rail infrastructure, and the intrastate rail freight network in South Australia. Provision of access to the below rail infrastructure is regulated by the Essential Services Commission of South Australia (ESCOSA).\n\nThe investments held in the East Coast Rail entities were transferred to One Rail Australia Holdings Limited (ORAH) (formerly NHK Pty Ltd), a subsidiary of the Company, on 29 July 2022. During the year, the Group completed the divestment of ORAH in accordance with the Company's Undertaking to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) as part of its acquisition of One Rail Australia. Refer to section (b) for further information on the divestment of ORAH.\n\nThe acquisition of One Rail Australia was funded from cash, existing bank debt facilities and new bank debt facilities. Refer to note 18(b)(i) for further information on the Group's financing arrangements.\n\nAcquisition costs of $49 million (2022: $14 million) including landholder duty, advisory fees and other costs have been expensed to profit or loss during the year and classified in other expenses. This amount has been classified as a significant item in continuing operations.\n\nRefer to note 22 for further information on the One Rail Australia acquisition.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Ox Mountain Limited is a maintenance software developer and distributor focusing on asset intensive sectors such as mining and rail operations/infrastructure and has customers and operations in Australia and globally. The investment continues to be classified as a joint venture due to the Group having joint control and is accounted for using the equity method of accounting.\n\n## (b) Disposals\n\n## One Rail Australia Holdings Limited (ORAH)\n\nThe Group completed the sale of ORAH to Magnetic Rail Group Pty Ltd (Magnetic) on 17 February 2023 for consideration of $438 million including completion adjustments. The total consideration includes $313 million cash proceeds received on completion of the sale and $125 million cash proceeds receivable in February 2024. On completion of the sale, Magnetic assumed ORAH's existing borrowings of $474 million.\n\nThe loss from discontinued operations after tax of $48 million for the year includes operating net profit after tax for the period 30 July 2022 to 17 February 2023 of $34 million excluding significant items.\n\nRefer to note 23 for further information on the discontinued operation.\n\n## (c) Debt  financing\n\n## Aurizon Operations Limited (via a wholly owned subsidiary Aurizon Finance Pty Ltd)\n\nTo fund the acquisition of One Rail Australia in July 2022, the Group added $1,450 million of capacity to existing unsecured bank debt facilities. The additional capacity included a $650 million bridge facility maturing July 2024, a $400 million revolving facility maturing July 2025, and a $400 million term loan facility maturing July 2027. The $650 million bridge facility has been partly repaid during FY2023, with the facility limit reduced to $350 million at reporting date.\n\nThe Group successfully priced a US Private Placement (USPP) comprising of both USD and AUD tranches (~A$503 million equivalent) in June 2023 which settled subsequent to the reporting date on 26 July 2023 (Finance USPP). The proceeds from the Finance USPP have been used to repay the remainder of the $350 million bridge facility drawn to fund the acquisition of One Rail Australia. The Finance USPP includes a A$50 million tranche maturing July 2033, a A$50 million tranche maturing July 2034, a US$133 million tranche maturing July 2030, a US$70 million tranche maturing July 2033 and a US$70 million tranche maturing July 2035. Cross-currency interest rate swaps covering the entirety of the US$273 million issued have been executed to swap USD tranches to AUD floating rate debt.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn June 2023, the Group also re-financed existing floating rate bilateral facilities and reduced the capacity from $625 million to $605 million (the capacity at reporting date was $555 million, with $50 million capacity added on 3 July 2023). The re-financed bilateral facilities include $465 million ($415 million at reporting date) maturing July 2026, $65 million maturing November 2023, and $75 million maturing November 2025. The maturity of the $125 million working capital facility was also extended to June 2024.\n\nFloating-to-fixed rate interest rate swaps with a notional amount of $1,550 million have been executed with a range of maturities from three to 10 years. As at 30 June 2023, variable rate borrowings are 98% hedged through fixed rate interest rate swaps for an average period of 4.6 years.\n\n## Aurizon Network Pty Ltd (Network)\n\nThe Group privately placed two AUD fixed rate Medium-Term Notes (AMTNs) in December 2022, including a $50 million AMTN maturing December 2032 (Network AMTN 6) and a $20 million AMTN maturing December 2034 (Network AMTN 7). The capacity of Network AMTN 6 was increased by $30 million to $80 million in February 2023. Interest rate swaps with a notional amount of $100 million have been executed to swap the fixed rate AMTNs to floating rate debt.\n\nIn January 2023, the Group re-financed existing floating rate bilateral facilities and reduced the capacity from $1,200 million to $1,090 million. The re-financed bilateral facilities include $575 million maturing January 2026, $310 million maturing January 2027, and $205 million maturing January 2028. The maturity of the $75 million working capital facility was extended to June 2024.\n\nThe Group successfully priced a USPP comprising of both USD and AUD tranches (~A$306 million equivalent) in April 2023, which settled in June 2023 (Network USPP). The proceeds from the Network USPP, along with Network AMTN 6 and Network AMTN 7, will be used to repay Network AMTN 2 maturing June 2024. In the interim period, the proceeds have been used to repay drawn bank debt facilities. The Network USPP includes a A$55.5 million tranche maturing June 2033, a A$55.5 million tranche maturing June 2035, a US$87 million tranche maturing June 2033, and a US$45 million tranche maturing June 2035. Cross-currency interest rate swaps covering the entirety of the US$132 million have been executed to swap USD tranches to AUD floating rate debt.\n\nFloating-to-fixed interest rate swaps with a notional amount of $2,300 million matured June 2023, in line with the WACC reset date in the 2017 Access Undertaking (UT5). The floating-to-fixed interest rate swaps were replaced with a notional amount of $2,900 million (including $570 million future dated swaps) maturing June 2027 to align with the remaining term of UT5. As at 30 June 2023, variable rate borrowings are 88% hedged through fixed rate interest rate swaps for an average period of 4.0 years.",

Network submitted an amended FY2022 Revenue Adjustment Amount of $36 million (net under-recovery) ($25 million excluding GAPE) on 20 January 2023 in compliance with the QCA's decision, so as to ensure the other aspects of the QCA's decision could operate without delays arising, and reserved its rights in relation to the proper interpretation of the Report Date. On the same day, Network lodged an application with the Supreme Court of Queensland to appeal the QCA's decision, seeking a declaration from the court about the proper interpretation of the definition of Report Date. The Supreme Court hearing took place on 14 June 2023. On 28 July 2023, the Supreme Court dismissed Network's application and decided that the Report Date is 14 March 2022. Network is considering the judgement and next steps. At this time, there is no requirement for any further adjustment to FY2024 tari/ffs.\n\nThe QCA's decision has no impact on FY2023 access revenue as the FY2022 Revenue Adjustment Amount will be reflected in reference tari/ffs for FY2024.\n\nIn FY2023 annual volumes were lower than the regulatory forecast resulting in Take-or-Pay of $100.2 million ($76.1 million excluding GAPE) being recognised. In addition, there was a net under-recovery amount of approximately $31.5 million ($27.2 million excluding GAPE) which represents the FY2023 Revenue Adjustment Amount that will be recovered in FY2025. The FY2023 Revenue Adjustment Amount is subject to approval by the QCA.\n\nUT5 includes a defined process to reset the WACC at 1 July 2023 (Preliminary Reset Values) and 1 July 2024 (Final Reset Values). On 25 May 2023, the QCA approved Preliminary Reset Values, including a WACC of 8.18% (applying a risk-free rate of 3.47% and a debt risk premium of 2.60%), to be incorporated into reference tari/ffs for FY2024.\n\nOn 31 July 2023, Network submitted to the QCA the Final Reset Values including a WACC of 8.51% (applying a risk-free rate of 3.87% and a debt risk premium of 2.48%). Network is providing additional information to the QCA in support of its submission prior to it being published. Following a QCA consultation and decision process on the Final Reset Values, the WACC will be incorporated into reference tari/ffs for FY2025. Any di/fference between the Preliminary and Final Reset allowable revenues for FY2024 will be reconciled through the FY2024 Revenue Adjustment Amount and reflected in reference tari/ffs for FY2026.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Revenue is recognised on an as-invoice basis because the right for consideration corresponds directly with the Group's performance obligations completed to date, except for contracts with a timing di/fference for which a contract asset or contract liability has been recognised.\n\nAs at 30 June 2023, future contracted revenues for contracts with a timing di/fference are approximately $1,799 million (2022: $2,014 million), of which $550 million is expected to be recognised in FY2024. These amounts relate to track access, freight transport and other services from contracts with customers. Future contracted revenues are in FY2023 dollars. Variable revenue is not included. As such, the future contracted revenues described above represent only part of the Group's forecast revenues for FY2024 and beyond.\n\nThe Group applies the practical expedient in AASB 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (AASB 15), paragraph 121 to all other contracts and does not disclose information on future contracted revenues. This is because the right to consideration from a customer corresponds directly with the Group's performance obligations completed to date.\n\n## SIGNIFICANT JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATES\n\n## Take-or-Pay revenue\n\nNetwork is able to recover in the financial year part of an Allowable Revenue shortfall through Take-or-Pay clauses which may trigger when annual volumes railed are less than the regulatory forecast. Take-or-Pay is calculated based on cancellations which are determined to be either of below rail cause, above rail operator cause and/or mine cause. This determination impacts the calculation of Take-or-Pay and the receivable recognised in the year that the contractual railings were not achieved as a result of rail operator and/or mine cancellations. At the reporting date, the Group recognised Take-or-Pay revenue of $59 million (2022: $28 million), after an adjustment for Take-or-Pay eliminated on consolidation. Take-or-Pay will be collected in the first half of FY2024.\n\n## (c)  Accounting policies\n\nThe Group recognises revenue as performance obligations are satisfied. Revenue includes the provision of track access and freight transport services as described below.\n\n## (i) Track access\n\nTrack access revenue is generated from the provision of access to, and operation of, the CQCN under an approved Access Undertaking. Track access revenue is recognised over time as access to the rail network is provided and is measured on a number of operating parameters including volumes hauled applied to regulator approved tari/ffs. The tari/ffs charged are determined with reference to the total allowable revenue, applied to the regulatory approved annual volume forecast for each rail system. At each reporting date, track access revenue includes an amount of revenue for which performance obligations have been met under the respective contract, but have not yet settled. These amounts are recognised as trade receivables.\n\nWhere annual volumes railed are less than the regulatory forecast, Take-or-Pay may trigger. Take-or-Pay is recognised as revenue and a receivable in the year that the contractual railings were not achieved, as the related performance obligations have been satisfied.\n\nRegulated access revenue is subject to a revenue cap mechanism that serves to ensure the rail network recovers its Allowable Revenue over the regulatory period. A revenue adjustment event results in the under or over recovery of regulatory access revenue (net of Take-or-Pay revenue) for a financial year being recognised in the accounting revenues of the second financial year following the financial year in which the event occurred as per the Access Undertaking.\n\nAccess revenue for the financial year has been recognised based on the 2017 Access Undertaking applying a WACC rate of 6.30% (2022: 6.30%). Refer to key events and transactions for further information.\n\nTrack access revenue is also generated from the provision of access to, and operation of, the rail infrastructure in South Australia and the Northern Territory. Track access revenue is recognised over time as access to the rail network is provided. Track access revenue recognised for services provided between related parties within the Group, as a result of the integrated bulk rail haulage and general freight assets in South Australia and the Northern Territory, are eliminated.\n\n## (ii)  Freight transport\n\nFreight transport revenue is recognised as the relevant performance obligations are satisfied over time, being the provision of freight transport services.\n\n<!-- image -->",

At each reporting date, freight transport revenue includes an amount of revenue for which performance obligations have been met under the respective contract, but have not yet settled. These amounts are recognised as trade receivables.\n\nA contract modification is a separate contract if the scope of services is increased by distinct additional services and the total price increases by the market rate for those services over the remaining contract period. Where the distinct services don't indicate market prices, weighted-average contract rates are applied, which may result in the recognition of a contract asset or a contract liability that amortise over the term of the individual contract. Modifications to existing agreements where there is also a new agreement put in place are assessed based on the facts and substance of the individual contractual arrangements, and are accounted for as either combined or separate contracts.\n\nA contract asset is recorded for revenue when the Group does not have an unconditional right to invoice the customer for performance obligations satisfied. A contract liability is recorded for revenue received in advance of satisfying a performance obligation and is recognised over the term of the contract.\n\n## (iii)   Capitalisation of customer contract costs\n\nWhere incremental costs are incurred to secure a new contract or an extension to an existing customer contract, these costs are capitalised as a contract asset and amortised against revenue as the performance obligations are satisfied over time.\n\n## 3  Expenses\n\nProfit before income tax from continuing operations includes the following specific expenses:\n\n|                                                   | 2023  $m   | 2022  $m   |\n|---------------------------------------------------|------------|------------|\n| Employee benefits expense                         |            |            |\n| Salaries, wages and allowances including on-costs | 888        | 767        |\n| Defined contribution superannuation expense       | 84         | 74         |\n| Redundancies                                      | 5          | 12         |\n|                                                   | 977        | 853        |\n| Depreciation and amortisation                     |            |            |\n| Depreciation of property, plant and equipment     | 637        | 563        |\n| Amortisation of intangibles                       | 29         | 29         |\n|                                                   | 666        | 592        |\n| Finance expenses                                  |            |            |\n| Interest and finance charges paid/payable         | 218        | 127        |\n| Discounting of land rehabilitation provision      | 1          | 1          |\n| Interest paid on lease liability                  | 6          | 5          |\n| Amortisation of capitalised borrowing costs       | 6          | 4          |\n| Amortisation of AMTN 2 fair value adjustment      | (2)        | (2)        |\n| Hedge ine/ffectiveness 1                          | 8          | (6)        |\n|                                                   | 237        | 129        |\n| Capitalised interest paid on qualifying assets    | (4)        | (2)        |\n|                                                   | 233        | 127        |\n\n- 1 Refer to the accounting policy in note 18.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 4  Income tax\n\nIncome tax comprises current and deferred tax recognised in profit or loss or directly in equity or other comprehensive income.\n\n## (a)  Income tax expense\n\n|                                                                        | 2023  $m   | 2022  $m   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|------------|\n| Current tax                                                            | 47         | 180        |\n| Deferred tax                                                           | 102        | 43         |\n| Current tax relating to prior periods                                  | (8)        | (16)       |\n| Deferred tax relating to prior periods                                 | 12         | 16         |\n|                                                                        | 153        | 223        |\n| Income tax expense is attributable to:                                 |            |            |\n| Profit from continuing operations                                      | 159        | 223        |\n| Loss from discontinued operations                                      | (6)        | -          |\n|                                                                        | 153        | 223        |\n| Deferred income tax expense included in  income tax expense comprises: |            |            |\n| (Increase)/decrease in deferred tax assets                             | (13)       | 24         |\n| Increase in deferred tax liabilities                                   | 127        | 35         |\n|                                                                        | 114        | 59         |",

The tax laws and accounting standards have di/fferent rules in respect of timing and recognition of income and expense, resulting in temporary di/fferences (which reverse over time) and non-temporary di/fferences (which do not reverse over time or are temporary di/fferences that do not meet the recognition criteria under the accounting standards).\n\nIncome tax expense is calculated as the profit or loss before tax, multiplied by the applicable tax rate, and adjusted for non-temporary di/fferences. Income tax expense includes a current tax and deferred tax component and is recognised in the profit or loss, except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in equity or in other comprehensive income.\n\n## (i) Current tax\n\nCurrent tax is the expected tax payable for the period, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of prior periods. Current tax includes both temporary di/fferences and non-temporary di/fferences.\n\nThe positions taken in tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulation is subject to interpretation are periodically evaluated and provisions are provided where appropriate based on amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities.\n\nCurrent tax assets and liabilities are o/ffset where the Group has a legally enforceable right to o/ffset and intends either to settle on a net basis, or to realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously.",

Deferred tax is recognised on temporary di/fferences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities, and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements, except:\n\n- \u203a when arising on the initial recognition of goodwill;\n- \u203a when arising from the initial recognition of assets or liabilities in a transaction that is not a business combination and that a/ffects neither accounting or taxable profit; or\n- \u203a where it is not probable that future amounts will be available to utilise those temporary di/fferences or carried-forward tax losses.\n\n## (iii)  O/ffsetting deferred tax balances\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are o/ffset where there is a legally enforceable right to o/ffset and when the deferred tax balances relate to taxes levied by the same tax authority.\n\n## (iv)  Tax consolidation legislation\n\nThe Company and its wholly owned Australian entities elected to form a tax consolidated group, and are taxed as a single entity. The head entity of the tax consolidated group is Aurizon Holdings Limited.\n\nThe Company and the entities in the tax consolidated group account for their own current and deferred tax amounts. These tax amounts are measured as if each entity in the tax consolidated group continues to be a stand-alone taxpayer.\n\nIn addition to its own current and deferred tax amounts, the Company also recognises the current tax liabilities (or assets) and the deferred tax assets arising from unused tax losses and unused tax credits assumed from entities in the tax consolidated group.\n\nThe entities have entered into tax sharing and tax funding agreements. The tax funding agreement sets out the funding obligations of members of the tax consolidated group in respect of income tax amounts and requires payments to the Company equal to the current tax liability assumed by the Company. The Company is required to make payments equal to the current tax asset or deferred tax asset arising from unused tax losses and tax credits assumed from a subsidiary member. The tax funding arrangement results in the Company recognising a current inter-entity receivable or payable equal to the tax liability or tax asset assumed.\n\nThe tax sharing agreement limits the joint and several liability of the wholly owned entities in the case of a default by the Company.\n\n## (v)  Pillar Two income taxes\n\nThe Group is currently assessing the impact of AASB 2023-2 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards - International Tax Reform - Pillar Two Model Rules (the Amendments) as the Company has a subsidiary incorporated in the United Kingdom that is not an Australian resident for tax purposes. The Amendments clarify that AASB 112 Income Taxes applies to income taxes arising from tax law enacted or substantively enacted to implement the Pillar Two Model Rules published by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), including tax law that implements qualified domestic minimum top-up taxes. Such tax legislation, and the income taxes arising from it, are referred to as 'Pillar Two legislation' and 'Pillar Two income taxes'. The Group has applied the mandatory temporary exception to recognising and disclosing information about deferred tax assets and liabilities related to Pillar Two income taxes.\n\n## 5  Earnings per share\n\nEarnings per share (EPS) is the amount of post-tax profit attributable to each share. Basic EPS is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to the owners of the Company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding. Diluted EPS is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to the owners of the Company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding after adjustment for the e/ffects of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.\n\n|                                       | 2023  Cents   | 2022  Cents   |\n|---------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|\n| Basic earnings per share              |               |               |\n| Continuing operations                 | 17.6          | 27.9          |\n| Discontinued operations               | (2.6)         | -             |\n|                                       | 15.0          | 27.9          |\n| Diluted earnings per share            |               |               |\n| Continuing operations                 | 17.6          | 27.8          |\n| Discontinued operations               | (2.6)         | -             |\n|                                       | 15.0          | 27.8          |\n| Underlying basic earnings per share 1 |               |               |\n| Continuing operations                 | 19.9          | 28.5          |\n| Discontinued operations               | 1.9           | -             |\n|                                       | 21.8          | 28.5          |\n\n|                                                                            | 2023   Number   '000   | 2022   Number   '000   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|\n| Weighted average number of ordinary  shares for basic earnings per share   | 1,840,704              | 1,840,605              |\n| Dilution due to rights issued pursuant to  performance rights plans        | 3,794                  | 3,992                  |\n| Weighted average number of ordinary  shares for diluted earnings per share | 1,844,498              | 1,844,597              |",

No amounts were written o/ff in the financial year (2022: $nil).\n\n## (a)  Accounting policies\n\n## (i) Trade receivables\n\nTrade receivables are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently at amortised cost using the e/ffective interest rate method. Trade receivables are generally due for settlement within 31 days and are therefore classified as current.\n\n## (ii)  Provision for impairment\n\nThe collectability of trade and other receivables is reviewed on an ongoing basis. Individual debts which are known to be uncollectable are written o/ff when identified.\n\nThe Group recognises a provision for impairment based on expected lifetime losses of trade and other receivables. The amount of the provision for impairment is recognised in profit or loss in other expenses.\n\n## (b)  Credit risks related to receivables\n\nIn assessing an appropriate provision for impairment of trade and other receivables, consideration is given to historical experience of bad debts, the aging of receivables, knowledge of debtor insolvency and individual account assessment.\n\nThe Group's trade receivables exhibit similar credit risk characteristics and exposures. Customer credit risk is managed in accordance with the procedures and controls set out in the Group's credit risk management policy. Credit limits are established for all customers based on external and internal credit rating criteria. For some trade receivables, the Group may also obtain security in the form of guarantees, deeds of undertaking or letter of credit, which can be called upon if the counterparty is in default under the terms of the agreement.\n\n## 7  Inventories\n\n|                                      | 2023  $m   | 2022  $m   |\n|--------------------------------------|------------|------------|\n| Current                              |            |            |\n| Raw materials and stores - at cost   | 246        | 194        |\n| Provision for inventory obsolescence | (11)       | (8)        |\n|                                      | 235        | 186        |\n| Non-current                          |            |            |\n| Raw materials and stores - at cost   | 73         | 69         |\n| Provision for inventory obsolescence | (13)       | (13)       |\n|                                      | 60         | 56         |\n\n## (a)  Accounting policies\n\nInventories include infrastructure and rollingstock items held in centralised stores, workshops and depots. Items expected to be consumed after more than 12 months are classified as non-current.\n\nInventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. The cost of individual items of inventory are determined using weighted average cost.\n\nThe Group recognises a provision for inventory obsolescence based on an assessment of damaged stock, slow-moving stock and stock that has become obsolete. The amount of the provision for inventory obsolescence is recognised in profit or loss in other expenses.",

Network is responsible for the provision of access to, and operation of the regulated infrastructure assets which connect 40 coal mines to five export terminals, as well as to domestic customers. The useful life of infrastructure assets is determined based on the expected engineering life, capped at the remaining term of the infrastructure lease. In adopting this basis, the Group assumes that the infrastructure assets will remain economically viable throughout the lease term which, as explained further below, is dependent on the ongoing future supply and demand for Australian coal.\n\nAround 70% of volume hauled across the CQCN is metallurgical coal which is primarily used to produce steel. Thermal coal, which is used as a heat source in energy generation, accounts for the remaining 30% of volume hauled. Metallurgical coal is expected to be in demand for longer than thermal coal. The useful life of Network infrastructure assets will be impacted by the future supply and demand for Australian metallurgical coal rather than thermal coal.\n\nAs part of the Group's Strategy in Uncertainty framework, scenario analysis is used to test market drivers and evaluate capital, fleet and haulage opportunities, and sustainability in the context of climate change risks. A key component of this analysis is understanding the drivers of supply and demand for commodities transported over the short term as well as risks that emerge over the medium to long term. This analysis is extended over the lease term where the timing and magnitude is less certain.\n\nThe future supply of Australian metallurgical coal is dependent on government policies, including the ability of customers to gain regulatory approvals and raise funding to support the development of their resource base. Demand for Australian metallurgical coal is dependent on seaborne-traded markets which are increasingly concentrated in Asia and linked to Asian steel production. Future demand is dependent on economic development in Asia including steel intensive growth, alternatives to steel and current steel production methods, technology advancements, competing supply of metallurgical coal, and changes in government policies including preference for domestic or imported coal and net-zero emission targets. Major import nations of Australian metallurgical coal with net-zero emissions targets include India (2070), Japan (2050), South Korea (2050) and China (2060).\n\n## Regulatory framework considerations\n\nAs the CQCN is a regulated asset, Network earns a Return of Capital as part of Allowable Revenue for each coal system under the QCA approved Access Undertaking. The Return of Capital compensates Network for depreciation of the Regulatory Asset Base (RAB) over QCA endorsed regulatory lives for individual asset classes which di/ffer to the expected engineering life used for statutory reporting purposes. The QCA has also approved an accelerated depreciation profile for additions to the RAB from FY2010 onwards.\n\nAs a result, at the commencement of each regulatory period, where an asset class has a remaining regulatory useful life:\n\n- \u203a  higher than 20 years, RAB depreciation is based on a 20-year rolling life, which resets to 20 years each regulatory period\n- \u203a lower than 20 years, depreciation is calculated on a straightline basis.\n\nThe accelerated depreciation profile adopted by the QCA increases the rate at which Network recovers the Return of Capital and increases Allowable Revenue in the near term.\n\nThe QCA approved economic life of the CQCN can be re-assessed at the commencement of each regulatory period and therefore the QCA approved economic life of the CQCN RAB is not an indicator that useful lives adopted for statutory reporting purposes should be revised.\n\nThe Group assumes the regulatory framework continues throughout the lease term.\n\n## Indicators\n\nThe key drivers for the future supply and demand for Australian metallurgical coal over the short term as well as risks that emerge over the medium to long term where the timing and magnitude is less certain are reviewed annually to assess the appropriateness of useful lives assigned to Network infrastructure assets. Indicators monitored include the following:\n\n- \u203a government policies, including the ability of customers to gain regulatory approvals and raise funding to support the development of metallurgical coal reserves in the CQCN\n- \u203a global crude steel production and the share of Australian metallurgical coal used in the process\n- \u203a the viability of new and alternative technologies that are developed to reduce emissions targets such as carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS), and hydrogen-based steel making, that may positively or negatively impact future metallurgical coal demand\n- \u203a the average age of steel plants for end markets of Australian metallurgical coal\n- \u203a global supply competitiveness and Australia's share of seaborne metallurgical coal supply\n- \u203a climate policy targets and how they are intended to be met at both a country and corporate level, including net-zero emissions targets set by major import nations of Australian coal.",

Consequently, a change in indicators reviewed may result in a revision of useful lives assigned to the Network infrastructure assets in the future, resulting in a change in depreciation on a prospective basis. The graph below summarises the annual depreciation profile of the current written down value of Network infrastructure assets of $4,907 million (leased assets of $4,361 million and owned assets of $546 million) over the useful life applied for each class of assets described in note 8(b)(i) and excludes future capital investments.\n\nFIGURE 1 -NETWORK INFRASTRUCTURE ASSETS DEPRECIATION PROFILE\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Network infrastructure assets have a maximum useful life of FY2109. As an indication of sensitivity, the table below summarises the increase in annual depreciation if the maximum useful life of current Network infrastructure assets are reduced by 10, 20, 30 or 40 years.\n\n|   Reduction in maximum   useful life (years): |   Increase in annual  depreciation ($m p.a): |\n|-----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|\n|                                            10 |                                            2 |\n|                                            20 |                                            6 |\n|                                            30 |                                           10 |\n|                                            40 |                                           18 |\n\n## Useful lives of rollingstock\n\nThe Group has approximately 592 active locomotives and 13,438 active wagons, which are predominately used by the Coal and Bulk business units to transport bulk commodities and containerised freight to end customers and ports. The fleet is a mix of standard gauge and narrow gauge, with 138 active electric locomotives and 454 active diesel locomotives. The useful life of rollingstock is determined based on the expected engineering life.\n\nIn adopting the expected engineering life of rollingstock, the Group monitors a range of indicators including:\n\n- \u203a the flexibility of fleet capacity, including the ability to shift standard gauge fleet between New South Wales, Western Australia, South Australia and the Northern Territory, narrow gauge fleet between Queensland and sections of track infrastructure in South Australia and Western Australia, and between commodities within states\n- \u203a the risk of obsolescence as alternative technologies such as battery and hydrogen are developed\n- \u203a continuous improvement in fleet investment strategies such as those predicated on condition-based and preventative maintenance approaches, as well as advancements in component changeout models\n- \u203a competitors fleet mix and their associated investment profile over time.\n\nThere is a risk that the indicators monitored could positively or negatively impact the expected engineering life of rollingstock resulting in a change in depreciation on a prospective basis.\n\n## Recoverable amount of property, plant and equipment (Western Australia CGU)\n\nThe Western Australia CGU provides integrated supply chain services including road transportation and material handling for a range of products and has previously been impaired. The Western Australia CGU has a carrying amount of $333 million and includes property, plant and equipment, software and working capital. There are indicators the previously recognised impairment losses for the Western Australia CGU may no longer be required. The recoverable amount of the Western Australia CGU has been determined based on a value-in-use calculation. The estimate uses a four-year cash flow projection (2022: four-year), a pre-tax discount rate of 11.63% (2022: 11.5%) and a long-term growth rate of 2.5% (2022: 2.5%). The recoverable amount of the CGU supports the carrying amount, therefore no further impairment or impairment reversal has been recognised.\n\nThe Western Australia CGU has a small number of customers, and the recoverable amount is sensitive to changes in these customer contractual arrangements, particularly iron ore customers. The recoverable amount of the CGU was determined taking into consideration the expected expiry and renewal of iron ore customer contracts. Should contracts with customers not be renewed, or customers either cease to operate before the expected end-of-mine life, or be unable to comply with current contractual arrangements, it may result in a further impairment.\n\nIn addition, the terminal value calculation assumes a level of sustaining capital expenditure into perpetuity and the recoverable amount is sensitive to changes in this estimate. If the amount of sustaining capital expenditure required is lower or higher than the estimated amount, it may result in a further impairment or impairment reversal.",

The extension option is on the same terms as the initial lease period. Notice must be provided at least 20 years prior to the expiry of the existing term. The extension option under the corridor land leases are dependent on the infrastructure lease extension being exercised and granted.\n- 2   The Group has an option to extend the lease by a further 15 years. The extension option is on the same terms as the initial lease period. Notice must be provided at any time after the expiry of 40 years and before the expiry of 45 years after the commencement date of 7 November 1997. The extension option is dependent on the Group providing and undertaking to carry out a Renewal Investment Plan.\n- 3  Remaining lease term from 29 July 2022, being the date of acquisition of the lessee company.\n\n## Other leased assets\n\nThe Group primarily leases buildings with terms mostly ranging from one to 32 years. The leases generally provide the Group with the right to renewal at which time the lease terms are renegotiated. The Group applies the following practical expedients permitted by the standard:\n\n- \u203a payments for short-term leases of less than 12 months are recognised as an expense in profit or loss as incurred; and\n- \u203a payments for leases for which the underlying asset is of a low value are recognised as an expense in profit or loss as incurred.",

Costs include expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the items and borrowing costs that are related to the acquisition or construction of an asset. Costs may also include transfers from equity of any gains or losses on qualifying cash flow hedges of foreign currency purchases of property, plant and equipment.\n\nSubsequent costs are included in the asset's carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group. All repairs and maintenance are charged to profit or loss during the financial period in which they are incurred.",

Straight-line allocates the cost of an item of property, plant and equipment net of residual values over the expected useful life of each asset. Estimates of remaining useful life and residual values are reviewed and adjusted, if appropriate, on an annual basis.\n\nThe useful lives applied for each class of assets are:\n\n| Infrastructure, including:   |               |\n|------------------------------|---------------|\n| Tracks                       | 7 - 50 years  |\n| Track turnouts               | 20 - 25 years |\n| Ballast                      | 8 - 20 years  |\n| Civil works                  | 20 - 99 years |\n| Bridges                      | 30 - 99 years |\n| Electrification              | 20 - 50 years |\n| Field signals                | 15 - 40 years |\n| Buildings                    | 10 - 40 years |\n| Rollingstock, including:     |               |\n| Locomotives                  | 25 - 35 years |\n| Locomotives componentisation | 8 - 12 years  |\n| Wagons                       | 25 - 35 years |\n| Wagon componentisation       | 10 - 17 years |\n| Plant and equipment          | 3 - 20 years  |\n\n## (ii)  Leases\n\nAn asset and a corresponding liability, except for where the lease is prepaid, are recognised at the date at which the asset is available for use by the Group. Where the Group is a sub-lessor and the sub-lease is for the duration of the head lease, the asset recognised from the head lease is derecognised and a lease receivable equal to the present value of future lease payments receivable is recognised.\n\nAssets and liabilities arising from a lease are initially measured on a present-value basis. Lease liabilities include the net present value of the following lease payments:\n\n- \u203a fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments), less any lease incentives receivable;\n- \u203a variable lease payments that are based on an index or a rate; and\n- \u203a payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the lessee exercising that option.\n\nThe lease payments are discounted using the Group's incremental borrowing rate, being the rate that the Group would have to pay to borrow the funds necessary to obtain an asset of similar value in a similar economic environment with similar terms and conditions.\n\nOther leased assets are measured at cost comprising the following:\n\n- \u203a the amount of the initial measurement of lease liability;\n- \u203a any lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received; and\n- \u203a any initial direct costs.\n\nOther leased assets are generally depreciated over the shorter of the asset's useful life and the lease term on a straight-line basis. If the Group is reasonably certain to exercise a purchase option, the asset is depreciated over the underlying asset's useful life.\n\n## (iii)  Impairment tests for property, plant and equipment\n\nProperty, plant and equipment subject to depreciation is reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.\n\nIn testing for impairment, the recoverable amount is estimated for an individual asset or, if it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount for the individual asset, the recoverable amount for the cash generating unit (CGU) to which the asset belongs. CGUs are the smallest identifiable group of assets that generate cash flows that are largely independent from the cash flows of other assets or group of assets. Each CGU is no larger than a reportable segment.\n\nAssets are impaired if their carrying value exceeds their recoverable amount. The recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is determined as the higher of its fair value less costs of disposal or value-in-use.\n\nAn impairment loss is recognised in profit or loss if the carrying amount of the asset or a CGU exceeds its recoverable amount. Impairment losses recognised in respect of CGUs are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the CGU (group of CGUs) and then to reduce the carrying amount of other assets in the CGU (group of CGUs).\n\nWhere there is an indicator that previously recognised impairment losses may no longer exist or may have decreased, the asset is tested for impairment. The impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount of the asset and is reversed only to the extent that the carrying amount of the asset does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, had no impairment loss been recognised.",

The Group tests goodwill for impairment on at least an annual basis.\n\nThe recoverable amount of a CGU is determined based on the higher of value-in-use or fair value less costs of disposal calculations which require the use of assumptions. These calculations use cash flow projections extrapolated using estimated growth rates.\n\nThe following table presents a summary of the goodwill allocation:\n\n|   $m |   Bulk QLD |   Bulk NSW | Bulk Central   |\n|------|------------|------------|----------------|\n| 2023 |          5 |         22 | 23             |\n| 2022 |          5 |         22 | -              |",

In addition, the Group is one of the companies within the transport industry captured by the Australian Government's Safeguard Mechanism policy. The Safeguard Mechanism baseline commences from 1 July 2023 and requires a decline in the rate of 4.9% each year to be applied to all safeguard facilities to 2030. Decarbonising of the Group's operations are being pursued through a range of initiatives and investments set out in the Group's Climate Strategy and Action Plan (CSAP), including:\n\n- \u203a leveraging existing energy e/fficiency capabilities and assets, such as electrified rail in the CQCN\n- \u203a investing in the development and adoption of low-carbon technologies through the Group's $50 million Future Fleet Fund\n- \u203a integrating renewable energy into the Group's current energy mix\n- \u203a using carbon o/ffsets through project development/investment and/or purchase where required to meet decarbonsation goals.\n\nThe potential long-term financial impacts of climate change, including the cost of reaching the Group's net zero operational emissions target by 2050, are continuing to be assessed. At this stage, based on the potential to recover or pass on these costs in customer contracts, we do not consider the potential impacts of climate change to present a risk of impairment of the carrying value of any CGU.\n\nThere are risks, including factors outside of Aurizon's control which may impact assumptions. These are outlined in the Risk section of the Directors' Report.\n\n## Bulk NSW CGU\n\nThe Bulk NSW CGU provides integrated supply chain services, including rail and road transportation, port services and material handling for a range of products. The Bulk NSW CGU has a carrying amount of $151 million and includes property, plant and equipment, goodwill, software and working capital. The recoverable amount of the Bulk NSW CGU has been determined based on a fair value less costs of disposal calculation. The estimate uses a 10-year cash flow projection (2022: 20-year) based on a pipeline of known opportunities and estimated volume growth rates between nil and 1.2% per annum, a long-term growth rate of 2.5% (2022: 2.5%) and a post-tax discount rate of 8.1% (2022: 8.0%). The cash flow projections are developed using the Group's own information with benchmarking to external sources and are therefore Level 3 inputs in the fair value hierarchy.\n\nThe recoverable amount of the CGU supports the carrying amount, therefore no impairment has been recognised.\n\n## Bulk QLD CGU\n\nThe Bulk QLD CGU provides integrated supply chain services, including rail and road transportation, port services and material handling for a range of products and has previously been impaired. The Bulk QLD CGU has a carrying amount of $212 million and includes property, plant and equipment, goodwill, software and working capital. The recoverable amount of the Bulk QLD CGU has been determined based on a fair value less costs of disposal calculation (2022: value-in-use calculation). The estimate uses a four-year cash flow projection (2022: four-year) including expected volume growth relating to existing contractual arrangements and anticipated cost savings, a long-term growth rate of 2.5% (2022: 2.5%) and a post-tax discount rate of 8.1% (2022: pre-tax discount rate of 11.5%). The cash flow projections are developed using the Group's own information and are therefore Level 3 inputs in the fair value hierarchy.\n\nThe recoverable amount of the Bulk QLD CGU is sensitive to changes in customer contractual arrangements, growth in volumes and realisation of anticipated cost savings. Any reasonably possible change in these assumptions could lead to a further impairment or impairment reversal.\n\n## Bulk Central CGU\n\nThe Bulk Central CGU provides integrated supply chain services including rail transportation and material handling for a range of products. This CGU also manages the Tarcoola-to-Darwin rail infrastructure, the intrastate rail freight network in South Australia, and containerised freight services between Adelaide and Darwin. The Bulk Central CGU has a carrying amount of $1,423 million and includes property, plant and equipment, goodwill and working capital.\n\nThe recoverable amount of the Bulk Central CGU has been estimated on a fair value less costs of disposal basis. The estimate uses a 10-year cash flow projection based on a pipeline of known opportunities and estimated volume growth rates, a long term growth rate of 2.5% and a post-tax discount rate of 8.1%. The cash flow projections are developed using the Group's own information with benchmarking to external sources and are therefore Level 3 inputs in the fair value hierarchy.\n\nAs the Bulk Central CGU was recently acquired, the carrying amount approximates the recoverable amount. Goodwill of $23 million solely arose from a net deferred tax liability recognised on acquisition in accordance with accounting standards (refer to note 22 for further information). If the timing of future growth opportunities is delayed or forecast growth in volumes is not achieved, it may lead to a future impairment of the Bulk Central CGU.",

Goodwill may also arise as a result of temporary di/fferences recognised in a business combination. Goodwill is initially measured as the amount the Group paid to acquire a business over and above the fair value of net assets acquired.\n\n## (ii)  Software\n\nCosts incurred in developing products or systems, and costs incurred in acquiring software and licences that will contribute to future period financial benefits through revenue generation and/or cost reduction, are capitalised to software and systems. Costs capitalised include external direct costs of materials and services, employee costs and an appropriate portion of relevant overheads. Software development costs include only those costs directly attributable to the development phase, and are only recognised following completion of technical feasibility and where the Group has an intention and ability to use the asset. No amounts were capitalised in the year.\n\nSoftware-as-a-Service (SaaS) arrangements are service contracts which provide the right to access the cloud provider's application software over the contract period. Costs incurred to configure or customise, and the ongoing licence fees, are recognised as an expense in profit or loss. Some of these costs incurred are for the development of software code that enhances or creates additional capability to existing systems and are recognised as an intangible asset when the recognition criteria are met.\n\nSoftware is stated at historical cost, less any accumulated amortisation or impairment. Amortisation is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life which varies from three to 15 years (2022: three to 11 years).\n\n## 10 Other assets\n\n|                      | 2023  $m   | 2022  $m   |\n|----------------------|------------|------------|\n| Current              |            |            |\n| Contract assets (a)  | 11         | 9          |\n| Lease receivable (b) | 8          | 8          |\n| Other current assets | 13         | 7          |\n|                      | 32         | 24         |\n| Non-current          |            |            |\n| Contract assets (a)  | 64         | 41         |\n| Lease receivable (b) | 22         | 34         |\n|                      | 86         | 75         |\n\n## (a)  Contract assets\n\nRefer to note 2(b) for further information relating to contract assets.\n\n## (b)  Lease receivable\n\nLease receivables represent the present value of future lease payments receivable on sub-lease arrangements where the expiry of the term of the sub-lease is the same as the head lease.

The Group does not expect all employees to take the full amount of employee benefits or require payment within the next 12 months based on past experience. The current provision for employee benefits includes $120 million (2022: $100 million) that is not expected to be taken or paid within the next 12 months.\n\n## (b)  Accounting policies\n\nA provision is recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and the amount has been reliably estimated. Provisions are measured at the present value of the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation at the reporting date.\n\n## (i) Employee benefits\n\nThe provision for employee benefits includes accrued annual leave, leave loading, retirement allowances, long service leave, short-term incentive plans and termination benefits.\n\nLiabilities for wages, salaries and accumulating non-monetary benefits expected to be settled within 12 months of the reporting date, are recognised in respect of employees' services up to the end of the reporting date. They are measured at the amounts expected to be paid when the liabilities are settled.\n\nLiabilities for annual leave and long service leave are measured as the present value of expected future payments to be made in respect of services provided by employees up to the end of the reporting date. Expected future payments that are not expected to be settled within 12 months are discounted using market yield at the reporting date of Australian corporate bond rates and reflects the terms to maturity. Remeasurements as a result of adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are recognised in profit or loss.\n\nA liability for short-term incentive plans is recognised based on a formula that takes into consideration the Group and individual key performance indicators. The Group recognises a provision where contractually obliged or where there is a past practice that has created a constructive obligation.\n\nA termination benefit is payable when the Group decides to terminate the employment, or when an employee accepts redundancy in exchange for these benefits. A provision is recognised at the earlier of when the Group can no longer withdraw the o/ffer of those benefits or when the Group recognises costs for restructuring and is measured using the present value of the expected amounts to be paid to settle the obligation.\n\nEmployee benefits are presented as current liabilities in the balance sheet if the Group does not have any unconditional right to defer settlement for at least 12 months after the reporting period, regardless of when the actual settlement is expected to occur.\n\n## (ii)  Superannuation\n\nAurizon Holdings Limited and the following subsidiaries are members of the State Public Sector Superannuation Scheme (QSuper) multi-employer defined benefit superannuation plan and are required to contribute a specific percentage of employee benefits expense to fund the retirement benefits of 482 employees (2022: 546):\n\n- \u203a Aurizon Operations Limited\n- \u203a Aurizon Network Pty Ltd\n- \u203a Australia Eastern Railroad Pty Ltd\n- \u203a Australia Western Railroad Pty Ltd\n- \u203a Aurizon Intermodal Pty Ltd\n- \u203a Interail Australia Pty Ltd\n\nIn accordance with the requirements of AASB 119 Employee Benefits , given the lack of su/fficient information available, the plan is accounted for as if it were a defined contribution plan. Defined contribution superannuation expense in note 3 includes $8 million (2022: $8 million) relating to the QSuper defined benefit plan.\n\n## (iii)  Provision for insurance claims\n\nThe Group Insurance Program includes certain placements with a wholly owned captive insurance company, Iron Horse Insurance Company Pte Ltd (incorporated in the Republic of Singapore). The captive insurance company underwrites the Company and its subsidiaries for property and liability insurance. A provision is recognised for the estimated liability of known claims and an allowance for Incurred But Not Reported claims for property and liability. Estimates are based on expected claim costs.\n\n## (iv)  Litigation and workers compensation provision\n\nA provision is made for the estimated liability for workers' compensation and litigation claims. Claims are assessed separately for common law, statutory and asbestos claims. Estimates are made based on the average number of claims and average claim payments over a specified period of time. Claims that are Incurred But Not Reported are also included in the estimate.",

The present value of estimated costs is calculated by inflating estimated costs at 2.9% (2022: 2.6%) and discounting at a weighted average discount rate of 4.1% (2022: 3.8%). The unwinding of the discount is recognised in profit or loss in finance costs and the movement in the provision is recognised in profit or loss in other expenses.\n\n## CQCN\n\nThe Group is the below rail operator and economic owner of the 2,670km CQCN under long-term infrastructure and land leases as described in note 8. The CQCN is required to be managed and maintained in accordance with good operating practice. At expiry of the long-term leases, the Group has the right to remove the infrastructure (or parts of it) by agreement with the lessor or to be paid the fair market value of the infrastructure that is not removed. Therefore, no land rehabilitation provision is recognised in respect of the CQCN.\n\n## Tarcoola-to-Darwin railway and intrastate rail freight network in South Australia\n\nThe Group is the below rail operator and economic owner of the 2,245km Tarcoola-to-Darwin railway line and 215km of intrastate rail freight network in South Australia under long-term infrastructure (the Concession Deed) and land leases as described in note 8. At expiry of the Concession Deed, the Tarcoola-to-Darwin railway is required to be returned in a condition which is capable of continued operations. The Concession Deed does not require the removal of track infrastructure. At expiry of the land lease for the intrastate rail freight network in South Australia, the lessor may elect to acquire all or any part of the track infrastructure for fair market value. For any unacquired track infrastructure, the Group may remove that part of the track infrastructure or return it to the lessor. Therefore, no land rehabilitation provision is recognised in respect of the Tarcoola-to-Darwin railway or the intrastate rail freight network in South Australia.\n\n## 13 Other liabilities\n\n|                               | 2023  $m   | 2022  $m   |\n|-------------------------------|------------|------------|\n| Current                       |            |            |\n| Contract liabilities (a)      | 64         | 48         |\n| Lease liabilities (b)         | 20         | 16         |\n| Other current liabilities     | 11         | 5          |\n|                               | 95         | 69         |\n| Non-current                   |            |            |\n| Contract liabilities (a)      | 80         | 109        |\n| Lease liabilities (b)         | 114        | 107        |\n| Other non-current liabilities | 2          | 2          |\n|                               | 196        | 218        |\n\n## (a)  Contract liabilities\n\nRefer to note 2(b) for further information relating to contract liabilities.\n\n## (b)  Lease liabilities\n\nLease liabilities represent the present value of future lease payments.\n\nMinimum lease payments are as follows:\n\n|                                                                | 2023  $m   | 2022  $m   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------|------------|------------|\n| Within one year                                                | 26         | 20         |\n| Later than one year but not later than five years              | 77         | 68         |\n| Later than five years                                          | 78         | 57         |\n|                                                                | 181        | 145        |\n| Less: Discounted using the Group's incremental  borrowing rate | (47)       | (22)       |\n| Total lease liabilities                                        | 134        | 123        |\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Group monitors its capital structure by reference to gearing ratio, ability to generate free cash flow and credit rating.\n\nNet debt consists of borrowings (both current and non-current) less cash and cash equivalents. Net debt excludes lease liabilities. Net gearing ratio is defined as Net debt divided by Net debt plus Equity. Net debt and Net gearing ratio are measures of the Group's indebtedness and provides an indicator of the balance sheet strength. An alternative net gearing ratio is also disclosed and includes derivative financial instruments used to hedge market risk on borrowings and is reconciled in the Non-IFRS Financial Information on page 119.\n\n|                                 | Notes   | 2023  $m   | 2022  $m   |\n|---------------------------------|---------|------------|------------|\n| Total borrowings                | 17      | 5,142      | 3,221      |\n| Less: cash and cash equivalents |         | (92)       | (172)      |\n| Net debt                        |         | 5,050      | 3,049      |\n| Total equity                    |         | 4,353      | 4,412      |\n| Total capital                   |         | 9,403      | 7,461      |\n| Net gearing ratio               |         | 53.7%      | 40.9%      |\n| Alternative net gearing ratio   |         | 54.4%      | 42.5%      |\n\n## 15 Dividends\n\n|                                          | Cents  per share   | $m   |\n|------------------------------------------|--------------------|------|\n| Declared and paid during the period      |                    |      |\n| For the year ended 30 June 2023          |                    |      |\n| Final dividend for 2022 (100% franked)   | 10.9               | 201  |\n| Interim dividend for 2023 (100% franked) | 7.0                | 128  |\n|                                          |                    | 329  |\n| For the year ended 30 June 2022          |                    |      |\n| Final dividend for 2021 (70% franked)    | 14.4               | 265  |\n| Interim dividend for 2022 (95% franked)  | 10.5               | 194  |\n|                                          |                    | 459  |\n| Proposed and unrecognised at period end  |                    |      |\n| For the year ended 30 June 2023          |                    |      |\n| Final dividend for 2023 (60% franked)    | 8.0                | 147  |\n| For the year ended 30 June 2022          |                    |      |\n| Final dividend for 2022 (100% franked)   | 10.9               | 201  |\n\n## Franked dividends\n\nFranking credits are available to shareholders of the Company at the 30% (2022: 30%) corporate tax rate. The franking credit account balance as at 30 June 2023 was $58 million (2022: $nil). The balance of franking credits available as at the reporting date, adjusted for franking credit impact that arises from the refund of current tax receivables or the payment of current tax liabilities, is a deficit of $34 million (2022: surplus of $63 million).\n\n## 16 Equity\n\n## (a)  Contributed equity\n\n## (i) Issued capital\n\n|                 | Number  of shares  '000   |   $m |\n|-----------------|---------------------------|------|\n| At 1 July 2021  | 1,840,704                 |  207 |\n| At 30 June 2022 | 1,840,704                 |  207 |\n| At 30 June 2023 | 1,840,704                 |  207 |\n\nOrdinary shares are classified as equity. The Company does not have authorised capital or par value in respect of its issued shares. All issued shares are fully paid. Ordinary shares entitle the holder to participate in dividends, as declared from time to time, and are entitled to one vote per share at meetings of the Company. Where the Company purchases ordinary shares as a result of a share buy-back, the consideration paid, net of any related income tax benefits, is deducted from share capital and the ordinary shares are cancelled.\n\n## (ii)  Other contributed equity\n\n|                   | 2023  $m   | 2022  $m   |\n|-------------------|------------|------------|\n| Balance at 1 July | 3,467      | 3,467      |\n| Balance 30 June   | 3,467      | 3,467      |\n\nPrior to the Initial Public O/ffering in 2010, the Queensland Government (the State) made an equity contribution to the Company. This contribution was recorded separately to issued capital, in a capital distribution account (classified as capital reserve). Certain share buy-backs and incremental costs attributable to share buy-backs have been deducted from the initial contribution. The capital distribution account is treated as share capital for tax purposes.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Refer to note 27 for further details of the Group's performance rights plans.\n\nThe fair value of rights granted are recognised as an employee benefits expense in profit or loss, with a corresponding increase in the share-based payment reserve in equity, and is spread over the vesting period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to the right.\n\nWhere the Company purchases ordinary shares to satisfy performance rights plans, the consideration paid is deducted from the share-based payment reserve.\n\n## (iii)  Foreign currency translation reserve\n\nOn consolidation all exchange di/fferences arising from translation of controlled entities with a financial currency that is not Australian dollars are recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the foreign currency translation reserve. When a foreign operation is disposed of, or ceases, the cumulative amount recognised within the reserve relating to that foreign operation is transferred to profit or loss.",

The bank debt facilities, Medium-Term Notes, and US Private Placement Notes contain general undertakings including negative pledge clauses which restrict the amount of security that the Group can provide over assets in certain circumstances. The Group has complied with all required covenants and undertakings throughout the reporting period. At reporting date, the Group has a net current liability position of $117 million due to the classification of Network AMTN 2 with a notional amount of $425 million maturing June 2024 as a current liability. The proceeds from the Network US Private Placement, along with Network AMTN 6 and Network AMTN 7, will be used to repay Network AMTN 2 and replace this capacity.\n\nThe Group manages its exposure to interest rate risk as set out in note 18(a). Details of the Group's financing arrangements and exposure to risks arising from borrowings are set out in note 18(b).\n\n## (a)  Accounting policies\n\nBorrowings are initially recognised at fair value of the consideration received, less directly attributable borrowing costs. Borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the e/ffective interest rate method.\n\nDirectly attributable borrowing costs are capitalised and amortised over the expected term of the bank debt facilities, Medium-Term Notes, and US Private Placement Notes.\n\nBorrowings are classified as current liabilities, except for those liabilities where the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement for at least 12 months after the reporting period which are classified as noncurrent liabilities.",

The policies outline principles and procedures with respect to risk tolerance, delegated levels of authority on the type and use of derivative financial instruments, and the reporting of these exposures. The policies are subject to periodic reviews. The Group typically uses derivative financial instruments to hedge underlying exposures arising from operational activities relating to changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates.\n\nAurizon Operations Limited (via a wholly owned subsidiary Aurizon Finance Pty Ltd) relies on an annually reviewed duration based hedging strategy to minimise any negative impact to its financial position that may arise as a result of movements in underlying interest rates.\n\nUnder the QCA approved regulatory regime, Network receives compensation for its cost of debt through the WACC. The risk-free rate and debt risk premium used to determine WACC are based on observed market data in the 20 business days prior to a WACC reset date. This interest rate risk is managed through the establishment of financial derivatives to fix the underlying interest rate of forecast debt over this period.\n\nThe Group's overall financial risk management program focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse e/ffects on the Group's financial performance as set out in the table below:\n\n| Risk                                        | Exposure                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Mitigation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n|---------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Market risks                                |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |\n| -  Interest rate risk                       | The Group is exposed to interest rate risk in respect  to short and long-term borrowings where interest is  charged at variable rates.                                                                                                                               | The Group mitigates interest rate risk primarily by  maintaining an appropriate mix of fixed and floating rate  borrowings.

The weighted average maturity of interest rate swaps is 4.8 years (2022: less than one year).\n\n## Sensitivity\n\nThe following table summarises the gain/(loss) impact of a 100 basis points (bps) increase or decrease in interest rates on net profit and equity before tax.\n\n|                   | Increase  $m   | Decrease  $m   |\n|-------------------|----------------|----------------|\n| 2023              |                |                |\n| E/ffect on profit | (4)            | 4              |\n| E/ffect on equity | 140            | (149)          |\n| 2022              |                |                |\n| E/ffect on profit | (7)            | 7              |\n| E/ffect on equity | 18             | (19)           |\n\n## Amounts recognised in profit or loss\n\nThe Group recognised a net gain on interest rate swaps of $22 million (2022: net loss of $14 million), as a result of market interest rates (i.e. floating rates) closing higher than the fixed interest rates hedged, resulting in a gain on the floating-to-fixed interest rate swaps, partly o/ffset by a loss on the fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps. The net gain represents the e/ffective portion of hedges which have been recognised in finance expense.\n\n## (ii) E/ffects of hedge accounting\n\nThe table below summarises the hedging instruments used to manage market risk:\n\n|                                                   | 2023  $m   | 2022  $m   |\n|---------------------------------------------------|------------|------------|\n| Current assets                                    |            |            |\n| Foreign exchange contracts                        | 2          | 2          |\n| Interest rate swaps                               | -          | 42         |\n|                                                   | 2          | 44         |\n| Non-current assets                                |            |            |\n| Interest rate swaps                               | 41         | -          |\n| CCIRS - Network EMTN 1                            | 78         | 38         |\n|                                                   | 119        | 38         |\n| Total derivative financial instrument assets      | 121        | 82         |\n| Non-current liabilities                           |            |            |\n| Interest rate swaps                               | 1          | -          |\n| Interest rate swaps - Finance AMTN 1              | 63         | 66         |\n| Interest rate swaps - Network AMTN 3              | 12         | 11         |\n| Interest rate swaps - Network AMTN 4              | 104        | 105        |\n| Interest rate swaps - Network AMTN 5              | 13         | 13         |\n| Interest rate swaps - Network AMTN 6              | 3          | -          |\n| Interest rate swaps - Network AMTN 7              | 1          | -          |\n| Interest rate swaps - Network USPP                | 4          | -          |\n| CCIRS - Network EMTN 2                            | 39         | 71         |\n| CCIRS - Network USPP                              | 5          | -          |\n| CCIRS - Finance USPP                              | 7          | -          |\n| Total derivative financial instrument liabilities | 252        | 266        |\n\nThe Group has issued Australian dollar Medium-Term Notes (AMTNs), EMTNs and USPPs under its wholly owned subsidiaries Aurizon Network Pty Ltd and Aurizon Finance Pty Ltd which have separate designations in hedging relationships.",

The gain or loss on remeasurement is recognised immediately in profit or loss unless the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument, in which case the remeasurement is recognised in equity.\n\nA derivative is presented as a non-current asset or a non-current liability if the remaining maturity of the instrument is more than 12 months and it is not due to be realised or settled within 12 months. Other derivatives are presented as current assets or current liabilities.\n\n## Hedge accounting\n\nAt inception of the hedge relationship, the Group formally designated the relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk management objective for undertaking various hedge transactions. The Group also documents its assessment at hedge inception date and on an ongoing basis as to whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions have been and will continue to be highly e/ffective in o/ffsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items.\n\nThe Group enters into hedge relationships where the critical terms of the hedging instrument match exactly with the terms of the hedged item and a qualitative assessment is performed to assess e/ffectiveness. If changes in circumstances a/ffect the terms of the hedged item, such as the terms no longer match exactly with the critical terms of the hedged instrument, a hypothetical derivative method is used to assess e/ffectiveness.\n\nThe main source of hedge ine/ffectiveness is the e/ffect of the credit risk di/fferential between the Group and its respective counterparties (i.e. credit curves) on the fair value of interest rate swaps and CCIRS, which is not reflected in the fair value of the hedged item. Ine/ffectiveness may be due to di/fferences in the critical terms between the interest rate swaps and loans, in the timing of forecast transactions or any o/ff-market derivatives. Hedge ine/ffectiveness is recognised against the mark-to-market position of the derivative financial instrument and in profit or loss in finance costs.\n\n## Rebalancing\n\nIf the hedge ratio for risk management purposes is no longer optimal but the risk management objective remains unchanged and the hedge continues to qualify for hedge accounting, the hedge relationship will be rebalanced by adjusting either the volume of the hedging instrument or the volume of the hedged item so that the hedge ratio aligns with the ratio used for risk management purposes. Any hedge ine/ffectiveness is calculated and accounted for at the time of the hedge relationship rebalancing.\n\nFor the purpose of hedge accounting, hedges are classified as fair value hedges or cash flow hedges and are accounted for as set out in the table below.\n\nFair value hedge\n\nCash flow hedge\n\n| What is it?                         | A derivative or financial instrument designated as  hedging the change in fair value of a recognised asset  or liability or firm commitment. A fair value hedge is  used to swap fixed interest payments to variable interest  payments in order to manage the Group's exposure to  interest rate risk.   | A derivative or financial instrument hedging the exposure  to variability in cash flow attributable to a particular risk  associated with an asset, liability or forecasted transaction.  A cash flow hedge is used to swap variable interest rate  payments to fixed interest rate payments, or to lock in foreign  currency rates in order to manage the Group's exposure to  interest rate risk and foreign exchange risk.                                                     |\n|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Movement in fair value              | Changes in the fair value of the derivative are  recognised in profit or loss, together with the changes in  fair value of the hedged asset or liability attributable to  the hedged risk. The gain or loss relating to the e/ffective portion of  interest rate swaps hedging fixed rate borrowings are  | The e/ffective part of any gain or loss on the derivative financial  instrument is recognised in other comprehensive income  and accumulated in equity in the cash flow hedge reserve.  The change in the fair value that is identified as ine/ffective is  recognised immediately in profit or loss within other income or  other expense.                                                                                                                                       |\n| Discontinuation of hedge accounting | If the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge  accounting, the adjustment to the carrying amount of a  hedged item for which the e/ffective interest method is  used is amortised to profit or loss in finance income over  the period to maturity using a recalculated e/ffective  interest rate.  | When a hedging instrument expires or is sold or terminated,  or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge  accounting, any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity  at that time remains in equity and is recognised when the  forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in profit or loss.  When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur,  the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in equity is  immediately transferred to profit or loss. |",

Where certain credit events occur, such as default, the net position owing/receivable to a single counterparty in the same currency will be taken as owing and all the relevant arrangements terminated. The Group does not currently have legally enforceable right of set-o/ff between transaction types and therefore these amounts are presented separately in the consolidated balance sheet.\n\nISDA Master Agreements held with counterparties allow for the netting of payments and receipts for the settlement of interest rate swap transactions.\n\nThe following table presents the recognised financial instruments that are o/ffset, or subject to enforceable master netting arrangements.

The market interest rates were determined to be between 4.8% and 7.1% (2022: 1.0% and 6.6%) depending on the type of facility.\n\nThe Group measures the fair value of financial instruments using market observable data where possible. Fair values are categorised into three levels with each of these levels indicating the reliability of the inputs used in determining fair value. The levels of the fair value hierarchy are:\n\nLevel 1: Quoted prices for an identical asset or liability in an active market\n\nLevel 2: Directly or indirectly observable market data\n\nLevel 3: Unobservable market data\n\nThe fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is determined as the unrealised gain/(loss) with reference to market rates. The fair value of interest rate swaps is determined as the net present value of contracted cash flows. The existing exposure method, which estimates future cash flows to present value using credit adjusted discount factors after counterparty netting arrangements, has been adopted for both forward foreign exchange contracts and interest rate swaps.\n\nThe fair value of CCIRS is determined as the net present value of contract cash flows. The future probable exposure method is applied to the estimated future cash flows to reflect the credit risk of the Group and relevant counterparties.\n\nThe Group's derivative financial instruments are classified as Level 2 (2022: Level 2). During the period, there were no transfers between Level 1, Level 2 or Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy (2022: nil).",

The Group's share of net assets from investments in joint ventures at reporting date is $56 million (2022: $22 million).\n\n## (a)  Accounting policies\n\nInvestments in joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. Investments are initially recognised at cost and subsequently adjusted for the Group's share of net profit or loss. The carrying value of an investment is reduced by the value of dividends received from the joint venture.\n\nConsideration transferred to acquire additional shares is added to the existing carrying amount of the investment without remeasurement of the previously held interest and without specific allocation to the underlying assets and liabilities of the investee.\n\nThe carrying amount of investments are tested for impairment in accordance with the policy described in note 8.\n\n## 20   Material  subsidiaries\n\nThe ultimate parent of the Group is Aurizon Holdings Limited. The companies listed below are those whose results, in addition to the parent entity, principally a/ffect the amounts shown in the financial report:\n\n|                                      |                           | Ownership  interest   | Ownership  interest   |\n|--------------------------------------|---------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|\n| Controlled entities                  | Country of  incorporation | 2023  %               | 2022  %               |\n| Aurizon Operations Limited           | Australia                 | 100                   | 100                   |\n| Australia Eastern Railroad Pty Ltd   | Australia                 | 100                   | 100                   |\n| Australia Western Railroad Pty Ltd   | Australia                 | 100                   | 100                   |\n| Aurizon Network Pty Ltd              | Australia                 | 100                   | 100                   |\n| Aurizon Property Pty Ltd             | Australia                 | 100                   | 100                   |\n| Aurizon Finance Pty Ltd              | Australia                 | 100                   | 100                   |\n| Aurizon Port Services Pty Ltd        | Australia                 | 100                   | 100                   |\n| Aurizon Port Services NSW Pty Ltd    | Australia                 | 100                   | 100                   |\n| Aurizon Bulk Central Pty Ltd         | Australia                 | 100                   | -                     |\n| Aurizon Bulk Central Network Pty Ltd | Australia                 | 100                   | -                     |\n| Iron Horse Insurance Company Pte Ltd | Singapore                 | 100                   | 100                   |\n\n## (a)  Principles of consolidation\n\nThe consolidated financial statements incorporate the assets and liabilities of all subsidiaries of the Group as at reporting date and the results of all subsidiaries for the financial year.\n\nSubsidiaries are all entities over which the Group has control. The Group controls an entity when the Group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to a/ffect those returns through its power to direct the activities of the entity.\n\nSubsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group and de-consolidated from the date that control ceases. Transactions between continuing and discontinued operations are treated as external from the date that the operation was discontinued. Where arrangements between the continuing and discontinued operations will continue subsequent to disposal, transactions including revenue and expenses are included in continuing operations profit or loss with elimination entries recognised in profit or loss of the discontinued operation.\n\nInter-company transactions and balances are eliminated on consolidation.\n\n## (b)  Changes in ownership interest\n\nWhen the Group ceases to have control, joint control or significant influence, any retained interest in the entity is remeasured to its fair value with the change in carrying amount recognised in profit or loss. The remeasured fair value becomes the initial carrying amount for the purposes of subsequently accounting for the retained interest of an associate, joint venture or financial asset. Any amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income are accounted for as if the Group had directly disposed of the related assets or liabilities and may result in amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income being reclassified to profit or loss.\n\nIf the ownership interest in a joint venture or an associate is reduced but joint control or significant influence is retained, only a proportionate share of the amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income are reclassified to profit or loss where appropriate.",

The parent entity disclosure includes employee benefit provisions and other labour accruals for these employees.\n\n## (b)  Guarantees entered into by the parent entity\n\nThe Company has provided a Parent Company Guarantee (PCG) in favour of Moorebank Intermodal Company (MIC) as a residual obligation in relation to 50% of the cost to complete construction of Terminal Works, and 25% of the contract sum for design and construction of Rail Access. The estimated maximum exposure under the guarantee is $75 million (2022: $95 million), however the Company has obtained a 100% cross indemnity guarantee from Qube Holdings Ltd in respect of any call under the PCG.\n\nThe parent entity did not have any material contingent liabilities or contractual commitments for the acquisition of property, plant and equipment as at 30 June 2023 (2022: $nil).\n\n## 22  Acquisition of businesses and interests in joint ventures\n\n## (a)  Summary of acquisitions in 2023\n\n- (i) One Rail Australia\n\n## SIGNIFICANT JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATES\n\n## Business combination\n\nOne Rail Australia comprised two main business segments:\n\n- \u203a One Rail Bulk: Integrated rail haulage and general freight assets in South Australia and the Northern Territory and below rail operator and economic owner of 2,460km of rail infrastructure including the 2,245km Tarcoola-to-Darwin railway line; and\n- \u203a East Coast Rail: Coal haulage in New South Wales and Queensland.\n\nOne Rail Bulk has been integrated into the Group's Bulk segment and renamed Aurizon Bulk Central. Aurizon Bulk Central is the only rail freight operator along the South Australia/Northern Territory corridor and products hauled include copper, grain, iron ore, gypsum and containerised freight. Aurizon Bulk Central also manages the Tarcoola-to-Darwin rail infrastructure, and the intrastate rail freight network in South Australia. Provision of access to the below rail infrastructure is regulated by the ESCOSA.\n\nThe investments held in the East Coast Rail entities were transferred to ORAH on 29 July 2022 and classified as a discontinued operation held for sale at acquisition measured at fair value less cost of disposal. During the year, the Group completed the divestment of ORAH in accordance with the Company's Undertaking to the ACCC as part of its acquisition of One Rail Australia. Refer to note 23 for further information on the divestment of ORAH.\n\nThe allocation of the purchase price to the business segments and the determination of the fair values of net identifiable assets and goodwill involves significant judgement.\n\n## Allocation of purchase consideration\n\nThe allocation of the purchase consideration to the business segments involved judgement. The Group engaged third-party valuers to advise on the methodology and assumptions applied. The allocation of purchase consideration to the business segments was determined based on fair value methodology.\n\n## Determination of the fair value of net identifiable assets\n\nThe determination of the fair values of net identifiable assets, including property, plant and equipment and intangible assets involved judgement. The Group engaged third-party valuers to advise on the methodology and assumptions applied to value identifiable assets. The fair value was determined based on commonly adopted methodology for the identifiable assets, including depreciated replacement cost after consideration of economic obsolescence and discounted cash flows.",

The net deferred tax liability arises on leased assets (comprising leasehold interests with below market rental payments) and the face value of the Term Loan Facility, o/ffset by deferred tax assets associated with provisions. None of the goodwill is expected to be deductible for tax purposes.\n\nThe gross contractual amount due and fair value of trade receivables acquired is $44 million.\n\nBorrowings acquired includes a $50 million Term Loan Facility with The AustralAsia Railway Corporation in connection with the Tarcoola-toDarwin Concession Deed issued at below market interest rates. The Term Loan Facility matures in 2054 at the expiry of the Concession Period. The fair value of the loan acquired is $5 million.\n\nAcquisition costs of $49 million, including landholder duty, advisory fees and other costs have been expensed to profit or loss during the period and classified in other expenses. This amount has been classified as a significant item in continuing operations.\n\nTotal cash paid of $2,404 million included $1,454 million for continuing operations and $950 million for discontinued operations held for sale. Net cash outflow from investing activities for continuing operations was $1,404 million, representing cash paid net of cash acquired of $50 million.\n\nThe acquired business contributed revenue for continuing operations of $247 million for the period 29 July 2022 to 30 June 2023. If the acquisition had occurred on 1 July 2022, consolidated continuing operations pro-forma revenue for the year ended 30 June 2023 would have been $3,533 million. These amounts have been calculated using the subsidiary's results and adjusting them for di/fferences in accounting policies between the Group.\n\n## (ii)  Ox Mountain Limited\n\nThe Group increased its ownership interest in Ox Mountain Limited (UK registered), a maintenance software developer and distributor, from 42% to 69% for consideration of $30 million on 9 January 2023. The investment continues to be classified as a joint venture due to the Group having joint control and is accounted for using the equity method of accounting.\n\n## (b)  Summary of acquisitions in 2022\n\n## (i) South Maitland Railways Pty Ltd (SMR)\n\nThe Group acquired 100% of the issued shares in SMR, a railway storage and maintenance provider near Newcastle in New South Wales, for consideration of $8 million on 1 March 2022.\n\n## (ii)  Kooregah Pastoral Co Pty Ltd (KPC)\n\nThe Group acquired the business of KPC, a trucking and material handling business that operates in and around Hermidale in New South Wales, for consideration of $8 million on 28 October 2021. The acquisition included the assets and workforce associated with the business.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Total consideration includes $313 million cash proceeds received on completion of the sale and $125 million cash proceeds receivable in February 2024. On completion of the sale, Magnetic assumed ORAH's existing borrowings of $474 million.\n\n## (i) Significant items\n\nThe Group's underlying results di/ffer from the statutory results. The exclusion of certain items permits a more relevant analysis of the Group's underlying performance on a comparative basis.\n\n|                                    | 2023  $m   |\n|------------------------------------|------------|\n| Significant items                  |            |\n| Impairment of assets held for sale | (75)       |\n| Sale and divestment costs          | (26)       |\n| Loss on sale of ORAH               | (2)        |\n|                                    | (103)      |\n\nImpairment expense of $75 million ($57 million post-tax) was recognised to write down the carrying amount of net assets classified as held for sale at 31 December 2022 to the estimated recoverable amount. The reduction in the estimated recoverable amount was a result of changes in market conditions subsequent to acquisition and net assets including property, plant and equipment and intangible assets that are not depreciated or amortised while classified as held for sale, despite realising the benefit of these assets during the period.\n\nSale and divestment costs of $26 million ($23 million post-tax) recognised in discontinued operations include IT separation costs, advisory fees, legal fees and other costs.\n\nThe loss from discontinued operations after tax and significant items is reconciled in the Non-IFRS Financial Information on page 119.",

The schemes have various terms and performance measures.\n\nThis note should be read in conjunction with the Remuneration Report, as set out in the Directors' Report, which contains detailed information regarding the setting of remuneration for KMP.\n\nThe table below summarises the total movements in the performance rights issued by the Group:\n\n|           | Balance  at start of  the year  Number  '000   | Granted  during  the year  Number   '000   | Exercised  during  the year  Number  '000   | Forfeited  during  the year  Number  '000   | Balance  at end of  the year 1 Number  '000   |\n|-----------|------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|\n| 2023      |                                                |                                            |                                             |                                             |                                               |\n| STIA      | 541                                            | 553                                        | (541)                                       | -                                           | 553                                           |\n| LTIA      | 9,916                                          | 3,764                                      | (1,129)                                     | (2,076)                                     | 10,475                                        |\n| Retention | 146                                            | 176                                        | (92)                                        | (29)                                        | 201                                           |\n| Total     | 10,603                                         | 4,493                                      | (1,762)                                     | (2,105)                                     | 11,229                                        |\n| 2022      |                                                |                                            |                                             |                                             |                                               |\n| STIA      | 391                                            | 541                                        | (391)                                       | -                                           | 541                                           |\n| LTIA      | 8,512                                          | 3,364                                      | -                                           | (1,960)                                     | 9,916                                         |\n| Retention | 84                                             | 79                                         | (17)                                        | -                                           | 146                                           |\n| Total     | 8,987                                          | 3,984                                      | (408)                                       | (1,960)                                     | 10,603                                        |\n\nDuring the period, the Group recognised a share-based payment expense of $7 million (2022: $9 million).\n\nThe weighted average share price at the date performance rights were exercised during the period was $3.98 (2022: $3.71).

From 1 July 2023, the treasury management system has been updated to transition to an alternative benchmark rate of Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) and Euro Short-Term Rate (ESTR). There was no significant impact on the fair value amounts.\n\n## (ii)  New standards and interpretations not yet adopted\n\nCertain new accounting standards and amendments to standards have been published that are not mandatory for reporting periods commencing 1 July 2022 and have not been early adopted by the Group. These standards are not expected to have a material impact on the Group in the current or future reporting periods and on foreseeable future transactions.\n\nThe Group is currently assessing the impact of AASB 17 Insurance Contracts on self-insurance arrangements that is e/ffective for the Group from 1 July 2023.\n\n## (b)  Cash and cash equivalents\n\nCash and cash equivalents include cash at-bank and on-hand, and short-term money market investments with an original maturity of three months or less and are classified as financial assets held at amortised cost.\n\nCash at-bank earns interest at floating rates based on daily bank deposits. Short-term deposits are made for varying periods, depending on the immediate cash requirements of the Group and earn interest at the respective short-term deposit rates.\n\n## (c)  Foreign currency transactions\n\nItems included in the financial statements of each of the entities included within the Group are measured using the currency of the economic environment in which the entity primarily generates and expends cash. These financial statements are presented in Australian dollars, which is the functional and presentation currency of the Company.\n\nTransactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded in the functional currency of the entity using the exchange rate prevailing at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. Foreign exchange gains and losses arising from the translation of the monetary assets and liabilities, or from the settlement of foreign currency translations, are recognised in profit or loss, except when deferred in equity as qualifying cash flow hedges. The amounts deferred in equity in respect of cash flow hedges are recognised in profit or loss when the hedged item a/ffects profit or loss.\n\nAs at the reporting date, the assets and liabilities of entities within the Group that have a functional currency di/fferent from the presentation currency are translated into Australian dollars at the rate of exchange at the balance sheet date and profit or loss are translated at the average exchange for the year. The exchange di/fferences arising on the balance sheet translation are taken directly to a separate component in equity in the foreign currency translation reserve.\n\n## (d)  Business combinations\n\nThe acquisition method of accounting is used to account for all business combinations, regardless of whether equity instruments or other assets are acquired. In accordance with the acquisition method, the Group measures goodwill, at acquisition date, as the fair value of the consideration transferred less the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired. The fair value of the consideration transferred comprises the initial cash paid and an estimate for any future contingent or deferred payments the Group may be liable to pay.\n\nThe application of the acquisition method requires certain estimates and assumptions to be made particularly around the determination of fair value of any contingent or deferred consideration, the acquired intangible assets, property, plant and equipment, and liabilities assumed. Such estimates are based on information available at acquisition date.\n\nAcquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred.\n\nPredecessor value method of accounting is used to account for all business combinations that involve entities under common control. Acquired assets and liabilities are recorded at their existing carrying values and no goodwill is recorded. Retrospective presentation of the acquired entity's results and balance sheet are incorporated as if both entities had always been combined.",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the consolidated financial statements 30 June 2023 (continued)\n\n## 29   Summary of other significant accounting policies (continued)\n\n## (e)   Non-current assets (or disposal groups) held for sale and discontinued operations\n\nNon-current assets (or disposal groups) are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use and a sale is considered highly probable. They are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs of disposal, except for assets such as deferred tax assets, assets arising from employee benefits, financial assets and investment property that are carried at fair value and contractual rights under insurance contracts, which are specifically exempt from this requirement.\n\nAn impairment loss is recognised for any initial or subsequent writedown of the asset (or disposal group) to fair value less costs of disposal. A gain is recognised for any subsequent increases in fair value less costs of disposal of an asset (or disposal group), but not in excess of any cumulative impairment loss previously recognised. A gain or loss not previously recognised by the date of the sale of the non-current asset (or disposal group) is recognised at the date of derecognition.\n\nNon-current assets (including those that are part of a disposal group) are not depreciated or amortised while they are classified as held for sale. Interest and other expenses attributable to the liabilities of a disposal group classified as held for sale continue to be recognised.\n\nA discontinued operation is a component of the entity that has been disposed of or is classified as held for sale and that represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations, is part of a single co-ordinated plan to dispose of such a line of business or area of operations, or is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale. The results of discontinued operations are presented separately in the consolidated income statement.\n\n## (f)  Financial instruments\n\n## (i) Non-derivative financial assets\n\nThe Group initially recognises financial assets on the trade date at which the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. Financial assets are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the financial assets have expired or have been transferred, and the Group has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership.\n\nFinancial assets are initially measured at fair value. If the financial asset is not subsequently accounted for at fair value through profit or loss, then the initial measurement includes transaction costs that are directly attributable to the asset's acquisition or origination. On initial recognition, the Group classifies its financial assets as subsequently measured at either amortised cost or fair value, depending on its business model for managing the financial assets and the contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial assets.\n\n## (ii)  Financial assets measured at amortised cost\n\nA financial asset is subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the e/ffective interest method and net of any impairment loss, if:\n\n- \u203a  the asset is held within the business model whose objective is to hold assets in order to collect contractual cash flows; and\n- \u203a the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise, on specified dates, to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest.\n\nThe Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset (or group of financial assets) is impaired.\n\n## (iii)  Non-derivative liabilities\n\nThe Group initially recognises loans and debt securities issued on the date when they originate. Other financial liabilities are initially recognised on the trade date. The Group derecognises a financial liability when its contractual obligations are discharged or cancelled or expire.\n\nNon-derivative financial liabilities are initially recognised at fair value less any directly attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, these liabilities are measured at amortised cost using the e/ffective interest method.\n\n## (g)  Goods and Services Tax (GST)\n\nRevenue, expenses and assets are recognised net of the amount of associated GST, unless the amount of GST incurred is not recoverable from the Australian Taxation O/ffice (ATO). In this case, the GST is recognised as part of the cost of acquisition of the asset or as part of the expense.\n\nReceivables and payables are stated inclusive of the amount of GST receivable or payable. The net amount of GST recoverable from, or payable to, the ATO is included with other receivables or payables in the balance sheet.\n\nCash flows are presented in the cash flow statement on a gross basis. The GST components of cash flows arising from investing or financing activities which are recoverable from, or payable to the ATO, are presented as operating cash flows.\n\nThe Company and its subsidiaries are grouped for GST purposes. Therefore, any inter-company transactions within the Group do not attract GST.\n\n<!-- image -->",

If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n## Responsibilities of the Directors for the Financial Report\n\nThe directors of the Company are responsible for the preparation of the financial report that gives a true and fair view in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards and the Corporations Act 2001 and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of the financial report that gives a true and fair view and is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the financial report, the directors are responsible for assessing the ability of the Group to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\n## Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Report\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial report as a whole is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the Australian Auditing Standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of this financial report.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with the Australian Auditing Standards, we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n\n- \u00b7 Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial report, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- \u00b7 Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group's internal control.\n- \u00b7 Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the directors.\n- \u00b7 Conclude on the appropriateness of the directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the financial report or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.\n- \u00b7 Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial report, including the disclosures, and whether the financial report represents the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n- \u00b7 Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the financial report. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the Group's audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.\n\nWe communicate with the directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.",

We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\n\n## R Reeppoorrtt  oonn  tthhee  RReemmuunneerraattiioonn  RReeppoorrtt\n\nOpinion on the Remuneration Report\n\nWe have audited the Remuneration Report included in pages 31 to 46 of the Directors' Report for the year ended 30 June 2023.\n\nIn our opinion, the Remuneration Report of Aurizon Holdings Limited, for the year ended 30 June 2023, complies with section 300A of the Corporations Act 2001 .\n\n## Responsibilities\n\nThe directors of the Company are responsible for the preparation and presentation of the Remuneration Report in accordance with section 300A of the Corporations Act 2001 .

        "page_content": "## Non-IFRS Financial Information in the FY2023 Annual Report\n\nIn addition to using profit as a measure of the Group and its segments' financial performance, Aurizon uses EBITDA (Statutory and Underlying), EBITDA margin (Statutory and Underlying), EBIT (Statutory and Underlying), NPAT Underlying, Return On Invested Capital (ROIC), Net debt and Net gearing ratio. These measurements are not defined under IFRS and are therefore termed 'Non-IFRS' measures.\n\nEBITDA - Statutory is Group profit before net finance costs, tax, depreciation and amortisation, while EBIT - Statutory is defined as Group profit before net finance costs and tax. Underlying can di/ffer from Statutory due to exclusion of significant items that permits a more relevant analysis of the underlying performance on a comparative basis. EBITDA margin is calculated by dividing underlying EBITDA by total revenue. These measures are considered to be useful measures of the Group's operating performance because they approximate the underlying operating cash flow by eliminating depreciation and amortisation.\n\nNPAT - Underlying represents the underlying EBIT less finance costs, tax expense and the tax impact of significant items.\n\nROIC is defined as underlying rolling 12-month EBIT divided by average invested capital. Average invested capital is calculated as the rolling 12-month average of net assets (excluding cash, borrowings, tax, derivative financial assets and liabilities, and assets and liabilities held for sale). This measure is intended to ensure there is alignment between investment in infrastructure and superior returns for shareholders.\n\nNet debt consists of borrowings (both current and non-current) less cash and cash equivalents. Net debt excludes lease liabilities. Net gearing ratio is defined as Net debt divided by Net debt plus Equity. Net debt and Net gearing ratio are measures of the Group's indebtedness and provides an indicator of the balance sheet strength. An alternative Net debt and Net gearing ratio are also disclosed to include derivative financial instruments used to hedge market risk on borrowings.\n\nThese above mentioned measures are commonly used by management, investors and financial analysts to evaluate companies' performance.\n\nA reconciliation of the Non-IFRS measures and specific items to the nearest measure prepared in accordance with IFRS is included in the table. The Non-IFRS financial information contained within this Directors' report and Notes to the Financial Statements have not been audited in accordance with Australian Auditing Standards.\n\n|                                                   | 2023                      | 2023                        | 2022                      | 2022                        |\n|---------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|-----------------------------|---------------------------|-----------------------------|\n|                                                   | Continuing  operations $m | Discontinued  operations $m | Continuing  operations $m | Discontinued  operations $m |\n| NPAT -
