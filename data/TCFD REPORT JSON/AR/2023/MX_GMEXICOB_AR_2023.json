As a result, the Grupo's capital investments for the year totaled US$1.91 billion dollars.\n\nOur  strength,  determination  and  long-term  vision  are  decisive  factors  in achieving  positive  operating  and  financial  results.  Despite  the  volatile environment, in the Mining Division we consolidated the Pilares project in Sonora during 2023, which reached its total annual production capacity of 30 thousand tons of copper concentrates. Therefore, copper production grew 2.3 percent to 1,029,854 annual tons, which in part is also due to the efficiency of SPCC's operations in Peru and ASARCO's operations in Arizona.\n\nThe results that our company has achieved have been possible thanks to the perseverance, dedication and talent of our more than 30,000 highly specialized direct employees in the four countries where we operate, as well as the trust of our shareholders, who contribute capital to embody this great group of companies. 5",
