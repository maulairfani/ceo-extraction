In 2023, Connected North delivered 250 STEM sessions supporting nearly 5,000 interactions with First Nations, M\u00e9tis and Inuit youth across Canada.\n\nWe have entered a multi-year partnership with IIC which represents seven Indigenous-owned post-secondary education and training institutions in Ontario. This new partnership will support access to education and employment opportunities of Indigenous learners at these institutions by o/ffering 14 new scholarships per year for the next five years to Indigenous students.\n\n## Building financial resilience\n\nCIBC's newcomer banking bundle provides tailored financial solutions to help newcomers get setup quickly and easily and includes: free day-to-day banking for two years, no annual fee for two years on select CIBC credit cards, ease of applying for credit cards without being required to provide credit history, and a competitive referral program as well as cash o/ffers.\n\nWe also provide personalized advice and online resources to help newcomers navigate getting settled into Canada and everyday living with the CIBC Smart Newcomer Hub and CIBC Smart Guide to Canada which is available online.\n\n## Facilitating economic inclusion\n\nThrough our partnerships with the Toronto Region Immigrant Employment Council (TRIEC) and  TENT's LGBTQ+ Refugee Mentorship Program, CIBC helps newcomers navigate the job market and encourages them to explore hiring and mentorship opportunities across our Canadian operations.\n\n## Accelerating the integration to community\n\nExecuting against our vision to support newcomers, we recently partnered with the Institute of Canadian Citizenship (ICC), a national charity that supports newcomers on their journey towards full and active citizenship, championing newcomers to socially integrate and discover the best of Canada for free.

Following the economic disruption of the COVID-19 pandemic, our clients are experiencing the e/ffects of one of the most rapid ratetightening cycles in recent history as central banks combat inflation. Through it all, we continue to be there to support our clients. This means working with families to help them understand the impact of higher borrowing costs on household finances and long-term ambitions, including saving for a child's education, buying a home and retiring. It means helping businesses navigate a slower-growth environment by providing the ideas and solutions they need to move forward. And it means supporting our communities, where needs are greater than ever.\n\nAt CIBC, our team looks at today's economic conditions and understands what's possible beyond the current headlines. That's how our bank has always worked - acting to meet our clients' needs of today, but always with the long term in mind.\n\nIn keeping with that long-term focus, we made key strategic investments in recent years that have helped us not only weather the current economic shifts, but move our business forward.\n\nThrough proactive management in a more challenging environment, we generated positive operating leverage, protected net interest margin and strengthened our balance sheet throughout 2023, while continuing to pace our strategic investments to ensure our bank is well positioned for the future.'\n\nVictor G. Dodig\n\nPresident and Chief Executive O/fficer\n\nFrom our brand to the breadth of our product o/ffering, from technology to talent, these strategic investments have enabled us to drive higher revenue, deliver industry-leading growth in new clients, deepen relationships with existing clients and execute on our client-focused strategy - all with the goal of enhancing shareholder value. We have done this while maintaining an emphasis on stability, a strong balance sheet with growing capital reserves and high credit quality.\n\nWe entered 2023 taking clear, proactive actions to manage our business prudently while still making progress against our long-term objectives. Those actions proved to be timely given changes in the economy and were key to our ability to deliver solid financial performance.\n\nWe took action to make e/fficiency improvements in 2023 while continuing to invest in our bank. We also took a proactive approach to managing capital that led to a steady increase in our Common Equity Tier 1 ratio through the year. And, our robust and well-diversified balance sheet provided a solid foundation for our e/fforts to support our clients and attract new business.\n\nThe underlying strength of our business and our balance sheet was evident during the disruption in the banking sector globally this year, when our strong liquidity position and well-diversified business mix allowed us to navigate challenges in the market very e/ffectively.",

We also took a proactive approach to managing capital that led to a steady increase in our CET1 ratio through the year.'\n\nWe ended 2023 even stronger than when we started, and we are well positioned to withstand any future economic headwinds while seizing opportunities to build on our solid financial results in 2024.\n\nWe will continue to focus our e/fforts on high-growth client segments where our relationship-oriented approach positions us to outperform our peers, including in the mass a/ffluent and highnet-worth markets. We're also focused on areas where we have built-in advantages that we can leverage over time to contribute meaningfully to our financial performance. Our strong culture of connectivity di/fferentiates us in the market and is helping to drive business across our bank, notably in commercial banking and capital markets on both sides of the border. Enabling our progress is a focus on simplifying our business through technology and process enhancements, delivering a better experience for our team and our clients.\n\n## 2023 business performance\n\nWe delivered a solid financial performance for our stakeholders in 2023 in a more challenging operating environment. Our bank reported earnings of $5.0 billion or $5.16 per share, or on an adjusted basis (1) $6.5 billion or $6.72 per share. Revenue of $23.3 billion was up 7% from the prior year and adjusted pre-provision, pre-tax earnings (1) of $10.2 billion were up 8% from last year.\n\nIn 2023, regulatory capital requirements for all banks increased. We continued to build capital throughout the year, driven by internal capital generation and our dividend reinvestment plan. While issuing equity creates short-term pressure on return on equity and earnings per share, it also serves to provide a strong capital foundation that positions us well in a more fluid environment in the coming year.\n\nThrough proactive management in a more challenging environment, we generated positive operating leverage, protected net interest margin and strengthened our balance sheet throughout 2023, while continuing to pace our strategic investments to ensure our bank is well positioned for the future.\n\nOur momentum is reflected in the performance of our strategic business units.\n\n## 2023 revenue by business segment\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n$ 5.40B\n\nCanadian Commercial Banking and Wealth Management\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n$\n\n5.49B\n\nCapital Markets and Direct Financial Services\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2023 Annual Meeting of Shareholders.\n\n<!-- image -->",

This year we sharpened our focus on building this business through the introduction of a dedicated leadership structure.\n\nFollowing the acquisition of the Costco credit card portfolio in Canada, we've continued our e/fforts to introduce more of these new clients to a deeper banking relationship with our bank and we're achieving good early success. Over 90,000 Costco cardholders now have a broader banking relationship with CIBC, and over 10,000 of these clients now have an Imperial Service relationship.\n\n## Executive team\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nVictor G.

We were again recognized with the top ranking in customer satisfaction for mobile banking apps in Canada from J.D. Power, important recognition given that over 94% of transactions are now conducted outside of our banking centres.\n\n## Deepening relationships in the private economy\n\nCIBC has a long history of banking entrepreneurs and families across the private economy - a market segment where we continue to build a leadership position.\n\nOur private-economy clients are taking a more conservative approach in the near term, which led to slower loan growth but robust deposit growth in 2023 across this market.\n\nIn Canadian Commercial Banking, we continued to deliver for our clients and recorded a third consecutive year of increasing net promotor scores. This is a testament to our team's capabilities, and to enhancements we've made to the client experience, such as introducing more digitization into documents to simplify processes.\n\nFrank Guse Senior Executive Vice-President and Chief Risk O/fficer\n\n<!-- image -->",

The launch of new customer relationship management (CRM) tools and our CIBC GoalPlanner platform into CIBC Wood Gundy are increasing engagement with clients, and contributed to positive fund flows this year.\n\nIn the U.S., we continue to deepen relationships in existing markets while expanding our footprint in some of the fastestgrowing markets in the country. Our new flagship o/ffice in Palm Beach, Florida opened in the spring of 2023, and our San Francisco location is set to open in the first quarter of 2024.\n\nWe also expanded our deposit-taking capabilities with continued growth in our online CIBC Agility platform. And, through our investments in our CRM platforms, we are giving our team a broader view of client relationships across our bank to create more opportunities for referrals and a more connected approach to winning business.\n\nOn both sides of the border, we continue to be a leader in banking the innovation economy, and we've been there for our clients in changing market conditions. This market remains a priority as we see a long-term opportunity to support the vitally important technology ecosystem - one where we have clearly set ourselves apart with our superior o/ffering and our focus on building relationships with innovative companies to help them grow and thrive.\n\n## Building on success in our di/fferentiated capital markets platform\n\nIn 2023, we continued to leverage our di/fferentiated capital markets platform to drive consistent growth.\n\nOur traditional capital markets business performed well relative to peers in 2023. While equity capital raising activity remained slower than in recent years, our trading businesses delivered robust, risk-controlled growth against a backdrop of more volatile markets as we helped clients address their short- and long-term needs in a rising rate environment.\n\nIn line with our strategy, we continued to deliver double-digit revenue growth in the U.S., while furthering our connectivity\n\nacross the bank with our Direct Financial Services business to drive higher revenues and attract new clients in 2023. Through bringing our leading-edge foreign exchange and remittance capabilities to more clients and the continued growth of Simplii Financial including a refreshed brand presence, we delivered a 26% increase in Direct Financial Services revenue in 2023. Collectively, the strength of our core capital markets platform and the momentum we have in generating recurring revenues position us well in more fluid market conditions.\n\n## Enabling a more sustainable future\n\nWe are committed to a more equitable, sustainable future, and we're taking action to deliver on our ambition in this important area.\n\nOur e/fforts on climate action are focused on supporting our clients as they transition to a low-carbon economy. Our net-zero ambition includes a commitment to mobilize $300 billion in sustainable finance activity between 2018 and 2030, and interim targets for emissions reductions in our oil and gas and power generation portfolios. In addition, we have committed to providing $100 million in limited partnership investments in climate technology and energy transition funds to enable the continued growth in this important part of the market.\n\nWe're also invested in economic inclusion. In 2023, the CIBC Foundation entered its second year, a visible symbol of purpose and our commitment to community. Our 10-year commitment of $800 million in corporate giving, community sponsorships, and employee giving and fundraising (Team CIBC) globally and one million volunteer hours by Team CIBC (Canada) supports economic empowerment for underserved communities. Through our funding of programs such as the YMCA Black Achievers Mentorship Program, Connected North's CIBC STEM Learning Fund and March of Dimes Inclusive Skills training, we are contributing to an inclusive economy, where those from underserved communities can realize their ambitions.\n\nAnd we're committed to causes that matter to all of our stakeholders. The 32nd annual Canadian Cancer Society CIBC Run for the Cure had a tremendous turnout with over 50,000 participants and over $14 million raised this year. And on CIBC Miracle Day, we raised $6 million for children's charities. Both events are part of our bank's proud heritage of leadership in our communities.",

We have an inclusive, connected culture, enabling our team to be at our collective best to help our clients realize their ambitions.\n\nWe're proud of our world-class employee engagement scores, which we track annually through our employee survey. We're also proud that others see the inclusive culture we've built. This year, CIBC was named the top company in Canada for gender equality by Equileap. We were also named one of Canada's best diversity employers by MediaCorp for the 13th consecutive year.\n\nI see the impact of this culture first-hand as I travel to meet with clients, investors and all our stakeholders. I always look forward to the opportunity to spend time with our team, talk about our business and learn from our team members. I want to take this opportunity to thank them for all they do for CIBC and our clients.\n\n## Outlook for 2024\n\nWe've built our bank for the long term by investing strategically in areas that make us better, more resilient, even more clientfriendly, and where we know we can lead.\n\nAs a result, we ended 2023 in a position of strength, and we look ahead with optimism to 2024. The economic backdrop will likely remain fluid and present new challenges in some areas of the economy. Our strength and stability will stand us in good stead, while our core businesses are well positioned for the future as we harvest the benefits of our strategic investments. We are focused on enhancing total shareholder return through strong relative performance in the market, and we are confident the momentum we've established in our core businesses, including robust client growth, positions us well to deliver for all of our stakeholders moving forward.\n\nSince our founding more than a century and a half ago, we have a proven history of being there for our clients - when times are good, and when growth is slower. I am energized by the momentum we can see across our bank, and our team is motivated by the opportunities our clients are pursuing. We're more connected across our bank than ever so that we can bring the best of CIBC to our clients, and we're committed to honouring our history by helping them realize their ambitions next year and beyond.\n\nVictor G.

Against a more challenging economic backdrop in 2023, your Board continued to take a long-term view of CIBC's progress against strategic objectives while keeping a sharp focus on short-term performance.\n\n## Clear consistent strategy\n\nConsistent with the strategy presented at the bank's Investor Day in 2022, CIBC's leadership team has focused on realizing the benefits of key strategic investments, delivering clear momentum across the business, including in important areas such as attracting new clients and continued improvement in client experience scores, while managing expenses prudently. Your Board provides oversight of the execution of CIBC's clientfocused strategy, progress and performance, which are integral to delivering enduring value for all stakeholders - clients, team members, communities and shareholders.\n\n## Strong focus on risk management\n\nAs a bank, strength and stability are foundational to our ongoing performance both in the short and long-term. To this end, a key performance success in 2023 was the further building of our bank's strong liquidity, capital position, and credit management execution. This was especially important in this uncertain macroeconomic environment and was a key focus of your Board in engaging with management, our regulators, and shareholders to ensure CIBC is well positioned for 2024 and beyond.\n\n## Ongoing focus on talent and succession\n\nOur strategy and risk focus is underpinned by our Board and Management's shared commitment to talent. Building bench strength is a process that never stops. Embedded into our approach is a strong focus on growing the capabilities needed for today and into the future. It also includes ongoing engagement with management to identify, develop and advance the next generation of leaders at CIBC. Succession planning at the leadership level has always been one of your Board's most important responsibilities, and receives a great deal of focus. Comprehensive talent planning is good governance and is in the best interests of our stakeholders.\n\n## Committed to our ESG framework\n\nStewardship of CIBC's progress on environmental, social and governance matters is also a key responsibility for your Board. CIBC accelerated its actions on climate with new disclosure in its latest\n\n## Message from the Chair of the Board\n\nYour Board provides oversight of the execution of CIBC's client-focused strategy, progress and performance, which are integral to delivering enduring value for all stakeholders.'\n\nKatharine B.

Your Board supports executive compensation, as well as compensation for most team members, being tied to both financial and ESG performance, including climate targets. At the Board level, updates on the global ESG environment are part of our ongoing director development program.\n\nBuilding an inclusive team is important to Board e/ffectiveness. Your 2023 Board, comprised of directors with diverse experience, backgrounds and geographical representation, remained gender-balanced for a third consecutive year, and includes directors who identify as people of colour and a member of the LGBTQ+ community.\n\nWe continue to evolve our Board to add experience and broaden our view in areas that align with CIBC's long-term objectives and its commitment to a more inclusive economy and sustainable future. Most recently, Mr. Mark Podlasly joined your Board. Mark is the Chief Sustainability O/fficer at the First Nations Major Projects Coalition and brings deep expertise in sustainability, economic development for Indigenous communities and the development of large capital projects to our Board. We will benefit from his perspective and depth of experience in these areas.\n\nOn behalf of CIBC's shareholders and fellow board members, I'd like to thank the directors who retired in 2023, Nicholas D.

We sincerely appreciate their years of dedicated service to the Board and to CIBC.\n\n## 2024 and beyond\n\nAs we look to the future, CIBC is well positioned to execute on its targeted and disciplined growth strategy. I would like to recognize and thank Victor Dodig, our President and CEO, and our entire CIBC team, for their continued prudent management of our bank through a more challenging economic environment. Our di/fferentiated strategy and steady execution by the CIBC team has delivered growth in new clients, deeper relationships with existing clients, and a better client experience.

All such statements are made pursuant to the 'safe harbour' provisions of, and are intended to be forward-looking statements under applicable Canadian and U.S. securities legislation, including the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements include, but are not limited to, statements made in the 'Message from the President and Chief Executive Officer', 'Overview - Performance against objectives', 'Economic and market environment - Outlook for calendar year 2024', 'Significant events', 'Financial performance overview - Taxes', 'Strategic business units overview - Canadian Personal and Business Banking', 'Strategic business units overview - Canadian Commercial Banking and Wealth Management', 'Strategic business units overview - U.S. Commercial Banking and Wealth Management', 'Strategic business units overview - Capital Markets and Direct Financial Services', 'Financial condition - Capital management', 'Financial condition - Off-balance sheet arrangements', 'Management of risk - Risk overview', 'Management of risk - Top and emerging risks', 'Management of risk - Credit risk', 'Management of risk - Market risk', 'Management of risk - Liquidity risk', 'Accounting and control matters - Critical accounting policies and estimates', 'Accounting and control matters - Accounting developments', 'Accounting and control matters - Other regulatory developments' and 'Accounting and control matters - Controls and procedures' sections of this report and other statements about our operations, business lines, financial condition, risk management, priorities, targets and sustainability commitments (including with respect to net-zero emissions and our environmental, social and governance (ESG) related activities), ongoing objectives, strategies, the regulatory environment in which we operate and outlook for calendar year 2024 and subsequent periods. Forward-looking statements are typically identified by the words 'believe', 'expect', 'anticipate', 'intend', 'estimate', 'forecast', 'target', 'predict', 'commit', 'ambition', 'goal', 'strive', 'project', 'objective' and other similar expressions or future or conditional verbs such as 'will', 'may', 'should', 'would' and 'could'. By their nature, these statements require us to make assumptions, including the economic assumptions set out in the 'Economic and market environment - Outlook for calendar year 2024' section of this report, and are subject to inherent risks and uncertainties that may be general or specific. Given the continuing impact of high inflation, rising interest rates, ongoing adverse developments in the U.S. banking sector which adds pressure on liquidity and funding conditions for the financial industry, the impact of hybrid work arrangements and higher interest rates on the U.S. real estate sector, potential recession and the war in Ukraine and conflict in the Middle East on the global economy, financial markets, and our business, results of operations, reputation and financial condition, there is inherently more uncertainty associated with our assumptions as compared to prior periods. A variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control, affect our operations, performance and results, and could cause actual results to differ materially from the expectations expressed in any of our forward-looking statements. These factors include: inflationary pressures; global supply-chain disruptions; geopolitical risk, including from the war in Ukraine and conflict in the Middle East, the occurrence, continuance or intensification of public health emergencies, such as the impact of post-pandemic hybrid work arrangements, and any related government policies and actions; credit, market, liquidity, strategic, insurance, operational, reputation, conduct and legal, regulatory and environmental risk; currency value and interest rate fluctuations, including as a result of market and oil price volatility; the effectiveness and adequacy of our risk management and valuation models and processes; legislative or regulatory developments in the jurisdictions where we operate, including the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development Common Reporting Standard, and regulatory reforms in the United Kingdom and Europe, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision's global standards for capital and liquidity reform, and those relating to bank recapitalization legislation and the payments system in Canada; amendments to, and interpretations of, risk-based capital guidelines and reporting instructions, and interest rate and liquidity regulatory guidance; exposure to, and the resolution of, significant litigation or regulatory matters, our ability to successfully appeal adverse outcomes of such matters and the timing, determination and recovery of amounts related to such matters; the effect of changes to accounting standards, rules and interpretations; changes in our estimates of reserves and allowances; changes in tax laws; changes to our credit ratings; political conditions and developments, including changes relating to economic or trade matters; the possible effect on our business of international conflicts, such as the war in Ukraine and conflict in the Middle East, and terrorism; natural disasters, disruptions to public infrastructure and other catastrophic events; reliance on third parties to provide components of our business infrastructure; potential disruptions to our information technology systems and services; increasing cyber security risks which may include theft or disclosure of assets, unauthorized access to sensitive information, or operational disruption; social media risk; losses incurred as a result of internal or external fraud; anti-money laundering; the accuracy and completeness of information provided to us concerning clients and counterparties; the failure of third parties to comply with their obligations to us and our affiliates or associates; intensifying competition from established competitors and new entrants in the financial services industry including through internet and mobile banking; technological change including the use of data and artificial intelligence in our business; global capital market activity; changes in monetary and economic policy; general business and economic conditions worldwide, as well as in Canada, the U.S. and other countries where we have operations, including increasing Canadian household debt levels and global credit risks; climate change and other ESG related risks; our success in developing and introducing new products and services, expanding existing distribution channels, developing new distribution channels and realizing increased revenue from these channels; changes in client spending and saving habits; our ability to attract and retain key employees and executives; our ability to successfully execute our strategies and complete and integrate acquisitions and joint ventures; the risk that expected benefits of an acquisition, merger or divestiture will not be realized within the expected time frame or at all; and our ability to anticipate and manage the risks associated with these factors. This list is not exhaustive of the factors that may affect any of our forward-looking statements. These and other factors should be considered carefully and readers should not place undue reliance on our forward-looking statements.

We are guided by our purpose - to help make your ambition a reality, and we are activating our resources to create positive change and contribute to a more secure, equitable and sustainable future.\n\nAcross our bank and our businesses - Personal and Business Banking, Commercial Banking and Wealth Management, and Capital Markets and Direct Financial Services - our 48,000 employees bring our purpose to life every day for our 14 million personal banking, business, public sector and institutional clients in Canada, the U.S. and around the world.\n\n## Our strategy\n\nThroughout 2023, we continued to focus on executing against our ambition of building a modern, relationship-oriented bank that delivers superior client experience and top-tier shareholder returns while maintaining financial strength, risk discipline and advancing our purpose-driven culture. Going forward, we will drive long-term growth and build on our momentum through our client-focused strategy that includes four strategic priorities:\n\n- \u0081 Growing our mass affluent and private wealth franchise in Canada and the U.S.;\n- \u0081 Expanding our digital banking offering in Canada;\n- \u0081 Delivering connectivity and differentiation to commercial and capital markets clients; and\n- \u0081 Enabling, simplifying and protecting our bank.\n\n## Performance against objectives\n\nCIBC reports a scorecard of financial measures that we use to evaluate and report on our progress to external stakeholders. These measures can be categorized into four key areas - earnings growth, operating leverage, shareholder profitability and return, and balance sheet strength. We have set through the cycle targets for each of these measures, which we currently define as three to five years, assuming a normal business environment and credit cycle. Our ability to achieve these objectives may be adversely affected by extraordinary developments and disruptions.\n\nFiscal 2023 was faced with economic challenges driven by geopolitical and persistent inflationary pressures that impacted our ability to achieve certain performance objectives. Specific challenges include higher provisions for credit losses related to the U.S. office real estate portfolio, credit normalization in other portfolios, and higher capital requirements.\n\n## Earnings growth\n\nTo assess our earnings growth, we monitor our earnings per share (EPS ). Our target of 7% to 10% growth reflects a simple average of annual adjusted diluted EPS (2) . In 2023, against a backdrop of a challenging economic environment, our year-over-year reported and adjusted diluted EPS (1) was down by 23% and 5%, respectively. Our 3-year compound annual growth rates (CAGR) for reported and adjusted (2) diluted EPS were 7.9% and 11.5%, respectively, and our 5-year CAGR  for reported and adjusted diluted EPS were (2.4)% and 1.9%, respectively. (1) (2) (3) (1) (3) (2) (1) (1)\n\nGoing forward, we will continue to target an adjusted (2) diluted EPS CAGR of 7% to 10% through the cycle. (1)\n\n## Operating leverage\n\nOperating leverage, defined as the difference between the year-overyear percentage change in revenue and year-over-year percentage change in non-interest expenses, is a measure of the relative growth rates of revenue and expenses. In 2023, our reported and adjusted operating leverage was (5.2)% and 1.2%, respectively, compared with (1.9)% and (1.9)%, respectively, in 2022. Our 3-year simple average reported and adjusted operating leverage was (0.6)% and 0.0%, respectively, and our 5-year simple average reported and adjusted operating leverage was (1.5)% and (0.1)%, respectively. (2) (2) (2)\n\nGoing forward, we will continue to target positive adjusted operating leverage through the cycle.

        "page_content": "## Shareholder profitability and return\n\nWe have three metrics to measure shareholder profitability and return:\n\n## 1. Return on common shareholders' equity (ROE)\n\nROE, defined as the ratio of net income to average common shareholders' equity, is a key measure of profitability. In 2023, our reported and adjusted ROE were at 10.3% and 13.3%, respectively, compared with 14.0% and 14.7% in 2022, respectively, and below our through the cycle target of at least 16%. On a 3-year average basis, our reported and adjusted ROE were 13.5% and 14.9%, respectively. On a 5-year average basis, our reported and adjusted ROE were 13.0% and 14.4%, respectively. (1) (1) (1) (2)\n\nGoing forward, we will continue to target an adjusted ROE of at least 16% through the cycle by 2025. (1)\n\n## 2. Dividend payout ratio\n\nDividend payout ratio is defined as the ratio of common share dividends paid as a percentage of net income after preferred share dividends, premiums on preferred share redemptions, and distributions on other equity instruments. Key criteria for considering dividend increases are our current level of payout relative to our target and our view on the sustainability of our current earnings level. In 2023, our reported and adjusted dividend payout ratios were 66.6% and 51.2%, respectively, compared with 48.8% and 46.3% in 2022, respectively. On a 3-year average basis, our reported and adjusted dividend payout ratios were 52.4% and 45.9%, respectively. On a 5-year average basis, our reported and adjusted dividend payout ratios were 55.6% and 48.9%, respectively. (1) (1) (1)\n\nGoing forward, we will continue to target an adjusted dividend payout ratio of 40% to 50% through the cycle. (1)\n\n## 3. Total shareholder return (TSR)\n\nTSR is the ultimate measure of shareholder value, and the output of delivering against the financial targets within our control. We have an objective to deliver a TSR that exceeds the industry average, which we have defined as the Standard & Poor's (S&P)/Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) Composite Banks Index, over rolling three- and five-year periods. For the three years ended October 31, 2023, our TSR was 15.0% (2022: 28.5%), which was below the S&P/TSX Composite Banks Index of 36.2%. For the five years ended October 31, 2023, our TSR was 12.7% (2022: 40.2%), which was below the S&P/TSX Composite Banks Index return over the same period of 29.8%.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nReported dividend payout ratio (%) (3)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Balance sheet strength\n\nMaintaining a strong balance sheet is foundational to our long-term success. Our goal is to maintain strong capital and liquidity positions. We look to constantly balance our objectives of holding a prudent amount of excess capital for unexpected events and environmental uncertainties, investing in our core businesses, growing through acquisitions and returning capital to our shareholders.\n\n## 1. Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio\n\nWe actively manage our capital to maintain a strong and efficient capital base while supporting our business growth and returning capital to our shareholders. For the year ended October 31, 2023, our CET1 ratio was 12.4%, compared with 11.7% in 2022, well above the current regulatory requirement set by OSFI. (4)\n\nGoing forward, we will continue to maintain a strong buffer to regulatory requirements.\n\n## 2. Liquidity coverage ratio (LCR)\n\nOur ability to meet our financial obligations is measured through the LCR ratio. It measures unencumbered high-quality liquid assets (HQLA) that can be converted into cash to meet liquidity needs in a 30-calendar-day liquidity stress scenario. The LCR standard requires that, absent a situation of financial stress, the value of the ratio be no lower than 100%.\n\nFor the quarter ended October 31, 2023, our three-month daily average LCR was 135% compared to 129% for the same period last year.

For additional information and a reconciliation of reported results to adjusted results, where applicable, see the 'Non-GAAP measures' section.\n- (2)  Average balances are calculated as a weighted average of daily closing balances.\n- (3)  In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, effective March 2020, the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (OSFI) directed that all federally regulated financial institutions (FRFIs) halt share buybacks and dividend increases until further notice. The temporary measure was lifted effective November 4, 2021.\n- (4)  Our capital ratios are calculated pursuant to OSFI's Capital Adequacy Requirements (CAR) Guideline and LCR is calculated pursuant to OSFI's Liquidity Adequacy Requirements (LAR) Guideline, which are both based on Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) standards. The 2023 results reflect the impacts from the implementation of Basel III reforms that became effective as of February 1, 2023.

        "page_content": "## Economic and market environment\n\n## Year in review - 2023\n\nCanada's economy started strongly in 2023, but soon stalled as higher interest rates and a slowing global economy negatively impacted consumer spending and exports. Rapid population growth has supported consumer spending for essentials and demand for rental housing, however, discretionary purchases have started to weaken, particularly in per-capita terms. The unemployment rate, which briefly fell below 5% in 2022, is expected to climb to just under 6% by the end of the calendar year as employment increases have failed to keep up with the rapid growth of the labour force. While inflation has remained above the Bank of Canada's target, it has decelerated notably from the peaks seen in the prior year. On the household side, mortgage demand has been weak as a result of the higher interest rate environment, but the use of personal lines of credit and credit cards continued to rise after being drawn down during the pandemic. Deposits have continued to shift towards term deposits as interest rates have continued to climb. While the U.S. economy hasn't shown the same clear signs of deceleration as that of the Canadian economy, inflation has still decelerated markedly from its 2022 peaks as some of the supply chain pressures which were impacting the global economy have eased. Business loan demand has stagnated in 2023 in both Canada and the U.S. following a strong 2022.\n\n## Outlook for calendar year 2024\n\nThe generally weak global economic growth in 2023 has come in response to monetary policy tightening and below-normal growth could persist through the first half of 2024. The United Kingdom (U.K.) and some eurozone countries are likely to see recessions as higher interest rates hit a region already vulnerable due to the spillover from the war in Ukraine. China's economy has decelerated as it moved past one-time gains associated with the end of COVID-19 lockdowns. The global slowdown will result in most commodity prices at lower average levels for the remainder of calendar 2023 and into 2024 than persisted in 2022, although geopolitical risks to supply could bring upward pressure in some commodities. Supply chains should continue to see further improvement from the continued reduction in COVID-19 disruptions, and from the expected easing in global demand pressures.\n\nIn Canada, the Bank of Canada has increased the overnight rate to 5%, and the continued-high levels of core inflation mean that further increases are possible, albeit not in our base case assumption. Growth has already experienced a significant slowdown, and we expect that weakness in quarterly GDP growth will persist throughout the first half of 2024 as more households refinance mortgages at higher interest rates and cut back on discretionary purchases. Such an economic slowdown should, however, allow inflation to end next year close to its 2% target. For 2024 as a whole, we forecast growth of less than 1%, and now expect the unemployment rate to peak above 6%. However, if interest rates start to be gradually reduced before mid-year as we anticipate, growth should be stronger in the second half of 2024 and the unemployment rate should have started to move down again from that peak.\n\nWhile the U.S. has been more resilient in the face of higher interest rates so far, we expect to see further evidence of slowing consumer spending in 2024. We also expect to see GDP growth of roughly 1% in the U.S. next year, with the unemployment rate expected to climb modestly over 4%, allowing wage inflation to continue to decelerate. There are still additional downside risks to the U.S. outlook associated with a potential tightening in lending activity owing to some regional banks facing challenges in retaining deposits, higher funding costs and mark-to-market (MTM) losses on their investment security portfolios.\n\nA softer pace for economic growth is likely to have broad implications across many of our strategic business units (SBUs). Rising unemployment and the higher level for interest rates are likely to result in further moderate deterioration in business and household credit quality from very strong levels achieved in 2022. Further deterioration in credit quality in select portfolios, such as the U.S. office real estate market, could be more pronounced in response to worsening economic or market conditions. Deposit growth will be slow, as quantitative tightening will require bonds currently held by the central bank to be financed in the public markets, with higher rates resulting in greater growth in term deposits relative to short-term deposits. While we expect the rising interest rate environment to level off soon, we expect a modestly positive impact on the net interest margins for all our SBUs. However, the high interest rates may have implications for credit quality in 2024 as economic growth continues to slow in response to monetary tightening.\n\nFor Canadian Personal and Business Banking, mortgage growth is expected to remain soft, in line with weaker home sale volumes and average house prices tied to the increase in interest rates, through at least the first half of 2024. Although year-over-year non-mortgage consumer credit demand will be supported by population growth, lower inflation and weaker discretionary spending will contribute to slower growth in dollar terms. Business lending is expected to be broadly flat in the first half of 2024, before rising slightly as the economy improves towards year end.\n\nFinancial markets are starting to price in a new higher-for-longer interest rate environment, which could continue to bring volatility into the first half of 2024. Earnings growth for publicly traded entities could further decelerate in the first half of 2024, but Canadian and U.S. wealth management businesses should benefit as 2024 progresses and markets look ahead to better growth in the second half of 2024 and 2025.\n\nOur Capital Markets and Direct Financial Services business is expected to continue to benefit as merger and acquisition activity continues to recover from the low levels in early 2023, while corporate bond issuance could pick up in 2024 if longer term rates ease. Loan growth in our Canadian commercial and corporate banking businesses is expected to decelerate further in early 2024 with softer economic growth and lower levels of residential construction, before improving in the second half of the year. Loan growth and deposit growth in our U.S. commercial banking business have slowed in recent quarters, but we expect growth in early calendar 2024, which will continue to improve throughout the year.\n\nThe economic outlook described above reflects numerous assumptions regarding the economic impact of high interest rates, the easing of inflationary pressures, the impact from events in the U.S. banking sector, as well as the global economic risks emanating from the war in Ukraine, conflict in the Middle East and the slowdown in the Chinese economy. As a result, actual experience may differ materially from expectations. The impact of geopolitical events and the slowdown in the Chinese economy on our risk environment, are discussed in the 'Top and emerging risks' section. Changes in the level of economic uncertainty continue to impact key accounting estimates and assumptions, particularly the estimation of ECLs.

Non-interest income includes realized and unrealized gains and losses on securities mandatorily measured at FVTPL and income relating to changes in fair value of derivative financial instruments. Trading revenue excludes underwriting fees and commissions on securities transactions, which are shown separately in the consolidated statement of income.

This was due to the CRD tax and the retroactive impact of the 1.5% tax rate increase recognized in the current year, partially offset by the impact of lower income taxes due to earnings mix in the current year.\n\nIndirect taxes were up $34 million from 2022, due to increases in both sales taxes and payroll taxes. Sales taxes increased by $13 million from 2022, primarily due to increases in certain sales tax amounts in respect of our foreign operations. Payroll taxes were up $19 million from 2022, primarily due to increases in statutory pension and unemployment insurance contributions driven by higher employee-related compensation. Indirect taxes are included in non-interest expenses.\n\n## Canadian tax proposals\n\nThe Canadian federal government has released tax proposals that would impact CIBC if enacted. The 2023 Canadian Federal budget included a proposal to deny the deduction of dividends received by financial institutions on Canadian shares held as mark-to-market property. Draft legislation released on August 4, 2023 included a 2% buy back tax as well as a 15% global minimum tax further to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's (OECD) two-pillar plan (OECD Pillar Two). The budget proposal in respect of dividends was not included in the legislative release. The 2023 Fall Economic Statement, released on November 21, 2023, included a proposal to exclude taxable preferred shares from the application of the proposed dividend denial measure. A Notice of Ways and Means Motion to introduce a bill to implement certain measures from the 2023 Budget and the 2023 Fall Economic Statement, was released and tabled in Parliament on November 28, 2023, which included the Budget 2023 Dividend Proposal.\n\n## Foreign exchange\n\nThe estimated impact of U.S. dollar translation on key lines of our consolidated statement of income, as a result of changes in average exchange rates, is as follows:\n\n| $ millions, for the year ended October 31   | 2023  vs.  2022   | 2022  vs.  2021   |\n|---------------------------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|\n| Estimated increase in:                      |                   |                   |\n| Total revenue                               | $  225            | $  143            |\n| Provision for credit losses                 | 37                | 6                 |\n| Non-interest expenses                       | 158               | 65                |\n| Income taxes                                | 18                | 10                |\n| Net income                                  | 12                | 62                |\n| Impact on EPS : (1)                         |                   |                   |\n| Basic                                       | $  0.01           | $  0.07           |\n| Diluted                                     | 0.01              | 0.07              |\n| Average USD appreciation relative to CAD    | 4.5 %             | 2.9 %             |\n\n## Fourth quarter review\n\n| $ millions, except per share amounts, for the three months ended   | 2023     | 2023     | 2023     | 2023     | 2023     | 2022     | 2022     | 2022     |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|\n|                                                                    | Oct. 31  | Jul. 31  | Apr. 30  | Jan. 31  | Oct. 31  | Jul. 31  | Apr. 30  | Jan. 31  |\n| Revenue                                                            |          |          |          |          |          |          |          |          |\n| Canadian Personal and Business Banking                             | $  2,455 | $  2,412 | $  2,280 | $  2,260 | $  2,262 | $  2,321 | $  2,143 | $  2,183 |\n| Canadian Commercial Banking and Wealth Management                  | 1,366    | 1,350    | 1,336    | 1,351    | 1,316    | 1,338    | 1,303    | 1,297    |\n| U.S. Commercial Banking and Wealth Management                      | 672      | 666      | 648      | 706      | 653      | 604      | 591      | 609      |\n| Capital Markets and Direct Financial Services  (1)                 | 1,290    | 1,355    | 1,362    | 1,481    | 1,182    | 1,199    | 1,316    | 1,304    |\n| Corporate and Other  (1)                                           | 61       | 67       | 76       | 129      | (25)     | 109      | 23       | 105      |\n| Total revenue                                                      | $  5,844 | $  5,850 | $  5,702 | $  5,927 | $  5,388 | $  5,571 | $  5,376 | $  5,498 |\n| Net interest income                                                | $  3,197 | $  3,236 | $  3,187 | $  3,205 | $  3,185 | $  3,236 | $  3,088 | $  3,132 |\n| Non-interest income                                                | 2,647    | 2,614    | 2,515    | 2,722    | 2,203    | 2,335    | 2,288    | 2,366    |\n| Total revenue                                                      | 5,844    | 5,850    | 5,702    | 5,927    | 5,388    | 5,571    | 5,376    | 5,498    |\n| Provision for credit losses                                        | 541      | 736      | 438      | 295      | 436      | 243      | 303      | 75       |\n| Non-interest expenses                                              | 3,440    | 3,307    | 3,140    | 4,462    | 3,483    | 3,183    | 3,114    | 3,023    |\n| Income before income taxes                                         | 1,863    | 1,807    | 2,124    | 1,170    | 1,469    | 2,145    | 1,959    | 2,400    |\n| Income taxes                                                       | 380      | 377      | 436      | 738      | 284      | 479      | 436      | 531      |\n| Net income                                                         | $  1,483 | $  1,430 | $  1,688 | $  432   | $  1,185 | $  1,666 | $  1,523 | $  1,869 |\n| Net income attributable to:                                        |          |          |          |          |          |          |          |          |\n| Non-controlling interests                                          | $  8     | $  10    | $        | 11 $  9  | $ 7 $    | 6 $      | 5 $      | 5        |\n| Equity shareholders                                                | 1,475    | 1,420    | 1,677    | 423      | 1,178    | 1,660    | 1,518    | 1,864    |\n| EPS -

        "page_content": "## Management's discussion and analysis\n\nProvision for credit losses was up $105 million or 24% from the same quarter last year. Provision for credit losses on performing loans was down $154 million, largely due to a more unfavourable change in our economic outlook in the same quarter last year. Provision for credit losses on impaired loans was up $259 million, mainly attributable to Canadian Personal and Business Banking, and U.S. Commercial Banking and Wealth Management.\n\nNon-interest expenses were down $43 million or 1%, as the prior period included higher spending on strategic initiatives, including from the acquisition of the Canadian Costco credit card portfolio.\n\nIncome tax expense was up $96 million or 34%, primarily due to higher income.\n\n## Compared with Q3/23\n\nNet income for the quarter was up $53 million or 4% from the prior quarter.\n\nNet interest income was down $39 million or 1%, primarily due to lower trading net interest income, partially offset by higher net interest margin and volume growth across most of our businesses.\n\nNon-interest income was up $33 million or 1%, primarily due to higher trading non-interest income, higher card fees, partially offset by lower credit fees and lower net gains from our investment portfolios.\n\nProvision for credit losses was down $195 million or 26% from the prior quarter. Provision for credit losses on performing loans was down $195 million, primarily due to a more unfavourable change in our economic outlook in the prior quarter. Provision for credit losses on impaired loans was comparable with the prior quarter.\n\nNon-interest expenses were up $133 million or 4%, primarily due to higher spending on strategic initiatives, the impairment of our brand intangible asset related to CIBC FirstCaribbean, and an increase in legal provisions.\n\nIncome tax expense was up $3 million or 1%, primarily due to higher income.\n\n## Quarterly trend analysis\n\nOur quarterly results are modestly affected by seasonal factors. The second quarter has fewer days as compared with the other quarters, generally leading to lower earnings. The summer months (July - third quarter and August - fourth quarter) typically experience lower levels of market activity, which affects our brokerage, investment management, and capital markets activities.\n\n## Revenue\n\nRevenue in our lending and deposit-taking businesses is generally driven by volume growth, fees related to client transaction activity and the interest rate environment. Our wealth management businesses are driven by net sales activity impacting AUA and AUM, the level of client investment activity and market conditions. Capital markets revenue is also influenced, to a large extent, by market conditions affecting client trading, underwriting and advisory activity.\n\nCanadian Personal and Business Banking has benefitted from loan and deposit growth through the last eight quarters driven by organic client growth, franchising our client base, and the completion of the acquisition of the Canadian Costco credit card portfolio in the second quarter of 2022. In more recent periods, the rising rate environment has contributed to slower growth in loans and deposits and improved net interest margin, through wider deposit margins, partially offset by compressed loan margins.\n\nCanadian Commercial Banking and Wealth Management revenue has benefitted from commercial banking volume growth, offset by marketrelated headwinds in wealth management. In commercial banking, revenue growth was driven by robust client demand that has tempered in recent quarters and from an increase in interest rates. In wealth management, AUA and AUM growth and associated fee income has been impacted by volatility in equity markets along with the impact of macro environmental factors.\n\nU.S. Commercial Banking and Wealth Management has benefitted from increased loan volumes, net flows and fee income. This is offset by market-related headwinds in wealth management due to market volatility, and the recent slowing in loan growth and deposit decreases.\n\nCapital Markets and Direct Financial Services had lower trading revenue in the third and fourth quarters of 2022 and 2023. The first quarter of 2023 had higher trading revenue driven by robust market conditions and strong client activity.\n\nCorporate and Other included the impact of an increase in funding costs starting in the second quarter of 2022 from an increase in credit spreads. Rising interest rates since the second quarter of 2022 have resulted in higher margins in International banking.\n\n## Provision for credit losses\n\nProvision for credit losses is dependent upon the credit cycle, on the credit performance of the loan portfolios, and changes in our economic outlook. We continue to operate in an uncertain macroeconomic environment due to concerns related to higher levels of interest rates and inflation, geopolitical events and slower economic growth. There is considerable judgment involved in the estimation of expected credit losses in the current environment.\n\nThe first quarter of 2022 reflected a moderate improvement in economic conditions as well as our economic outlook. Faster than expected pace of interest rate increases, along with rising inflation, continued supply chain disruption and the increase in global geopolitical concerns, impacted our provision for credit losses on performing loans in the second, third and fourth quarters of 2022, and the third and fourth quarters of 2023. Unfavourable credit migration also impacted our provision for credit losses on performing loans in the first, second and third quarters of 2023. An unfavourable outlook for the U.S. real estate and construction sector contributed to an increase in provision for credit losses on performing loans in the second, third and fourth quarters of 2023.\n\nIn Canadian Personal and Business Banking, lower insolvencies and write-offs in credit cards relative to pre-pandemic levels impacted the first and second quarters of 2022. The decrease in insolvencies was in line with the national Canadian trend and the decrease in write-offs was a benefit from the household savings that built up during the pandemic. Commencing in the second quarter of 2022, our loan losses included write-offs from the seasoning of the acquired Canadian Costco credit card portfolio. Starting from the third quarter of 2022, consumer write-offs have trended higher.\n\nIn Canadian Commercial Banking and Wealth Management, we have seen higher provisions on impaired loans in fiscal 2023.\n\nIn U.S. Commercial Banking and Wealth Management, the first, second and fourth quarters of 2022, and all quarters of 2023 included higher provisions on impaired loans. The increased provision in the second, third and fourth quarters of 2023 was mainly attributable to the real estate and construction sector.\n\n- In Capital Markets and Direct Financial Services, impaired loan losses have continued to remain low.\n\nIn Corporate and Other, provisions for impaired loans have remained relatively stable. The fourth quarter of 2023 included a provision reversal.",

        "page_content": "## Non-interest expenses\n\nNon-interest expenses have fluctuated over the period largely due to changes in employee compensation expenses, investments in strategic initiatives and movement in foreign exchange rates. The second and fourth quarters of 2022, and the first quarter of 2023 included increases in legal provisions in Corporate and Other, all shown as items of note. The second quarter of 2023 included a decrease in legal provisions, shown as an item of note. The fourth quarter of 2022 included charges related to the consolidation of our real estate portfolio as a result of our move to our new global headquarters, both shown as items of note.\n\n## Income taxes\n\nIncome taxes vary with changes in taxable income in the jurisdictions in which the income is earned. The first quarter of 2023 included an income tax charge taken to recognize the CRD tax and the retroactive impact of the 1.5% tax rate increase, which was shown as an item of note.\n\n## Review of 2022 financial performance\n\n|      | $ millions, for the year ended October 31   | Canadian  Personal and  Business  Banking   | Canadian  Commercial Banking  and Wealth  Management   | U.S.  Commercial Banking  and Wealth  Management   | Capital Markets  and Direct  Financial  Services  (1)   | Corporate  and Other (1)   | CIBC  Total   |\n|------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|---------------|\n| 2022 | Net interest income                         | $  6,657                                    | $  1,672                                               | $  1,655                                           | $  2,814                                                | $  (157)                   | $  12,641     |\n|      | Non-interest income                         | 2,252                                       | 3,582                                                  | 802                                                | 2,187                                                   | 369                        | 9,192         |\n|      | Total revenue                               | 8,909                                       | 5,254                                                  | 2,457                                              | 5,001                                                   | 212                        | 21,833        |\n|      | Provision for (reversal of) credit losses   | 876                                         | 23                                                     | 218                                                | (62)                                                    | 2                          | 1,057         |\n|      | Non-interest expenses                       | 4,975                                       | 2,656                                                  | 1,328                                              | 2,437                                                   | 1,407                      | 12,803        |\n|      | Income (loss) before income taxes           | 3,058                                       | 2,575                                                  | 911                                                | 2,626                                                   | (1,197)                    | 7,973         |\n|      | Income taxes                                | 809                                         | 680                                                    | 151                                                | 718                                                     | (628)                      | 1,730         |\n|      | Net income (loss)                           | $  2,249                                    | $  1,895                                               | $  760                                             | $  1,908                                                | $  (569)                   | $  6,243      |\n|      | Net income (loss) attributable to:          |                                             |                                                        |                                                    |                                                         |                            |               |\n|      | Non-controlling interests                   | $  -

The decrease in net income of $203 million was due to higher non-interest expenses and a higher provision for credit losses, partially offset by higher revenue.\n\n## Consolidated CIBC\n\n## Net interest income\n\nNet interest income was up $1,182 million or 10% from 2021, primarily due to volume growth across our businesses, partially offset by lower trading income.\n\n## Non-interest income\n\nNon-interest income was up $636 million or 7% from 2021, primarily due to higher trading revenue, higher fee-based revenue driven by higher average AUA and AUM in our wealth management businesses, growth in fees related to commercial borrowing, and higher fees in Canadian Personal and Business Banking, partially offset by lower equity and debt issuance revenue and lower net realized gains from dispositions of FVOCI debt securities.\n\n## Provision for credit losses\n\nProvision for credit losses was up $899 million or 569% from 2021, as provisions for performing loans in 2022 reflected an unfavourable change in our economic outlook, while 2021 benefitted from a favourable change in our economic outlook driven by the recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n## Non-interest expenses\n\nNon-interest expenses were up $1,268 million or 11% from 2021, primarily due to higher employee-related and performance-based compensation, higher spending on strategic initiatives, an increase in legal provisions and costs associated with the acquisition of the Canadian Costco credit card portfolio in 2022, both shown as items of note.\n\n## Income taxes\n\nIncome tax expense was down $146 million or 8% from 2021, primarily due to lower income and also an increase in the relative proportion of income subject to lower rates of income tax.",

Commercial banking revenue was up $451 million or 25%, primarily due to higher net interest income from loan and deposit growth, higher deposit spreads that benefitted from the rising interest rate environment, and higher fees. Wealth management revenue was up $133 million or 5%, primarily due to higher fee-based revenue driven by higher average AUA and AUM reflecting market appreciation and the impact of net sales, and higher net interest income, mainly from deposits, partially offset by lower commission revenue from decreased client activity.\n\n## U.S. Commercial Banking and Wealth Management\n\nRevenue was up $263 million or 12% from 2021. Commercial banking revenue was up $169 million or 12%, primarily due to higher net interest income from loan growth, higher fees from loan syndication, and the impact of foreign exchange translation, partially offset by lower loan margins. Wealth management revenue was up $94 million or 13%, primarily due to higher net interest income from deposit growth, higher deposit margins, the impact of foreign exchange translation, and higher fee-based revenue driven by higher average AUA and AUM balances and net sales.\n\n## Capital Markets and Direct Financial Services\n\nRevenue was up $481 million or 11% from 2021. Global markets revenue was up $246 million or 12%, primarily due to higher foreign exchange, global collateral finance and equity derivatives trading revenue, partially offset by lower commodities trading revenue. Corporate and investment banking revenue was up $84 million or 5%, primarily due to higher corporate banking and advisory revenue, and higher gains from our investment portfolios, partially offset by lower equity and debt underwriting activity. Direct financial services revenue was up $151 million or 18%, primarily due to higher revenue from Simplii Financial, and higher volumes and growth in our foreign exchange and payments business, partially offset by lower trading volumes in direct investing.\n\n## Corporate and Other\n\nRevenue was down $269 million or 56% from 2021. International banking revenue was up $91 million, primarily due to the impact of foreign exchange translation, higher net product spreads that benefitted from the rising interest rate environment, and higher fee-based revenue in International banking. Other revenue was down $360 million, primarily due to lower treasury revenue related to an increase in funding costs from higher credit and liquidity spreads.",

        "page_content": "## Non-GAAP measures\n\nWe use a number of financial measures to assess the performance of our business lines as described below. Some measures are calculated in accordance with GAAP (IFRS), while other measures do not have a standardized meaning under GAAP, and accordingly, these measures may not be comparable to similar measures used by other companies. Investors may find these non-GAAP measures, which include non-GAAP financial measures and non-GAAP ratios as defined in National Instrument 52-112 'Non-GAAP and Other Financial Measures Disclosure', useful in understanding how management views underlying business performance.\n\n## Adjusted measures\n\nManagement assesses results on a reported and adjusted basis and considers both as useful measures of performance. Adjusted measures, which include adjusted total revenue, adjusted provision for credit losses, adjusted non-interest expenses, adjusted income before income taxes, adjusted income taxes and adjusted net income, in addition to the adjusted measures noted below, remove items of note from reported results to calculate our adjusted results. Items of note include the amortization of intangible assets, and certain items of significance that arise from time to time which management believes are not reflective of underlying business performance. We believe that adjusted measures provide the reader with a better understanding of how management assesses underlying business performance and facilitates a more informed analysis of trends. While we believe that adjusted measures may facilitate comparisons between our results and those of some of our Canadian peer banks, which make similar adjustments in their public disclosure, it should be noted that there is no standardized meaning for adjusted measures under GAAP.\n\nWe also adjust our results to gross up tax-exempt revenue on certain securities to a TEB, being the amount of fully taxable revenue, which, were it to have incurred tax at the statutory income tax rate, would yield the same after-tax revenue. See the 'Strategic business units overview' section and Note 30 to our consolidated financial statements for further details.\n\n## Adjusted diluted EPS\n\nWe adjust our reported diluted EPS to remove the impact of items of note, net of income taxes, to calculate the adjusted EPS.\n\n## Adjusted efficiency ratio\n\nWe adjust our reported revenue and non-interest expenses to remove the impact of items of note and gross up tax-exempt revenue to bring it to a TEB, to calculate the adjusted efficiency ratio.\n\n## Adjusted operating leverage\n\nWe adjust our reported revenue and non-interest expenses to remove the impact of items of note and gross up tax-exempt revenue to bring it to a TEB, to calculate the adjusted operating leverage.\n\n## Adjusted dividend payout ratio\n\nWe adjust our reported net income attributable to common shareholders to remove the impact of items of note, net of income taxes, to calculate the adjusted dividend payout ratio.\n\n## Adjusted return on common shareholders' equity\n\nWe adjust our reported net income attributable to common shareholders to remove the impact of items of note, net of income taxes, to calculate the adjusted return on common shareholders' equity.\n\n## Adjusted effective tax rate\n\nWe adjust our reported income before income taxes and reported income taxes to remove the impact of items of note, to calculate the adjusted effective tax rate.\n\n## Pre-provision, pre-tax earnings\n\nPre-provision, pre-tax earnings is calculated as revenue net of non-interest expenses, and provides the reader with an assessment of our ability to generate earnings to cover credit losses through the credit cycle, as well as an additional basis for comparing underlying business performance between periods by excluding the impact of provision for credit losses, which involves the application of judgments and estimates related to matters that are uncertain and can vary significantly between periods. We adjust our pre-provision, pre-tax earnings to remove the impact of items of note to calculate the adjusted pre-provision, pre-tax earnings. As discussed above, we believe that adjusted measures provide the reader with a better understanding of how management assesses underlying business performance and facilitates a more informed analysis of trends.\n\n## Allocated common equity\n\nCommon equity is allocated to the strategic business units (SBUs) based on the estimated amount of regulatory capital required to support their businesses (as determined for the consolidated bank pursuant to Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institution's (OSFI's) regulatory capital requirements and internal targets). Unallocated common equity is reported in Corporate and Other. Allocating capital on this basis provides a consistent framework to evaluate the returns of each SBU commensurate with the risk assumed. As part of the adoption of the Basel III reforms, a revised approach for allocating operational risk RWA to each of the SBUs was introduced effective April 30, 2023. The new allocations are driven by the contributions of each SBU to the total 3 years of revenue and total 10 years of operational losses. This change in methodology impacted allocated common equity effective the third quarter of 2023. For additional information, see the 'Risks arising from business activities' section.\n\n## Segmented return on equity\n\nWe use return on equity on a segmented basis as one of the measures for performance evaluation and resource allocation decisions. While return on equity for total CIBC provides a measure of return on common equity, return on equity on a segmented basis provides a similar metric based on allocated common equity to our SBUs. As a result, segmented return on equity is a non-GAAP ratio. Segmented return on equity is calculated as net income attributable to common shareholders for each SBU expressed as a percentage of average allocated common equity, which is the average of monthly allocated common equity during the period.",

        "page_content": "## Strategic business units overview\n\nCIBC has four SBUs - Canadian Personal and Business Banking, Canadian Commercial Banking and Wealth Management, U.S. Commercial Banking and Wealth Management, and Capital Markets and Direct Financial Services. These SBUs are supported by the following functional groups - Technology, Infrastructure and Innovation, Risk Management, People, Culture and Brand, Finance and Enterprise Strategy, as well as other support groups, which all are included within Corporate and Other. The expenses of these functional and support groups are generally allocated to the business lines within the SBUs. Corporate and Other also includes the results of CIBC FirstCaribbean and other portfolio investments, as well as other income statement and balance sheet items not directly attributable to the business lines.\n\n## Business unit allocations\n\nRevenue, expenses, and other balance sheet resources related to certain activities are generally allocated to the lines of business within the SBUs. Treasury activities impact the financial results of the SBUs. Each line of business within our SBUs is charged or credited with a market-based cost of funds on assets and liabilities, respectively, which impacts the revenue performance of the SBUs. This market-based cost of funds takes into account the cost of maintaining sufficient regulatory capital to support business requirements, including the cost of preferred shares. Once the interest and liquidity risks inherent in our client-driven assets and liabilities are transfer priced into Treasury, they are managed within CIBC's risk framework and limits. Capital is attributed to the SBUs based on the estimated amount of regulatory capital required to support their businesses, which is intended to consistently measure and align the costs with the underlying benefits and risks associated with SBU activities. Earnings on unattributed capital remain in Corporate and Other. We review our transfer pricing methodologies on an ongoing basis to ensure they reflect changing market environments and industry practices.\n\nWe use a Product Owner/Customer Segment/Distributor Channel allocation management model to measure and report the results of operations of various lines of business within our SBUs. The model uses certain estimates and methodologies to process internal transfers between the impacted lines of business for sales, renewals and trailer commissions as well as certain attributable costs. Periodically, the sales, renewals and trailer commission rates paid to customer segments for certain products/services are revised and applied prospectively.\n\nThe non-interest expenses of the functional and support groups are generally allocated to the business lines within the SBUs based on appropriate criteria and methodologies. The basis of allocation is reviewed periodically to reflect changes in support to business lines. Other costs not directly attributable to business lines remain in Corporate and Other.\n\nWe recognize provision for credit losses on both impaired (stage 3) and performing (stages 1 and 2) loans in the respective SBUs.\n\n## Revenue, taxable equivalent basis\n\nCertain SBUs evaluate revenue on a TEB. In order to arrive at the TEB amount, the SBUs gross up tax-exempt revenue on certain securities to a TEB, being the amount of fully taxable revenue, which, were it to have incurred tax at the statutory income tax rate, would yield the same after-tax revenue. Simultaneously, an equivalent amount is booked as an income tax expense resulting in no impact on the net income of the SBUs. This measure enables comparability of revenue arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The total TEB adjustments of the SBUs are offset in revenue and income tax expense in Corporate and Other.\n\n## Canadian Personal and Business Banking\n\nCanadian Personal and Business Banking provides personal and business clients across Canada with financial advice, services and solutions through banking centres, as well as mobile and online channels to help make their ambitions a reality.\n\n## Our business strategy\n\nWe are focused on helping our clients achieve their ambitions, and delivering sustainable, market-leading performance. To achieve this, our strategy continues to comprise three key priorities:\n\n- \u0081 Delivering personalized advice to our clients in a way that is meaningful and relevant to each of them;\n- \u0081 Introducing more opportunities for our clients to deal with us digitally by investing in digital and real-time remote capabilities; and\n- \u0081 Providing our team with the tools to deliver an excellent experience for our clients consistent with a one-team approach.\n\n## 2023 progress\n\nWe delivered solid business results having made important investments in high-touch, high-growth markets and furthering our strengths in technology and talent. We attracted a substantial number of new clients to our bank and deepened relationships with existing clients as we helped them navigate a changing market with expert advice. As an example, thousands of Costco cardholders now have a CIBC Imperial Service relationship, positioning us to offer these clients the advice and solutions they need for the long term. Our client satisfaction scores are a testament to our team and the relationships we have with our clients. In the Ipsos Customer Satisfaction Index Study, we continued to narrow our gap to the leader for our primary clients' net promotor score and were the only bank to improve year-over-year. In the J.D. Power Client Satisfaction Survey, we ranked #3, gaining on the leader year-over-year. In addition, we ranked #1 in customer satisfaction with mobile banking apps in the J.D. Power 2023 Mobile Banking App Satisfaction Study for the third time since 2020.",

Non-interest income was down $92 million or 4% from 2022, primarily due to lower fee revenue, including from lower card fees, partially due to the commodity tax charge related to the retroactive impact of the 2023 Canadian Federal budget, shown as an item of note.\n\nNet interest margin on average interest-earning assets was up 9 basis points, mainly due to higher deposit margins, partially offset by lower loan margins.\n\n## Provision for credit losses\n\nProvision for credit losses was up $110 million or 13% from 2022. Provision for credit losses on performing loans was down primarily due to the unfavourable change in our economic outlook in the prior year, as well as a provision related to the acquisition of the Canadian Costco credit card portfolio in the second quarter last year. Provision for credit losses on impaired loans was up, primarily due to higher write-offs in credit cards and personal lending.\n\n## Non-interest expenses\n\nNon-interest expenses were up $199 million or 4% from 2022, primarily due to higher spending on strategic initiatives, including the Canadian Costco credit card portfolio, and higher employee-related compensation, including from higher employee termination costs, and performancebased compensation.\n\n## Income taxes\n\nIncome taxes were up $80 million or 10% from 2022, primarily due to higher income and increased taxes arising from the 2022 Canadian Federal budget, which included the 1.5% tax rate increase.\n\n## Average assets\n\nAverage assets were up $14.7 billion or 5% from 2022, primarily due to growth in residential mortgages and cards, including from the acquisition of the Canadian Costco credit card portfolio.",

To deliver on this, our three key strategic priorities continue to be:\n\n- \u0081 Delivering risk-controlled growth in our Commercial Bank;\n- \u0081 Accelerating the growth of Private Wealth; and\n- \u0081 Evolving our Asset Management business.\n\n## 2023 progress\n\nIn 2023, our purpose-driven team maintained a strong focus on clients through an evolving economic environment by supporting their short- and long-term ambitions. This year, the effect of rapidly rising interest rates and ongoing inflationary pressures slowed the Canadian commercial landscape. As higher interest rates impacted cash flows and affected Canadian consumers and businesses, entrepreneurs grew more cautious about undertaking new initiatives and taking on more debt. Against a backdrop of moderate economic growth, Commercial Banking continued to deliver consistent financial performance, and disciplined risk and expense management, while delivering new digital tools and technology to simplify the experience of clients and team members. In Private Wealth, we launched or extended tools such as CIBC GoalPlanner to support our advisors in delivering expert financial advice and deepening client relationships. In Asset Management, we launched our modern and digitallyenabled CIBC Investment Platform, which will drive significant gains in advisor productivity. Across our businesses, our teams maintained strong referral momentum resulting in deeper client relationships and reinforcing our commitment to helping them achieve their ambitions.\n\n## Delivering risk-controlled growth in our Commercial Bank\n\n- \u0081 Achieved our highest-ever net promotor score results, highlighting the results of our investments in advisory capabilities and support services.\n- \u0081 Expanded our targeted industry programs, including adding to our Innovation Banking team in North America and the U.K., and continued growth of our National Industry Programs.\n- \u0081 Continued our journey to modernize our commercial banking systems including completing the rollout of Precision Lender, launching DocuSign and implementing a new Client Sales and Support model to better address the transactional support needs of our clients.\n\n## Accelerating the growth of Private Wealth\n\n- \u0081 Wood Gundy was ranked second overall amongst the Big 5 banks by Investment Executive Brokerage Report Card - a strong statement on the confidence of our advisory team.\n- \u0081 Launched an industry leading Client Relationship Management tool with CIBC Private Wealth, supporting effective client relationship management.\n- \u0081 Launched CIBC GoalPlanner, our digital goal-setting platform into CIBC Wood Gundy to support financial planning discussions with clients.\n\n## Evolving our Asset Management business\n\n- \u0081 Launched CIBC Investment Platform, our state-of-the-art platform that streamlines account structures, improves onboarding and client reporting, and provides enhanced portfolio management capabilities for advisors.\n- \u0081 Ranked #3 among the Big 6 banks in long-term mutual fund sales and key institutional wins with large pension plans in Japan and Australia.\n- \u0081 Extended our alternatives product suite with the launch of CIBC Alternative Credit fund and our partnership with Ares on Private Credit.\n- \u0081 Continued to invest in programs designed to overcome underrepresentation, including through the CIBC Asset Management Chartered Financial Analyst Indigenous Scholarship Program and the Ivey School of Business Women in Asset Management Program.",

Provision for credit losses on performing loans was up primarily due to an unfavourable change in our economic outlook and unfavourable credit migration. Provision for credit losses on impaired loans was up due to higher provisions in the education, health and social services, and the retail and wholesale sectors.\n\n## Non-interest expenses\n\nNon-interest expenses were up $35 million or 1% from 2022, primarily due to higher spending on strategic initiatives and higher employee termination costs, partially offset by lower performance-based compensation and other expenditures.\n\n## Income taxes\n\nIncome taxes were up $11 million or 2% from 2022, despite lower income, primarily due to increased taxes arising from the 2022 Canadian Federal budget, which included the 1.5% tax rate increase.\n\n## Average assets\n\nAverage assets were up $6.9 billion or 8% from 2022, primarily due to growth in commercial loans.\n\n## Assets under administration\n\nAUA on a spot basis were up $7.1 billion or 2% from 2022, primarily due to net new client flows.

As business owners take a more conservative approach to borrowing in a higher rate environment, demand for loans has moderated, however, deposit performance has stabilized and AUM/AUA net flows are positive - both encouraging indicators for the long term.

The current year included a provision for credit losses on performing loans due to unfavourable credit migration, while last year included a provision reversal due to a favourable change in our economic outlook. The current year included a modest provision for credit losses on impaired loans, while last year included a provision reversal on impaired loans mainly attributable to reversals in the oil and gas sector.\n\n## Non-interest expenses\n\nNon-interest expenses were up $284 million or 12% from 2022, primarily due to higher spending on strategic initiatives, higher employee-related compensation, including from higher employee termination costs and performance-based compensation, and higher legal provisions in the current year.\n\n## Income taxes\n\nIncome taxes were up $44 million or 6% from 2022, due to increased taxes arising in part from the 2022 Canadian Federal budget, which included the 1.5% tax rate increase.\n\n## Average assets\n\nAverage assets were up $3.3 billion or 1% from 2022, primarily due to higher customer liabilities under acceptances, higher securities purchased under resale agreements and higher trading securities, partially offset by lower loan balances and lower derivative valuations.",

Provision reversal on performing loans was down as the same period last year included a favourable impact resulting from model parameter updates which reflected improved post-pandemic conditions. Provision for credit losses on impaired loans was down due to lower provisions in International banking.\n\n## Non-interest expenses\n\nNon-interest expenses were up $890 million from 2022, mainly due to an increase in legal provisions, including those shown as an item of note, higher expenses in International banking, and higher employee terminations costs, partially offset by a pension plan amendment gain.\n\n## Income taxes\n\nIncome tax benefit was down $220 million from 2022, due to increased taxes arising in part from the 2022 Canadian Federal budget, which included the CRD tax and the 1.5% tax rate increase.",

Further details on the composition of loans and acceptances are provided in the 'Supplementary annual financial information' section and Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nDerivative instruments decreased by $9.8 billion or 23%, largely driven by decreases in foreign exchange and other commodity derivatives valuation, partially offset by an increase in interest rate derivatives valuation.\n\nOther assets decreased by $7.2 billion or 15%, primarily due to decreases in collateral pledged for derivatives and broker receivables, partially offset by an increase in accrued interest receivable.\n\n## Liabilities\n\nTotal liabilities as at October 31, 2023 were up $29.3 billion or 3% from 2022, of which approximately $6 billion was due to the appreciation of the U.S. dollar.\n\nDeposits increased by $25.8 billion or 4%, primarily due to increased wholesale funding, domestic retail volume growth, and business and government deposits.

For further details see the 'Capital management' section.\n\n## Equity\n\nEquity as at October 31, 2023 increased by $2.8 billion or 6% from 2022, primarily due to a net increase in retained earnings from net income that exceeded dividends and distributions and the issuance of common shares primarily related to our shareholder investment plan.

Our overall capital management objective is to maintain a strong and efficient capital base that:\n\n- \u0081 Acts as a buffer to absorb unexpected losses while providing sustainable returns to our shareholders;\n- \u0081 Enables our businesses to grow and execute on our strategy;\n- \u0081 Demonstrates balance sheet strength and our commitment to prudent balance sheet management; and\n- \u0081 Supports us in maintaining a favourable credit standing and raising additional capital or other funding on attractive terms.\n\nWe actively manage our capital to meet these objectives in support of our overall enterprise strategy. We also consider the economic outlook, and the overall operating environment when deploying our capital and may choose to operate with greater levels of capital based on our view of potential downside risks.\n\n## Capital management and planning framework\n\nWe maintain a capital management policy that establishes our capital management principles in the context of our risk appetite to support our capital management objectives. Our capital management policy is reviewed and approved by the Board of Directors (the Board) in support of our Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP). The policy includes guidelines that relate to capital strength, capital mix, dividends and return of capital, and unconsolidated capital adequacy of regulated entities, based on regulatory requirements and our risk appetite. The level of capital and capital ratios are continually monitored relative to our regulatory minimums and internal targets and the amount of capital required may change in relation to our business growth, risk appetite, and the business and regulatory environment.\n\nCapital planning is a crucial element of our overall financial planning process and establishment of strategic objectives and is developed in accordance with the capital management policy. Each year, a capital plan and three-year outlook are developed as part of the financial plan, which establishes targets for the coming year and business plans to achieve those targets. The capital plan is also stress-tested as a part of our enterprise-wide stress testing process to ensure CIBC is adequately capitalized through severe but plausible stress scenarios (see the 'Enterprisewide stress testing' section for further details). Our capital position and forecasts are monitored throughout the year and assessed against the capital plan.\n\nThe Board, with endorsement from the Risk Management Committee (RMC), provides oversight of CIBC's capital management through the approval of our risk appetite, capital policy and plan. The RMC and the Board are provided with regular updates on our capital position including performance to date, updated forecasts, and any material regulatory developments that may impact our future capital position. Treasury is responsible for the overall management of capital including planning, forecasting, and execution of the plan, with senior management oversight provided by the Global Asset Liability Committee (GALCO).\n\n## Enterprise-wide stress testing\n\nWe perform enterprise-wide stress testing on at least an annual basis. The results are an integral part of our ICAAP, as defined by Pillar 2 of the Basel III Accord, wherein we identify and measure our risks on an ongoing basis in order to ensure that the capital available is sufficient to cover all risks across CIBC, including the impacts of stress testing. We maintain a process that determines plausible but stressed economic scenarios such as global recessions and housing price shocks, and then apply these stress scenarios to our bank-wide exposures to determine the impact on the consolidated statement of income, RWA requirements, and consequently, key capital ratios. This helps us analyze the potential risks within our portfolios and establish prudent capital levels in excess of the regulatory minimum requirements. All of the elements of capital are monitored throughout the year and the capital plan is adjusted as appropriate.\n\nManagement determines the range of scenarios to be tested. Macroeconomic stress test scenarios are designed to be both severe and plausible and designed to be consistent with OSFI's stress testing framework to ensure that they are comprehensive.",

        "page_content": "## Management's discussion and analysis\n\nThe following diagram summarizes the enterprise-wide stress testing process including the development of scenarios, identification of risk drivers and linkages to our other bank-wide ICAAP processes. The process includes syndication with our economists and lines of business to ensure scenarios are relevant to our businesses and there is a consistent interpretation of the scenarios across CIBC.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nStress test scenarios are designed to capture a wide range of macroeconomic and financial variables that are relevant to assess the impact on our specific portfolios. This includes, for example, GDP, unemployment, house prices, interest rates and equity prices.\n\nThe stress testing process is comprehensive, using a bottoms-up analysis of each of our bank-wide portfolios, and the results are analyzed on a product, location and sector basis. Our stress testing approach combines the use of statistical models and expert judgment to ensure the results are reasonable in estimating the impacts of the stress scenarios.\n\nStress testing methodologies and results are subject to a detailed review and challenge from both our lines of business and Risk Management. Stress testing results are presented for review to the RMC and are also shared with the Board and OSFI. The results of our enterprise-wide stress testing are used to highlight any vulnerabilities and ensure we remain well capitalized against regulatory and management expectations.\n\nA key objective of the enterprise-wide stress tests is to identify key areas of exposure and foster discussion of management actions that would be taken to mitigate the impact of stress scenarios. Contingency planning and strategies for extreme stress scenarios are included in the development and maintenance of CIBC's recovery and resolution plans. These plans include credible remedial actions that may be considered to counteract and recover from stress, or promote CIBC's orderly resolution with limited systemic impacts. Additional information on stress testing is provided in the 'Management of risk' section.\n\n## Recovery plan\n\nFRFIs must maintain robust and credible recovery plans that identify options to restore financial strength and viability when under severe stress. CIBC continues to maintain and update its recovery plan in line with OSFI requirements and industry best practices.\n\n## Resolution plan\n\nThe Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation (CDIC) Resolution Planning By-law establishes a statutory framework pursuant to which domestic systemically important banks (D-SIBs) submit and maintain resolution plans that are critical to support resolvability and financial sector stability. CDIC, Canada's resolution authority for its member institutions, including D-SIBs, has issued guidance for the development, maintenance and testing of comprehensive resolution plans and related strategies to demonstrate their operational capability, thus ensuring resolvability can be achieved in an orderly fashion. CIBC's resolution plan has been developed and maintained in alignment with guidance and is in compliance with CDIC's Resolution Planning By-law.",

        "page_content": "## Regulatory capital and total loss absorbing capacity (TLAC) requirements\n\nOur regulatory capital requirements are determined in accordance with guidelines issued by OSFI, which are based upon the capital standards developed by the BCBS.\n\nRegulatory capital consists of CET1, Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital. Qualifying regulatory capital instruments must be capable of absorbing loss at the point of non-viability of the financial institution.\n\nThe tiers of regulatory capital indicate increasing quality/permanence and the ability to absorb losses. The major components of our regulatory capital are summarized as follows:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## CET1 capital\n\n- \u0081  Common equity (retained earnings, common shares and stock surplus)\n- \u0081  Accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) (1)\n- \u0081  Qualifying instruments issued by a consolidated banking subsidiary to third parties\n- \u0081  Less regulatory deductions for items such as:\n- Goodwill and other intangible assets\n- Deferred tax assets\n- Net assets related to defined benefit pension plans\n- Certain investments\n\n## Additional Tier 1 (AT1) capital\n\n- \u0081  Non-viability contingent capital (NVCC) preferred shares\n- \u0081  Limited recourse capital notes\n- \u0081  Qualifying instruments issued by a consolidated subsidiary to third parties\n\n## Tier 2 capital\n\n- \u0081  NVCC subordinated indebtedness\n- \u0081  Eligible general allowance\n- \u0081  Qualifying instruments issued by a consolidated subsidiary to third parties\n- (1)  Excluding AOCI relating to cash flow hedges and changes to fair value option (FVO) liabilities attributable to changes in own credit risk.\n\nOSFI requires all institutions to achieve target capital ratios which include buffers. Targets may be higher for certain institutions at OSFI's discretion. CIBC has been designated by OSFI as a domestic systemically important bank (D-SIB) in Canada. D-SIBs are subject to a CET1 surcharge equal to 1.0% of RWA. In addition, OSFI expects D-SIBs to hold a Domestic Stability Buffer (DSB) requirement intended to address Pillar 2 risks that are not adequately captured in the Pillar 1 capital requirements. The DSB was 3.0% as of October 31, 2023, which was increased from 2.5% effective February 1, 2023, but can range from 0% to 4.0% of RWA (see the 'Continuous enhancement to regulatory capital and TLAC requirements' section for additional details). Additionally, banks need to hold an incremental countercyclical capital buffer equal to their weighted-average buffer requirement in Canada and across certain other jurisdictions where they have private sector credit exposures.\n\nIn addition, the Basel III capital standards include a non-risk-based capital metric, the leverage ratio, to supplement risk-based capital requirements. The leverage ratio is defined as Tier 1 capital divided by the leverage ratio exposure. The leverage ratio exposure is defined under the standards as the sum of:\n\n- (i) On-balance sheet assets less Tier 1 capital regulatory adjustments;\n- (ii) Derivative exposures;\n- (iii) Securities financing transaction exposures; and\n- (iv) Off-balance sheet exposures (such as commitments, direct credit substitutes, letters of credit, and securitization exposures).\n\nUnder OSFI's TLAC guideline, D-SIBs are required to maintain a supervisory target TLAC ratio (which builds on the risk-based capital ratios) and a minimum TLAC leverage ratio (which builds on the leverage ratio). TLAC is defined as the aggregate of total capital and other TLAC instruments primarily comprised of bail-in eligible instruments with a residual maturity greater than 365 days. TLAC is required to ensure that a non-viable D-SIB has sufficient loss absorbing capacity to support its recapitalization. This would, in turn, facilitate an orderly resolution of the D-SIB while minimizing adverse impacts on the financial sector stability and taxpayers.\n\nOSFI's current regulatory capital and TLAC targets are summarized below. Targets may be higher for certain institutions at OSFI's discretion. We are in compliance with all current capital, leverage and TLAC requirements imposed by OSFI.\n\n| As at October 31, 2023   | Minimum   | Capital  conservation  buffer   | D-SIB  buffer   | Pillar 1  targets  (1)   | Domestic  Stability  Buffer  (2)   | Target including  all buffer  requirements   |\n|--------------------------|-----------|---------------------------------|-----------------|--------------------------|------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|\n| CET1 ratio               | 4.5 %     | 2.5 %                           | 1.0 %           | 8.0 %                    | 3.0 %                              | 11.0 %                                       |\n| Tier 1 capital ratio     | 6.0 %     | 2.5 %                           | 1.0 %           | 9.5 %                    | 3.0 %                              | 12.5 %                                       |\n| Total capital ratio      | 8.0 %     | 2.5 %                           | 1.0 %           | 11.5 %                   | 3.0 %                              | 14.5 %                                       |\n| Leverage ratio  (3)      | 3.0 %     | n/a                             | 0.5 %           | 3.5 %                    | n/a                                | 3.5 %                                        |\n| TLAC ratio               | 18.0 %    | 2.5 %                           | 1.0 %           | 21.5 %                   | 3.0 %                              | 24.5 %                                       |\n| TLAC leverage ratio  (3) | 6.75 %    | n/a                             | 0.5 %           | 7.25 %                   | n/a                                | 7.25 %                                       |\n\n- (1)  The countercyclical capital buffer applicable to CIBC is insignificant as at October 31, 2023.\n\nTier 1 capital",

        "page_content": "## Continuous enhancement to regulatory capital and TLAC requirements\n\nThe BCBS and OSFI have published a number of proposals for changes to the existing regulatory capital requirements to strengthen the regulation, supervision, and practices of banks, with the overall objective of enhancing financial stability. The discussion below provides a summary of Basel III reforms and revised Pillar 3 disclosure requirements and BCBS and OSFI publications that have been issued since our 2022 Annual Report.\n\n## Basel III reforms and revised Pillar 3 disclosure requirements\n\nOn January 31, 2022, OSFI released final capital, leverage, liquidity and disclosure guidelines that incorporate the final Basel III reforms, as well as certain updates to the treatment of credit valuation adjustments (CVA), market risk hedges of other valuation adjustments of over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives and management of operational risk. Primary changes include:\n\n- \u0081 Revisions to both the IRB approach and standardized approach to credit risk;\n- \u0081 Revised operational risk framework based on income and historical operational losses;\n- \u0081 Revised market risk and CVA frameworks;\n- \u0081 Updated CET1 capital deductions for certain assets;\n- \u0081 An updated capital output floor based on the revised standardized approach noted above, with the phase-in of the floor adjustment factor over three years at 65.0% commencing in the second quarter of 2023 and rising 2.5% per year to 72.5% in the first quarter of 2026;\n- \u0081 Modification to the leverage ratio framework, including a buffer requirement for D-SIBs; and\n- \u0081 Enhancements to the LAR Guideline, including changes to net cumulative cash flow (NCCF) requirements.\n\nThese changes were implemented in the second quarter of 2023, with the exceptions of revisions to the CVA and market risk frameworks, which will be implemented in the first quarter of 2024. In addition, related revisions to existing Pillar 3 disclosure requirements were implemented in the second quarter of 2023, and new Pillar 3 disclosures were implemented in the fourth quarter of 2023 for D-SIBs. The impact to the CET1 ratio from the Basel III reforms are noted below in the 'Regulatory capital, leverage and TLAC ratios' section.\n\nOn November 11, 2021, the BCBS published 'Revisions to market risk disclosure requirements', which included a number of adjustments to reflect the revised market risk framework introduced in January 2019. OSFI requires implementation of the 2019 market risk framework in the first quarter of 2024.\n\nOn November 14, 2023, OSFI released the final amendments to the Pillar 3 Disclosure Guidelines to incorporate the market risk and CVA risk disclosures of the Basel Framework. These amendments are applicable for D-SIBs designated by OSFI to apply the market risk framework of the Capital Adequacy Requirements Guideline and will be effective for CIBC for the fiscal year-end 2024 reporting period.\n\n## Domestic Stability Buffer\n\nOn December 8, 2022, OSFI increased the upper limit of the DSB's range from 2.5% to 4.0% of total RWA in response to existing market conditions and elevated economic uncertainties. The DSB was 3.0% as of July 31, 2023, which was increased from 2.5% effective February 1, 2023. On June 20, 2023, OSFI further announced an increase to the DSB from 3.0% to 3.5%, effective November 1, 2023. As a result, OSFI's target capital ratios, including all buffers, for CET1, Tier 1 and Total capital will increase to 11.5%, 13.0% and 15.0% respectively, effective November 1, 2023.\n\n## Parental Stand-Alone (Solo) TLAC Framework\n\nOn September 12, 2023, OSFI published final guideline for the Solo TLAC Framework for D-SIBs with an implementation date of November 1, 2023. The Solo TLAC ratio is built on the risk-based TLAC ratio set out in the TLAC Guideline and the risk-based capital ratios described in the CAR Guideline. The risk-based Solo TLAC ratio will be the primary basis used by OSFI to measure the sufficiency of loss capacity that is readily available to the parent bank on a stand-alone, legal entity basis.\n\nWe continue to monitor and prepare for developments impacting regulatory capital and TLAC requirements and disclosures.",

The increase in operational risk RWA was mainly from the treatment of legal provisions under the revised operational risk framework pursuant to the Basel III reforms implemented in the second quarter of 2023. There was a net increase in credit risk RWA from an increase in asset size, the net impact of foreign currency translation, model updates and portfolio migration. This was partially offset by the implementation of the Basel III reforms, and the benefit of a risk transfer transaction. The decrease in market risk RWA was largely the result of a decrease in risk levels and model updates. For additional information, see the 'Components of risk-weighted assets' section.\n\n## Tier 1 capital ratio\n\nThe Tier 1 capital ratio at October 31, 2023 increased 0.6% from October 31, 2022, primarily due to the factors affecting the CET1 ratio noted above.\n\n## Total capital ratio\n\nThe Total capital ratio at October 31, 2023 increased 0.7% from October 31, 2022, primarily due to the factors affecting the Tier 1 capital ratio noted above and a net increase in NVCC subordinated debentures and eligible allowances included in Tier 2 capital.

        "page_content": "## Leverage ratio\n\nThe leverage ratio at October 31, 2023, decreased 0.2% from October 31, 2022, as the impact of an increase in Tier 1 capital was more than offset by the impact of an increase in leverage ratio exposure. The increase in leverage ratio exposure was primarily driven by the discontinuation of the temporary exclusion of Central bank reserves from the on-balance sheet exposure measure.\n\n## TLAC ratio and TLAC leverage ratio\n\nThe TLAC ratio at October 31, 2023 increased 0.6% from October 31, 2022, driven by an increase in TLAC, partially offset by an increase in RWA. The increase in TLAC was primarily a result of higher total capital due to the factors noted above and issuances of bail-in eligible liabilities. The TLAC leverage ratio at October 31, 2023 decreased 0.6% from October 31, 2022, primarily due to the factors affecting the leverage ratio exposure as noted above, partially offset by an increase in TLAC.\n\n## Movement in total regulatory capital\n\nChanges in regulatory capital under Basel III are presented in the table below:\n\n| $ millions, for the year ended October 31                                        | 2023      | 2022      |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| CET1 capital                                                                     |           |           |\n| Balance at beginning of year                                                     | $  37,005 | $  33,751 |\n| Shares issued in lieu of cash dividends (add back)                               | 1,155     | 153       |\n| Other issue of common shares                                                     | 203       | 248       |\n| Purchase of common shares for cancellation                                       | -         | (29)      |\n| Premium on purchase of common shares for cancellation                            | -         | (105)     |\n| Net income attributable to equity shareholders                                   | 4,995     | 6,220     |\n| Dividends and distributions                                                      | (3,416)   | (3,125)   |\n| Change in AOCI balances                                                          |           |           |\n| Currency translation differences                                                 | 351       | 1,753     |\n| Securities measured at FVOCI                                                     | 228       | (889)     |\n| Cash flow hedges  (1)                                                            | (364)     | (799)     |\n| Fair value change of FVO liabilities attributable to changes in credit risk      | (106)     | 262       |\n| Post-employment defined benefit plans                                            | (240)     | 198       |\n| Removal of own credit spread (net of tax)                                        | 197       | (468)     |\n| Shortfall of allowance to expected losses                                        | -         | -         |\n| Goodwill and other intangible assets (deduction, net of related tax liabilities) | (171)     | (943)     |\n| Other, including regulatory adjustments and transitional arrangements  (1)(2)    | 490       | 778       |\n| CET1 capital balance at end of year                                              | $  40,327 | $  37,005 |\n| AT1 capital                                                                      |           |           |\n| Balance at beginning of year                                                     | $  4,941  | $  4,593  |\n| AT1 eligible capital issues                                                      | -         | 1,400     |\n| Impact of the cap on inclusion for instruments subject to phase out  (3)         | -         | (251)     |\n| Redeemed capital                                                                 | -         | (800)     |\n| Other, including regulatory adjustments                                          | 2         | (1)       |\n| AT1 capital balance at end of year                                               | $  4,943  | $  4,941  |\n| Tier 2 capital                                                                   |           |           |\n| Balance at beginning of year                                                     | $  6,317  | $  5,858  |\n| New Tier 2 eligible capital issues                                               | 1,750     | 1,000     |\n| Redeemed capital                                                                 | (1,500)   | -         |\n| Impact of the cap on inclusion for instruments subject to phase out              | -         | (451)     |\n| Other, including change in regulatory adjustments  (2)                           | 282       | (90)      |\n| Tier 2 capital balance at end of year                                            | $  6,849  | $  6,317  |\n| Total capital balance at end of year                                             | $  52,119 | $  48,263 |",

CIBC's issued and outstanding common shares to be effected through an amendment to CIBC's by-laws. On April 7, 2022, CIBC shareholders approved the Share Split. Each shareholder of record at the close of business on May 6, 2022 (Record Date) received one additional share on May 13, 2022 (Payment Date) for every one share held on the Record Date. All common share numbers and per common share amounts have been adjusted to reflect the Share Split as if it was retroactively applied to the beginning of 2022.\n\n## Capital initiatives\n\nThe following were the main capital initiatives undertaken since our 2022 Annual Report:\n\n## Normal Course Issuer Bid (NCIB)\n\nOur normal course issuer bid expired on December 12, 2022. Under this bid, we purchased and cancelled 1,800,000 common shares at an average price of $74.43 for a total amount of $134 million during the first quarter of 2022.\n\n## Employee share purchase plan\n\nPursuant to the employee share purchase plan, we issued 3,081,055 common shares (on a post share split basis) for consideration of $176 million for the year ended October 31, 2023.\n\n## Shareholder investment plan\n\nPursuant to the shareholder investment plan, we issued 21,455,322 common shares (on a post share split basis) for consideration of $1,155 million for the year ended October 31, 2023.",

On November 29, 2023, the CIBC Board of Directors approved an increase in our quarterly common share dividend from $0.87 per share to $0.90 per share for the quarter ending January 31, 2024.\n\nCommon and preferred share dividends are declared quarterly at the discretion of the Board. The declaration and payment of dividends is governed by Section 79 of the Bank Act (Canada), the terms of the preferred shares, as explained in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Subordinated indebtedness\n\nOn January 20, 2023, we issued $1.0 billion principal amount of 5.33% Debentures due January 20, 2033. The Debentures bear interest at a fixed rate of 5.33% per annum (paid semi-annually) until January 20, 2028, and at Daily Compounded Canadian Overnight Repo Rate Average (CORRA) plus 2.37% per annum (paid quarterly) thereafter until maturity on January 20, 2033. These debentures qualify as Tier 2 capital.\n\nOn April 4, 2023, we redeemed $1.5 billion principal amount of 3.45% Debentures due April 4, 2028. In accordance with their terms, the Debentures were redeemed at 100% of their principal amount, together with accrued and unpaid interest thereon.\n\nOn April 20, 2023, we issued $750 million principal amount of 5.35% Debentures due April 20, 2033. The Debentures bear interest at a fixed rate of 5.35% per annum (paid semi-annually) until April 20, 2028, and at Daily Compounded CORRA plus 2.23% per annum (paid quarterly) thereafter until maturity on April 20, 2033. These debentures qualify as Tier 2 capital.\n\n## Non-cumulative Rate Reset Class A Preferred Shares Series 47 (NVCC)\n\nHolders of the Non-cumulative Rate Reset Class A Preferred Shares Series 47 (NVCC) (Series 47 shares) had the option to convert their shares into Non-cumulative Floating Rate Class A Preferred Shares Series 48 (NVCC) (Series 48 shares) on a one-for-one basis on January 31, 2023. As the conditions for conversion were not met, no Series 48 shares were issued, and all of the Series 47 shares remain outstanding. The dividend on the Series 47 shares was reset to 5.878%, payable quarterly as and when declared by the Board, effective for the five-year period commencing January 31, 2023.\n\nSee the 'Outstanding share data' section below and Note 15 to our consolidated financial statements for further details.\n\n## Outstanding share data\n\nThe table below provides a summary of our outstanding shares, NVCC capital instruments, and the maximum number of common shares issuable on conversion/exercise:\n\n|                                                                                    | Shares outstanding   | Shares outstanding   | Minimum                                  | Maximum number                                     |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|\n| $ millions, except number of shares and per share amounts, as at November 24, 2023 | Number  of shares    | Amount               | conversion  price per  common share  (1) | of common shares  issuable on  conversion/exercise |\n| Common shares                                                                      | 931,244,289          | $  16,089            |                                          |                                                    |\n| Treasury shares -

Under the bail-in regime, there is no fixed and pre-determined contractual conversion ratio for the conversion of the specified eligible shares and liabilities of CIBC that are subject to a bail-in conversion into common shares, nor are there specific requirements regarding whether liabilities subject to a bail-in conversion are converted into common shares of CIBC or any of its affiliates. CDIC determines the timing of the bail-in conversion, the portion of the specified eligible shares and liabilities to be converted and the terms and conditions of the conversion, subject to parameters set out in the bail-in regime. See the 'Regulatory capital and total loss absorbing capacity (TLAC) requirements' section for further details.\n\n## Preferred share and other equity instruments rights and privileges\n\nSee Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for details on our preferred share and other equity instruments rights and privileges.\n\n## Off-balance sheet arrangements\n\nWe enter into off-balance sheet arrangements in the normal course of our business. We consolidate all of our sponsored trusts that securitize our own assets.\n\n## Non-consolidated structured entities (SEs)\n\nWe manage and administer a single-seller conduit and several CIBC-sponsored multi-seller conduits in Canada and the U.S. The multi-seller conduits acquire direct or indirect ownership or security interests in pools of financial assets from our clients and finance the acquisitions by issuing asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP) to investors. The single-seller conduit acquires financial assets and finances these acquisitions through a credit facility provided by a syndicate of financial institutions. The sellers to the conduits may continue to service the assets and may be exposed to credit losses realized on these assets, typically through the provision of over-collateralization or another form of credit enhancement. The conduits may obtain credit enhancement from third-party providers.\n\nWe provide the multi-seller conduits with commercial paper backstop liquidity facilities. We may also provide securities distribution to multi-seller conduits and to both the single and multi-seller conduits accounting, cash management, and operations services. The liquidity facilities for the managed and administered multi-seller conduits require us to provide funding, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions with respect to the conduits, for ABCP not placed with external investors. We may also purchase ABCP issued by the multi-seller conduits for market-making and for voluntary risk retention purposes.\n\nWe are required to maintain certain short-term and/or long-term debt ratings with respect to the liquidity facilities that we provide to the sponsored multi-seller conduits in Canada. If we are downgraded below the level specified under the terms of those facilities, we must provide alternative satisfactory liquidity arrangements, such as procuring an alternative liquidity provider that meets the minimum rating requirements.\n\nWe may also act as the counterparty to derivative contracts entered into by a multi-seller conduit in order to convert the yield of the underlying assets to match the needs of the multi-seller conduit's investors or to mitigate the interest rate, basis, and currency risk within the conduit.\n\nWe earn fees for providing services related to the non-consolidated single-seller and multi-seller conduits, such as backstop liquidity facilities, distribution, transaction structuring, and conduit administration. These fees totalled $86 million in 2023 (2022: $70 million). All fees earned in respect of activities with the conduits are on a market basis.\n\nAs at October 31, 2023, the amount of ABCP issued to fund the various asset types in the multi-seller conduits was $13.3 billion (2022: $9.3 billion). The estimated weighted-average life of these assets was 1.6 years (2022: 1.8 years). Our holdings of commercial paper issued by the non-consolidated sponsored multi-seller conduits that offer commercial paper to external investors were $414 million (2022: $642 million). Our committed backstop liquidity facilities to these conduits were $17.8 billion (2022: $11.7 billion). We also provided credit facilities of $50 million (2022: $50 million) to these conduits.\n\nWe participated in a syndicated facility of $700 million to the single-seller conduit that provides funding to franchisees of a major Canadian retailer, which will mature in April 2025. Our portion of the commitment was $130 million (2022: $130 million), of which $91 million (2022: $98 million) was funded as at October 31, 2023.\n\nWe engage one or more of the four major rating agencies, DBRS Limited (DBRS), Fitch Ratings Inc. (Fitch), Moody's Investors Service, Inc. (Moody's), and S&P, to opine on the credit ratings of ABCP issued by our sponsored multi-seller conduits. In the event that ratings differ between rating agencies in respect of any direct investments we have in the ABCP or transactions funded in the ABCP conduits, we use the lower rating.\n\nWe also have investments in and provide loans, liquidity and credit facilities to certain other third-party and CIBC-managed SEs. The on-balance sheet exposure related to these SEs is included in the consolidated financial statements.\n\nWe provide interim and term senior financing to third-party SEs for the purpose of purchasing loans during the warehousing phase for future securitization. As senior lenders we are repaid by proceeds from the issuance of debt securities to external investors when the securitization closes or by the cash flows from the repayment of the underlying assets held by the SE or alternative financing obtained by the SE from third-party lenders.",

We do not guarantee either principal or returns to investors in these funds. We act as a trustee of a number of personal trusts and have a fiduciary responsibility to act in the best interests of the beneficiaries of the trusts. We earn a fee for acting as a trustee. We also participate in transactions to modify the cash flows of trusts managed by third-party asset managers to create investments with specific risk profiles, or to assist clients in the efficient management of other risks. Typically, these involve the use of derivative products, which transfer the risks and returns to or from a trust.\n\n## Derivatives\n\nWe participate in derivatives transactions, as a market maker facilitating the needs of our clients or as a principal to manage the risks associated with our funding, investing and trading strategies. All derivatives are recorded at fair value on our consolidated balance sheet. See Notes 12 and 23 to the consolidated financial statements for details on derivative contracts and the risks associated with them.\n\n## Credit-related arrangements\n\nCredit-related arrangements are generally off-balance sheet instruments and are typically entered into to meet the financing needs of clients. In addition, there are certain exposures for which we could be obligated to extend credit that are not recorded on the consolidated balance sheet. For additional details of these arrangements, see the 'Liquidity risk' section and Note 21 to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Guarantees\n\nA guarantee is a contract that requires the issuer to make specified payments to reimburse the holder for a loss it incurs because a specified debtor failed to make payment when due in accordance with the original or modified terms of a debt instrument. Guarantees include credit derivatives protection sold and standby and performance letters of credit, as discussed in Notes 12 and 21 to the consolidated financial statements, respectively.",

Identifying and understanding risks and their impact allows CIBC to frame its risk appetite and risk management practices. Defining acceptable levels of risk, and establishing sound principles, policies and practices for managing risks, is fundamental to achieving consistent and sustainable long-term performance, while remaining within our risk appetite.\n\nOur risk appetite defines tolerance levels for various risks. This is the foundation for our risk management culture and our risk management framework.\n\nOur risk management framework includes:\n\n- \u0081 CIBC, SBU, functional group-level and regional risk appetite statements;\n- \u0081 Risk frameworks, policies, procedures and limits to align activities with our risk appetite;\n- \u0081 Regular risk reports to identify and communicate risk levels;\n- \u0081 An independent control framework to identify and test the design and operating effectiveness of our key controls;\n- \u0081 Stress testing to consider the potential impact of changes in the business environment on capital, liquidity and earnings;\n- \u0081 Proactive consideration of risk mitigation options in order to optimize results; and\n- \u0081 Oversight through our risk-focused committees and governance structure.\n\nManaging risk is a shared responsibility at CIBC. Business units and risk management professionals work in collaboration to ensure that business strategies and activities are consistent with our risk appetite. CIBC's approach to enterprise-wide risk management aligns with the three lines of defence model:\n\n(i)\n\nAs the first line of defence, CIBC's Management, in SBUs and functional groups own the risks and are accountable and responsible for\n\nidentifying and assessing risks inherent in its activities in accordance with the CIBC risk appetite. In addition, Management establishes and\n\nmaintains controls to mitigate such risks. Management may include governance groups within the business to facilitate the Control\n\nFramework and other risk-related processes. A Governance Group refers to a group within Business Unit Management (first line of defence)\n\nwhose focus is to manage governance, risk and control activities on behalf of that Business Unit Management. A Governance Group is\n\nconsidered first line of defence, in conjunction with Business Unit Management. Control Groups are groups with enterprise-wide\n\naccountability for specific risk types and are also considered first line of defence. They provide subject matter expertise to Management\n\nand/or implement/maintain enterprise-wide control programs and activities for their domain area (for example Information Security). While\n\nControl Groups collaborate with Management in identifying and managing risk, they also challenge risk decisions and risk mitigation\n\nstrategies.\n\n- (ii) The second line of defence is independent from the first line of defence and provides an enterprise-wide view of specific risk types, guidance and effective challenge to risk and control activities. Risk Management is the primary second line of defence. Risk Management may leverage subject matter expertise of other groups (e.g., third parties or Control Groups) to inform their independent assessments, as appropriate.\n- (iii) As the third line of defence, CIBC's Internal Audit is responsible for providing reasonable assurance to senior management and the Audit Committee of the Board on the effectiveness of CIBC's governance practices, risk management processes, and Internal Control as a part of its risk-based audit plan and in accordance with its mandate as described in the Internal Audit Charter.\n\nA strong risk culture and communication between the three lines of defence are important characteristics of effective risk management.\n\n- 60 Risk measurement\n- 63 Exposure to credit risk\n- 65 Credit quality of portfolios\n- 68 Credit quality performance\n- 69 Loans contractually past due but not impaired\n- 69 Exposure to certain countries and regions\n- 69 U.S. office real estate exposure\n- 69 Settlement risk\n- 70 Securitization activities\n\n## 71 Market risk\n\n- 71 Governance and management\n- 71 Policies\n- 71 Market risk limits\n- 71 Process and control\n- 71 Risk measurement",

Our guiding principle is to practice sound risk management, supported by strong capital and funding positions, as we pursue our client-focused strategy. In defining our risk appetite, we take into consideration our purpose, vision, values, strategy and objectives, along with our risk capacity (defined by regulatory constraints). It defines how we conduct business, which is to be consistent with the following objectives:\n\n- \u0081 Safeguarding our reputation and brand;\n- \u0081 Doing the right thing for our clients/stakeholders;\n- \u0081 Engaging in client-oriented businesses after understanding the potential risks and rewards;\n- \u0081 Make our client's goals our own in a professional and radically simple manner;\n- \u0081 Managing a balance between risk and returns;\n- \u0081 Retaining a prudent attitude towards tail and event risk;\n- \u0081 Meeting regulatory expectations and/or identifying and having plans in place to address any issues in a timely manner;\n- \u0081 Achieving/maintaining an AA rating; and\n- \u0081 Meeting/exceeding stakeholders' expectations with respect to the ESG criteria including setting/sharing targets, and reporting progress towards these targets.\n\nOur risk appetite statement contains metrics with limits that define our risk tolerance levels. In addition, we have SBU, functional group and regional risk appetite statements that are integrated with our overall risk appetite statement that further articulate our business level risk tolerances.\n\nOur risk appetite statement is reviewed annually in conjunction with our strategic, financial and capital planning cycle to ensure alignment and is approved annually by the Board. To help drive strong oversight and governance around our risk appetite, the Board, RMC and senior management regularly receive and review reporting on our risk profile against the risk appetite limits.\n\nAll strategic business decisions, as well as day-to-day business decisions, are governed by our risk appetite framework. Strategic decisions are evaluated to ensure that the risk exposure is within our risk appetite. Day-to-day activities and decisions are governed by our framework of risk tolerance limits, policies, standards and procedures that support our risk appetite statement.",

At CIBC, we strive to achieve a consistent and effective risk culture by:\n\n- \u0081 Promoting, through both formal and informal channels, a shared accountability of risk identification, management and mitigation;\n- \u0081 Cultivating an environment of transparency, open communication and robust discussion of risk;\n- \u0081 Setting the appropriate 'tone at the top' through clear communication and reinforcement; and\n- \u0081 Identifying and reinforcing behaviours that are aligned with risk appetite, and escalating misaligned behaviours.\n\nEvery year, all employees are required to complete formal training on risk appetite, reputation risk, operational risk, code of conduct, AML and other key risk topics. By taking this mandatory training, all employees strengthen their basic knowledge of risk management in support of our risk culture. This training is supplemented by our risk appetite statement, risk management priorities and documents on our internal website. In addition, we have policies, procedures and limits in place that govern our day-to-day business activity, with escalation procedures for limit breaches outlined accordingly.\n\n## Risk input into performance and compensation\n\nThroughout the year, the Risk Management team manages various compensation risk reviews. These reviews are part of the second line of defence responsibilities to review and challenge new compensation plans, changes to existing compensation plans and compensation plan closure. In addition, periodic risk reviews are completed to ensure all compensation plans are risk assessed on a regular basis. All compensation plans are rated as either high-risk or low-risk with high-risk compensation plans requiring approval from the CRO.\n\nAt each year-end, Risk Management provides an assessment of adherence to risk appetite and material risk matters across CIBC. Risk Management also considers a number of risk inputs to identify matters that may directly impact incentive pools and/or individual compensation awards and/or performance ratings. Annually, Risk Management reviews the assessment with both the RMC and the MRCC.\n\nThe MRCC oversees the performance management and compensation process and is responsible for assisting the Board of Directors in their global oversight of CIBC's human capital strategy, including talent and total rewards, and the alignment with CIBC's strategy, risk appetite and controls. The MRCC's oversight of human capital strategy includes inclusion at work, employee health, safety and wellbeing and other ESG practices related to their mandate. The MRCC's key compensation-related responsibilities include:\n\n- \u0081 Reviewing and recommending for Board approval annual compensation, including changes to compensation targets, if any, for the CEO, ExCo members, and Other Key Officers;\n- \u0081 Approving annual compensation for any employee whose total direct compensation exceeds the materiality threshold determined by the Committee;\n- \u0081 Assessing the appropriateness of compensation based on business performance and risks undertaken;\n- \u0081 Reviewing and recommending for Board approval the aggregate annual incentive compensation and allocations to the SBUs and the functional groups;\n- \u0081 Approving CIBC's compensation philosophy and any material changes to CIBC's compensation principles or practices;\n- \u0081 Reviewing material compensation policies and approving any material changes to such policies or any new material compensation policies;\n- \u0081 Reviewing and recommending Board approval of new material compensation plans and changes to existing material compensation plans; and\n- \u0081 Reviewing a report on non-material plans.",

Risk identification is a continuous process, generally achieved through:\n\n- \u0081 Regular assessment of risks associated with lending and trading credit exposures;\n- \u0081 Ongoing monitoring of trading and non-trading portfolios;\n- \u0081 Assessment of risks in new business activities and processes;\n- \u0081 Assessment of risks in complex and unusual business transactions;\n- \u0081 Regular monitoring of the overall risk profile considering market developments and trends, and external and internal events; and\n- \u0081 Ongoing monitoring of management operations and processes.\n\nRisk Management maintains a 'Risk Register' to list all material risks facing CIBC. The inventory is based on the risks inherent in our businesses and updated through various processes, illustrated in the following chart, to reflect changes in the nature of the risks we are facing. The Risk Register is used to support our ICAAP, either explicitly in the economic and regulatory capital calculations, or implicitly through the buffer of actual capital over economic capital and regulatory capital.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe decision to register a new risk is based on its risk assessment through our risk identification processes and includes criteria such as severity, measurability and probability. Furthermore, the decision on the amount of capital allocated to cover the new risk brought on the books will take into consideration the effectiveness and impact of the risk mitigants available.\n\nWe have enterprise-wide methodologies, models and techniques in place to measure both the quantitative and qualitative aspects of risks, appropriate for the various types of risks we face. These methodologies, models and techniques are subject to independent assessment and review to ensure that the underlying logic remains sound, that model risks have been identified and managed, that use of the models continues to be appropriate and outputs are valid.\n\nRisk is usually measured in terms of expected loss, unexpected loss, and economic capital.\n\n## Expected loss\n\nExpected loss represents the loss that is statistically expected to occur in the normal course of business, with adjustments for conservatism, in a given period of time.\n\nIn respect of credit risk, the parameters used to measure expected loss are PD, LGD and EAD. These parameters are updated regularly and are based either on our historical experience through the cycle and benchmarking of credit exposures or as prescribed by our regulators as applicable. Unlike the PD, LGD and EAD parameters used for calculating ECL on our consolidated financial statements, the PD, LGD and EAD parameters used for regulatory capital purposes are not adjusted for forward-looking information.\n\nFor trading market risks, VaR is a statistical technique used to measure risk. VaR is an estimate of the loss in market value for a given level of confidence that we would expect to incur in our trading portfolio due to an adverse one-day movement in market rates, implied volatility and prices using the most recent 500 trading days. We also use stressed VaR to estimate an expected loss over a 10 day holding period and using a one-year historical window when relevant market factors were in distress.\n\nFor trading credit risks associated with market value based products, we use models to estimate exposure relative to the value of the portfolio of trades with each counterparty, giving consideration to market rates and prices.\n\n## Unexpected loss and economic capital\n\nUnexpected loss is the statistical estimate of the amount by which actual losses might exceed expected losses over a specified time horizon, computed at a given confidence level. We use economic capital to estimate the level of capital needed to protect us against unexpected losses.\n\nWe also use techniques such as sensitivity analysis and stress testing to help ensure that the risks remain within our risk appetite and that our capital is adequate to cover those risks. Our stress testing program includes evaluation of the potential effects of various economic and market scenarios on our risk profile, earnings and capital. Refer to the 'Capital management' section for additional details.",

        "page_content": "## Management's discussion and analysis\n\n## Model risk management\n\nModel risk management encompasses sound development, independent validation, and ongoing monitoring and review of the models as well as governance and controls that are proportionate to the risks. Our model inventory includes, but is not limited to, models that relate to risk measurement (including VaR, economic and regulatory capital), pricing, mark-to-market (MTM), credit risk rating and scoring models, credit models for the calculation of loss severity and stress testing, and models for the calculation of ECL under IFRS 9. CIBC's approach to provide effective governance and oversight for model risk management comprises the following key elements:\n\n- \u0081 Governance and oversight by management committees, including the Model and Parameter Risk Committee (MPRC), senior management and the Board;\n- \u0081 Policies, procedures and standards to outline applicable roles and responsibilities of the various oversight groups and to provide guidance to identify, measure, control and monitor model risk throughout the model's life cycle; and\n- \u0081 Controls for key operational aspects of model risk management including maintaining a model inventory, model risk ranking, model risk attestation and ongoing monitoring and reporting.\n\nThe MPRC is a subcommittee of the Operational Risk and Control Committee (ORCC) and is responsible for reviewing and approving proposals for new and/or modified regulatory, economic capital and IFRS 9 models and provides oversight of CIBC's regulatory, economic capital and IFRS 9 models and parameters for credit, market and operational risks. The MPRC has accountability and responsibility for model and parameter approvals, parameter performance monitoring, validation oversight, and policy oversight.\n\n## Model risk mitigation policies\n\nWe have policies, procedures, standards and controls to ensure effective model risk management for CIBC. A model review and validation is the independent effective challenge that documents the model risk and ensures models are sound and we can rely on their output. The model review and validation process includes:\n\n- \u0081 Review of model documentation;\n- \u0081 Comprehensive, systematic testing of key model parameters on implementation to ensure results are as expected;\n- \u0081 Replication of the risk quantification process to determine whether the model implementation is faithful to the model specifications;\n- \u0081 Review of whether the model/parameter concepts and assumptions are appropriate and robust;\n- \u0081 Accuracy testing to assess the calibration and accuracy of the risk components including, for example, the discriminative power of rating systems and the reasonableness of capital parameters;\n- \u0081 Sensitivity testing to analyze the sensitivity of model/parameter outputs to model/parameter assumptions and key inputs;\n- \u0081 Scenario and stress testing of the model outputs to key inputs;\n- \u0081 Back-testing by comparing actual results with model-generated risk measures;\n- \u0081 Benchmarking to other models and comparable internal and external data;\n- \u0081 Review of the internal usage of the model/parameter applications to ensure consistency of application;\n- \u0081 Reporting of model status to the MPRC, supported through an up-to-date inventory of regulatory models and parameters;\n- \u0081 A quarterly attestation process for model owners in order to ensure compliance with the Model Risk and Validation Policy; and\n- \u0081 A comprehensive validation report that identifies the conditions for valid application of the model and summarizes these findings to the model owners, developers and users.\n\nOnce a model has been approved for use, ongoing monitoring becomes a joint responsibility of model users, owners and validators.\n\n## Stress testing\n\nStress testing supplements our other risk management tools by providing an estimate of the potential impacts of plausible but stressed economic scenarios and risk factors. Results of stress testing are interpreted in the context of our risk appetite, including metrics for capital adequacy. Enterprise-wide stress testing, capital planning and financial planning processes are integrated for a comprehensive information system. See the 'Capital management' section for detailed discussion on our enterprise-wide stress testing.\n\n## Risk treatment and mitigation\n\nRisk treatment and mitigation is the implementation of options for modifying risk levels. We pursue risk mitigation options in order to control our risk profile in the context of our risk appetite. Our objective is to proactively consider risk mitigation options in order to optimize results.\n\nDiscussions regarding potential risk mitigation strategies are held between Risk Management and the lines of business, at the GRC or GALCO and at the RMC for governance and oversight, as appropriate. In evaluating possible strategies, considerations include costs and benefits, residual risks (i.e., risks that are retained), secondary risks (i.e., those caused by the risk mitigation actions), and appropriate monitoring and review to track results.\n\n## Risk controls\n\nOur risk management framework also includes a comprehensive set of risk controls, designed to ensure that risks are being appropriately identified and managed. Our risk controls are part of CIBC's overall Control Framework, developed based on the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission's (COSO) widely accepted 'Internal Control - Integrated Framework'. The Control Framework also draws on elements of the OSFI Supervisory Framework and Corporate Governance Guidelines.\n\nThe Board, primarily through the RMC, approves certain credit risk limits and delegates specific transactional approval authorities to the CEO or jointly to the CEO and CRO. The RMC must approve transactions that exceed delegated authorities. Delegation of authority to business units is controlled to ensure decision-making authorities are restricted to those individuals with the necessary experience levels. In addition, CIBC has rigorous processes to identify, evaluate and remediate risk control deficiencies in a timely manner. Regular reporting is provided to the RMC to evidence compliance with risk limits. Risk limits and the delegation of authority to the CEO or jointly to the CEO and CRO are reviewed annually by the RMC.\n\n## Risk monitoring and reporting\n\nTo monitor CIBC's risk profile and facilitate evaluation against the risk appetite statement, a number of measurement metrics have been established, with regular reporting against these metrics provided to the GRC and the RMC. This reporting enables decisions on growth and risk mitigation strategies.\n\nExposures are also regularly monitored against limits, with escalation protocols for limit excesses, should they occur. Escalation protocols ensure awareness at appropriate levels and facilitate management of excesses that is consistent with our risk appetite.\n\nRegular management reports on each risk type are also prepared to facilitate monitoring and control of risk at a more granular level.",

        "page_content": "## Management's discussion and analysis\n\n## Top and emerging risks\n\nWe monitor and review top and emerging risks that may affect our future results, and take action to mitigate potential risks. We perform in-depth analyses, which may include stress testing our exposures relative to the risks, and we provide updates and related developments to the Board on a regular basis. Top and emerging risks are those that we consider to have potential negative implications that are material for CIBC. This section describes those top and emerging risks, as well as regulatory and accounting developments that are material for CIBC.\n\n## Inflation, interest rates and economic growth\n\nHigh inflation continued to drive tightening in monetary policies by major central banks in 2023, posing risks to the economic growth ahead. The rapid increase in interest rates is putting pressure on credit risks globally. U.S. regional bank failures put pressure on liquidity and funding conditions for the financial industry, while tightening credit for U.S. small and medium sized businesses. Commercial office real estate, particularly in the U.S., is facing challenges due to post-pandemic hybrid work arrangements and high interest rates, negatively impacting office asset valuations. Further details on the U.S. office real estate exposure are provided in the 'Credit risk - U.S. office real estate exposure' section. The impact of higher interest rates on Canadian mortgages is discussed under the 'Canadian consumer debt and the housing market' section below and in the 'Credit risk - Real estate secured personal lending' section. We are closely monitoring the macroeconomic environment and assessing its potential adverse impact on our clients, counterparties and businesses. Further details on the macroeconomic environment are provided in the 'Economic and market environment - Outlook for calendar year 2024' section.\n\n## Canadian consumer debt and the housing market\n\nOSFI's Guideline B-20 was introduced in 2012, with a subsequent update effective January 2018, to provide its expectations for strong residential mortgage underwriting for federally regulated lenders. The revised guideline had its intended effect as debt-to-income ratios flattened in 2018-2019. Following the initial impact of COVID-19, the housing market rebounded strongly in 2021-2022, with rapid price growth, increasing the risk that new borrowers may be unable to repay loan obligations due to higher mortgage indebtedness levels.\n\nIn recent quarters, higher interest rates caused some correction to housing prices and put pressure on debt serviceability. While the mortgage debt service ratio increased, driven by higher interest payments, this has been partially offset by historic low levels of non-mortgage debt, softening household spending, and continued strong wage growth.\n\nGiven the rapid increase in housing price levels and re-ignited concerns around household indebtedness in 2021-2022, OSFI took proactive actions in assessing lenders' practices under the existing market conditions. In June 2021, we started to qualify uninsured and insured mortgages at the higher of the mortgage contract rate plus 2%, or 5.25% and, in June 2022, OSFI released a new advisory and clarifications on the treatment of innovative real estate secured lending products under Guideline B-20. OSFI's public consultation for B-20 to propose complementary debt serviceability measures to control high consumer indebtedness (i.e., loan-to-income and debt-to-income restrictions) closed in April 2023.\n\nThe Capital Adequacy Requirements (CAR) and Mortgage Insurer Capital Adequacy Test (MICAT) guidelines have been updated effective November 1, 2023. These changes will result in an increase in RWA for mortgages that have been in negative-amortization for three consecutive months with LTV over 65%. CIBC is implementing these changes effective November 1. CIBC continues to monitor the impact of macroeconomic factors to our clients through stress tests and scenario/sensitivity analyses. Additionally, CIBC is also closely monitoring our mortgage clients who have or will soon renew for signs of financial stress in the current high rate environment.\n\nSee the 'Real estate secured personal lending' section for the guidance issued by OSFI in June 2022 on the Clarification on the Treatment of Innovative Real Estate Secured Lending Products under Guideline B-20.\n\n## Geopolitical risk\n\nThe level of geopolitical risk escalates at certain points in time. While the specific impact on the global economy and on global credit and capital markets would depend on the nature of the event, in general, any major event could result in instability and volatility, leading to widening spreads, declining equity valuations, flight to safe-haven currencies and increased purchases of gold. In the short run, market disruption could hurt the net income of our trading and non-trading market risk positions. Geopolitical risk could reduce economic growth, and in combination with the potential impacts on commodity prices and the recent rise of protectionism, could have serious negative implications for general economic and banking activities. Current areas of concern include:\n\n- \u0081 The war in Ukraine;\n- \u0081 Conflict in the Middle East;\n- \u0081 Ongoing U.S., Canada and China relations and trade issues;\n- \u0081 Rising civil unrest and activism globally; and\n- \u0081 Relations between the U.S. and Iran.\n\nWhile it is impossible to predict where new geopolitical disruption will occur, we do pay particular attention to markets and regions with existing or recent historical instability to assess the impact of these environments on the markets and businesses in which we operate.\n\n## Climate risk\n\nThe physical effects of climate change along with regulations designed to mitigate its negative impacts will have a measurable impact on communities and the economy. The physical risks of climate change resulting from severe weather events and systemic issues such as rising sea levels can impact CIBC's profitability through disruptions in our own operations and damage to critical infrastructure. Transition risks, which arise as society adjusts towards a low-carbon future, can impact the financial health of our clients as changes in policy, regulation and technology aimed at limiting global warming can increase their operating costs and reduce profitability, while translating into potentially higher credit losses for the bank. We are also exposed to legal and reputational risks due to changing stakeholder expectations related to action or inaction in addressing climate-related risks. As the world transitions to a low-carbon economy, we are committed to understanding and responsibly managing the relevant impacts of climate change on our operations and our business activities. In support of this commitment, we have established our ambition to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions associated with operational and financing activities by 2050, including interim targets to reduce the carbon intensity of our financed emissions in the oil and gas and power generation sectors by 2030. This builds on our environmental leadership and enhances our ability to continue creating long-term shareholder value as the landscape of climate-related risks and opportunities evolves.\n\nSetting net-zero targets across a complex set of financing activities is an emerging practice and our methodology is informed by international standards and current industry best practices. We continue to work to accelerate our climate aspirations by embedding net-zero considerations through our business practices and financing activities.",

        "page_content": "There is an increasing demand for disclosure around climate-related risk identification and mitigation. We support the Task Force on Climaterelated Financial Disclosure's (TCFD's) recommendations for globally consistent and comparable climate disclosure and published our third standalone report in March 2023, which presents information about CIBC's efforts towards aligning our climate disclosure with the TCFD framework.\n\nIn the past year, a number of regulators and standard-setting organizations introduced disclosure frameworks related to climate change risks, as well as environmental and social risks. Key among them is the IFRS Foundation's International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB), which in June 2023 issued its inaugural standards IFRS S1 'General Requirements for Disclosure of Sustainability-related Financial Information' (IFRS S1) and IFRS S2 'Climate-related Disclosures' (IFRS S2). Both standards are designed to enable companies to communicate sustainability-related risks and opportunities to investors over the short, medium and long term. IFRS S1 addresses the content and presentation requirements for sustainability disclosures more broadly, whereas IFRS S2 focuses specifically on climate-related disclosure. Based on the transition rules set out in the standards, they will apply to CIBC for our reporting period ended October 31, 2025 to the extent they become effective in Canada. In addition, regulators such as the SEC, OSFI and the Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA) have released proposed or final requirements for climate risk disclosures including defining guidance and expectations related to climate risk management practices and metrics to measure this risk. In March 2023, OSFI released Guideline B-15 on Climate Risk Management, which will be initially effective for us for our reporting period ended October 31, 2024, with the disclosures required to be made publicly available within 180 days of our fiscal year-end. OSFI's principles-based expectations set out in this guideline focus on understanding and mitigating the impact of climate-related risks to business models and strategy, governance and risk management practices used to manage climate-related risks, and remaining financially and operationally resilient through severe climate scenarios. OSFI is expected to review Guideline B-15 as practices evolve, including considering updates based on the disclosure requirements in the ISSB standards. We have established an enterprise-wide working group to assess the impacts of Guideline B-15 and support its implementation. In July 2023, the European Commission adopted the European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS) for use by entities subject to the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD). The ESRS will require disclosure on climate change and other material environmental, social and governance matters.\n\nPotential divergence among the regulators in disclosure expectations, coupled with the pace at which the regulatory landscape changes, pose operational risks to us. We continue to monitor these developments and evolve our approach to support future regulatory requirements. See the 'Environmental and social risk' section for additional information.\n\n## Technology, information and cyber security risk\n\nFinancial institutions like CIBC are evolving their use of technology and business processes to improve the client experience and streamline operations. At the same time, cyber threats and the associated financial, reputational and business interruption risks have also increased. We continue to actively manage these risks through strategic risk reviews, enterprise-wide technology and information security programs, with the goal of maintaining overall cyber-resilience that prevents, detects, and responds to threats such as data breaches, malware, unauthorized access, and denial-of-service attacks, which can result in damage to CIBC systems and information, theft or disclosure of confidential information, unauthorized or fraudulent activity, and service disruption at CIBC or its service providers, including those that offer cloud services.\n\nGiven the importance of electronic financial systems, including secure online and mobile banking provided by CIBC to its clients, CIBC monitors the changing environment globally, including cyber threats, mitigation strategies and evolving regulatory requirements, in order to improve our controls and processes to protect our systems and client information. In addition, we perform cyber security preparedness, testing, and recovery exercises to validate our defences, benchmark against best practices and provide regular updates to the Board. We have well-defined cyber incident response protocols and playbooks in the event that a security incident or breach occurs. We also have cyber insurance coverage to help mitigate against certain potential losses associated with cyber incidents. Our insurance coverage is subject to various terms and provisions, including limits on the types and amounts of coverage relating to losses arising from cyber incidents. We periodically assess our insurance coverage based on our risk tolerance and limits. Despite our commitment to information and cyber security, and given the rapidly evolving threat and regulatory landscape, coupled with a changing business environment, it is not possible for us to identify all cyber risks or implement measures to prevent or eliminate all potential cyber incidents from occurring. However, we monitor our risk profile for changes and continue to refine approaches to security protection and service resilience to minimize the impact of any cyber incidents that may occur.\n\n## Commodity prices\n\nAfter showing strength in the third quarter, most commodities saw prices decline in the fourth quarter of 2023, with the one exception being oil. Crude oil prices continued to climb as further OPEC production cuts and storage concerns lead the fundamental analysis. Natural gas prices decreased throughout August and September as concerns over winter natural gas supply seemed to be alleviated; production remained high and demand was stable. Gold prices also fell, due to stronger U.S. dollar and 'higher for longer' rates. Grain prices have stabilized following the initial volatility when Russia withdrew from the Ukrainian grain export deal. CIBC continues to monitor longer-term developments as geopolitical tensions and desire for energy independence face off against decarbonization ambitions in shaping energy policies and trade flows.\n\n## Disintermediation risk\n\nCanadian banking clients are increasingly shifting their service transactions from brick-and-mortar banking centres to digital platforms. Competitive pressure from digital disruptors, both global technology leaders and smaller financial technology entrants, is increasing and the risk of disintermediation continues to grow due to the level of sophistication of these non-traditional competitors, and increased adoption of emerging technologies. The emergence of Decentralized Finance, where fully automated financial applications are programmed into a blockchain network using digital assets, such as cryptocurrencies, is one such technology trend that enables parties to transact without third-party intermediaries such as banks. However, in Canada, the risk of blockchain technology disintermediating banks in the near-term appears low. Currently, Canadians have access to robust financial infrastructure, and while blockchain technology offers a potential approach to address counterparty risk, the value a bank brings to a client relationship extends beyond managing counterparty risk; especially as clients develop more complex financial considerations that require the expertise and empathy of a human-centered approach. Decentralized Finance may evolve in ways that make it more accessible to the public, but without appropriate regulation to address the elevated levels of volatility, fraud, theft, and associated risks, its appeal may remain limited to Canadians with a higher risk tolerance.\n\nWe manage disintermediation risk through strategic reviews as well as investment in emerging channels, in data and analytics capabilities, and in technology and innovation in general, to meet our clients' changing expectations, while working to reduce our cost structure and simplify operations. We maintain a central and coordinated approach to innovation to manage these risks while also benefitting from the opportunities they bring.\n\n## Data and Artificial Intelligence risk\n\nData is being used every day to further advance CIBC's strategic objectives and create competitive advantages. To support this, CIBC continues to invest in our data management and governance capabilities to ensure we have a strong data foundation to support reporting needs, business decisionmaking and grow our analytics practices to use data as a transformative asset. With rapid advances in technology, this includes further applications of",

In addition, transparency in AI models is required to ensure the reasoning, accuracy or appropriateness of the output is clearly understood. CIBC is maturing our AI governance and risk management practices to ensure these risks are well managed as we consider further adoption of AI technologies.\n\n## Third-party risk\n\nThe Board and senior management recognize the establishment of third-party relationships as important to CIBC's business model and therefore leverage them to achieve CIBC's business objectives. With the introduction of new technologies, a more global footprint, and increasing reliance on sub-contractors, the third-party landscape continues to evolve. While such relationships may benefit us through reduced costs, increased innovation, improved performance and increased business competitiveness, they can also introduce risks of failure or disruption to CIBC through breakdowns in people, processes or technology or through external events that impact these third parties.\n\nTo mitigate third-party risks, prepare for future third-party risks and changing regulatory expectations, and to ensure existing processes and internal controls are operating effectively, we rely on our strong risk culture and established the Third Party Risk Management program, which includes policies, procedures, expertise and resources dedicated to third-party risk management. The program identifies and manages risks that arise from third-party relationships from the point of planning through the life cycle of the business arrangement and supports the maintenance of collaborative relationships that advance our strategic direction and operational needs within our risk appetite.\n\n## Anti-money laundering, anti-terrorist financing and sanctions\n\nMoney laundering, terrorist financing activities and other related crimes pose a threat to the stability and integrity of a country's financial sector and its broader economy. In recognition of this threat, the international community has made the fight against these illegal activities a priority. We are committed to adhering to all regulatory requirements pertaining to anti-money laundering (AML), anti-terrorist financing (ATF) and sanctions in the jurisdictions where we operate and implementing best practices to minimize the impact of such activities. In Canada, to improve the effectiveness of the AML/ATF regime, amendments to the regulations under the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act continue to be published, with some provisions coming into force within a short span of time. In accordance with these amendments, we have implemented procedures, processes, and controls with respect to client due diligence, record keeping and reporting as well as mandatory annual AML/ATF and sanctions training for all employees to ensure that relevant regulatory obligations are met in each jurisdiction where we operate. Canada, the U.S., the U.K., and the European Union (EU) continue to expand and adjust economic sanctions on Russia over its war in Ukraine which have continued to evolve since March 2022. We continue to monitor and enhance controls as required, in accordance with our established processes for managing sanctions updates.\n\n## U.S. banking regulation\n\nOur U.S. operations are subject to supervision by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve), and are also subject to a comprehensive federal and state regulatory framework. Our wholly owned subsidiary, CIBC Bancorp USA Inc. (CIBC Bancorp), is a financial holding company subject to regulation and supervision by the Federal Reserve under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended. CIBC Bank USA, our Illinois-chartered bank, is subject to regulation by the U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the Federal Reserve and the Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation. CIBC's New York branch is subject to regulation and supervision by the New York Department of Financial Services and the Federal Reserve. Certain market activities of our U.S. operations are subject to regulation by the SEC and the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission, as well as other oversight bodies.\n\nThe scope of these regulations impact our business in a number of ways. For example, both CIBC Bancorp and CIBC Bank USA are required to maintain minimum capital ratios in accordance with Basel III rules adopted by the U.S. bank regulatory agencies, which differ in some respects from Canada's Basel III rules. Under the U.S. bank regulatory framework, both CIBC and CIBC Bancorp are expected to provide a source of strength to the subsidiary bank and may be required to commit additional capital and other resources to CIBC Bank USA in the event that its financial condition were to deteriorate, whether due to overall challenging economic conditions in the U.S., or because of business-specific issues. The Federal Reserve (in the case of CIBC Bancorp), and the FDIC and the Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation (in the case of CIBC Bank USA) also have the ability to restrict dividends paid by CIBC Bancorp or CIBC Bank USA, which could limit our ability to receive distributions on our capital investment in our U.S. banking operations.\n\nAs our combined U.S. operations grow, we will become subject to additional enhanced prudential standards under the Federal Reserve's regulations applicable to foreign banking organizations. Furthermore, the Federal Reserve and the FDIC may also restrict our U.S. operations, organic or inorganic growth, if, among other things, they have supervisory concerns about risk management, AML or compliance programs and practices, governance and controls, and/or capital and liquidity adequacy at CIBC Bancorp, CIBC Bank USA or our New York branch, as applicable. In some instances, banking regulators may take supervisory actions that may not be publicly disclosed, which may restrict or limit our New York branch and our U.S. subsidiaries from engaging in certain categories of new activities or acquiring shares or control of other companies. Any restrictions imposed by banking regulators could negatively impact us by loss of revenue, limitations on the products or services we offer, and increased operational and compliance costs.\n\nThe U.S. regulatory environment continues to evolve and future legislative and regulatory developments may impact CIBC.\n\n## Interbank Offered Rate transition\n\nInterest rate benchmarks including the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) and other similar European benchmarks have been reformed and replaced by alternative benchmark rates (alternative rates) that meet regulatory definitions. USD LIBOR ceased as at June 30, 2023. In December 2021, the Canadian Alternative Reference Rate working group (CARR) recommended that the Canadian Dollar Offered Rate (CDOR) should cease calculation and publication after June 2024 with CORRA suggested as the replacement benchmark rate. On May 16, 2022, the CDOR administrator announced the cessation of CDOR consistent with the recommendations outlined by CARR. Additionally, on January 11, 2023, CARR announced the development of a Term CORRA rate. See the 'Other regulatory developments' section and Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for further details.\n\n## Tax reform\n\nChanges in tax laws, tax policy, and tax interpretations by tax authorities and the courts are occurring in Canada, the U.S., and other countries around the world. This has led to increased complexity in tax law interpretation, as well as tax increases and expanded tax-related reporting. For example, more than 135 member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), G20 Inclusive Framework on Erosion and Profit Shifting have joined a Two-Pillar plan for international tax reform. Pillar One focuses on the taxation of digital services and Pillar Two establishes a",

The ability to successfully execute on our strategy to integrate acquisitions, and the ability to anticipate and manage risks associated with such corporate transactions are subject to various factors such as receiving regulatory and shareholder approval on a timely basis and on favourable terms, retaining clients and key personnel, realizing synergies and efficiencies, controlling integration and acquisition costs, and changes in general business and economic conditions, among others.\n\nAlthough many of the factors are beyond our control, their impact is partially mitigated by conducting due diligence before completing the transaction and developing and executing appropriate plans. However, given the inherent uncertainty involved in such corporate transactions, we cannot anticipate all potential events, facts and circumstances that may arise and there could be an adverse impact on our operations and financial performance as a result of such corporate transactions.\n\n## Regulatory developments\n\nSee the 'Taxes', 'Capital management', 'Credit risk', 'Liquidity risk' and 'Accounting and control matters' sections for additional information on regulatory developments.\n\n## Accounting developments\n\nSee the 'Accounting and control matters' section and Note 31 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on accounting developments.\n\n## Risks arising from business activities\n\nThe chart below shows our business activities and related risk measures based upon regulatory RWA and average allocated common equity as at October 31, 2023:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- (1)  Average balances are calculated as a weighted average of daily closing balances.\n- (2)  As part of the adoption of the Basel III reforms, a revised approach for allocating operational risk RWA to each of the SBUs was introduced effective April 30, 2023.

        "page_content": "## Credit risk\n\nCredit risk is the risk of financial loss due to a borrower or counterparty failing to meet its obligations in accordance with contractual terms. Credit risk arises out of the lending businesses in each of our SBUs and in International banking, which is included in Corporate and Other. Other sources of credit risk consist of our trading activities, which include our OTC derivatives, debt securities, and our repo-style transaction activity. In addition to losses on the default of a borrower or counterparty, unrealized gains or losses may occur due to changes in the credit spread of the counterparty, which could impact the carrying or fair value of our assets.\n\n## Governance and management\n\nCredit risk is managed through the three lines of defence model. The first line of defence consists of the frontline businesses and governance groups that assess and manage the risks associated with their activities. They own the risks and the controls that mitigate the risks.\n\nThe second line of defence is Risk Management, which provides to an independent risk perspective, strategic direction and leadership to ensure alignment of practices with CIBC's risk appetite. This includes being responsible for certain credit decisions and oversight of credit risks associated with CIBC's personal, small business, commercial, corporate and wealth management activities.\n\nInternal audit is the third line of defence, providing reasonable assurance to senior management and the Audit Committee of the Board on the effectiveness of CIBC's governance practices, risk management processes, and internal control as part of its risk-based audit plan and in accordance with its mandate as described in the Internal Audit Charter.\n\nSenior management reports to the GRC and RMC at least quarterly on material credit risk matters, including material credit transactions, compliance with limits, portfolio trends, impaired loans and credit loss provisioning levels. Provision for (reversal of) credit losses is reviewed by the RMC and the Audit Committee quarterly.\n\nSpecific to the management of credit risk, Risk Management is mandated to provide enterprise-wide oversight of the management of credit risk in CIBC's credit portfolios, including the measurement, monitoring and control of credit risk and the management of credit risk models. Key groups in Risk Management with credit risk responsibility include:\n\nCapital Markets Risk Management: This group is responsible for independent oversight of the measurement, monitoring and control of traded and non-traded market risk, liquidity risk and trading credit risk, including adjudication of trading credit facilities for banks, non-bank financial entities, prime brokerage clients and central clearing counterparties. In addition, Capital Markets Risk Management is responsible for the risk management of sovereign and country risk, securitizations and the oversight of the Global Collateral Finance framework covering repos and securities lending.\n\nGlobal Credit Risk Management: This group is responsible for the adjudication and oversight of credit risks associated with our commercial, corporate, small business and wealth management credit portfolios, management of the risks in our investment portfolios, as well as management of special loan portfolios.\n\nGlobal Operational and Enterprise Risk Management: This group includes the following teams:\n\n- \u0081 Model Validation: responsible for the oversight of model validation practices. Model validation constitutes the independent set of processes, activities and ongoing documentary evidence that models and parameters are sound and CIBC can rely on their output.\n- \u0081 Model Quantification: responsible for the design, development and continuous improvement to risk rating methodologies and credit models that support credit adjudication and expected credit losses, across corporate commercial, personal and business lending segments.\n- \u0081 Enterprise Risk Management is responsible for enterprise-wide reporting and analysis, including enterprise-wide stress testing, expected credit losses, risk data systems and economic capital.\n- \u0081 Risk Regulatory Initiatives is responsible for oversight, governance and delivery of regulatory and strategic initiatives and large enterprise-wide regulatory initiatives.\n- \u0081 Environmental Risk Management has responsibility for developing the environmental strategy, setting environmental performance standards and targets, and reporting on performance for material indicators.\n\nRisk Analytics and Credit Decisioning: This group manages credit risk in personal products offered through the various distribution channels (e.g., residential mortgages, credit cards, personal loans/lines of credit and indirect auto lending) and performs analytics to optimize retail credit performance, along with collections and AML outcomes.\n\nU.S. Risk Management: This group carries out the mandate of CIBC Risk Management at a regional level and provides independent oversight of the identification, management, measurement, monitoring and control of credit risks in the U.S. Commercial Banking and Wealth Management SBU.\n\nAdjudication and oversight above delegated levels is provided by the CRO, GRC and RMC.\n\n## Policies\n\nTo control credit risk, prudent credit risk management principles are used as a base to establish policies, standards and guidelines that govern credit activities as outlined by the credit risk management policy.\n\nThe credit risk management policy supplements CIBC's risk management framework and risk appetite framework, and together with CIBC's portfolio concentration limits for credit exposures, CIBC's common risk/concentration risk limits for credit exposures, and other supporting credit risk policies, standards and procedures, assists CIBC in achieving its desired risk profile by providing an effective foundation for the management of credit risk.\n\n## Credit risk limits\n\nThe RMC approves Board limits, and exposures above Board limits require reporting to, or approval of, the RMC. Management limits are approved by the CRO. Usage is monitored to ensure risks are within allocated management and Board limits. Exposures above management limits require the approval of the CRO. Business lines may also impose lower limits to reflect the nature of their exposures and target markets. This tiering of limits provides for an appropriate hierarchy of decision making and reporting between management and the RMC. Credit approval authority flows from the Board and is further cascaded to officers in writing. The Board's Investment and Lending Authority Resolution sets thresholds above which credit exposures require reporting to, or approval of, the RMC, ensuring an increasing level of oversight for credit exposures of higher risk. CIBC maintains country limits to control exposures within countries outside of Canada and the U.S.",

        "page_content": "## Credit concentration limits\n\nAt a bank-wide level, credit exposures are managed to promote alignment to our risk appetite statement, to maintain the target business mix and to ensure that there is no undue concentration of risk. We set limits to control borrower concentrations by risk-rating band for large exposures (i.e., risk-rated credits). Direct loan sales, credit derivative hedges, or structured transactions may also be used to reduce concentrations. We also have a set of portfolio concentration limits in place to control exposures by country, industry, product and activity. Further, our policies require limits to be established as appropriate for new initiatives and implementation of strategies involving material levels of credit risk. Concentration limits represent the maximum exposure levels we wish to hold on our books. In the normal course, it is expected that exposures will be held at levels below the maximums. The credit concentration limits are reviewed and approved by the RMC at least annually.\n\nCredit concentration limits are also applied to our retail lending portfolios to mitigate concentration risk. We not only have concentration limits applied to individual borrowers and geographic regions, but also to different types of credit facilities, such as unsecured credits. In addition, we limit the maximum insured mortgage exposure to private insurers in order to reduce counterparty risk.\n\n## Credit risk mitigation\n\nWe may mitigate credit risk by obtaining a pledge of collateral, which improves recoveries in the event of a default. Our credit risk management policies include verification of the collateral and its value and ensuring that we have legal certainty with respect to the assets pledged. Valuations are updated periodically depending on the nature of the collateral, legal environment, and the creditworthiness of the counterparty. The main types of collateral include: (i) cash or marketable securities for securities lending and repurchase transactions; (ii) cash or marketable securities taken as collateral in support of our OTC derivatives activity; (iii) charges over operating assets such as inventory, receivables and real estate properties for lending to small business and commercial borrowers; and (iv) mortgages over residential properties for retail lending.\n\nIn certain circumstances we may use third-party guarantees to mitigate risk. We also obtain insurance to reduce the risk in our real estate secured lending portfolios, the most material of which relates to the portion of our residential mortgage portfolio that is insured by CMHC, an agency of the Government of Canada.\n\nWe mitigate the trading credit risk of OTC derivatives, securities lending and repurchase transactions with counterparties by employing the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) Master Agreement, as well as Credit Support Annexes (CSAs) or similar master and collateral agreements. See Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for additional details on the risks related to the use of derivatives and how we manage these risks.\n\nISDA Master Agreements and similar master and collateral agreements, such as the Global Master Repurchase Agreement and Global Master Securities Lending Agreement, facilitate cross transaction payments, prescribe close-out netting processes, and define the counterparties' contractual trading relationship. In addition, the agreements formalize non-transaction-specific terms. Master agreements serve to mitigate our credit risk by outlining default and termination events, which enable parties to close out of all outstanding transactions in the case of a negative credit event on either party's side. The mechanism for calculating termination costs in the event of a close-out are outlined in the master agreement; this allows for the efficient calculation of a single net obligation of one party to another.\n\nCSAs and other collateral agreements are often included in ISDA Master Agreements or similar master agreements governing securities lending and repurchase transactions. They mitigate CCR by providing for the exchange of collateral between parties when a party's exposure to the other exceeds agreed upon thresholds, subject to a minimum transfer amount. CSAs and other collateral agreements that operate with master agreements also designate acceptable collateral types, and set out rules for re-hypothecation and interest calculation on collateral. Collateral types permitted under CSAs and other master agreements are set through our trading credit risk management documentation procedures. These procedures include requirements around collateral type concentrations.\n\nConsistent with global initiatives to improve resilience in the financial system, we clear derivatives through central counterparties (CCPs) where feasible. Credit derivatives may be used to reduce industry sector concentrations and single-name exposure.\n\n## Forbearance techniques\n\nWe employ forbearance techniques to manage client relationships and to minimize credit losses due to default, foreclosure or repossession. In certain circumstances, it may be necessary to modify a loan for reasons related to a borrower's financial difficulties, reducing the potential of default. Total debt restructurings are subject to our normal quarterly impairment review which considers, amongst other factors, covenants and/or payment delinquencies. Loan loss provisions are adjusted as appropriate.\n\nIn retail lending, forbearance techniques include interest capitalization, amortization amendments and debt consolidations. We have a set of eligibility criteria that allow our Client Account Management team to determine suitable remediation strategies and propose products based on each borrower's situation.\n\nThe solutions available to corporate and commercial clients vary based on the individual nature of the client's situation and are undertaken selectively where it has been determined that the client has or is likely to have repayment difficulties servicing its obligations. Covenants often reveal changes in the client's financial situation before there is a change in payment behaviour and typically allow for a right to reprice or accelerate payments. Solutions may be temporary in nature or may involve other special management options.\n\n## Process and control\n\nThe credit approval process is managed by Risk Management and Retail Operations, with all significant credit requests submitted subject to adjudication independent of the originating businesses. Approval authorities are a function of the risk and amount of credit requested. In certain cases, credit requests must be escalated to senior management, the CRO, or to the RMC for approval.\n\nAfter initial approval, individual credit exposures continue to be monitored. A formal risk assessment is completed at least annually for all risk-rated accounts, including review of assigned ratings. Higher risk-rated accounts are subject to closer monitoring and are reviewed at least quarterly. Collections and specialized loan workout groups handle the day-to-day management of high-risk loans to maximize recoveries.\n\n## Risk measurement\n\n## Exposures subject to IRB approaches\n\nUnder the IRB approaches, we are required to categorize exposures to credit risk into broad classes of assets with different underlying risk characteristics. This asset categorization may differ from the presentation in our consolidated financial statements. Under the IRB approaches, credit risk is measured using the following three key risk parameters : (1)\n\n- \u0081 PD - the probability that the obligor will default within the next 12 months.\n- \u0081 EAD - the estimate of the amount that will be drawn at the time of default.\n- \u0081 LGD - the expected severity of loss as the result of the default, expressed as a percentage of the EAD.",

        "page_content": "Exposures under the IRB approaches can be further differentiated into two categories, AIRB and FIRB. For portfolios subject to the AIRB approach, PD, LGD and EAD are internal estimates. Certain portfolios are prescribed to use the FIRB approach, where LGD and EAD are regulatory defined parameters. Our credit risk exposures are divided into business and government and retail portfolios. Regulatory models used to measure credit risk exposure under the IRB approach are subject to CIBC's model risk management process.\n\n- (1)  These parameters differ from those used in the calculation of ECL under IFRS 9. See the 'Accounting and control matters' section for further details.\n\n## Business and government portfolios (excluding scored small business) - risk-rating method\n\nThe portfolios comprise exposures to corporate, sovereign, and bank obligors. Our adjudication process and criteria includes assigning an obligor rating that reflects our estimate of the financial strength of the borrower, and a facility rating or LGD rating that reflects the collateral amount and quality applicable to secured exposures, the seniority position of the claim, and the capital structure of the borrower for unsecured exposures.\n\nThe obligor rating takes into consideration our financial assessment of the obligor, the industry, and the economic environment of the region in which the obligor operates. Where a guarantee from a third-party exists, both the obligor and the guarantor will be assessed. While our obligor rating is determined independently of external ratings for the obligor, our risk-rating methodology includes a review of those external ratings.\n\nCIBC employs a 20-point master internal obligor default rating scale that broadly maps to external agencies' ratings as presented in the table below.\n\n| Grade                | CIBC rating   | S&P equivalent   | Moody's equivalent   |\n|----------------------|---------------|------------------|----------------------|\n| Investment grade     | 00-47         | AAA to BBB-      | Aaa to Baa3          |\n| Non-investment grade | 51-67         | BB+ to B-        | Ba1 to B3            |\n| Watch list           | 70-80         | CCC+ to C        | Caa1 to Ca           |\n| Default              | 90            | D                | C                    |\n\nWe use quantitative modelling techniques to assist in the development of internal risk-rating systems. The risk-rating systems have been developed through analysis of internal and external credit risk data, supplemented with expert judgment. The risk ratings are used for portfolio management, risk limit setting, product pricing, and in the determination of regulatory and economic capital.\n\nOur credit process is designed to ensure that we approve applications and extend credit only where we believe that our client has the ability to repay according to the agreed terms and conditions.\n\nOur credit framework of policies and limits defines our appetite for exposure to any single name or group of related borrowers, which is a function of the internal risk rating. We generally extend new credit only to borrowers in the investment and non-investment grade categories noted above. Our credit policies are also defined to manage our exposure to concentration in borrowers in any particular industry or region.\n\nIn accordance with our process, each obligor is assigned an obligor default rating and the assigned rating is mapped to a PD estimate that represents a long-run average one-year default likelihood. For corporate obligors, PD estimates are calculated using joint maximum likelihood techniques based on our internal default rate history by rating category and longer dated external default rates as a proxy for the credit cycle to arrive at long-run average PD estimates. Estimates drawn from third-party statistical default prediction models are used to supplement the internal default data for some rating bands where internal data is sparse. For small and medium corporate enterprises, PD estimates are developed using only internal default history. For bank and sovereign obligors, PD estimates are derived from an analysis based on external default data sets and supplemented with internal data where possible. We examine several different estimation methodologies and compare results across the different techniques. In addition, we apply the same techniques and estimation methodologies to analogous corporate default data and compare the results for banks and sovereigns to the corporate estimates for each technique. A regulatory floor is applied to PD estimates for corporate and bank obligors.\n\nEach facility is assigned an LGD rating and each assigned rating is mapped to an LGD estimate that considers economic downturn conditions. For corporate obligors subject to the AIRB approach, LGD estimates are primarily derived from internal historical recovery data. Time to resolution is typically one to two years for most corporate obligors, and one to four years in the real estate sector. LGD values are based on discounted post-default cash flows for resolved accounts and include material direct and indirect costs associated with collections. External data is used in some cases to supplement our analysis. Economic downturn periods are identified for each portfolio by examining the history of actual losses, default rates and LGD. For sovereign exposures, LGD estimates are primarily driven by expert judgment supplemented with external data and benchmarks where available. Appropriate adjustments are made to LGD estimates to account for various uncertainties associated with estimation techniques and data limitations, including adjustments for unresolved accounts. For obligors subjected to the FIRB approach, LGD is a regulatory prescribed calculation.\n\nEAD is estimated based on the current exposure to the obligor together with possible future changes in that exposure. For obligors subject to the AIRB approach, internal EAD estimates are driven by factors such as the available undrawn credit commitment amount and the obligor default rating. EAD estimates are primarily based on internal historical loss data supplemented with comparable external data. Economic downturn periods are identified for each portfolio by examining the historical default rates and actual EAD factors. For obligors subjected to the FIRB approach, EAD is a regulatory prescribed calculation.\n\nAppropriate adjustments are made to internal PD, LGD and EAD estimates to account for various uncertainties associated with estimation techniques and data limitations, including adjustments for unresolved accounts (for LGD).\n\nRegulatory capital slotting approach is used for part of our uninsured Canadian commercial mortgage portfolio, which comprises non-residential mortgages and multi-family residential mortgages. These exposures are individually rated on our rating scale using a risk-rating methodology that considers the property's key attributes, which include its loan-to-value (LTV) and debt service ratios, the quality of the property, and the financial strength of the owner/sponsor. All exposures are secured by a lien over the property. In addition, we have insured multi-family residential mortgages, which are not treated under the slotting approach, but are instead treated as sovereign exposures.\n\n## Retail portfolios\n\nRetail portfolios are characterized by a large number of relatively small exposures. They comprise: real estate secured personal lending (residential mortgages and personal loans and lines secured by residential property); qualifying revolving retail exposures (credit cards, overdrafts and unsecured lines of credit); and other retail exposures (loans secured by non-residential assets, unsecured loans, and scored small business loans).\n\nWe use scoring models in the adjudication of new retail credit exposures, which are based on statistical methods of analyzing the unique characteristics of the borrower, to estimate future behaviour. In developing our models, we use internal historical information from previous borrowers, as well as information from external sources, such as credit bureaus. The use of credit scoring models allows for consistent assessment across borrowers. There are specific guidelines in place for each product, and our adjudication decision will take into account the characteristics of",

The lending process will include documentation of, where appropriate, satisfactory identification, proof of income, independent appraisal of the collateral and registration of security.\n\nRetail portfolios are managed as pools of homogeneous risk exposures, using external credit bureau scores and/or other behavioural assessments to group exposures according to similar credit risk profiles. These pools are established through statistical techniques. Characteristics used to group individual exposures vary by asset category; as a result, the number of pools, their size, and the statistical techniques applied to their management differ accordingly.\n\nThe following table maps the PD bands to various risk levels:\n\n| Risk level        | PD bands      |\n|-------------------|---------------|\n| Exceptionally low | 0.01%-0.20%   |\n| Very low          | 0.21%-0.50%   |\n| Low               | 0.51%-2.00%   |\n| Medium            | 2.01%-10.00%  |\n| High              | 10.01%-99.99% |\n| Default           | 100%          |\n\nFor the purposes of the AIRB approach for retail portfolios, additional PD, LGD and EAD segmentation into homogeneous risk exposures is established through statistical techniques. The principal statistical estimation technique is decision trees benchmarked against alternative techniques such as regression and random forests.\n\nWithin real estate secured lending, we have two key parameter estimation models: mortgages and real estate secured personal lines of credit. Within qualifying revolving retail, we have three key parameter estimation models: credit cards, overdraft, and unsecured personal lines. A small percentage of credit cards, overdraft, and unsecured line accounts that do not satisfy the requirements for qualifying revolving retail are grouped into other retail parameter models. Within other retail, we have three key parameter models: margin lending, personal loans, and scored small business loans. Each parameter model pools accounts according to characteristics such as: delinquency, current credit bureau score, internal behaviour score, estimated current LTV ratio, account type, account age, utilization, transactor/revolver, outstanding balance, or authorized limit.\n\nPD is estimated as the average default rate over an extended period based on internal historical data, generally for a 5-to-10-year period, which is adjusted using internal historical data on default rates over a longer period or comparable external data that includes a period of stress. A regulatory floor is applied to our PD estimate for all retail exposures with the exception of insured mortgages and government-guaranteed loans. A higher regulatory floor is applied to qualifying revolving transactors.\n\nLGD is estimated based on observed recovery rates over an extended period using internal historical data. In determining our LGD estimate, we exclude any accounts that have not had enough time since default for the substantial majority of expected recovery to occur. This recovery period is product-specific and is typically in the range of 1 to 3 years. Accounts that cure from default and return to good standing are considered to have zero loss. We simulate the loss rate in a significant downturn based on the relationship(s) between LGD and one or more of the following: PD; housing prices, cure rate, and recovery time; or observed LGD in periods with above-average loss rates. We apply appropriate adjustments to address various types of estimation uncertainty including sampling error and trending. A regulatory floor is applied to all real estate secured exposures with the exception of insured mortgages. Higher regulatory floors are applied to unsecured accounts.\n\nEAD for revolving products is estimated as a percentage of the authorized credit limit based on the observed EAD rates over an extended period using historical data. We simulate the EAD rate in a significant downturn based on the relationship(s) between the EAD rate and PD and/ or the observed EAD rate in periods with above-average EAD rates. For term loan products, EAD is set equal to the outstanding balance. A regulatory floor is applied to the percentage of the undrawn exposure that is included in EAD.\n\nWe apply appropriate adjustments to PD, LGD and EAD to address various types of estimation uncertainty including sampling error and trending.\n\n## Back-testing\n\nWe monitor the three key risk parameters - PD, EAD and LGD - on a quarterly basis for our business and government portfolios and on a monthly basis for our retail portfolios. Every quarter, the back-testing results are reported to OSFI and are presented to the business and Risk Management senior management for review and challenge. For each parameter, we identify any portfolios whose realized values are significantly above or significantly below expectations and then test to see if this deviation is explainable by changes in the economy. If the results indicate that a parameter model may be losing its predictive power, we prioritize that model for review and update.\n\n## Stress testing\n\nAs part of our regular credit portfolio management process, we conduct stress testing and scenario analyses on our portfolio to quantitatively assess the impact of various historical, as well as hypothetical, stressed conditions, versus limits determined in accordance with our risk appetite. Scenarios are selected to test our exposures to specific industries (e.g., oil and gas and real estate), products (e.g., mortgages and cards), or geographic regions (e.g., Europe and the Caribbean). Results from stress testing are a key input into management decision making, including the determination of limits and strategies for managing our credit exposure. See the 'Real estate secured personal lending' section for further discussion on our residential mortgage portfolio stress testing.",

Gross credit exposure amounts presented in the table below represent our estimate of EAD, which is net of derivative master netting agreements and CVA but is before allowance for credit losses or credit risk mitigation for IRB approaches. Gross credit exposure amounts relating to our business and government portfolios are reduced for collateral held for repo-style transactions, which reflects the EAD value of such collateral. Non-trading equity exposures are not included in the table below as they have been deemed immaterial under the OSFI guidelines, and hence are subject to 100% risk-weighting.\n\n| $ millions, as at October 31                           | 2023  AIRB  Standardized   | 2023  AIRB  Standardized    | 2023  AIRB  Standardized   | 2023  AIRB  Standardized   | 2022          | 2022      |\n|--------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|-----------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|---------------|-----------|\n|                                                        | IRB  approach              | (1)  Standardized  approach | Total                      | approach                   | approach      | Total     |\n| Business and government portfolios                     |                            |                             |                            |                            |               |           |\n| Corporate   (2)                                        |                            |                             |                            |                            |               |           |\n| Drawn                                                  | $  139,744                 | $  48,032  $                | 187,776                    | $  151,361                 | $  45,924  $  | 197,285   |\n| Undrawn commitments                                    | 49,460                     | 9,388                       | 58,848                     | 64,470                     | 10,142        | 74,612    |\n| Repo-style transactions  (3)                           | 262,175                    | -

This includes S&P and Moody's issuer-specific credit ratings for securities issued by sovereigns and corporates, the S&P country credit rating for the country of incorporation for securities issued by banks, and deposits with banks, and the S&P country credit rating for deposits with central banks. The RWA calculated using credit ratings from these agencies represents 0.8% of credit risk RWA under the standardized approach.\n\n## Trading credit exposures\n\nWe have trading credit exposure (also called counterparty credit exposure) that arises from our OTC derivatives and our repo-style transactions. The nature of our derivatives exposure and how it is mitigated is further explained in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements. Our repostyle transactions consist of our securities bought or sold under repurchase agreements, and our securities borrowing and lending activity.\n\nThe PD of our counterparties is estimated using models consistent with the models used for our direct lending activity, or as prescribed. Due to the fluctuations in the market values of interest rates, exchange rates, and equity and commodity prices, counterparty credit exposure cannot be quantified with certainty at the inception of the trade. Counterparty credit exposure is estimated using the current fair value of the exposure, plus an estimate of the maximum potential future exposure due to changes in the fair value. Credit risk associated with these counterparties is managed within the same process as our lending business, and for the purposes of credit adjudication, the exposure is aggregated with any exposure arising from our lending business. The majority of our counterparty credit exposure benefits from the credit risk mitigation techniques discussed above, including daily re-margining, and posting of collateral.\n\nWe are also exposed to wrong-way risk. Specific wrong-way risk arises when CIBC receives financial collateral issued (or an underlying reference obligation of a transaction is issued) by the counterparty itself, or by a related entity that would be considered to be part of the same common risk group. General wrong-way risk arises when the exposure and/or collateral pledged to CIBC is highly correlated to that of the counterparty. Exposure to wrong-way risk with derivative counterparties is monitored by Capital Markets Risk Management. Where we may be exposed to wrong-way risk, our adjudication procedures subject those transactions to a more rigorous approval process. The exposure may be hedged with other derivatives to further mitigate the risk that can arise from these transactions.\n\nWe establish a CVA for expected future credit losses from each of our derivative counterparties. The expected future credit loss is a function of our estimates of the PD, the estimated loss in the event of default, and other factors such as risk mitigants.\n\n## Rating profile of OTC derivative mark-to-market (MTM) receivables\n\n| $ billions, as at October 31   | 2023          | 2023          | 2022          | 2022          |\n|--------------------------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|\n|                                | Exposure  (1) | Exposure  (1) | Exposure  (1) | Exposure  (1) |\n| Investment grade               | $  8.04       | 89.6 %        | $  11.18      | 79.1 %        |\n| Non-investment grade           | 0.92          | 10.3          | 2.87          | 20.3          |\n| Watch list                     | 0.01          | 0.1           | 0.09          | 0.6           |\n| Default                        | -             | -             | -             | -             |\n| Unrated                        | -             | -             | -             | -             |\n|                                | $  8.97       | 100.0 %       | $  14.14      | 100.0 %       |\n\n## Concentration of exposures\n\nConcentration of credit risk exists when a number of obligors are engaged in similar activities, or operate in the same geographic areas or industry sectors, and have similar economic characteristics so that their ability to meet contractual obligations is similarly affected by changes in economic, political, or other conditions.",

CIBC participated in a number of those programs, including the Canada Emergency Business Account (CEBA) program with Export Development Canada (EDC). Loans advanced under the CEBA program are not recognized on our consolidated balance sheet because they are funded by EDC and all of the resulting cash flows and associated risks and rewards, including any exposure to payment defaults and principal forgiveness, are assumed by EDC. As at October 31, 2023, loans of $3.5 billion (2022: $4.1 billion), net of repayments, have been provided to our clients under the CEBA. Funded loans outstanding on our consolidated balance sheet under other Canadian lending programs for businesses that commenced during the pandemic were $0.3 billion (2022: $0.4 billion).\n\n## Real estate secured personal lending\n\nReal estate secured personal lending comprises residential mortgages, and personal loans and lines secured by residential property (HELOC). This portfolio is lower risk compared with other retail portfolios, as we have a first charge on the majority of the properties and a second lien on only a small portion of the portfolio. We use the same lending criteria in the adjudication of both first lien and second lien loans.\n\nUnder the Bank Act (Canada), banks are limited to providing residential real estate loans of no more than 80% of the collateral value. An exception is made for mortgage loans with a higher LTV ratio if they are insured by either CMHC or a private mortgage insurer. Mortgage insurance protects banks from the risk of default by the borrower, over the term of the coverage. Mortgage insurers are subject to regulatory capital requirements, which aim to ensure that they are well capitalized. If a private mortgage insurer becomes insolvent, the Government of Canada has, provided certain conditions are met, obligations in respect of policies underwritten by certain insolvent private mortgage insurers as more fully described in the Protection of Residential Mortgage or Hypothecary Insurance Act (PRMHIA). There is a possibility that losses could be incurred in respect of insured mortgages if, among other things, CMHC or the applicable private mortgage insurer denies a claim, or further, if a private mortgage insurer becomes insolvent and either the conditions under the PRMHIA are not met or the Government of Canada denies the claim.\n\nThe following disclosures are required by OSFI pursuant to the Guideline B-20 'Residential Mortgage Underwriting Practices and Procedures' (Guideline B-20).\n\nThe following table provides details on our residential mortgage and HELOC portfolios:\n\n|                                       | Residential mortgages  (1)   | Residential mortgages  (1)   | Residential mortgages  (1)   | Residential mortgages  (1)   | HELOC  (2)   | HELOC  (2)   | Total   | Total   | Total     | Total     |\n|---------------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|--------------|--------------|---------|---------|-----------|-----------|\n| $ billions, as at October 31, 2023    | Insured                      | Insured                      | Uninsured                    | Uninsured                    | Uninsured    | Uninsured    | Insured | Insured | Uninsured | Uninsured |\n| Ontario (3)                           | $  19.5                      | 13 %                         | $  129.8                     | 87 %                         | $  10.8      | 100 %        | $  19.5 | 12 %    | $  140.6  | 88 %      |\n| British Columbia and territories  (4) | 6.4                          | 12                           | 45.5                         | 88                           | 3.9          | 100          | 6.4     | 11      | 49.4      | 89        |\n| Alberta                               | 10.9                         | 41                           | 15.5                         | 59                           | 1.8          | 100          | 10.9    | 39      | 17.3      | 61        |\n| Quebec                                | 4.8                          | 22                           | 17.1                         | 78                           | 1.2          | 100          | 4.8     | 21      | 18.3      | 79        |\n| Central prairie provinces             | 2.9                          | 40                           | 4.4                          | 60                           | 0.6          | 100          | 2.9     | 37      | 5.0       | 63        |\n| Atlantic provinces                    | 2.9                          | 32                           | 6.2                          | 68                           | 0.7          | 100          | 2.9     | 30      | 6.9       | 70        |\n| Canadian portfolio (6)  (5)           | 47.4                         | 18                           | 218.5                        | 82                           | 19.0         | 100          | 47.4    | 17      | 237.5     | 83        |\n| U.S. portfolio (5)                    | -                            | -                            | 2.6                          | 100                          | -            | -            | -       | -       | 2.6       | 100       |\n| Other international portfolio  (5)    | -                            | -                            | 2.8                          | 100                          | -            | -            | -       | -       | 2.8       | 100       |\n| Total portfolio                       | $ 47.4                       | 17 %                         | $  223.9                     | 83 %                         | $  19.0      | 100 %        | $  47.4 | 16 %    | $  242.9  | 84 %      |\n| October 31, 2022                      | $  52.6                      | 20 %                         | $  214.2                     | 80 %                         | $  19.4      | 100 %        | $  52.6 | 18 %    | $  233.6  | 82 %      |",

The increase in interest rates had no impact on the remaining amortization period for fixed rate mortgages which in the current interest rate environment are assumed to be renewed at the same or a shorter amortization period.\n\nWe have two types of condominium exposures in Canada: mortgages and developer loans. Both are primarily concentrated in the Toronto and Vancouver areas. As at October 31, 2023, our Canadian condominium mortgages were $40.2 billion (2022: $38.7 billion), of which 18% (2022: 20%) were insured. Our drawn developer loans were $2.2 billion (2022: $1.7 billion), or 1.1% (2022: 0.8%) of our business and government portfolio, and our related undrawn exposure was $6.3 billion (2022: $5.9 billion). The condominium developer exposure is diversified across 121 projects.",

        "page_content": "We stress test our mortgage and HELOC portfolios to determine the potential impact of different economic events. Our stress tests can use variables such as unemployment rates, debt service ratios and housing price changes, to model potential outcomes for a given set of circumstances. The stress testing involves variables that could behave differently in certain situations. Our main tests use economic variables in a similar range or more conservative to historical events when Canada experienced economic downturns. Our results show that in an economic downturn, our capital position should be sufficient to absorb mortgage and HELOC losses.\n\nOn December 17, 2021, OSFI and the Department of Finance Canada confirmed that the minimum qualifying rate for uninsured and insured mortgages will remain the higher of: (i) the mortgage contract rate plus 2%; or (ii) 5.25% as a minimum floor.\n\n## OSFI Clarification on the Treatment of Innovative Real Estate Secured Lending Products under Guideline B-20\n\nOn June 28, 2022, OSFI released a new Advisory (Clarification on the Treatment of Innovative Real Estate Secured Lending Products under Guideline B-20), which complements existing expectations under Guideline B-20. The Advisory articulates OSFI's expectations regarding underwriting practices and procedures for reverse residential mortgages, residential mortgages with shared equity features and Combined Loan Plans (CLPs), which are applicable to all FRFIs that are engaged in residential mortgage underwriting and/or the acquisition of residential mortgage loan assets in Canada. The changes will affect CIBC's Home Power Plan (HPP) product, which is considered a CLP, with LTVs above 65% when combined with related mortgage products. OSFI expects that the portion of an HPP balance above the 65% LTV limit must be amortizing and non-readvanceable. For previously originated HPPs, principal payments on both the mortgage and HPP are required to be matched by a reduction in the aggregate authorized limit until it reduces to a 65% LTV. OSFI expects this change to take place for existing borrowers upon the first renewal date of their HPP mortgage after October 2023. We discontinued the origination of HPPs that do not meet these requirements in October 2023, and are converting existing HPPs to meet the requirement.\n\n## Credit quality performance\n\nAs at October 31, 2023, total loans and acceptances after allowance for credit losses were $540.2 billion (2022: $528.7 billion). Consumer loans (comprising residential mortgages, credit cards, and personal loans, including student loans) constitute 62% (2022: 62%) of the portfolio, and business and government loans (including acceptances) constitute the remainder of the portfolio.\n\nConsumer loans were up $6.6 billion or 2% from the prior year, primarily due to an increase in residential mortgages and credit cards. Business and government loans (including acceptances) were up $4.9 billion or 2% from the prior year, mainly attributable to the impact of foreign exchange appreciation, as well as growth in the real estate and construction, and utilities portfolios, partially offset by a decrease in business services.\n\n## Impaired loans\n\nThe following table provides details of our impaired loans and allowance for credit losses:\n\n| $ millions, as at or for the year ended October 31              | 2023                            | 2023            | 2023     | 2022                            | 2022            | 2022     |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|-----------------|----------|---------------------------------|-----------------|----------|\n|                                                                 | Business and  government  loans | Consumer  loans | Total    | Business and  government  loans | Consumer  loans | Total    |\n| Gross impaired loans                                            |                                 |                 |          |                                 |                 |          |\n| Balance at beginning of year                                    | $  920                          | $  823          | $  1,743 | $ 1,033                         | $  800          | $  1,833 |\n| Classified as impaired during the year                          | 1,842                           | 2,053           | 3,895    | 491                             | 1,456           | 1,947    |\n| Transferred to performing during the year                       | (101)                           | (405)           | (506)    | (100)                           | (294)           | (394)    |\n| Net repayments  (1)                                             | (429)                           | (409)           | (838)    | (243)                           | (448)           | (691)    |\n| Amounts written off                                             | (316)                           | (1,033)         | (1,349)  | (312)                           | (718)           | (1,030)  |\n| Foreign exchange and other                                      | 40                              | 5               | 45       | 51                              | 27              | 78       |\n| Balance at end of year                                          | $  1,956                        | $  1,034        | $  2,990 | $  920                          | $  823          | $  1,743 |\n| Allowance for credit losses -

exposure\n\nOur drawn real estate and construction portfolio in the U.S. was $23,468 million as at October 31, 2023, including $4,723 million (US$3,405 million) related to U.S. office real estate exposure. Our total drawn commercial loans outstanding related to U.S. office commercial real estate was $5,067 million (US$3,653 million), including $344 million (US$248 million) in sectors outside of real estate and construction, out of which $913 million (US$659 million) was impaired. The average LTV at origination of the portfolio was 60%, however values have dropped significantly due to sector headwinds. We are closely monitoring this portfolio as conditions evolve.\n\n## Settlement risk\n\nSettlement risk is the risk that during an agreed concurrent exchange of currency or principal payments, the counterparty will fail to make its payment to CIBC. This risk can arise in general trading activities and from payment and settlement system participation.\n\nMany global settlement systems offer significant risk reduction benefits through complex risk mitigation frameworks. Bilateral payment netting agreements may be put in place to mitigate risk by reducing the aggregate settlement amount between counterparties. Further, we participate in several North American payment and settlement systems, including a global foreign exchange multilateral netting system. We also use financial intermediaries to access some payment and settlement systems, and for certain trades, we may utilize an established clearing house to minimize settlement risk.\n\nTransactions settled outside of payment and settlement systems or clearing houses require approval of credit facilities for counterparties, either as pre-approved settlement risk limits or payment-versus-payment arrangements.",

        "page_content": "## Securitization activities\n\nWe engage in three types of securitization activities: we securitize assets that we originate, we securitize assets originated by third parties and we engage in trading activities related to securitized products.\n\nWe securitize assets that we originate principally as a funding mechanism. The credit risk on the underlying assets in these transactions is transferred to the SE, with CIBC retaining first loss exposure and other investors exposed to the remaining credit risk.\n\nSecuritization activities relating to assets originated by third parties can include the securitization of those assets through ABCP conduits (or similar programs) that we sponsor (including both consolidated and non-consolidated SEs; see the 'Off-balance sheet arrangements' section and Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements for additional details), or through direct exposure to a client-sponsored structured entity. Risks associated with securitization exposures to client-originated assets are mitigated through the transaction structure, which includes credit enhancements. For the transactions where we retain credit risk on the exposures that we hold, we earn interest income on these holdings. For the transactions in the non-consolidated ABCP conduits, we are also exposed to liquidity risk associated with the potential inability to roll over maturing ABCP in the market. We earn fee income for the services that we provide to these ABCP conduits.\n\nWe are also involved in the trading of asset-backed securities (ABS) and ABCP to earn income in our role as underwriter and market maker. We are exposed to credit and market risk on the securities that we hold in inventory on a temporary basis until such securities are sold to an investor.\n\nCapital requirements for exposures arising from securitization activities are determined using one of the following approaches: SEC-IRBA, SEC-ERBA, SEC-IAA, or SEC-SA.\n\nThe SEC-IAA process relies on internal risk ratings and is utilized for securitization exposures relating to ABCP conduits when external ratings are not available for the securitization exposures but the ABCP itself is externally rated. The internal assessment process involves an evaluation of a number of factors, including, but not limited to, pool characteristics, including asset eligibility criteria and concentration limits, transaction triggers, the asset seller's risk profile, servicing capabilities, and cash flow stress testing. Cash flows are stress-tested based on historical asset performance using our internal cash flow stress testing models by asset type. These models are subject to our model risk mitigation policies and are independently reviewed by the Model Validation team in Risk Management. The stress test factors used to determine the transaction risk profile and required credit enhancement levels are tailored for each asset type and transaction based on the assessment of the factors described above and are done in accordance with our internal risk rating methodologies and guidelines. Internal risk ratings are mapped to equivalent external ratings of external credit assessment institutions (DBRS, Fitch, Moody's and S&P) and are used to determine the appropriate risk weights for capital purposes. Securitization exposures and underlying asset performance are monitored on an ongoing basis. Risk Management serves as a second line of defence providing independent oversight regarding risk rating assumptions and adjudicating on the assignment of the internal risk ratings. SEC-IAA applies to various consumer and corporate/commercial asset types in our ABCP conduits including, but not limited to, auto loans and leases, consumer loans, credit cards, equipment loans and leases, fleet lease receivables, franchise loans, residential mortgages and residential rental equipment.\n\nInternal risk ratings determined for securitization exposures are also used in the estimation of ECL as required under IFRS 9, determining economic capital, and for setting risk limits.",

        "page_content": "## Market risk\n\nMarket risk is the risk of economic and/or financial loss in our trading and non-trading portfolios from adverse changes in underlying market factors, including interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity market prices, commodity prices, credit spreads, and customer behaviour for retail products. Market risk arises in CIBC's trading and treasury activities, and encompasses all market-related positioning and market-making activity.\n\nThe trading portfolio consists of positions in financial instruments and commodities held to meet the near-term needs of our clients. The non-trading portfolio consists of positions in various currencies that are related to ALM and investment activities.\n\n## Governance and management\n\nMarket risk is managed through the three lines of defence model. The first line of defence comprises frontline businesses and governance groups that are responsible for managing the market risk associated with their activities.\n\nThe second line of defence is Risk Management, which has a dedicated market risk manager for each trading business, supplemented by regional risk managers located in all of our major trading centres, facilitating comprehensive risk coverage, including the measurement, monitoring and control of market risk.\n\nInternal audit is the third line of defence providing reasonable assurance to senior management and the Audit Committee of the Board on the effectiveness of CIBC's governance practices, risk management processes, and internal control as part of its risk-based audit plan and in accordance with its mandate as described in the Internal Audit Charter.\n\nSenior management reports material risk matters to the GRC and RMC at least quarterly, including material transactions, limit compliance, and portfolio trends.\n\n## Policies\n\nWe have comprehensive policies for the management of market risk. These policies are related to the identification and measurement of various types of market risk, their inclusion in the trading portfolio, and the establishment of limits within which we monitor, manage and report our overall exposures. Our policies also outline the requirements for the construction of valuation models, model review and validation, independent checking of the valuation of positions, the establishment of valuation adjustments, and alignment with accounting policies including MTM and mark-to-model methodologies.\n\n## Market risk limits\n\nWe have risk tolerance levels, expressed in terms of statistically based VaR measures, potential stress losses, and notional or other limits as appropriate. We use a multi-tiered approach to set limits on the amounts of risk that we can assume in our trading and non-trading activities, as follows:\n\n- \u0081 Board limits control consolidated market risk;\n- \u0081 Management limits control market risk for CIBC overall and are lower than the Board limits to allow for a buffer in the event of extreme market moves and/or extraordinary client needs;\n- \u0081 Tier 2 limits control market risk at the business unit level; and\n- \u0081 Tier 3 limits control market risk at the sub-business unit or desk level.\n\nManagement limits are established by the CRO, consistent with the risk appetite statement approved by the Board. Tier 2 and Tier 3 limits are approved at levels of management commensurate with the risk assumed.\n\n## Process and control\n\nMarket risk exposures are monitored daily against approved risk limits, and processes are in place to monitor that only authorized activities are undertaken. We generate daily risk and limit-monitoring reports, based on the previous day's positions. Summary market risk and limit compliance reports are produced and reviewed periodically with the GRC and RMC.\n\n## Risk measurement\n\nWe use the following measures for market risk:\n\n- \u0081 VaR enables the meaningful comparison of the risks in different businesses and asset classes. VaR is determined by the combined modelling of VaR for each of interest rate, credit spread, equity, foreign exchange, commodity, and debt specific risks, along with the portfolio effect arising from the interrelationship of the different risks (diversification effect):\n- \u0081 Interest rate risk measures the impact of changes in interest rates and volatilities on cash instruments and derivatives.\n- \u0081 Credit spread risk measures the impact of changes in credit spreads of provincial, municipal and agency bonds, sovereign bonds, corporate bonds, securitized products, and credit derivatives such as credit default swaps.\n- \u0081 Equity risk measures the impact of changes in equity prices and volatilities.\n- \u0081 Foreign exchange risk measures the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates and volatilities.\n- \u0081 Commodity risk measures the impact of changes in commodity prices and volatilities, including the basis between related commodities.\n- \u0081 Debt specific risk measures the impact of changes in the volatility of the yield of a debt instrument as compared with the volatility of the yield of a representative bond index.\n- \u0081 Diversification effect reflects the risk reduction achieved across various financial instrument types, counterparties, currencies and regions. The extent of the diversification benefit depends on the correlation between the assets and risk factors in the portfolio at a particular time.\n- \u0081 Price sensitivity measures the change in value of a portfolio to a small change in a given underlying parameter, so that component risks may be examined in isolation, and the portfolio rebalanced accordingly to achieve a desired exposure.\n- \u0081 Stressed VaR enables the meaningful comparison of the risks in different businesses and asset classes under stressful conditions. Changes to rates, prices, volatilities, and spreads over a 10-day horizon from a stressful historical period are applied to current positions to determine stressed VaR.\n- \u0081 IRC measures the required capital due to credit migration and default risk for debt securities held in the trading portfolios.\n- \u0081 Back-testing validates the effectiveness of risk measurement through analysis of observed and theoretical profit and loss outcomes.\n- \u0081 Stress testing and scenario analysis provide insight into portfolio behaviour under extreme circumstances.",

Trading revenue (net interest income and non-interest income) is generated from these transactions. Trading instruments are recorded at fair value and include debt and equity securities, as well as interest rate, foreign exchange, equity, commodity, and credit derivative products.\n\n## Value-at-risk\n\nOur VaR methodology is a statistical technique that measures the potential overnight loss at a 99% confidence level. We use a full revaluation historical simulation methodology to compute VaR, stressed VaR and other risk measures.\n\nAlthough a valuable guide to risk, VaR should always be viewed in the context of its limitations. For example:\n\n- \u0081 The use of historical data for estimating future events will not encompass all potential events, particularly those that are extreme in nature.\n- \u0081 The use of a one-day holding period assumes that all positions can be liquidated, or the risks offset in one day. This may not fully reflect the market risk arising at times of severe illiquidity, when a one-day period may be insufficient to liquidate or hedge all positions fully.\n- \u0081 The use of a 99% confidence level does not take into account losses that might occur beyond this level of confidence.\n- \u0081 VaR is calculated on the basis of exposures outstanding at the close of business and assumes no management action to mitigate losses.\n\nThe VaR table below presents market risks by type of risk and in aggregate. The risks are interrelated and the diversification effect reflects the reduction of risk due to portfolio effects among the trading positions. Our trading risk exposures to interest rates and credit spreads arise from activities in the global debt and derivative markets, particularly from transactions in the Canadian, U.S. and European markets. The primary instruments are government and corporate debt, and interest rate derivatives. The majority of the trading exposure to foreign exchange risk arises from transactions involving the Canadian dollar, U.S. dollar, Euro, Pound sterling, Australian dollar, Chinese yuan and Japanese yen, whereas the primary risks of losses in equities are in the U.S., Canadian and European markets. Trading exposure to commodities arises primarily from transactions involving North American natural gas, crude oil products, and precious metals.",

The model inputs are calibrated to historical data from a continuous 12-month period of significant financial stress relevant to our current portfolio since December 2006. In 2023, our stressed VaR window has been the 2008-2009 Global Financial Crisis period. This historical period exhibited not only increased volatility in interest rates but also increased volatility in equity prices, combined with a reduction in the level of interest rates, and an increase in credit spreads.\n\n## Incremental risk charge\n\nIRC is a measure of default and migration risk for debt securities held in the trading portfolios. Our IRC methodology measures the risk of issuer migration and default, at a 99.9% confidence level, over a period of one year.\n\n| $ millions, as at or for the year ended October 31   | 2023  2022   | 2023  2022   | 2023  2022   | 2023  2022   | 2023  2022   | 2023  2022   | 2023  2022   | 2023  2022   |\n|------------------------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|\n|                                                      | High         | Low          | As at        | Average      | High         | Low          | As at        | Average      |\n| Interest rate risk                                   | $  11.7      | $  4.9       | $  7.9       | $  7.2       | $  16.3      | $  4.7       | $  6.0       | $  7.3       |\n| Credit spread risk                                   | 2.5          | 1.0          | 2.1          | 1.5          | 11.0         | 0.9          | 1.1          | 3.4          |\n| Equity risk                                          | 8.6          | 3.3          | 4.6          | 5.4          | 10.5         | 2.6          | 4.1          | 4.9          |\n| Foreign exchange risk                                | 3.4          | 0.3          | 1.2          | 0.8          | 4.8          | 0.5          | 1.2          | 1.8          |\n| Commodity risk                                       | 4.1          | 1.2          | 1.9          | 2.3          | 6.0          | 1.1          | 1.4          | 2.3          |\n| Debt specific risk                                   | 3.9          | 1.3          | 3.3          | 2.1          | 3.3          | 1.2          | 1.9          | 2.2          |\n| Diversification effect  (1)                          | n/m          | n/m          | (10.5)       | (10.1)       | n/m          | n/m          | (8.1)        | (13.2)       |\n| Total VaR (one-day measure)                          | $  13.2      | $  6.6       | $  10.5      | $  9.2       | $  14.6      | $  5.5       | $  7.6       | $  8.7       |\n| Stressed total VaR (one-day measure)                 | $  62.2      | $  14.2      | $  32.0      | $  36.9      | $  49.9      | $  16.1      | $  31.2      | $  30.0      |\n| IRC (one-year measure)  (2)                          | $  150.0     | $  82.4      | $  101.9     | $  107.3     | $  178.9     | $  95.7      | $  114.0     | $  130.7     |\n\n- (1)  Total VaR is less than the sum of the VaR of the different market risk types due to risk offsets resulting from a portfolio diversification effect.\n- (2)  High and low IRC are not equal to the sum of the constituent parts, because the highs and lows of the constituent parts may occur on different days.\n- n/m Not meaningful. It is not meaningful to compute a diversification effect because the high and low may occur on different days for different risk types.\n\nAverage total VaR for the year ended October 31, 2023 was up $0.5 million from the prior year, driven primarily by a decrease in the diversification benefit and an increase in equity risk, offset by decreases in credit spread and foreign exchange risks.\n\nAverage stressed total VaR for the year ended October 31, 2023 was up $6.9 million from the prior year. The increase was primarily due to foreign exchange, interest rate and equity risks.\n\nAverage IRC for the year ended October 31, 2023 was down $23.4 million from the prior year due to decreases in trading book bond inventory and improved credit quality within our fixed income portfolio.\n\n## Back-testing\n\nTo determine the reliability of the trading VaR model, outcomes are monitored regularly through a back-testing process to test the validity of the assumptions and the parameters used in the trading VaR calculation. The back-testing process includes calculating a hypothetical or static profit and loss and comparing that result with calculated VaR. Static profit and loss represents the change in value of the prior day's closing portfolio due to each day's price movements, on the assumption that the portfolio remained unchanged. The back-testing process is conducted on a daily basis at the consolidated CIBC level as well as business lines and individual portfolios.\n\nStatic profit and loss in excess of the one-day VaR are investigated. The back-testing process, including the investigation of results, is performed by risk professionals who are independent of those responsible for development of the model.\n\nBased on our back-testing results, we are able to ensure that our VaR model continues to appropriately measure risk.\n\nDuring the year, there was one negative back-testing breach of the total VaR measure at the consolidated CIBC level, driven by the volatility in CAD and, to a lesser extent, USD interest rates.",

        "page_content": "## Stress testing and scenario analysis\n\nStress testing and scenario analysis is designed to add insight into possible outcomes of abnormal market conditions, and to highlight possible concentration of risk.\n\nWe measure the effect on portfolio valuations under a wide range of extreme moves in market risk factors. Our approach simulates the impact on earnings of extreme market events over a one-month time horizon, and in most cases assume that no risk-mitigating actions are taken during this period to reflect the reduced market liquidity that typically accompanies such events.\n\nScenarios are developed using historical market data during periods of market disruption, or are based on hypothetical impacts of economic events, political events, and natural disasters as predicted by economists, business leaders, and risk managers.\n\nAmong the historical scenarios are the 2022 period of U.S. Federal Reserve tightening, and the market events following the 2008 market crisis along with the COVID-19 pandemic. The hypothetical scenarios include potential market crises originating in North America, Europe and Asia.\n\nThe hypothetical scenarios are informed from current themes in geopolitics, central bank action and various macro themes originating in North America, Europe and Asia. These include considering the impact of further escalation in the war in Ukraine, possible conflict between Taiwan and China and the further impact of rising energy prices. Furthermore, during the past year, we continued to review and iterate various stress scenarios to navigate various crises including the Silicon Valley Bank crisis, concerns about the quality of U.S. sovereign credit, and various geopolitical flashpoints.\n\nStress testing scenarios are periodically reviewed and amended as necessary to ensure they remain relevant. Under stress limit monitoring, limits are placed on the maximum acceptable loss based on risk appetite in aggregate, at the detailed portfolio level, and for specific asset classes.\n\n## Non-trading activities\n\n## Structural interest rate risk (SIRR)\n\nSIRR primarily consists of the risk arising due to mismatches in the timing of the repricing of assets and liabilities, which do not arise from trading and trading-related businesses. The objective of SIRR management is to lock in product spreads and deliver stable and predictable net interest income over time, while managing the risk to the economic value of our assets arising from changes in interest rates.\n\nSIRR results from differences in the maturities or repricing dates of assets and liabilities, both on- and off-balance sheet, as well as from embedded optionality in retail products, and other product features that could affect the expected timing of cash flows, such as options to pre-pay loans or redeem term deposits prior to contractual maturity. A number of assumptions affecting cash flows, product repricing and the administration of rates underlie the models used to measure SIRR. The key assumptions pertain to the expected funding profile of mortgage rate commitments, fixed rate loan prepayment behaviour, term deposit redemption behaviour, the treatment of non-maturity deposits and equity. Assumptions rely on empirical data, based on historical client behaviour, balance sheet composition and product pricing with the consideration of possible forward-looking changes. All models and assumptions used to measure SIRR are subject to independent oversight by Risk Management. A variety of cash instruments and derivatives, primarily interest rate swaps, are used to manage these risks.\n\nThe Board has oversight of the management of SIRR, approves the risk appetite and the associated SIRR risk limits. GALCO and its subcommittee, the Asset Liability Management Committee, regularly review structural market risk positions and provide senior management oversight.\n\nIn addition to Board-approved limits on earnings and economic value exposure, more granular management limits are in place to guide day-to-day management of this risk. The ALM group within Treasury is responsible for the ongoing modelling of structural market risk across the enterprise, with independent oversight and compliance with SIRR policy provided by Risk Management.\n\nALM activities are designed to manage the effects of potential interest rate movements while balancing the cost of any hedging activities on the current net revenue. To monitor and control SIRR, two primary metrics, net interest income (NII) risk and economic value of equity (EVE) risk, are assessed, in addition to stress testing, gap analysis and other market risk metrics. The net interest income sensitivity is a measure of the impact of potential changes in interest rates on the projected 12-month pre-tax net interest income of the bank's portfolio of assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet positions in response to prescribed parallel interest rate movements with interest rates floored at zero. The EVE sensitivity is a measure of the impact of potential changes in interest rates on the market value of the bank's assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet positions in response to prescribed parallel interest rate movements with interest rates floored at zero.\n\nThe following table shows the potential before-tax impact of an immediate and sustained 100 basis point increase and 100 basis point decrease in interest rates on projected 12-month NII and the EVE for our structural balance sheet, assuming no subsequent hedging management actions or changes in business mix or changes in product margins.\n\n## Structural interest rate sensitivity - measures\n\n| $ millions (pre-tax), as at October 31     | 2023     | 2023   | 2023   | 2022     | 2022   | 2022    |\n|--------------------------------------------|----------|--------|--------|----------|--------|---------|\n|                                            | CAD  (1) | USD    | Total  | CAD  (1) | USD    | Total   |\n| 100 basis point increase in interest rates |          |        |        |          |        |         |\n| Increase (decrease) in net interest income | $  303   | $  91  | $  394 | $  278   | $  (7) | $  271  |\n| Increase (decrease) in EVE                 | (588)    | (295)  | (883)  | (679)    | (336)  | (1,015) |\n| 100 basis point decrease in interest rates |          |        |        |          |        |         |\n| Increase (decrease) in net interest income | (327)    | (88)   | (415)  | (301)    | 4      | (297)   |\n| Increase (decrease) in EVE                 | 507      | 319    | 826    | 604      | 350    | 954     |",

This risk, predominantly in U.S. dollars, is managed using derivative hedges and by funding the investments in matching currencies. We actively manage this position to ensure that the potential impact on our capital ratios is within an acceptable tolerance in accordance with the policy approved by the CRO, while giving consideration to the impact on earnings and shareholders' equity. Structural foreign exchange risk is managed by Treasury under the guidance of GALCO with monitoring and oversight by Risk Management.\n\nA 1% appreciation of the Canadian dollar would reduce our shareholders' equity as at October 31, 2023 by approximately $206 million (2022: $200 million) on an after-tax basis.\n\nOur non-functional currency denominated earnings are converted into the functional currencies through spot or forward foreign exchange transactions. Typically, there is no significant impact of exchange rate fluctuations on our consolidated statement of income.\n\n## Derivatives held for ALM purposes\n\nWhere derivatives are held for ALM purposes, and when transactions meet the criteria specified under IFRS, we apply hedge accounting for the risks being hedged, as discussed in Notes 1, 12 and 13 to the consolidated financial statements. Derivative hedges that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment are referred to as economic hedges and are recorded at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet with changes in fair value recognized in the consolidated statement of income.\n\nEconomic hedges for other than FVO financial instruments may lead to income volatility because the hedged items are recorded either on a cost or amortized cost basis or recorded at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet with changes in fair value recognized through OCI. This accounting income volatility may not be representative of the overall economic risk.\n\n## Equity risk\n\nNon-trading equity risk arises primarily in our strategy and corporate development activities and strategic investments portfolio. The investments comprise public and private equities, investments in limited partnerships, and equity-accounted investments.\n\nThe following table provides the amortized cost and fair values of our non-trading equities:\n\n| $ millions, as at October 31   | $ millions, as at October 31                    | Cost   | Fair value   |\n|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|--------|--------------|\n| 2023                           | Equity securities designated at FVOCI           | $  556 | $ 572        |\n|                                | Equity-accounted investments in associates  (1) | 137    | 240          |\n|                                |                                                 | $ 693  | $ 812        |\n| 2022                           | Equity securities designated at FVOCI           | $ 525  | $ 522        |\n|                                | Equity-accounted investments in associates  (1) | 206    | 230          |\n|                                |                                                 | $ 731  | $  752       |\n\n## Pension risk\n\nWe sponsor defined benefit pension plans in a number of jurisdictions. As at October 31, 2023, our consolidated defined benefit pension plans were in a net asset position of $1,015 million, compared with $1,379 million as at October 31, 2022. The change in the net asset position of our pension plans is disclosed in Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nOur Canadian pension plans represent approximately 90% of our pension plans, the most significant of which is our principal Canadian pension plan (the CIBC Pension Plan). The estimated impact on our Canadian defined benefit obligations of a 100 basis point change in the discount rate is disclosed in Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe MRCC is responsible for sound governance and oversight, and delegates management authority to the Pension Benefits Management Committee (PBMC). An appropriate investment strategy for the CIBC Pension Plan is set through a statement of investment objectives, policies and procedures.\n\nWithin Treasury, the Pension Investment Management department is responsible for developing and implementing custom investment strategies to sustainably deliver pension benefits within manageable risk tolerances and capital impacts. Key risks include actuarial risks (such as longevity risk), interest rate risk, currency risk, and market (investment) risk.\n\nA principal risk for the CIBC Pension Plan is interest rate risk, which it manages through its liability-driven investment strategy which includes a combination of physical bonds and a bond overlay program funded through the use of repurchase agreements. The plan also operates a currency overlay strategy, which may use forwards or similar instruments, to manage and mitigate its currency risk. Investment risk is mitigated through a multi-asset portfolio construction process that diversifies across a variety of market risk drivers.\n\nThe use of derivatives within the CIBC Pension Plan are permitted for risk management and rebalancing purposes, as well as the ability to enhance returns and are governed by the plan's derivatives policy that was approved by the PBMC.",

        "page_content": "## Liquidity risk\n\nLiquidity risk is the risk of having insufficient cash or its equivalent in a timely and cost-effective manner to meet financial obligations as they come due. Common sources of liquidity risk inherent in banking services include unanticipated withdrawals of deposits, the inability to replace maturing debt, credit and liquidity commitments, and additional pledging or other collateral requirements.\n\nOur approach to liquidity risk management supports our business strategy, aligns with our risk appetite and adheres to regulatory expectations.\n\nOur management strategies, objectives and practices are regularly reviewed to align with changes to the liquidity environment, including regulatory, business and/or market developments. Liquidity risk remains within CIBC's risk appetite.\n\n## Governance and management\n\nWe manage liquidity risk in a manner that enables us to withstand a liquidity stress event without an adverse impact on the viability of our operations. Actual and anticipated cash flows generated from on- and off-balance sheet exposures are routinely measured and monitored to ensure compliance with established limits. We incorporate stress testing into the management and measurement of liquidity risk. Stress test results assist with the development of our liquidity assumptions, identification of potential constraints to funding planning, and contribute to the design of our contingency funding plan.\n\nLiquidity risk is managed using the three lines of defence model, and the ongoing management of liquidity risk is the responsibility of the Treasurer, supported by guidance from GALCO.\n\nThe Treasurer is responsible for managing the activities and processes required for measurement and the reporting and monitoring of CIBC's liquidity risk position as the first line of defence.\n\nThe Liquidity and Non-Trading Market Risk group provides independent oversight of the measurement, monitoring and control of liquidity risk, as the second line of defence.\n\nInternal audit is the third line of defence providing reasonable assurance to senior management and the Audit Committee of the Board on the effectiveness of CIBC's governance practices, risk management processes, and internal control as part of its risk-based audit plan and in accordance with its mandate as described in the Internal Audit Charter.\n\nThe GALCO governs CIBC's liquidity risk management, ensuring the liquidity risk management methodologies, assumptions, and key metrics are regularly reviewed and aligned with CIBC's requirements. The Liquidity Risk Management Committee, a subcommittee of GALCO, monitors global liquidity risk and is responsible for ensuring that CIBC's liquidity risk profile is comprehensively measured and managed in alignment with CIBC's strategic direction, risk appetite and regulatory requirements.\n\nThe RMC provides governance through bi-annual review of CIBC's liquidity risk management policy, and recommends liquidity risk tolerance to the Board through the risk appetite statement which is reviewed annually.\n\n## Policies\n\nOur liquidity risk management policy establishes requirements that enable us to meet anticipated liquidity needs in both normal and stressed conditions by maintaining a sufficient amount of available unencumbered liquid assets and diversified funding sources. Branches and subsidiaries possessing unique liquidity characteristics, due to distinct businesses or jurisdictional requirements, maintain local liquidity practices in alignment with CIBC's liquidity risk management policy.\n\nOur pledging policy sets out consolidated limits for the pledging of CIBC's assets across a broad range of financial activities. These limits ensure unencumbered liquid assets are available for liquidity purposes.\n\nWe maintain a detailed global contingency funding plan that sets out the strategies for addressing liquidity shortfalls in emergency and unexpected situations, and delineates the requirements necessary to manage a range of stress conditions, establishes lines of responsibility, articulates implementation, defines escalation procedures, and is aligned to CIBC's risk appetite. In order to reflect CIBC's organizational complexity, regional and subsidiary contingency funding plans are maintained to respond to liquidity stresses unique to the jurisdictions within which CIBC operates, and support CIBC as an enterprise.\n\n## Risk measurement\n\nOur liquidity risk tolerance is defined by our risk appetite statement, which is approved annually by the Board, and forms the basis for the delegation of liquidity risk authority to senior management. We use both regulatory-driven and internally developed liquidity risk metrics to measure our liquidity risk exposure. Internally, our liquidity position is measured using the Liquidity Horizon, which combines contractual and behavioural cash flows to measure the future point in time when projected cumulative cash outflows exceed cash inflows under a combined CIBC-specific and market-wide stress scenario. Expected and potential anticipated inflows and outflows of funds generated from on- and off-balance sheet exposures are measured and monitored on a regular basis to ensure compliance with established limits. These cash flows incorporate both contractual and behavioural on- and off-balance sheet cash flows.\n\nOur liquidity measurement system provides liquidity risk exposure reports that include the calculation of the internal liquidity stress tests and regulatory reporting such as the LCR, NSFR and NCCF. Our liquidity management also incorporates the monitoring of our unsecured wholesale funding position and funding capacity.\n\n## Risk appetite\n\nCIBC's risk appetite statement ensures prudent management of liquidity risk by outlining qualitative considerations and quantitative metrics including the LCR and Liquidity Horizon. Quantitative metrics are measured and managed to a set of limits approved by Risk Management.\n\n## Stress testing\n\nA key component of our liquidity risk management, and complementing our assessments of liquidity risk exposure, is liquidity risk stress testing. Liquidity stress testing involves the application of name-specific and market-wide stress scenarios at varying levels of severity to assess the amount of available liquidity required to satisfy anticipated obligations as they come due. The scenarios model potential liquidity and funding requirements in the event of changes to unsecured wholesale funding and deposit run-off, contingent liquidity utilization, and liquid asset marketability.",

Encumbered liquid assets, composed of assets pledged as collateral and those assets that are deemed restricted due to legal, operational, or other purposes, are not considered as sources of available liquidity when measuring liquidity risk.

Canadian banks are required by OSFI to achieve a minimum LCR value of 100%. We are in compliance with this requirement.\n\nIn accordance with the calibration methodology contained in OSFI's LAR Guideline, we report the LCR to OSFI on a monthly basis. The ratio is calculated as the total of unencumbered HQLA over the total net cash outflows in the next 30 calendar days.\n\nThe LCR's numerator consists of unencumbered HQLA, which follow an OSFI-defined set of eligibility criteria that considers fundamental and market-related characteristics, and the relative ability to operationally monetize assets on a timely basis during a period of stress. Our centrallymanaged liquid asset portfolio includes those liquid assets reported in the HQLA, such as central government treasury bills and bonds, central bank deposits and high-rated sovereign, agency, provincial, and corporate securities. Asset eligibility limitations inherent in the LCR metric do not necessarily reflect our internal assessment of our ability to monetize our marketable assets under stress.\n\nThe ratio's denominator reflects net cash outflows expected in the LCR's stress scenario over the 30-calendar-day period. Expected cash outflows represent LCR-defined withdrawal or draw-down rates applied against outstanding liabilities and off-balance sheet commitments, respectively. Significant contributors to our LCR outflows include business and financial institution deposit run-off, draws on undrawn lines of credit and unsecured debt maturities. Cash outflows are partially offset by cash inflows, which are calculated at OSFI-prescribed LCR inflow rates, and include performing loan repayments and maturing non-HQLA marketable assets.\n\nDuring a period of financial stress, institutions may use their stock of HQLA, thereby falling below 100%, as maintaining the LCR at 100% under such circumstances could produce undue negative effects on the institution and other market participants.\n\nThe LCR is calculated and disclosed using a standard OSFI-prescribed template.\n\n| $ millions, average of the three months ended October 31, 2023   | $

CIBC predominantly operates in major currencies with deep and fungible foreign exchange markets.\n\n## Net stable funding ratio (NSFR)\n\nDerived from the BCBS's Basel III framework and incorporated into OSFI's LAR Guideline, the NSFR standard aims to promote long-term resilience of the financial sector by requiring banks to maintain a sustainable funding profile in relation to the composition of their assets and off-balance sheet activities. Canadian D-SIBs are required to maintain a minimum NSFR value of 100% on a consolidated bank basis. CIBC is in compliance with this requirement.\n\nIn accordance with the calibration methodology contained in OSFI's LAR Guideline, we report the NSFR to OSFI on a quarterly basis. The ratio is calculated as total available stable funding (ASF) over the total required stable funding (RSF).",

        "page_content": "## Management's discussion and analysis\n\nThe numerator consists of the portion of capital and liabilities considered reliable over a one-year time horizon. The NSFR considers longer-term sources of funding to be more stable than short-term funding and deposits from retail and commercial customers to be behaviourally more stable than wholesale funding of the same maturity. In accordance with our funding strategy, key drivers of our ASF include client deposits supplemented by secured and unsecured wholesale funding, and capital instruments.\n\nThe denominator represents the amount of stable funding required based on the OSFI-defined liquidity characteristics and residual maturities of assets and off-balance sheet exposures. The NSFR ascribes varying degrees of RSF such that HQLA and short-term exposures are assumed to have a lower funding requirement than less liquid and longer-term exposures. Our RSF is largely driven by retail, commercial and corporate lending, investments in liquid assets, derivative exposures, and undrawn lines of credit and liquidity.\n\nThe ASF and RSF may be adjusted to zero for certain liabilities and assets that are determined to be interdependent if they meet the NSFRdefined criteria, which take into account the purpose, amount, cash flows, tenor and counterparties among other aspects to ensure the institution is acting solely as a pass-through unit for the underlying transactions. We report, where applicable, interdependent assets and liabilities arising from transactions OSFI has designated as eligible for such treatment in the LAR Guideline.\n\nThe NSFR is calculated and disclosed using an OSFI-prescribed template, which captures the key quantitative information based on liquidity characteristics unique to the NSFR as defined in the LAR Guideline.

        "page_content": "Our NSFR as at October 31, 2023, increased to 118% from 117% in the prior quarter and was comparable with 2022, due to an increase in longterm funding and deposit growth.\n\nCIBC considers the impact of its business decisions on the LCR, NSFR and other liquidity risk metrics that it regularly monitors as part of a robust liquidity risk management function. Variables that can impact the metrics month-over-month include, but are not limited to, items such as wholesale funding activities and maturities, strategic balance sheet initiatives, and transactions and market conditions affecting collateral.\n\nReporting of the LCR and NSFR is calibrated centrally by Treasury, in conjunction with the SBUs and other functional groups.\n\n## Funding\n\nWe fund our operations with client-sourced deposits, supplemented with a wide range of wholesale funding.\n\nOur principal approach aims to fund our consolidated balance sheet with deposits primarily raised from personal and commercial banking channels. We maintain a foundation of relationship-based core deposits, whose stability is regularly evaluated through internally developed statistical assessments.\n\nWe routinely access a range of short-term and long-term secured and unsecured funding sources diversified by geography, depositor type, instrument, currency and maturity. We raise long-term funding from existing programs including covered bonds, asset securitizations and unsecured debt.\n\nWe continuously evaluate opportunities to diversify into new funding products and investor segments in an effort to maximize funding flexibility and minimize concentration and financing costs. We regularly monitor wholesale funding levels and concentrations to internal limits consistent with our desired liquidity risk profile.\n\nGALCO and RMC review and approve CIBC's funding plan, which incorporates projected asset and liability growth, funding maturities, and output from our liquidity position forecasting.\n\nThe following table provides the contractual maturity profile of our wholesale funding sources at their carrying values:\n\n| $ millions, as at October 31, 2023            | Less than 1 month   | 1-3  months   | 3-6  months   | 6-12  months   | Less than  1 year total   | 1-2  years   | Over  2 years   | Total       |\n|-----------------------------------------------|---------------------|---------------|---------------|----------------|---------------------------|--------------|-----------------|-------------|\n| Deposits from banks (1)                       | $  4,195  $         | 1,505  $      | 556  $        | 1,299  $       | 7,555  $                  |              | -  $            | -  $  7,555 |\n| Certificates of deposit and commercial paper  | 8,061               | 16,738        | 21,511        | 22,598         | 68,908                    | 69           | -               | 68,977      |\n| Bearer deposit notes and bankers' acceptances | 262                 | 594           | 793           | 831            | 2,480                     | -            | -               | 2,480       |\n| Senior unsecured medium-term notes  (2)       | -                   | 5,492         | 6,157         | 10,081         | 21,730                    | 18,605       | 26,393          | 66,728      |\n| Senior unsecured structured notes             | -                   | 236           | -             | 35             | 271                       | -            | 69              | 340         |\n| Covered bonds/asset-backed securities         |                     |               |               |                |                           |              |                 |             |\n| Mortgage securitization                       | -                   | 529           | 363           | 1,458          | 2,350                     | 1,804        | 9,882           | 14,036      |\n| Covered bonds                                 | -                   | -             | -             | -              | -                         | 3,308        | 28,120          | 31,428      |\n| Cards securitization                          | -                   | -             | 1,047         | -              | 1,047                     | 2,864        | 109             | 4,020       |\n| Subordinated liabilities                      | -                   | -             | -             | 36             | 36                        | -            | 6,447           | 6,483       |\n| Other (3)                                     | -                   | -             | -             | -              | -                         | -            | 8               | 8           |\n|                                               | $  12,518  $        | 25,094  $     | 30,427  $     | 36,338  $      | 104,377  $                | 26,650  $    | 71,028  $       | 202,055     |\n| Of which:                                     |                     |               |               |                |                           |              |                 |             |\n| Secured                                       | $                   | -  $  529  $  | 1,410  $      | 1,458  $       | 3,397  $                  | 7,976  $     | 38,111  $       | 49,484      |\n| Unsecured                                     | 12,518              | 24,565        | 29,017        | 34,880         | 100,980                   | 18,674       | 32,917          | 152,571     |\n|                                               | $  12,518  $        | 25,094  $     | 30,427  $     | 36,338  $      | 104,377  $                | 26,650  $    | 71,028  $       | 202,055     |\n| October 31, 2022                              | $  12,656  $        | 22,453  $     | 29,368  $     | 44,504  $      | 108,981  $                | 17,005  $    | 70,702  $       | 196,688     |\n\nThe following table provides the diversification of CIBC's wholesale funding by currency:\n\n| $ billions, as at October 31   | 2023    | 2023   | 2022    | 2022   |\n|--------------------------------|---------|--------|---------|--------|\n| CAD                            | $ 45.8  | 23 %   | $ 51.2  | 26 %   |\n| USD                            | 113.2   | 56     | 103.0   | 52     |\n| Other                          | 43.1    | 21     | 42.5    | 22     |\n|                                | $ 202.1 | 100 %  | $ 196.7 | 100 %  |\n\nWe manage liquidity risk in a manner that enables us to withstand severe liquidity stress events. Wholesale funding may present a higher risk of run-off in stress situations, and we maintain significant portfolios of unencumbered liquid assets to mitigate this risk. See the 'Liquid assets' section for additional details.\n\nOn October 31, 2023, OSFI announced its decision regarding the May 2023 public consultation on the LAR review for wholesale funding sources with retail-like characteristics, specifically high-interest savings account exchange-traded funds. These changes impacting our LCR and NSFR will be applied in the first quarter of 2024.\n\n## Funding plan\n\nOur funding plan is updated at least quarterly, or in response to material changes in underlying assumptions and business developments. The plan incorporates projected asset and liability growth from our ongoing operations, and the output from our liquidity position forecasting.\n\n## Credit ratings\n\nOur access to and cost of wholesale funding are dependent on multiple factors, among them credit ratings provided by rating agencies. Rating agencies' opinions are based upon internal methodologies, and are subject to change based on factors including, but not limited to, financial strength, competitive position, macroeconomic backdrop and liquidity positioning.",

It includes the potential financial loss due to the failure of organic growth initiatives or failure to respond appropriately to changes in the business environment. For additional details on corporate transactions, see the 'Top and emerging risks' section.\n\nOversight of strategic risk is the responsibility of the ExCo and the Board. At least annually, the CEO outlines the process and presents the strategic business plan to the Board for review and approval. As part of the annual planning process, Risk Management assesses the overall and business unit strategic plans to ensure alignment with our risk appetite. The Board reviews the plan in light of management's assessment of emerging market trends, the competitive environment, potential risks and other key issues.\n\nOne of the tools for measuring, monitoring and controlling strategic risk is attribution of regulatory capital against this risk. Our regulatory capital models include a strategic risk component for those businesses utilizing capital to fund an acquisition or a significant organic growth strategy.\n\n## Operational risk\n\nOperational risk is the risk of loss resulting from people, inadequate or failed internal processes and systems, or from external events. Operational risk is inherent in all CIBC activities and transactions. Failure to manage operational risk can result in direct or indirect financial loss, reputational impact, or regulatory review and penalties. The Operational Risk Management Framework (the Framework) sets out the requirements and roles and responsibilities in managing operational risk at CIBC.\n\n## Governance and Management\n\nOperational risk is managed through the three lines of defence model and articulated in the Operational Risk Management Framework. A strong risk culture and communication between the three lines of defence are important characteristics of effective risk management. All three lines of defence, including all team members are accountable for identifying, managing and mitigating operational risk within the approved Operational Risk Appetite. For further details, see the 'Management of risk - Risk overview' section.\n\nGlobal Operational Risk Management (GORM), as part of Global Operational and Enterprise Risk Management, is responsible for oversight of the enterprise-wide operational risk and control environment globally. To effectively discharge its mandate, GORM establishes frameworks, policies, related procedures and guidelines, and develops tools, systems and processes to enable effective identification, measurement, mitigation, monitoring and reporting of operational risks. GORM is also responsible for determining the level of operational risk capital in compliance with OSFI's guidelines. From a governance perspective, the ORCC, chaired by the Senior Vice-President, GORM, is a forum for senior management, with representation from each of the three lines of defence, to monitor and discuss significant operational risk and control matters. ORCC is a sub-committee of the GRC. The GRC, chaired by the CRO, is a senior management forum for discussion and oversight of risk appetite, risk profile and risk mitigation strategies.",

        "page_content": "## Management's discussion and analysis\n\n## Operational risk management approach\n\nInformation transparency, timely escalation, clear accountability and a robust internal control environment are the principles forming the basis of the Operational Risk Management Framework, which supports and governs the processes of identifying, measuring, mitigating, monitoring, and reporting operational risks. We mitigate operational losses by consistently applying risk-based approaches and employing risk-specific assessment tools. Regular review of our risk governance structure ensures clarity of, and ownership in, key risk areas.\n\n## Risk identification\n\nRisk identification includes the process of assessing, understanding and confirming risks, on Business Unit operations, transactions, change initiatives and emerging risks to ensure operational risks are proactively identified and managed. CIBC's business lines regularly conduct reviews of operational risks inherent in their products, services or processes and assess ways to mitigate and manage them in alignment with CIBC's risk appetite. These reviews include using risk and control self-assessments, audit findings, operational risk scenarios, past internal and external loss events, key risk indicators (KRIs) trends, change initiative risk assessments and in-depth risk reviews to form a holistic operational risk profile for the business lines. Under the three lines of defence model, GORM and relevant Control Groups challenge business lines' risk assessments and mitigation actions.\n\n## Risk measurement\n\nRisk measurement is the quantification of operational risks through operational risk capital calculations, internal loss data collection and analysis, and stress testing to understand potential operational risk exposures.\n\nOperational loss is one of the key operational risk metrics informing us of areas of heightened risk. We collect and analyze internal operational loss event data for themes and trends. The occurrence of a material or potential material loss triggers an investigation to determine the root causes of the incident and the effectiveness of existing mitigating controls, as well as the identification of any additional mitigating actions. Additionally, we monitor the external environment for emerging or potential risks to CIBC. The analysis of material operational risk events is performed by the first line of defence and the outputs of the analysis are subject to formal independent challenge by our second line of defence. The analysis of material operational risk events forms one component of our ongoing operational risk reporting to senior management and the Board.\n\nA robust risk measurement practice is in place to quantify operational risk and ensure adequate capital. We use the standardized method to quantify our operational risk exposure in the form of operational risk regulatory capital, as agreed with local regulators.\n\n## Risk mitigation\n\nRisk mitigation is the determination of appropriate strategies and development of action plans to address operational risks to ensure residual risks are within the CIBC risk appetite. Our primary tool for mitigating operational risk exposure is a robust internal control environment. Our Control Framework outlines key principles, structure and processes underpinning our approach to managing risks through effective controls. Under our framework, all key controls are subject to ongoing testing and review to ensure they effectively mitigate our operational risk exposures. In addition, our corporate insurance program may afford additional protection from loss while our global business continuity and broader operational resilience programs enable us to deliver critical services to our clients through disruption.\n\n## Risk monitoring and reporting\n\nRisk monitoring and reporting ensures that operational risk issues, including emerging risks, are monitored and communicated to the relevant stakeholders in a timely and transparent manner.\n\nBoth forward-looking KRIs as well as backward-looking key performance indicators provide insight into our risk exposure and are used to monitor the main drivers of exposure associated with key operational risks and their adherence to the operational risk appetite. KRIs assist in early detection of potential operational risk events by identifying unfavourable trends and highlighting controls that may not be designed or operating effectively. Business lines are required to identify and implement KRIs for material risk exposures on an ongoing basis. Escalation triggers are used to highlight risk exposures requiring additional attention from senior management and/or the Board. The second line of defence challenges the selection of KRIs and the appropriateness of thresholds.\n\nOur risk monitoring processes support a transparent risk-reporting program, informing both senior management and the Board of our control environment, operational risk exposures, and mitigation strategies. Operational risk practices are continuously enhanced to increase robustness of the operational risk management program for effective and efficient identification, measurement, mitigation, monitoring and reporting of operational risks in CIBC.\n\nOperational risks which may adversely impact CIBC include the following:\n\n## Anti-money laundering/anti-terrorist financing\n\nThe risk of CIBC's potential non-conformance with global AML and ATF regulatory requirements and sanctions regulations leading to enhanced regulatory scrutiny, regulatory censure (i.e., cease and desist orders) and/or financial loss (i.e., regulatory, criminal or civil penalties and/or forfeiture of assets). See the 'Top and emerging risks - Anti-money laundering, anti-terrorist financing and sanctions' section for further details.\n\n## Fraud risk\n\nThe risk relating to the intentions to defraud, misappropriate property/assets or circumvent regulations, the law or CIBC policy and can be committed by either employees or by outsiders such as clients or third parties.\n\n## Information security risk (including cyber security)\n\nThe risk to the confidentiality, integrity and availability of CIBC-owned information, and the information entrusted to CIBC by clients, employees, shareholders, business partners, and third parties that if leaked, accessed without authorization or lost, could cause damage to CIBC's business and its customers. See the 'Top and emerging risks - Technology, information and cyber security risk' section for further details.\n\n## Technology risk\n\nThe risk of compromised availability, degradation, recovery, capacity, performance, integrity of new or existing systems. See the 'Top and emerging risks - Technology, information and cyber security risk' section for further details.",

    {
        "page_content": "## Third party risk\n\nThe potential risk that may arise from relying on a third party business arrangement between CIBC and another entity, by contract or otherwise. This includes activities that involve outsourced products and services, use of outside consultants, networking arrangements, managed services, services provided by affiliates and subsidiaries, joint ventures, sponsorships, no-fee contracts, and any other arrangement that involves the delivery of business activities, functions or processes to CIBC and/or its clients. See the 'Top and emerging risks - Third-party risk' section for further details.\n\nOther operational risks include business interruption risk, data risk, conduct risk (see the 'Conduct risk' section), financial reporting risk, legal risk (see the 'Reputation and legal risks' section), model risk, people risk, privacy risk, project risk, physical security and safety risk, regulatory compliance risk (see the 'Regulatory compliance risk' section) and transaction processing and execution risk.\n\n## Environmental and social risk\n\nEnvironmental risk is the risk of financial loss or damage to reputation associated with environmental issues, including but not limited to climaterelated issues (see the 'Top and emerging risks - Climate risk' section for additional details), whether arising from our credit and investment activities or related to our own operations. Social risk is the potential for negative impact on our financial position, operations, legal and regulatory compliance, or reputation stemming from social considerations associated with CIBC, an activity, transaction, product, client, third-party or supplier. These social considerations include, but are not limited to inclusive banking (e.g., accessibility, reconciliation, racial equity), human rights (e.g., modern slavery, including forced labour and child labour, human trafficking), and social impacts related to climate change.\n\n## Governance\n\nIn 2023, we developed the Global Environmental and Social Framework, an internal policy document that provides an overview of how CIBC sets and operationalizes its ESG strategy and related policies, including how we manage environmental and social risks, as well as outlining the established ESG governance framework. As environmental and social risk management requires a multi-disciplinary approach, these risk factors are considered in our ESG governance framework, which outlines responsibilities for ESG from the Board to executive management and down to those with day-to-day accountability for execution.\n\nCIBC's Board and its committees provide ongoing oversight of the continued execution of our bank-wide ESG governance framework, each playing a distinct, but integrated role. The Corporate Governance Committee leads oversight of the execution of our ESG strategy, material public ESG disclosure and stakeholder engagement, and our overall ESG governance framework, and in this capacity considers external challenges, trends and developments that should be incorporated in our strategic plans. Other Board committees lead the oversight of specific elements of our ESG strategy and governance based on mandate, and as it pertains to environmental and social risks; in particular, the Risk Committee supervises key frameworks related to CIBC's principal business risks, which include climate-related risks, and the Audit Committee has oversight of the underlying processes and controls to ensure the integrity, accuracy and reliability of material ESG disclosures.\n\nAt the senior management level, our Executive Committee is accountable for the progress on CIBC's ESG agenda, and the Executive VicePresident and Chief Legal Officer (CLO) is the executive lead for ESG across the enterprise, which includes leading our ESG strategy, ESG disclosure and the execution of our ESG governance framework. In this capacity, the CLO also works closely with our CRO, who has overall responsibility for enterprise risk management. Executive management of ESG is also facilitated through CIBC's Senior Executive ESG Council, which is chaired by the CLO, and has representation from all SBUs and functional groups, enabling bank-wide input and coordination on strategic ESG initiatives in response to CIBC's environmental and social responsibilities. Our Enterprise ESG team, which reports to the CLO, and is led by the Senior Vice-President, ESG and Corporate Governance, works alongside the SBUs, functional groups and ESG subject matter experts across the bank, such as the Environmental Risk Management team within Global Operational and Enterprise Risk Management, to advance CIBC's ESG agenda.\n\nUnderstanding that environmental and social topics and related risks are evolving, we have regular, two-way engagement with our stakeholders and continuously assess and engage on other environmental and social issues through partnerships and industry initiatives. This helps to ensure that we have a common understanding of this risk area and are prepared to respond. Beyond the risks listed below, we are learning and contributing to emerging topics such as biodiversity, through participation in the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures and helping to transform financial decision making to better integrate risks posed by environmental and social issues through participation in A4S (Accounting for Sustainability).\n\n## Risk management\n\nThe Global Environmental and Social Framework outlines roles and responsibilities for risk management of environmental and social risks as a shared responsibility between multiple risk management teams including Global Operational and Enterprise Risk Management, Conduct and Culture Risk Management, and Third Party Risk Management, in addition to regional risk management teams.\n\nWithin CIBC's Risk Management function, the Global Operational and Enterprise Risk Management group provides independent oversight of the measurement, monitoring and control of environmental risks. This group is led by the Executive Vice-President, Global Operational and Enterprise Risk Management, who has direct accountability to the CRO for environmental risk oversight. This team works closely with the Enterprise ESG team, to ensure that environmental and social risks are integrated into our ESG strategy, as well as with the SBUs and functional groups to ensure that best practices of environmental responsibility are applied to the banking services that we provide to our clients, the relationships we have with our stakeholders, and to the way we manage our facilities.\n\nEnvironmental risk, including but not limited to climate-related issues, and social risk are components of reputation and legal risks. These risks are therefore assessed and mitigated according to the policies and related procedures followed for managing reputation and legal risks, including through the Reputation Risk Management Framework, Global Reputation and Legal Risks Policy and business-specific procedures. See the 'Reputation and legal risks' section for additional information.\n\nIn addition, our Corporate Environmental Policy, which is under the overall management of the Environmental Risk Management team, describes our approach to prudent environmental management, including climate-related issues, and assigns responsibilities for managing our environmental impacts. Our Corporate Environmental Policy states that CIBC will develop, implement and maintain standards and procedures to review, assess and manage the environmental risks inherent in lending and investment activities and seek through such activities to promote sound environmental management practices among those with whom business is conducted. For example, environmental and social evaluations are integrated into our credit risk assessment processes, with standards and procedures in place for all sectors. In addition, environmental and social risk assessments in project finance, project-related corporate loans and bridge loans are required, in accordance with our commitment as a signatory to the Equator Principles (adopted in 2003), which are a voluntary set of guidelines for financial institutions based on the screening criteria from the International Finance Corporation. An escalation process is in place for transactions with the potential to have significant environmental and related social risk, with escalation up to the Reputation and Legal Risks Committee for senior executive review, if required.",

        "page_content": "Some social risks, such as child labour or human rights violations, are components of third party risk management and are identified, assessed, mitigated, monitored and reported as per CIBC's Third Party Risk Management Policy (see the 'Top and emerging risks - Third-party risk' section), as well as through our Supplier Code of Conduct (see the 'Human rights and codes of conduct' section).\n\n## Climate change\n\nClimate risk is integrated into our risk management processes, beginning with our climate-related risk appetite, which is defined based on qualitative and quantitative considerations and reflects our guiding principle of practicing sound risk management, as well as enabling us to address stakeholders' expectations with respect to climate risk management. Tolerance levels have been implemented into our Risk Appetite Statements regionally and enterprise-wide for relevant SBUs. We continue to evaluate relevant metrics and will include additional quantitative measures to our Risk Appetite Statements, as needed, as climate-related risk management practices evolve and mature.\n\nWe are actively identifying and assessing climate-related risks and how they might impact business operations, cause physical damage, disrupt supply chains and affect global economies, and ultimately impact credit and market risk. To do this, we are continuing to develop a suite of tools including carbon risk scoring, heat maps, scenario analysis and measuring financed emissions to give us insights into the risks at a client, sector and portfolio level, as there is not one individual tool that can adequately measure the risks that our clients face due to climate change.\n\nOur carbon risk scoring considers the short, medium and long-term impacts that a corporate or commercial client might face due to climate change such as policy, technology and market shifts. It allows us to score each client on a scale of advanced to poor, referring those clients that score poorly to our High Carbon Score Committee, made up of representatives from the relevant SBUs and risk management, to develop appropriate action plans to mitigate the risk.\n\nOur heat map approach also provides a visual representation of the business and government sectors that are vulnerable to climate-related risks. Based on this heat map assessment, we assign a score to each industry and sector within our portfolio based on general exposure to physical and transition risks. The combined weighted average score is used to infer potential credit migrations, which is used as an input into scenario analysis to estimate potential changes in PD, expected loss and RWA. The latter is based on the Bank of Canada and OSFI pilot scenario and provides a useful 'what-if' framework to explore how climate-related risks may manifest in the future.\n\nThese risk management tools provide us with a higher level of granularity to understand how our individual portfolios behave with regard to climate-related risks and where to focus mitigation efforts, as well as informing business decisions towards potential opportunities and areas where we can support our clients. We will continue expanding our knowledge and exploring and assessing climate-related risk impacts as industry standards, the regulatory environment, data quality, tools and our approach mature.\n\n## Human rights and codes of conduct\n\nCIBC is committed to respecting human rights and stands against slavery and human trafficking throughout our business and supply chains. We uphold human rights by incorporating global best practices enterprise-wide, including those embodied by the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, and promoting a fair, diverse and inclusive work environment. We publicly report under the United Kingdom Modern Slavery Act 2015 and the Australian Modern Slavery Act 2018 . We comply with all applicable human rights laws and standards in the jurisdictions in which we operate, including laws addressing issues such as forced and child labour, modern slavery and human trafficking, pay equity, employment equity, health and safety, discrimination and harassment. We expect our team members, clients, suppliers and other third parties with whom we have a business relationship to share our commitment to respect human rights. More information can be found in the CIBC on Human Rights: Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking Statement, which is available on our website.\n\nCIBC's Code of Conduct is an important reference point in our culture and also lays out the standards we have in place for how team members should behave and treat our clients, communities and fellow team members. The Code of Conduct sets out underlying policies that guide our actions and that are foundational to our purpose-led and inclusive culture as we grow in a sustainable way. This includes acting with honesty, integrity and respect. To maintain appropriate conduct and address inappropriate conduct, we use an integrated framework of programs, standards, policies, guidelines and procedures that all align with the high-level principles and ethical standards set out in our Code of Conduct. See the 'Conduct risk' section for additional information.\n\nOur Supplier Code of Conduct sets out the principles, standards and behaviours that our suppliers should follow, as we expect that they act ethically and adhere to all applicable laws, rules and regulations, such as maintaining responsible labour practices and human rights, in the jurisdictions in which they operate. We have procedures in place to assess supplier risk and to govern our contracted supplier relationships. Due diligence reviews of new, existing and prospective suppliers require consideration of applicable ESG factors in order to mitigate these potential risks within our supply chain.\n\nMore information on our ESG governance, policy, management and performance can be found in our Sustainability Report, which is available on our website.\n\n## Regulatory compliance risk\n\nRegulatory compliance risk is the risk of CIBC's potential non-conformance with applicable regulatory requirements.\n\nOur approach to managing and mitigating regulatory compliance risk aligns with CIBC's Risk Appetite Statement  and centers around fostering a robust risk culture. The foundation of this approach is a comprehensive Regulatory Compliance Management (RCM) framework. The RCM framework, owned by the Senior Vice-President, Chief Compliance and Privacy Officer and Global Regulatory Affairs, and approved by the RMC, maps regulatory requirements to our internal policies, procedures and/or controls that govern regulatory compliance.\n\nOur Compliance department is responsible for developing and maintaining a comprehensive regulatory compliance program, including oversight of the RCM framework. This department operates independently from business management and regularly reports to the RMC.\n\nThe primary responsibility for complying with all applicable regulatory requirements rests with senior management of the business and functional groups, and extends to all employees. The Compliance department's activities support these groups, with a particular focus on regulatory requirements that govern the relationship between CIBC and its clients.\n\nSee the 'Regulatory developments' section for further details.",

        "page_content": "## Insurance risk\n\nInsurance risk is the risk of loss arising from the obligation to pay out benefits and expenses on insurance policies in excess of expected amounts. Unfavourable actual experience could emerge due to adverse fluctuations in timing, size and frequency of actual claims (e.g., mortality, morbidity), policyholder behaviour (e.g., cancellation of coverage), or associated expenses.\n\nInsurance contracts provide financial compensation to the beneficiary in the event of an insured risk occurring in exchange for premiums. We are exposed to insurance risk in our insurance business and in our reinsurance business within the respective subsidiaries.\n\nSenior management of the insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries have primary responsibility for managing insurance risk with oversight by Risk Management. The insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries also have their own boards of directors, and an independent Appointed Actuary who provide additional input to risk management oversight. Processes and oversight are in place to manage the risk to our insurance business. Underwriting risk on business assumed is managed through risk policies that limit exposure to an individual life, to certain types of business and to regions.\n\nOur risk governance practices ensure strong independent oversight and control of risk within the insurance businesses. The subsidiaries' boards outline the internal risk and control structure to manage insurance risk, which includes risk, capital and control policies, processes as well as limits and governance. Senior management of the insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries and Risk Management attend the subsidiaries' board meetings.\n\n## Reputation and legal risks\n\nOur reputation and financial soundness are of fundamental importance to us and to our clients, shareholders, third parties, regulators, team members and communities.\n\nReputation risk is the risk of negative publicity regarding our business conduct or practices which, whether true or not, could significantly harm our reputation as a leading financial institution, or could materially and adversely affect our business, operations or financial condition.\n\nLegal risk is the risk of financial loss arising from one or more of the following factors: (a) civil, criminal or regulatory enforcement proceedings against us; (b) our failure to correctly document, enforce or comply with contractual obligations; (c) failure to comply with our legal obligations to clients, investors, team members, counterparties or other stakeholders; (d) failure to take appropriate legal measures to protect our assets or security interests; or (e) misconduct by our team members or agents.\n\nAll team members at CIBC play an important role in protecting our reputation by ensuring that the highest ethical standards are followed in how we act and what we do. Not only must we act with integrity at all times, we must also ensure that activities being conducted do not pose undue risks to CIBC's reputation for ethical, sound and responsible business practices. As a result, requirements for the management and oversight of potential reputation risk are integrated throughout our framework of policies and related procedures. These processes include the management of various risks as set out in CIBC's Risk Appetite Statement, Risk Management Framework and Code of Conduct. Our Reputation Risk Management Framework, Global Reputation and Legal Risks Policy and business-specific procedures outline how we safeguard our reputation through identification, assessment, escalation and mitigation of potential reputation and legal risks. Proactive management of potential reputation and legal risks is a key responsibility of CIBC and all our team members.\n\nOverall governance and oversight of reputation risk is provided by the Board, primarily through the RMC of the Board. Senior management oversight of reputation and legal risks is provided by the Reputation and Legal Risks Committee, which is a sub-committee of GRC and reports its activities regularly to the GRC. Additionally, there are specific senior management committees across the enterprise that provide further oversight to ensure required practices are followed and any material reputation and legal risks are identified, managed, and if required, escalated, effectively.\n\n## Conduct risk\n\nConduct risk is the risk that the actions or omissions (i.e., behaviour) of CIBC, team members or third parties: do not align with our desired culture and values; deliver poor or unfair outcomes for clients, team members or shareholders; result in adverse market practices and outcomes; impact CIBC's reputation as a leading financial institution; or materially and adversely affect our business, operations or financial condition.\n\nOur Conduct and Culture Risk Framework applies enterprise-wide and outlines the proactive management and oversight of potential conduct risk. Every team member is accountable for the identification and management of conduct risk. The overarching principles and requirements for maintaining appropriate conduct and addressing inappropriate conduct are covered in the CIBC Code of Conduct (the Code) and other global, regional and business specific policies, frameworks, processes and procedures. All team members must abide by the Code, and CIBC policies, frameworks, processes and procedures in carrying out the accountabilities of their role. Overall governance of conduct risk is provided by the Board and its committees, including the CGC, as well as senior management committees.",

        "page_content": "## Accounting and control matters\n\n## Critical accounting policies and estimates\n\nThe consolidated financial statements of CIBC have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). These consolidated financial statements also comply with Section 308(4) of the Bank Act (Canada) and the requirements of OSFI. A summary of significant accounting policies is presented in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nCertain accounting policies require us to make judgments and estimates, some of which relate to matters that are uncertain. The current macroeconomic environment, including the impact of higher levels of interest rates, inflation, events in the U.S. banking sector and geopolitical events, gives rise to heightened uncertainty as it relates to our accounting estimates and assumptions and increases the need to apply judgment. In particular, changes in the judgments and estimates related to IFRS 9 can have a significant impact on the level of ECL allowance recognized and period-over-period volatility of the provision for credit losses. Changes in the judgments and estimates required in the critical accounting policies discussed below could have a material impact on our financial results. We have established control procedures to ensure accounting policies are applied consistently and processes for changing methodologies are well controlled.\n\n## Use and classification of financial instruments\n\nAs a financial institution, our assets and liabilities primarily comprise financial instruments, which include deposits, securities, loans, derivatives, acceptances, repurchase agreements, and subordinated indebtedness.\n\nWe use these financial instruments for both trading and non-trading activities. Trading activities primarily include the purchase and sale of securities and metals, transacting in foreign exchange and derivative instruments in the course of facilitating client trades and taking proprietary trading positions with the objective of income generation. Non-trading activities generally include the business of lending, investing, funding, and ALM.\n\nThe use of financial instruments may either introduce or mitigate exposures to market, credit and/or liquidity risks. See the 'Management of risk' section for details on how these risks are managed.\n\nFinancial instruments are accounted for according to their classification. Judgment is applied in determining the appropriate classification of financial instruments under IFRS 9, in particular as it relates to the assessment of whether debt financial assets meet the solely payment of principal and interest (SPPI) test, and the assessment of the business model used to manage financial assets. For details on the accounting for these instruments under IFRS 9, see Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Determination of fair value of financial instruments\n\nUnder IFRS 9, debt and equity securities mandatorily measured and designated at FVTPL, business and government loans mandatorily measured and designated at FVTPL, obligations related to securities sold short, derivative contracts, FVOCI securities and FVO financial instruments are carried at fair value. FVO financial instruments include certain debt securities, certain secured borrowings, obligations related to securities sold under repurchase agreements, structured deposits and business and government deposits. Certain retail mortgage interest rate commitments are also designated as FVO financial instruments.\n\nIFRS 13 defines fair value to be the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability at the measurement date in an orderly arm's-length transaction between market participants in the principal market under current market conditions (i.e., the exit price). Fair value measurements are categorized into levels within a fair value hierarchy based on the nature of the valuation inputs (Level 1, 2 or 3). We have an established and documented process for determining fair value. Fair value is based on unadjusted quoted prices in an active market for the same instrument, where available (Level 1). If active market prices or quotes are not available for an instrument, fair value is then based on valuation models in which the significant inputs are observable (Level 2) or in which one or more of the significant inputs are non-observable (Level 3). Estimating fair value requires the application of judgment. The type and level of judgment required is largely dependent on the amount of observable market information available.\n\nFor instruments valued using internally developed models that use significant non-observable market inputs and are therefore classified within Level 3 of the hierarchy, the judgment used to estimate fair value is more significant than when estimating the fair value of instruments classified within Levels 1 and 2. To ensure that valuations are appropriate, a number of policies and controls are in place, including independent validation of valuation inputs to external sources such as exchange quotes, broker quotes or other management-approved independent pricing sources.\n\nThe following table presents amounts, in each category of financial instruments, which are valued using valuation techniques based on Level 3 inputs. For further details of the valuation of and sensitivity associated with Level 3 financial assets and liabilities, see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n| $ millions, as at October 31                                                                    | 2023     | 2023       | 2022     | 2022       |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|------------|----------|------------|\n|                                                                                                 | Level 3  | Total  (1) | Level 3  | Total  (1) |\n| Assets                                                                                          |          |            |          |            |\n| Securities mandatorily measured and designated at FVTPL and loans mandatorily measured at FVTPL | $  691   | 0.8 %      | $  1,194 | 1.7 %      |\n| Debt securities measured at FVOCI and equity securities designated at FVOCI                     | 191      | 0.3        | 161      | 0.3        |\n| Derivative instruments                                                                          | 71       | 0.2        | 67       | 0.2        |\n|                                                                                                 | $  953   | 0.5 %      | $  1,422 | 0.8 %      |\n| Liabilities                                                                                     |          |            |          |            |\n| Deposits and other liabilities  (2)                                                             | $  242   | 0.7 %      | $  409   | 1.5 %      |\n| Derivative instruments                                                                          | 1,874    | 4.5        | 1,586    | 3.0        |\n|                                                                                                 | $  2,116 | 2.1 %      | $  1,995 | 2.0 %      |",

        "page_content": "Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements presents the valuation methods used to determine fair value showing separately those financial instruments that are carried at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet and those that are not.\n\nIn order to reflect the observed market practice of pricing collateralized and uncollateralized derivatives, our valuation approach uses overnight indexed swap curves as the discount rate in the valuation of collateralized derivatives and market cost of funding in the valuation of uncollateralized derivatives. The use of a market cost of funds curve reduces the fair value of uncollateralized derivative assets incremental to the reduction in fair value for credit risk already reflected through the CVA. In contrast, the use of a market cost of funds curve reduces the fair value of uncollateralized derivative liabilities in a manner that generally includes adjustments for our own credit. As market practices continue to evolve in regard to derivative valuation, further adjustments may be required in the future.\n\n## Fair value adjustments\n\nWe apply judgment in establishing valuation adjustments that take into account various factors that may have an impact on the valuation of financial instruments that are carried at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet. Such factors include, but are not limited to, the bid-offer spread, illiquidity due to lack of market depth and other market risks, parameter uncertainty, model risk, and credit risk.\n\nThe establishment of fair value adjustments involves estimates that are based on accounting processes and judgments by management. We evaluate the adequacy of the fair value adjustments on an ongoing basis. The level of fair value adjustments could change as events warrant and may not reflect ultimate realizable amounts.\n\nAs at October 31, 2023, the total valuation adjustments related to financial instruments carried at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet was $373 million (2022: $326 million), primarily related to credit risk, bid-offer spreads, and parameter uncertainty of our derivative assets and liabilities, as well as adjustments recognized for valuing our uncollateralized derivative assets and liabilities based on an estimated market cost of funds curve.\n\n## Impairment of financial assets\n\nUnder IFRS 9, we establish and maintain ECL allowances for all debt instrument financial assets classified as amortized cost or FVOCI. In addition, the ECL allowances apply to loan commitments and financial guarantees that are not measured at FVTPL.\n\nECL allowances represent credit losses that reflect an unbiased and probability-weighted amount that is determined by evaluating a range of possible outcomes, the time value of money and reasonable and supportable information about past events, current conditions and forecasts of future economic conditions. One of the objectives of IFRS 9 is to record lifetime losses on all financial instruments that have experienced a significant increase in credit risk since their initial recognition. As a result, ECL allowances are measured at amounts equal to either: (i) 12-month ECL; or (ii) lifetime ECL for those financial instruments that have experienced a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition or when there is objective evidence of impairment.\n\n## Key drivers of expected credit loss\n\nThe ECL impairment requirements of IFRS 9 require that we make judgments and estimates related to matters that are uncertain. In particular, the ECL requirements of IFRS 9 incorporate the following elements that are subject to a high level of judgment:\n\n- \u0081 Determining when a significant increase in credit risk of a loan has occurred;\n- \u0081 Measuring both 12-month and lifetime credit losses; and\n- \u0081 Forecasting forward-looking information for multiple scenarios and determining the probability weighting of each scenario.\n\nIn addition, the interrelationship between these elements is also subject to a high degree of judgment. Changes in the judgments and estimates related to IFRS 9 can have a significant impact on the level of ECL allowance recognized and the period-over-period volatility of the provision for credit losses. Changes in a particular period could have a material impact on our financial results.\n\nWe continue to operate in an uncertain macroeconomic environment. During the year ended October 31, 2023, unfavourable credit migration, parameter updates and unfavourable changes in our economic outlook resulted in an increase in our stage 1 and stage 2 performing ECLs. There is inherent uncertainty in estimating the impact that higher levels of interest rates, the easing of inflationary pressures, events in the U.S. banking sector and geopolitical events will have on the macroeconomic environment. As a result, a heightened level of judgment in estimating ECLs in respect of all these elements as discussed above, continued to be required. Actual results could differ from these estimates and assumptions. See Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements for more information concerning the high level of judgment inherent in the estimation of ECL allowance under IFRS 9.\n\n## Use of the regulatory framework\n\nOur ECL models leverage the data, systems and processes that are used to calculate Basel expected loss regulatory adjustments for the portion of our retail and business and government portfolios under the internal ratings-based (IRB) approach. Significant judgment is applied in leveraging the data and modelling techniques used to calculate Basel risk parameters to meet IFRS 9 requirements, including the conversion of through-the-cycle estimates to the point-in-time parameters used under IFRS 9 that consider forward-looking information. In addition, credit losses under IFRS 9 are 12 months for stage 1 financial instruments and lifetime for stage 2 and stage 3 financial instruments, compared to 12 months for IRB portfolios under Basel. The main differences between Basel risk parameters and IFRS 9 parameters are explained in the table below:\n\n|       | Regulatory Capital                                                                                                                         | IFRS 9                                                                                                                                                  |\n|-------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| PD    | Through-the-cycle PD represents long-run average PD  throughout a full economic cycle                                                      | Point-in-time 12-month or lifetime PD based on current conditions  and relevant forward-looking assumptions                                             |\n| LGD   | Downturn LGD based on losses that would be expected in an  economic downturn and subject to certain regulatory floors                      | Unbiased probability-weighted LGD based on estimated LGD  including impact of relevant forward-looking assumptions such as  changes in collateral value |\n|       | Discounted using the cost of capital or opportunity cost                                                                                   | Discounted using the original effective interest rate                                                                                                   |\n| EAD   | Based on the drawn balance plus expected utilization of any  undrawn portion prior to default, and cannot be lower than the  drawn balance | Amortization and repayment of principal and interest from the  balance sheet date to the default date is also captured                                  |\n| Other |                                                                                                                                            | ECL is discounted from the default date to the reporting date                                                                                           |",

However, IFRS 9 allows the existing hedge accounting requirements under IAS 39 to continue in place of the hedge accounting requirements under IFRS 9. As permitted, we previously elected to not adopt the IFRS 9 hedge accounting requirements and instead retained the IAS 39 hedge accounting requirements. As required, we have adopted the hedge accounting disclosure requirements under amendments to IFRS 7 that were effective in 2018. As a result of interest rate benchmark reform, we have adopted 'Interest Rate Benchmark Reform: Amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39 and IFRS 7' (Phase 1 amendments) issued by the IASB as of November 1, 2019, and adopted 'Interest Rate Benchmark Reform: Phase 2 Amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39, IFRS 7, IFRS 4, and IFRS 16' (Phase 2 amendments) as of November 1, 2020. See the 'Other regulatory developments - Interest rate benchmark reform' section for more information.\n\n## Securitizations and structured entities\n\n## Securitization of our own assets\n\nUnder IFRS 10 'Consolidated Financial Statements' (IFRS 10), judgment is exercised in determining whether an investor controls an investee including assessing whether the investor has: (i) power over the investee; (ii) exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee; and (iii) the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee. Power may be exercised through voting or similar rights or, in the case of SEs, through contractual arrangements that direct the relevant activities of the investee. When voting rights are not relevant in deciding whether CIBC has power over an entity, particularly for complex SEs, the assessment of control considers all facts and circumstances, including the purpose and design of the investee, its relationship with other parties and each party's ability to make decisions over significant activities, and whether CIBC is acting as a principal or as an agent.\n\nWe sponsor several SEs that have purchased and securitized our own assets including Cards II Trust, which we consolidate under IFRS 10.\n\nWe also securitize our own mortgage assets through a government-sponsored securitization program. We sell these securitized assets to a government-sponsored securitization vehicle that we do not consolidate, as well as to other third parties. IFRS 9 provides guidance on when to derecognize financial assets. A financial asset is derecognized when the contractual rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired, or when we have transferred the rights to receive cash flows from the asset such that:\n\n- \u0081 We have transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset; or\n- \u0081 We have neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, but have transferred control of the asset.\n\nWe have determined that our securitization activities related to residential mortgages and cards receivables are accounted for as secured borrowing transactions because we have not met the aforementioned criteria.\n\nSecurities lending and repurchase transactions generally do not result in the transfer of substantially all the risks and rewards of the securities and as a result do not result in derecognition of the securities.\n\nWe also sell certain U.S. commercial mortgages to third parties that qualify for derecognition because we have transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the mortgages and have no continuous involvement after the transfer.\n\n## Securitization of third-party assets\n\nWe also sponsor several SEs that purchase pools of third-party assets. We consider a number of factors in determining whether CIBC controls these SEs. We monitor the extent to which we support these SEs, through direct investment in the debt issued by the SEs and through the provision of liquidity protection to the other debtholders, to assess whether we should consolidate these entities.\n\nIFRS 10 also requires that we reconsider our consolidation assessment if facts and circumstances relevant to the entities indicate that there are changes to one or more of the three elements of control described above. Factors that trigger reassessment include, but are not limited to, significant changes in ownership structure of the entities, changes in contractual or governance arrangements, provision of a liquidity facility beyond the original terms, transactions with the entities that were not contemplated originally and changes in the financing structure of the entities.\n\nSpecifically, in relation to our multi-seller conduits, we would reconsider our consolidation assessment if our level of interest in the ABCP issued by the conduits changes significantly, or in the rare event that the liquidity facility that we provide to the conduits is drawn or amended.\n\nA significant increase in our holdings of the outstanding commercial paper issued by the conduits would become more likely in a scenario in which the market for bank-sponsored ABCP suffered a significant deterioration such that the conduits were unable to roll their ABCP.\n\nFor additional information on the securitizations of our own assets and third-party assets, see the 'Financial condition - Off-balance sheet arrangements' section and Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Leases\n\nAs a lessee, we recognize a right-of-use asset and a corresponding lease liability based on the present value of future lease payments, less any lease incentives receivable, when the lessor makes the leased asset available for use to CIBC. We apply judgment in determining the appropriate lease term, which is based on the non-cancellable portion of the lease term, adjusted for any renewal or termination options that are reasonably certain to be exercised. In accounting for the lease, we also determine the appropriate discount rates based on the rate implicit in the lease, if determinable, or on CIBC's incremental borrowing rate.\n\nAs an intermediate lessor, we apply judgment to classify a sublease as an operating or finance sublease based on whether substantially all of the risks and rewards related to the underlying right-of-use asset are transferred to the sub-lessee. If classified as a finance sublease, the related right-of-use asset is derecognized and an investment in sublease is recognized based on the head lease discount rate unless the rate implicit in the sublease is determinable. Where a finance sublease includes lease and non-lease components, we allocate the total consideration in the contract to each component based on our estimation of the standalone prices for each of these components. The investment in sublease is subsequently measured using the effective interest rate method, with interest income recognized over the term of the sublease. Rental income from operating subleases is recognized on a systematic basis over the lease term. For both finance and operating subleases, we apply similar judgments as when we are acting as a lessee to determine the appropriate lease term.",

        "page_content": "## Asset impairment\n\n## Goodwill\n\nAs at October 31, 2023, we had goodwill of $5,425 million (2022: $5,348 million). Goodwill is not amortized, but is tested, at least annually, for impairment by comparing the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit (CGU) to which goodwill has been allocated, with the carrying amount of the CGU including goodwill. Any deficiency is recognized as impairment of goodwill. The recoverable amount of a CGU is defined as the higher of its estimated fair value less cost to sell and its value in use. Goodwill is also required to be tested for impairment whenever there are indicators that it may be impaired.\n\nEstimation of the recoverable amount is an area of significant judgment. Recoverable amounts are estimated using internally developed models that require the use of significant assumptions including forecasted earnings, discount rates, growth rates, forecasted regulatory capital requirements, and price-earnings multiples. Reductions in the estimated recoverable amount could arise from various factors, such as reductions in forecasted cash flows, an increase in the assumed level of required capital, and any adverse changes to the discount rate or terminal growth rates either in isolation or in any combination thereof. Where our estimated recoverable amount is not significantly in excess of the carrying amount of the CGU, additional judgment is required, and reductions in the recoverable amount are more likely to result in an impairment charge.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2023, we performed our annual impairment test. We concluded that the recoverable amounts of our CGUs were in excess of their carrying amounts.\n\nFor additional information, see Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Other intangible assets and long-lived assets\n\nAs at October 31, 2023, we had other intangible assets with an indefinite life of $116 million (2022: $143 million) and with a definite life of $259 million (2022: $358 million). Acquired intangible assets are separately recognized if the benefits of the intangible assets are obtained through contractual or other legal rights, or if the intangible assets can be sold, transferred, licensed, rented, or exchanged. Determining the useful lives of intangible assets requires judgment and fact-based analysis.\n\nIntangible assets with an indefinite life are not amortized but are assessed for impairment by comparing the recoverable amount to the carrying amount. The recoverable amount is defined as the higher of the estimated fair value less cost to sell and value in use. An impairment test is required at least annually, or whenever there are indicators that these assets may be impaired. On October 31, 2023, CIBC FirstCaribbean announced its intent to rebrand as CIBC, and we therefore recognized an impairment charge of $27 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 related to the impairment of the indefinite-lived brand name intangible asset acquired as part of the CIBC FirstCaribbean acquisition.\n\nLong-lived assets and other identifiable intangible assets with a definite life are amortized over their estimated useful lives. These assets are\n\ntested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount is higher than the recoverable amount.\n\nDetermining the recoverable amount of intangible assets and long-lived assets is an area of judgment as we estimate the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and, where appropriate, cash flows arising from the asset's eventual disposition.\n\nFor additional information, see Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Income taxes\n\nWe are committed to responsible tax practices. We exercise active tax governance and tax compliance processes in accordance with the statutory obligations of all jurisdictions in which we operate. We seek to manage tax risk to ensure any financial exposure is well understood and remains consistent with our strategy, overall risk and reputational risk appetite.\n\nWe are subject to income tax laws in the various jurisdictions where we operate, and the complex tax laws are potentially subject to different interpretations by us and the relevant taxation authority. Management judgment is applied in the interpretation of the relevant tax laws and in estimating the expected timing and amount of the provision for current and deferred income taxes based on an assessment of the relevant factors.\n\nCurrent tax is calculated using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted as at the reporting date. For Canadian income taxes, substantively enacted is generally interpreted to occur at the point of a third reading in a Canadian Parliament held by a minority government, or the first reading in a Canadian Parliament held by a majority government.\n\nDeferred tax assets or liabilities are determined for each temporary difference based on the tax rates that are expected to be in effect in the period that the assets are realized or the liabilities are settled, based on the laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted as at the reporting date.\n\nDeferred tax liabilities are not recognized on temporary differences arising on our NIFOs if they are not expected to reverse in the foreseeable future and we expect to control the timing of reversal. Deferred tax assets are not recognized on temporary differences arising on our NIFOs if they are not expected to reverse in the foreseeable future and it is not probable future taxable profits will be available against which these deductible temporary differences can be utilized.\n\nWe assess quarterly the probability that our deferred tax assets will be realized prior to their expiration and determine if any portion of our deferred tax assets should not be recognized.\n\nFor further details on our income taxes, see Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Contingent liabilities and provisions\n\n## Legal proceedings and other contingencies\n\nIn the ordinary course of its business, CIBC is a party to a number of legal proceedings, including regulatory investigations, in which claims for substantial monetary damages are asserted against CIBC and its subsidiaries. Legal provisions are established if, in the opinion of management, it is both probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to resolve the matter, and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. If the reliable estimate of probable loss involves a range of potential outcomes within which a specific amount appears to be a better estimate, that amount is accrued. If no specific amount within the range of potential outcomes appears to be a better estimate than any other amount, the mid-point in the range is accrued. In some instances, however, it is not possible to determine whether an obligation is probable or to reliably estimate the amount of loss, in which case no accrual can be made.\n\nWhile there is inherent difficulty in predicting the outcome of legal proceedings, based on current knowledge and in consultation with legal counsel, we do not expect the outcome of these matters, individually or in aggregate, to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements. However, the outcome of these matters, individually or in aggregate, may be material to our operating results for a particular reporting period. We regularly assess the adequacy of CIBC's litigation accruals and make the necessary adjustments to incorporate new information as it becomes available.\n\nCIBC considers losses to be reasonably possible when they are neither probable nor remote. It is reasonably possible that CIBC may incur losses in addition to the amounts recorded when the loss accrued is the mid-point of a range of reasonably possible losses, or the potential loss pertains to a matter in which an unfavourable outcome is reasonably possible but not probable.\n\nA description of significant ongoing matters to which CIBC is a party can be found in Note 22 to the consolidated financial statements. The provisions disclosed in Note 22 include all of CIBC's accruals for legal matters as at October 31, 2023, including amounts related to the significant legal proceedings described in that note and to other legal matters.",

        "page_content": "CIBC believes the estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses, in excess of the amounts accrued, for its significant legal proceedings, where it is possible to make such an estimate, is from nil to approximately $0.6 billion as at October 31, 2023. This estimated aggregate range of reasonably possible losses is based upon currently available information for those significant proceedings in which CIBC is involved, taking into account CIBC's best estimate of such losses for those cases for which an estimate can be made. CIBC's estimate involves significant judgment, given the varying stages of the proceedings and the existence of multiple defendants in many of such proceedings whose share of the liability has yet to be determined. The range does not include potential punitive damages. The matters underlying the estimated range as at October 31, 2023, consist of the significant legal matters disclosed in Note 22 to the consolidated financial statements. The matters underlying the estimated range will change from time to time, and actual losses may vary significantly from the current estimate. For certain matters, CIBC does not believe that an estimate can currently be made as many of them are in preliminary stages and certain matters have no specific amount claimed. Consequently, these matters are not included in the range.\n\n## Post-employment and other long-term benefit plan assumptions\n\nWe sponsor a number of benefit plans to eligible employees, including registered and supplemental pension plans, and post-retirement medical and dental plans (other post-employment benefit plans). We also continue to sponsor long-term disability medical and dental benefit plans (collectively, other long-term benefit plans). The long-term disability income replacement plan that was previously closed to new claims as of June 2004, was settled effective December 2021.\n\nThe calculation of net defined benefit plan expense and obligations depends on various actuarial assumptions such as discount rates, healthcare cost trend rates, turnover of employees, projected salary increases, retirement age, and mortality rates. The actuarial assumptions used for determining the net defined benefit plan expense for a fiscal year are set at the beginning of the annual reporting period, are reviewed in accordance with accepted actuarial practice and are approved by management. We applied additional judgment in developing salary-related assumptions for the year ended October 31, 2023 given the impact of inflationary pressures on employee compensation and our public commitments to additional wage increases for certain employees.\n\nThe discount rate assumption used in measuring the net defined benefit plan expense and obligations reflects market yields, as of the measurement date, on high-quality debt instruments with a currency and term to maturity that match the currency and expected timing of benefit payments. Our discount rate is estimated by developing a yield curve based on high-quality corporate bonds. While there is a deep market of highquality corporate bonds denominated in Canadian dollars with short and medium terms to maturity, there is not a deep market in bonds with terms to maturity that match the timing of all the expected benefit payments for all of our Canadian plans. As a result, for our Canadian pension, other post-employment and other long-term benefit plans, we estimate the yields of high-quality corporate bonds with longer-term maturities by extrapolating current yields on bonds with short- and medium-term durations along the yield curve. Judgment is required in constructing the yield curve, and as a result, different methodologies applied in constructing the yield curve can give rise to different discount rates.\n\nFor further details of our annual pension and other post-employment expense and obligations, see Note 1 and Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Self-managed loyalty points program\n\nWe sponsor certain self-managed credit card loyalty points programs for which we recognize credit card loyalty point liabilities that are subject to periodic remeasurement to reflect the expected cost of redemption as this expectation changes over time. The calculation of the expected cost of redemption requires the use of judgment and depends on various assumptions, including estimation of the cost per point and the long-term redemption rate.\n\nFor further details on our self-managed loyalty points programs, see Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Accounting developments Transition to IFRS 17\n\nIFRS 17 'Insurance Contracts' (IFRS 17), issued in May 2017, replaces IFRS 4 'Insurance Contracts' (IFRS 4). In June 2020, the IASB issued amendments to IFRS 17 partly aimed at helping companies implement the standard. IFRS 17, incorporating the amendments, is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2023, which for us will be November 1, 2023. IFRS 17 provides comprehensive guidance on the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of insurance contracts we issue and reinsurance contracts we hold. IFRS 17 requires groups of insurance contracts to be established and measured on the basis of fulfilment cash flows using the measurement models outlined by the standard. Insurance contracts under the General Measurement Model (GMM) are measured based on the present value of fulfilment cash flows, a risk adjustment for non-financial risks, and a contractual service margin (CSM) representing our unearned profits on a portfolio basis, further disaggregated into profitability groups. We expect to apply GMM to our insurance contracts with contract boundaries exceeding a year. Contracts under the Premium Allocation Approach (PAA) are measured on the basis of premiums received and related cash flows. We expect to apply the PAA measurement model to our insurance contracts with contract boundaries shorter than a year. Under both measurement models, the liability for incurred claims is measured on the basis of fulfilment cash flows relating to claims incurred. Key differences between IFRS 4 and IFRS 17 which are applicable to CIBC include the following:\n\n- \u0081 Under IFRS 4, gains or losses from new business are recognized immediately. Under IFRS 17, gains from new business are deferred and recognized over time as insurance services are provided. If a group of contracts is expected to be onerous at initial recognition or turns onerous subsequently, the losses will be recognized immediately.\n- \u0081 Under IFRS 4, the discount rate used to measure the insurance contract liability is determined on the basis of the assets supporting the insurance liability. Under IFRS 17, the discount rate used to measure the insurance contracts issued and reinsurance held is based upon the characteristics of the insurance contract.\n\nWe expect to adopt IFRS 17 retrospectively for the fiscal year beginning November 1, 2023, with a restatement of the 2023 comparative period. The after-tax reduction to retained earnings is expected to be approximately $55 million at the beginning of the comparative year as of November 1, 2022.\n\nThe implementation of IFRS 17 is overseen by an Executive Steering Committee. The Executive Steering Committee includes stakeholders from the frontline business and functional groups including Finance, Technology and Risk Management as well as our Appointed Actuary. We have completed our evaluation of changes to our accounting and actuarial policies resulting from the adoption of IFRS 17 and have implemented a technology solution to support the new accounting requirements.\n\n## International Tax Reform Pillar Two Model Rules - Amendments to IAS 12\n\nOn May 23, 2023, the IASB issued 'International Tax Reform - Pillar Two Model Rules', which amended IAS 12 'Income Taxes' (IAS 12), to provide temporary relief from the accounting and disclosure for deferred taxes arising from the implementation of Pillar Two model rules published by the OECD. The Pillar Two model rules provide a general framework for the implementation of a 15% global minimum tax, which is to be applied on a jurisdiction by",

        "page_content": "jurisdiction basis. CIBC has retrospectively adopted this amendment and applied the exception to recognizing and disclosing deferred taxes related to Pillar Two income taxes. Further amendments require certain additional disclosures on Pillar Two income tax exposures as of CIBC's fiscal year beginning November 1, 2023.\n\n## Other regulatory developments Interest rate benchmark reform\n\nVarious interest rate and other indices that are deemed to be 'benchmarks' (including LIBOR) are the subject of international regulatory guidance and proposals for reform. Regulators in various jurisdictions have pushed for the transition from Interbank Offered Rates (IBORs) to alternative benchmark rates (alternative rates), based upon risk-free rates determined using actual market transactions. Following the previous announcements by various regulators, the publication of LIBOR settings for all sterling, Japanese yen, Swiss franc and euro, as well as 1-week and 2-month USD LIBOR settings was discontinued on December 31, 2021. The publication of remaining USD LIBOR settings was discontinued on June 30, 2023. In December 2021, the Canadian Alternative Reference Rate working group (CARR) recommended to Refinitiv Benchmark Services (UK) Limited (RBSL), the Canadian Dollar Offered Rate (CDOR) administrator, to cease the calculation and publication of CDOR after June 30, 2024 and proposed a two-staged approach to the transition from CDOR to Canadian Overnight Repo Rate Average (CORRA). Following public consultation, on May 16, 2022, RBSL announced that it will permanently cease the publication and calculation of all remaining tenors of CDOR after June 28, 2024. Additionally, in July 2023, CARR announced that no new CDOR or bankers' acceptance (BA) loans are to be originated after November 1, 2023.\n\nIn response to the reforms to interest rate benchmarks, CIBC established an Enterprise IBOR Transition Program (Program), to manage and coordinate all aspects of the transition. The Program is supported by a formal governance structure and dedicated working groups that include stakeholders from frontline businesses as well as functional groups such as Treasury, Technology and Operations, Risk Management, Legal, and Finance, to facilitate the transition.\n\nThe IASB issued amendments to impacted accounting standards to provide relief to entities impacted by the transition to alternative rates. In September 2019, the IASB issued 'Interest Rate Benchmark Reform: Amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39 and IFRS 7' (the Phase 1 amendments), which allow us to continue hedge accounting by assuming that the interest rate benchmarks which are the basis for the hedged risk, the cash flows of the hedged item or the hedging instrument are not altered as a result of the reform. For the bank's cash flow hedges of forecast transactions that are directly impacted by IBOR reform, for the purpose of assessing whether a forecast transaction is highly probable or expected to occur, these amendments allow us to assume that the benchmark interest rate on which the hedged cash flows are based is not altered as a result of IBOR reform. Phase 1 amendments also provide temporary exceptions to allow hedge accounting to continue if a hedge relationship does not meet certain hedge effectiveness assessment criteria solely as a result of IBOR reform.\n\nIn August 2020, the IASB issued 'Interest Rate Benchmark Reform: Phase 2 Amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39, IFRS 7, IFRS 4 and IFRS 16' (the Phase 2 amendments), which address issues once an existing rate is replaced with an alternative rate. The Phase 2 amendments provide temporary relief that allows for hedging relationships to continue upon the replacement of an existing interest rate benchmark with an alternative rate under certain qualifying conditions. These amendments also allow us to redefine the hedged risk to an alternative rate, and to amend the description of the hedged item and the hedging instrument, and the description of how we will assess hedge effectiveness to reflect changes required by the reform without discontinuing the hedge relationship. The Phase 2 amendments also provide temporary relief that allows us to designate an alternative rate as a risk component to hedge provided that we reasonably expect that the alternative rate will become separately identifiable within 24 months of its first designation and also permit modifications of amortized cost financial assets and financial liabilities that are made as a direct consequence of IBOR reform and on an economically equivalent basis to be accounted for by updating the effective interest rate prospectively. The Phase 2 amendments also provide for additional disclosure requirements.\n\nAs we elected to continue to apply the hedge accounting requirements of IAS 39 upon the adoption of IFRS 9, only the amendments to the classification and measurement sections of IFRS 9, the hedge accounting sections of IAS 39, IFRS 7, IFRS 4 and IFRS 16 apply to us. CIBC elected to early adopt the Phase 1 and Phase 2 amendments effective November 1, 2019 and November 1, 2020, respectively. As a result, we have provided additional disclosures related to our exposures to significant benchmark rates subject to the reform in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements.\n\n## OSFI Guideline B-13 - Technology and Cyber Risk Management\n\nOn July 13, 2022, OSFI issued the final Guideline B-13, which will become effective on January 1, 2024. This guideline is new, sets out OSFI's expectations to support FRFIs in developing greater resilience to technology and cyber risks, taking a risk-based approach that allows FRFIs to take advantage of innovation while maintaining sound technology risk management. The Guideline is organized around three domains, each of which sets out key components for sound risk management: Governance and Risk Management, Technology Operations and Resilience, and Cyber Security. Efforts are underway to ensure compliance with the Guideline.\n\n## OSFI Guideline - Assurance on Capital, Leverage and Liquidity Returns\n\nOn November 7, 2022, OSFI issued a Guideline on Assurance on Capital, Leverage and Liquidity Returns, which sets out OSFI's three-step approach to enhancing and aligning assurance expectations over regulatory capital, leverage and liquidity returns, including expectations concerning the role of management, Internal Audit and the external auditors. The Guideline is effective in stages over a three year period beginning in fiscal 2023, including the requirement for an external audit opinion on the numerator and denominator of key regulatory ratios in fiscal 2025.\n\n## OSFI Guideline B-10 - Third-Party Risk Management\n\nOn April 24, 2023, OSFI published the final Guideline B-10, which sets out associated risk management expectations for FRFIs and will become effective on May 1, 2024. The Guideline emphasizes governance and risk management programs associated with effective third-party risk management. Key changes include an expanded scope from outsourcing arrangements to third-party arrangements and a widened risk lens, including subcontracting, concentration, technology and cyber risks. FRFIs are expected to apply this Guideline in a manner that is proportionate to both the risk and criticality of each third-party arrangement, and the size, nature, scope, complexity of operations and risk profile of the FRFI. A detailed readiness assessment is in progress and activities are underway to ensure compliance with requirements by May 1, 2024.\n\n## OSFI Guideline B-15 - Climate Risk Management\n\nOn March 7, 2023, OSFI published the final Guideline B-15, which sets out OSFI's expectations for the management of climate-related risks, and will become effective for D-SIBs for the fiscal periods ending on or after October 1, 2024. For additional information, see the 'Top and emerging risks Climate risk' section.",

        "page_content": "## Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) Special Assessment\n\nOn November 16, 2023, the FDIC Board of Directors approved the final ruling to implement a special assessment on certain insured U.S. depository institutions to recover the cost associated with protecting uninsured depositors following the closures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. The FDIC will impose the special assessment at an annual rate of approximately 13.4 basis points of an insured depository institution's (IDI's) estimated uninsured deposits as of December 31, 2022, adjusted to exclude the first US$5 billion applicable to IDI for an anticipated total of eight quarterly assessment periods. The special assessment will be collected beginning with the first quarterly assessment period of 2024 (i.e., January 1 through March 31, 2024, with an invoice payment date of June 28, 2024). Our U.S. depository institution, CIBC Bank USA, will be subject to this special assessment. The impact of this special assessment for CIBC is estimated to be approximately US$67 million, which will be recognized in the first quarter of 2024.\n\n## Related-party transactions\n\nWe have various processes in place to ensure that the relevant related-party information is identified and reported to the CGC of the Board on a quarterly basis, as required by the Bank Act (Canada). The CGC has the responsibility for reviewing our policies and practices in identifying transactions with our related parties that may materially affect us, and reviewing the associated procedures for promoting compliance with the Bank Act (Canada).\n\nIn the ordinary course of business, we provide banking services and enter into transactions with related parties on terms similar to those offered to unrelated parties. Related parties include key management personnel (1) , their close family members, and entities that they or their close family members control or jointly control. Related parties also include associates and joint ventures accounted for under the equity method, and post-employment benefit plans for CIBC employees. Loans to these related parties are made in the ordinary course of business and on substantially the same terms as for comparable transactions with unrelated parties. We offer a subsidy on annual fees and preferential interest rates on credit card balances to senior officers which is the same offer extended to all employees of CIBC. In addition, CIBC offers deferred share and other plans to non-employee directors, executives, and certain other key employees. Details of our compensation of key management personnel and our investments in equity-accounted associates and joint ventures are disclosed in Notes 17, 18, 24 and 25 to the consolidated financial statements. (1)\n\n## Policy on the Scope of Services of the Shareholders' Auditor\n\nThe 'Policy on the Scope of Services of the Shareholders' Auditor' sets out the parameters for the engagement of the shareholders' auditor by CIBC that are consistent with applicable law, including the U.S. Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and SEC rules. The policy requires the Audit Committee's pre-approval of all work performed by the shareholders' auditor and prohibits CIBC from engaging the shareholders' auditor for 'prohibited' services. The Audit Committee is accountable for the oversight of the work of the shareholders' auditor and for an annual assessment of the engagement team's qualifications, performance and independence, including lead audit partner rotation. The Audit Committee is also responsible for conducting a periodic comprehensive review of the external auditor at least every five years. The Audit Committee's oversight activities over the shareholders' auditor are disclosed in our Management Proxy Circular.\n\n## Controls and procedures\n\n## Disclosure controls and procedures\n\nCIBC's disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that relevant information is accumulated and communicated to CIBC's management, including the President and CEO and the Chief Financial Officer (CFO), to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\n\nCIBC's management, with the participation of the President and CEO and the CFO, has evaluated the effectiveness of CIBC's disclosure controls and procedures as at October 31, 2023 (as defined in the rules of the SEC and the CSA). Based on that evaluation, the President and CEO and the CFO have concluded that such disclosure controls and procedures were effective.\n\n## Management's annual report on internal control over financial reporting\n\nCIBC's management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for CIBC.\n\nInternal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the President and CEO and the CFO and effected by the Board, management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with IFRS as issued by the IASB. CIBC's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records, that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of CIBC; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with IFRS as issued by the IASB, and that receipts and expenditures of CIBC are being made only in accordance with authorizations of CIBC's management and directors; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of CIBC's assets that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.\n\nAll internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations and may not prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.\n\nCIBC's management has used the Internal Control - Integrated Framework that was published in 2013 by the COSO as the basis to evaluate the effectiveness of CIBC's internal control over financial reporting.\n\nAs at October 31, 2023, management assessed the effectiveness of CIBC's internal control over financial reporting and concluded that such internal control was effective.\n\nErnst & Young LLP, the shareholders' auditor, has audited the consolidated financial statements of CIBC for the year ended October 31, 2023, and has also issued a report on internal control over financial reporting under standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).\n\n## Changes in internal control over financial reporting\n\nThere have been no changes in CIBC's internal control over financial reporting during the year ended October 31, 2023, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, its internal control.",

ECL allowances for loans and acceptances are included in Allowance for credit losses on the consolidated balance sheet. ECL allowances for fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) debt securities are included as a component of the carrying value of the securities, which are measured at fair value. ECL allowances for other financial assets are included in the carrying value of the instrument. ECL allowances for guarantees and loan commitments are included in Other liabilities.\n\nAllowance for credit losses are adjusted for provisions for (reversals of) credit losses and are reduced by write-offs, net of recoveries.\n\n## Amortized cost\n\nThe amount at which a financial asset or financial liability is measured at initial recognition minus repayments, plus or minus any unamortized origination date premiums or discounts, plus or minus any basis adjustments resulting from a fair value hedge, and minus any reduction for impairment (directly or through the use of an allowance account). The amount of a financial asset or liability measured at initial recognition is the cost of the financial asset or liability including capitalized transaction costs and deferred fees.\n\n## Assets under administration (AUA)\n\nAssets administered by CIBC that are beneficially owned by clients and are, therefore, not reported on the consolidated balance sheet. The services provided by CIBC are of an administrative nature, such as safekeeping of securities, client reporting and record keeping, collection of investment income, and the settlement of purchase and sale transactions. In addition, assets under management (AUM) amounts are included in the amounts reported under AUA.\n\n## Assets under management (AUM)\n\nAssets managed by CIBC that are beneficially owned by clients and are, therefore, not reported on the consolidated balance sheet. The service provided in respect of these assets is discretionary portfolio management on behalf of the clients.\n\n## Average interest-earning assets\n\nAverage interest-earning assets include interest-bearing deposits with banks, interest-bearing demand deposits with the Bank of Canada, securities, cash collateral on securities borrowed or securities purchased under resale agreements, loans net of allowance for credit losses, and certain sublease-related assets. Average balances are calculated as a weighted average of daily closing balances.\n\n## Average trading interest-earning assets\n\nAverage trading interest-earning assets are average interest-earning assets related to trading activities that meet the risk definition of trading for regulatory capital and trading market risk management purposes. Starting in the first quarter of 2023, trading activities also include certain fixed income financing activities. The risk definition of trading for regulatory capital and trading market risk management is based on OSFI-defined trading book criteria set out in OSFI's CAR Guideline.\n\n## Basis point\n\nOne-hundredth of a percentage point (0.01%).\n\n## Collateral\n\nAssets pledged to secure loans or other obligations, which are forfeited if the obligations are not repaid.\n\n## Collateralized debt obligation (CDO)\n\nSecuritization of any combination of corporate debt, asset-backed securities (ABS), mortgage-backed securities or tranches of other CDOs to form a pool of diverse assets that are tranched into securities that offer varying degrees of risk and return to meet investor demand.\n\n## Collateralized loan obligation (CLO)\n\nSecuritizations of diversified portfolios of corporate debt obligations and/or ABS that are tranched into securities that offer varying degrees of risk and return to meet investor demand.\n\n## Common shareholders' equity\n\nCommon shareholders' equity includes common shares, contributed surplus, retained earnings and accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI).\n\n## Credit derivatives\n\nA category of financial instruments that allow one party (the beneficiary) to separate and transfer the credit risk of nonpayment or partial payment of an underlying financial instrument to another party (the guarantor).\n\n## Credit valuation adjustment (CVA)\n\nA valuation adjustment that is required to be considered in measuring fair value of over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives to recognize the risk that any given derivative counterparty may not ultimately be able to fulfill its obligations. In assessing the net counterparty credit risk (CCR) exposure, we take into account credit mitigants such as collateral, master netting arrangements, and settlements through clearing houses.\n\n## Current replacement cost\n\nThe estimated cost of replacing an asset at the present time according to its current worth.\n\n## Derivatives\n\nA financial contract that derives its value from the performance of an underlying instrument, index or financial rate.",

There is an equivalent offsetting adjustment to the income tax expense.\n\n## Total shareholder return (TSR)\n\nThe total return earned on an investment in CIBC's common shares. The return measures the change in shareholder value, assuming dividends paid are reinvested in additional shares.\n\n## Trading net interest income\n\nTrading net interest income is net interest income related to trading activities that meet the risk definition of trading for regulatory capital and trading market risk management purposes, which includes a TEB adjustment. Starting in the first quarter of 2023, trading activities also include certain fixed income financing activities. The risk definition of trading for regulatory capital and trading market risk management is based on OSFI-defined trading book criteria set out in OSFI's CAR Guideline.",

        "page_content": "## Risk and capital glossary\n\n## Advanced internal ratings-based (AIRB) approach for credit risk\n\nVersion of the internal ratings-based (IRB) approach to credit risk where institutions provide their own estimates of probability of default (PD), loss given default (LGD) and exposure at default (EAD), and their own calculation of effective maturity, subject to meeting minimum standards. Effective in the second quarter of 2023, AIRB is no longer permitted for some exposure categories.\n\n## Asset/liability management (ALM)\n\nThe practice of managing risks that arise from mismatches between the assets and liabilities, mainly in the non-trading areas of the bank. Techniques are used to manage the relative duration of CIBC's assets (such as loans) and liabilities (such as deposits), in order to minimize the adverse impact of changes in interest rates.\n\n## Bail-in eligible liabilities\n\nBail-in eligible liabilities include long-term (i.e., original maturity over 400 days), unsecured senior debt issued on or after September 23, 2018 that is tradable and transferrable, and any preferred shares and subordinated debt that are not considered non-viability contingent capital (NVCC). Consumer deposits, secured liabilities (including covered bonds), certain financial contracts (including derivatives) and certain structured notes are not bail-in eligible.\n\n## Bank exposures\n\nAll direct credit risk exposures to deposit-taking institutions and regulated securities firms, and exposures guaranteed by those entities.\n\n## Business and government portfolio\n\nA category of exposures that includes lending to businesses and governments, where the primary basis of adjudication relies on the determination and assignment of an appropriate risk rating that reflects the credit risk of the exposure.\n\n## Central counterparty (CCP)\n\nA clearing house that interposes itself between counterparties to clear contracts traded in one or more financial markets, becoming the buyer to every seller and the seller to every buyer and thereby ensuring the future performance of open contracts.\n\n## Comprehensive approach for securities financing transactions\n\nA framework for the measurement of CCR with respect to securities financing transactions, which utilizes a volatility-adjusted collateral value to reduce the amount of the exposure.\n\n## Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1), Tier 1 and Total capital ratios\n\nCET1, Tier 1 and total regulatory capital, divided by RWA, as defined by OSFI's Capital Adequacy Requirements (CAR) Guideline, which is based on Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) standards.\n\n## Corporate exposures\n\nAll direct credit risk exposures to corporations, partnerships and proprietorships, and exposures guaranteed by those entities.\n\n## Credit risk\n\nThe risk of financial loss due to a borrower or counterparty failing to meet its obligations in accordance with contractual terms.\n\n## Drawn exposure\n\nThe amount of credit risk exposure resulting from loans and other receivables advanced to the customer.\n\n## Economic capital\n\nEconomic capital provides a framework to evaluate the returns of each strategic business unit, commensurate with risk assumed. Economic capital is a non-GAAP risk measure based upon an internal estimate of equity capital required by the businesses to absorb unexpected losses consistent with our targeted risk rating over a one-year horizon. Economic capital comprises primarily credit, market, operational and strategic risk capital.\n\n## Economic profit\n\nA non-GAAP risk-adjusted performance measure used for measuring economic value added. It is calculated as earnings of each business less a charge for the cost of capital.\n\n## Exposure at default (EAD)\n\nAn estimate of the amount of exposure to a customer at the event of, and at the time of, default.\n\n## Foundation internal ratings-based (FIRB) approach for credit risk\n\nVersion of the IRB approach to credit risk where institutions provide their own estimates of PD and their own calculation of effective maturity and rely on prescribed supervisory estimates for other risk components such as LGD and EAD. Effective in the second quarter of 2023, FIRB methodology must be used for some exposure categories.\n\n## Incremental risk charge (IRC)\n\nA capital charge applied in addition to market risk capital specifically to cover default and migration risk in unsecuritized credit assets of varying liquidity held in the trading book.",

        "page_content": "## Management's discussion and analysis\n\n## Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP)\n\nA framework and process designed to provide a comprehensive view on capital adequacy, as defined by Pillar II of the Basel Accord, wherein we identify and measure our risks on an ongoing basis in order to ensure that the capital available is sufficient to cover all risks across CIBC.\n\n## Internal models approach (IMA) for market risk\n\nModels, which have been developed by CIBC and approved by OSFI, for the measurement of risk and regulatory capital in the trading portfolio for general market risk, debt specific risk, and equity specific risk.\n\n## Internal model method (IMM) for counterparty credit risk (CCR)\n\nModels, which have been developed by CIBC and approved by OSFI, for the measurement of CCR with respect to OTC derivatives.\n\n## Internal ratings-based (IRB) approach for credit risk\n\nApproach to determining credit risk capital requirements based on risk components such as PD, LGD, EAD and effective maturity.\n\n## Internal ratings-based approach for securitization exposures\n\nThis approach comprises calculation methods available for securitization exposures that require OSFI approval: the Internal Ratings-Based Approach (SEC-IRBA) is available to the banks approved to use the IRB approach for underlying exposures securitized and the Internal Assessment Approach (SEC-IAA) available for certain securitization exposures extended to asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP) programs.\n\n## Leverage ratio exposure\n\nThe leverage ratio exposure is defined under the OSFI rules as on-balance sheet assets (unweighted) less Tier 1 capital regulatory adjustments plus derivative exposures, securities financing transaction exposures with a limited form of netting under certain conditions, and other off-balance sheet exposures (such as commitments, direct credit substitutes, undrawn credit card exposures, securitization exposures and unsettled trades).\n\n## Leverage ratio\n\nDefined as Tier 1 capital divided by the leverage ratio exposure determined in accordance with guidelines issued by OSFI, which are based on BCBS standards.\n\n## Liquidity coverage ratio (LCR)\n\nDerived from the BCBS's Basel III framework and incorporated into OSFI's Liquidity Adequacy Requirements (LAR) Guideline, the LCR is a liquidity standard that aims to ensure that an institution has an adequate stock of unencumbered high-quality liquid assets (HQLA) that consists of cash or assets that can be converted into cash at little or no loss of value in private markets, to meet its liquidity needs for a 30-calendar-day liquidity stress scenario.\n\n## Liquidity risk\n\nThe risk of having insufficient cash or its equivalent in a timely and cost-effective manner to meet financial obligations as they come due.\n\n## Loss given default (LGD)\n\nAn estimate of the amount of exposure to a customer that will not be recovered following a default by that customer, expressed as a percentage of the EAD. LGD is generally based on through-the-cycle assumptions for regulatory capital purposes, and generally based on point-in-time assumptions reflecting forward-looking information for IFRS 9 ECL purposes.\n\n## Market risk\n\nThe risk of economic and/or financial loss in our trading and non-trading portfolios from adverse changes in underlying market factors, including interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity market prices, commodity prices, credit spreads and customer behaviour for retail products.\n\n## Master netting agreement\n\nAn industry standard agreement designed to reduce the credit risk of multiple transactions with a counterparty through the creation of a legal right of offset of exposures in the event of a default by that counterparty and through the provision for net settlement of all contracts through a single payment.\n\n## Net cumulative cash flow (NCCF)\n\nThe NCCF is a liquidity horizon metric defined under OSFI's LAR Guideline as a monitoring and supervision tool for liquidity risk that measures an institution's detailed cash flows in order to capture the risk posed by funding mismatches between assets and liabilities.\n\n## Net stable funding ratio (NSFR)\n\nDerived from the BCBS's Basel III framework and incorporated into OSFI's LAR Guideline, the NSFR standard aims to promote long-term resilience of the financial sector by requiring banks to maintain a sustainable stable funding profile in relation to the composition of their assets and off-balance sheet activities.\n\n## Non-viability contingent capital (NVCC)\n\nEffective January 1, 2013, in order to qualify for inclusion in regulatory capital, all non-common Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital instruments must be capable of absorbing losses at the point of non-viability of a financial institution. This will ensure that investors in such instruments bear losses before taxpayers where the government determines that it is in the public interest to rescue a non-viable bank.\n\n## Operational risk\n\nThe risk of loss resulting from people, inadequate or failed internal processes and systems, or from external events.\n\n## Other off-balance sheet exposure\n\nThe amount of credit risk exposure resulting from the issuance of guarantees and letters of credit.",

        "page_content": "## Other retail\n\nThis exposure class includes all loans other than qualifying revolving retail and real estate secured personal lending that are extended to individuals under the regulatory capital reporting framework.\n\n## Over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives exposure\n\nThe amount of credit risk exposure resulting from derivatives that trade directly between two counterparties, rather than through exchanges.\n\n## Probability of default (PD)\n\nAn estimate of the likelihood of default for any particular customer which occurs when that customer is not able to repay its obligations as they become contractually due. PD is based on through-the-cycle assumptions for regulatory capital purposes, and based on point-in-time assumptions reflecting forward-looking information for IFRS 9 ECL purposes.\n\n## Qualifying central counterparty (QCCP)\n\nAn entity that is licensed to operate as a CCP and is permitted by the appropriate regulator or oversight body to operate as such with respect to the products offered by that CCP.\n\n## Qualifying revolving retail\n\nThis exposure class includes credit cards, unsecured lines of credit and overdraft protection products extended to individuals. Under the standardized approach, these exposures would be included under 'other retail'.\n\n## Real estate secured personal lending\n\nThis exposure class includes residential mortgages and home equity loans and lines of credit extended to individuals.\n\n## Regulatory capital\n\nRegulatory capital, as defined by OSFI's CAR Guideline, is comprised of CET1, Additional Tier 1 (AT1) and Tier 2 capital. CET1 capital includes common shares, retained earnings, AOCI (excluding AOCI relating to cash flow hedges and changes in fair value option liabilities attributable to changes in own credit risk) and qualifying instruments issued by a consolidated banking subsidiary to third parties, less regulatory adjustments for items such as goodwill and other intangible assets, certain deferred tax assets, net assets related to defined benefit pension plans, and certain investments. AT1 capital primarily includes NVCC preferred shares, Limited Recourse Capital Notes, and qualifying instruments issued by a consolidated subsidiary to third parties. Tier 1 capital is comprised of CET1 plus AT1. Tier 2 capital includes NVCC subordinated indebtedness, eligible general allowances, and qualifying instruments issued by a consolidated subsidiary to third parties. Total capital is comprised of Tier 1 capital plus Tier 2 capital. Qualifying regulatory capital instruments must be capable of absorbing loss at the point of non-viability of the financial institution.\n\n## Repo-style transactions exposure\n\nThe amount of credit risk exposure resulting from our securities bought or sold under resale agreements, as well as securities borrowing and lending activities.\n\n## Reputation risk\n\nThe risk of negative publicity regarding CIBC's business conduct or practices which, whether true or not, could significantly harm CIBC's reputation as a leading financial institution, or could materially and adversely affect CIBC's business, operations, or financial condition.\n\n## Resecuritization\n\nA securitization exposure in which the risk associated with an underlying pool of exposures is tranched and at least one of the underlying exposures is a securitization exposure.\n\n## Retail portfolios\n\nA category of exposures that primarily includes consumer but also small business lending, where the primary basis of adjudication relies on creditscoring models.\n\n## Risk-weighted assets (RWA)\n\nRWA consist of three components: (i) RWA for credit risk, which are calculated using the IRB and standardized approaches, (ii) RWA for market risk, and (iii) RWA for operational risk. The IRB RWA are calculated using PDs, LGDs, EADs, and in some cases maturity adjustments, while the standardized approach applies risk weighting factors specified in the OSFI guidelines to on- and off-balance sheet exposures. The RWA for market risk in the trading portfolio are based on the internal models approved by OSFI with the exception of the RWA for traded securitization assets where we are using the methodology defined by OSFI. The RWA for operational risk, which relate to the risk of losses resulting from people, inadequate or failed internal processes, and systems or from external events, are calculated under a standardized approach.\n\nSince the introduction of Basel II in 2008, OSFI has prescribed a capital floor requirement for institutions that use the AIRB approach for credit risk. The capital floor is determined by comparing a capital requirement calculated by reference to the Basel II standardized approach against the Basel III calculation, as specified by OSFI. Any shortfall in the Basel III capital requirement is added to RWA.\n\n## Securitization\n\nThe process of selling assets (normally financial assets such as loans, leases, trade receivables, credit card receivables or mortgages) to trusts or other SEs. A SE normally issues securities or other forms of interests to investors and/or the asset transferor, and the SE uses the proceeds from the issue of securities or other forms of interest to purchase the transferred assets. The SE will generally use the cash flows generated by the assets to meet the obligations under the securities or other interests issued by the SE, which may carry a number of different risk profiles.\n\n## Simple, transparent and comparable (STC) securitizations\n\nSecuritization exposures satisfying a set of regulatory STC criteria. Such exposures qualify for a preferential capital treatment under the securitization framework.",

        "page_content": "## Small and medium enterprises (SME) retail\n\nThis exposure class includes all loans extended to scored small businesses under the regulatory capital reporting framework.\n\n## Sovereign exposures\n\nAll direct credit risk exposures to governments, central banks and certain public sector entities, and exposures guaranteed by those entities.\n\n## Specialized lending (SL)\n\nA subset of Corporate exposures falling into one of the following sub-classes: project finance (PF), object finance (OF), commodities finance (CF), income-producing real estate (IPRE), and high-volatility commercial real estate (HVCRE). Primary source of repayment for such credits is the income generated by the asset(s), rather than the independent capacity of a broader commercial enterprise.\n\n## Standardized approach for credit risk\n\nApplied to exposures when there is not sufficient information to allow for the use of the AIRB approach for credit risk. Credit risk capital requirements are calculated based on a standardized set of risk weights as prescribed in the CAR Guideline. The standardized risk weights are based on external credit assessments, where available, and other risk-related factors, including export credit agencies, exposure asset class, collateral, etc.\n\n## Standardized approach for operational risk\n\nEffective in the second quarter of 2023, this approach is based on a prescribed formula made up of three components: (i) the Business Indicator (BI) which is a financial-statement-based proxy for operational risk, (ii) the Business Indicator Component (BIC) which is calculated by multiplying the BI by a set of regulatory determined marginal coefficients, and (iii) the Internal Loss Multiplier which is a scaling factor that is based on the average historical operational losses and the BIC.\n\n## Standardized approach for securitization exposures\n\nThis approach comprises the calculation methods available for securitization exposures that do not require OSFI approval: the external ratings-based approach (SEC-ERBA) and the standardized approach (SEC-SA).\n\n## Strategic risk\n\nThe risk of ineffective or improper implementation of business strategies, including mergers and acquisitions. It includes the potential financial loss and impact to resiliency due to the failure of organic growth initiatives or failure to respond appropriately to changes in the business or industry environments.\n\n## Stressed Value-at-Risk (VaR)\n\nA VaR calculation using a one-year observation period related to significant losses for the given portfolio at a specified level of confidence and time horizon.\n\n## Structural foreign exchange risk\n\nStructural foreign exchange risk is the risk primarily inherent in net investments in foreign operations due to changes in foreign exchange rates, and foreign currency denominated RWA and foreign currency denominated capital deductions.\n\n## Structural interest rate risk\n\nStructural interest rate risk primarily consists of the risk arising due to mismatches in assets and liabilities, which do not arise from trading and trading-related businesses.\n\n## Total loss absorbing capacity (TLAC) measure\n\nThe sum of Total capital and bail-in eligible liabilities (as defined above) that have a residual maturity greater than one year.\n\n## Total loss absorbing capacity ratio\n\nDefined as TLAC measure divided by RWA determined in accordance with guidelines issued by OSFI.\n\n## Total loss absorbing capacity leverage ratio\n\nDefined as TLAC measure divided by leverage ratio exposure determined in accordance with guidelines issued by OSFI.\n\n## Transitional arrangements for capital treatment of expected loss provisioning\n\nOn March 27, 2020, OSFI introduced transitional arrangements for ECL provisioning. These arrangements result in a portion of allowances that would otherwise be included in Tier 2 capital qualifying for inclusion in CET1 capital. The amount of ECL allowances eligible for inclusion in CET1 capital is determined based on the increase in stage 1 and stage 2 allowances relative to balances as at January 31, 2020 as a baseline. This amount is then adjusted for tax effects and is subject to a scaling factor that will decrease over time. The scaling factor has been set at 70% for fiscal 2020, 50% for fiscal 2021, and 25% for fiscal 2022. For exposures under the IRB approach, the lower of this amount and excess allowances eligible for inclusion in Tier 2 capital is included as CET1 capital under the transitional arrangements. The transitional arrangement was no longer applicable beginning in the first quarter of 2023.\n\n## Undrawn exposures\n\nThe amount of credit risk exposure resulting from loans that have not been advanced to a customer, but which a customer may be entitled to draw in the future.\n\n## Value-at-Risk (VaR)\n\nGenerally accepted risk measure that uses statistical models to estimate the distribution of possible returns on a given portfolio at a specified level of confidence and time horizon.",

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Section 308(4) of the Bank Act (Canada), which requires that the financial statements be prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). The MD&A has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of applicable securities laws.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements and MD&A contain items that reflect the best estimates and judgments of the expected effects of current events and transactions with appropriate consideration to materiality. Financial information appearing throughout the Annual Report is consistent with the consolidated financial statements.\n\nManagement has developed and maintained effective systems, controls and procedures to ensure that information used internally and disclosed externally is reliable and timely. CIBC's system of internal controls and supporting procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that transactions are authorized, assets are safeguarded and proper records are maintained. These internal controls and supporting procedures include the communication of policies and guidelines, the establishment of an organizational structure that provides appropriate and well-defined responsibilities and accountability, and the careful selection and training of qualified staff. Management has assessed the effectiveness of CIBC's internal control over financial reporting as at year-end using the Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework). Based upon this assessment, we have determined that internal control over financial reporting is effective in all material respects and CIBC is in compliance with the requirements set by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) under the U.S. Sarbanes-Oxley Act.\n\nCIBC's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have certified CIBC's annual filings with the SEC under the U.S. Sarbanes-Oxley Act and with the Canadian Securities Administrators under Canadian securities laws.\n\nThe Internal Audit department reviews and reports on the effectiveness of CIBC's internal control, risk management and governance systems and processes, including accounting and financial controls, in accordance with the audit plan approved by the Audit Committee. Our Chief Auditor has unfettered access to the Audit Committee. The system of internal controls is further supported by the Compliance and Global Regulatory Affairs group, which is designed to manage and mitigate regulatory compliance risk.\n\nThe Board of Directors oversees management's responsibilities for financial reporting through the Audit Committee, which is composed of independent directors. The Audit Committee reviews CIBC's interim and annual consolidated financial statements and MD&A and recommends them for approval by the Board of Directors. Other key responsibilities of the Audit Committee include monitoring CIBC's system of internal control, and reviewing the qualifications, independence and service quality of the shareholders' auditor and the performance of CIBC's internal auditors.\n\nErnst & Young LLP, the shareholders' auditor, obtains an understanding of CIBC's internal controls and procedures for financial reporting to plan and conduct such tests and other audit procedures as they consider necessary in the circumstances to express their opinions in the reports that follow. Ernst & Young LLP has unrestricted access to the Audit Committee to discuss their audit and related matters.\n\nThe Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (OSFI) Canada is mandated to protect the rights and interest of depositors and creditors of CIBC. Accordingly, OSFI examines and enquires into the business and affairs of CIBC, as deemed necessary, to ensure that the provisions of the Bank Act (Canada) are being complied with and that CIBC is in sound financial condition.\n\nVictor G.

        "page_content": "## Independent auditor's report\n\n## To the shareholders and directors of Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce\n\n## Opinion\n\nWe have audited the consolidated financial statements of Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CIBC), which comprise the consolidated balance sheets as at October 31, 2023 and 2022, and the consolidated statements of income, consolidated statements of comprehensive income, consolidated statements of changes in equity and the consolidated statements of cash flows for the years then ended, and notes to the consolidated financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies (collectively referred to as the 'consolidated financial statements').\n\nIn our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of CIBC as at October 31, 2023 and 2022, and its consolidated financial performance and its consolidated cash flows for the years then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board.\n\n## Basis for opinion\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with Canadian generally accepted auditing standards. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated financial statements section of our report. We are independent of CIBC in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the consolidated financial statements in Canada, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\n## Key audit matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements of the year ended October 31, 2023. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. For each matter below, our description of how our audit addressed the matter is provided in that context.\n\nWe have fulfilled the responsibilities described in the Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated financial statements section of our report, including in relation to these matters. Accordingly, our audit included the performance of procedures designed to respond to our assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements. The results of our audit procedures, including the procedures performed to address the matters below, provide the basis for our audit opinion on the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Allowance for credit losses\n\nKey audit matter\n\nHow our audit addressed the key audit matter\n\nAs described in Note 1 and Note 5 of the consolidated financial statements, CIBC has recognized $4.1 billion in expected credit loss (ECL) allowances on its consolidated balance sheet. ECL allowances represent an unbiased and probabilityweighted amount, which is determined by evaluating a range of possible outcomes and reasonable and supportable information about past events, current conditions, and forecasts of future economic conditions. Forward-looking information (FLI), which involves significant judgment, is explicitly incorporated into the estimation of ECL allowances. ECL allowances are measured at amounts equal to either (i) 12-month ECL; or (ii) lifetime ECL for those financial instruments that have experienced a significant increase in credit risk (SICR) since initial recognition or when there is objective evidence of impairment.\n\nAuditing the allowance for credit losses was complex, involved significant auditor judgment, and required the involvement of specialists due to the inherent complexity of the models, the large volume of data used, assumptions, judgments, and the interrelationship of these variables in measuring the ECL. Significant assumptions and judgments with respect to the estimation of the allowance for credit losses include (i) the determination of when a loan has experienced a SICR; (ii) the forecast of FLI for multiple economic scenarios and the probability weighting of those scenarios; (iii) the models and methodologies used for the calculation of both 12-month and lifetime credit losses; and (iv) the application of expert credit judgment. Management has applied a heightened use of judgment in the areas noted above, when assessing the impact of the uncertain macroeconomic environment on the allowance for credit losses.\n\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of management's controls over the allowance for credit losses, with the assistance of our internal specialists. The controls we tested included, amongst others, controls over technology, model development, validation and monitoring, economic forecasting, data completeness and accuracy, the determination of internal risk ratings for non-retail loans, and the governance and oversight controls over the review of the overall ECL, including the application of expert credit judgment.\n\nTo test the allowance for credit losses, amongst other procedures, we assessed, with the assistance of our credit risk specialists, whether the methodology and assumptions used in significant models that estimate ECL are consistent with the requirements of IFRS 9. For a sample of models, our credit risk specialists reperformed the model validation and monitoring tests performed by management. This included an assessment of the thresholds used to determine a SICR. For a sample of FLI variables, with the assistance of our economic specialists, we evaluated management's forecasting methodology and compared management's FLI to independently derived forecasts and publicly available information. We also evaluated the scenario probability weights used in the ECL models. With the assistance of our credit risk specialists, we also evaluated management's methodology and governance over the application of expert credit judgment by evaluating that the amounts recorded were reflective of underlying credit and/or economic conditions. We tested the completeness and accuracy of data used in the measurement of the ECL by agreeing to source documents and systems and evaluated a sample of non-retail borrower risk ratings against CIBC's risk rating scale. On a sample basis, we recalculated the ECL to test the mathematical accuracy of management's models. We also assessed the adequacy of the disclosures related to allowance for credit loss.",

The portfolio of derivative instruments is presented by level within the fair value hierarchy, with the majority of the portfolio classified as Level 2. While derivative instruments classified as Level 1 have quoted market prices, those classified as Level 2 and 3 require valuation techniques that use observable and non-observable market inputs and involve the application of management judgment.\n\nAuditing the valuation of certain derivatives was complex and required the application of significant auditor judgment and involvement of valuation specialists where the fair value was determined based on complex models and/or significant non-observable market inputs, including any significant valuation adjustments. The inputs and modelling assumptions used to determine fair values that were subject to significant auditor judgment included, amongst others, correlations, volatilities and credit spreads. The valuation of derivatives is sensitive to these inputs as they are forward-looking and could be affected by future economic and market conditions.\n\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of management's controls over the valuation of CIBC's derivatives portfolio, with the assistance of our internal specialists. The controls we tested included, amongst others, controls over technology, the development and validation of models used to determine the fair value of derivatives, controls over the independent price verification process, including the integrity of significant inputs described above, and controls over significant valuation adjustments applied.\n\nTo test the valuation of these derivatives, our audit procedures included, amongst others, an evaluation of the methodologies and significant inputs used by CIBC. With the assistance of our valuation specialists, we performed an independent valuation for a sample of derivatives and valuation adjustments to assess the modelling assumptions and significant inputs used by CIBC to estimate the fair value. We independently obtained significant inputs and assumptions from external market data, where available, in performing our independent valuation. For a sample of models, and with the assistance of our valuation specialists, we assessed the valuation methodologies used by CIBC to determine fair values. We also assessed the adequacy of the disclosures related to the fair value measurement of derivatives.\n\n## Measurement of uncertain tax provisions\n\nAs described in Note 1 and Note 19 of the consolidated financial statements, CIBC has disclosed its significant accounting judgments, estimates and assumptions in relation to accounting for uncertainty in income taxes. CIBC operates in a tax environment with constantly evolving and complex tax legislation for financial institutions. Uncertainty in tax positions may arise as tax legislation is subject to interpretation. Estimating uncertain tax provisions requires management judgment to be applied in the interpretation of tax laws across the various jurisdictions in which CIBC operates. This includes significant judgment in the determination of whether it is probable that CIBC's tax filing positions will be sustained relating to certain complex tax positions and the measurement of such provisions when recognized.\n\nAuditing CIBC's uncertain tax provisions required the involvement of our tax professionals and the application of judgment, including the interpretation of applicable tax legislation and jurisprudence.\n\nWith the assistance of our tax professionals, we obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of management's controls over CIBC's uncertain tax provisions. This included, amongst others, controls over management's assessment of the technical merits of tax positions and the process related to the measurement of any related income tax provisions.\n\nWith the assistance of our tax professionals, our audit procedures included, amongst others, an assessment of the technical merits of income tax positions taken by CIBC and the measurement of any related uncertain tax provisions recorded. We inspected and evaluated correspondence from the relevant income tax authorities, income tax advice obtained by CIBC from external advisors including income tax opinions, CIBC's interpretations of tax laws and the assessment thereof with respect to uncertain tax positions. We evaluated the reasonability of CIBC's treatment of any new information received during the year relating to these uncertain tax positions. We also assessed the adequacy of the disclosures related to uncertain tax positions.\n\n## Other information\n\nManagement is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises:\n\n- \u0081 Management's Discussion and Analysis; and\n- \u0081 The information, other than the consolidated financial statements and our auditor's report thereon, in the Annual Report.\n\nOur opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nIn connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.\n\nWe obtained Management's Discussion and Analysis and the Annual Report prior to the date of this auditor's report. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact in this auditor's report. We have nothing to report in this regard.",

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with Canadian generally accepted auditing standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with Canadian generally accepted auditing standards, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n\n- \u0081 Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- \u0081 Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of CIBC's internal control.\n- \u0081 Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.\n- \u0081 Conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on CIBC's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause CIBC to cease to continue as a going concern.\n- \u0081 Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n- \u0081 Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within CIBC to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.\n\nWe communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.\n\nWe also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\n\nThe engagement partner on the audit resulting in this independent auditor's report is Humayun Jafrani.\n\n## /s/ Ernst & Young LLP\n\nChartered Professional Accountants Licensed Public Accountants Toronto, Canada November 29, 2023",

Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements.

A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\n## /s/ Ernst & Young LLP\n\nChartered Professional Accountants Licensed Public Accountants Toronto, Canada November 29, 2023",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the consolidated financial statements\n\nCanadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CIBC) is a diversified financial institution governed by the Bank Act (Canada). CIBC was formed through the amalgamation of the Canadian Bank of Commerce and Imperial Bank of Canada in 1961. Through our four strategic business units (SBUs) Canadian Personal and Business Banking, Canadian Commercial Banking and Wealth Management, U.S. Commercial Banking and Wealth Management, and Capital Markets and Direct Financial Services - CIBC provides a full range of financial products and services to 14 million personal banking, business, public sector and institutional clients in Canada, the United States (U.S.) and around the world. Refer to Note 30 for further details on our business units. CIBC is incorporated and domiciled in Canada, with our registered and principal business offices located at CIBC SQUARE, Toronto, Ontario.\n\n## Note 1 Basis of preparation and summary of significant accounting policies\n\n## Basis of preparation\n\nThe consolidated financial statements of CIBC have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). These consolidated financial statements also comply with Section 308(4) of the Bank Act (Canada) and the requirements of the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (OSFI).\n\nCIBC has consistently applied the same accounting policies throughout all periods presented.\n\nThese consolidated financial statements are presented in millions of Canadian dollars, unless otherwise indicated.\n\nThese consolidated financial statements were authorized for issue by the Board of Directors (the Board) on November 29, 2023.\n\n## Summary of significant accounting policies\n\nThe following paragraphs describe our significant accounting policies.\n\n## Use of estimates and assumptions\n\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the recognized and measured amounts of assets, liabilities, net income, comprehensive income and related disclosures. Significant estimates and assumptions are made in the areas of the valuation of financial instruments, allowance for credit losses, the evaluation of whether to consolidate structured entities (SEs), leases, asset impairment, income taxes, provisions and contingent liabilities, post-employment and other long-term benefit plan assumptions and the valuation of self-managed loyalty points programs. Actual results could differ from these estimates and assumptions.\n\n## Basis of consolidation\n\nWe consolidate entities over which we have control. We have control over another entity when we have: (i) power to direct relevant activities of the entity; (ii) exposure, or rights, to variable returns from our involvement with the entity; and (iii) the ability to affect those returns through our power over the entity.\n\n## Subsidiaries\n\nSubsidiaries are entities over which CIBC has control. Generally, CIBC has control of its subsidiaries through a shareholding of more than 50% of the voting rights, and has significant exposure to the subsidiaries based on its ownership interests of more than 50%. The effects of potential voting rights that CIBC has the practical ability to exercise are considered when assessing whether control exists. Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date control is obtained by CIBC and are deconsolidated from the date control is lost. Consistent accounting policies are applied for all consolidated subsidiaries. Details of our significant subsidiaries are provided in Note 26.\n\n## Structured entities\n\nA SE is an entity that has been designed so that voting or similar rights are not the dominant factor in deciding who controls the entity, such as when any voting rights relate to administrative tasks only and the significant relevant activities are directed by contractual arrangements. SEs often have some or all of the following features or attributes: (i) restricted activities; (ii) a narrow and well-defined objective, such as to securitize our own financial assets or third-party financial assets to provide sources of funding or to provide investment opportunities for investors by passing on risks and rewards associated with the assets of the SE to investors; (iii) insufficient equity to permit the SE to finance its activities without subordinated financial support; or (iv) financing in the form of multiple contractually linked instruments to investors that create concentrations of credit or other risks. Examples of SEs include securitization vehicles, asset-backed financings, and investment funds.\n\nWhen voting rights are not relevant in deciding whether CIBC has power over an entity, particularly for complex SEs, the assessment of control considers all facts and circumstances, including the purpose and design of the investee, its relationship with other parties and each party's ability to make decisions over significant activities, and whether CIBC is acting as a principal or as an agent.\n\nWe do not have control over an investee when we are acting as the agent for a third-party. In assessing whether we are an agent we determine (i) the scope of our decision-making authority, (ii) the rights held by other parties, (iii) the remuneration to which we are entitled and (iv) our exposure to variability of returns from other interests that we hold in the investee.\n\nConsolidation conclusions are reassessed whenever there is a change in the specific facts and circumstances relevant to one or more of the three elements of control. Factors that trigger the reassessment include, but are not limited to, significant changes in ownership structure of the entities, changes in contractual or governance arrangements, provision of a liquidity facility beyond the original terms, transactions with the entities that were not contemplated originally and changes in the financing structure of the entities.\n\n## Transactions eliminated on consolidation\n\nAll intercompany transactions, balances and unrealized gains and losses on transactions are eliminated on consolidation.\n\n## Non-controlling interests\n\nNon-controlling interests are presented on the consolidated balance sheet as a separate component of equity that is distinct from CIBC's shareholders' equity. The net income attributable to non-controlling interests is presented separately in the consolidated statement of income.",

        "page_content": "## Consolidated financial statements\n\n## Associates and joint ventures\n\nWe classify investments in entities over which we have significant influence, and that are neither subsidiaries nor joint ventures, as associates. Significant influence is presumed to exist where we hold, either directly or indirectly, between 20% and 50% of the voting rights of an entity, or, in the case of a limited partnership, where CIBC is a co-general partner. Significant influence also may exist where we hold less than 20% of the voting rights of an entity, for example if we have influence over policy-making processes through representation on the entity's Board of Directors, or by other means. Where we are a party to a contractual arrangement whereby we undertake an economic activity that is subject to joint control together with one or more parties, we classify our interest in the venture as a joint venture.\n\nInvestments in associates and interests in joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method. Under the equity method, such investments are initially measured at cost, including attributable goodwill and intangible assets, and are adjusted thereafter for the post-acquisition change in our share of the net assets of the investment.\n\nIn applying the equity method for an investment that has a different reporting period from that of CIBC, adjustments are made for the effects of any significant events or transactions that occur between the reporting date of the investment and CIBC's reporting date.\n\n## Foreign currency translation\n\nMonetary assets and liabilities and non-monetary assets and liabilities measured at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currencies of operations at prevailing exchange rates at the date of the consolidated balance sheet. Revenue and expenses are translated using average monthly exchange rates. Realized and unrealized gains and losses arising from translation into functional currencies are included in the consolidated statement of income, with the exception of unrealized foreign exchange gains and losses on FVOCI equity securities, which are included in AOCI.\n\nAssets and liabilities of foreign operations with a functional currency other than the Canadian dollar, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on acquisition, are translated into Canadian dollars at the exchange rates prevailing as at the consolidated balance sheet date, while revenue and expenses of these foreign operations are translated into Canadian dollars at the average monthly exchange rates. Exchange gains and losses arising from the translation of these foreign operations and from the results of hedging the net investment in these foreign operations, net of applicable taxes, are included in Net foreign currency translation adjustments, in AOCI.\n\nAny accumulated exchange gains and losses, including the impact of hedging, and any applicable taxes in AOCI are reclassified into the consolidated statement of income when there is a disposal of a foreign operation, including a partial disposal of a foreign operation that involves the loss of control. On partial disposal of a foreign operation that does not involve the loss of control, the proportionate share of the accumulated exchange gains and losses, including the impact of hedging, and any applicable taxes previously recognized in AOCI are reclassified into the consolidated statement of income.\n\n## Accounting for financial instruments\n\n## Classification and measurement of financial instruments\n\nAll financial assets must be classified at initial recognition as financial instruments mandatorily measured at FVTPL (trading and non-trading), financial instruments measured at amortized cost, debt financial instruments measured at FVOCI, equity financial instruments designated at FVOCI, or financial instruments designated at FVTPL (fair value option), based on the contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial assets and the business model under which the financial assets are managed. All financial assets and derivatives are required to be measured at fair value with the exception of financial assets measured at amortized cost. Financial assets are required to be reclassified when and only when the business model under which they are managed has changed. All reclassifications are to be applied prospectively from the reclassification date.\n\nThe classification and measurement model requires that all debt instrument financial assets that do not meet a 'solely payment of principal and interest' (SPPI) test, including those that contain embedded derivatives, be classified at initial recognition as FVTPL. The SPPI test is conducted to identify whether the contractual cash flows of a financial instrument are 'solely payments of principal and interest' such that any variability in the contractual cash flows is consistent with a 'basic lending arrangement'. 'Principal' for the purpose of this test is defined as the fair value of the financial asset at initial recognition and may change over the life of the financial asset, for example, due to repayments of principal or amortization of the premium/discount. 'Interest' for the purpose of this test is defined as the consideration for the time value of money and credit risk, which are the most significant elements of interest within a lending arrangement. Contractual terms that introduce a more than de minimis exposure to risks or volatility in the contractual cash flows that are unrelated to a basic lending arrangement do not give rise to contractual cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the amount outstanding. The intent of the SPPI test is to ensure that debt instruments that contain non-basic lending features, such as conversion options and equity-linked payouts, are measured at FVTPL.\n\nFor debt instrument financial assets that meet the SPPI test, classification at initial recognition is determined based on the business model under which these instruments are managed. Debt instruments that are managed on a 'held for trading' or 'fair value' basis are classified as FVTPL. Debt instruments that are managed on a 'hold to collect and for sale' basis are classified as FVOCI for debt. Debt instruments that are managed on a 'hold to collect' basis are classified as amortized cost. We consider the following in our determination of the applicable business model for financial assets:\n\n- I) The business purpose of the portfolio;\n- II) The risks that are being managed and the type of business activities that are being carried out on a day-to-day basis to manage the risks;\n- III) The basis on which performance of the portfolio is being evaluated; and\n- IV) The frequency and significance of sales activity.\n\nAll equity instrument financial assets are classified at initial recognition as FVTPL unless they are not held with the intent for short-term profit-taking and an irrevocable designation is made to classify the instrument as FVOCI for equities.\n\nFinancial liabilities, other than derivatives, obligations related to securities sold short and FVO liabilities, are measured at amortized cost. Derivatives, obligations related to securities sold short and FVO financial liabilities are measured at fair value.\n\nDerivatives are measured at FVTPL, except to the extent that they are designated in a hedging relationship, in which case the International Accounting Standard (IAS) 39 'Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement' (IAS 39) hedge accounting requirements continue to apply.\n\n## Financial instruments mandatorily measured at FVTPL (trading and non-trading)\n\nTrading financial instruments are mandatorily measured at FVTPL as they are held for trading purposes or are part of a managed portfolio with a pattern of short-term profit-taking. Non-trading financial assets are also mandatorily measured at fair value if their contractual cash flow characteristics do not meet the SPPI test or if they are managed together with other financial instruments on a fair value basis.",

        "page_content": "## Consolidated financial statements\n\nTrading and non-trading financial instruments mandatorily measured at FVTPL are remeasured at fair value as at the consolidated balance sheet date. Gains and losses realized on disposition and unrealized gains and losses from changes in fair value are included in Non-interest income as Gains (losses) from financial instruments measured/designated at FVTPL, net. Interest income and dividends earned on trading and non-trading securities and dividends and interest expense incurred on securities sold short are included in Interest income and Interest expense, respectively.\n\n## Financial instruments designated at FVTPL (fair value option)\n\nFinancial instruments designated at FVTPL are those that we voluntarily designate at initial recognition as instruments that we will measure at fair value through the consolidated statement of income that would otherwise fall into a different accounting category. The FVO designation, once made, is irrevocable and can only be applied if reliable fair values are available, when doing so eliminates or significantly reduces the measurement inconsistency that would otherwise arise from measuring assets or liabilities on a different basis and if certain OSFI requirements pertaining to certain loans are met. Financial liabilities may also be designated at FVTPL when they are part of a portfolio which is managed on a fair value basis, in accordance with our investment strategy, and are reported internally on that basis. Designation at FVTPL may also be applied to financial liabilities that have one or more embedded derivatives that would otherwise require bifurcation. We apply the FVO to certain mortgage commitments.\n\nGains and losses realized on dispositions and unrealized gains and losses from changes in the fair value of FVO financial instruments are treated in the same manner as financial instruments which are mandatorily measured at FVTPL, except that changes in the fair value of FVO liabilities that are attributable to changes in own credit risk are recognized in OCI. Dividends and interest earned, and interest expense incurred on FVO assets and liabilities are included in Interest income and Interest expense, respectively.\n\n## Financial assets measured at amortized cost\n\nFinancial assets measured at amortized cost are debt financial instruments with contractual cash flows that meet the SPPI test and are managed on a 'hold to collect' basis. These financial assets are recognized initially at fair value plus or minus direct and incremental transaction costs, and are subsequently measured at amortized cost, using the effective interest rate method, net of an allowance for expected credit losses (ECL).\n\nLoans measured at amortized cost include residential mortgages, personal loans, credit cards and most business and government loans. Certain portfolios of treasury securities that are managed on a 'hold to collect' basis are also classified as amortized cost. Most deposits with banks, securities purchased under resale agreements, cash collateral on securities borrowed and most customers' liability under acceptances are accounted for at amortized cost.\n\n## Debt financial assets measured at FVOCI\n\nDebt financial instruments measured at FVOCI are non-derivative financial assets with contractual cash flows that meet the SPPI test and are managed on a 'hold to collect and for sale' basis.\n\nFVOCI debt instruments are measured initially at fair value, plus direct and incremental transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, FVOCI debt instruments are remeasured at fair value, with the exception that changes in ECL allowances in addition to related foreign exchange gains or losses are recognized in the consolidated statement of income. Cumulative gains and losses previously recognized in OCI are transferred from AOCI to the consolidated statement of income when the debt instrument is sold. Realized gains and losses on sale, determined on an average cost basis, and changes in ECL allowances, are included in Gains (losses) from debt securities measured at FVOCI and amortized cost, net in the consolidated statement of income. Interest income from FVOCI debt instruments is included in Interest income. FVOCI debt instruments include our treasury securities which are managed on a 'hold to collect and for sale' basis.\n\nA debt financial instrument is classified as impaired (stage 3) when one or more events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of that financial instrument have occurred after its initial recognition. Evidence of impairment includes indications that the borrower is experiencing significant financial difficulty, or a default or delinquency has occurred.\n\n## Equity financial instruments designated at FVOCI\n\nEquity financial instruments are measured at FVTPL unless an irrevocable designation is made to measure them at FVOCI. Gains or losses from changes in the fair value of equity instruments designated at FVOCI, including any related foreign exchange gains or losses, are recognized in OCI. Amounts recognized in OCI will not be subsequently recycled to profit or loss, with the exception of dividends that are not considered a return of capital, which are recognized as interest income when received in the consolidated statement of income. Instead, cumulative gains or losses upon derecognition of the equity instrument will be transferred within equity from AOCI to retained earnings and presented in Realized gains (losses) on equity securities designated at FVOCI reclassified to retained earnings in the consolidated statement of changes in equity. Financial assets designated as FVOCI include non-trading equity securities, primarily related to our investment in private companies and certain limited partnerships.\n\n## Impairment of financial assets\n\nECL allowances are recognized on all financial assets that are debt instruments classified either as amortized cost or FVOCI and for all loan commitments and financial guarantees that are not measured at FVTPL. ECL allowances represent credit losses that reflect an unbiased and probability-weighted amount which is determined by evaluating a range of possible outcomes, the time value of money and reasonable and supportable information about past events, current conditions and forecasts of future economic conditions. Forward-looking information is explicitly incorporated into the estimation of ECL allowances, which involves significant judgment (see Note 5 for additional details).\n\nECL allowances for loans and acceptances are included in Allowance for credit losses on the consolidated balance sheet. ECL allowances for FVOCI debt securities are included as a component of the carrying value of the securities, which are measured at fair value. ECL allowances for other financial assets are included in the carrying value of the instrument. ECL allowances for guarantees and loan commitments are included in Other liabilities.\n\nECL allowances are measured at amounts equal to either: (i) 12-month ECL; or (ii) lifetime ECL for those financial instruments which have experienced a significant increase in credit risk (SICR) since initial recognition or when there is objective evidence of impairment.\n\nThe calculation of ECL allowances is based on the expected value of three probability-weighted scenarios to measure the expected cash shortfalls, discounted at the effective interest rate. A cash shortfall is the difference between the contractual cash flows that are due and the cash flows that we expect to receive. The key inputs in the measurement of ECL allowances are as follows:\n\n- \u0081 The probability of default (PD) is an estimate of the likelihood of default over a given time horizon;\n- \u0081 The loss given default (LGD) is an estimate of the loss arising in the case where a default occurs at a given time; and\n- \u0081 The exposure at default (EAD) is an estimate of the exposure at a future default date.",

        "page_content": "## Consolidated financial statements\n\nLifetime ECL is the expected credit losses that result from all possible default events over the expected life of a financial instrument. 12-month ECL is the portion of lifetime expected credit losses that represent the expected credit losses that result from default events on the financial instrument that are possible within the 12 months after the reporting date.\n\n## Stage migration and significant increase in credit risk\n\nAs a result of the requirements above, financial instruments subject to ECL allowances are categorized into three stages.\n\nFor performing financial instruments:\n\nStage 1 is comprised of all performing financial instruments which have not experienced a SICR since initial recognition. We recognize 12 months of ECL for stage 1 financial instruments. In assessing whether credit risk has increased significantly, we compare the risk of a default occurring on the financial instrument as at the reporting date with the risk of a default occurring on the financial instrument as at the date of its initial recognition.\n\nStage 2 is comprised of all performing financial instruments which have experienced a SICR since initial recognition. We recognize lifetime ECL for stage 2 financial instruments. In subsequent reporting periods, if the credit risk of the financial instrument improves such that there is no longer a SICR since initial recognition, then we revert to recognizing 12 months of ECL as the financial instrument has migrated back to stage 1.\n\nWe determine whether a financial instrument has experienced a SICR since its initial recognition on an individual financial instrument basis. Changes in the required ECL allowance, including the impact of financial instruments migrating between stage 1 and stage 2, are recorded in Provision for credit losses in the consolidated statement of income. Significant judgment is required in the application of SICR (see Note 5 for additional details).\n\nStage 3 financial instruments are those that we have classified as impaired. We recognize lifetime ECL for all stage 3 financial instruments. We classify a financial instrument as impaired when one or more events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of that financial instrument have occurred after its initial recognition. Evidence of impairment includes indications that the borrower is experiencing significant financial difficulties, or a default or delinquency has occurred. All financial instruments on which repayment of principal or payment of interest is contractually 90 days in arrears are automatically considered impaired, except for credit card loans, which are classified as impaired and are fully written off when payments are contractually 180 days in arrears or at the earlier of the notice of bankruptcy, settlement proposal, or enlistment of credit counselling services.\n\nA financial instrument is no longer considered impaired when all past due amounts, including interest, have been recovered, and it is determined that the principal and interest are fully collectable in accordance with the original contractual terms or revised market terms of the financial instrument with all criteria for the impaired classification having been remedied.\n\nFinancial instruments are written off, either partially or in full, against the related allowance for credit losses when we judge that there is no realistic prospect of future recovery in respect of those amounts. When financial instruments are secured, this is generally after all collateral has been realized or transferred to CIBC, or in certain circumstances, when the net realizable value of any collateral and other available information suggests that there is no reasonable expectation of further recovery. In subsequent periods, any recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited to the provision for credit losses.\n\n## Purchased loans\n\nBoth purchased performing and purchased credit-impaired loans are initially measured at their acquisition date fair values. As a result of recording these loans at fair value, no allowance for credit losses is recognized in the purchase equation at the acquisition date. Fair value is determined by estimating the principal and interest cash flows expected to be collected and discounting those cash flows at a market rate of interest. At the acquisition date, we classify a loan as performing where we expect timely collection of all amounts in accordance with the original contractual terms of the loan and as credit-impaired where it is probable that we will not be able to collect all contractually required payments.\n\nFor purchased performing loans, the acquisition date fair value adjustment on each loan is amortized to interest income over the expected remaining life of the loan using the effective interest rate method. The remaining unamortized amounts relating to those loans are recorded in income in the period that the loan is repaid. ECL allowances are established in Provision for credit losses in the consolidated statement of income immediately after the acquisition date based on classifying each loan in stage 1, since the acquisition date is established as the initial recognition date of purchased performing loans for the purpose of assessing whether a SICR has occurred. Subsequent to the acquisition date, ECL allowances are estimated in a manner consistent with our SICR and impairment policies that we apply to loans that we originate.\n\nFor purchased credit-impaired loans, the acquisition date fair value adjustment on each loan consists of management's estimate of the shortfall of principal and interest cash flows expected to be collected and the time value of money. The time value of money component of the fair value adjustment is amortized to interest income over the expected remaining life of the loan using the effective interest rate method. Subsequent to the acquisition date, we regularly re-estimate the expected cash flows for purchased credit-impaired loans. Decreases in the expected cash flows will result in an increase in our ECL allowance. Increases in the expected cash flows will result in a recovery of the ECL allowance. ECL allowances for purchased credit-impaired loans are reported in stage 3.\n\n## Originated credit-impaired financial assets\n\nThe accounting for originated credit-impaired financial assets operates in a similar manner to the accounting for purchased credit-impaired loans in that originated credit-impaired assets are initially recognized at fair value with no initial ECL allowance as concerns about the collection of future cash flows are instead reflected in the origination date discount. The time value of money component of the discount is amortized to interest income over the expected remaining life of the financial asset using the effective interest rate method. Changes in expectation regarding the contractual cash flows for loans are recognized immediately in Provision for credit losses and for securities are recognized in Gains (losses) from debt securities measured at FVOCI and amortized cost, net.\n\nThis accounting generally applies to financial assets that result from debt restructuring arrangements in which a previously impaired financial asset is exchanged for a new financial asset that is either recognized at a fair value that represents a deep discount to par or for which there are significant concerns over the ability to collect the contractual cash flows.\n\n## Determination of fair value\n\nFair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability between market participants in an orderly transaction in the principal market at the measurement date under current market conditions (i.e., the exit price). Fair value measurements are categorized into three levels within a fair value hierarchy (Level 1, 2 or 3) based upon the market observability of the valuation inputs used in measuring the fair value. See Note 2 for more details about fair value measurement subsequent to initial recognition by type of financial instrument.",

        "page_content": "## Consolidated financial statements\n\n## Transaction costs\n\nTransaction costs relating to financial instruments mandatorily measured or designated at FVTPL are expensed as incurred. Transaction costs are amortized over the expected life of the instrument using the effective interest rate method for instruments measured at amortized cost and debt instruments measured at FVOCI. For equity instruments designated at FVOCI, transaction costs are included in the instrument's carrying value.\n\n## Date of recognition of securities\n\nWe account for all securities transactions on our consolidated balance sheet using settlement date accounting.\n\n## Effective interest rate\n\nInterest income and expense for all financial instruments measured at amortized cost and for debt securities measured at FVOCI are recognized in Interest income and Interest expense using the effective interest rate method. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts or payments through the expected life of the financial instrument to the net carrying value of the financial asset or liability upon initial recognition. When calculating the effective interest rate, we estimate future cash flows considering all contractual terms of the financial instrument, but not future credit losses.\n\nFees relating to loan origination, including commitment, restructuring and renegotiation fees, are considered an integral part of the yield earned on the loan and are accounted for using the effective interest rate method. Fees received for commitments that are not expected to result in a loan are included in Non-interest income over the commitment period. Loan syndication fees are included in Non-interest income on completion of the syndication arrangement, provided that the yield on the portion of the loan we retain is at least equal to the average yield earned by the other lenders involved in the financing; otherwise, an appropriate portion of the fee is deferred as unearned income and amortized to interest income using the effective interest rate method.\n\nInterest income is recognized on stage 1 and stage 2 financial assets measured at amortized cost by applying the effective interest rate to the gross carrying amount of the financial instrument. For stage 3 financial instruments, interest income is recognized using the rate of interest used to discount the estimated future cash flows for the purpose of measuring the impairment loss and applied to the net carrying value of the financial instrument.\n\n## Securitizations and derecognition of financial assets\n\nSecuritization of our own assets provides us with an additional source of liquidity. As we generally retain substantially all of the risks and rewards of the transferred assets, assets remain on the consolidated balance sheet and funding from these transactions is accounted for as Deposits secured borrowings.\n\nSecuritizations to non-consolidated SEs are accounted for as sales, with the related assets being derecognized, only where:\n\n- \u0081 Our contractual right to receive cash flows from the assets has expired;\n- \u0081 We transfer our contractual rights to receive the cash flows of the financial asset, and have: (i) transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership, or (ii) neither retained nor transferred substantially all the risks and rewards, but have not retained control; or\n- \u0081 The transfer meets the criteria of a qualifying pass-through arrangement.\n\n## Derecognition of financial liabilities\n\nA financial liability is derecognized when the obligation under the liability is discharged, cancelled or expires. If an existing financial liability is replaced by another liability from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of the existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as a derecognition of the original liability and a recognition of a new liability, and the difference in the respective carrying values is recognized in the consolidated statement of income. The repurchase of a debt instrument is considered an extinguishment of that debt instrument even if we intend to resell the instrument in the near term.\n\n## Financial guarantees\n\nFinancial guarantees are financial contracts that require the issuer to make specified payments to reimburse the holder for a loss it incurs because a specified debtor fails to make payment when due in accordance with the original or modified terms of a debt instrument.\n\nFinancial guarantee contracts issued by CIBC that are not classified as insurance contracts are initially recognized as a liability at fair value, adjusted for transaction costs that are directly attributable to the issuance of the guarantees, which is generally the premium received or receivable on the date the guarantee was given. Subsequently, financial guarantee liabilities are measured at the higher of the initial fair value, less cumulative amortization, and the applicable ECL allowances. A financial guarantee that qualifies as a derivative is remeasured at fair value as at each reporting date and reported as Derivative instruments in assets or liabilities, as appropriate.\n\n## Mortgage commitments\n\nMortgage interest rate commitments are extended to our retail clients in contemplation of borrowing to finance the purchase of homes under mortgages to be funded by CIBC in the future. These commitments are usually for periods of up to 120 days and generally entitle the borrower to receive funding at the lower of the interest rate at the time of the commitment and the rate applicable at the funding date. We use financial instruments, such as interest rate derivatives, to economically hedge our exposure to an increase in interest rates. Based on our estimate of the commitments expected to be exercised, a financial liability is recognized on our consolidated balance sheet for those commitments where we apply the FVO. We also carry the associated economic hedges at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet. Changes in the fair value of the FVO commitment liability and the associated economic hedges are included in Gains (losses) from financial instruments measured/designated at FVTPL, net. In addition, since the fair value of the commitments is priced into the mortgage, the difference between the mortgage amount and its fair value at funding is recognized in the consolidated statement of income to offset the carrying value of the mortgage commitment that is released upon its expiry.\n\n## Offsetting of financial assets and financial liabilities\n\nFinancial assets and financial liabilities are offset, and the amount presented net in the consolidated balance sheet, when we have a legally enforceable right to set off the recognized amounts and intend to settle on a net basis or to realize the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.\n\n## Acceptances and customers' liability under acceptances\n\nAcceptances constitute a liability of CIBC on negotiable instruments issued to third parties by our customers. We earn a fee for guaranteeing and then making the payment to the third parties. The amounts owed to us by our customers in respect of these guaranteed amounts are reflected in assets as",

        "page_content": "Customers' liability under acceptances. See the \"Interest rate benchmark reform\" section below for details on the impact of CDOR cessation on acceptances and customers' liability under acceptances.\n\n## Securities purchased under resale agreements and obligations related to securities sold under repurchase agreements\n\nSecurities purchased under resale agreements are treated as collateralized lending transactions as they represent the purchase of securities affected with a simultaneous agreement to sell them back at a future date at a fixed price, which is generally near term. Securities subject to these transactions include certain loans that are readily securitizable. The agreements include certain total return swap arrangements that are economically equivalent to resale agreements. These transactions are classified and measured at amortized cost, as they meet the SPPI criteria and are managed under a hold to collect business model, unless they were classified at FVTPL or designated under the FVO. For Securities purchased under resale agreements that are classified at amortized cost, an ECL is applied. Interest income is accrued using the effective interest rate method and is included in Interest income - Securities borrowed or purchased under resale agreements in the consolidated statement of income.\n\nSimilarly, securities sold under agreements to repurchase are treated as collateralized borrowing transactions at amortized cost with interest expense accrued using the effective interest rate method and are included in Interest expense - Securities lent or sold under repurchase agreements in the consolidated statement of income. Certain obligations related to securities sold under repurchase agreements are designated at FVTPL under the FVO.\n\n## Cash collateral on securities borrowed and securities lent\n\nThe right to receive back cash collateral paid and the obligation to return cash collateral received on borrowing and lending of securities, which is generally near term, is recognized as cash collateral on securities borrowed and securities lent, respectively. These transactions are classified and measured at amortized cost as they meet the SPPI criteria and are managed under a hold to collect business model. For Cash collateral on securities borrowed classified at amortized cost, an ECL is applied. Interest income on cash collateral paid and interest expense on cash collateral received together with the security borrowing fees and security lending income are included in Interest income - Securities borrowed or purchased under resale agreements and Interest expense - Securities lent or sold under repurchase agreements, respectively. For securities borrowing and lending transactions where securities are pledged or received as collateral, securities pledged by CIBC remain on the consolidated balance sheet and securities received by CIBC are not recognized on the consolidated balance sheet.\n\n## Derivatives\n\nWe use derivative instruments for both asset/liability management (ALM) and trading purposes. The derivatives used for ALM purposes allow us to manage financial risks, such as movements in interest and foreign exchange rates, while our derivative trading activities are primarily driven by client activities. We may also take proprietary trading positions within prescribed risk limits with the objective of earning income.\n\nAll derivative instruments are recognized initially, and are measured subsequently, at fair value and are reported as assets where they have a positive fair value and as liabilities where they have a negative fair value, in both cases as derivative instruments. Any realized and unrealized gains or losses on derivatives used for trading purposes are recognized immediately in Gains (losses) from financial instruments measured/designated at FVTPL, net. The accounting for derivatives used for ALM purposes depends on whether they qualify for hedge accounting as discussed below.\n\nFair values of exchange-traded derivatives are based on quoted market prices. Fair values of over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives, including OTC derivatives that are centrally cleared, are obtained using valuation techniques, including discounted cash flow models and option pricing models. See Note 12 for further information on the valuation of derivatives.\n\n## Derivatives used for ALM purposes that qualify for hedge accounting\n\nAs permitted at the time of transition to IFRS 9 'Financial Instruments' (IFRS 9), we previously elected to continue to apply the hedge accounting requirements of IAS 39.\n\nWe apply hedge accounting for derivatives held for ALM purposes that meet specified criteria. There are three types of hedges: fair value, cash flow and hedges of net investments in foreign operations (NIFOs). When hedge accounting is not applied, the change in the fair value of the derivative is recognized in the consolidated statement of income (see the 'Derivatives used for ALM purposes that are not designated for hedge accounting' section below).\n\nIn order for derivatives to qualify for hedge accounting, the hedge relationship must be designated and formally documented at its inception in accordance with IAS 39. The particular risk management objective and strategy, the specific asset, liability or cash flow being hedged, as well as how hedge effectiveness is assessed, are documented. Hedge effectiveness requires a high correlation of changes in fair values or cash flows between the hedged and hedging items.\n\nWe assess the effectiveness of derivatives in hedging relationships, both at inception and on an ongoing basis. Ineffectiveness results to the extent that the change in the fair value of the hedging derivative differs from the change in the fair value of the hedged risk in the hedged item, or the cumulative change in the fair value of the hedging derivative exceeds the cumulative change in the fair value of expected future cash flows of the hedged item. The amount of ineffectiveness of hedging instruments is recognized immediately in the consolidated statement of income.\n\n## Interest rate benchmark reform\n\nIn response to interest rate benchmark reform, the IASB issued 'Interest Rate Benchmark Reform: Amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39 and IFRS 7' (Phase 1 amendments) in September 2019, and 'Interest Rate Benchmark Reform: Phase 2 Amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39, IFRS 7, IFRS 4, and IFRS 16' (Phase 2 amendments) in August 2020. Only the amendments to the classification and measurement sections of IFRS 9, the hedge accounting sections of IAS 39 'Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement' (IAS 39), IFRS 7 'Financial Instruments: Disclosures', IFRS 4 'Insurance Contracts', and IFRS 16 'Leases' apply to us since we elected to continue to apply the hedge accounting requirements of IAS 39 upon the adoption of IFRS 9 'Financial Instruments' (IFRS 9). We adopted the Phase 1 and Phase 2 amendments effective November 1, 2019 and November 1, 2020, respectively.\n\nDuring the period prior to the replacement of Interbank Offered Rates (IBORs), the Phase 1 amendments allow us to continue hedge accounting by assuming that the interest rate benchmarks which are the basis for the hedged risk, the cash flows of the hedged item or the hedging instrument are not altered as a result of the reform. For the bank's cash flow hedges of forecast transactions that are directly impacted by IBOR reform, for the purpose of assessing whether a forecast transaction is highly probable or expected to occur, the amendments allow us to assume that the benchmark interest rate on which the hedged cash flows are based is not altered as a result of IBOR reform. Phase 1 amendments also provide temporary exceptions to allow hedge accounting to continue if a hedge relationship does not meet certain hedge effectiveness assessment criteria solely as a result of IBOR reform.\n\nThe Phase 2 amendments address issues once an existing rate is replaced with an alternative rate. The amendments provide temporary relief that allows for hedging relationships to continue upon the replacement of an existing interest rate benchmark with an alternative rate under certain qualifying conditions. The amendments also allow us to redefine the hedged risk to an alternative rate, and to amend the description of the hedged item and the",

The amendments also provide temporary relief that allows us to designate an alternative rate as a risk component to hedge provided that we reasonably expect that the alternative rate will become separately identifiable within 24 months of its first designation. See the 'Interest rate benchmark reform' section below for further detail.\n\n## Fair value hedges\n\nWe designate fair value hedges primarily as part of interest rate risk management strategies that use derivatives to hedge changes in the fair value of financial instruments with fixed interest rates. Changes in fair value attributed to the hedged interest rate risk are accounted for as basis adjustments to the hedged financial instruments and are included in Net interest income. Changes in fair value from the hedging derivatives are also included in Net interest income. Any differences between the two represent hedge ineffectiveness that is included in Net interest income.\n\nSimilarly, for hedges of foreign exchange risk, changes in the fair value from the hedging derivatives and non-derivatives are included in FXOTT. Changes in the fair value of the hedged item from the hedged foreign exchange risk are accounted for as basis adjustments and are also included in FXOTT. Any difference between the two represents hedge ineffectiveness.\n\nIf the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or where the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, the hedge relationship is terminated and the basis adjustment applied to the hedged item is amortized over the remaining term of the hedged item. If the hedged item is derecognized, the unamortized basis adjustment is recognized immediately in the consolidated statement of income.\n\n## Cash flow hedges\n\nWe designate cash flow hedges as part of interest rate risk management strategies that use derivatives to mitigate our risk from variable cash flows by effectively converting certain variable-rate financial instruments to fixed-rate financial instruments, and as part of foreign exchange rate risk management strategies to hedge forecasted foreign currency denominated cash flows. We also designate cash flow hedges to hedge changes in CIBC's share price in respect of certain cash-settled share-based payment awards.\n\nThe effective portion of the change in fair value of the derivative instrument is recognized in OCI until the variability in cash flows being hedged is recognized in the consolidated statement of income in future accounting periods, at which time an appropriate portion of the amount that was in AOCI is reclassified into the consolidated statement of income. The ineffective portion of the change in fair value of the hedging derivative is included in Net interest income, FXOTT, or Non-interest expenses immediately as it arises.\n\nIf the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or where the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, the hedge relationship is terminated. Upon termination of the hedge relationship, any remaining amount in AOCI remains therein until it is recognized in the consolidated statement of income when the variability in cash flows hedged or the hedged forecast transaction is ultimately recognized in the consolidated statement of income. When the forecasted transaction is no longer expected to occur, the related cumulative gain or loss in AOCI is recognized immediately in the consolidated statement of income.\n\n## Hedges of NIFOs with a functional currency other than the Canadian dollar\n\nWe may designate NIFO hedges to mitigate the foreign exchange risk on our NIFOs with a functional currency other than the Canadian dollar. These hedges are accounted for in a similar manner to cash flow hedges. The change in fair value of the hedging instrument relating to the effective portion is recognized in OCI. The change in fair value of the hedging instrument attributable to the forward points and relating to the ineffective portion is recognized immediately in FXOTT. Gains and losses in AOCI are reclassified to the consolidated statement of income upon the disposal or partial disposal of the investment in the foreign operation that involves the loss of control, as explained in the 'Foreign currency translation' policy above.\n\n## Derivatives used for ALM purposes that are not designated for hedge accounting\n\nThe change in fair value of the derivatives not designated as accounting hedges but used to economically hedge FVO assets or liabilities is included in Gains (losses) from financial instruments measured/designated at FVTPL, net. The change in fair value of other derivatives not designated as accounting hedges but used for other economic hedging purposes is included in Non-interest income as FXOTT or Other, as appropriate, or in the case of economic hedges of cash-settled share-based payment obligations, in compensation expense.\n\n## Embedded derivatives\n\nDerivatives embedded in financial liabilities are accounted for as separate derivatives when their economic characteristics and risks are not closely related to those of the host instrument and the terms of the embedded derivative represent those of a freestanding derivative in situations where the combined instrument is not classified as FVTPL or FVO. These embedded derivatives, which are classified together with the host instrument on the consolidated balance sheet, are measured at fair value, with changes therein included in the consolidated statement of income. The residual amount of the host liability is accreted to its maturity value through Interest income and Interest expense, respectively, using the effective interest rate method.\n\nGains at inception on derivatives embedded in financial instruments bifurcated for accounting purposes are not recognized at inception; instead they are recognized over the life of the residual host instrument. Where an embedded derivative is separable from the host instrument but the fair value, as at the acquisition or reporting date, cannot be reliably measured separately or is otherwise not bifurcated, the entire combined contract is measured at FVTPL.\n\nFinancial assets with embedded derivatives are classified in their entirety into the appropriate classification at initial recognition through an assessment of the contractual cash flow characteristics of the asset and the business model under which it is managed.\n\n## Accumulated other comprehensive income\n\nAOCI is included on the consolidated balance sheet as a separate component of total equity, net of income tax. It includes net unrealized gains and losses on FVOCI debt and equity securities, the effective portion of gains and losses on derivative instruments designated within effective cash flow hedges under IAS 39, unrealized foreign currency translation gains and losses on foreign operations with a functional currency other than the Canadian dollar net of gains or losses on related hedges, net gains (losses) related to fair value changes of FVO liabilities attributable to changes in own credit risk, and net gains (losses) on post-employment defined benefit plans.\n\n## Treasury shares\n\nWhere we repurchase our own equity instruments, these instruments are treated as treasury shares and are deducted from equity at their cost with any gain or loss recognized in Contributed surplus or Retained earnings as appropriate. No gain or loss is recognized in the consolidated statement of income on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of our own equity instruments. Any difference between the carrying value and the consideration, if reissued, is also included in Contributed surplus.",

        "page_content": "## Liabilities and equity\n\nWe classify financial instruments as a liability or equity based on the substance of the contractual arrangement. An instrument is classified as a liability if it is a contractual obligation to deliver cash or another financial asset, or to exchange financial assets or financial liabilities at potentially unfavourable terms. A contract is also classified as a liability if it is a non-derivative and could obligate us to deliver a variable number of our own shares or it is a derivative other than one that can be settled by the delivery of a fixed amount of cash or another financial asset for a fixed number of our own equity instruments. An instrument is classified as equity if it evidences a residual interest in our assets after deducting all liabilities. The components of a compound financial instrument are classified and accounted for separately as assets, liabilities, or equity as appropriate. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issuance of equity instruments are shown in equity, net of income tax.\n\n## Property and equipment\n\nLand is recognized initially at cost and is subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Buildings, furniture, equipment and leasehold improvements are recognized initially at cost and are subsequently measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses.\n\nDepreciation commences when the assets are available for use and is recognized on a straight-line basis to depreciate the cost of these assets to their estimated residual value over their estimated useful lives. The estimated useful lives are as follows:\n\n- \u0081 Buildings - 40 years\n- \u0081 Computer equipment - 3 to 7 years\n- \u0081 Office furniture, equipment and other - 4 to 15 years\n- \u0081 Leasehold improvements - over the lesser of the estimated useful life of the asset and the lease term, including reasonably assured renewal periods\n\nDepreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each annual reporting date and are adjusted if appropriate.\n\nGains and losses on disposal are included in Non-interest income - Other.\n\n## Leases\n\nAs a lessee, we recognize a right-of-use asset and a corresponding lease liability based on the present value of future lease payments, less any lease incentives receivable, when the lessor makes the leased asset available for use to CIBC, based on the non-cancellable portion of the lease term, adjusted for any renewal or termination options that are reasonably certain to be exercised. Measurement of the right-of-use asset also includes any initial direct costs of procuring the lease, any lease payments made or lease incentives received prior to lease commencement, and the estimated cost of remediating the underlying asset at the end of the lease term. Discount rates are based on the rate implicit in the lease, if determinable, or on CIBC's incremental borrowing rate. Where a property lease contains both a lease and non-lease component, we have elected not to allocate the consideration in the contract to each of the components. Subsequent to initial measurement, CIBC measures the lease liability by increasing the carrying amount to reflect interest on the lease liability based on the discount rate at the time of recognition and reducing the carrying amount to reflect lease payments made during the period, net of any remeasurements for lease reassessment or modifications. The right-of-use asset is measured using the cost model, and amortized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Right-of-use assets and the corresponding lease liabilities, including asset retirement obligations, are recognized in Property and equipment and Other liabilities, respectively, on our consolidated balance sheet.\n\nThe right-of-use asset and the corresponding lease liability are remeasured when there is a change in lease term, a change in the assessment of an option to purchase a leased asset, a change in the expected residual value guarantee (if any), or a change in future lease payments due to a change in the index or rate applicable to the payment. Right-of-use assets are tested for impairment as required under IAS 36 'Impairment of Assets' (IAS 36). Refer to the 'Impairment of non-financial assets' policy below. In addition, the evaluation of the useful life for depreciation is assessed under IAS 16 'Property, Plant and Equipment' (IAS 16).\n\nLease payments for low-value assets, short-term leases and variable leases are systematically recognized in Non-interest expenses based on the nature of the expense.\n\nAs an intermediate lessor, we classify a sublease as an operating or finance sublease based on whether substantially all of the risks and rewards related to the underlying right-of-use asset are transferred to the sub-lessee. If classified as a finance sublease, the related right-of-use asset is derecognized and an investment in sublease is recognized, with the difference recognized in the consolidated statement of income as a gain or loss. In measuring the investment in sublease, we apply the head lease discount rate unless the rate implicit in the sublease is determinable. Where a finance sublease includes lease and non-lease components, we allocate the total consideration in the contract to each component based on the standalone prices for each of these components. The investment in sublease is recognized in Other assets on our consolidated balance sheet, and is subsequently measured using the effective interest rate method, with interest income recognized over the term of the sublease. Rental income from operating subleases is recognized on a systematic basis over the lease term.\n\n## Goodwill, software and other intangible assets\n\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired in business combinations. Identifiable intangible assets are recognized separately from goodwill when they are separable or arise from contractual or other legal rights, and have fair values that can be reliably measured.\n\nGoodwill is not amortized, but is subject to impairment review at least annually or more frequently if there are indicators that the goodwill may be impaired. Refer to the 'Impairment of non-financial assets' policy below.\n\nIntangible assets represent software and customer relationships, core deposit intangibles, investment management contracts, and brand names recognized as part of past acquisitions. Intangible assets with definite useful lives are measured at cost less accumulated amortization and accumulated impairment losses. Each intangible asset is assessed for legal, regulatory, contractual, competitive or other factors to determine if the useful life is definite. Intangible assets with definite useful lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives, which are as follows:\n\n- \u0081 Software - 5 to 10 years\n- \u0081 Contract-based intangibles - 8 to 15 years\n- \u0081 Core deposit and customer relationship intangibles - 3 to 16 years\n\nIntangible assets with indefinite useful lives are measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Indefinite-life intangible assets are tested for impairment at least annually and whenever there is an indication that the asset may be impaired. Refer to the 'Impairment of non-financial assets' policy below.",

        "page_content": "## Consolidated financial statements\n\n## Impairment of non-financial assets\n\nThe carrying values of non-financial assets with definite useful lives, including right-of-use assets, buildings and equipment, and intangible assets with definite useful lives are reviewed to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are tested for impairment at least annually, and whenever there is an indication that the asset may be impaired. If any such indication of impairment exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss, if any.\n\nFor the purpose of reviewing non-financial assets with definite useful lives for impairment, asset groups are reviewed at their lowest level for which identifiable cash inflows are largely independent of cash inflows of other assets or groups of assets. This grouping is referred to as a cashgenerating unit (CGU).\n\nCorporate assets do not generate separate cash inflows. Corporate assets are tested for impairment at the minimum collection of CGUs to which the corporate asset can be allocated reasonably and consistently.\n\nThe recoverable amount is the greater of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. Value in use is the present value of the future cash flows expected to be derived from the asset or CGU. If the recoverable amount is less than its carrying value, an impairment loss is recognized in the consolidated statement of income in the period in which it occurs. If an impairment subsequently reverses, the carrying value of the asset is increased to the extent that the carrying value of the underlying assets does not exceed the carrying value that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortization, if no impairment had been recognized. Any impairment reversal is recognized in the consolidated statement of income in the period in which it occurs.\n\nGoodwill is assessed for impairment based on the group of CGUs expected to benefit from the synergies of the business combination, and the lowest level at which management monitors the goodwill. Any potential goodwill impairment is identified by comparing the recoverable amount of the CGU grouping to which the goodwill is allocated to its carrying value including the allocated goodwill. If the recoverable amount is less than its carrying value, an impairment loss is recognized in the consolidated statement of income in the period in which it occurs. Impairment losses on goodwill are not subsequently reversed if conditions change.\n\n## Income taxes\n\nIncome tax includes current tax and deferred tax which is recognized in the consolidated statement of income, except to the extent that it relates to items recognized in OCI or directly in equity, in which case it is recognized accordingly.\n\nCurrent tax is recognized as the tax calculated as payable on the taxable profit for the year, based on the applicable laws of each jurisdiction, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted as at the reporting date, and any adjustment in respect of previous years. Current tax assets and liabilities are offset when CIBC intends to settle on a net basis and the legal right to offset exists.\n\nDeferred tax is recognized on temporary differences between the carrying value of assets and liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet and the corresponding amounts attributed to such assets and liabilities for tax purposes.\n\nDeferred tax is recognized using the tax rates that are expected to be applied to the temporary differences when they reverse, based on the laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted as at the reporting date.\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets and liabilities and they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority on the same taxable entity, or on different taxable entities which intend to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis or to realize the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.\n\nDeferred tax assets are recognized only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilized.\n\nDeferred tax is not recognized for taxable temporary differences arising from NIFO's if they are not expected to reverse in the foreseeable future and we expect to control the timing of reversal, deductible temporary differences arising from NIFOs if they are not expected to reverse in the foreseeable future and it is not probable future taxable profits will be available against which these deductible temporary differences can be utilized, temporary differences arising from the initial recognition of assets or liabilities in a transaction that is not a business combination and that affects neither accounting nor taxable income, or taxable temporary differences on the initial recognition of goodwill.\n\nWe are subject to income tax laws in the various jurisdictions where we operate, and the tax laws in those jurisdictions are potentially subject to different interpretations by us and the relevant taxation authority, which gives rise to uncertainty. For tax positions where there is uncertainty regarding the ultimate determination of the tax impact, including positions which are under audit, dispute or appeal, we recognize provisions to consider this uncertainty based on our best estimate of the amount expected to be paid based on an assessment of the relevant factors. Changes in our assessment of these factors could increase or decrease our provision for income taxes in future periods.\n\n## Pension and other post-employment benefits\n\nWe are the sponsor of a number of employee benefit plans. These plans include both defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans, and various other post-employment benefit plans including post-retirement medical and dental benefits.\n\n## Defined benefit plans\n\nThe cost of pensions and other post-employment benefits earned by employees is actuarially determined separately for each plan using the projected unit credit method and our best estimate of salary escalation, retirement ages of employees, mortality and expected health-care costs. This represents CIBC's defined benefit obligation, which is measured as at the reporting date. The discount rate used to measure the defined benefit obligation is based on the yield of a portfolio of high-quality corporate bonds denominated in the same currency in which the benefits are expected to be paid and with terms to maturity that, on average, match the terms of the defined benefit obligation.\n\nPlan assets are measured at fair value as at the reporting date.\n\nThe net defined benefit asset (liability) represents the present value of the defined benefit obligation less the fair value of plan assets. The net defined benefit asset (liability) is included in Other assets and Other liabilities, respectively.\n\nCurrent service cost reflects the cost of providing post-employment benefits earned by employees in the current period. Current service cost is calculated as the present value of the benefits attributed to the current year of service and is recognized in the consolidated statement of income. The current service cost is calculated using a separate discount rate to reflect the longer duration of future benefit payments associated with the additional year of service to be earned by the plan's active participants.\n\nPast service costs arising from plan amendments or curtailments are recognized in net income in the period in which they arise.\n\nNet interest income or expense comprises interest income on plan assets and interest expense on the defined benefit obligation. Interest income is calculated by applying the discount rate to the plan assets, and interest expense is calculated by applying the discount rate to the defined benefit obligation. Net interest income or expense is recognized in the consolidated statement of income.\n\nActuarial gains and losses represent changes in the present value of the defined benefit obligation which result from changes in actuarial assumptions and differences between previous actuarial assumptions and actual experience, and from differences between the actual return on plan",

Net actuarial gains and losses are recognized in OCI in the period in which they arise and are not subject to subsequent reclassification to net income. Cumulative net actuarial gains and losses are included in AOCI.\n\nWhen the calculation results in a net defined benefit asset, the recognized asset is limited to the present value of economic benefits available in the form of future refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan (the asset ceiling). For plans where we do not have an unconditional right to a refund of surplus, we determine the asset ceiling by reference to future economic benefits available in the form of reductions in future contributions to the plan, in which case the present value of economic benefits is calculated giving consideration to minimum funding requirements for future service that apply to the plan. Where a reduction in future contributions to the plan is not currently realizable at the reporting date, we estimate whether we will have the ability to reduce contributions for future service at some point during the life of the plan by taking into account, among other things, expected future returns on plan assets. If it is anticipated that we will not be able to recover the value of the net defined benefit asset, after considering minimum funding requirements for future service, the net defined benefit asset is reduced to the amount of the asset ceiling.\n\nWhen the payment in the future of minimum funding requirements related to past service would result in a net defined benefit surplus, or an increase in a net defined benefit surplus, the minimum funding requirements are recognized as a liability to the extent that the surplus would not be fully available as a refund or a reduction in future contributions. Any funded status surplus is limited to the present value of future economic benefits available in the form of refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan.\n\n## Defined contribution plans\n\nCosts for defined contribution plans are recognized during the year in which the service is provided.\n\n## Other long-term employee benefits\n\nCIBC offers other medical and dental benefits to employees while on long-term disability. CIBC also previously sponsored a closed long-term disability income replacement plan that was classified as a long-term defined benefit arrangement before it was settled effective December 2021.\n\nThe amount of other long-term employee benefits is actuarially calculated using the projected unit credit method. Under this method, the benefit is discounted to determine its present value. The methodology used to determine the discount rate used to value the long-term employee benefit obligation is consistent with that for pension and other post-employment benefit plans. Actuarial gains and losses and past service costs are recognized in the consolidated statement of income in the period in which they arise.\n\n## Share-based payments\n\nWe provide compensation to certain employees and directors in the form of share-based awards.\n\nCompensation expense for share-based awards is recognized from the service commencement date to the earlier of the contractual vesting date or the employee's retirement eligible date. For grants regularly awarded in the annual incentive compensation cycle (annual incentive grant), the service commencement date is considered to be the start of the fiscal year that precedes the fiscal year in which the grant is made. The service commencement date in respect of special awards granted outside of the annual cycle is the grant date. The amount of compensation expense recognized is based on management's best estimate of the number of share-based awards expected to vest, including estimates of expected forfeitures, which are revised periodically as appropriate. For the annual incentive grant, compensation expense is recognized from the service commencement date based on the estimated fair value of the forthcoming grant with the estimated fair value adjusted to the actual fair value at the grant date.\n\nUnder the Restricted Share Award (RSA) plan, where grants are settled in the cash equivalent of common shares, changes in the obligation which arise from fluctuations in the market price of common shares, net of related hedges, are recognized in the consolidated statement of income as compensation expense in proportion to the award recognized.\n\nUnder the Performance Share Unit (PSU) plan, where grants are settled in the cash equivalent of common shares, changes in the obligation which arise from fluctuations in the market price of common shares, and revised estimates of the performance factor, net of related hedges, are recognized in the consolidated statement of income as compensation expense in proportion to the award recognized. The performance factor ranges from 75% to 125% of the initial number of units awarded based on CIBC's performance relative to the other major Canadian banks.\n\nCompensation expense in respect of the Employee Stock Option Plan (ESOP) is based on the grant date fair value. Where the service commencement date precedes the grant date, compensation expense is recognized from the service commencement date based on the estimated fair value of the award at the grant date, with the estimated fair value adjusted to the actual fair value at the grant date. Compensation expense results in a corresponding increase to contributed surplus. If the ESOP award is exercised, the proceeds we receive, together with the amount recognized in Contributed surplus, are credited to common share capital. If the ESOP award expires unexercised, the compensation expense remains in Contributed surplus.\n\nCompensation in the form of Deferred Share Units (DSUs) issued pursuant to the Deferred Share Unit Plan, the Deferred Compensation Plan (DCP), and the Directors' Plan entitles the holder to receive the cash equivalent of a CIBC common share. At the time DSUs are granted, the related expense in respect of the cash compensation that an employee or director would otherwise receive would have been fully recognized. Changes in the obligations which arise from fluctuations in the market price of common shares, net of related hedges, are recognized in the consolidated statement of income as compensation expense for employee DSUs and as Non-interest expense - Other for Directors' DSUs.\n\nOur contributions under the Employee Share Purchase Plan (ESPP) are expensed as incurred.\n\nThe impact due to our changes in common share price in respect of cash-settled share-based compensation under the RSA and PSU plans is hedged through the use of derivatives. We designate these derivatives within cash flow hedge accounting relationships. The effective portion of the change in fair value of these derivatives is recognized in OCI and is reclassified into compensation expense, within the consolidated statement of income, over the period that the hedged awards impact the consolidated statement of income. The ineffective portion of the change in fair value of the hedging derivatives is recognized in the consolidated statement of income immediately as it arises.\n\n## Provisions and contingent liabilities\n\nProvisions are liabilities of uncertain timing or amount. A provision is recognized when we have a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. The provision is recognized as the best estimate of the amount required to settle the obligation at the reporting date, taking into account the risk and uncertainties related to the obligation. Where material, provisions are discounted to reflect the time value of money, and the increase in the obligation due to the passage of time is presented as Interest expense in the consolidated statement of income.\n\nContingent liabilities are possible obligations that arise from past events whose existence will be confirmed only by the occurrence, or non-occurrence, of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of CIBC, or are present obligations that have arisen from past events but are not recognized because it is not probable that settlement will require the outflow of economic benefits.\n\nProvisions and contingent liabilities are disclosed in the consolidated financial statements.",

        "page_content": "## Consolidated financial statements\n\n## Earnings per share\n\nWe present basic and diluted EPS for our common shares.\n\nBasic EPS is computed by dividing net income for the period attributable to CIBC common shareholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. The net income attributable to CIBC common shareholders is determined after deducting the after-tax amount of dividends on preferred shares and distributions on other equity instruments, which are accounted for in retained earnings, from the net income attributable to equity shareholders.\n\nDiluted EPS is computed by dividing net income for the period attributable to CIBC common shareholders by the weighted-average number of diluted common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted common shares reflect the potential dilutive effect of the exercise of stock options based on the treasury stock method. For stock options, the treasury stock method determines the number of incremental common shares by assuming that outstanding stock options, whose exercise price is less than the average market price of common shares during the period, are exercised and then reduced by the number of common shares assumed to be repurchased with the exercise proceeds from the assumed exercise of the options. Instruments determined to have an antidilutive effect for the period are excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS.\n\n## Fee and commission income\n\nThe recognition of fee and commission income is determined by the purpose of the fee or commission and the terms specified in the contract with the customer. Revenue is recognized when, or as, a performance obligation is satisfied by transferring control of the service to the customer, in the amount of the consideration to which we expect to be entitled. Revenue may therefore be recognized at a point in time upon completion of the service or over time as the services are provided. When revenue is recognized over time, we are generally required to provide the services each period, such that control of the services is transferred evenly to the customer, and we therefore measure our progress towards completion of the service based upon the time elapsed. For contracts where the transaction price includes variable consideration, revenue is only recognized to the extent that it is highly probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved, which typically occurs by the end of the reporting period. When another party is involved in providing a service to a customer, we determine whether the nature of our performance obligation is that of a principal or an agent. If we control the service before it is transferred to the customer, we are acting as the principal and present revenue separately from the amount paid to the other party; otherwise we are the agent and present revenue net of the amount paid to the other party. Consideration payable to a customer, including cash amounts payable to a customer, credits or other items that can be applied against amounts owing to us, is recognized as a reduction of revenue unless the payment to the customer is in exchange for a distinct good or service, in which case the purchase of the good or service is accounted for in the same way as for other purchases from suppliers. Our performance obligations typically have a term of one year or less, with payment received upon satisfaction of the performance obligation or shortly afterwards, and as a result there is no significant financing component and we do not typically capitalize the costs of obtaining contracts with our customers. Income which forms an integral part of the effective interest rate of a financial instrument is recognized as an adjustment to the effective interest rate.\n\nIn addition to these general principles, the following specific policies are also applied:\n\nUnderwriting and advisory fees are earned on debt and equity securities placements and transaction-based advisory services. Underwriting fees are typically recognized at the point in time when the transaction is completed. Advisory fees are generally recognized as revenue over the period of the engagement as the related services are provided or at the point in time when the transaction is completed.\n\nDeposit and payment fees arise from personal and business deposit accounts and cash management services. Monthly and annual fees are recognized over the period that the related services are provided. Transactional fees are recognized at the point in time when the related services are provided.\n\nCredit fees consist of loan syndication fees, loan commitment fees, letter of credit fees, banker's acceptance stamping fees, and securitization fees. Credit fees are generally recognized over the period that the related services are provided, except for loan syndication fees, which are typically recognized at the point in time that the financing placement is completed.\n\nCard fees primarily include interchange income, overlimit fees, cash advance fees, and annual fees. Card fees are recognized at the point in time that the related services are provided, except for annual fees, which are recognized over the 12-month period to which they relate. The cost of credit card loyalty points is recognized as a reduction of interchange income when the loyalty points are issued for both self-managed and thirdparty loyalty points programs. Credit card loyalty point liabilities are recognized for self-managed loyalty point programs and are subject to periodic remeasurement to reflect the expected cost of redemption as this expectation changes over time.\n\nCommissions on securities transactions include brokerage commissions for transactions executed on behalf of clients, trailer fees and mutual fund sales commissions. Brokerage commissions and mutual fund sales commissions are generally recognized at the point in time that the related transaction is executed. Trailer fees are typically calculated based upon the average daily net asset value of the mutual fund units held by clients and are recognized over time as the related services are provided.\n\nInvestment management fees are primarily based on the respective value of the assets under management (AUM) or assets under administration (AUA) and are recognized over the period that the related services are provided. Investment management fees relating to our asset management and private wealth management business are generally calculated based on point-in-time AUM balances, and investment management fees relating to our retail brokerage business are generally calculated based on point-in-time AUM or AUA balances. Custodial fees are recognized as revenue over the applicable service period, which is generally the contract term.\n\nMutual fund fees include management fees and administration fees, which are earned on fund management services and are recognized over the period that the mutual funds are managed based upon a specified percentage of the daily net asset values of the respective mutual funds. In certain circumstances, CIBC may, on a discretionary basis, elect to absorb certain expenses that would otherwise be payable by the mutual funds directly. These expenses are recognized in Non-interest expenses on the consolidated statement of income.\n\n## Interest rate benchmark reform\n\nVarious interest rate and other indices that are deemed to be 'benchmarks' including the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) are the subject of international regulatory guidance and proposals for reform. Regulators in various jurisdictions have advocated for the transition from IBORs to alternative benchmark rates (alternative rates), based upon risk-free rates determined using actual market transactions. Following the previous announcements by various regulators, the publication of LIBOR settings for all sterling, Japanese yen, Swiss franc and euro, as well as 1-week and 2-month USD LIBOR settings was discontinued on December 31, 2021. The publication of remaining USD LIBOR settings was discontinued on June 30, 2023. Based on the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) announcement in April 2023, the LIBOR administrator, ICE Benchmark Administration Limited, is continuing for a limited period post June 30, 2023 the publication of the 1-month, 3-month and 6-month USD LIBOR settings on a non-representative synthetic basis to support an orderly wind down of certain legacy contracts.\n\nIn December 2021, the Canadian Alternative Reference Rate working group (CARR) recommended to Refinitiv Benchmark Services (UK) Limited (RBSL), the Canadian Dollar Offered Rate (CDOR) administrator, to cease the calculation and publication of CDOR after June 30, 2024 and proposed a",

Following public consultation, on May 16, 2022, RBSL announced that it will permanently cease the publication and calculation of all remaining tenors of CDOR after June 28, 2024. Following this announcement, OSFI published its expectations for CDOR transition which is consistent with the two-stage transition approach proposed by CARR. OSFI expects all new derivatives and securities to transition to the alternative rates by June 30, 2023, with no new CDOR exposures after that date, with limited exceptions. OSFI also expects all loan agreements referencing CDOR to be transitioned by June 28, 2024, and federally regulated financial institutions to prioritize system and model updates to accommodate the use of CORRA prior to June 28, 2024. As part of its transition roadmap, CARR outlined a number of CORRA First initiatives aimed at increasing the liquidity of CORRA. As part of these initiatives, inter-dealer trading of derivatives moved from CDOR to CORRA. Earlier in 2023, CARR announced the development of 1-month and 3-month Term CORRA benchmarks, which were launched on September 5, 2023. In July 2023, CARR announced that no new CDOR or bankers' acceptance loans are to be originated after November 1, 2023. In addition, the Canadian Fixed Income Forum (CFIF) published a white paper in January 2023 on the impact of CDOR cessation on the Bankers' Acceptance market and the potential for alternative instruments, and the Bank of Canada announced in October 2023 that Bankers' Acceptances (BAs) will no longer be issued by major Canadian banks after the cessation of CDOR publication in June 2024 and outlined the CFIF recommendations for the orderly winding down of BAs by June 2024.\n\nThe IASB has addressed the impact of IBOR reform on financial reporting by issuing Phase 1 and Phase 2 amendments. We have adopted Phase 1 and Phase 2 amendments effective November 1, 2019 and November 1, 2020, respectively. Phase 1 amendments provide temporary relief for specific hedge accounting requirements to address uncertainties in the period prior to replacement of IBORs, and provide specific disclosure requirements for the affected hedging relationships. Phase 2 amendments address issues that affect financial reporting once an existing rate is replaced with an alternative rate and conclude the IASB's amendments to financial reporting standards due to the effects of interest rate benchmark reform. The Phase 2 amendments permit modifications of amortized cost financial assets and financial liabilities that are made as a direct consequence of IBOR reform and on an economically equivalent basis to be accounted for by updating the effective interest rate prospectively with no immediate gain or loss recognition. See 'Derivatives used for ALM purposes that qualify for hedge accounting' for further details on temporary relief provided by the IASB.\n\nAs IBORs are widely referenced by large volumes of derivative, loan and cash products, the transition presents a number of risks to us, and the industry as a whole. These transition risks include market risk (as new basis risks emerge), model risk, operational risk (as processes are changed or newly introduced), legal risk (as contracts are revised) and conduct risk (in ensuring clients are adequately informed/prepared). In response to the reforms to interest rate benchmarks, we have established an Enterprise IBOR Transition Program (Program), which is supported by a formal governance structure and dedicated working groups that include stakeholders from frontline businesses as well as functional groups such as Treasury, Technology and Operations, Risk Management, Legal and Finance, to manage and coordinate all aspects of the transition, including the identification and mitigation of the risks. An IBOR Steering Committee has been established with responsibility for oversight and execution of the Program. The IBOR Steering Committee manages the impact of the transition risks through appropriate mitigating actions. We also continue to engage with industry associations to incorporate recent developments into our project plan. The Program provides regular updates to the senior management including the Executive Committee and the Board.\n\nAs a part of the Program, we completed the transition of non-USD LIBOR referenced contracts in fiscal 2022 and in the third quarter of 2023, we substantially completed the transition of our USD LIBOR referenced contracts including centrally cleared derivatives, to the alternative rates in a manner that is consistent with regulatory expectations. The FCA's announcement in April 2023, that the LIBOR administrator will continue to publish certain USD LIBOR settings on a non-representative synthetic basis after June 30, 2023 for a limited period to allow market participants to use such rates in legacy contracts, only impacted our debentures amounting to US$48 million (see Note 14 for additional details). Consistent with regulatory expectations, no new derivatives or securities referenced to CDOR were originated after June 30, 2023, with limited permitted exceptions. We are in the process of transitioning our CDOR and BA based contracts to the alternative rates by incorporating appropriate fallback provisions or making amendments to contracts to reference alternative rates, and have developed business processes to support the transition. The Program continues to progress on its CDOR transition plan to ensure an orderly transition and alignment with regulators' expectations. As part of the Program, we continue to engage with industry associations on ongoing developments, and continue to incorporate these into our project plan and make information available to our clients, advising them on recent developments.\n\nThe following table presents the approximate notional amounts of our derivatives and the gross outstanding balances of our non-derivative financial assets and financial liabilities that are indexed to CDOR with a maturity date beyond June 28, 2024 that are expected to be affected by IBOR reform.\n\n|                                                              | Notional/gross outstanding amounts (2)  (1)   | Notional/gross outstanding amounts (2)  (1)   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|\n| (billions of Canadian dollars)                               | October 31, 2023 CDOR                         | October 31, 2022 CDOR                         |\n|                                                              | Maturing after  June 28, 2024                 | Maturing after  June 28, 2024                 |\n| Non-derivative financial assets                              |                                               |                                               |\n| Securities                                                   | $ 5.6                                         | $  3.4                                        |\n| Loans and customers' liability under acceptances (3)         | 30.0                                          | 20.0                                          |\n|                                                              | 35.6                                          | 23.4                                          |\n| Non-derivative financial liabilities                         |                                               |                                               |\n| Secured borrowing deposits and subordinated indebtedness (4) | 5.0                                           | 6.5                                           |\n| Other deposits and acceptances (3)                           | 10.1                                          | 7.1                                           |\n|                                                              | 15.1                                          | 13.6                                          |\n| Derivatives  (5)                                             | 2,093.7                                       | 1,757.9                                       |",

Note 1, 'Basis of preparation and summary of significant accounting policies', sets out the accounting treatment for each measurement category of financial instruments.\n\nFair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset, or paid to transfer a liability, between market participants in an orderly transaction in the principal market at the measurement date under current market conditions (i.e., the exit price). The determination of fair value requires judgment and is based on market information, where available and appropriate. Fair value measurements are categorized into three levels within a fair value hierarchy (Level 1, 2 or 3) based on the valuation inputs used in measuring the fair value, as outlined below.\n\n- \u0081 Level 1 - Unadjusted quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities we can access at the measurement date. Bid prices, ask prices or prices within the bid and ask, which are the most representative of the fair value, are used as appropriate to measure fair value. Fair value is best evidenced by an independent quoted market price for the same instrument in an active market. An active market is one where transactions are occurring with sufficient frequency and volume to provide quoted prices on an ongoing basis.\n- \u0081 Level 2 - Quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets that are inactive or observable market quotes for similar instruments, or use of valuation techniques where all significant inputs are observable. Inactive markets may be characterized by a significant decline in the volume and level of observed trading activity or through large or erratic bid/offer spreads. In instances where traded markets do not exist or are not considered sufficiently active, we measure fair value using valuation models.\n- \u0081 Level 3 - Non-observable or indicative prices or use of valuation techniques where one or more significant inputs are non-observable.\n\nFor a significant portion of our financial instruments, quoted market prices are not available because of the lack of traded markets, and even where such markets do exist, they may not be considered sufficiently active to be used as a final determinant of fair value. When quoted market prices in active markets are not available, we would consider using valuation models. The valuation model and technique we select maximizes the use of observable market inputs to the extent possible and appropriate in order to estimate the price at which an orderly transaction would take place at the measurement date. In an inactive market, we consider all reasonably available information, including any available pricing for similar instruments, recent arm's-length market transactions, any relevant observable market inputs, indicative dealer or broker quotations, and our own internal model-based estimates.\n\nValuation adjustments are an integral component of our fair valuation process. We apply judgment in establishing valuation adjustments that take into account various factors that may have an impact on the valuation. Such factors primarily include, but are not limited to, the bid-offer spreads, illiquidity due to lack of market depth, parameter uncertainty and other market risk, model risk and credit risk of our derivative assets and liabilities, as well as adjustments for valuing our uncollateralized derivative assets and liabilities based on an estimated market cost of funds curve.\n\nGenerally, the unit of account for a financial instrument is the individual instrument, and valuation adjustments are applied at an individual instrument level, consistent with that unit of account. In cases where we manage a group of financial assets and liabilities that consist of substantially similar and offsetting risk exposures, the fair value of the group of financial assets and liabilities is measured on the basis of the net open risks.\n\nWe apply judgment in determining the most appropriate inputs and the weighting we ascribe to each such input as well as in our selection of valuation methodologies. Regardless of the valuation technique we use, we incorporate assumptions that we believe market participants would make for credit, funding, and liquidity considerations. When the fair value of a financial instrument at inception is determined using a valuation technique that incorporates one or more significant inputs that are non-observable, no inception profit or loss (the difference between the determined fair value and the transaction price) is recognized at the time the asset or liability is initially recorded. Any gains or losses at inception are deferred and recognized only in future periods over the term of the instruments or when the inputs become significantly observable.\n\nWe have an ongoing process for evaluating and enhancing our valuation techniques and models. Where enhancements are made, they are applied prospectively, so that fair values reported in prior periods are not recalculated on the new basis. Valuation models used, including analytics for the construction of yield curves and volatility surfaces, are vetted and approved, consistent with our model risk policy.\n\nTo ensure that valuations are appropriate, we have established internal guidance on fair value measurement, which is reviewed periodically in recognition of the dynamic nature of markets and the constantly evolving pricing practices in the market. A number of policies and controls are put in place to ensure that the internal guidance on fair value measurement is being applied consistently and appropriately, including independent validation of valuation inputs to external sources such as exchange quotes, broker quotes or other management-approved independent pricing sources. Key model inputs, such as yield curves and volatilities, are independently verified. The results from the independent price validation and any valuation adjustments are reviewed by the Independent Price Verification Committee on a monthly basis. This includes, but is not limited to, reviewing fair value adjustments and methodologies, independent price verification results, limits and valuation uncertainty.\n\nDue to the judgment used in applying a wide variety of acceptable valuation techniques and models, as well as the use of estimates inherent in this process, estimates of fair value for the same or similar assets may differ among financial institutions. The calculation of fair value is based on market conditions as at each consolidated balance sheet date and may not be reflective of ultimate realizable value.\n\n## Methods and assumptions\n\n## Financial instruments with fair value equal to carrying value\n\nFor financial instruments that are not carried on the consolidated balance sheet at fair value and where we consider the carrying value to be a reasonable approximation of fair value due to their short-term nature and generally negligible credit risk, the fair values disclosed for these financial instruments are assumed to equal their carrying values. These financial instruments are: cash and non-interest-bearing deposits with banks; shortterm interest-bearing deposits with banks; cash collateral on securities borrowed; securities purchased under resale agreements; customers' liability under acceptances; cash collateral on securities lent; obligations related to securities sold under repurchase agreements; acceptances; deposits with demand features; and certain other financial assets and liabilities.",

        "page_content": "## Consolidated financial statements\n\n## Securities\n\nThe fair value of debt or equity securities and obligations related to securities sold short is based on quoted bid or ask market prices where available in an active market.\n\nSecurities for which quotes in an active market are not available are valued using all reasonably available market information as described below.\n\nThe fair value of government issued or guaranteed securities that are not traded in an active market is calculated by applying valuation techniques such as discounted cash flow models using implied yields derived from the prices of actively traded government securities and most recently observable spread differentials.\n\nThe fair value of corporate debt securities is determined using the most recently executed transaction prices, and where appropriate, adjusted to the price of these securities obtained from independent dealers, brokers, and third-party multi-contributor consensus pricing sources. When observable price quotations are not available, fair value is determined based on discounted cash flow models using observable discounting curves such as benchmark and government yield curves and spread differentials observed through independent dealers, brokers, and third-party multicontributor consensus pricing sources.\n\nAsset-backed securities (ABS) and mortgage-backed securities (MBS) not issued or guaranteed by a government are valued using discounted cash flow models making maximum use of market observable inputs, such as broker quotes on identical or similar securities and other pricing information obtained from third-party pricing sources adjusted for the characteristics and the performance of the underlying collateral. Other key inputs used include prepayment and liquidation rates, credit spreads, and discount rates commensurate with the risks involved. These assumptions factor in information that is derived from actual transactions, underlying reference asset performance, external market research, and market indices, where appropriate.\n\nPrivately issued debt and equity securities are valued using recent market transactions, where available. Otherwise, fair values are derived from valuation models using a market or income approach. These models consider various factors, including projected cash flows, earnings, revenue or other third-party evidence as available. The fair value of limited partnership investments is based upon net asset values published by third-party fund managers and is adjusted for more recent information where available and appropriate. The carrying value of Community Reinvestment Act equity investments and Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) stock approximates fair value.\n\n## Loans\n\nThe fair value of variable-rate loans and loans for which interest rates are repriced or reset frequently is assumed to be equal to their carrying value. The fair value for fixed-rate loans is estimated using a discounted cash flow calculation that uses market interest rates.\n\nThe ultimate fair value of loans disclosed is net of the associated allowance for credit losses. The fair value of loans is not adjusted for the value of any credit derivatives used to manage the credit risk associated with them. The fair value of these credit derivatives is disclosed separately.\n\n## Securities purchased under resale agreements or sold under repurchase agreements\n\nThe fair values of these contracts are determined using valuation techniques such as the discounted cash flow method using interest rate curves as inputs.\n\n## Other assets and other liabilities\n\nOther assets and other liabilities mainly comprise accrued interest receivable or payable, brokers' client accounts receivable or payable, derivative collateral receivable or payable, precious metals and accounts receivable or payable.\n\nThe fair values of other assets and other liabilities are primarily assumed to be at cost or amortized cost as we consider the carrying value to be a reasonable approximation of fair value, except for the fair value of precious metals, which is quoted in an active market. Other assets also include investment in bank-owned life insurance carried at the cash surrender value, which is assumed to be a reasonable approximation of fair value.\n\n## Deposits\n\nThe fair values of floating-rate deposits and demand deposits are assumed to be equal to their amortized cost. The fair value of fixed-rate deposits is determined by discounting the contractual cash flows using either current market interest rates with similar remaining terms or rates estimated using internal models and broker quotes. The fair value of deposit liabilities with embedded optionality includes the fair value of those options. The fair value of equity- and commodity-linked notes includes the fair value of embedded equity and commodity derivatives.\n\nCertain deposits designated at FVTPL are structured notes that have coupons or repayment terms linked to the performance of commodities, debt or equity securities or specific market indices. The fair value of these structured notes is estimated using internally vetted valuation models for the debt and embedded derivative portions of the notes by incorporating market observable prices of the referenced securities or comparable securities, and other inputs such as interest rate yield curves, equity prices or indices, market volatility levels, foreign exchange rates and changes in our own credit risk, where appropriate. Where observable prices or inputs are not available, management judgment is required to determine fair values by assessing other relevant sources of information such as historical data, proxy information from similar transactions, and through extrapolation and interpolation techniques. Appropriate market risk valuation adjustments for such inputs are assessed in all such instances.\n\nThe fair value of secured borrowings, which comprises liabilities issued by or as a result of activities associated with the securitization of residential mortgages, the Covered Bond Programme, and consolidated securitization vehicles, is based on identical or proxy market observable quoted bond prices or determined by discounting the contractual cash flows using maximum market observable inputs, such as market interest rates, or credit spreads implied by debt instruments of similar credit quality, as appropriate.\n\n## Subordinated indebtedness\n\nThe fair value of subordinated indebtedness is determined by reference to market prices for the same or similar debt instruments.",

        "page_content": "## Consolidated financial statements\n\n## Derivative instruments\n\nThe fair value of exchange-traded derivatives such as options and futures is based on quoted market prices. OTC derivatives primarily consist of interest rate swaps, foreign exchange forwards, equity and commodity derivatives, interest rate and currency derivatives, and credit derivatives. For such instruments, where quoted market prices or third-party consensus pricing information are not available, valuation techniques are employed to estimate fair value on the basis of pricing models. Such vetted pricing models incorporate current market measures for interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity and commodity prices and indices, credit spreads, corresponding market volatility levels, and other market-based pricing factors.\n\nIn order to reflect the observed market practice of pricing collateralized and uncollateralized derivatives, our valuation approach uses overnight indexed swap (OIS) curves as the discount rate for valuing collateralized derivatives and uses an estimated market cost of funds curve as the discount rate for valuing uncollateralized derivatives. Uncollateralized derivatives are valued based on an estimated market cost of funds curve, which reduces the fair value of uncollateralized derivative assets incremental to the reduction in fair value for credit risk already reflected through the credit valuation adjustment (CVA). In contrast, the use of a market cost of funds curve reduces the fair value of uncollateralized derivative liabilities in a manner that generally includes adjustments for our own credit. As market practices continue to evolve in regard to derivative valuation, further adjustments may be required in the future.\n\nIn addition to reflecting estimated market funding costs in our valuation of uncollateralized derivative receivables, we also consider whether a CVA is required to recognize the risk that any given derivative counterparty may not ultimately be able to fulfill its obligations. The CVA is driven off market-observed credit spreads or proxy credit spreads and our assessment of the net counterparty credit risk (CCR) exposure. In assessing this exposure, we also take into account credit mitigants such as collateral, master netting arrangements, and settlements through clearing houses. As noted above, the fair value of uncollateralized derivative liabilities based on market cost of funding generally includes adjustments for our own credit.\n\nIn determining the fair value of complex and customized derivatives, such as equity, credit, and commodity derivatives written in reference to indices or baskets of reference, we consider all reasonably available information including any relevant observable market inputs, third-party consensus pricing inputs, indicative dealer and broker quotations, and our own internal model-based estimates, which are vetted and approved in accordance with our model risk policy, and are regularly and periodically calibrated. The model calculates fair value based on inputs specific to the type of contract, which may include stock prices, correlation for multiple assets, interest rates, foreign exchange rates, yield curves, volatility surfaces, and the probability of early termination. Where observable prices or inputs are not available, management judgment is required to determine fair values by assessing other relevant sources of information such as historical data, proxy information from similar transactions, and through extrapolation and interpolation techniques. Appropriate parameter uncertainty and market risk valuation adjustments for such inputs and other model risk valuation adjustments are assessed in all such instances.\n\n## Mortgage commitments\n\nThe fair value of mortgage commitments designated at FVTPL is for fixed-rate residential mortgage commitments and is based on changes in market interest rates for the loans between the commitment and the consolidated balance sheet dates. The valuation model takes into account the expected probability that outstanding commitments will be exercised as well as the length of time the commitment is offered.",

Transfers between levels can occur as a result of additional or new information regarding valuation inputs and changes in their observability. During the year, we transferred $650 million of securities mandatorily measured at FVTPL (2022: $1,287 million) from Level 1 to Level 2 and nil (2022: nil) from Level 2 to Level 1, $933 million of securities sold short (2022: $4,532 million) from Level 1 to Level 2 and nil (2022: nil) from Level 2 to Level 1 due to changes in the observability of the inputs used to value these securities. In addition, transfers between Level 2 and Level 3 were made during 2023 and 2022, primarily due to changes in the assessment of the observability of certain correlation, market volatility and probability inputs that were used in measuring the fair value of our fair value option liabilities and derivatives.",

identified in the table above, the interrelationships between those inputs, where applicable, and the change in fair value if changing one or more of the non-observable inputs within a reasonably possible range would impact the fair value significantly.\n\nThe fair value of our limited partnerships is determined based on the net asset value provided by the fund managers, adjusted as appropriate. The fair value of limited partnerships is sensitive to changes in the net asset value, and by adjusting the net asset value within a reasonably possible range, the aggregate fair value of our limited partnerships would increase or decrease by $138 million (2022: $109 million).\n\nWhile our standalone derivatives are recorded as derivative assets or derivative liabilities, our derivatives embedded in our structured note deposit liabilities or deposit liabilities designated at FVTPL are recorded within deposits and other liabilities. The determination of the fair value of certain Level 3 embedded derivatives and certain standalone derivatives requires significant assumptions and judgment to be applied to both the inputs and the valuation techniques employed. These derivatives are sensitive to long-dated market volatility and correlation inputs, which we consider to be non-observable. Market volatility is a measure of the anticipated future variability of a market price and is an important input for pricing options, which are inherent in many of our Level 3 derivatives. A higher market volatility generally results in a higher option price, with all else held constant, due to the higher probability of obtaining a greater return from the option, and results in an increase in the fair value of our Level 3 derivatives. Correlation inputs are used to value those derivatives where the payout is dependent upon more than one market price. For example, the payout of an equity basket option is based upon the performance of a basket of stocks, and the interrelationships between the price movements of those stocks. A positive correlation implies that two inputs tend to change the fair value in the same direction, while a negative correlation implies that two inputs tend to change the fair value in the opposite direction. Changes in market correlation could result in an increase or a decrease in the fair value of our Level 3 derivatives and embedded derivatives. By adjusting the non-observable inputs by reasonably alternative amounts, the fair value of our net Level 3 standalone derivatives and embedded derivatives would increase by $105 million or decrease by $99 million (2022: increase by $128 million or decrease by $127 million).\n\nFor certain interest rate and foreign exchange derivatives, the probability of early termination was a significant Level 3 valuation input. By increasing the probability of early termination by 10%, the fair value of those derivatives in an asset position would decrease by less than $1 million, while the fair value of those derivatives in a liability position would decrease by up to $53 million.",

The change in fair value attributable to change in credit risk of these assets designated at FVTPL during the year is insignificant (2022: insignificant). The fair value of a liability designated at FVTPL reflects the credit risk relating to that liability. For those liabilities designated at FVTPL for which we believe changes in our credit risk would impact the fair value from the note holders' perspective, the related fair value changes were recognized in OCI. Changes in fair value attributable to changes in our own credit are measured as the difference between: (i) the period-overperiod change in the present value of the expected cash flows using a discount curve adjusted for our own credit; and (ii) the period-over-period change in the present value of the same expected cash flows using a discount curve based on the benchmark curve adjusted for our own credit as implied at inception of the liability designated at FVTPL. The pre-tax impact of changes in CIBC's own credit risk on our liabilities designated at FVTPL was losses of $144 million for the year and gains of $211 million cumulatively (2022: gains of $355 million for the year and gains of $316 million cumulatively). A net loss of $10 million, net of hedges (2022: a net gain of $81 million), was realized for assets designated at FVTPL and liabilities designated at FVTPL, which is included in the consolidated statement of income under Gains (losses) from financial instruments measured/ designated at FVTPL, net.\n\nThe estimated contractual amount payable at maturity of deposits designated at FVTPL, which is based on the par value and the intrinsic value of the applicable embedded derivatives, is $4,332 million higher (2022: $3,576 million higher) than its fair value. The intrinsic value of the embedded derivatives reflects the structured payoff of certain FVO deposit liabilities, which we hedge economically with derivatives and other FVTPL financial instruments.\n\n## Note  3 Significant transactions\n\n## 2023\n\n## Sale of certain banking assets in the Caribbean\n\nOn October 12, 2021, FirstCaribbean International Bank Limited (CIBC FirstCaribbean) announced that it had entered into agreements to sell its banking assets in Aruba, St. Vincent, St. Kitts, Grenada and Dominica. The sales of banking assets in Aruba, St. Vincent and Grenada were completed in February 2022, March 2023 and July 2023, respectively. The proposed transactions in St. Kitts and Dominica did not proceed and CIBC FirstCaribbean ceased its operations in Dominica on January 31, 2023. The impacts of these transactions and closures were not material.\n\nOn October 31, 2023, CIBC FirstCaribbean announced that it had entered into an agreement to sell its banking assets in Cura\u00e7ao and Sint Maarten. The transactions are subject to regulatory approvals and other closing conditions, which are expected to be finalized in fiscal 2024. The impacts upon closing are not expected to be material.\n\n## 2022\n\n## Acquisition of Canadian Costco credit card portfolio\n\nOn March 4, 2022, we completed the acquisition of the Canadian Costco credit card portfolio, which had an outstanding balance of $2.9 billion, for cash consideration of $3.1 billion. We have also entered into a long-term agreement under which we have become the exclusive issuer of Costcobranded MasterCard credit cards in Canada. The combined transaction was accounted for as an asset acquisition and included in our Canadian Personal and Business Banking SBU. On the acquisition date, we recognized credit card receivables at their fair value of $2.8 billion and an intangible asset for the purchased credit card relationships. During the fourth quarter of 2022, we finalized the purchase consideration and recognized a reduction in the intangible asset to its fair value of $236 million.",

        "page_content": "## Consolidated financial statements\n\n## Impact of acquisition of Canadian Costco credit card portfolio\n\nNo ECL allowance was recognized in the purchase equation on the acquisition date for the acquired Canadian Costco credit card portfolio as the purchased loans were initially measured at their acquisition date fair values. Instead, immediately after the acquisition date, ECL allowances were established in the Provision for credit losses in the consolidated statement of income based on classifying each acquired credit card receivable in stage 1, since the acquisition date is established as the initial recognition date of purchased performing loans for the purpose of assessing whether a SICR has occurred. On the date of acquisition, none of the acquired credit card receivables were considered to be impaired. Subsequent to the acquisition date, ECL allowances are estimated in a manner consistent with our SICR and impairment policies that we apply to loans that we originate. See Note 3 for further details on the acquisition of the Canadian Costco credit card portfolio.\n\n## Inputs, assumptions and model techniques\n\nOur ECL allowances are estimated using complex models that incorporate inputs, assumptions and model techniques that involve a high degree of management judgment. In particular, the following ECL elements are subject to a high level of judgment that can have a significant impact on the level of ECL allowances provided:\n\n- \u0081 Determining when a SICR of a loan has occurred;\n- \u0081 Measuring both 12-month and lifetime credit losses; and\n- \u0081 Forecasting forward-looking information for multiple scenarios and determining the probability weighting of the scenarios driven by the changes in the macroeconomic environment.\n\nIn addition, the interrelationship between these elements is also subject to a high degree of judgment which can also have a significant impact on the level of ECL recognized.\n\nWe continue to operate in an uncertain macroeconomic environment. There is inherent uncertainty in estimating the impact that higher levels of interest rates, the easing of inflationary pressures, events in the U.S. banking sector and geopolitical events will have on the macroeconomic environment. As a result, a heightened level of judgment in estimating ECLs in respect of all these elements, as discussed below, continued to be required.\n\n## Determining when a significant increase in credit risk has occurred\n\nThe determination of whether a loan has experienced a SICR has a significant impact on the level of ECL allowance as loans that are in stage 1 are measured at 12-month ECL, while loans in stage 2 are measured at lifetime ECL. Migration of loans between stage 1 and stage 2 can cause significant volatility in the amount of the recognized ECL allowances and the provision for credit losses in a particular period.\n\nFor the majority of our retail loan portfolios, we determine a SICR based on relative changes in the loan's lifetime PD since its initial recognition. The PDs used for this purpose are the expected value of our upside, downside and base case lifetime PDs. Significant judgment is involved in determining the upside, downside and base case lifetime PDs through the incorporation of forward-looking information into long-run PDs, in determining the probability weightings of the scenarios, and in determining the relative changes in PDs that are indicative of a SICR for our various retail products. Increases in the expected PDs or decreases in the thresholds for changes in PDs that are indicative of a SICR can cause significant migration of loans from stage 1 to stage 2, which in turn can cause a significant increase in the amount of ECL allowances recognized. In contrast, decreases in the expected PDs or increases in the thresholds for changes in PDs that are indicative of a SICR can cause significant migration of loans from stage 2 to stage 1.\n\nFor the majority of our business and government loan portfolios, we determine a SICR based on relative changes in internal risk ratings since initial recognition. Significant judgment is involved in the determination of the internal risk ratings. Deterioration or improvement in the risk ratings or adjustments to the risk rating downgrade thresholds used to determine a SICR can cause significant migration of loans and securities between stage 1 and stage 2, which in turn can have a significant impact on the amount of ECL allowances recognized.\n\nWhile potentially significant to the level of ECL allowances recognized, the thresholds for changes in PDs that are indicative of a SICR for our retail portfolios and the risk rating downgrade thresholds used to determine a SICR for our business and government loan portfolios are not expected to change frequently.\n\nAll loans on which repayment of principal or payment of interest is contractually 30 days in arrears and all business and government loans that have migrated to the watch list risk rating are normally automatically migrated to stage 2 from stage 1.\n\nAs at October 31, 2023, if the ECL for the stage 2 performing loans were measured using stage 1 ECL as opposed to lifetime ECL, the ECLs would be $724 million lower than the total recognized IFRS 9 ECL on performing loans (2022: $1,110 million).\n\n## Measuring both 12-month and lifetime expected credit losses\n\nOur ECL models leverage the data, systems and processes that are used to calculate Basel expected loss regulatory adjustments for the portion of our retail and business and government portfolios under the internal ratings-based (IRB) approach. Significant judgment is applied in leveraging the data and modelling techniques used to calculate Basel risk parameters to meet IFRS 9 requirements, including the conversion of through-the-cycle estimates to the point-in-time parameters used under IFRS 9 that consider forward-looking information. For standardized business and government portfolios, available long-run PDs, LGDs and EADs are also converted to point-in-time parameters through the incorporation of forward-looking information for the purpose of measuring ECL under IFRS 9.\n\nSignificant judgment is involved in determining which forward-looking information variables are relevant for particular portfolios and in determining the extent by which through-the-cycle parameters should be adjusted for forward-looking information to determine point-in-time parameters. While changes in the set of forward-looking information variables used to convert through-the-cycle PDs, LGDs and EADs into point-in-time parameters can either increase or decrease ECL allowances in a particular period, changes to the mapping of forward-looking information variables to particular portfolios are expected to be infrequent. However, changes in the particular forward-looking information parameters used to quantify point-in-time parameters will be frequent as our forecasts are updated on a quarterly basis. Increases in the level of pessimism in the forward-looking information variables will cause increases in ECL, while increases in the level of optimism in the forward-looking information variables will cause decreases in ECL. These increases and decreases could be significant in any particular period and will start to occur in the period where our outlook of the future changes.\n\nWith respect to the lifetime of a financial instrument, the maximum period considered when measuring ECL is the maximum contractual period over which we are exposed to credit risk. For revolving facilities, such as credit cards, the lifetime of a credit card account is the expected behavioural life. Significant judgment is involved in the estimate of the expected behavioural life. Increases in the expected behavioural life will increase the amount of ECL allowances, in particular for revolving loans in stage 2.",

        "page_content": "## Consolidated financial statements\n\nForecasting forward-looking information for multiple scenarios and determining the probability weighting of the scenarios As indicated above, forward-looking information is incorporated into both our assessment of whether a financial asset has experienced a SICR since its initial recognition and in our estimate of ECL. From analysis of historical data, our risk management function has identified and reflected in our ECL allowance those relevant forward-looking information variables that contribute to credit risk and losses within our retail and business and government loan portfolios. Within our retail loan portfolio, key forward-looking information variables include Canadian unemployment rates, housing prices, gross domestic product (GDP) growth and household debt service ratios. In many cases these variables are forecasted at the provincial level. Housing prices are also forecasted at the municipal level in some cases. Within our business and government loan portfolio, key drivers that impact the credit performance of the entire portfolio include Standard & Poor's (S&P) 500 growth rates, business credit growth rates, unemployment rates and credit spreads, while forward-looking information variables such as commodity prices and mining activity are significant for certain portfolios, and U.S. unemployment rates and U.S. GDP growth are significant for our U.S. portfolios.\n\nFor the majority of our loan portfolios, our forecast of forward-looking information variables is established from a 'base case' or most likely scenario that is used internally by management for planning and forecasting purposes. For most of the forward-looking information variables related to our Canadian businesses, we have forecast scenarios by province. In forming the base case scenario, we consider the forecasts of international organizations and monetary authorities such as the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, the International Monetary Fund, and the Bank of Canada, as well as private sector economists. We then derive reasonably possible 'upside case' and 'downside case' scenarios using external forecasts that are above and below our base case and the application of management judgment. A probability weighting is assigned to our base case, upside case and downside case scenarios based on management judgment.\n\nThe forecasting process is overseen by a governance committee consisting of internal stakeholders from across our bank including Risk Management, Economics, Finance and the impacted SBUs and involves a significant amount of judgment both in determining the forward-looking information forecasts for our various scenarios and in determining the probability weighting assigned to the scenarios. In general, a worsening of our outlook on forecasted forward-looking information for each scenario, an increase in the probability of the downside case scenario occurring, or a decrease in the probability of the upside case scenario occurring will increase the number of loans migrating from stage 1 to stage 2 and increase the estimated ECL allowance. In contrast, an improvement in our outlook on forecasted forward-looking information, an increase in the probability of the upside case scenario occurring, or a decrease in the probability of the downside case scenario occurring will have the opposite impact. It is not possible to meaningfully isolate the impact of changes in the various forward-looking information variables for a particular scenario because of both the interrelationship between the variables and the interrelationship between the level of pessimism inherent in a particular scenario and its probability of occurring.\n\nThe forecasting of forward-looking information and the determination of scenario weightings continued to require a heightened application of judgment in a number of areas as our forecast reflects numerous assumptions and uncertainties inherent in the current macroeconomic environment.\n\nThe following table provides the base case, upside case and downside case scenario forecasts for select forward-looking information variables used to estimate our ECL.\n\n|                                         | Base case                                | Base case                                                | Upside case                              |

The base case, upside case and downside case amounts shown represent the average value of the forecasts over the respective projection horizons. Our underlying base case projection as at October 31, 2023 is characterized by relatively weak real GDP growth in both Canada and the U.S. due to the higher interest rates imposed by central banks in an attempt to ease demand and bring inflation back to target levels, and a modest increase in unemployment rates in calendar 2024. Our base case continues to assume that interest rates will stay at elevated levels through the remainder of calendar 2023 and into the start of 2024, and then modestly reduce through to the end of 2024, although remaining at higher than pre-pandemic levels. Significant judgment continued to be inherent in the forecasting of forward-looking information, including our base case assumptions regarding the economic impact of higher levels of interest rates, the easing of inflationary pressures, the impact from events in the U.S. banking sector during the year and geopolitical events.\n\nThe downside case forecast continues to assume a recession and higher unemployment rates in Canada driven by a correction in the housing market, higher interest rates and lower consumer spending. The downside case forecast for the U.S. also assumes a recession from the interest rate hikes that were introduced to combat prolonged high levels of inflation. The downside forecasts also reflect slower recoveries thereafter to lower levels of sustained economic activity and unemployment rates persistently above where they stood pre-pandemic. The upside scenario continues to reflect a better economic environment than the base case forecast, particularly for the U.S.\n\nAs indicated above, forecasting forward-looking information for multiple scenarios and determining the probability weighting of the scenarios involves a high degree of management judgment. Assumptions concerning measures used by governments to combat inflation, the economic impact from higher levels of interest rates, the events in the U.S. banking sector during the year and geopolitical events are material to these forecasts.\n\nIf we were to only use our base case scenario for the measurement of ECL for our performing loans, our ECL allowance would be $284 million lower than the recognized ECL as at October 31, 2023 (2022: $248 million). If we were to only use our downside case scenario for the measurement of ECL for our performing loans, our ECL allowance would be $926 million higher than the recognized ECL as at October 31, 2023 (2022: $847 million). This sensitivity is isolated to the measurement of ECL and therefore did not consider changes in the migration of exposures between stage 1 and stage 2 from the determination of the SICR that would have resulted in a 100% base case scenario or a 100% downside case scenario. As a result, our ECL allowance on performing loans could exceed the amount implied by the 100% downside case scenario from the migration of additional exposures from stage 1 to stage 2. Actual credit losses could differ materially from those reflected in our estimates.\n\n## Use of management overlays\n\nManagement overlays to ECL allowance estimates are adjustments which we use in circumstances where we judge that our existing inputs, assumptions and model techniques do not capture all relevant risk factors. The emergence of new macroeconomic, microeconomic or political events, along with expected changes to parameters, models or data that are not incorporated in our current parameters, internal risk rating migrations, or forward-looking information are examples of such circumstances. To address the uncertainties inherent in the current environment, we continue to utilize management overlays with respect to the impact of certain forward-looking information and credit metrics that are not expected to be as indicative of the credit condition of the portfolios as the historical experience in our models would have otherwise suggested. The use of management overlays requires the application of significant judgment that impacts the amount of ECL allowances recognized. Actual credit losses could differ materially from those reflected in our estimates.",

In addition, the gross carrying amount of previously modified stage 2 or stage 3 loans that have returned to stage 1 during the year ended October 31, 2023 was $500 million (2022: $461 million), including loans that were previously subject to the client deferral programs.\n\n## Note  6 Structured entities and derecognition of financial assets\n\n## Structured entities\n\nSEs are entities that have been designed so that voting or similar rights are not the dominant factor in deciding who controls the entity, such as when any voting rights relate to administrative tasks only and the relevant activities are directed by means of contractual arrangements. SEs are entities that are created to accomplish a narrow and well-defined objective. CIBC is involved with various types of SEs for which the business activities include securitization of financial assets, asset-backed financings, and asset management.\n\nWe consolidate a SE when the substance of the relationship indicates that we control the SE.\n\n## Consolidated structured entities\n\nWe consolidate the following SEs:\n\n## Credit card securitization trust\n\nWe sell an ownership interest in a revolving pool of credit card receivables generated under certain credit card accounts to Cards II Trust (Cards II), which purchases a proportionate share of credit card receivables on certain credit card accounts, with the proceeds received from the issuance of notes. We consolidate this trust because we have the power to direct the relevant activities and have exposure to substantially all the variability of returns from the excess spread (the deferred purchase price) that we receive over time.",

        "page_content": "## Consolidated financial statements\n\nOur credit card securitizations are revolving securitizations, with credit card receivable balances fluctuating from month to month as credit card clients repay their balances and new receivables are generated.\n\nThe notes are presented as Secured borrowings within Deposits on the consolidated balance sheet.\n\nAs at October 31, 2023, Cards II held $6.7 billion of credit card receivable assets and other eligible assets of $0.2 billion with an aggregated fair value of $6.9 billion (2022: $4.5 billion with a fair value of $4.5 billion), which supported $4.0 billion of associated funding liabilities with a fair value of $4.0 billion (2022: $3.0 billion with a fair value of $2.9 billion).\n\n## Covered bond guarantor\n\nUnder the Legislative Covered Bond Programme, we transfer a pool of conventional uninsured mortgages to the CIBC Covered Bond (Legislative) Guarantor Limited Partnership (the Guarantor LP). The Guarantor LP holds interest and title to these transferred mortgages and serves to guarantee payment of principal and interest to bondholders. The covered bond liabilities are on-balance sheet obligations that are fully collateralized by the mortgage assets over which bondholders enjoy a priority claim in the event of CIBC's insolvency. We consolidate this entity because we have the ability to direct the relevant activities and retain substantially all of the variability of returns on the underlying mortgages.\n\nAs at October 31, 2023, our Legislative Covered Bond Programme had outstanding covered bond liabilities of $31.4 billion with a fair value of $31.4 billion (2022: $26.3 billion with a fair value of $26.1 billion).\n\n## Multi-seller conduit\n\nWe sponsor a consolidated multi-seller conduit in Canada that acquires direct or indirect ownership or security interests in pools of financial assets from clients and finance the acquisitions by issuing ABS and asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP). The sellers to the conduit continue to service the assets and are exposed to credit losses realized on these assets through the provision of credit enhancements. We hold all of the outstanding ABS and ABCP. As at October 31, 2023, $671 million of financial assets held by the conduit were included in Securities (2022: $525 million), of which $178 million are measured at FVTPL (2022: $178 million) and $493 million at amortized cost (2022: $347 million), and $811 million were included in Loans (2022: $1,089 million) on our consolidated balance sheet. These financial assets are related to third-party SEs and are included in the non-consolidated SEs table below.\n\n## CIBC-managed investment funds\n\nWe establish and manage investment funds such as mutual funds and pooled funds. We act as an investment manager and earn market-based management fees and, for certain pooled funds, performance fees which are generally based on the performance of the funds. Seed capital is provided from time to time to CIBC-managed investment funds for initial launch. We consolidate those investment funds in which we have power to direct the relevant activities of the funds and in which our seed capital, or our units held, is significant relative to the total variability of returns of the funds such that we are deemed to be a principal rather than an agent. As at October 31, 2023, the total assets and non-controlling interests in consolidated CIBC-managed investment funds were $264 million and $69 million, respectively (2022: $137 million and $70 million, respectively). Non-controlling interests in consolidated CIBC-managed investment funds are included in Other liabilities as the investment fund units are mandatorily redeemable at the option of the investor.\n\n## Community-based tax-advantaged investments\n\nWe sponsor certain SEs that invest in community development projects in the U.S. through the issuance of below-market loans that generate a return primarily through the realization of tax credits. As at October 31, 2023, the program had outstanding loans of $129 million (2022: $125 million). We consolidate these entities because we have the ability to direct the relevant activities and retain substantially all of the variability of returns on the underlying loans.\n\n## Non-consolidated structured entities\n\nThe following SEs are not consolidated by CIBC because we do not have control over these SEs:\n\n## Single-seller and multi-seller conduits\n\nWe manage and administer a single-seller conduit and several CIBC-sponsored multi-seller conduits in Canada and the U.S. The multi-seller conduits acquire direct or indirect ownership or security interests in pools of financial assets from our clients and finance the acquisitions by issuing ABCP to investors. The single-seller conduit acquires financial assets and finances these acquisitions through a credit facility provided by a syndicate of financial institutions. The sellers to the conduits may continue to service the assets and may be exposed to credit losses realized on these assets, typically through the provision of over-collateralization or another form of credit enhancement. The conduits may also obtain credit enhancement from third-party providers. As at October 31, 2023, the total assets in the single-seller conduit and multi-seller conduits amounted to $0.5 billion and $13.4 billion, respectively (2022: $0.6 billion and $9.3 billion, respectively).\n\nWe provide the multi-seller conduits with commercial paper backstop liquidity facilities. We may also provide securities distribution to multi-seller conduits, and to both the single and multi-seller conduits with accounting, cash management, and operations services. The liquidity facilities for the managed and administered multi-seller conduits require us to provide funding, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions with respect to the conduits, for ABCP not placed with external investors. We also may purchase ABCP issued by the multi-seller conduits for marketmaking purposes and, in respect of our U.S. ABCP conduits, hold some of the ABCP for voluntary risk retention purposes.\n\nWe are required to maintain certain short-term and/or long-term debt ratings with respect to the liquidity facilities that we provide to the sponsored multi-seller conduits in Canada. If we are downgraded below the level specified under the terms of those facilities, we must provide alternative satisfactory liquidity arrangements, such as procuring an alternative liquidity provider that meets the minimum rating requirements.\n\nWe may also act as the counterparty to derivative contracts entered into by a multi-seller conduit in order to convert the yield of the underlying assets to match the needs of the multi-seller conduit's investors or to mitigate the interest rate, basis, and currency risk within the conduit.\n\nAll fees earned in respect of activities with the conduits are on a market basis.\n\n## Third-party structured vehicles\n\nWe have investments in and provide loans, liquidity and credit facilities to third-party SEs. We also have investments in limited partnerships in which we generally are a passive investor of the limited partnerships as a limited partner, and in some cases, we are the co-general partner and have significant influence over the limited partnerships. Similar to other limited partners, we are obligated to provide funding up to our commitment level to these limited partnerships.",

        "page_content": "## Consolidated financial statements\n\n## Loan warehouse financing\n\nWe provide interim and term senior financing to third-party SEs for the purpose of future securitization. The SE is established by a third-party investor, who provides the initial investment into the SE (the equity investors). The senior financing enables the SE to purchase a loan portfolio at the direction of a collateral manager during the warehousing phase of the securitization. The senior lenders are repaid by proceeds from the issuance of debt securities to investors when the deal closes or by the cash flows from the repayment of the underlying assets held by the SE or alternative financing obtained by the investor from third-party lenders.\n\n## Community Reinvestment Act investments\n\nWe hold debt and equity investments in limited liability entities to further our U.S. Community Reinvestment Act initiatives with a carrying value of $555 million (2022: $489 million). These entities invest in qualifying community development projects, including affordable housing projects that generate a return primarily by the realization of tax credits. Similar to other limited investors in these entities, we are obligated to provide funding up to our commitment level to these limited liability entities. As at October 31, 2023, the total assets of these limited liability entities were $9.0 billion (2022: $7.9 billion).\n\n## CIBC-managed investment funds\n\nAs indicated above, we establish investment funds, including mutual funds and pooled funds, to provide clients with investment opportunities and we may receive management fees and performance fees. We may hold insignificant amounts of fund units in these CIBC-managed funds. We do not consolidate these funds if we do not have significant variability of returns from our interests in these funds such that we are deemed to be an agent through our capacity as the investment manager, rather than a principal. We do not guarantee the performance of CIBC-managed investment funds. As at October 31, 2023, the total AUM in the non-consolidated CIBC-managed investment funds amounted to $133.6 billion (2022: $133.5 billion).\n\n## Capital vehicle\n\nWe purchase credit protection from a capital vehicle on certain referenced loan assets, which issues guarantee-linked notes held only by third-party investors. We do not consolidate the capital vehicle and the underlying loan assets remain on the consolidated balance sheet.\n\nOur on-balance sheet amounts and maximum exposure to loss related to SEs that are not consolidated are set out in the table below. The maximum exposure comprises the carrying value of unhedged investments, the notional amounts for liquidity and credit facilities, and the notional amounts less accumulated fair value losses for unhedged written credit derivatives on SE reference assets. The impact of CVA is not considered in the table below.\n\n| $ millions, as at October 31, 2023                                  | Single-seller  and multi-seller  conduits   | Third-party  structured  vehicles   | Loan  warehouse  financing   | Other (1)   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|------------------------------|-------------|\n| On-balance sheet assets at carrying value (2)                       |                                             |                                     |                              |             |\n| Cash and non-interest-bearing deposits with banks                   | $  -                                        | $  -                                | $  -                         | $  362      |\n| Securities                                                          | 414                                         | 3,001                               | -                            | 580         |\n| Loans                                                               | 91                                          | 1,298                               | 6,858                        | 131         |\n| Investments in equity-accounted associates and joint ventures       | -                                           | 52                                  | -                            | 54          |\n|                                                                     | $  505                                      | $  4,351                            | $  6,858                     | $  1,127    |\n| October 31, 2022                                                    | $  740                                      | $  5,005                            | $  8,898                     | $ 601       |\n| On-balance sheet liabilities at carrying value (2)                  |                                             |                                     |                              |             |\n| Deposits                                                            | $  -                                        | $  -                                | $   -                        | $ 365       |\n| Derivatives (3)                                                     | -                                           | -                                   | -                            | 51          |\n| Other                                                               | -                                           | -                                   | -                            | 238         |\n|                                                                     | $ -                                         | $ -                                 | $    -                       | $ 654       |\n| October 31, 2022                                                    | $  -                                        | $  -                                | $    -                       | $ 45        |\n| Maximum exposure to loss, net of hedges                             |                                             |                                     |                              |             |\n| Investments and loans                                               | $  505                                      | $  4,351                            | $  6,858                     | $  765      |\n| Notional of written derivatives, less fair value losses             | -                                           | -                                   | -                            | 25          |\n| Liquidity, credit facilities and commitments                        | 13,131  (4)                                 | 2,039                               | 5,500                        | 150         |\n| Less: hedges of investments, loans and written derivatives exposure | -                                           | -                                   | -                            | (28)        |\n|                                                                     | $  13,636                                   | $  6,390                            | $  12,358                    | $  912      |\n| October 31, 2022                                                    | $  9,422                                    | $  7,643                            | $  11,598                    | $  905      |\n\nWe also hold investments in a variety of third-party investment funds, which include, but are not limited to, exchange-traded funds, mutual funds, and investment trusts.

We generally are a passive investor and are not the investment manager in any of these investment funds.

The risks include credit, interest rate, foreign exchange, prepayment and other price risks whereas the rewards include income streams associated with the assets. Due to the retention of risks, the transferred financial assets are not derecognized and such transfers are accounted for as secured borrowing transactions.\n\nThe majority of our financial assets transferred to non-consolidated entities that do not qualify for derecognition are: (i) residential mortgage loans under securitization transactions; (ii) securities held by counterparties as collateral under repurchase agreements; and (iii) securities lent under securities lending agreements.\n\n## Residential mortgage securitizations\n\nWe securitize fully insured fixed- and variable-rate residential mortgage pools through the creation of National Housing Act (NHA) MBS under the NHA MBS Program, sponsored by CMHC. Under the Canada Mortgage Bond Program, sponsored by CMHC, we sell MBS to a governmentsponsored securitization trust that issues securities to investors. We do not consolidate the securitization trust. We may act as a counterparty in interest rate swap agreements where we pay the trust the interest due to investors and receive the interest on the MBS. We have also sold MBS directly to CMHC under the Government of Canada's Insured Mortgage Purchase Program.\n\nThe sale of mortgage pools that comprise the NHA MBS does not qualify for derecognition as we retain prepayment, credit, and interest rate risks associated with the mortgages, which represent substantially all the risks and rewards. As a result, the mortgages remain on our consolidated balance sheet and are carried at amortized cost. We also recognize the cash proceeds from the securitization as Deposits - Secured borrowings.\n\n## Securities held by counterparties as collateral under repurchase agreements\n\nWe enter into arrangements whereby we sell securities but enter into simultaneous arrangements to repurchase the securities at a fixed price on a future date, thereby retaining substantially all the risks and rewards. As a result, the securities remain on our consolidated balance sheet.\n\n## Securities lent for cash collateral or for securities collateral\n\nWe enter into arrangements whereby we lend securities but with arrangements to receive the securities at a future date, thereby retaining substantially all the risks and rewards. As a result, the securities remain on our consolidated balance sheet.\n\nThe following table provides the carrying amount and fair value of transferred financial assets that did not qualify for derecognition and the associated financial liabilities:\n\n| $ millions, as at October 31                                                     | 2023             | 2023        | 2022             | 2022        |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|-------------|------------------|-------------|\n|                                                                                  | Carrying  amount | Fair  value | Carrying  amount | Fair  value |\n| Residential mortgage securitizations  (1)                                        | $  14,227        | $  13,959   | $  16,939        | $  16,540   |\n| Securities held by counterparties as collateral under repurchase agreements  (2) | 49,794           | 49,794      | 39,788           | 39,788      |\n| Securities lent for cash collateral  (2)                                         | 2,716            | 2,716       | 2,165            | 2,165       |\n| Securities lent for securities collateral (2)                                    | 24,355           | 24,355      | 30,520           | 30,520      |\n|                                                                                  | $  91,092        | $  90,824   | $  89,412        | $  89,013   |\n| Associated liabilities  (3)                                                      | $  90,901        | $  90,868   | $  88,954        | $  88,912   |",

whenever there are events or changes in circumstances which indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Goodwill is allocated to CGUs for the purposes of impairment testing based on the lowest level for which identifiable cash inflows are largely independent of cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets. The goodwill impairment test is performed by comparing the recoverable amount of the CGU to which goodwill has been allocated with the carrying amount of the CGU including goodwill, with any deficiency recognized as impairment to goodwill. The recoverable amount of a CGU is defined as the higher of its estimated fair value less cost to sell and value in use.\n\nWe have two significant CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated. The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill are allocated to each CGU as follows:\n\n|                                                    |                                                    | CGUs       | CGUs                         | CGUs      |               |\n|----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|------------|------------------------------|-----------|---------------|\n|                                                    |                                                    | Canadian   | U.S. Commercial  Banking and |           | Total         |\n|                                                    |                                                    | Wealth     | Wealth                       |           |               |\n| $ millions, as at or for the year ended October 31 | $ millions, as at or for the year ended October 31 | Management | Management                   | Other     |               |\n| 2023                                               | Balance at beginning o  f year                     | $  884     | $  4,224                     | $  240    | $  5,348      |\n|                                                    | Impairment                                         | -          | -                            | -         | -             |\n|                                                    | Adjustments (1)  Balance at end of year            | -  $  884  | 76  $  4,300                 | 1  $ 241  | 77  $  5,425  |\n| 2022                                               | Balance at beginning of year                       | $  884     | $  3,838                     | $  232    | $  4,954      |\n|                                                    | Impairment                                         | -          | -                            | -         | -             |\n|                                                    | Adjustments (1)  Balance at end of year            | -  $  884  | 386  $  4,224                | 8  $  240 | 394  $  5,348 |",

        "page_content": "## Impairment testing of goodwill and key assumptions\n\n## U.S. Commercial Banking and Wealth Management\n\nThe recoverable amount of the U.S. Commercial Banking and Wealth Management CGU (including The PrivateBank and Geneva Advisors) is based on a value in use calculation using a five-year cash flow projection approved by management, and an estimate of the capital required to be maintained to support ongoing operations.\n\nWe have determined that for the impairment testing performed as at August 1, 2023, the estimated recoverable amount of the U.S. Commercial Banking and Wealth Management CGU was in excess of its carrying amount. As a result, no impairment charge was recognized during 2023.\n\nA terminal growth rate of 4.5% as at August 1, 2023 (August 1, 2022: 4.4%) was applied to the years after the five-year forecast. All of the forecasted cash flows were discounted at an after-tax rate of 10.3% as at August 1, 2023 (12.2% pre-tax) which we believe to be a risk-adjusted discount rate appropriate to U.S. Commercial Banking and Wealth Management (we used an after-tax rate of 9.8% as at August 1, 2022). The determination of a discount rate and a terminal growth rate require the exercise of judgment. The discount rate was determined based on the following primary factors: (i) the risk-free rate; (ii) an equity risk premium; and (iii) beta adjustment to the equity risk premium based on a review of betas of comparable publicly traded financial institutions in the region. The terminal growth rate was based on management's expectations of real growth and forecasted inflation rates.\n\nIf alternative reasonably possible changes in key assumptions were applied, the result of the impairment test would not differ.\n\nEstimation of the recoverable amount is an area of significant judgment. The recoverable amount is estimated using an internally developed model which requires the use of significant assumptions including forecasted earnings, a discount rate, a terminal growth rate and forecasted regulatory capital requirements. Reductions in the estimated recoverable amount could arise from various factors, such as reductions in forecasted cash flows, an increase in the assumed level of required capital, and any adverse changes to the discount rate or terminal growth rate either in isolation or in any combination thereof.\n\n## Canadian Wealth Management\n\nThe recoverable amount of the Canadian Wealth Management CGU is based on a fair value less cost to sell calculation. The fair value is estimated using an earnings-based approach whereby the forecasted earnings are based on the Wealth Management internal plan which was approved by management and covers a three-year period. The calculation incorporates the forecasted earnings multiplied by an earnings multiple derived from observable price-to-earnings multiples of comparable wealth management institutions. The price-to-earnings multiples of those comparable wealth management institutions ranged from 6.0 to 11.6 as at August 1, 2023 (August 1, 2022: 6.4 to 10.7).\n\nWe have determined that the estimated recoverable amount of the Wealth Management CGU was in excess of its carrying amount as at August 1, 2023. As a result, no impairment charge was recognized during 2023.\n\nIf alternative reasonably possible changes in key assumptions were applied, the result of the impairment test would not differ.\n\n## Other\n\nThe goodwill relating to the Other CGUs, which includes the CIBC FirstCaribbean CGU, is comprised of amounts which individually are not considered to be significant. We have determined that for the impairment testing performed as at August 1, 2023, the estimated recoverable amount of each of these CGUs was in excess of their carrying amounts.\n\n## Allocation to strategic business units\n\nGoodwill of $5,425 million (2022: $5,348 million) is allocated to the SBUs as follows: Canadian Commercial Banking and Wealth Management of $954 million (2022: $954 million), Corporate and Other of $100 million (2022: $99 million), U.S. Commercial Banking and Wealth Management of $4,300 million (2022: $4,224 million), Capital Markets and Direct Financial Services of $64 million (2022: $64 million), and Canadian Personal and Business Banking of $7 million (2022: $7 million).\n\n## Software and other intangible assets\n\nThe carrying amount of indefinite-lived intangible assets is provided in the following table:\n\n| $ millions, as at or for the year ended October 31   | $ millions, as at or for the year ended October 31   | Contract  based  (1)   | Brand name (2)   | Total   |\n|------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|------------------|---------|\n| 2023                                                 | Balance at beginning of year                         | $  116                 | $  27            | $  143  |\n|                                                      | Impairment                                           | -                      | (27)             | (27)    |\n|                                                      | Adjustments (3)                                      | -                      | -                | -       |\n|                                                      | Balance at end of year                               | $ 116                  | $ -              | $ 116   |\n| 2022                                                 | Balance at beginning of year                         | $ 116                  | $ 24             | $ 140   |\n|                                                      | Adjustments (3)                                      | -                      | 3                | 3       |\n|                                                      | Balance at end of year                               | $ 116                  | $ 27             | $ 143   |",

        "page_content": "## Derivatives used by CIBC\n\nThe majority of our derivative contracts are OTC transactions, which consist of: (i) contracts that are bilaterally negotiated and settled between CIBC and the counterparty to the contract; and (ii) contracts that are bilaterally negotiated and then cleared through a central counterparty (CCP). Bilaterally negotiated and settled contracts are usually traded under a standardized International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) agreement with collateral posting arrangements between CIBC and its counterparties. Terms are negotiated directly with counterparties and the contracts have industry-standard settlement mechanisms prescribed by ISDA. Centrally cleared contracts are generally bilaterally negotiated and then novated to, and cleared through, a CCP. The industry promotes the use of CCPs to clear OTC trades. The central clearing of derivative contracts generally facilitates the reduction of credit exposures due to the ability to net settle offsetting positions. Consequently, derivative contracts cleared through CCPs generally attract less capital relative to those settled with non-CCPs.\n\nThe remainder of our derivative contracts are exchange-traded derivatives, which are standardized in terms of their amounts and settlement dates, and are bought and sold on organized and regulated exchanges. These exchange-traded derivative contracts consist primarily of options and futures.\n\n## Interest rate derivatives\n\nForward rate agreements are OTC contracts that effectively fix a future interest rate for a period of time. A typical forward rate agreement provides that at a pre-determined future date, a cash settlement will be made between the counterparties based upon the difference between a contracted rate and a market rate to be determined in the future, calculated on a specified notional principal amount. No exchange of principal amount takes place. Certain forward rate agreements are bilaterally transacted and then novated and settled through a clearing house which acts as a CCP.\n\nInterest rate swaps are OTC contracts in which two counterparties agree to exchange cash flows over a period of time based on rates applied to a specified notional principal amount. A typical interest rate swap would require one counterparty to pay a fixed market interest rate in exchange for a variable market interest rate determined from time to time, with both calculated on a specified notional principal amount. No exchange of principal amount takes place. Certain interest rate swaps are bilaterally transacted and then novated and settled through a clearing house which acts as a CCP.\n\nInterest rate options are contracts in which one party (the purchaser of an option) acquires from another party (the writer of an option), in exchange for a premium, the right, but not the obligation, to either buy or sell, on a specified future date or within a specified time, a specified financial instrument at a contracted price. The underlying financial instrument has a market price which varies in response to changes in interest rates. Options are transacted in both OTC and exchange-traded markets.\n\nInterest rate futures are standardized contracts transacted on an exchange. They are based upon an agreement to buy or sell a specified quantity of a financial instrument on a specified future date, at a contracted price. These contracts differ from forward rate agreements in that they are in standard amounts with standard settlement dates and are transacted through an exchange.\n\n## Foreign exchange derivatives\n\nForeign exchange forwards are OTC contracts in which one counterparty contracts with another to exchange a specified amount of one currency for a specified amount of a second currency, at a future date or range of dates.\n\nForeign exchange futures contracts are similar in mechanics to foreign exchange forward contracts except that they are in standard currency amounts with standard settlement dates and are transacted through an exchange.\n\nForeign exchange swap contracts comprise foreign exchange swaps and cross-currency interest rate swaps. Foreign exchange swaps are transactions in which a currency is simultaneously purchased in the spot market and sold for a different currency in the forward market, or vice versa. Cross-currency interest rate swaps are transactions in which counterparties exchange principal and interest flows in different currencies over a period of time. These contracts are used to manage both currency and interest rate exposures.\n\n## Credit derivatives\n\nCredit derivatives are OTC contracts designed to transfer the credit risk in an underlying financial instrument (usually termed as a reference asset) from one counterparty to another. The most common credit derivatives are CDS and certain TRS.\n\nCDS contracts provide protection against the decline in value of a reference asset as a result of specified credit events such as default or bankruptcy. These derivatives are similar in structure to an option whereby the purchaser pays a premium to the seller of the CDS contract in return for payment contingent on the occurrence of a credit event. The protection purchaser has recourse to the protection seller for the difference between the face value of the CDS contract and the fair value of the reference asset at the time of settlement. Neither the purchaser nor the seller under the CDS contract has recourse to the entity that issued the reference asset. Certain CDS contracts are cleared through a CCP.\n\nIn credit derivative TRS contracts, one counterparty agrees to pay or receive cash amounts based on the returns of a reference asset, including interest earned on these assets in exchange for amounts that are based on prevailing market funding rates. These cash settlements are made regardless of whether there is a credit event. Upon the occurrence of a credit event, the parties may either exchange cash payments according to the value of the defaulted assets or exchange cash based on the notional amount for physical delivery of the defaulted assets.\n\n## Equity derivatives\n\nEquity swaps are OTC contracts in which one counterparty agrees to pay, or receive from the other, cash amounts based on changes in the value of a stock index, a basket of stocks or a single stock in exchange for amounts that are based either on prevailing market funding rates or changes in the value of a different stock index, basket of stocks or a single stock. These contracts generally include payments in respect of dividends.\n\nEquity options give the purchaser of the option, for a premium, the right, but not the obligation, to buy from or sell to the writer of an option, an underlying stock index, basket of stocks, or a single stock at a contracted price. Options are transacted in both OTC and exchange markets.\n\nEquity index futures are standardized contracts transacted on an exchange. They are based on an agreement to pay or receive a cash amount based on the difference between the contracted price level of an underlying stock index and its corresponding market price level at a specified future date. There is generally no actual delivery of stocks that comprise the underlying index. These contracts are in standard amounts with standard settlement dates.\n\n## Precious metal and other commodity derivatives\n\nWe also transact in other derivative products, including commodity forwards, futures, swaps and options, such as precious metal and energyrelated products in both OTC and exchange markets.",

        "page_content": "## Risk\n\nIn the following sections, we discuss the risks related to the use of derivatives and how we manage these risks.\n\n## Market risk\n\nDerivatives are financial instruments where valuation is linked to changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity, commodity, credit prices, volatilities, indices or other underlying factors. Changes in value as a result of the aforementioned risk factors are referred to as market risk. Market risk arising from derivative trading activities is managed in order to mitigate risk in line with CIBC's risk appetite. To manage market\n\nrisk, we set market risk limits and may enter into hedging transactions.\n\n## Credit risk\n\nCredit risk arises from the potential for a counterparty to default on its contractual obligations and the possibility that prevailing market conditions are such that a loss would occur in replacing the defaulted transaction.\n\nWe limit the credit risk of OTC derivatives through the use of ISDA master netting agreements, collateral, CCPs and other credit mitigation techniques. We clear eligible derivatives through CCPs in accordance with various global initiatives. Where feasible, we novate existing bilaterally negotiated and settled derivatives to a CCP in an effort to reduce CIBC's credit risk exposure. We establish counterparty credit limits and limits for CCP exposures based on a counterparty's creditworthiness and the type of trading relationship with each counterparty (underlying agreements, business volumes, product types, tenors, etc.).\n\nWe negotiate netting agreements to contain the build-up of credit exposure resulting from multiple transactions with more active counterparties. Such agreements provide for the simultaneous close-out and netting of all transactions with a counterparty, in the case of a counterparty default. A number of these agreements incorporate a Credit Support Annex, which is a bilateral security agreement that, among other things, provides for the exchange of collateral between parties in the event that one party's exposure to the other exceeds agreed upon thresholds.\n\nCredit risk on exchange-traded futures and options is limited, as these transactions are standardized contracts executed on established exchanges, whose CCPs assume the obligations of both counterparties. Similarly, swaps that are centrally cleared represent limited credit risk because these transactions are novated to the CCP, which assumes the obligations of the original bilateral counterparty. All exchange-traded and centrally cleared contracts are subject to initial margin and daily settlement of variation margins, designed to protect participants from losses incurred from a counterparty default.\n\nA CVA is determined using the fair value based exposure we have on derivative contracts. We believe that we have made appropriate fair value adjustments to date. The establishment of fair value adjustments involves estimates that are based on accounting processes and judgments by management. We evaluate the adequacy of the fair value adjustments on an ongoing basis. Market and economic conditions relating to derivative counterparties may change in the future, which could result in significant future losses.\n\nThe following table summarizes our credit exposure arising from derivatives, which includes the current replacement cost, credit equivalent amount and risk-weighted amount.\n\nFor the majority of OTC derivative transactions, we use the internal model method (IMM) for the determination of the EAD, using models that simulate the underlying risk factors and reflect netting and collateral agreements. For the minority of derivative transactions where we do not have regulatory approval to use IMM, we used the standardized approach for counterparty credit risk (SA-CCR).",

        "page_content": "## Note  13 Designated accounting hedges\n\n## Hedge accounting\n\nWe apply hedge accounting as part of managing the market risk of certain non-trading portfolios arising from changes due to interest rates, foreign exchange rates, and equity market prices. See the shaded sections in 'Non-trading activities' in the MD&A for further information on our risk management strategy for these risks. See Note 12 for further information on the derivatives used by CIBC.\n\n## Interest rate risk\n\nThe majority of our derivative contracts used to hedge certain exposures to benchmark interest rate risk are interest rate swaps. For fair value hedges, we convert our fixed interest rate exposures from the hedged financial instruments to floating interest rate exposures. For cash flow hedges, we convert certain exposures to cash flow variability from our variable rate instruments to fixed interest rate exposures.\n\n## Foreign currency risk\n\nFor our fair value hedges, we mainly use various combinations of cross-currency interest rate swaps and interest rate swaps to hedge our exposures to foreign currency risk together with interest rate risk, converting our fixed foreign currency rate exposures to floating functional currency rate exposures.\n\nFor our cash flow hedges, the majority of our derivative contracts are used to hedge our exposures to cash flow variability arising from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, and mainly consist of cross-currency interest rate swaps.\n\nFor NIFO hedges, we use a combination of foreign denominated deposit liabilities and foreign exchange forwards to manage our foreign currency exposure of our NIFOs with a functional currency other than the Canadian dollar.\n\n## Equity price risk\n\nWe use cash-settled TRS in designated cash flow hedge relationships to hedge changes in CIBC's share price in respect of certain cash-settled share-based compensation awards. Note 17 provides details on our cash-settled share-based compensation plans.\n\nFor the hedge relationships described above, hedge effectiveness is assessed at the inception of the hedge relationship and on an ongoing basis, primarily using the dollar offset method. The sources of hedge ineffectiveness are mainly attributed to the following:\n\n- \u0081 Utilization of hedging instruments that have a non-zero fair value at the inception of the hedge relationship;\n- \u0081 Differences in fixed rates, when contractual coupons of the fixed rate hedged items are designated;\n- \u0081 Differences in the discounting factors between the hedged item and the hedging instruments arising from different rate reset frequencies and timing of cash flows; and\n- \u0081 Differences in the discount curves to determine the basis adjustments of the hedged items and the fair value of the hedging derivatives, including from the application of OIS and CVA to the valuation of derivatives when they are applicable.",

On July 31, 2025, and on July 31 every five years thereafter, the dividend rate will reset to be equal to the then current five-year Government of Canada bond yield plus 2.79%.\n\nHolders of the Series 43 shares had the right to convert their shares on a one-for-one basis into Non-cumulative Floating Rate Class A Preferred Shares Series 44 (NVCC) (Series 44 shares), subject to certain conditions, on July 31, 2020.

The LRCN Series 3 Notes mature on July 28, 2082, and bear interest at a fixed rate of 7.150% per annum (paid semi-annually) until July 28, 2027.

All claims of LRCN Series 3 Note holders against CIBC under the LRCN Series 3 Notes will be extinguished upon receipt of such common shares.\n\n## Limited Recourse Capital Notes (the Notes)\n\nThe Notes are compound instruments with both equity and liability features as payments of interest and principal in cash are made at our discretion, as the sole recourse of each Note holder in the event of non-payment will be limited to that holder's proportionate share of the non-cumulative Rate Reset Class A Preferred Shares Series 53, 54 and 55 held in the Limited Recourse Trust. The liability component of the Notes has a nominal value and, as a result, the full proceeds received upon the issuance of the Notes have been presented as equity on the consolidated balance sheet, and any interest payments paid thereon are accounted for as equity distributions.\n\n## NVCC conversion mechanics\n\nEach series of Class A Preferred Shares discussed above are subject to an NVCC provision, necessary for the shares to qualify as regulatory capital under Basel III. As such, the shares are automatically converted into common shares upon the occurrence of a 'Trigger Event'. As described in the Capital Adequacy Guidelines, a Trigger Event occurs when OSFI determines the bank is or is about to become non-viable and, if after conversion of all contingent instruments and consideration of any other relevant factors or circumstances, it is reasonably likely that its viability will be restored or maintained; or if the bank has accepted or agreed to accept a capital injection or equivalent support from a federal or provincial government, without which OSFI would have determined the bank to be non-viable. Each such share is convertible into a number of common shares, determined by dividing the par value of $25.00 (except, $1,000 in the case of the Series 53, 54, 55, and 56 Preferred Shares) plus declared and unpaid dividends (except for the Series 53, 54 and 55 Preferred Shares while held in the Limited Recourse Trust) by the average common share price (as defined in the relevant prospectus supplement) subject to a minimum price of $2.50 per share (subject to adjustment in certain events as defined in the relevant prospectus supplement). We have recorded the Series 39, Series 41, Series 43, Series 47, Series 49, Series 51 and Series 56 shares as equity.",

These terms provide that we may not pay dividends on our common shares at any time without the approval of holders of the outstanding preferred shares, unless all dividends to preferred shareholders that are then payable have been declared and paid or set apart for payment. Our Series 53, 54, and 55 Preferred Shares further limit the payment of dividends on the outstanding Class A Preferred Shares Series 39, 41, 43, 47, 49, 51, and 56 in certain limited circumstances.\n\nCurrently, these limitations do not restrict the payment of dividends on our preferred or common shares.\n\n## Capital\n\n## Objectives, policy and procedures\n\nOur overall capital management objective is to employ a strong and efficient capital base. We manage capital in accordance with a capital policy approved by the Board, which includes specific guidelines that relate to capital strength, capital mix, dividends and return of capital, and the unconsolidated capital adequacy of regulated entities. Capital is monitored continuously for compliance.\n\nEach year, a Capital Plan and three-year outlook are established as a part of the financial plan, and they encompass all material elements of capital: forecasts of sources and uses of capital including earnings, dividends, business growth, and corporate initiatives, as well as maturities, redemptions, and issuances of capital instruments. The Capital Plan is stress-tested to ensure that it is sufficiently robust under severe but plausible stress scenarios. The level of capital and capital ratios are monitored throughout the year including a comparison to the Capital Plan. There were no significant changes made to the objectives, policy, guidelines and procedures during the year.\n\n## Regulatory capital, leverage and total loss absorbing capacity (TLAC) requirements\n\nOur regulatory capital requirements are determined in accordance with guidelines issued by OSFI, which are based on the capital standards developed by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS).\n\nCIBC has been designated by OSFI as a domestic systemically important bank (D-SIB) in Canada, and is subject to a Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) surcharge equal to 1.0% of risk-weighted assets (RWA). OSFI also expected D-SIBs to hold a Domestic Stability Buffer (DSB) of 3.0% as at October 31, 2023, which was increased from 2.5% effective February 1, 2023. The resulting targets established by OSFI for D-SIBs, including all buffer requirements, for CET1, Tier 1 and Total capital ratios of 11.0%, 12.5%, and 14.5%, respectively. On June 20, 2023, OSFI further announced an increase to the DSB from 3.0% to 3.5%, effective November 1, 2023.\n\nRegulatory capital consists of CET1, Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital. CET1 capital includes common shares, retained earnings, AOCI (excluding AOCI relating to cash flow hedges and changes to FVO liabilities attributable to changes in own credit risk), and qualifying instruments issued by a consolidated banking subsidiary to third parties, less regulatory adjustments for items such as goodwill and other intangible assets (net of related deferred tax liabilities), certain deferred tax assets, net assets related to defined benefit pension plans as reported on our consolidated balance sheet (net of related deferred tax liabilities), and certain investments. Additional Tier 1 (AT1) capital primarily includes NVCC preferred shares, LRCNs, and qualifying instruments issued by a consolidated subsidiary to third parties. Tier 2 capital includes NVCC subordinated indebtedness,\n\neligible general allowance, and qualifying instruments issued by a consolidated subsidiary to third parties.\n\nTo supplement risk-based capital requirements, OSFI expects federally regulated deposit-taking institutions to have a leverage ratio, which is a non-risk-based capital metric, that meets or exceeds 3.5%, including a 0.5% D-SIB buffer.\n\nOSFI also requires D-SIBs to maintain a supervisory target TLAC ratio (which builds on the risk-based capital ratios) and a minimum TLAC leverage ratio (which builds on the leverage ratio). OSFI expects D-SIBs to have a minimum risk-based TLAC ratio of 21.5% plus the then applicable DSB requirement (3.0% as noted above), and a minimum TLAC leverage ratio of 7.25%. TLAC consists of regulatory capital and bail-in eligible liabilities that have residual maturity greater than one year.\n\nThese targets may be higher for certain institutions at OSFI's discretion. During the years ended October 31, 2023 and 2022, we have complied with OSFI's regulatory capital, leverage ratio, and TLAC requirements.",

CIBC Tier 1 Notes were issued on March 13, 2009. CIBC Capital Trust was not consolidated by CIBC and the senior deposit notes issued by CIBC to CIBC Capital Trust were reported as Deposits - Business and government on the consolidated balance sheet.\n\nThe Notes were structured to achieve Tier 1 regulatory capital treatment and, as such, had features of equity capital. Under the OSFI Capital Adequacy Requirements (CAR) Guideline, any Tier 1 Notes outstanding as of November 1, 2021 would not be recognized as regulatory capital. With OSFI's prior approval, on November 1, 2021, CIBC Capital Trust redeemed its remaining $300 million of Tier 1 Notes at 100% of their principal amount together with accrued and unpaid interest up to but excluding the redemption date. As a result of the redemption of the Tier 1 Notes by CIBC Capital Trust, CIBC also redeemed the corresponding senior deposit notes issued by CIBC to CIBC Capital Trust on November 1, 2021.\n\n## Note  17 Share-based payments\n\nWe provide the following share-based compensation to certain employees and directors in the form of cash-settled or equity-settled awards.\n\n## Restricted share award plan (1)\n\nUnder the RSA plan, share unit equivalents (RSA units) are granted to certain key employees on an annual basis or during the year as special grants. RSA grants are made in the form of cash-settled awards which generally vest and settle in cash either at the end of three years or one-third annually beginning one year after the date of the grant. Dividend equivalents on RSA units are paid in cash or in the form of additional RSA units to the employees at the end of the vesting period or settlement date.\n\nGrant date fair value of each cash-settled RSA unit granted is calculated based on the average closing price per common share on the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) for the 10 trading days prior to a date specified in the grant terms. Upon vesting, each RSA unit is settled in cash based on the average closing price per common share on the TSX for the 10 trading days prior to the vesting date.\n\nDuring the year, 6,687,379 RSAs were granted at a weighted-average price of $63.78 (2022: 5,656,353 granted at a weighted-average price of $73.43) and the number of RSAs outstanding as at October 31, 2023 was 18,281,700 (2022: 17,022,399). Compensation expense in respect of RSAs, before the impact of hedging for changes in share price, totalled $224 million in 2023 (2022: $247 million). As at October 31, 2023, liabilities in respect of RSAs, which are included in Other liabilities, were $829 million (2022: $973 million).\n\n## Performance share unit plan (1)\n\nUnder the PSU plan, awards are granted to certain key employees on an annual basis in December. PSU grants are made in the form of cashsettled awards which vest and settle in cash at the end of three years. Dividend equivalents on PSUs are provided in the form of additional PSUs.\n\nThe grant date fair value of each cash-settled PSU is calculated based on the average closing price per common share on the TSX for the 10 trading days prior to a date specified in the grant terms. The final number of PSUs that vest will range from 75% to 125% of the initial number awarded based on CIBC's performance relative to the other major Canadian banks. Upon vesting, each PSU is settled in cash based on the average closing price per common share on the TSX for the 10 trading days prior to the vesting date.\n\nDuring the year, 1,842,253 PSUs were granted at a weighted-average price of $64.28 (2022: 1,652,812 granted at a weighted-average price of $73.77). As at October 31, 2023, the number of PSUs outstanding, before the impact of CIBC's relative performance, was 5,762,949 (2022: 5,501,190). Compensation expense in respect of PSUs, before the impact of hedging for changes in share price, totalled $56 million in 2023 (2022: $90 million). As at October 31, 2023, liabilities in respect of PSUs, which are included in Other liabilities, were $277 million (2022: $341 million).",

        "page_content": "## Exchangeable shares\n\nAs part of our acquisition of Wellington Financial in the first quarter of 2018, equity-settled awards in the form of exchangeable shares, which vested over a period of up to five years and had specific service and non-market performance vesting conditions, were issued to selected employees. Employees received dividend equivalents in the form of additional common shares upon vesting. Compensation expense in respect of the exchangeable shares was based on the grant date fair value, adjusted for the impact of best estimates on the satisfaction of the service requirements and non-market performance conditions. At the acquisition, each exchangeable share was granted at $123.99, and the number of exchangeable shares outstanding that were not vested as at October 31, 2023 was nil (2022: 100,907). The number of exchangeable shares outstanding were not impacted by the two-for-one share split of CIBC common shares that was effective at the close of business on May 13, 2022; however, employees received additional common shares upon exchange to reflect the share split. Compensation expense in respect of exchangeable shares totalled $1 million in 2023 (2022: $3 million).\n\n## Deferred share unit plan/deferred compensation plan (1)\n\nUnder the DSU plan and DCP plan, certain employees can elect to receive DSUs in exchange for cash compensation that they would otherwise be entitled to. In addition, certain key employees are granted DSUs during the year as special grants. DSUs are generally fully vested upon grant or vest in accordance with the vesting schedule defined in the grant agreement and settle in cash on a date within the period specified in the plan terms. Employees receive dividend equivalents in the form of additional DSUs.\n\nGrant date fair value of each cash settled DSU that is not granted under the DCP is calculated based on the average closing price per common share on the TSX for the 10 trading days prior to a date specified in the grant terms. These DSUs are settled in cash based on the average closing price per common share on the TSX for the 10 trading days prior to the payout date and after the employee's termination of employment. The grant date fair value for DCP grants is based on the closing stock price on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) on the last day of the calendar quarter. Upon distribution, each DSU is settled in cash based on the average closing price per common share on the NYSE for the 10 trading days prior to the date of the distribution.\n\nDuring the year, 310,647 DSUs were granted at a weighted-average price of $64.15 (2022: 315,545 granted at a weighted-average price of $73.54) and the number of DSUs outstanding as at October 31, 2023 was 2,048,785 (2022: 2,079,118). Compensation expense in respect of DSUs, before the impact of hedging for changes in share price, totalled ($5) million in 2023 (2022: $2 million). As at October 31, 2023, liabilities in respect of DSUs, which are included in Other liabilities, were $135 million (2022: $147 million).\n\n## Directors' plans\n\nEach director who is not an officer or employee of CIBC may elect to receive: 1) the annual equity retainer as either DSUs or common shares, under the Director DSU/Common Share Election Plan and 2) all or a portion of their remuneration in the form of cash, common shares or DSUs under the Non-Officer Director Share Plan.\n\nThe value of DSUs credited to a director is payable when he or she is no longer a director or employee of CIBC or of an affiliate of CIBC, and for directors subject to section 409A of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, the director is not providing any services to CIBC or any member of its controlled group as an independent contractor. In addition, under the Director DSU/Common Share Election Plan, the value of DSUs is payable only if the director is not related to, or affiliated with, CIBC as defined in the Income Tax Act (Canada).\n\nOther non-interest expense in respect of the DSU components, before the impact of hedging for changes in share price of these plans, totalled ($1) million in 2023 (2022: ($4) million). As at October 31, 2023, liabilities in respect of DSUs, which are included in Other liabilities, were $15 million (2022: $26 million).\n\n## Stock option plans\n\nUnder the ESOP, stock options are periodically granted to certain key employees. Options provide the employee with the right to purchase common shares from CIBC at a fixed price not less than the closing price of the shares on the trading day immediately preceding the grant date. In general, the options vest by the end of the fourth year and expire 10 years from the grant date.\n\nThe following tables summarize the activities of the stock options and provide additional details related to stock options outstanding and vested.\n\n| As at or for the year ended October 31   | 2023                           | 2023                                         | 2022                          | 2022                                    |\n|------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|\n|                                          | Number  of stock  options  (1) | Weighted- average  exercise  price  (2)  (1) | Number  of stock  options (1) | Weighted- average  exercise  price  (1) |\n| Outstanding at beginning of year         | 11,438,024                     | $  57.73                                     | 10,295,854                    | $  53.34                                |\n| Granted                                  | 3,490,610                      | 59.39                                        | 2,565,310                     | 70.05                                   |\n| Exercised  (3)                           | (212,090)                      | 27.20                                        | (1,362,340)                   | 48.42                                   |\n| Forfeited                                | (28,465)                       | 62.09                                        | (60,800)                      | 56.08                                   |\n| Cancelled/expired                        | -                              | -                                            | -                             | -                                       |\n| Outstanding at end of year               | 14,688,079                     | $  58.47                                     | 11,438,024                    | $  57.73                                |\n| Exercisable at end of year               | 5,807,176                      | $  54.42                                     | 4,381,128                     | $  53.03                                |\n| Available for grant                      | 10,679,377                     |                                              | 14,141,522                    |                                         |\n| Reserved for future issue                | 25,367,456                     |                                              | 25,579,546                    |                                         |",

Model assumptions are based on observable market data for the risk-free interest rate and dividend yield, contractual terms for the exercise price, and historical experience for expected life. Volatility assumptions are best estimates of market implied volatility matching the exercise price and expected life of the options.\n\nThe following weighted-average assumptions were used as inputs into the Black-Scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of options on the date of grant:\n\n| For the year ended October 31   | 2023     | 2022     |\n|---------------------------------|----------|----------|\n| Weighted-average assumptions    |          |          |\n| Risk-free interest rate         | 3.27 %   | 1.84 %   |\n| Expected dividend yield         | 6.84 %   | 5.80 %   |\n| Expected share price volatility | 19.86 %  | 18.03 %  |\n| Expected life                   | 6 years  | 6 years  |\n| Share price/exercise price  (1) | $  59.39 | $  70.05 |\n\nFor 2023, the weighted-average grant date fair value of options was $4.41 (2022: $4.68). (1)\n\nCompensation expense in respect of stock options totalled $12 million in 2023 (2022: $21 million).\n\n## Employee share purchase plan\n\nUnder our Canadian ESPP, qualifying employees can choose each year to have any portion of their eligible earnings withheld to purchase common shares. We match 50% of the employee contribution amount, up to a maximum contribution of 3% of eligible earnings, subject to a ceiling of $2,250 annually. CIBC contributions vest after employees have two years of continuous participation in the plan, and all subsequent contributions vest immediately. Similar programs exist in other regions globally, where each year qualifying employees can choose to have a portion of their eligible earnings withheld to purchase common shares and receive a matching employer contribution subject to each plan's provisions. Employee contributions to our ESPP are used to purchase common shares from Treasury. CIBC FirstCaribbean operates an ESPP locally, in which contributions are used by the plan trustee to purchase CIBC FirstCaribbean common shares in the open market.\n\nOur contributions are expensed as incurred and totalled $60 million in 2023 (2022: $57 million).\n\n## Note  18 Post-employment benefits\n\nWe sponsor pension and other post-employment benefit plans for eligible employees in a number of jurisdictions including Canada, the U.S., the U.K., and the Caribbean. Our pension plans include registered funded defined benefit pension plans, supplemental arrangements that provide pension benefits in excess of statutory limits, and defined contribution plans. We also provide certain health-care, life insurance, and other benefits to eligible employees and retired members. Plan assets and defined benefit obligations related to our defined benefit plans are measured for accounting purposes as at October 31 each year.\n\n## Plan characteristics, funding and risks\n\n## Pension plans\n\nPension plans include CIBC's Canadian, U.S., U.K., and Caribbean pension plans. CIBC's Canadian pension plans represent approximately 90% of our consolidated defined benefit obligation. All of our Canadian pension plans are defined benefit plans, the most significant of which is our principal Canadian pension plan (the CIBC Pension Plan), which encompasses approximately 66,000 active, deferred, and retired members.\n\nThe CIBC Pension Plan provides members with monthly pension income at retirement based on a prescribed plan formula which is based on a combination of maximum yearly pensionable earnings, average earnings at retirement and length of service recognized in the plan. There is a two-year waiting period for members to join the CIBC Pension Plan.\n\nThe CIBC Pension Plan is funded through a separate trust. Actuarial funding valuations are prepared by the Plan's external actuary at least once every three years or more frequently as required by Canadian pension legislation to determine CIBC's minimum funding requirements as well as maximum permitted contributions. Any deficits determined in the funding valuations must generally be funded over a period not exceeding fifteen years. CIBC's pension funding policy is to make at least the minimum annual required contributions required by regulations. Any contributions in excess of the minimum requirements are discretionary.\n\nThe CIBC Pension Plan is registered with OSFI and the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) and is subject to the acts and regulations that govern federally regulated pension plans.",

CIBC's Canadian other post-employment plan (the Canadian post-employment plan) represents more than 93% of our consolidated other post-employment defined benefit obligation.\n\nThe Canadian post-employment plan provides medical, dental and life insurance benefits to retirees that meet specified eligibility requirements, including specified age and service period eligibility requirements. CIBC reimburses 100% of the cost of benefits for eligible employees that retired prior to January 1, 2009, whereas the contribution level for medical and dental benefits for eligible employees that retire subsequent to this date has been fixed at a specified level. The plan is funded on a pay-as-you-go basis.\n\n## Benefit changes\n\nThe CIBC Pension Plan was amended in 2023 to introduce caps on pensionable earnings based on job level effective November 1, 2023. This change was communicated to plan members in the fourth quarter of 2023 and resulted in a $73 million negative past service cost for the year ended October 31, 2023. There were no material changes to the terms of our Canadian defined benefit pension plans in 2022. Certain plan amendments were made to our other pension plans in 2023 which resulted in a past service cost and to our other post-employment plans in 2022, which resulted in a negative past service cost.\n\n## Risks\n\nCIBC's defined benefit plans expose the group to actuarial risks (such as longevity risk), currency risk, interest rate risk, market (investment) risk and health-care cost inflation risks.\n\nThe CIBC pension plan operates a currency overlay strategy, which may use forwards or similar instruments, to manage and mitigate its currency risk.\n\nInterest rate risk is managed as part of the CIBC pension plan's liability-driven investment strategy through a combination of physical bonds, overlays funded in the repo market, and/or derivatives.\n\nMarket (investment) risk is mitigated through a multi-asset portfolio construction process that diversifies across a variety of market risk drivers.\n\nThe use of derivatives within the CIBC pension plan is governed by its derivatives policy that was approved by the Pension Benefits Management Committee (PBMC) and permits the use of derivatives to manage risk at the discretion of the Pension Investment Committee (PIC). In addition to the management of interest rate risk, risk reduction and mitigation strategies may include hedging of currency, credit spread and/or equity risks. The derivatives policy also permits the use of derivatives to enhance plan returns.\n\n## Plan governance\n\nAll of CIBC's pension arrangements are governed by local pension committees, senior management or a board of trustees. However, all significant plan changes require approval from the Management Resources and Compensation Committee (MRCC). For the Canadian pension plans, the MRCC is responsible for setting the strategy for the pension plans, reviewing material risks, performance including funded status, and approving material design or governance changes.\n\nWhile specific investment policies are determined at a plan level to reflect the unique characteristics of each plan, common investment policies for all plans include the optimization of the risk-return relationship using a portfolio of multiple asset classes diversified by market segment, economic sector, and issuer. The objectives are to secure the benefits promised by our funded plans, to maximize long-term investment returns while not compromising the benefit security of the respective plans, manage the level of funding contributions in conjunction with the stability of the funded status, and implement all policies in a cost effective manner. Investments in quoted debt and equity (held either directly or indirectly through investment funds) represent the most significant asset allocations.\n\nThe use of derivatives is limited to the purposes and instruments described in the derivatives policy of the CIBC Pension Plan. These include the use of synthetic debt or equity instruments, currency hedging, risk reduction and enhancement of returns.\n\nInvestments in specific asset classes are further diversified across funds, managers, strategies, sectors and geographies, depending on the specific characteristics of each asset class.\n\nThe exposure to any one of these asset classes will be determined by our assessment of the needs of the plan assets and economic and financial market conditions. Factors evaluated before adopting the asset mix include demographics, cash-flow payout requirements, liquidity requirements, actuarial assumptions, expected benefit increases, and plan funding requirements.\n\nManagement of the assets of the various Canadian plans has been delegated primarily to the PIC, which is a committee that is composed of CIBC management. The PIC is responsible for the appointment and termination of individual investment managers (which includes CIBC Asset Management Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of CIBC), who each have investment discretion within established target asset mix ranges as set by the PBMC. Should a fund's actual asset mix fall outside specified ranges, the assets are re-balanced as required to be within the target asset mix ranges. On a periodic basis, an Asset-Liability Matching study is performed in which the consequences of the strategic investment policies are analyzed.\n\nManagement of the actuarial valuations of the various Canadian plans is primarily the responsibility of the PBMC. The PBMC is responsible for approving the actuarial assumptions for the valuations of the plans, and for recommending the level of annual funding for the Canadian plans to CIBC senior management.\n\nLocal committees with similar mandates manage our non-Canadian plans and annually report back to the MRCC on all material governance activities.",

As a result, the net deferred tax assets of $589 million (2022: $435 million) are presented in the consolidated balance sheet as deferred tax assets of $629 million (2022: $480 million) and deferred tax liabilities of $40 million (2022: $45 million).\n\nThe amount of unused operating tax losses for which deferred tax assets have not been recognized was $1,515 million as at October 31, 2023 (2022: $1,620 million), of which $756 million (2022: $742 million) relates to the U.S. region and $759 million (2022: $878 million) relates to the Caribbean region. Generally, these unused operating tax losses will expire within 3 years for the U.S. region and within 7 years for the Caribbean region.\n\nThe amount of unused capital tax losses for which deferred tax assets have not been recognized was $482 million as at October 31, 2023 (2022: $610 million). These unused capital tax losses relate to Canada.\n\n## Tax Examinations and Disputes\n\nThe CRA has reassessed CIBC's 2011-2018 taxation years for approximately $1,772 million of income taxes related to the denial of deductions of certain dividends. Subsequent taxation years may also be similarly reassessed. CIBC filed a Notice of Appeal in 2021 and the matter is in litigation. CIBC is confident that its tax filings are appropriate and will defend its position vigorously. Accordingly, no amounts have been accrued in the consolidated financial statements.\n\nIn November 2021, the Tax Court of Canada decided against CIBC on its claim of a foreign exchange capital loss and CIBC appealed the decision to the Federal Court of Appeal. In May 2023, CIBC lost its appeal at the Federal Court of Appeal. The impact of the Federal Court of Appeal decision was recognized in the second quarter of 2023, as were offsets from other adjustments. In August 2023, CIBC filed a leave to appeal application with the Supreme Court of Canada. As previously disclosed, CIBC has potential aggregate exposure of approximately $100 million in respect of other similar matters, and no amounts have been accrued in the consolidated financial statements.\n\nIn prior years, the CRA issued reassessments disallowing the deduction of Enron settlement payments and related legal expenses (the Enron expenses). The CRA later entered into a settlement agreement with CIBC in respect to the portion of the Enron expenses deductible in Canada. CIBC has been working with the Internal Revenue Service to settle the portion of the Enron expenses deductible in the U.S. It is possible that adjustments may be required to the amount of tax benefits recognized in the U.S.\n\n## Canadian Federal Tax Measures\n\nIn the first quarter of 2023, the Canadian federal government enacted the one-time 15% Canada Recovery Dividend (CRD) tax and permanent corporate tax rate increase of 1.5% on banks and life insurer groups. The CRD tax is based on the average of 2020 and 2021 taxable income in excess of $1.0 billion and is payable over a five-year period in equal increments. The 1.5% tax rate increase applies to taxable income in excess of $100 million and is prorated for the first taxation year that ends after April 7, 2022. In its first quarter, CIBC recognized income tax expense of $510 million based on the present value of the estimated amount of the CRD tax of $555 million. The discount of $45 million accretes over the four-year payment period from initial recognition. CIBC also recognized income tax expense of $35 million for the effect of the 1.5% tax rate increase on the 2022 taxation year in the\n\n## first quarter.\n\nIn the second quarter of 2023, the Department of Finance Canada released certain proposed tax measures as part of the 2023 Canadian Federal budget, which would impact Canadian banks. These proposals included the denial of the deduction of dividends received by financial institutions on",

CIBC recognized a GST expense charge of $34 million for prior periods in respect of this measure.\n\nOn August 4, 2023, the Department of Finance Canada released draft legislation to implement certain previously announced measures including the 2% buyback tax as well as the new Global Minimum Tax Act imposing a 15% global minimum tax further to the OECD's two-pillar plan (OECD Pillar Two). The Budget 2023 Dividend Proposal was not included in the August release. The 2023 Fall Economic Statement, released on November 21, 2023, included a proposal to exclude taxable preferred shares from the application of the Budget 2023 Dividend Proposal.

In addition, there are certain exposures for which we could be obligated to extend credit that are not recorded on the consolidated balance sheet. Our policy of requiring collateral or other security to support credit-related arrangements and the types of security held is generally the same as for loans. The contract amounts presented below for credit-related arrangements represent the maximum amount of additional credit that we could be obligated to extend. The contract amounts also represent the additional credit risk amounts should the contracts be fully drawn, the counterparties default and any collateral held proves to be of no value. As many of these arrangements will expire or terminate without being drawn upon, the contract amounts are not necessarily indicative of future cash requirements or actual risk of loss.\n\n| $ millions, as at October 31                 | 2023             | 2022             |\n|----------------------------------------------|------------------|------------------|\n|                                              | Contract amounts | Contract amounts |\n| Securities lending (1)                       | $  54,899        | $  53,008        |\n| Unutilized credit commitments  (2)           | 358,916          | 336,261          |\n| Backstop liquidity facilities                | 19,314           | 12,855           |\n| Standby and performance letters of credit    | 20,204           | 18,459           |\n| Documentary and commercial letters of credit | 203              | 209              |\n| Other commitments to extend credit           | 1,704            | 718              |\n|                                              | $  455,240       | $  421,510       |\n\nIn addition, the client securities lending of the joint ventures which CIBC has with The Bank of New York Mellon totalled $79.5 billion (2022: $90.5 billion), of which $6.6 billion (2022: $9.5 billion) are transactions between CIBC and the joint ventures.\n\nCIBC has provided indemnities to customers of the joint ventures in respect of securities lending transactions with third parties amounting to $68.4 billion (2022: $77.0 billion).\n\nFor further information on the joint ventures, see Note 25.\n\n## Securities lending\n\nSecurities lending represents our credit exposure when we lend our own or our clients' securities to a borrower and the borrower defaults on the redelivery obligation.

        "page_content": "## Consolidated financial statements\n\n## Unutilized credit commitments\n\nUnutilized credit commitments are the undrawn portion of lending facilities that we have approved to meet the requirements of clients. These lines may include various conditions that must be satisfied prior to drawdown and include facilities extended in connection with contingent acquisition financing. The credit risk associated with these lines arises from the possibility that a commitment will be drawn down as a loan at some point in the future, prior to the expiry of the commitment. The amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary, is based on our credit evaluation of the borrower and may include a charge over the present and future assets of the borrower.\n\n## Backstop liquidity facilities\n\nWe provide irrevocable backstop liquidity facilities primarily to ABCP conduits. We are the financial services agent for some of these conduits, while other conduits are administered by third parties. The liquidity facilities for our sponsored ABCP programs, Safe Trust, Sure Trust, Sound Trust and Stable Trust, require us to provide funding to fund non-defaulted assets, subject to the satisfaction of certain limited conditions with respect to the conduits.\n\n## Standby and performance letters of credit\n\nThese represent an irrevocable obligation to make payments to third parties in the event that clients are unable to meet their contractual financial or performance obligations. The credit risk associated with these instruments is essentially the same as that involved in extending irrevocable loan commitments to clients. The amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary, is based on our credit evaluation of the borrower and may include a charge over present and future assets of the borrower.\n\n## Documentary and commercial letters of credit\n\nDocumentary and commercial letters of credit are short-term instruments issued on behalf of a client, authorizing a third-party, such as an exporter, to draw drafts on CIBC up to a specified amount, subject to specific terms and conditions. We are at risk for any drafts drawn that are not ultimately settled by the client; however, the amounts drawn are collateralized by the related goods.\n\n## Other commitments to extend credit\n\nThese represent other commitments to extend credit, and primarily include forward-dated securities financing trades in the form of securities purchased under resale agreements with various counterparties that are executed on or before the end of our reporting period and that settle shortly after period end, usually within five business days.\n\n## Other commitments\n\nAs an investor in merchant banking activities, we enter into commitments to fund external private equity funds. In connection with these activities, we had commitments to invest up to $581 million (2022: $462 million).\n\nIn addition, we act as underwriter for certain new issuances under which we alone or together with a syndicate of financial institutions purchase these new issuances for resale to investors. As at October 31, 2023, the related underwriting commitments were $12 million (2022: $936 million).\n\n## Guarantees and other indemnification agreements\n\n## Guarantees\n\nA guarantee is a contract that requires the issuer to make specified payments to reimburse the holder for a loss it incurs because a specified debtor failed to make payment when due in accordance with the original or modified terms of a debt instrument. Guarantees include standby and performance letters of credit as discussed above, and credit derivatives protection sold, as discussed in Note 12.\n\n## Other indemnification agreements\n\nIn the ordinary course of business, we enter into contractual arrangements under which we may agree to indemnify the counterparty to such arrangement from any losses relating to a breach of representations and warranties, a failure to perform certain covenants, or for claims or losses arising from certain external events as outlined within the particular contract. This may include, for example, losses arising from changes in tax legislation, litigation, or claims relating to past performance. In addition, we indemnify each of our directors and officers to the extent permitted by law, against any and all claims or losses (including any amounts paid in settlement of any such claims) incurred as a result of their service to CIBC. In most indemnities, maximum loss clauses are generally not provided for, and as a result, no defined limit of the maximum potential liability exists. Amounts are accrued when we have a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, when it is both probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to resolve the matter, and when a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. We believe that the likelihood of the conditions arising to trigger obligations under these contract arrangements is remote. Historically, any payments made in respect of these contracts have not been significant. Amounts related to these indemnifications, representations, and warranties reflected within the consolidated financial statements as at October 31, 2023 and 2022 are not significant.\n\n## Pledged assets\n\nIn the normal course of business, on- and off-balance sheet assets are pledged as collateral for various activities.

        "page_content": "## Note  22 Contingent liabilities and provisions\n\nIn the ordinary course of its business, CIBC is a party to a number of legal proceedings, including regulatory investigations, in which claims for substantial monetary damages are asserted against CIBC and its subsidiaries. Legal provisions are established if, in the opinion of management, it is both probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to resolve the matter, and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. If the reliable estimate of probable loss involves a range of potential outcomes within which a specific amount appears to be a better estimate, that amount is accrued. If no specific amount within the range of potential outcomes appears to be a better estimate than any other amount, the mid-point in the range is accrued. In some instances, however, it is not possible either to determine whether an obligation is probable or to reliably estimate the amount of loss, in which case no accrual can be made.\n\nWhile there is inherent difficulty in predicting the outcome of legal proceedings, based on current knowledge and in consultation with legal counsel, we do not expect the outcome of these matters, individually or in aggregate, to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements. However, the outcome of these matters, individually or in aggregate, may be material to our operating results for a particular reporting period. We regularly assess the adequacy of CIBC's litigation accruals and make the necessary adjustments to incorporate new information as it becomes available.\n\nCIBC considers losses to be reasonably possible when they are neither probable nor remote. It is reasonably possible that CIBC may incur losses in addition to the amounts recorded when the loss accrued is the mid-point of a range of reasonably possible losses, or the potential loss pertains to a matter in which an unfavourable outcome is reasonably possible but not probable.\n\nCIBC believes the estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses, in excess of the amounts accrued, for its significant legal proceedings, where it is possible to make such an estimate, is from nil to approximately $0.6 billion as at October 31, 2023. This estimated aggregate range of reasonably possible losses is based upon currently available information for those significant proceedings in which CIBC is involved, taking into account CIBC's best estimate of such losses for those cases for which an estimate can be made. CIBC's estimate involves significant judgment, given the varying stages of the proceedings and the existence of multiple defendants in many of such proceedings whose share of the liability has yet to be determined. The range does not include potential punitive damages. The matters underlying the estimated range as at October 31, 2023 consist of the significant legal matters disclosed below. The matters underlying the estimated range will change from time to time, and actual losses may vary significantly from the current estimate. For certain matters, CIBC does not believe that an estimate can currently be made as many of them are in preliminary stages and certain matters have no specific amount claimed. Consequently, these matters are not included in the range.\n\nThe following is a description of CIBC's significant legal proceedings, which we intend to vigorously defend.\n\n## Fresco v. Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce\n\n## Gaudet v. Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce\n\nIn June 2007, two proposed class actions were filed against CIBC in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice ( Fresco ) and in the Quebec Superior Court ( Gaudet ). Each made identical claims for unpaid overtime for full-time, part-time, and retail frontline non-management employees. The Ontario action sought $500 million in damages plus $100 million in punitive damages for all employees in Canada, while the Quebec action was limited to employees in Quebec and was stayed pending the outcome of the Ontario action. In June 2009, in the Ontario action, the motion judge denied certification of the matter as a class action. In September 2010, the Ontario Divisional Court upheld the motion judge's denial of the plaintiff's certification motion and the award of costs to CIBC by a two-to-one majority. In January 2011, the Ontario Court of Appeal granted the plaintiff leave to appeal the decision denying certification. In June 2012, the Ontario Court of Appeal overturned the lower court and granted certification of the matter as a class action. The Supreme Court of Canada released its decision in March 2013 denying CIBC leave to appeal certification of the matter as a class action, and denying the plaintiff's cross appeal on aggregate damages. The motions for summary judgment on liability were heard in December 2019. In March 2020, the court found CIBC liable for unpaid overtime. CIBC appealed the liability decision. A decision on remedies was released in August 2020 and the court certified aggregate damages as a common issue and directed that the availability and quantum, if any, of aggregate damages be determined at a later date. The plaintiffs' claim for punitive damages was dismissed. In October 2020, the court released its decision on limitation periods finding that limitation periods could not be determined on a class-wide basis. CIBC appealed the decisions on remedies and limitation periods. The appeal was heard in September 2021. In February 2022, CIBC's appeal was dismissed. In October 2022, a settlement agreement was reached, subject to court approval. In March 2023 and May 2023, the settlement was approved in Ontario and Quebec, respectively. Pursuant to the settlement, CIBC has paid the plaintiffs $153 million. This matter is now closed.\n\n## Mortgage prepayment class actions:\n\nLamarre v. CIBC Mortgages Inc.\n\nHaroch v. Toronto Dominion Bank, et al.\n\nIn 2011, a proposed class action was filed in the Superior Court of Quebec ( Lamarre ) against CIBC Mortgages Inc. The representative plaintiff alleged that since 2005, CIBC Mortgages Inc. wrongfully charged or overcharged mortgage prepayment penalties and that the calculation clauses in the mortgage contract that provide for discretion in applying the prepayment penalties are void and unenforceable at law. In May 2018, another proposed class action ( Haroch ) was filed in the Superior Court of Quebec against CIBC, CIBC Mortgages Inc. and several other financial institutions. The action was brought on behalf of Quebec residents who during the class period allegedly paid a mortgage prepayment charge in excess of three months' interest. The plaintiffs alleged that the defendants created complex prepayment formulas that were contrary to the Quebec Civil Code , the Quebec Consumer Protection Act and the Interest Act and sought damages back to 2015. Haroch and Lamarre were consolidated. The motion for class certification in Haroch was heard in June 2019, and in July 2019, the court certified the matter as a class action against CIBC and CIBC Mortgages Inc. CIBC and CIBC Mortgages Inc. sought leave to appeal the certification decision. The appeal of the certification decision in Haroch did not proceed as the matter was settled against CIBC, subject to court approval. In March 2023, the settlement in Haroch was approved. This matter is now closed.\n\n## Cerberus Capital Management L.P. v. CIBC\n\nIn November 2015, Securitized Asset Funding 2011-2, LTD., a special purpose investment vehicle affiliated with Cerberus Capital Management L.P. (collectively, Cerberus), commenced a New York State Court action against CIBC seeking unspecified damages of 'at least hundreds of millions of dollars'. The action related to two transactions in 2008 and 2011 in which CIBC issued a limited recourse note and certificate to Cerberus which significantly reduced CIBC's exposure to the U.S. residential real estate market. The complaint alleged that CIBC breached its contracts with Cerberus by failing to appropriately calculate and pay with respect to two of the payment streams due under the 2008 note and 2011 certificate. In September 2021, CIBC filed a motion for summary judgment, which was heard in December 2021, and denied. The non-jury trial proceeded in March 2022. The court reserved its decision. The trial decision was released on December 1, 2022 finding CIBC liable. A damages hearing proceeded on December 19,",

On February 6, 2023, the court entered the final judgment in the amount of US$856 million including pre-judgment interest as of February 6, 2023. Post-judgment interest would have accrued on the amount of the final judgment. In February 2023, the parties settled this matter. Pursuant to the settlement, CIBC paid US$770 million ($1,055 million pre-tax or $762 million after-tax) to Cerberus in full satisfaction of the judgment. This matter is now closed.\n\n## Order Execution Only class actions:\n\nPozgaj v. CIBC and CIBC Trust\n\nFrayce v. BMO Investorline Inc., et al.\n\nMichaud v. BBS Securities Inc., et al.\n\nCiardullo v. 1832 Asset Management L.P., et al.\n\nCiardullo and Aggarwal v. 1832 Asset Management L.P., et al.\n\nWoodard v. CIBC and CIBC Trust\n\nIn September 2018, a proposed class action ( Pozgaj ) was filed in the Ontario Superior Court against CIBC and CIBC Trust. It alleges that the defendants should not have paid mutual fund trailing commissions to order execution only dealers. The action is brought on behalf of all persons who held units of CIBC mutual funds through order execution only dealers and seeks $200 million in damages. The certification motion in Pozgaj that was scheduled for October 2023 has been adjourned.\n\nIn 2020, two proposed class actions were filed in the Ontario Superior Court ( Frayce ) and the Supreme Court of British Columbia ( Michaud ) against CIBC Investor Services Inc. and several other dealers. The proposed actions allege that the defendants should not have received and accepted trailing commissions for service and advice on mutual funds purchased through their respective order execution only dealers. The proposed actions are brought on behalf of all persons who purchased units of mutual funds through an order execution only dealer owned by one or more of the defendants and seeks unspecified compensatory and punitive damages. The Michaud action has been stayed. The motion for certification in Frayce was heard in September 2022, and in January 2023, the court released its decision dismissing the motion for certification. The plaintiffs are appealing the certification decision in Frayce , which is scheduled for December 2023.\n\nIn July and August 2022, two proposed class actions ( Ciardullo and Ciardullo and Aggarwal ) were filed in the Ontario Superior Court against CIBC, CIBC Trust and several other financial institutions. Like the Pozgaj action, these actions allege that the defendants should not have paid mutual fund trailing commissions to order execution only dealers. However, the actions are brought on behalf of all persons who held units of CIBC mutual funds through dealers other than order execution only dealers. They seek unspecified damages. In November 2022, a further proposed class action ( Woodard ) was filed in the Ontario Superior Court with a new proposed representative plaintiff. Woodard raises identical allegations to Ciardullo and Ciardullo and Aggarwal , on behalf of an identical class, but only names CIBC and CIBC Trust as defendants. In August 2023, the Ciardullo , Ciardullo and Aggarwal , and Woodard actions were temporarily stayed pending a decision on liability in the Pozgaj action.\n\n## York County on Behalf of the County of York Retirement Fund v. Rambo, et al.\n\nIn February 2019, a class action complaint was filed in the Northern District of California against the directors, certain officers and the underwriters of several senior note offerings of the Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E) that took place between March 2016 and April 2018, the total issuance amount for the series of offerings being approximately US$4 billion. CIBC World Markets Corp. was part of the underwriting syndicate for an offering, whereby CIBC World Markets Corp. underwrote 6% of a US$650 million December 2016 issuance of senior notes. The offering involved the issuance of two tranches of notes: US$400 million of 30-year senior notes maturing in December 2046 and US$250 million of one-year floating rate notes that matured and were repaid in November 2017. The complaint alleges that the disclosure documentation associated with the note offerings contained misrepresentations and/or omissions of material facts, including with respect to PG&E's failure to comply with various safety regulations, vegetation management programs and requirements, as well as understating the extent to which its equipment has allegedly caused multiple fires in California, including before the wildfires that occurred in California in 2017 and 2018. In October 2019, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss.\n\n## Pope v. CIBC, CIBC Trust, and CIBC Asset Management Inc.\n\nIn August 2020, a proposed class action was filed in the Supreme Court of British Columbia against CIBC and CIBC Trust. The action alleges that the defendants misrepresented their investment strategy and charged unitholders excess fees in relation to certain CIBC mutual funds and certain CIBC portfolio funds. The action is brought on behalf of all persons who hold or held units of these funds from January 2005 to present and seeks unspecified compensatory and punitive damages. In December 2020, CIBC Asset Management Inc. was added as a defendant. The motion for class certification was heard in August 2021. In October 2022, the court ruled that the plaintiff was required to provide additional information before a final determination on certification could be made. In January 2023, the plaintiffs delivered a draft amended Statement of Claim. The motion to rule on the plaintiffs' proposed amendments to the Statement of Claim, which was scheduled for July 2023, has been adjourned.\n\n## Salko v. CIBC Investor Services Inc., et al.\n\nIn March 2021, a proposed class action was commenced in Quebec against CIBC Investor Services Inc. and several other financial institutions. The plaintiff subsequently added CIBC World Markets Inc. and additional financial institutions as defendants. The action seeks the reimbursement of currency conversion fees alleged to have been unlawfully charged to class members and concealed by the defendants, as well as exemplary and punitive damages. The plaintiffs seek reimbursement of fees charged to clients since March 15, 2018, as well as punitive damages in the amount of 5% of the total sum of fees charged to class members, plus interest. The certification motion was heard in April 2022. In September 2022, the action was certified against CIBC Investor Services Inc. and several other order execution only dealers, and not certified against the full service brokerages, including CIBC World Markets Inc. The plaintiffs are appealing the certification decision. The plaintiffs' appeal of the certification decision is scheduled for December 2023.",

His Majesty The King\n\nCIBC Trust Corporation is the trustee of a self-directed RRSP that has been the subject of proceedings in the Tax Court of Canada. The proceedings arise from appeals of tax assessments made by the Minister of National Revenue against the RRSP for the 2004 to 2009 taxation years under Parts I and XI.1 of the Income Tax Act (Canada). At the time they were made in March 2013, the Part I assessment amounted to approximately $139 million and the Part XI.1 reassessment totalled approximately $144 million, in each case including all taxes, penalties and interest. In April 2021, the Tax Court of Canada released a decision allowing the appeal in part of the assessment under Part I and dismissing the appeal of the reassessment under Part XI.1. The RRSP by its trustee CIBC Trust has appealed this decision to the Federal Court of Appeal. To the extent there is a shortfall in the RRSP's ability to satisfy any of the Part XI.1 reassessment that may be upheld by the courts, CIBC Trust may be liable to pay a portion of that reassessment. The appeal was heard in May 2023. The court reserved its decision.\n\n## Non-sufficient funds fees class actions:\n\nVaillancourt-Thivierge v. Bank of Montreal, et al.\n\n## Campbell v. CIBC\n\nIn September 2016, a proposed class action ( Vaillancourt-Thivierge ) was commenced in Quebec against CIBC and several other financial institutions with respect to charging non-sufficient funds fees (NSF Fees) for client payment orders refused due to insufficient funds. The action alleges that NSF Fees violate the Quebec Consumer Protection Act and the Quebec Civil Code. The action is brought on behalf of residents of Quebec who paid NSF fees from September 12, 2013 to present. The action seeks the return of NSF fees charged as well as punitive damages of $300 per class member. The court certified the matter as a class action in 2019.\n\nIn September 2022, a proposed class action ( Campbell ) was commenced in Ontario against CIBC on behalf of personal deposit accountholders who have been charged duplicative non-sufficient fund fees (representment NSF Fees) on their account for a single rejected payment order or cheque. The action alleges that this practice violates our account agreement with clients, the Ontario Consumer Protection Act and other consumer protection statutes. The action is brought on behalf of residents of Canada who paid representment NSF Fees from January 1, 2012 to present. The action seeks the return of the representment NSF Fees charged, as well as punitive damages. The motion for certification scheduled for November 2023 has been adjourned to February 2024.\n\n## Legal provisions\n\nThe following table presents changes in our legal provisions:\n\n| $ millions, for the year ended October 31                | 2023    | 2022   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|---------|--------|\n| Balance at beginning of year                             | $  275  | $  301 |\n| Additional new provisions recognized                     | 1,098   | 151    |\n| Less:                                                    |         |        |\n| Amounts incurred and charged against existing provisions | (1,198) | (172)  |\n| Unused amounts reversed and other adjustments  (1)       | (35)    | (5)    |\n| Balance at end of year                                   | $  140  | $  275 |\n\n## Restructuring\n\nThe following table presents changes in the restructuring provision:\n\n| $ millions, for the year ended October 31                | 2023   | 2022   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Balance at beginning of year                             | $  35  | $  99  |\n| Additional new provisions recognized                     | 6      | 6      |\n| Less:                                                    |        |        |\n| Amounts incurred and charged against existing provisions | (27)   | (59)   |\n| Unused amounts reversed                                  | (4)    | (11)   |\n| Balance at end of year                                   | $ 10   | $  35  |\n\nThe amount of $10 million as at October 31, 2023 primarily represents obligations related to ongoing payments as a result of the restructurings.",

Items not subject to the credit risk framework include exposures that are subject to the market risk framework, amounts that are not subject to capital requirements or are subject to deduction from capital, and amounts relating to CIBC's insurance subsidiaries, which are excluded from the scope of regulatory consolidation.\n\n| $ millions, as at October 31   | $ millions, as at October 31                 | IRB  approach  (1)   | Standardized  approach   | Other  credit risk  (2)   | Total  subject to  credit risk   | Not  subject to  credit risk   | Total  consolidated  balance sheet   |\n|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|----------------------|--------------------------|---------------------------|----------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------------|\n| 2023                           | Cash and deposits with banks                 | $  39,692            | $  13,798                | $  2,228                  | $  55,718                        | $  -                           | $  55,718                            |\n|                                | Securities                                   | 129,320              | 16,070                   | -                         | 145,390                          | 65,958                         | 211,348                              |\n|                                | Cash collateral on securities borrowed       | 14,571               | 80                       | -                         | 14,651                           | -                              | 14,651                               |\n|                                | Securities purchased under resale agreements | 80,184               | -                        | -                         | 80,184                           | -                              | 80,184                               |\n|                                | Loans                                        | 467,047              | 60,868                   | 1,620                     | 529,535                          | 3,704                          | 533,239                              |\n|                                | Allowance for credit losses                  | (3,078)              | (824)                    | -                         | (3,902)                          | -                              | (3,902)                              |\n|                                | Derivative instruments                       | 33,243               | -                        | -                         | 33,243                           | -                              | 33,243                               |\n|                                | Customers' liability under acceptances       | 10,574               | 358                      | (116)                     | 10,816                           | -                              | 10,816                               |\n|                                | Other assets                                 | 20,661               | 465                      | 7,233                     | 28,359                           | 12,063                         | 40,422                               |\n|                                | Total credit exposures                       | $  792,214           | $  90,815                | $  10,965                 | $  893,994                       | $  81,725                      | $  975,719                           |\n| 2022                           | Total credit exposures                       | $  781,668           | $  86,056                | $  11,955                 | $  879,679                       | $  63,918                      | $  943,597                           |",

These SBUs are supported by Corporate and Other.\n\nCanadian Personal and Business Banking provides personal and business clients across Canada with financial advice, services and solutions through banking centres, as well as mobile and online channels, to help make their ambitions a reality.\n\nCanadian Commercial Banking and Wealth Management provides high-touch, relationship-oriented banking and wealth management services to middle-market companies, entrepreneurs, high-net-worth individuals and families across Canada, as well as asset management services to institutional investors.\n\nU.S. Commercial Banking and Wealth Management provides tailored, relationship-oriented banking and wealth management solutions  across the U.S., focusing on middle-market and mid-corporate companies, entrepreneurs, high-net-worth individuals and families, as well as operating personal and small business banking services in four U.S. markets.\n\nCapital Markets and Direct Financial Services provides integrated global markets products and services, investment banking and corporate banking solutions, and top-ranked research to our clients around the world, and leverages CIBC's digital capabilities to provide a cohesive set of direct banking, direct investing and innovative multi-currency payment solutions for CIBC's clients.\n\nCorporate and Other includes the following functional groups - Technology, Infrastructure and Innovation, Risk Management, People, Culture and Brand, Finance and Enterprise Strategy, as well as other support groups. The expenses of these functional and support groups are generally allocated to the business lines within the SBUs. Corporate and Other also includes the results of CIBC FirstCaribbean and other portfolio investments, as well as other income statement and balance sheet items not directly attributable to the business lines.\n\n## Business unit allocations\n\nRevenue, expenses, and other balance sheet resources related to certain activities are generally allocated to the lines of business within the SBUs. Treasury activities impact the financial results of the SBUs. Each line of business within our SBUs is charged or credited with a market-based cost of funds on assets and liabilities, respectively, which impacts the revenue performance of the SBUs. This market-based cost of funds takes into account the cost of maintaining sufficient regulatory capital to support business requirements, including the cost of preferred shares. Once the interest and liquidity risks inherent in our client-driven assets and liabilities are transfer priced into Treasury, they are managed within CIBC's risk framework and limits. Capital is attributed to the SBUs based on the estimated amount of regulatory capital required to support their businesses, which is intended to consistently measure and align the costs with the underlying benefits and risks associated with SBU activities. Earnings on unattributed capital remain in Corporate and Other.\n\nWe review our transfer pricing methodologies on an ongoing basis to ensure they reflect changing market environments and industry practices.\n\nWe use a Product Owner/Customer Segment/Distributor Channel allocation management model to measure and report the results of operations of various lines of business within our SBUs. The model uses certain estimates and methodologies to process internal transfers between the impacted lines of business for sales, renewals and trailer commissions as well as certain attributable costs. Periodically, the sales, renewals and trailer commission rates paid to customer segments for certain products/services are revised and applied prospectively.\n\nThe non-interest expenses of the functional and support groups are generally allocated to the business lines within the SBUs based on appropriate criteria and methodologies. The basis of allocation is reviewed periodically to reflect changes in support to business lines. Other costs not directly attributable to business lines remain in Corporate and Other.\n\nWe recognize provision for credit losses on both impaired (stage 3) and performing (stages 1 and 2) loans in the respective SBUs.",

In June 2020, the IASB issued amendments to IFRS 17 partly aimed at helping companies implement the standard. IFRS 17, incorporating the amendments, is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2023, which for us will be November 1, 2023. IFRS 17 provides comprehensive guidance on the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of insurance contracts we issue and reinsurance contracts we hold. IFRS 17 requires groups of insurance contracts to be established and measured on the basis of fulfilment cash flows using the measurement models outlined by the standard. Insurance contracts under the General Measurement Model (GMM) are measured based on the present value of fulfilment cash flows, a risk adjustment for non-financial risks, and a contractual service margin (CSM) representing our unearned profits on a portfolio basis, further disaggregated into profitability groups. We expect to apply GMM to our insurance contracts with contract boundaries exceeding a year. Contracts under the Premium Allocation Approach (PAA) are measured on the basis of premiums received and related cash flows. We expect to apply the PAA measurement model to our insurance contracts with contract boundaries shorter than a year. Under both measurement models, the liability for incurred claims is measured on the basis of fulfilment cash flows relating to claims incurred. Key differences between IFRS 4 and IFRS 17 which are applicable to CIBC include the following:\n\n- \u0081 Under IFRS 4, gains or losses from new business are recognized immediately. Under IFRS 17, gains from new business are deferred and recognized over time as insurance services are provided. If a group of contracts is expected to be onerous at initial recognition or turns onerous subsequently, the losses will be recognized immediately.\n- \u0081 Under IFRS 4, the discount rate used to measure the insurance contract liability is determined on the basis of the assets supporting the insurance liability. Under IFRS 17, the discount rate used to measure the insurance contracts issued and reinsurance held is based upon the characteristics of the insurance contract.\n\nWe expect to adopt IFRS 17 retrospectively for the fiscal year beginning November 1, 2023, with a restatement of the 2023 comparative period. The after-tax reduction to retained earnings is expected to be approximately $55 million at the beginning of the comparative year as of November 1, 2022.\n\n## International Tax Reform Pillar Two Model Rules - Amendments to IAS 12 'Income Taxes' (IAS 12)\n\nOn May 23, 2023, the IASB issued 'International Tax Reform - Pillar Two Model Rules', which amended IAS 12, to provide temporary relief from the accounting and disclosure for deferred taxes arising from the implementation of Pillar Two model rules published by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. The Pillar Two model rules provide a general framework for the implementation of a 15% global minimum tax, which is to be applied on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis. CIBC has retrospectively adopted this amendment and applied the exception to recognizing and disclosing deferred taxes related to Pillar Two income taxes. Further amendments require certain additional disclosures on Pillar Two income tax exposures as of CIBC's fiscal year beginning November 1, 2023.",
