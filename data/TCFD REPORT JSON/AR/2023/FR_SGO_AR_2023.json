These results - which have been achieved thanks to the hard work of all the Group's employees, to whom I would like to express my sincere gratitude - are proof that our strategy is the right one, against a backdrop of intense economic, environmental and political tensions worldwide.\n\nSaint-Gobain's sound financial situation is also a source of satisfaction for its shareholders. Among other things, it is the result of effective corporate governance. All Board members are fully committed to monitoring the implementation of the strategy defined by the Executive Committee and the progress made by the Group in all areas.\n\nIn 2024, Saint-Gobain will reach the final stage of the transition that I have led with the Board, culminating in Benoit Bazin's appointment as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. I must say how pleased I am to have supported Benoit on this journey.\n\nThe successful change in Group governance reflects a unique model and culture, that of a company founded almost four centuries ago, capable of renewing and reinventing itself, while always keeping in mind the interests of all its stakeholders.\n\nAfter having devoted almost 35 years of my life to Saint -Gobain, including the last 14 years as Chairman, I am stepping down with the greatest sense of confidence. I wish the Group every success, convinced of the strength of its strategy, the relevance of its positioning , and its ability with its fantastic corporate purpose - to meet the major environmental and social challenges of our contemporary world - climate change, resource scarcity and rapid urbanization.\n\nThe extraordinary diversity and expertise of our teams, our presence on every continent and our potential for innovation also constitute unique attributes that will make Saint-Gobain the undisputed leader in light and sustainable construction worldwide .",

Today, our market positioning is clear, robust and conducive to long-term growth for the Group and its stakeholders. Our solutions for energy renovation, new lightweight construction and the decarbonization of construction and industry are, and will be for a long time to come, vital tools to meet the environmental and social challenges facing our societies.\n\nIn a difficult market environment, the Group successfully stayed on course , deploying our 'Grow & Impact' plan for the third year running. Our excellent results in 2023 , both financial (notably with a new record margin and cash-flow) and non -financial (from the decarbonization of our products and processes to the benefits our solutions bring to our customers' well-being and to the environment), are proof of the relevance and power of our approach. They are also the result of the bold strategic decisions made decisively, over the last few years, through a rapid change in business portfolio and geographical footprint, to seek further growth in North America, Asia and emerging countries. Our country-based business model, the mobilization of all our teams on every continent, and the quality and speed of execution they demonstrate on a daily basis, are all assets that have made this performance possible.\n\nTo continue the deployment of this winning strategy , and against a backdrop of changes in the Group's governance this year, I am grateful to the Board of Directors for the confidence it has shown in me. I would especially like to thank Pierre-Andr\u00e9 de Chalendar for the full support he has given me throughout the years we have worked together for Saint-Gobain, so that I am fully prepared to succeed him as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.\n\nTransforming the building and construction sector is an absolute must if we are to meet the considerable challenges of climate change, depletion of natural resources, as well as the accelerated pace of urbanization, driven by strong population growth, which requires access to decent housing and well-being for all. More than ever, we are determined to play our leading role, aiming ever higher, so as to make the world a better home.\n\nMessage of the Chief Executive Officer\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur market positioning is clear, robust and conducive to long-term growth.

They are a condition of belonging to Saint -Gobain.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 5 principles of conduct\n\nThese principles of conduct are the fundamental values that unite managers and employees.\n\n- Professional commitment\n- Respect for others\n- Integrity\n- Loyalty\n- Solidarity\n\nPresentation of the Group\n\nSaint -Gobain has been signed up to the United Nations Global Compact since 2003. This demonstrates the Group's drive for Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR), which includes regular communication of its progress in areas covered by the Global Compact.\n\n- The implementation of the Principles of Conduct and Action is reflected in policies and commitments applied by all of its entities in all countries in which they operate. Foremost among these commitments are the 'reference policies'. These define the management principles applicable to all Saint -Gobain entities and employees, as well as to subcontractors in their work for the Group, and suppliers under the Responsible Purchasing policy (see in the URD,  3.2.1.A, p. 95).\n- This desire to establish the Principles of Conduct and Action as a sign of belonging is illustrated by the objective set by the Group's Board of Directors to train all managers on the Principles in their first year with the Group. In addition, the Principles of Conduct and Action are included in the welcome booklets for all Saint -Gobain employees and in most employment contracts (see section 1.5.3, p. 60).\n- The Principles of Conduct and Action refer explicitly to the applicable conventions of the International Labor Organization (ILO), the International Charter on Human Rights, the guidelines for multinational enterprises of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), and the OECD's convention on the fight against corruption.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThese principles guide the actions of all management and employees in their performance of their duties.\n\n- Respect for the law\n- Caring for the environment\n- Respect for health and safety at work\n- Respect for employee rights\n\n<!-- image -->",

MAJOR MILESTONES IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE GROUP\n\n## 1665\n\n## Saint -Gobain was founded in 1665\n\nby Louis XIV, under the name of the 'Royal Manufacture of Mirrors', in order to put an end to the technological and commercial supremacy of the Republic of Venice in the manufacturing of mirrors (1) .\n\n## 19th century\n\nThroughout the 19th century, Compagnie de Saint -Gobain, which became a limited company in 1830, diversified its activities\n\ninto sectors such as chemicals, glass products and the automotive industry. It quickly expanded into international markets, establishing itself in the United States in 1829, Germany in 1858, Italy in 1888 and Spain in 1905.\n\n## 1970\n\n## The Group, which successfully\n\n## overcame the major crises\n\nof the century and invested heavily in research and development, withdrew from its chemical activities and merged with Pont-\u00e0-Mousson, created in 1856 and specializing in cast iron pipes.\n\n## 1986\n\n## The privatization of Saint -Gobain\n\n- which had been nationalized in 1982 - was a huge popular success: 1,500,000 shareholders subscribed.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 1990\n\n## Through the acquisition of Norton ,\n\nthe Group doubled its presence in the United States, which opened up new markets and enabled it to develop its know-how in the areas of abrasives, plastics and ceramics.\n\n## 1996\n\n## The acquisition of Poliet\n\nprovided the basis for developing the distribution business lines. Saint -Gobain then continued its acquisitions in the world of construction material trading.\n\n## 2005\n\n## The acquisition in 2005 of British\n\nPlaster Board , the world leader in plasterboard, was the Group's largest ever.

OUR INTEGRATED APPROACH: CREATING SHARED VALUE WITH ALL OF THE GROUP'S STAKEHOLDERS\n\n\\_\\_\n\nFor Saint-Gobain, sustainable growth is inconceivable without taking into account the interests of all its stakeholders. It is therefore a question of pursuing a development trajectory that integrates both the financial performance and shareholder value objective as well as the Group's Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR).\n\n## CSR, a cross-functional priority\n\nSaint-Gobain has placed CSR at the very heart of its strategy, so that it feeds into all discussions, analyses and decisions, and it is rooted in the daily lives of all employees. This focus has accelerated further since the end of 2021 with the launch of the 'Grow and Impact' strategic plan, aligned with Saint -Gobain's corporate purpose Making the world a better home - and its vision - to be the worldwide leader in sustainable construction.\n\nThe Group's CSR approach involves a twofold commitment: maximizing the positive contribution to environmental issues (specifically climate, social and societal issues), and minimizing the impact on human beings and the environment (see chapter 3, p. 92). This approach requires Saint-Gobain to collaborate with all players in its ecosystem. It also involves measuring and transparently communicating its objectives and the results obtained, through a whole series of key performance indicators (see in the URD, section 4.2, p. 152).\n\nThe word 'cross-functional' reflects the universal scope of the notion of CSR, which gives meaning to, but also influences all actions within the Group. This obviously concerns industrial processes and the solutions developed by Saint-Gobain, but also the HR policy, the care of employees and their families, diversity and the attractiveness of the Saint-Gobain brand as an employer, relations with suppliers,",

Beyond direct relations with its customers and suppliers, the aim is to bring all its stakeholders on board. It is this approach in particular that leads the Group to collaborate with NGOs, with semi-public organizations such as EFRAG, and with partners such as WBCSD. Saint-Gobain\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nis also committed to accelerate the spread of sustainable construction, notably through discussion and an exchange of ideas, thanks to the Sustainable Construction Observatory, witch publishes the  \"Constructing a Sustainable Future\" online magazine (www.constructingsustainable-future.com) and organizes regular international meetings around major multilateral events.\n\n## Pursuing the objective of financial performance and shareholder value, allocating the capital efficiently\n\nTrue to its approach in favor of sustainable and profitable development, Saint -Gobain has set itself, as part of its 'Grow & Impact' strategic plan, the goal of accelerating its growth, financial performance and value creation for its shareholders. In particular, the Group has set annual average financial targets for the period 2021-2025, with organic sales growth of between 3% and 5%, an operating margin of between 9% and 11%, and an attractive shareholder return policy. In terms of investments, Saint-Gobain is continuing its policy of strengthening its industrial capacity in countries where market growth is strongest. This amounted to over \u20ac2 billion in 2023 in total, with around 70% of growth capex invested in North America, Asia and emerging countries. To achieve its long-term goals, and in particular to meet its commitment to work towards carbon neutrality by 2050, the Group also invests through a capital investment budget over several years to support the reduction of its CO 2 footprint.\n\n## A strategic approach aligned with Saint-Gobain's vision and its corporate purpose\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Vision\n\nBe the worldwide leader in light and sustainable construction\n\n## Strategic plan\n\nGrow and Impact",

FEEDBACK ON THE YEAR 2023\n\n\\_\\_\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn 2023, Saint-Gobain has continued, in a determined manner, the implementation of its\"Grow & Impact\" strategic plan. The markets in which the Group operates are conducive to growth on the long term (see section 1.4.6, pp. 42-45). In a difficult macroeconomic environment with lower volumes, the Group has outperformed its markets and delivered yet again a very robust performance. Saint-Gobain is now firmly set on a financial trajectory that has seen an acceleration in growth of its results, cash flow and value creation. This translates notably into strong organic growth (6.4% per annum on average); the creation of a world leader in construction chemicals, with annual sales of \u20ac5.7 billion (pro forma for recent acquisitions and divestments); a pro forma operating income well-balanced between the three geographic zones (32% in North America, 31% in Asia and emerging countries and 37% in Western Europe); a record profitability and value creation; and a recordhigh shareholder return: \u20ac4.1 billion returned to shareholders over a three-year period.\n\nTogether with these superb financial results, Saint-Gobain accelerates on the non-financial performance. The Group's range of solutions aims at maximizing the positive impact for its customers, including low-carbon solutions (glass and plasterboard for example), solutions for the circular economy (notably with plasterboards made with over 50% recycled plaster) and solutions reducing carbon emissions for our customers (for instance admixtures allowing a 50% reduction in CO 2 emissions from concrete).\n\nSaint-Gobain is also making rapid progress in minimizing its environmental footprint, notably thanks to several innovations in its production processes, such as the world's first-ever 100% electric production of plasterboard; the world's first-ever test production of glass in a furnace powered by over 30% hydrogen; the very-low-carbon production of siding, plasterboard and acoustic ceilings.\n\nIn 2023, Saint-Gobain invested \u20ac223 million in capital expenditure and research & development for decarbonization. Its investment decisions are underpinned by the internal carbon prices (in force since 2016). Thanks to these efforts, the Group was able to reduce its scope 1 and 2 CO 2 emissions by 34% (to 8.8 million tonnes) and together with the growth in its earnings, carbon intensity per euro of sales and EBITDA fell by 44% and 56%, respectively, in 2023 versus 2017. Saint-Gobain has also increased the proportion of carbon-free electricity that it uses, which reached 57% of its consumption in 2023.\n\nLastly, stakeholder engagement at Saint-Gobain increased once again in 2023: the Group employees' engagement rate has reached 83% and their feeling of belonging has reached 89%. Saint-Gobain also supported around 100,000 trade professionals in France in 2023 in the area of training and certification. As the global industry leader, the Group has launched in 2023 the Sustainable Construction Observatory.\n\nSaint-Gobain demonstrates its resilience, thanks to the remarkable agility and the unwavering commitment of its teams, its proximity to customers and its unique range of comprehensive and innovative solutions.",

SIGNIFICANT EVENTS DURING THE YEAR\n\n\\_\\_\n\n## Creating a diverse and inclusive work environment, developing human capital\n\nJanuary 4 Saint-Gobain was certified 'Top Employer Global' for the 8th consecutive year.\n\nOnly 15 companies in the world have received this label, which rewards all the Group's actions and commitments worldwide towards becoming a company where it is good to work, where each person's talent is valued and where the teams are engaged. Now that Peru and Singapore have entered the rankings, 40 countries in which the Saint-Gobain Group is established have this year received the Top Employer label.\n\nJanuary 4 For the fifth consecutive time, Saint-Gobain was included in the Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index (GEI), which this year contains 484 companies representing 45 countries. This index measures companies' performance in terms of gender equality. This recognition reflects the Group's commitment and is an acknowledgment of all the work that has been done.\n\n## Investing for the environmental transition\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMarch 4 Saint-Gobain became the first manufacturer to achieve flat glass production with more than 30% hydrogen during tests at the Herzogenrath site in Germany. This world first proves the technical feasibility of the process, which will reduce the site's direct CO 2 emissions by up to 70% (scope 1).\n\nApril 4 Saint-Gobain announced the start of 100% decarbonized production of plasterboard at its plant in Fredrikstad, Norway. The manufacturing process was decarbonized by switching from natural gas to electricity from hydroelectric sources, thus avoiding 23,000 metric tons of CO 2 emissions per year.\n\nThanks to plant modernization and improvements in heat recovery and process efficiency, the energy consumption of the site has also been reduced by 30%. The work carried out also increased the plant's production capacity by 40%, strengthening the Group's leading position in lightweight construction in Norway, while responding to a strong demand for sustainable solutions to reduce the carbon footprint of buildings.\n\nMay 4 Saint-Gobain signed a renewable electricity purchase agreement (PPA) in India with Vibrant Energy to supply wind and solar power to six Saint -Gobain sites. This 20-year agreement enters into force in 2024 and will increase the Group's proportion of renewable electricity in India to 65% from 2025.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nNovember 4 Saint-Gobain signed a 14-year PPA with Alpiq Energie France. This agreement will provide more than 500 GWh of solar electricity to Saint-Gobain for the duration of the PPA; 11 French plants in Saint-Gobain will thus be 100% supplied with solar electricity.\n\nDecember 4 Saint-Gobain signed a PPA with CVE, an independent French producer of renewable energy, guaranteeing access to approximately 140 GWh of solar electricity in South Africa, over a period of 20 years.\n\nThis PPA is expected to cover approximately 40% of the electricity needs of the four main industrial sites of Saint -Gobain in the country, which manufacture plasterboards and mortars.\n\nSeptember 4 Saint-Gobain signed a 15-year PPA with Total Energies. The agreement covers the purchase of solar energy for 125 industrial sites in North America (United States and Canada). It is a 100 MW PPA and is expected to reduce Saint-Gobain's electricity-related CO 2 emissions (Scope 2 emissions) to 90,000 metric tons per year in North America.",

In this context, the Group presented the results of the first International Barometer of Sustainable Construction, a study carried out by the CSA Institute among professionals in the sector, elected representatives, associations and students.\n\nJune 4 Saint-Gobain became an 'Official Supporter' of the Paris 2024 Olympic and Paralympic Games. The Group makes its expertise in sustainable construction available to athletes and spectators.\n\n## Investing in production equipment\n\nMarch 4 Saint-Gobain Rigips and Dalsan Al\u00e7i merged their activities in Turkey to create a leader in plaster and plasterboards. In 2023, following completion of the industrial investment in the new Turgutlu factory (near Izmir), the merged entity will benefit from an annual production capacity of 100 million square meters for plasterboard, two million metric tons for plaster and 50 million meters for metal profiles.\n\nJuly 4 Saint-Gobain announced its intention to invest nearly \u20ac215 million over the next two years to expand and modernize its CertainTeed gypsum plant in Palatka, Florida, which will double the production capacity of the existing plant and improve its energy consumption. This new production line, which will start in the second half of 2025, will benefit from state-of-the-art automation equipment and technologies to reduce energy consumption.\n\nThe projects involving the Saint -Gobain Group in Paris and in the host cities elsewhere in France demonstrate its capacity for innovation in order to offer tailor-made solutions and meet the environmental objectives of the organizers.\n\nNovember 4 The Group presented Team Saint-Gobain, a collective of seven athletes involved in different Olympic and Paralympic disciplines and sponsored by Luc Abalo, three-time Olympic handball champion. This support is representative of the Group's values and the message it conveys: 'Aim higher to live better in the world' .\n\n## Financial information\n\nJanuary 4 Saint-Gobain successfully launched a \u20ac1.15 billion bond issue in two tranches: \u20ac500 million over 18 months and \u20ac650 million over six years. With this transaction, the Group is taking advantage of favorable market conditions to anticipate the refinancing of its debt maturities while optimizing its financing conditions. The issue was more than 2.5 times over-subscribed, with nearly 200 investors expressing their confidence in Saint-Gobain's credit quality. The Group's long-term debt issues is rated BBB (positive outlook) by Standard & Poor's and Baa1 (stable outlook) by Moody's.\n\nSeptember 4 Saint-Gobain joined the Euro Stoxx 50, the benchmark stock market index for Eurozone markets which reflects the performance of the largest listed companies in the Eurozone based on market capitalization.\n\nJune 4 Saint-Gobain announced that it expects a double-digit operating margin for the first half of 2023. The Group maintained its highly satisfactory operating performance, despite a mixed economic environment. Saint -Gobain confirmed that it is targeting an operating margin of between 9% and 11% in 2023, in line with the objective of the 'Grow & Impact' strategic plan.\n\nJune 4 The Combined General Shareholders' Meeting of Compagnie de Saint-Gobain approved the distribution of a dividend up by 23% to \u20ac2 per share. The Meeting also renewed the term of office of Mrs. Dominique Leroy, independent director, and appointed Mrs. Jana Revedin as a new independent director.\n\nThis inclusion is a recognition of the Group's profound transformation and its excellent results in terms of growth and profitability, and especially earnings per share, free cash flow generation and return on capital employed.\n\nOctober 4 Saint-Gobain announced that it had canceled 7,577,049 treasury shares purchased on the market.\n\nWith over \u20ac1.5 billion in shares bought back since 2021, the Group is ahead of its \u20ac2 billion buyback target over five years (2021-2025).\n\nNovember 4 Saint-Gobain successfully launched a \u20ac2 billion bond issue in two tranches: \u20ac1 billion over three years, and \u20ac1 billion over seven years.",

The frequency and intensity of extreme weather events show that the climate change now taking place will drastically affect all parts of the planet. The acceleration of this trend requires us to decarbonize the economy at a sustained pace , throughout the world, not in a marginal way, but taking into account how our societies and lifestyles function as a whole. Current average global temperatures over ten years call into question (1) our collective ability to achieve the target set in 2015 to limit this warming to 1.5\u00b0C (2) .\n\nIn this context, with global CO 2 emissions linked to the production and consumption of fossil fuels continuing to increase (+1.1%) in 2023 compared to 2022, efforts to decarbonize must be stepped up in all countries and economic sectors .\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAmong the latter, construction is one of the most relevant, since buildings account for nearly 37% of annual CO 2 emissions worldwide (3) , two-thirds of which are linked to the operation of buildings and one-third to the production and transport of materials and to construction machinery. However, technologies exist to transform this sector , both through innovative methods, solutions and materials for new construction - in particular through so-called lightweight construction - and through the renovation of individual and collective buildings, nearly half of which will still exist and continue to emit carbon in 2050. European countries especially are at the forefront on this objective (see section 1.4.6.A, p. 42-43).\n\nAll segments of industry are impacted by this need to decarbonize quickly, not only the expanding mobility markets - primarily electric vehicles and air transport - but also the heavy and greenhouse gas-emitting industries , including the glass industry.\n\nThe solution to climate change necessarily involves the general public, governments and businesses, all of which have a key role to play. For its part, Saint -Gobain has committed to achieve net zero emissions (scopes 1, 2 and 3) by 2050. By 2030, the Group has set intermediate reduction targets (in absolute value compared to 2017) of 33% for scopes 1 and 2 and 16% for scope 3 (see section 1.5.1, p . 52) To achieve these objectives, it is determined to reduce the impact of its own operations, in particular by constantly improving the efficiency of its processes.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- (2) Compared to the pre-industrial era.",

        "page_content": "Thanks to its offering and its unique position in the construction value chain, Saint -Gobain is a strategic answer to the decarbonization challenge on a global scale by offering its customers solutions and tools that actively contribute to this objective. In the trading of building materials for example, the SaintGobain Distribution B\u00e2timent France brands will offer professional customers carbon information on 140,000 items in their catalog (4) .\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## SHARE OF BUILDINGS\n\n(construction and use) in final energy consumption worldwide*\n\n* IEA, 2020 (2019 figures).\n\n## B. SCARCITY OF RESOURCES\n\n\\_\\_\n\nThe building sector is among the most implicated in this area, too. In terms of water, it alone accounts for 15% of the consumption of drinking water, which itself represents just 2.5% of the total water on the surface of the planet (5) . In this example, this already critical situation will worsen under the effect of other megatrends such as climate change and population growth; by 2030, the volume of water needed to meet the needs of the world's population will have to increase by 40%.\n\nThe aim is therefore to steadily reduce the impact of the construction sector and the industry sector, through a reduction in resource extraction . The goal is to accelerate the transition to a circular economy , taking into account the entire life cycle of the products marketed by the companies, in order to limit their consumption of natural resources, extend their lifespan\n\n(\n\n4)\n\n(5)\n\nAt the end of 2023.\n\nand encourage their recycling. Saint -Gobain meets this challenge using its construction and industry solutions. In 2022, the Group was the first industrial manufacturer to produce and market a plasterboard designed with more than 50% recycled plaster.\n\nIt is also committed to improving its own industrial processes . Non-recovered waste fell by 46% (corresponding to 0.329 million metric tons) and industrial water withdrawals were reduced by 24% (corresponding to 42.7 million cubic meters), in absolute value, between 2017 and 2023.\n\nThe Group's activities in trading of building materials, through their territorial coverage, play an important role in advancing towards a circular economy; Saint -Gobain Distribution B\u00e2timent France has thus become one of the first private networks of waste collection points for construction sites.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## C. DEMOGRAPHICS AND URBANIZATION\n\n\\_\\_\n\nThe population continues to grow globally , increasingly tending to concentrate in and around cities , which already account for most of the energy and natural resources consumed. This has resulted in increasing demand for housing that is healthy and accessible to all .\n\nThe construction and mobility sectors are directly affected by these megatrends; there is a need to build faster,\n\ncheaper, in a more sustainable manner, more efficiently , and to bring comfort; to renovate a significant proportion of existing buildings and to promote modes of transport with less impact on GHG emissions and the extraction of natural resources .\n\nThe Group's environment\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nUrbanization is leading to an increased need to build collective use areas , from offices to hospitals, including places dedicated to sport, commerce or entertainment. Generally speaking, the aim is to transform buildings to achieve low energy consumption and to prepare urban areas for adaptation to climate change , by designing and building resilient cities that can be adapted over the long term.\n\nSaint-Gobain plays a central role in responding to the needs of affordable and sustainable construction , so that everyone can benefit from decent and energy-efficient housing . The Group contributes to improving urban life through all its solutions for renovation , new construction and infrastructure related to the water supply. Saint-Gobain is also participating in the development of new, smarter and more sustainable mobility solutions.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## NUMBER OF HUMANS\n\nliving in countries with high water stress*\n\n- * World Health Organization, data 2021.",

The aim is to mobilize our teams in order to implement our vision: be the worldwide leader in light and sustainable construction, which improves everyone's daily life with our high-performance solutions. To do this, Saint-Gobain is implementing a unique model (see section 1.2.3, pp. 26-27) which aims to outperform all the markets in which it operates as well as providing its customers with sustainable and efficient solutions. The objective is therefore to pursue a development trajectory that integrates both the financial performance and shareholder value objectives as well as corporate social responsibility.\n\nAs part of the Grow & Impact plan, the quest for outperformance is expressed in financial targets for the period 2021-2025 concerning organic growth (between +3% and +5%), the operating margin (between +9% and +11%) and an attractive shareholder return policy. To achieve these objectives, the reorganization of the Group - to encourage decision-making at the local level and increase the responsibility of the Chief Executive Officers at individual country level - has already been instrumental in the performance delivered since the Grow & Impact plan was first implemented,\n\nwith a double-digit operating margin in 2023 (11.0%) as well as in 2022 and 2021.\n\nHowever, alongside the priority given to the local level there is the other aspect of our unique positioning: Saint-Gobain's global presence , which allows the Group to mobilize central resources and shared service centers in order to support the deployment of local offers, boosat innovation and promote the exchange of best practices. Furthermore,\n\nthe rebalancing of the Group's geographical presence on a global scale is a key factor in resilience; in 2023, North America, Asia and emerging countries accounted for 63% of Saint-Gobain's operating income, compared with 42% before the Group's transformation.\n\nIt also means, for Saint-Gobain, always striving to outperform its competitors through dynamic management of its business portfolio , a business approach which aims at excellence , and engaged discourse, mobilizing its stakeholders throughout the value chain.\n\nIt is by using these levers, but also by continuing its efforts on the use of data (see section 1.4.2, p. 38) and innovation (see section 1.4.3, p. 39), building a culture of trust and responsibility within an inclusive framework (see section 1.4.4, p. 40) and optimizing the allocation of financial resources (see section 1.4.5, p. 41) that\n\nOur strategy\n\nIn Europe , the decarbonization objective and increasingly restrictive regulation favor the renovation market; in the Americas and in the emerging countries , residential construction benefits from a demand for new housing that shows no sign of weakening; and finally, the need to decarbonize industry supports market demand in heavy industry and mobility as well as the construction industry. Despite a difficult geopolitical environment and an inflationary context, these major trends (see section 1.3.1, pp. 32-33) create a long-term growth prospect for Saint-Gobain.\n\nIn terms of sustainability, Saint -Gobain's strategy consists of maximizing the positive impact of its offer - with nearly 75% of sales addressing sustainable development issues, as defined in the \"Solutions for Growth\" program - while minimizing its environmental footprint, in particular with several pioneering technologies developed in 2022 and 2023, such as the zero-carbon production of glazing and plasterboard (scope 1 and 2). In 2023, Saint-Gobain cut its CO 2 emissions by 34% in relation to 2017 levels. This represents a 44% reduction in the carbon intensity of its sales.\n\nThe Group is determined to contribute positively, in the long term, to a decarbonized world (see section 1.5.1, p. 52), to a more circular economy (see section 1.5.2, p. 56) and to a better world for all (see section 1.5.3, p. 60).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nof the Group's growth capex is invested in North America, Asia and emerging countries\n\nSaint -Gobain continues to grow and exploit all the opportunities offered by its markets (see section 1.4.6, pp. 42-45).\n\n<!-- image -->",

The key to success lies in taking into account all facets of the Group's operations , from production to the supply chain, including finance, customer engagement, employee experience and exchanges with all our stakeholders. From this point of view, the Group's global presence, the diversity of its teams and activities, and the complexity of its value chains represent both a challenge and an opportunity to be exploited.\n\nEssential to innovation, data itself has become central to our model .

Another step towards a circular economy.\n\nSaint-Gobain is evolving in a rapidly changing world, with the continued expansion of digital technologies, the emergence of new consumer expectations, and the global megatrends of climate change, the scarcity of natural resources as well as urbanization and population growth (see section 1.3.1, pp. 32-33). The pace of change is accelerating, which is why, far beyond R&D alone, Saint -Gobain has put innovation at the heart of its strategy and its approach to customer relations, turning it into a growth driver. Many products are developed jointly with clients to cater to their specific needs, for example in plastics, construction chemicals, and high performance refractory products for the metalworking and glass manufacturing industries. In 2023, more than 450 patents were filed by the Group, which has nearly 3,700 researchers, 100 research and development centers, topic-based R&D networks and nearly 3,600 marketing experts worldwide. Saint-Gobain works both on disruptive innovation and on the incremental improvement of its products, processes and services.\n\nSince the Grow & Impact plan was first implemented, the innovation policy has been restructured around four priorities: processes and solutions for a transition to carbon neutrality ; solutions to reduce the use of natural resources ; materials and solutions to develop new markets ; and lightweight construction systems which improve the performance of businesses in the building sector and increase user comfort.\n\nInnovation, though, is essentially a non-linear process, requiring a conducive environment in order to develop. So beyond this structured approach, Saint-Gobain also needs to encourage the dissemination of a culture of innovation, and therefore an appropriate mindset across all teams . Being curious, open to learning and sharing, but also empathetic and customer-focused, showing humility while understanding uncertainty: these are all traits that the Group wants to encourage. Among the measures implemented to achieve this, the 'Innovation Catalysts' program, launched in 2021, aims to train employees representing multiple functions (R&D, marketing, HR, strategy, etc.) and volunteers in order to unlock the innovation potential of their activities. It is the whole organization that needs to adapt in order to further promote creativity and agile project management methods, allow space for divergent thinking, encourage questioning of the status quo and tolerate failure. This also implies an accurate knowledge of the existing and future needs of customers , which is acquired in particular through an open approach to innovation based on open and crossfunctional methods.\n\nFor years without interruption, the Group has been developing multiple types of collaboration , such as partnerships with academic institutions or co-development initiatives and financial investments in start-ups , through Nova, a structure created in 2006. The main objective is to better understand the specific expectations of clients in each of the Group's markets, in order to identify use cases and situations where Saint -Gobain will bring value, reduce time to market and optimize return on investment. This applies to all types of clients, from architects and engineers to developers, including craftsmen, building contractors and of course building owners and occupants. This approach applies to all of the Group's markets and activities; it concerns not only industrial processes and product design, but also associated services, digital tools and business models.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTo meet the specific requirements of the Alto Pont-Rouge project in Geneva (Switzerland), SageGlass and Vetrotech combined their expertise in solar protection and fire protection.

For the Group, this means having the best teams, in a diverse and inclusive work environment that is both demanding and caring , as an essential condition for the success of its strategy.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nNaturally, therefore, the human component is an integral part of the Grow & Impact plan. It all starts, of course, with a race to the top in recruitment and continues with a focus on developing individuals , with increased attentiveness and more personalized follow-up. Each year, the 'me@Saint-Gobain' survey measures employee satisfaction; in 2023, it recorded an engagement rate of 83%. In addition, Saint -Gobain recorded continuous growth in its net promoter score (1) (from 22 to 85 between 2019 and 2023). For the 8th year running, the Group has received 'Top Employer Global' certification, proof of the sustained excellence of our practices in the field of human resources and in the management of the women and men who bring Saint-Gobain to life on a daily basis.\n\n## The quality of the teams\n\nand that of the work environment are essential for talent retention and for the attractiveness of the Group, which continues to strive resolutely for greater diversity (see section 3.5.3 of the URD, p. 134). This is particularly true in the area of gender diversity, with 28% of managers at Group level being women, approaching the target of 30% by 2025. Developing talent also requires a sustained training effort, supported worldwide by Saint -Gobain University, but also by a focus on employee mobility.\n\nThe evolution of the Saint-Gobain model, the deployment of its decentralized organization, the crucial nature of the innovation approach, its ambition to achieve high performance and its determination to create an exciting and inclusive work environment are all elements that require a work culture based on trust, responsibility and collaboration .\n\nThis approach, called TEC (Trust, Empowerment, Collaboration) is the key\n\nto our success: without trust there is no accountability; without empowerment there is no audacity to imagine, create and innovate; without collaboration there is no sharing, no intelligence and no performance .\n\nTEC aims to create the conditions for enhanced mobilization, sincere goodwill and a sense of unity.

On this last point, renovation represents a crucial lever as energy prices trend upwards, in both the short and long term, with consequences for energy independence but also for the social sustainability of the energy costs. In France, for example, the residential energy renovation market is growing one to two points faster than the overall renovation market.\n\nIn the context of climate change, the renovation of buildings allows both the reduction of GHG emissions, but also the adaptation of individual and collective buildings to the consequences of climate change and specifically the increasing number of heat waves. Finally, inadequate housing has particularly serious health consequences, which can however be reduced by investing heavily in improving the living conditions of residents through renovation.\n\nANNUAL ENERGY SAVINGS\n\nexpected from EU Member States following the adoption of the Energy Efficiency Directive\n\n\u00cb\n\nIn the current context, new construction markets have been affected by a cyclical slowdown characterized by an inflationary environment and rising interest rates.

It requires that the majority of these economies be made in the most energy-intensive buildings. member states will also need to ensure that at least 16% of the worst performing non-residential buildings are renovated by 2030, and 26% by 2033. The final stages of the legislative process in this area should be reached in 2024.\n\nThis text is another element in the European regulatory and tax structure relating to energy renovation . This structure already consists of several elements, including the Energy Efficiency Directive (EED), which imposes the 'energy efficiency first' principle and obliges member states to expect energy savings of 1.5% per year and to renovate a quarter of public buildings before 2030.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAnother example is the so-called 'ETS2' scheme, which extends the principle of emissions trading (ETS) to the building sector.\n\nAlongside the regulatory aspect, there are initiatives around renovation financing, including the additional effort made by the Union under its NGEU (Next Generation EU) program to help certain Member States make investments to help the environment.\n\nAs well as the general commitments set out in the 'Renovation Waves', member states are spending large and increasing amounts of money on financing residential energy renovations. In France, the 'MaPrimeRenov'' scheme is benefiting from an increase, with an estimated government budget of \u20ac4 billion, and it will focus more on global renovations. In Belgium, in the Wallonia region, subsidies for insulation work were increased in 2023, while in Poland, a significant proportion of the funds - in the order of several billion euros - allocated by the European Union will be devoted to energy renovation..\n\nIn addition to the financial aspect, the States use the regulatory lever : in Belgium, in the Flanders region, energy renovation to achieve a minimum energy rating of 'D' is mandatory within five years following the purchase of a property; in France, it is now\n\nOur strategy\n\nprohibited to place the most poorly insulated housing on the rental market; in Spain, energy saving certificates were adopted in 2023.\n\nNote that these structuring initiatives concern not only residential buildings, but also service-sector buildings and public buildings : in Greece, the 'Electra' program provides for \u20ac640 million over the period 2022-2026 to renovate 2.5 million m 2 in public buildings and reduce energy consumption by at least 30%; in France, large service-sector buildings must reduce their energy consumption by 40% by 2030, and a school renovation plan has been announced, with a funding envelope, with the target of renovating 40,000 schools by the end of 2034. In Germany, the 'Climate Action Program' was adopted in 2023 to accelerate the modernization of public buildings; in the Netherlands, legislation imposes the requirement to achieve a C rating in offices since January 2023.

NEW CONSTRUCTION\n\n\\_\\_\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThis market's long-term growth is driven by population growth, the housing shortage and the demand for environmentally-friendly new construction\n\nAt the European level, the construction sector is experiencing a cyclical slowdown. The volume of new residential construction in Europe for 2023 is estimated at nearly \u20ac400 billion (2) . In Europe and North America, a slowdown is taking place in new residential construction against the background of a sharp rise in real estate interest rates, following the accelerated monetary tightening of central banks since the beginning of 2022; in Europe, key interest rates increased by around 4.5 points in the space of 18 months. At the same time, households experienced losses in purchasing power linked to the rapid rise in inflation, which also affected their creditworthiness for estate projects.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nESTIMATED VOLUME\n\nof the new residential construction market in Europe by 2023\n\n\u00cb\n\nThe fall in building permits and building starts has been seen in most countries year-on-year, but there have nevertheless been clear differences between countries due to specific national factors: for example the slowdown is less pronounced in Southern Europe than in Northern Europe, due to slower and sometimes smaller increases in real estate interest rates, a more moderate fall in household purchasing power, and less pronounced real estate cycles in the years preceding the slowdown. The slowdown also differs in terms of its duration: in the United States, for example, building starts have stabilized since spring 2023, while the declines remain more pronounced in some European countries. Note that the differing real estate cycles in the 75 countries where the Group operates are a source of resilience for the Group.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nNevertheless, several factors could cause residential building permits to pick up again in 2024\n\nin developed countries. First of all, real estate interest rates are expected to stabilize or even fall during the year, as central banks are expected to lower their key rates in 2024. Household purchasing power is also expected to recover in 2024 thanks to the anticipated fall in inflation and rising wages; finally,\n\nthe adjustment of real estate prices could ease the recovery of real estate purchasing power.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nHOUSING SHORTAGE IN INDIA\n\nIn the long term, the growth of the new construction market is driven by unavoidable trends such as the housing shortage which is already a feature of developed countries (the United States is nearly four million homes short) as well as the growing need for residential buildings in emerging countries (there is a deficit of 19 million homes in India), due to continued population growth and urbanization. To meet these two essential needs, it is not just any new construction that is desirable, but environmentallyfriendly new construction. This translates into requirements in terms of GHG emissions , the use of natural resources (reducing extraction through efforts to promote circularity), the speed of execution or even the long-term adaptability of the buildings constructed. This growth prospect therefore primarily concerns lightweight construction techniques using decarbonized materials . This market is already growing by three to five points faster than traditional construction (3) .",

The impacts of the solutions are assessed across the entire value chain and for the main stakeholders involved, right through to the end user.\n\nThe criteria used to measure the benefits related to sustainable development focus on environmental, health, and wellbeing impacts. The measurement of the performance of solutions focuses on the increase in economic value for the client (productivity or other financial benefits) and the user experience.\n\nIn order to standardize the measurement of impacts and to accelerate differentiation in its markets, use cases have been selected to illustrate the value provided by Saint -Gobain solutions. They concern the decarbonization of industry through the solutions of the HPS (1) , renovation and new construction Business Units. For each use case, local teams identify solutions combining products and services offered by the brands and distribution networks. The tools developed enable them to measure the benefits and thus to adapt the offer and the sales pitch to the expectations of the stakeholders.\n\nThis program covers more than 90% of Saint -Gobain's sales and helps to orient Saint -Gobain's offer towards sustainable construction markets. The methodology used to identify sustainable solutions is available on the Group's website and has been reviewed by an independent third party.\n\nThe criteria used to measure environmental benefits are:\n\n- energy efficiency and its carbon impact;\n- optimization of natural resources, including water resources;\n\n\u00cb\n\n- all products and services that support the environmental efficiency of other industries.\n- The criteria used to evaluate the benefits in terms of health, comfort and well-being are:\n- safety and security, including the reduction of occupational risks in the value chain;\n- ergonomics;\n- indoor air quality;\n- acoustic comfort;\n- thermal comfort;\n- visual comfort.\n\nSaint -Gobain's sustainable solutions revenue notably includes activities not assessed in the context of compliance with the European regulation 2020/852 Taxonomy Regulation (see section 9.3.5, p. 424), such as distribution activities. It also includes the impacts and benefits of Group activities not yet covered by regulations, such as resources and the circular economy, as well as health, safety and comfort benefits. These activities, impacts and benefits are potentially eligible for the social taxonomy.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- * Solutions for Growth, methodology available on the Saint-Gobain website.",

The implementation and results of this strategy are integrated into scenarios that limit global warming to below a 1.5\u00b0C rise versus the pre-industrial era, so that they are aligned with the Paris Agreement.\n\nThe action plan for reducing carbon emissions (scopes 1, 2 and 3) is divided into two periods:\n\n- 2020 to 2030: Saint-Gobain is rolling out its '2030 carbon' roadmap, which has two ambitions:\n- 4 achieving, between 2017 and 2030, the reduction targets (in absolute terms) of 33% of CO2e emissions under scopes 1 and 2 and a 16% reduction in CO2e emissions under scope 3. These objectives are validated by the Science-Based Targets initiative (SBTi), which considers them to be aligned with the Paris agreement and a 1.5\u00b0C trajectory.\n- 4 innovating and testing industrial processes to achieve net zero emissions for the three scopes.\n- 2030 to 2050: the roadmap will be adapted based on the results obtained during the previous period. The innovations identified during the implementation of the '2030 carbon' roadmap will be rolled out. Carbon capture projects may be activated at the end of the period to supplement the transformation measures up to a maximum of 10% of emissions (scopes 1, 2 and 3).\n\n## Four levers for achieving the 2030 objectives (scope 1 and 2)\n\n## Product optimization and eco-design\n\nSaint-Gobain can take action to lighten products while guaranteeing at least equivalent performance, optimize packaging to reduce the impact of logistics, and modify formulations to incorporate more recycled materials.\n\nIn the glazing sector, replacing one tonne of virgin composition with its equivalent in cullet (recycled glass) reduces CO 2 emissions by 300 kg.\n\n## Industrial process improvements and productivity\n\nOperational excellence, productivity, energy efficiency and quality are at the heart of the 2030 carbon roadmap. The deployment of digital technologies and the use of data enable us to better control industrial processes and gain in efficiency. The Construction Industry Business Unit uses software based on artificial intelligence to optimize the operation of its glass fiber furnaces.\n\nOur contributions: committing to a better world\n\n## Innovation\n\nTo ensure the transition to carbon-neutral production, an R&D program has been initiated for 2021. Net zerocarbon production trials (scope 1 and 2) have been carried out for most of Saint-Gobain's businesses, in particular glass, gypsum and insulation. After a pilot production of zero-carbon glass (scope 1 and 2) in France in 2023, a successful trial of glass production using 30% hydrogen in Germany verified the technical feasibility of switching energy sources.\n\n## Use of decarbonized energies\n\nBy 2023, the share of decarbonized electricity in total electricity consumption increased to to 57%, an increase of 5 points between 2022 and 2023 thanks to the signing of new power purchase agreements and green electricity contracts in every region of the world.\n\nSaint-Gobain benefited from more than 120 contracts of decarbonated electricity in 2023.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Managing scope 3 carbon emissions\n\nSaint-Gobain has stepped up its efforts to identify and assess CO 2 emissions linked to its value chain. Digital tools have been developed to facilitate assessments, particularly of emissions in categories 1, 4 and 9. These three categories account for around 85% of Saint -Gobain's scope 3 emissions (SBTi scope).\n\nTo reduce scope 3 emissions, Saint-Gobain is focusing on the following actions:\n\n- mobilizing buyers by providing training and digital tools for estimating the impact of purchases.\n- extend reporting to the relevant scope of our suppliers and improve the quality of information\n- engage suppliers to measure their carbon footprint and develop reduction action plans.",

        "page_content": "The Group's markets at the heart of global challenges\n\n## 2.1 THE GROUP'S MARKETS AT THE HEART OF GLOBAL CHALLENGES\n\n## 2.1.1 TRANSFORMING CONSTRUCTION\n\n## A - The urgency of sustainable construction\n\nConstruction  is  one  of  the  sectors  most  exposed  to  the consequences  of  global  megatrends  (see  section  1.3.1, p. 28) including climate change , urbanization, population growth ,  and depletion of natural resources .  It  is  also  one of the sectors with the highest environmental footprint, in terms  of  greenhouse  gas  emissions  (nearly  37%  of  the global  total) 1 , raw  material  consumption  and  waste production.  The  response  to  the  challenges  created  by these  megatrends  therefore  necessarily  involves  the transformation of the sector towards sustainable construction; this is an absolute priority for our societies.\n\nThis urgency has many facets, from sobriety (limiting the consumption of raw materials and energy), to circularity (increasing the reuse of production waste and end-of-life materials in  the  production  chain),  to respect for people (moving  towards  safer  and  less  arduous  construction processes), urban  planning (developing  cities  that  are more  pleasant  to  live  in  and  more  resilient  to  climate change)  or inclusion (giving access to accessible, affordable and healthy housing for all). This paradigm shift requires a relentless pursuit of technological innovation . It forces  us  to  rethink  construction  processes,  too,  in particular by developing light construction. It also requires us  to  listen  to, involve and mobilize all stakeholders concerned  (see  section  1.3.2,  p.  30):  designers  of  the building,  political  institutions,  promoters,  builders,  end users. What we are left with is rejuvenated practices and a reinvented  way  to  share  responsibilities  and  the  value created, with a long-term perspective.\n\nBeyond the transformation of its own model, Saint-Gobain wishes to play a leading role and involve its stakeholders in  this  approach, throughout  the  value  chain  of  the markets in  which  it  operates.  This  is  why  the  Group  has launched  the  Sustainable  Construction Observatory in April  2023 . As  part  of  this  initiative,  Saint-Gobain  is publishing  a Barometer of sustainable  construction, enabling  progress  in  this  area  to  be  monitored  and measured  on  a  global  scale.  We  also  publish  the  digital magazine 'Constructing a Sustainable Future', in order to promote  best  practices.  Finally,  the  Group  organizes meetings, the 'Sustainable Construction Talks' , to encourage the exchange of ideas with our stakeholders on the challenges and opportunities of sustainable construction. The challenges  of  sustainable  construction are  everyone's  responsibility;  it  is  only  by  working together that we can meet them.\n\n(1)\n\n\u00cb\n\n## B - The transition to sustainable construction\n\n## a. Sustainable construction solutions\n\nSaint-Gobain aims to provide its customers with solutions that satisfy not only their quest for performance but also the  requirements  of  sustainable  development.  These solutions, which combine products, systems and services, are  evaluated  (see  section  1.4.7,  p.  46)  in  terms  of  the response  to  the  global  challenges  of  climate  change (by  decarbonizing  construction),  protection  of  natural resources (by reducing resource extraction) and urbanization and population growth (by providing everyone with healthy and affordable housing).\n\nThis  approach  can  be  found  in  many  of  the  solutions developed by the Group to meet the expectations of its customers, from prefabrication (which limits waste during installation  and  reduces  construction  times,  in  order  to deliver  the  expected  buildings  more  quickly)  to  the recovery  of  worksite  waste  (which  makes  it  possible  to develop  the  recycling  and  reuse  of  materials),  via  3D printing (which makes it possible to very precisely adjust the  quantity  of  materials  required  for  construction), product systems (making it possible to increase productivity,  to  reduce  installation  times  and  increase safety for craftsmen), or digital tools and services (which make  it  possible,  for  example,  to  improve  the  design  of buildings  and  optimize  logistics  and  reduce  greenhouse gas emissions).\n\n## b. Light construction\n\nUnlike  a  traditional  construction  whose  massive  walls (bricks, cement, etc.) carry the weight of the building, light construction consists of constructing a skeleton - made of wood, metal, concrete or a combination of these materials - on which light fa\u00e7ade systems and internal partitions are connected.  This  type  of  construction,  partially  or  fully carried out on  site or prefabricated, reduces  the environmental  impact of  construction  and optimizes resource consumption while ensuring superior performance . While it is traditional in certain markets, such as individual housing in the United States and Scandinavian  countries, this  approach  is  intended  to develop  very  rapidly  throughout  the  world due  to  the decisive  advantages  it  brings,  particularly  in  terms  of speed of construction. This concerns emerging countries, where  dynamic  demographics  generate  strong  demand for new housing, as well as a series of developed countries, which are suffering from a shortage of residential premises (see section 1.4.6.B, p. 44), and those where qualified labor is  in  short  supply,  as  light  construction  techniques  have particular  advantages  in  terms  of  ease  of  construction, transformation and dismantling. It's about building quickly, better  and  cheaper.  In  France,  the  RE2020  regulation, which  requires  measuring  a  building's  environmental impact throughout its life, will encourage the development of light construction and recycled and recyclable materials with  lower  carbon  intensity.  Many  similar  initiatives  in Sweden, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, the United States,  Brazil  and  South  Africa  are  moving  in  the  same direction.

        "page_content": "strong  expertise,  offers  significant  growth  prospects  in many  markets,  in  all  construction  segments.  Engineering woods now represent a growing potential for Saint -Gobain:  excellent  alternatives  to  load-bearing  walls, with  laminated  wood  panels  (CLTs)  replacing  those  in reinforced  concrete,  while  poles  or  beams  in  laminated and  glued  (commonly  referred  to  as  GlueLam)  or laminated  wood  (LVL)  replace  steel.  The  lightness  and mechanical  resistance  of  engineering  woods  makes  it possible  to  build  ever  higher  residential  towers,  and  can even  meet  certain  seismic  requirements.  However,  the very nature of the material opens the way to sustainable construction,  with  a  low  carbon  footprint  for  wood construction.  While  it  is  a  popular  solution  for  new properties  (particularly  as  part  of  RE2020),  wood  is  also suitable  for  renovation,  particularly  for  elevations  or extensions.  Wood  construction  also  allows  for  innovative approaches;  the  city  of  L\u00fcbeck  in  Germany  has  chosen Saint -Gobain  Br\u00fcggemann  to  build  a  temporary  primary school with its wooden modules. The interim establishment will be moved after a few years to be used elsewhere for other purposes.\n\nLight  construction  solutions  such  as  fa\u00e7ade  systems  and lightweight  partitions  also  provide  significant  benefits  in terms of the quantity of materials consumed (-79% in the case  of  a  residential  building)  and  greenhouse  gas emissions,  thus  making  a  crucial contribution  to  the objectives of construction decarbonization and orientation  towards  a  circular  economy .  Prefabrication techniques consist of manufacturing the various components of a building in a factory, including water and electricity circuits, and assembling them on site. They are a solution  to  the  challenge  of  labor  shortages  and, with lower production and construction costs ,  they  also  save time  (by  as  much  as  25-50%  with  prefabrication,  for example)  as  well  as delivering  of  more  affordable housing , meeting  both  the  imperatives  of  protecting household  purchasing  power  in  developed  countries  and providing  decent  and  comfortable  housing  for  all  in emerging economies. Singapore, Australia and the UK are increasingly  opting  for  modular  buildings  to  deal  with labor and housing shortages; the Nordic countries, such as Sweden, are already building 90% of individual prefabricated homes. In Norway, Byggsystemer, a subsidiary of the Optimera retailer and leader in its market, is surfing this wave  by  offering  several  types  of prefabrication,  from  pre-distribution  of  wood  to  roof structures  and  ready-to-use  items  for  small  homes  and large buildings. Among the offers developed by the Group,\n\nThe Group's markets at the heart of global challenges\n\nGlasroc  X  plasterboard,  covered  by  a  technical  mineral pulp  developed  by  Adfors,  can  be  used  on  the  fa\u00e7ade, owing  to  its  improved  resistance  to  humidity  and  UV radiation. A new production line dedicated entirely to the manufacture of coated glass matting was opened in 2022 in  the  Czech  Republic.  In  Germany,  in  2021,  Saint -Gobain renovated  a  childcare  center  in  just  three  months,  using custom  prefabricated  and  pre-cut  panels.  In  India,  the combination of advanced glazing and modular construction  techniques  enabled  the  construction,  in  just 45 days, of the Indian Ministry of Defense's research and development  center  in  Bangalore,  a  1.3  million  square meters  building.  In  France,  the  Saint-Joseph  Hospital chose to use Isover's F4 fa\u00e7ades, sized and pre-decoupled in  the  factory;  they  are  easy  to  disassemble  and  recycle, facilitating future expansion projects.\n\nFor  Saint -Gobain,  which  offers  a  very  wide  range  of expertise in this field, light construction is at the heart of its contribution  to  a  more  environmentally  friendly economy.\n\n## c. Construction chemicals\n\nAlso  at  the  cutting  edge  of  the  sector's  transformation, construction  chemicals , which  groups  together  all  the chemical  components  used  to  paste,  join,  waterproof, protect,  strengthen  and  perfect  different  construction materials,  both  in  new  construction  and  renovation,  for buildings  and  infrastructures  (tunnels,  bridges,  roads, railways, dams, etc.). This sector takes a leading role as its innovative  technologies -  and  its  multiple  applications  reduce energy consumption, reduce the carbon footprint of  cement  and  concrete,  and  promote  the  circular economy . They therefore play a major role in the transition to low-carbon construction and are an essential component  of  the  Group's  strategy  to  be  the  leader  in sustainable  construction;  this  is  why  Saint -Gobain  is strengthening its leadership and accelerating its growth in this sector, through the acquisition of Chryso in September  2021  and  GCP  Applied  Technologies  in September 2022. Construction chemicals now account for more than 270 Saint -Gobain sites, spread over 75countries.  This  market  is  currently  estimated  to  be worth  between  \u20ac80  billion  and  \u20ac90  billion,  with  annual growth  significantly  higher  than  that  of  the  construction market in general. The Group, with a revenue of more than \u20ac5.7 (2) billion  and  a  rich  portfolio  of  brands  (including Weber, Chryso, Impac and TekBond), is clearly positioned among the world's leading players in this key segment.",

The accelerated shift of the automotive sector to electric vehicles , driven  by  rapid  innovation  and  increasing regulatory  pressure,  requires  technologies  that  enable progress  in  terms  of shared  mobility , automation and connectivity as well as lower vehicle weight, and thermal and acoustic  insulation of  the  passenger  compartment. With  brands  such  as  Sekurit,  Saint -Gobain  manufactures and  delivers  windshields,  side  windows,  rear  windows, glass  roofs  and  pre-assembled  modules  to  major  car manufacturers.  These  solutions  ensure  everyday  comfort for drivers and passengers and respond to the changes in mobility in terms of use and regulations, notably regarding to the environment. The Group is thus a key player in the transition  of  the  automotive  market  (see  section  1.4.6, p.  42).  As  one  of  the  leaders  in  the  glazing  market  for electric  vehicles,  it  offers  a  whole  series  of  solutions  (in particular  with systems  for  insulation , batteries and electric motors ) to improve their performance in terms of energy  efficiency,  well-being,  security  and  connectivity. The Group is present in every part of the transport market\n\n\u00cb\n\nwith  glazing  intended  for  the  aerospace  and  rail  sectors, ships and industrial vehicles.\n\nFor  many  of  its  industrial  customers,  Saint -Gobain provides  high  performance  solutions  and  meets  market expectations  thanks  to  its  capacity  for  innovation,  its research  and  development  potential  (see  section  1.4.3, p.  39),  its  proximity  to  its  clients  and  its  use  of  digital technology and data analysis (see section 1.4.2, p. 38).\n\nThe Group draws on strong expertise in materials science and formulation science. It has expertise in multiple stateof-the-art  applications  that  make  use  of  the  specific properties  of  its  materials  (high  temperature  resistance, abrasion, chemical stability, surface properties, etc.). Many products are developed jointly with clients to cater to their needs, particularly in plastics , construction chemicals , and high  performance  ceramics and refractory  products for the  metalworking and glass  manufacturing  industries . These areas of expertise are essential for the decarbonization of industry.",

Beyond  the  traditional  approach  of meeting a specific need with an appropriate product, the objective  is  to  offer  its  clients end-to-end  support  for complex  issues modeled  as  use  cases,  in  other  words, illustrations of specific cases such as the construction of a single-family  house  or  the  renovation  of  a  hospital.  The Group  analyzed  all  of  its  product  and  service  lines  to define  22  use  cases  in  which  it  offers solutions  for  local markets (new  construction and renovation for residential and non-residential buildings) and four use cases in which it proposes solutions  for  global  markets (sustainable construction, sustainable mobility, sustainable industry).\n\nSaint -Gobain's  organization  by  country  and  by  market enables it to operate as close as possible to its clients and anticipate  their  expectations,  taking  into  account  local specificities,  whether  in  terms  of  architectural  styles, building  methods,  climate,  standards  and  regulations,  or cultural particularities. By capitalizing on this proximity to its  clients,  by  combining  its  skills,  by  inventing  new services, by strengthening synergies between its business lines,  by  accelerating  innovation  and  use  of  data,  by offering  its  employees  an  open  and  inclusive  working environment, the Group differentiates itself and offers the\n\nwidest  range  of  integrated  solutions  on  the  market to better  meet  the  expectations  of  its  clients,  as  well  as performance and sustainable development challenges.\n\n## B - \u2026 incorporating strong business expertise\n\n## Gypsum\n\nPlasterboard and plaster based solutions and construction systems  for  partitions  and  coverings  for  walls,  fa\u00e7ades, in terms of thermal and acoustic comfort, fire protection and humidity  resistance,  thus  meeting  the  growing  market Gobain's vision, formulated as part of the 'Grow & Impact' plan, and\n\nceilings and floors provide Group clients with benefits demand.  Gypsum  is  a  decisive  asset  in  Saint -which  aims  to  make  the  company the  worldwide  leader particulary  in light  and sustainable  construction .  Among the advantages of this construction method  depending on the  type  of  building,  wall  construction  processes  using plaster-based partitions can notably produce time savings of  20%  to  50%  compared  to  traditional  materials (1) ,  and\n\nbring  environmental  benefits  such  as  reduced  impacts  in\n\n(1)\n\nterms  of  CO2  emissions  and  water  consumption.  In emerging  markets  in  particular,  the  replacement  of traditional masonry walls with plasterboard walls represents a very significant source of growth.\n\nTo develop this offer, the Group extracts and transforms gypsum into an extensive range of plaster-based products and systems for the construction and renovation markets, through all of its brands such as Placo\u00ae, Rigips and Gyproc (see  section  2.2.2,  p.  73),  thanks  to  increasingly  efficient industrial facilities, particularly in terms of energy consumption,  diversification  of  energy  sources,  and  the commissioning of the first 'low-carbon' plasterboard plant in  Norway  starting  in  2023.  These  solutions  comply  with the  highest  technological  standards and  Saint -Gobain promotes  their  widespread  adoption,  they  also  remain  a step  ahead  of  new  regulations  concerning,  for  example, the  elimination  of  formaldehyde  to  improve  interior  air quality (Activ'Air).\n\nGypsum  is  mostly  recyclable  under  certain  conditions, thanks to processes enabling the removal of contaminants. The  Group  has  waste  recovery  and  gypsum  recycling services  in  a  dozen  countries  in  order  to  supply  its industrial sites with recycled raw materials (up to 30% of input  materials  in  some  plants),  also  contributing  to  the Group's  strategic  positioning  in  the  global  movement  to expand  the  circular  economy.  Saint-Gobain  continues  to develop  in  this  market,  strengthening  its  presence  and industrial capacity. In March 2023, Saint-Gobain Rigips and Dalsan  Al\u00e7i  merged  their  activities  in  Turkey  to  create  a leader  in  plaster  and  plasterboards.  In  September  2022, the  Group  launched  the  world's  first  plasterboard  made from 50% recycled plaster. Known as Placo\u00ae Infini 13, this innovation was developed at the Placo\u00ae plant in Chamb\u00e9ry, France, but also in other countries including Italy (where a board  containing  30%  recycled  gypsum  was  developed and  placed  on  the  market)  and  Spain  (with  Placoplanet, which has a recycled gypsum content of 28%).\n\n## Insulation\n\nIn residential and non-residential buildings , Saint -Gobain's insulation market  offering  meets the  challenges  of reducing  energy  consumption  and  improving  thermal and  acoustic  comfort .  All  of  its  brands,  such  as  Isover, CertainTeed and Izocam, offer a wide range of products, from mineral wools (glass wool, stone wool), to polystyrene and polyurethane foams - on specific markets -,  to  bio-sourced  products  (wood  fibers),  thus  covering the  insulation  needs  of  all  types  of  buildings  as  well  as their  interior  installations  (roofs,  walls,  floors).  Its  offer brings  benefits  in  terms  of ease  of  installation for professionals and in terms of efficiency and sustainability for investors and owners.\n\nLevers for outperforming",

It is complemented by a whole range of solutions for insulating heating or air conditioning systems,  improving  their  efficiency  and  reducing  their energy consumption. The Climaver range, for example, is a 'two-in-one' product that replaces metal ducts as well as the thermal and acoustic insulation used to protect them. The  solutions  proposed  by  Saint -Gobain  for  the  exterior and  interior  insulation  of  walls  also support  the  strong momentum in the renovation market (see section 1.4.6.A, p.  42),  with  innovations  such  as  Optimax  Habito,  which saves installation time by 20% on average (2) ,  reduces the risk of injury, and also reduces worksite waste and makes the materials used in this solution completely recyclable.\n\nThe Group also provides cutting-edge insulation solutions for a very wide range of applications outside construction, ranging  from  engine  compartments  and  vehicle  interiors (cars,  railcars,  ships,  etc.)  to  household  appliances  and photovoltaic panels.\n\nIn  the  insulation  market,  Saint -Gobain  is  once  again demonstrating its commitment to circularity .  It  should be remembered  that mineral wools can be recycled indefinitely  under  certain  conditions.  In  France,  Isover  is the  first  player  in  the  market  to  have  launched  a glass wool  waste  recovery  service , recycling  the  waste  by reinjecting it back into the company's production process. The Group acts both through the technical characteristics of  its  solutions  and  through  initiatives  such  as  its  ILOOP project,  supported  by  the  European  Union,  to  contribute to the gradual recovery of glass wool waste generated on construction  or  demolition  sites,  as  well  as  through  its participation  in  the  European  project  for  the  recovery  of mineral wool waste, WOOL2LOOP.\n\n## Construction chemicals and mortars\n\nProtecting, repairing, strengthening, perfecting, decorating and  even  decarbonizing  are  among  the  key  functions  of Saint -Gobain's  offering.  The  Group  is  one  of  the  world leaders in the field of mortars and construction chemicals with brands such as Weber, Chryso and GCP.\n\nThe  Group's  special  tiling  and  fa\u00e7ade  coating  solutions ensure  safety  and  ease  of  use.  In  flooring,  its  solutions cover  various  fields  of  application:  new  and  renovated subfloors,  leveling  and  finishing  prior  to  laying  a  floor, protective coatings for industrial flooring, decoration with the use of self-colored mortars, solutions for heavily used floors  and  underfloor  heating,  as  well  as  a  pump  truck service  to  improve  the  productivity  and  comfort  of installers.\n\nA  range  of  technical  mortars  and  coatings  is  available, covering  all  areas  of  construction,  to  help  in  structural work,  rework  and  waterproofing  solutions.  A  line  of admixtures  also  caters  to  the  growing  demand  for improved  technical  properties  in  concrete  for  use  in construction and a reduction in the carbon impact.\n\nThe  Group  is  expanding  rapidly  on  the  construction chemicals market, notably thanks to the acquisition in 2021 of  Chryso,  specializing  in  admixtures  for  construction materials, providing differentiated and innovative solutions and  employing  1,300  people,  as  well  as  significant acquisitions  in  Mexico  (Impac  -  liquid  and  bitumen waterproofing),  in  Romania  (Duraziv  -  mortar  and  paint specialist), and in Peru (Z Aditivos). In 2022, Saint -Gobain\n\n(2)\n\n\u00cb\n\ncontinued to grow in the construction chemicals markets with the acquisition of GCP Applied Technologies, a global player  in  concrete  admixtures,  cement  additives  and waterproofing solutions, comprising around 1,800 people. In 2023, Saint-Gobain also acquired Matchem in Brazil and IDP  Chemicals  in  Egypt  to  consolidate  its  position  in construction  chemicals,  particularly  in  some  cement additives, which play a key role in the decarbonization of the  construction  industry.  The  Group  continued  its development in this sector through the acquisition of Adfil, whose  high-performance  fibers  help  reduce  the  carbon footprint  of  reinforced  concrete,  improve  the  lead  times and productivity of construction projects, and increase the lifetime  of  the  concrete.  Saint-Gobain  also  acquired Izomaks,  a  leading  player  in  waterproofing  products (floors, roofs) in Saudi Arabia, as well as Menkol, a leading player in India, specializing in high-performance waterproofing systems for foundations.\n\nSaint -Gobain  also  announced  a  major  partnership  with Ecocem,  an  Irish  company  specializing  in  low-carbon cement.  This  partnership  focuses  on  accelerating  the delivery  of  low-carbon  products  to  market.  Designed  to reduce CO2 emissions from cement, mortar and concrete, these  products  will  support  the  acceleration  of  the construction industry's transition to a low-carbon economy.  These  acquisitions  represent  a  decisive  step towards establishing  the  Group  as  a  worldwide  leader  in construction chemicals, with more than \u20ac5 billion in sales. Pooling  these  resources  and  solutions  offers  clients  a highly comprehensive portfolio and global coverage.\n\n## Ceilings\n\nThrough its portfolio  of  complementary  brands ,  such  as Ecophon,  CertainTeed,  Eurocoustic,  Sonex,  and  Vinh Tuong, Saint-Gobain is one of the world leaders in ceiling solutions , providing  benefits  particularly  in  terms  of thermal and acoustic insulation. The Group offers a wide range  of  multi-material  solutions for  ceilings  and  wall panels  that  combine  acoustics  and  aesthetics  for  the comfort  and  well-being  of  the  end  user.  Its  main  brand, Ecophon,  develops  high-performance  acoustic  systems (capable of halving noise pollution) intended primarily for non-residential markets (offices, schools, healthcare buildings). In 2022, the Group strengthened its presence in the  acoustic  insulation  and  ceiling  markets  through  the acquisition  of  several  international  companies,  including Clipso  and  Fade.  These  acquisitions  complement  the Group's know-how and geographical presence to offer to all its clients the most suitable solutions for their projects, whether  it  be  museums,  schools,  hospitals,  offices, collective  or  individual  housing,  or  professional  recording studios.\n\n## Glazing for buildings and vehicles\n\nTo address the challenges associated with protecting the environment, aesthetics,  comfort,  ergonomics  and  safety, Saint -Gobain  develops,  produces  and  sells high-tech glazing  solutions intended  for  the  fa\u00e7ade,  window  and interior  decoration  markets  and  to  protect  assets  and people. With brands such as Saint -Gobain Glass, GlassSolutions,  Vetrotech  and  SageGlass  (section  2.2.2, p.  73),  the  Group's  offering  ranges  from  the  production and transformation of flat glass to the distribution of glass solutions for the building market.",

        "page_content": "Saint -Gobain  aspires  to  be  the  partner  of  choice  for  its clients:  installers,  processors,  manufacturers,  distributors and  architects.  The  Group's  glass  solutions provide benefits in terms of both performance and sustainability . Infinitely recyclable under certain conditions, glass, in all its forms  -  from  window  and  fa\u00e7ade  glass  to  automotive glass - is one of the areas where the Group's commitment to the development of the circular economy materializes (see section 3.4, p. 124). This requires both investment in industrial processes - in particular to eliminate all types of contaminants  present  in  glass  waste  -  and  also  the development  of  efficient and  sustainable collection networks. It is in this spirit that Saint -Gobain Glass France signed  partnership  agreements  from  2019  with  several companies  specializing  in  the  recovery  of  end-of-life windows.  At  the  same  time,  Saint -Gobain  Glass  is developing  several  cullet  sorting  lines  on  its  flat  glass manufacturing  sites,  to  ensure  optimal  sorting  before adding this secondary material to the product mix. During spring  2022,  the  Saint -Gobain  Group  achieved  a  world first:  manufacturing  flat  glass  with  100%  cullet  and  100% green energy, for a zero-carbon production (scope 1 and 2). Following this world first, Saint -Gobain Glass launched the  world's  first  low-carbon  glass,  Ora\u00e9\u00ae.  The  carbon footprint  of  Ora\u00e9\u00ae  is  40%  lower  than  the  European average  for  Saint -Gobain  clear  glass,  and  it  is  produced with a high content of recycled glass (64% cullet). Ora\u00e9 is combined with the most efficient thin-film glazing in order to  reduce  both  carbon  emissions  during  use  and  the carbon footprint of the product.\n\nThey improve the energy efficiency of buildings and user comfort in all its dimensions : thermal insulation, control of light  inputs,  aesthetics,  interior  design  and  decoration, protection  against  bullets  and  fire.  These  properties  are obtained  as  a  result  of  thin  film  technologies:  using physical and chemical methods, stacks of films transform the glass into functional glazing. This means that the most complex glazing can  consist  of  up  to  twenty  successive layers.  Saint -Gobain  presents  itself  as  the  technological leader  in  the  sector  by  bringing  to  market  innovations such  as  Priva-Lite  active  glazing,  which  is  electrically opaque on demand, or SageGlass solutions, with variable tint,  mainly  offered  for  fa\u00e7ade  projects.  State-of-the-art offers  also  meet  specific  needs:  glazing  with  burglar resistance or fire protection capabilities.\n\nThe Group's glazing solutions play an essential role in both the  construction  market  and  the  renovation  market  (see section 1.4.6.A and 1.4.6.B, p. 42-44) by providing strategic benefits,  particularly  in  terms  of  energy  savings.  In  the case of the construction of an office building in India, for example,  this  results  in  savings  of  9%  on  the  annual expenditure  on  temperature  regulation  (i.e.,  more  than \u20ac50,000 per year) compared with standard glazing. These advances include solutions such as the integration of Eclaz One in fa\u00e7ade solutions for the construction of new multifamily  buildings,  or  Planitherm  Stadip  glass  for  the renovation of single-family homes, in particular to increase the reflection of thermal infrared rays and limit the loss of heat by radiation.\n\nLevers for outperforming\n\nSaint -Gobain  is  present  with  its  glazing  solutions  across the entire value chain of the transport market (cars, trucks, public transport, rail, aerospace industry), from production to distribution and  maintenance.  In  these  strongly innovation-oriented sectors, the Group provides its clients with solutions thanks to brands such as Saint -Gobain (flat glass  manufacturing  and  sales),  Sekurit,  a  brand  with  a long history of bringing safety and comfort benefits to the automotive  market  (automotive  glass  and  windshields), Sekurit Service (production and distribution of replacement  glazing),  GlassDrive  and  France  Pare  Brise (automotive glass fitting and repairing).\n\n## Exterior products\n\nSaint -Gobain, through its CertainTeed and Brasilit brands, is present in the United States and in Latin America with a full range of outdoor products. For roofs, the Group offers premium  asphalt  and  composite  shingles,  solar  roofing solutions, roll roofing  systems  and  accessories.  For fa\u00e7ades,  it  offers  polymer  shakes  and  shingle,  and insulation  cladding  solutions.  Saint -Gobain  also  supplies solutions  such  as  barriers,  terraces  and  balustrades. Solutions incorporating these various products provide the Group's clients with benefits in terms of aesthetics, ease of installation  and  maintenance,  and  resistance  to  bad weather.\n\n## Distribution of products, solutions and services for construction and housing\n\nSaint -Gobain serves hundreds of thousands of clients each year on the construction, renovation and home improvement  markets . With  brands  such  as  CEDEO, Point.P,  Optimera  and  Dahl,  the  Group  has  a  network  of strong  and  complementary  brands,  both  generalist  and specialist.  Primarily  oriented  towards  trade  clients,  the Saint -Gobain trading brands also serve small and mediumsized  businesses  and  large  companies  and allow  for  a presence  of  the  Group  across  the  whole  construction value chain . They  also  support  individuals in the completion  of  their  projects  with  professionals.  The various brands thus strive to balance their client portfolios, a  guarantee  of  solidity  and  profitability.  Another  major asset  is  the  regional  network:  in  France,  the  Group  has more than 2,000 sales outlets, anchored in the local fabric, able to serve the most dynamic economic areas.\n\nThe Group's expertise in the field of distribution is key to achieving the strategic goals of the 'Grow & Impact' plan (section 1.4.1, p. 36-37) by providing its professional clients with a large array of solutions and making Saint -Gobain a one-stop-shop  provider .  It  also  allows  for  a  very  high degree of proximity with the Group's clients , thanks to the value brought by data collection and analysis (section 1.4.2, p.  38)  and  thanks  to  the  support  the  Group  provides  its clients across the board, including training on its products and  services  (see  below).  It  also  enables  the  Group  to capture  the  structural  growth  of  the  residential  building renovation market in Europe (section 1.4.6.A, p. 42-43).",

        "page_content": "Levers for outperforming\n\nLogistics  is  essential  to  distribution  and  receives  special attention  through  the  automation  and  robotization  of processes. The trading brands are making their system of centralized  logistics  bases  and  adapted  delivery  centers increasingly efficient. This allows for a successful deployment of Saint -Gobain's e-commerce offering (regarding  delivery  times  especially)  for  low-volume  and low-weight  products  in  particular.  To  support  logistics, robust  information  systems  are  necessary.  Thanks  in particular to data collection and analysis , digital technology is  one  of  the  tools  available  to  the  Group's brands to offer clients a unique omnichannel experience : e-commerce,  m-commerce,  enhanced  product  content (features,  descriptions,  visuals,  technical  and  regulatory sheets, etc.), as well as digital services that save time. The teams  also  benefit  from  productivity  tools  (robotic process  automation),  machine  learning  and  optimal  data exploitation using data processing algorithms. This approach  allows  the  Group  to  better  understand  and model product and client targets to optimize the work of the  sales  force.  Ultimately,  digital  technology  acts  as  a lever to boost Saint -Gobain's growth.\n\nThrough  distribution,  the  Group  is  also  committed  to supporting its professional clients throughout their journey.  On  the  French  market,  the  Group  is  actively delivering on this commitment  by  designing and marketing services ranging from training (via the creation of apprentice training centers or in 2023, more than 5,000 customers trained in  theartisans  label  have  logged  on  to the  RGE  application.  They  have  completed  more  than 27,000 test sessions. And nearly 400 artisans have been certified.  to  the  recovery  of  worksite  waste  (notably thanks  to  a  partnership  agreement  with  TriNCollect  and Ecodrop,  a  worksite  waste  collection  service),  digital solutions offering assistance with estimates and costing on worksites  (with  the  Solu+  platform),  and  the  rapid generation  of  estimates  and  invoices  (with  the  Tolteck solution).\n\nLastly, distribution is an area where  the Group's demanding stance in the area of responsibility materializes.  This  is  reflected,  for  example, in  the  search for  an  ever-smaller  delivery  logistics  footprint ,  notably thanks to 'low-carbon' delivery solutions, the optimization of circuits and the installation of sales outlets in the heart of urban areas, as well as through the use of distribution chains  as  an  essential  tool  in  the  collection  of  worksite waste, with a view to promoting the circular economy . In 2017,  Saint -Gobain  Building  Distribution  France  set  up structures  to  collect  waste  from  the  same  types  of construction  materials,  products  and  equ  ipment  that  it sells to professionals, thus becoming a key private network of worksite waste collection points in the construction and public  works  sector  thanks  to  300  multi-stream  waste disposal centers in France.\n\n## Pipes\n\nSaint -Gobain offers  complete  solutions drawing on more than 165 years of experience in  the  water supply market to meet the highest expectations. Through its PAM brands, the  Group  produces  and  markets  ductile  cast  iron  pipe systems  for  drinking  water  and  sanitation,  covers  and gratings  for  roads,  as  well  as  cast  iron  systems  for collecting  and  evacuating  wastewater  and  rainwater  in buildings. Saint -Gobain's offer is aimed at public authorities, public and private water companies, as well as players in the mining, hydroelectric and industrial markets.\n\n\u00cb\n\nTo  guarantee  the  preservation  of  water  quality  and  the sustainability of these solutions, the Group offers a set of certificates  and  approvals  in  full  compliance  with  all standards and regulations in force in its markets.\n\n## Construction industry\n\nSaint-Gobain manufactures glass fiber materials and a full range  of  textiles  and  coating  technologies  for  the sustainable  construction,  industry  and  mobility  markets. These  innovative  and  sustainable  solutions,  linked  to  an integrated model and a wide range of technologies, can be combined to meet customer needs:\n\n- \u00b7 a  full range  of  glass  fiber  materials  for  various applications in different markets;\n- \u00b7 a  wide  range  of  high-performance  and  customizable technical textiles based on glass fiber and polyester for industrial manufacturers  who  use  them  in  their construction systems;\n- \u00b7 glass fiber-based finished products for road construction and reinforcement applications that ensure durability, comfort and good finish for end users;\n- \u00b7 high-temperature  thermal  insulation  solutions  and protection against fire for the industry and sustainable mobility markets.\n\n## Surface solutions\n\nSaint -Gobain  offers comprehensive  solutions  to  shape, protect  and  bond  surfaces  of  all  materials .  Its  solutions include  abrasives,  adhesives,  sealants,  tapes,  foams,  and films for complex and challenging applications. By working closely  with  clients,  expert  partners,  and  end  users, Saint -Gobain  designs  and  provides  customized  surface solutions to secure the best option for performance, cost and  safety.  It  serves  a wide  range  of  global  and  local markets: construction and habitat (from rough cutting of concrete walls and floors to sanding of wooden floors and decorative  finishes), heavy  industry (steelworks,  paper mills,  and  mineral  extraction), manufacturing  and  hightech industries (automotive, aerospace, and electronics).\n\n## Ceramics\n\nSaint -Gobain  has  extensive  expertise  in  ceramics  and refractory  materials,  that  enables  the  Group  to  serve  a wide  variety  of  industries  such  as  the  metallurgy, automotive,  electric  batteries,  hydrogen,  aeronautics  and aerospace, electronics, telecommunications, security, defense, abrasives and chemicals.\n\nWith its unique research and development capacity in the field of technical ceramics, Saint-Gobain Ceramics partners with  industry  leaders  and  major  innovators  to  help  them meet  their  technical  challenges,  but  also  to  support  the decarbonization  of  industry  and  to  achieve  an  economy that is as circular as possible.\n\nIn  the  glass  industry,  for  example,  the  products  and solutions  offered  through  the  SEFPRO  subsidiary  enable its  clients  to  succeed  in  their  technological  transition towards  'low-carbon  glass'  by  electrifying  and  lowering their energy  consumption  in  order  to  reduce  CO2 emissions.  For  the  end  of  life  of  furnaces,  VALOREF, another  subsidiary  of  Saint -Gobain,  offers  a  service  to collect  used  ceramics,  which  are  recycled  as  much  as possible.",

        "page_content": "## 2.2.3 AN AGILE AND EFFICIENT STRUCTURE\n\n## A - A Group organized by country according to its clients\n\nSince 2019, Saint -Gobain has been organized according to its  clients  and  therefore  by  geographical  regions  for  its regional businesses, and by global Business Units within its High  Performance  Solutions  division,  with  a  view  to improving  agility  and  remaining  as  close  as  possible  to its client base . Based on the 'Transform & Grow' plan, the Group's corporate governance mode l, which is as close as possible  to  its  markets,  is  part  of  a  resolutely  'multinational'  approach.  The  new  organization  has  enabled  a profound culture change ,  highlighting the empowerment of teams , their performance , and the satisfaction of client needs,  and  granting  a  high  degree  of decision-making autonomy at local level.\n\nSaint -Gobain's  organization  and  culture  are  therefore profoundly  transformed,  with  a simplified  structure (one boss principle)  and  90%  of  CEOs  native  to  the  region  in which  they  operate.  The  new  rules  for  executive compensation  (bonus  entirely  linked  to  the  performance of  the  country  or  market)  are  aligned  with  performance: priority given to cash generation, ROCE, EBITDA and ESG impact  (on  greenhouse  gas  emissions,  diversity  and safety). In full control of the Group's development in their market,  they  also  aim  to  shape  the  evolution  of  local construction ecosystems.\n\n## B - A Group that leverages its global dimension\n\nAt the global level, the strength of an international group makes it possible to build a pool of expertise to support its local activities . First of all, this involves the widespread sharing of best practices .  The sharing of knowledge and expertise ,  essential to promote synergies, is facilitated by meetings between innovation and marketing professionals, and  has  materialized  with  the  creation  of  the  'Hive' community.  Evidence  also  of  this  dynamic  is  the  roll-out globally  via  the  \"Unicampus\"  program,  of  a  training  offer that  includes  courses  on  the  principal  central  offices (marketing, industrial performance, sustainable development, research and development, purchasing, etc.) combining theory, practice and experience sharing.\n\nThis  approach  also  involves setting  up  cross-business platforms at  Group level. It also involves the deployment of  shared  service  centers in areas  such  as  human\n\nresources  or  the  finance  function.  Saint -Gobain's  global dimension  also  allows  us  to  test  numerous  innovative business  models  in  different  contexts  and  promote  the exchange of best practices between countries.\n\nThis clearly differentiates Saint -Gobain from its competitors : in addition to its in-depth knowledge of local markets, the Group sets itself apart from local competitors through  its capacity  for  innovation  and  the  operational excellence provided by its cross-functional organization at global  level.  Through  the  richness  of  its  offering  and  its ability  to  offer  complete solutions adapted to each client segment,  Saint -Gobain  stands  out  from  its  local  and international competitors.\n\nSaint -Gobain's  new  organization,  in  general,  encourages synergies in support functions : with unique client services, shared  online  stores  and  common  logistics,  sales  forces can work more efficiently and devote more time to crossselling  and  upselling.  It  has  also  led  to changes  in  sales organizations, in particular to develop cross-selling .  The search for synergies is an essential condition for the Group to be a solution provider (see section 1.4.7, p. 46-47). On the other hand, the objective is to offer clients combined offers and to make the Group a one-stop shop for a given application. Using these synergies, Saint -Gobain improves the  client  experience by  offering  complete  building systems  along  with  exclusive  related  services.  The  client only  has  to  place  a  single  order  to  receive  all  of  the products at the worksite, while a Saint -Gobain team also ensures smooth progress of work on site.\n\nFinally, synergies are also generated through the spreading a culture of innovation (see section 1.4.3, p. 39) developing  dynamic  project  management  methods  and placing the client at the heart of the approach. This culture has  historically  been  expressed  in  different  ways  within Saint -Gobain:\n\n- \u00b7 The  Group's  industrial  business  lines  can  thus  benefit from  the  experience  of  retailers  in  terms  of  digitizing their product and service offering for clients;\n- \u00b7 The  regional  businesses,  in  the  construction  markets, are increasingly developing a co-development approach,  a  model  that  is  in  the  DNA  of  the  High Performance  Solutions  businesses.  They  thus  benefit from the experiences already existing within Saint -Gobain.\n\nLevers for outperforming",

        "page_content": "A responsible and efficient Group\n\n## 2.3\n\n## A RESPONSIBLE AND EFFICIENT GROUP\n\nWhile it is one of the oldest companies, Saint -Gobain is also one of the fastest-changing companies in recent years. Rather than thinking in terms of obstacles and steps, it is about developing a model that can adapt continuously, in the context of a world that has become fundamentally unstable. During this transformation, Saint-Gobain relied on its values to act responsibly in its interactions with its stakeholders.\n\n## 2.3.1 ETHICS AND COMPLIANCE\n\nAs  part  of  its  strategy  to  create  sustainable  growth, Saint -Gobain is committed to the ethical values shared in the Principles of Conduct and Action, its code of ethics.\n\nThe Principles  of  Conduct  and  Action  apply  to  all  Group entities  and  employees,  across  all  employment  contract types  (permanent  contracts,  fixed-term  contracts  and temporary workers) and all functions.\n\nThis code of ethics sets out the framework for the Group's collaboration with all its stakeholders, employees, customers,  shareholders,  suppliers  or  local  communities, and is based on local and international regulations as well as  international  standards  and  conventions  relating  to responsible conduct.\n\n## A - Applying Saint -Gobain's Principles of Conduct and Action\n\nThe Principles of Conduct and Action are the foundation of all Saint-Gobain  policies  and  commitments  (see section  1.1.3,  p.  17)  specifically  compliance  policies,  the human rights policy, the environmental, health and safety charter, 'buyer' and 'supplier' charters of the responsible purchasing program.\n\nThis  code of ethics is translated into 31 languages and is available  on  the  Group's  website  for  wide  distribution  to external  as  well  as  internal  stakeholders.  During  the recruitment  process  or  at  the  time  of  onboarding,  it  is communicated  to  each  new  employee,  including  those with  fixed-term  contracts  and  temporary  workers,  in  the language  of  the  country.  This  may  take  various  forms, depending on the country:\n\n- \u00b7 A welcome brochure with comments from the Human Resources representative or the manager;\n- \u00b7 The  code  of  ethics  directly  incorporated  into  the employment contract or the letter of commitment.\n\nAn  e-learning  course  called  'Adhere'  is  available  for  all employees  and  is  compulsory  for  all  new  managers  and has  to  be  repeated  every  2  years.  The  Saint -Gobain University  Management  School  offers  an  introduction  to business  ethics  to  allow  managers  to  discuss  issues  and share their operational experiences.\n\nThe Group has set for itself the goal of training each new manager, within the first year of integration, to the code of ethics,  the  fight  against  corruption  and  compliance  with competition  law  ('Adhere',  ACT  and  Comply).  This objective is included in the CSR dashboard monitored by the Board of Directors (see section 4.2.1, p. 152).\n\n\u00cb\n\nIn 2023, the Group celebrated 20 years of the Principles of Conduct and Action, through local events, video testimonials  from  employees  and  managers.  In  addition, nine 'PCA Live' events intended to highlight the actions of the Group and its employees were broadcast throughout 2023. On 18 April, employees were able to celebrate these 20  years  by  sharing  a  birthday  cake,  through  practical workshops,  games  or  debates.  A  video  by  Benoit  Bazin, the  Group's  Chief  Executive  Officer,  was  also  distributed to all employees to reaffirm the Group's commitment to its values,  in  particular  health  and  safety,  the  fight  against global warming and also the fight against corruption.\n\n## B - Deploying the ethics and compliance programs\n\nThe ethics and compliance program is based on a network of  professionals  working  centrally  and  in  the  regions  or activities, which meets monthly to discuss internal policies and  procedures,  training,  an  alert  system,  audits,  digital tools and appropriate reporting.\n\n## a.  Commitment of the management bodies\n\nIn ethics and compliance, the Board of Directors exercises control  over  general  management  and  ensures  that  the ethics  and  compliance program is properly implemented. An report is submitted to the Audit and Risk Committee every year.\n\nGeneral  Management  promotes  and  disseminates  the culture  of  ethics  and  compliance,  demonstrating  its commitment through the following actions:\n\n- \u00b7 Considering ethics and compliance issues in projects or strategic decisions: the Executive Committee is informed  once  a  month  about  ethical  and  compliance issues;\n- \u00b7 Implementing the ethics and compliance program with the support of the Ethics and Compliance Department;\n- \u00b7 Communicating its support for the ethics and compliance program as a whole, and more specifically this year its commitment to the Group's code of ethics on  the  20th  anniversary  of  the  Principles  of  Conduct and Action.\n\n## b.  Ethics and Compliance Department\n\nIts  mission  is  to  promote  and  defend  the  Principles  of Conduct  and  Action  and  to  design  and  implement  the Group's  ethics  and  compliance  program  in  the  areas  of competition law, the fight against corruption and influence peddling,  economic  sanctions  and  export  controls,  data protection, the duty of care and human rights. It identifies and  assesses  risks,  informs  the  Directors  and  proposes policies, procedures and programs to mitigate these risks and  conducts  internal  whistle-blowing  investigations. Finally, it develops and provides training and communication for the programs.",

The fight against corruption and influence peddling\n\nSince  2003,  Saint -Gobain  has  expressed  its  commitment to  the  fight  against  corruption  by  signing  the  United Nations Global Compact, the 10th principle of which calls on  companies  to  take  action  against  corruption.  A program is in place to prevent and detect corruption risk and  influence  peddling,  including  a  commitment  from executives and a strict prohibition of corruption.\n\nIn particular, this program is based on:\n\n- \u00b7 a  mapping  of  the  risks  of  corruption  and  influence peddling;\n- \u00b7 a policy and procedures;\n- \u00b7 a  digital  register  of  employee  declarations  regarding gifts  and  invitations  (given  or  received),  donations, patronage, sponsorship and conflicts of interest;\n- \u00b7 training,  in  particular  digital  training  known  as  'ACT', which is followed by all managers;\n- \u00b7 audits  conducted  internally  or  by  external  service providers;\n- \u00b7 a whistle-blowing system open to all Group employees and all other stakeholders;\n- \u00b7 disciplinary action for breaches.\n\n## b.  Competition law\n\nSaint -Gobain  has  put  in  place  a  competition  law compliance program based on:\n\n- \u00b7 a  policy,  'The  ins  and  outs  of  competition  law',  and procedures and practical data sheets, especially regarding  membership  with  professional  associations, which is now declared in a dedicated digital tool;\n- \u00b7 an  e-learning  training  course  called  'Comply'  is  first given  to  all  managers  during  onboarding  and  then repeated  regularly;  in-person  training  is  regularly organized as well as practical workshops;\n- \u00b7 audits conducted by external service providers (see section 6.2.2, p. 262).\n\n## c.  Economic sanctions and export control\n\nSaint -Gobain  has  implemented  a  program  for  compliance with economic sanctions and export controls. It is based on:\n\n- \u00b7 a Group trade compliance policy and detailed procedures;\n- \u00b7 a network of people in charge, deployed at the relevant level of the regional activities, the Business Units, or the country;\n\nA responsible and efficient Group\n\n- \u00b7 a verification tool (screening sanctions) of third parties and  country  files  to  identify  risks  and  apply  due diligence;\n- \u00b7 managers exposed to these issues undergo e-learning training;  in-person  training  is  provided  by  members  of the dedicated network;\n- \u00b7 'sanctions  and  export  control'  audits  conducted  by external service providers on Group entities previously identified by the central team.\n\n## d.  Personal data protection\n\nSaint -Gobain  pays  particular  attention  to  personal  data protection. The Group policy on this subject is available on its  website.  The  purpose  of  this  policy  is  to  set  out  data collection, use, communication and confidentiality conditions.\n\nAs  Saint -Gobain's  activities  are  highly  decentralized,  the data  protection  governance  aims  to  support  the  entities by taking into account their needs and the local context in which  they  operate.  Within  the  European  Union,  each Group entity must appoint a Privacy Correspondent who manages the compliance of activities with the support of a Privacy  Advisor  and  in  close  collaboration  with  the business  lines  (IT,  digital  technology,  marketing,  human resources,  etc.).  This  network  is  led  by  a  central  team (Data  Protection  Central  Team),  led  by  the  Group  Data Protection Officer. It is composed of 40 Privacy Advisors approximately  (lawyers  or  auditors)  and  about  400 Privacy Correspondents (operational profiles).\n\nOutside the European Union, the Legal Departments also take  these  issues  into  account.  Each  entity  must  appoint an employee who will be the point of contact dedicated to personal data protection issues. Saint -Gobain encourages the application of key  principles  of  personal  data protection,  regardless  of  the  location  of  the  entity.  As such,  in  the  main  countries  concerned,  these  principles provide protection beyond the local regulations in force.\n\nCommunication  actions  are  implemented  with  the  Data Protection Network  and  support  functions  (human resources,  IT,  etc.).  Practical  guides  and  procedures  are made  available  to  them.  Training  is  given,  in  particular through  an  e-learning  course  called  'Data  Protection  by Saint -Gobain'.\n\nSaint -Gobain  continues  to  roll  out  a  data  protection management platform in its European entities, and also in other regions. This platform facilitates the governance of personal  data  protection,  notably  by  keeping  records  of processing  activities,  assessing  the  guarantees  presented by service providers in terms of data protection, carrying out  related  Data  Protection  Impact  Analysis  (DPIAs),  the management  of  incidents  involving  personal  data,  etc. Training in the use of this platform is regularly offered to Privacy Correspondents and to Privacy Advisors.",

Taxation\n\nSaint -Gobain acts in compliance with the tax laws of the countries in which it operates and fulfills its tax reporting and payment obligations in time. The Group has therefore not established structures whose purpose is tax evasion. It applies  tax  laws  and  regulations  with  honesty  and integrity.  Its  intragroup  transactions  comply  with  the arm's-length principle.\n\n## 2.3.2 COMMITTED EMPLOYEES\n\n## A - Deploying an engaged HR policy\n\nSaint -Gobain's Human Resources (HR) policy ensures the provision  of  an  environment  that  is  conducive  to  the employee's professional and personal growth and balances job-related performance with their well-being. This policy requires  a  compulsory  buy-in  from  all  employees  for  the Group's  values  as  expressed  in  its  code  of  ethics,  the Principles  of  Conduct  and  Action.  Saint -Gobain's  human resources  policy  must  allow  for  rapid  adaptation  of  the organization  and,  in  particular,  careful  management  of changes  in  skills  requirements,  support  for  employees  in the face of major transformations, as well as attraction and retention of talent.\n\nTo do this, it incorporates two dimensions:\n\n- \u00b7 Global  coordination  tasked  with  defining  a  common framework  for  all  Group  employees,  incorporating ethical values, respect for human rights, the deployment  of  managerial  principles  based  on  trust, empowerment  and  collaboration,  and  the  offering  of training  programs  to  better  handle  major  cultural  and market transformations, the establishment of ambitious and  demanding  health  and  safety  objectives,  social protection,  diversity  or  any  other  subject  that  brings about decent working conditions for all;\n- \u00b7 Local  implementation,  by  the  HR  teams  in  charge  of social  dialog,  wage  policy,  local  adaptation  and  the implementation of action plans to achieve Saint -Gobain's objectives.\n\nThe  Human  Resources  Committee  meets  every  month under the chairmanship of the Executive Vice President in charge  of  Human  Resources  and  Corporate  Social Responsibility.  It  brings  together  the  Directors  of  the  HR support  functions,  in  particular  the  Director  of  Social Affairs  and  the  Director  of  Group  Talent  and  Executive Career  Management,  the  main  Directors  of  Human Resources  of  the  regions  and  the  Human  Resources Director  of  the  HPS  (High  Performance  Solutions)  entity. Regular  monitoring  of  local  and  global  action  plans  and analysis of key HR indicators are carried out.\n\nEach  country  implements  Saint -Gobain's  policies  and major  commitments  (health,  safety,  diversity,  etc.)  by adapting the action plans, stages of attainment and tools to  the  specific  features  and  culture  of  its  region  without compromising  on  the  expected  performance  level.  HR policies  are  disseminated  by  the  global  HR  network.  The local teams have guides to support their deployment, and special training sessions  are  organized  by  the  HR Academy.  Practical  guides  and  training  provided  by  the\n\n\u00cb\n\nEven  if  the  new  rules  related  to  the  reform  of  the international  tax  system  initiated  by  the  OECD  have  not yet all been defined, Saint -Gobain does not anticipate any significant  change  in  its  income  tax  expense  since  it  is correlated  with  its  locations  and  therefore  with  the creation of the value.\n\nglobal support teams are available for the following topics in  particular:  social  dialog,  diversity,  compensation  and benefits, talent management, recruitment and integration, and mobility.\n\nIn  addition,  when  companies  are  acquired,  coordination takes  place  in  order  to  align  the  HR  policies  of  the  new entities  with  the  Group's  principles.  Newly  integrated entities are monitored centrally to ensure that the policies applied  correspond  to  those  disseminated  by  the  Group and applied within the network.\n\nIn  addition  to  the  operational  HR  performance  indicators (see section 4.2.2.B, p. 158), the success of this policy and the  quality  of  social  dialog  are  measured  each  year  in  a survey  of  all  employees.  The  proportion  of  employees responding  to  the  survey,  their  satisfaction  with  working conditions, and their confidence in both the strategy and its implementation, are signs of a strong commitment that reinforces the Group's choice of a balance between local and global dimensions. For the past year, the number of employees  who  responded  to  the  survey  was  126,470, representing nearly 87% of the Group's workforce.\n\nSaint -Gobain  also  submits  its  human  resources  practices each year to the Top Employers Institute, an independent organization  that  evaluates  human  resources  and  ethical performance  on  the  basis  of  an  evaluation  questionnaire followed  by  audits  of  practices.  This  is  the  9th  year  in  a row  that  the  Group  has  been  ranked  among  the  15 companies  recognized  worldwide.  Saint -Gobain  is  also recognized  as  a  Top  Employer  locally  in  40  countries, corresponding to more than 89% of employees.\n\n## B - Building a culture of trust, responsibility and collaboration\n\nSaint-Gobain's  new  organization,  aiming  to  empower countries  and  at  local  level, entails  building  trust ,  as  a condition  for effective  delegation  of  authority and fostering  cross-functional  collaboration  between  all  the Group's functions and business lines at global level.\n\nThe  TEC  (Trust,  Empowerment,  Collaboration)  approach, which concerns all Group employees , applies to behavioral,  organizational and cultural  aspects of  life  at Saint-Gobain: trust, empowerment and collaboration lie at the  heart  of  Saint-Gobain's  transformation  and  growth model. This implies promoting reciprocity and environmentally  friendly  collaborative  behavior,  which must  free  up  individual  energies  within  its  teams,  which contribute to the development of collective intelligence.",

        "page_content": "TEC represents a significant change in corporate culture within  the  Group,  which  primarily  concerns  managerial culture : the aim is to establish, by default, the principle of trust and thus move from a vertical, traditional structure, to an open, learning organization, leaving the freedom of act at local management level in  the  75  countries where Saint-Gobain operates. It also responds to the underlying trends  affecting  the  world  in  which  the  Group  operates, and  in  particular  to  the  disintermediation  brought  about by  new  technologies,  which  makes  managerial  methods obsolete and promotes profound changes in the relationship  between  individuals  and  work.  Successive lockdowns,  the  advent  of  remote  working  and  the adaptation of working conditions at production sites have required  employees  to  increase  their  autonomy.  The evolution of work patterns has called for greater flexibility and adaptation. In this regard, the Covid-19 crisis served as a launching ramp to reshape the rules of management and interpersonal  relations.  In  this  sense,  the  TEC  approach represents a way of aligning Saint-Gobain's strategy with changes  in  the  lifestyles  and  expectations  of  its  various stakeholders (see section 1.1.3, p. 16),  as  well  as  a  way  of enhancing its brand as an employer.\n\nThe TEC culture also helps make the innovation process more efficient , and also helps to align it with client needs by  removing  barriers  between  countries,  business  lines (solutions for construction and solutions for industry) and functions  (for  example,  researchers,  marketing  specialists and technicians).\n\nTo implement this approach on the ground ,  the Group is relying increasingly on its training program (see section 2.3.2.C b, p. 81), as well as on approaches such as collective  and  individual  coaching,  made  accessible  to  a greater number of employees, or even the gradual roll-out of 360\u00b0  assessments,  which  are  accessible  to  all employees and were made routine in 2022 by the entire 'top  150'  of  the  organization.  Giving  and  receiving feedback  is  also  encouraged,  so  as  to  strengthen collaboration and trust, at Group level (for example via the annual  me@Saint-Gobain  survey),  at  individual  level  (by developing  the  capacity  to  ask  for  feedback  and  to provide  it),  in  project  management  (for  example  via  the Evolve collaborative  platform)  and  at  individual  level  (by developing the ability to request feedback and receive it).\n\nAmong the initiatives put in place to promote the spread of the TEC  culture throughout Saint-Gobain, two programs  are  deployed  via  the  \"Unicampus\"  program, combining courses and collaborative activities. The first is the virtual training session entitled 'Become a Saint -Gobain culture champion to serve strategy', accessible to all Group employees, and highly recommended for new recruits. The second, called 'Grow your  Impact  as  a  TEC  leader',  is  a  workshop  specifically dedicated to managers in charge of teams.\n\nA  toolkit  for  managers  and  their  teams  is  available  to those  who  wish  to  work  on  these  topics  as  a  team.  It includes  content,  articles,  videos  and  books  to  study  the notions  of  Trust,  Empowerment  and  Collaboration  in depth. For the third year in a row, the annual me@saintgobain survey (see section 3.5.3.D, p. 136) contains a TEC index composed of 10 questions, which is used to measure progress  on  a  collective  basis.  In  2023,  this  TEC  index stands at 84%. 80% of Group employees feel involved in setting their objectives, 80% have confidence in management  and  87%  recognize  that  their  manager promotes teamwork and collaboration.\n\nEach  manager  can  therefore  measure  the  TEC  index  for their  scope and draw up an improvement plan with their teams.\n\nA responsible and efficient Group\n\n## C - Developing human capital: recruiting, training and growing talent\n\n## Recruitment\n\nSaint -Gobain's development depends first and foremost on the quality  and  expertise  of  the  men  and  women  who make up the Group . This is reflected first and foremost by the  attention  paid  to  recruitment ,  aiming  to recruit  the best talents in all specialties , including engineers, digital & data scientists, sales and marketing staff, product managers,  supply  chain  and  sustainable  development specialists. Beyond  the  recruitment  process  and  the attention paid  to  its brand  as  an  employer,  it  is Saint -Gobain's  collective  ability  to  train,  nurture  and constantly develop these talents that will enable it to stand out.  With  digital  technology  and  refined  data  processing, career paths can be more easily individualized and the HR support policy customized (see section 2.3.2.C, p. 81).\n\n## b. Training\n\nTraining  provided  by  Saint -Gobain  must  guarantee  the employability  and  success  of  all  employees  throughout their working lives. The objective is to facilitate access to training through processes and offers that correspond to their needs and expectations.\n\nTraining is part of the Group's major transformations as it provides  support  for  employees  and  availability  for  the skills necessary for the success of operational teams.\n\nParticular  emphasis  is  placed  on  the  skills  that  are  the most  critical  for  the  future  of  the  Group  and  that  will therefore strengthen the employability of employees in the medium and long term.\n\nThe training policy is structured as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 To  support  cultural  transformation  and  leadership based  on  trust,  empowerment  and  collaboration,  in order  to  acquire  greater  operational  agility  and  to promote  new  ways  of  working,  offering  greater efficiency and  flexibility. This includes  managerial training and talent development;\n- \u00b7 Accelerate  the  digital  transformation  in  operations, business models and skills;\n- \u00b7 Foster growth and focus on clients: sales and marketing performance, product innovation, services and business models;\n- \u00b7 Ensure efficiency and operational excellence: industrial performance,  purchasing  and  supply  chain,  EHS,  and R&D;\n- \u00b7 Deploy mandatory training (compliance, ethics, cybersecurity, etc.) and programs dedicated to Saint -Gobain's major professional sectors (finance, HR, purchasing, marketing, etc.).\n\nAll programs are in digital or hybrid format (in-person and digital)  and  the  majority  of  in-person  programs  are regional  in  order  to  maximize  inclusion  for  all  our employees wherever they are in the world, and to reduce the number of trips and minimize our CO2 emissions and carbon footprint. The only global in-person programs are reserved for employees identified as having high potential.",

        "page_content": "A responsible and efficient Group\n\nThe  annual  employee  satisfaction  survey  measures  the perceived adequacy of the training offered with the needs for improving skills, the ease of access to the training offer and the personal feeling of being properly trained.\n\nThe level of satisfaction measured in 2023 was strong and improved compared with 2022:\n\n- \u00b7 90% of employees confirm that they are satisfied with their  training  ('I  feel  adequately  trained  to  do  my work') (2022: 90%);\n- \u00b7 81%  of  employees  are  satisfied  with  the  training  and development  proposals  ('I  have  opportunities  for learning and development within my company') (2022: 80%);\n- \u00b7 88%  of  employees  believe  they  have  improved  their knowledge and skills ('I feel I have improved my skills and abilities') (2022: 88%).\n\nThe \"Unicampus\" programs continued to be updated and enhanced  to  accelerate  skills  development  in  relation  to the  pillars  of  the  'Grow  &  Impact'  strategic  program. Training  programs  on  innovation,  agile  methodologies, Dthe  digital  &  data  analytics,  and  sustainability  are  now available  as  well  as  programs  related  to  the  TEC  culture, such as 'Grow your Impact as a TEC Leader' and 'Become a Saint -Gobain Culture Champion to Serve Strategy'.\n\nThe 'Climate Academy' to introduce all employees to the challenges of the ongoing climate emergency, supplemented by the climate fresk, in which nearly 34,000 employees have participated.  Available  on  the  e-learning platform,  short  Climate  Academy  modules  present  both the  risks  related  to  climate  change  and  the  actions  that everyone  can  take  to  deal  with  this  challenge.  For  the climate fresk, the Group now has 1,300 internal facilitators.\n\nA  new  cybersecurity  training  was  launched  and  89,712 people were trained in 2023.\n\nWith regard to training for the sectors (finance, purchasing,  communication,  HR,  etc.),  30  new  e-learning courses  have  been  launched,  including  a  program  on Saint-Gobain's  corporate  purpose  'making  the  world  a better  home',  a  program  on  Inclusive  Management,  and several programs on management control and finance for buyers.\n\n## New leadership\n\nThe  'Talent  Lab'  programs  are  continually  reviewed  in order  to  best  match  the  skills  required  to  support  and maintain the Group's strategy. They have been redesigned to help  participants  build  trust,  empowerment  and collaboration in their teams as well as their transformational leadership skills, essential to the Group's sustainable  growth.  These  programs  also  favor  the attraction and retention of talents.\n\nA new 'Welcome on Board' orientation program has been created for senior managers joining the Group. It quickly imparts  knowledge  of  the  Group  as  a  way  of  improving integration,  and  is  an  opportunity  to  meet  the  Group's senior executives. The  Meet  the  Group  orientation program for middle and more junior managers is handled by the regions.\n\n\u00cb\n\nIn  2023,  601  of  the  Group's  talents,  33%  of  whom  were women, took part in one of the Talent Lab programs.\n\nDeployment of a new 360-evaluation tool with debriefing and  coaching  is  ongoing,  allowing  managers  to  be assessed on their TEC behavior. This tool is available to all managers  and  used  in  the  Talent  Lab  programs.  In addition,  the  Group's  150  top  executives  underwent  this assessment in 2022.\n\nTo  supplement  these  programs  for  talents,  digital  tools and  training  programs  specific  to  this  new  managerial culture have been rolled out at Group and country level for all managers.\n\n## Digital transformation\n\nIn  2020, the support programs for teams and employees were reviewed and reorganized according to Saint -Gobain's targets and transformation objectives:\n\n- \u00b7 Supporting  people  to  better  understand  new  digital tools  and  improve  efficiency.  As  part  of  this,  a  new \"PowerBI\" program was created and deployed;\n- \u00b7 The  development  of  tools  in  operations,  in  particular the integration of new tools;\n- \u00b7 Digital culture, including the \"Data Analytics Academy\" program  launched  to  develop  and  anchor  the  skills required for data processing and their use in operations,  logistics  and  commercial  activities.  New data  analytics  programs  have  been  launched  to  raise awareness among managers and for the Supply Chain function;\n- \u00b7 The  new  Business  Models  and  anticipation  of  new technologies.\n\n## Growth and client focus\n\nThe  \"Unicampus\"  program  continues  to  improve  the sharing  and  circulation  of  knowledge  and  know-how throughout the organization. This program uses the camps format to provide training mostly involving the sharing of practices,  with  a  minority  component  of  theoretical conceptualization.  This  format  promotes  collaboration, networking  and  interactive  learning  methods.  It  enables the  dissemination  of  a  shared  culture  of  operational excellence focused on client needs and expectations. Thus, training  sessions  are  mainly  focused  on  marketing,  sales and service offering to clients (innovation and offers, Sales and  Marketing  performance,  Client  Experience,  digital marketing,  sustainable  construction,  etc.)  as  well  as innovation and research and development.\n\nThe \"Unicampus\" program quickly went virtual. More than 106  sessions  during  the  e-camps  were  held  in  2023, involving more than 1300 people.\n\n## Operational excellence\n\nThe  \"Unicampus\"  program  also  offers  many  trainings about  management  of  technical  skills  related  to  the Group's  business  lines  (Gypsum,  Insulation,  Mortars,  etc.) and  to  industrial  excellence  (WCM,  supply  chain\u2026).  The 'people development' pillar of the WCM program (see this chapter,  section  2.3.3.A,  p.  84)  helps  to  identify  and monitor key skills.",

        "page_content": "Training  programs  organized  by  technical  business  line ensure  the  management  and  updating  of  the  skills required to offer the clients high-performance, competitive and innovative products and services. These programs are generally  developed  and  implemented  by  training  teams organized  by  business  line:  glass,  gypsum,  insulation, mortars,  pipe,  etc.  The  Glass  Technical  Academy  thus incorporated  all  glass  manufacturing  training,  and  also technical  glass  transformation  training  for  construction and  automobile  applications.  Designed  and  delivered  by around 70 experts, the training sessions provide in-depth technical  content,  practical  exercises  and  site  visits.  This constitution of a center  of  excellence  around  the businesses  enables  the  transfer  of  knowledge,  sharing  of best  practices  and  the  alignment  of  methods  within  the business lines.\n\nSimilarly  to  manufacturing,  training  programs  are  set  up for  the  specific  distribution  business  lines  in  countries where the Group has sales outlets.\n\nIn addition, new programs related to product compliance and the supply chain were launched in 2021.\n\n## Offering solutions tailored to individual expectations\n\nPrograms  are  designed  and  implemented  to  promote adaptation to individual preferences. Combining classroom training,  blended  training,  e-learning  modules  or  camps, they enable the dissemination of the Group's policies and processes and the sharing of best practices. Saint -Gobain University  also  offers  individual  development  programs such as coaching and mentoring.\n\n## c. Employee development\n\nSaint -Gobain's  ambition  is  to  grow  the  skills  and  knowhow  of  its  employees  while  still  ensuring  excellence  in each  of  its  businesses,  but  also  to  be  an  employer  of reference, recognized for the richness of the career paths offered.  It  involves  taking  into  account  individual  wishes and the requirements of the organization, offering adapted developing paths, whether individual or collective, specific to  one  business  line  or  cross-functional.  Establishing  the TEC  culture  (Trust,  Empowerment,  Collaboration)  is  an important catalyst for the success of employee development.\n\n## Listening to employees individually\n\nMore  individually,  Saint -Gobain  has  introduced  an  annual interview procedure which makes it possible to ensure the regularity and quality of dialog with employees. Individual interviews are held at least once a year for management and are gradually being expanded to all employees.\n\nMultiple initiatives (trainings, 'Evolve' platform, etc.) have been  developed  to  increase  feedback  practice  in  the managerial or project management framework.\n\nFinally, the Group has developed, with the help of partners, a  360-degree  assessment  tool.  This  tool  is  available  on request to any manager and mandatory before participation in  any  Talent  Lab training courses (Group internal offering of leadership development training courses).\n\n## Mobility\n\nEvery  Saint -Gobain  employee,  no  matter  what  their position  in  the  company,  should  benefit  from  career enrichment. Their career path must be a positive marker, so  they  can  feel  they  are  ambassadors  for  the  Group. Promoting and enriching employees' professional mobility, whether  geographic,  functional  or  between  Saint -Gobain activities, is a priority for accelerating the Group's growth:\n\nA responsible and efficient Group\n\n- \u00b7 It is an essential way of attracting diversity, innovating, developing  the  individual  and  collective  skills  needed for  the  organizational  and  technological  requirements of the Group's activities;\n- \u00b7 This  also  enables  the  sharing  of  market  and  client knowledge,  the  comparison  of  different  experiences, the development  of  an  open  mindset  and  the enrichment of employees' careers;\n- \u00b7 Mobility should reconcile employees' professional development with the business's needs. Offering more career  development  opportunities  builds  employee loyalty and  intensifies synergies, generating  new solutions for clients.\n\nThe system deployed by Saint -Gobain to support mobility is  based  on  broad  communication  of  the  policy  and related  actions,  including  a  guide  to  support  HR  teams. Global  reporting  is  used  to  monitor  the  mobility  of managers through an HR Information System dedicated to them.\n\nAll employees are invited to consult the job offers that are made  and  to  apply  for  them.  The  new  online  platform 'Moov!' (replacing OpenJob) was developed and deployed in countries to meet this need. This platform is accessible on mobile devices for all employees.\n\nIn various Saint -Gobain entities, mobility committees bring together Human Resources managers to share job offers and exchange points of view about employees' development prospects. These mobility committees cover all employees  and  are  reinforced  for  managers.  The management  teams  also  encourage  employee  mobility and  include  applications  from  employees  from  other activities in their succession plans.\n\nIn  the  event  of  geographic  mobility,  the  Group  offers  all employees  support  for  themselves  and  their  families. Finally, within  the  scope  of  reorganization  projects, Saint -Gobain favors the conclusion of mobility agreements.\n\n## 'SG Talents' program\n\nThe 'Talent' element of the OPEN program is aimed at all employees to anticipate the Group's needs and support its strategy.  It  is  the  subject  of  a  specific  annual  progress update  meeting  with  the  members  of  the  Executive Committee.\n\nThe  'SG  Talents'  program  identifies  managers  with significant development potential or key skills. Defined at all  levels and in all Group business lines, it enables career plans  to  be  drawn  up,  encouraging  diversified  paths. Personal  reviews  and  succession  plans,  mentoring  and relations  with  the  Group's  target  schools  and  universities all feed  into  and  reinforce  this  measure.  A  specific program has also been designed to support and develop experts within the Group.\n\nAs part of the drive to digitize human resources processes, a  project  using  machine  learning  applied  to  the  'SG Talents'  program has been developed. In the first phase, the  use  of  Big  Data  made  it  possible  to  verify  that  the selection of talents was adapted to the defined criteria and that  the  paths  of  the  identified  talents  benefited  from additional  resources  (part  of  mobility,  training,  etc.).  The second  phase  is  more  focused  on  complementary elements  to  the  program:  the  search  for  talent  not identified  by  the  traditional  process,  improving  retention or a focus on soft skills research.",

In  2022, the  Group  rolled  out  its  new  employer  brand  promise, notably  through  its  communication:  'Innovate  for  a  more sustainable world. Think big, act locally. Bring out the best of your personality. Develop your career through shared trust.'\n\nSpecific  programs  for  young  talent  coordinated  at  the local  level  are  being  developed  in  Germany,  Brazil,  the United States, India, China and the Nordic countries.\n\nThe  implementation  of  the  'Transform  &  Grow'  program required a large review of management positions at central and  local  level.  The  principles  applied  in  the  'Talents' component  of  the  OPEN  program  identified  managers with the most suitable profiles and organized their mobility in a way that has proven to be particularly active.\n\nAfter  the  year  2021  that  saw  the  consolidation  of  the country/cluster  organizations  (despite  the  constraints related to Covid-19 and its successive variants), the Group returned to the manager mobility level of previous years.\n\nThe  definition  of  'Grow  &  Impact',  the  Group's  new Strategic Plan (2021-2025), has identified as one of its six priorities,  'to  have  the  best  teams  in  a  diverse  and inclusive work environment'.\n\nThe definition  of  the  Group's  corporate  purpose,  like  the definition  of  its  'zero-carbon'  roadmap,  is  a  force  of attraction for young talents, who  are particularly demanding  with  regard  to  the  sustainable  dimension  of Saint -Gobain's  activities.  They  both  constitute  one  of  the foundations of the Group's employer promise.\n\n## 2.3.3 OPERATIONAL AND INDUSTRIAL EXCELLENCE PROGRAM\n\nWhile  the  sites are directly managed  by  country organizations,  central  coordination  is  ensured  to  deploy best practices, accelerate the implementation of technical innovation and optimize the performance of the sites. The Technology and Industrial Performance Department coordinates the operational excellence programs.\n\n## A - WCM program\n\nSaint -Gobain's World Class Manufacturing (WCM) program combines standardization of methods, tools and best practices with the modularity required to adapt to a wide  variety  of  industrial  processes  and  site  sizes.  It  is based on continuous performance improvement methods such as Lean, Six Sigma, TPM  (Total Productive Maintenance),  or  5S.  This  program  defines  the  logic,  the objective  of  rigor,  and  the  actions  to  achieve  continuous improvements  in  terms  of  quality,  performance  and sustainability  by  integrating  a  high  level  of  service  and client satisfaction.\n\nThe  WCM  program  is  based  on  certification  procedures such as ISO 9001 for quality, ISO 14001 and 50001 for the environment, ILO OSH 2001 and ISO 45001 for health and safety.  Its  management,  the  monitoring  of  its  execution and the improvement of the performance of the sites are managed  across  the  businesses  in  coordination  with  the departments of the sites.\n\nThe deployment of the WCM program at a site is adapted to  its  priorities,  size,  strengths  and  weaknesses  and  its objectives in terms  of  financial and  environmental performance, quality and client satisfaction. Thus, each site establishes its own  roadmap,  in accordance with international  guidelines,  standards  specific  to  its  business line,  the  expectations  of  its  clients  and  the  improvement objectives set. A WCM network of expertise has been set up  to  enable  better  dissemination  of  the  program,  the optimization  of  resources  by  country,  region  or  business line,  as  well  as  the  sharing  of  expertise  on  each  of  the program  pillars.  A  central  team  heads  up  the  WCM network, trains the teams, creates and applies the program standards,  circulates  the  tools  and  provides  site-specific assistance on request.\n\n\u00cb\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSaint -Gobain's  WCM  program  is  based  on  eight  pillars, each one representing an area of excellence.\n\nThe foundations of the program define the methods and tools:\n\n- \u00b7 Analyzing losses to determine a prioritization of actions;\n- \u00b7 Resolving  problems  with  logic,  rigor  and  precision  for lasting improvement;\n- \u00b7 Involving  and  engaging  employees  in  a  proactive approach;\n- \u00b7 Improving standards to make progress easier to deploy and more robust over time.\n\nAchieving  industrial  excellence  is  a  demanding  process that requires gradual, methodical and constant implementation.  To  support  the  sites  in  this  process, training programs are rolled out during sessions led either by the central teams or by local trainers. These trainers are trained  and  certified  by  the  central  team.  In  2023,  more than 1,523 employees were trained.",

Stringency  levels  have  been  established  to  set principles shared by the entire organization. Each of these requirement levels matches both a performance objective set  by  the  business  and  a  maturity  milestone  in  the program. Audits verify the robustness of the implemented actions and the sustainability of the results obtained. As of the end of 2023, 192 sites were certified Bronze, 59 Silver and five Gold.\n\nThe  WCM  program  delivers  a  significant  reduction  in production costs while minimizing risks in terms of health, safety,  environmental  and  industrial  risks.  The  'Quality', 'Industrial performance' and 'Environment' pillars contribute significantly to reducing Saint -Gobain's environmental footprint by reducing production waste and water  consumption  and  by  improving  energy  efficiency. The WCM program and its extension to the supply chain represent  a  change  of  culture  and  management  system, with the aim of bringing a high level of service to clients, better  competitiveness  and  greater  efficiency,  while continuously improving the health and safety of all Group employees  and  those  of  its  partners.  It  fosters  and promotes  employee  commitment  and  mobility.  Finally,  it contributes to the success of the digital transformation of plants  and  to  the  adoption  of  its  methods  and  tools  by user.\n\nThe  methods  developed  in  the  'People  Development' pillar make it possible to manage Saint -Gobain's technical skills  by  adapting  training  programs,  employee  career paths and, if necessary, the search for external skills. This pillar  is  also  essential  to  strengthen  the  TEC  culture  (see section 2.3.2.B , p. 80).\n\n## B - Managing the environment, health and safety of employees\n\nIn  addition  to  the  environmental  impact  management activities and those related to health and safety integrated into  the  'environment'  and  'health  and  safety'  pillars  of the WCM  program  (see  section 2.3.3.B, p. 85), Saint -Gobain's  environmental,  health  and  safety  policy  is applied  to  all  its  sites.  Its  deployment  is  based  on  a reference  framework  that  describes  the  environmental, health,  and  safety  management  system  and  explains  the risk identification and management approach (see section 2.3.3.B, p. 85). This management system is based on ISO or equivalent  certification  requirements,  in  particular  ISO 14001 and ISO 45001.\n\nEach  site  has  tools  to  facilitate  continuous  performance improvement by reducing negative impacts and anticipating risks:\n\n- \u00b7 thematic  policies  accompanied  by  standards  and application guides;\n- \u00b7 thematic training and webinars on the main EHS issues;\n- \u00b7 tools for monitoring action plans and reporting to steer performance improvement.\n\nA  support  team  of  experts,  in  the  regions  and  at  the central level, support the approach of the sites.\n\nA responsible and efficient Group\n\nAudits of the environmental, health, and safety management  system  are  conducted  by  the  functional department concerned. These audits are  conducted  as  a priority  at  sites  which  do  not  have  an  ISO  or  equivalent certification.  In  addition  to  these  audits,  a  version  of  the audit  methodology  has  been  developed  for  smaller  sites for which ISO certification is less suitable.\n\nLastly, a training matrix defines the training on managing environmental,  health,  and  safety  risks  for  the  teams according to the position held. It is a particularly relevant tool to use to define employee training courses.\n\nThis  approach  is  also  based  on  the  principle  of  sharing best  practices  between  sites.  EHS  Awards  have  been organized for many years. Each site can present a recently implemented  innovation  that  has  reduced  the  site's environmental footprint or improved health and safety. In 2023,  the  33rd  'EHS  Awards'  received  66  project nominations  that  were  assessed  by  an  international  jury, made  up  of  Saint-Gobain  employees  and  external  EHS experts.  Four  main  criteria  are  taken  into  account:  the scale  and  sustainability  of  risk  reduction;  the  scope  for extending  initiatives to other sites; the degree  of involvement  of  employees  in  implementation;  and  the innovative nature of the actions undertaken.\n\nOn October 10, 2023, the winners selected by the jury took part in the award ceremony, which took place in the Tour Saint-Gobain and was broadcast to all the Group's sites. 15 winners were honored for their outstanding contributions to  a  safer,  healthier  and  more  environmentally  friendly world.\n\n## a. Protecting the health and safety of employees\n\nThe health and safety of employees are absolute priorities, and  Saint -Gobain  makes  them  central  to  its  corporate culture. It is important for everyone to participate in their own health and safety, and those of all of their colleagues.\n\n## Employees health\n\nIn terms of health and well-being, Saint -Gobain adopted a policy  in  2013  and  updated  it  early  2022.  It  sets  out  the guidelines  for  action  to  protect  the  health  and  promote the well-being of its employees, clients and suppliers, users of its products, as well as residents living near its sites. The action plans focused  on  external  stakeholders  are described in section 3.5, p. 131.\n\nTo ensure the same level of protection and medical care for all its employees worldwide, the Group has established mandatory  standards,  medical  monitoring  protocols  and recommendations for health and industrial hygiene. They are  supplemented  by  specific  standards  for  certain activities.\n\nAll  Saint -Gobain  sites  worldwide  must  implement  the health  policy.  The  actions  implemented  by  each  site  are prioritized on the basis of risk assessments in accordance with the 'risk assessment and control' standard. A Health Indicator  for  Occupational  Exposure  (HICE)  is  monitored at  Group  level,  allowing  performance  to  be  monitored  in terms  of  the  risks  of  exposure  to  noise  and  chemical agents.  The  management  of  employee  health  risks  is described in section 3.3.2.B, p. 115.",

        "page_content": "A responsible and efficient Group\n\nThe arrangement of workstations and their adaptation in case of limitation of the employee's working capacities are also  central  points  of  implementation  of  the  policy.  In France, for example, a detailed guide has been published to help employees with limited working capacity to remain in  employment with the Group. Preventive programs and programs  to  promote  health  and  well-being,  including access to healthcare and social protection for employees and  their  families  (see  section  3.2.3.A,  p.  102)  are implemented.\n\nThe recommendations concerning the organization of first aid  for  cardiac  arrest  and  the  equipment  of  the  entities with automatic external defibrillators were communicated.\n\n## Well-being at work\n\nSaint-Gobain attaches fundamental importance to physical health but also to the mental health of its employees, as outlined  in  the  Group's  new  health  policy.  The  Mental WellBeing  (MWB)  program  was  rolled  out  to  all  Group managers and concerns all employees. The program takes the form of an interactive app and was designed to clarify the approach to preventing mental health issues and help managers  optimize  the  psychological  well-being  of  their teams. Each manager can build a tailored program for his or  her  team,  monitor  it  and  exchange  it  with  other managers  or  share  relevant  best  practices  drawn  from their experience. There are six action areas: management practices, change management, interpersonal environment,  physical  working  environment,  work/life balance and personal well-being skills.\n\nThis  interactive  tool  is  above  all  aimed  at  primary prevention practices and proposes best practices, collects those  identified  by  teams  worldwide  and  provides  key information so that each team can implement them. Thus, specific  programs  can  be  initiated  locally  by  linking specific  issues  and  proposals  for  concrete  actions  to improve well-being at work. This concept was designed on the  impetus  of  the  Medical  and  Workplace  Health Department and a multicultural working group, with a very diverse  range  of  profiles  (HR,  EHS,  communication,  site officers, etc.) and with the involvement of social partners.\n\nThis approach is linked to the 'human resources' pillar of the WCM excellence program (see section 2.3.3.A, p. 84). It is also embedded in the Saint-Gobain HR process: in the training    provided  by  the  school  of  management,  the individual  annual  reviews  for  managers'  forms,  or  in  the specific  questions  in  the  yearly  survey  to  measure employee  engagement.  A  MWB  indicator  is  produced annually from this survey, followed by documented action plans.\n\nIn  2023,  the  Medical  and  Workplace  Health  Department and  Training department  have  designed  an  easily accessible e-learning course: the Mental Health Academy. It  consists  of  11  short,  independent  videos.  They  cover topics such as the role of the manager and the employee, detection, measurement and factors in psychological well-\n\n\u00cb\n\nbeing,  action  plans,  the  challenges  and  the  Group's ambition. They show the commitment of Top Management and  aim  to  inspire  awareness  among  all  employees, enabling them to go further and take action for their own mental  health,  and  that  of  others!  Saint-Gobain  has  a responsibility  to  create  a  supportive  work  environment, where early warning signs of mental health problems can be detected, and to provide the resources to respond. The Mental  Health  Academy  encourages  employees  to  take care  of  themselves,  and  managers  to  take  care  of  their teams by adopting good practices and teaching them to recognize the early signs of trouble.\n\nGenerally  speaking,  the  Group  wishes  to  create  a motivating and engaging work environment, respectful of the  work/life  balance  for  all  employees.  As  such,  flexible working and working from home are encouraged.\n\nThis platform is also a source of information on the general workplace  mental  health  approach  in  four  fundamental stages: training, awareness-raising, assessment, workplace best  practices,  support  for  people  in  hardship  and monitoring of indicators and action plans.\n\nThis individual care can be provided by on-site psychologists,  specialized  external  firms,  or  the  in-house medical teams.\n\n## Safety\n\nSaint -Gobain  ensures  that  all  employees  on  its  sites, including  temporary  workers  and  subcontractors,  have safe working conditions and environments by identifying, reducing and controlling risks.\n\nAt  the  highest  level,  the  management  has  demonstrated its  involvement in the development of a culture of safety within  the  Group.  All  meetings  of  the  Board  of  Directors and the Executive Committee include a safety performance review. Operational management is responsible  everywhere  and  guarantees  all  aspects  of safety: objectives, action plans and performance measurement.  To  underline  this  commitment,  part  of managers'  annual  variable  compensation  is  based  on actions and results in the area of safety. The performance of  safety  inspections  and  the  application  of  safety standards are also considered.\n\nTo  build  on  this  result  and  sustain  the  overall  effort,  the TRAR  indicator  has  been  included  in  the  criteria  for  the long-term compensation plan since 2017 (see section 5.2.4, p. 240).\n\nThis  approach  affects  all  Saint -Gobain's  businesses  and endeavors  to  place  safety  at  the  heart  of  the  Group's corporate culture. Reporting and processing are as follows for  accidents  with  and  without  lost  time.  Other  events, such as first aid, near misses and dangerous situations, are handled  locally  (reporting,  analysis  of  causes,  archiving, consolidation and communication).",

Environmental managers coordinate this process.\n\nSaint-Gobain's \"Energy, atmospheric emissions and climate  change\"  policy  aims  to  reduce  greenhouse  gas emissions,  both  by  cutting  energy  consumption  and  by switching  to  low-carbon  energy  sources  for  industrial processes,  infrastructure  and  logistics  at  all  sites.  To coordinate  actions  to  reduce  energy  consumption  and greenhouse  gas  emissions  (scope  1  and  2),  energy  and climate  managers  have  been  appointed  for  the  most energy-intensive  industrial  processes.  Their  mission  is  to analyze  performance  gaps  in  relation  to  the  best performers,  and  to  share  best  practices  that  can  be replicated across all sites.\n\nThe  Group  encourages  energy  audits  at  its  sites  and  is implementing  an  energy  management  system  based  on ISO 50001 certification. By the end of 2023, 155 sites will be ISO 50001 certified, representing 23.4% of Saint -Gobain's annual energy consumption. In addition, the Group  has  developed  an  energy  audit  approach  for industrial  facilities,  enabling  it  to  identify  solutions  for improving  energy  efficiency,  notably  through  better insulation. This tool, which is currently being deployed, will help  identify  and  implement  measures  to  reduce  energy consumption at sites, as well as the resulting emissions.\n\nEach  site,  in  a  manner  commensurate  with  its  impact, defines  progress  targets  and  monitoring  procedures  for energy  management  and  atmospheric  emissions,  taking into account process comparisons between different sites.\n\nSome  of  the  Group's  plants,  mainly  glass  furnaces  and pipeline  production  sites,  emit  substances  other  than\n\n\u00cb\n\ncarbon  emissions,  that  contribute  to  the  acidification  of environments  such  as  sulfur  dioxide  (SO2)  or  nitrogen oxides (NOx). The primary measures introduced to reduce sulfur  dioxide  emissions  include  the  reduction  in  energy consumption  and  the  use  of  fuels  with  a  low  sulfur content. Primary measures to optimize processes, particularly  combustion,  make  it  possible  to  reduce  N0x emissions  at  source.  In  addition  to  these  primary measures,  equipment  for  the  secondary  treatment  of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides is also installed.\n\nSome  industrial  sites  are  affected  by  Volatile  Organic Compound (VOC) emissions as a result of their industrial process. On-site monitoring is based on measurements as needed. The aim is to check that emissions are below the limits set by the environmental operation permit; as such, it  is  heavily dependent on the local context. Optimization of raw  materials  can  reduce  VOC  emissions,  while secondary  measures  through  a  decontamination  unit  are implemented when necessary.\n\n## Water management\n\nSaint -Gobain's Water policy ('Water policy') confirms the desire  to  reduce  the  impacts  of  the  Group's  activities  on water resources as much as possible, whether in terms of water  intake  or  discharge.  The  long-term  objective  is  to withdraw as little  water  as  possible  and  to  aim  for  'zero discharge' of industrial water in liquid form, while avoiding generating  new  impacts  for  other  natural  environments and/or  for  other  stakeholders.  Saint -Gobain  does  its utmost to:\n\n- \u00b7 reduce water withdrawals from the natural environment and optimize processes to minimize water consumption;\n- \u00b7 reuse 'process' water whenever possible;",

        "page_content": "- \u00b7 recycle on-site or off-site with appropriate treatments;\n- \u00b7 not degrade water quality by reducing and controlling discharges into the natural environment and preventing any accidental pollution;\n- \u00b7 not  compete  with  local  populations  for  access  to drinking water.\n\nThe  'Focus  Sites'  program  consists  of  supporting  sites which  contribute  to  80%  of  the  Group's  environmental indicator. In 2023, 44 sites contributed 80%  of Saint -Gobain's  water  discharges  and  114  sites  for  80%  of the samples. These focus sites drew up a short-, medium-, and long-term action plan to reduce their impact.\n\nWhen the  site  is  located  in  a  zone  of  high  or  very  high water  stress,  specific  measures  are  taken  to  limit  water withdrawals and discharges. Rainwater harvesting measures  to  optimize  available  water  resources  are  also studied.\n\n## Waste management and optimization of resource use\n\nSaint-Gobain  has  implemented  a  policy  of  responsible resource management. The main axes for the deployment of this policy are :\n\n- \u00b7 incorporate  as  much  reused,  recycled  or  biobased content as possible in its products;\n- \u00b7 generate  a  minimum  of  production  residues,  and  for those that remain, valorize them internally or externally.\n\nThe industrial sites are working to reduce the quantities of waste  generated  in  accordance  with  the  three  Rs hierarchy:  Reduce,  Reuse  and  Recycle.  Incineration  and landfilling  should  be  reduced  until  they  are  eliminated. Sites  seek  to  reuse  production  residues  in  their  own industrial processes.\n\nSome  of  the  waste  generated  during  the  production  of mineral  wools  is  reprocessed  before  being  recovered externally  as  a  secondary  raw  material  for  the  roofing industry  or  for  certain  manufacturers  that  manufacture acoustic ceilings. The Group is also involved in the creation of  recycling  networks  with  the  help  of  external  local partners. Progress in the reduction and recycling of waste made  at  certain  Group  sites  shows  that  'zero  nonrecovered waste' is an achievable ambition.\n\nA responsible and efficient Group\n\nThe  main  focuses  for  the  deployment  of  this  policy  are incorporating  as  much  reused,  recycled  or  bio-sourced content  into  its  products  as  possible,  generating  as  little production  waste  as  possible,  and  recovering  that  which remains internally or externally.\n\nThe  procedures  for  collecting  end-of-life  products  are described in section 3.4.3.C, p. 129.\n\nThis  may  involve  investing  in  reprocessing  plants  and adapting their industrial processes.\n\n## Biodiversity and land use\n\nSaint -Gobain is  committed to protecting biodiversity , in particularly  at  its  high-impact  sites  or  in  areas  with remarkable biodiversity. Thanks to the experience acquired in the field of extraction activities, the Group now has strong internal expertise in the area; it has adopted a biodiversity policy, the aim of which is to preserve, restore, enhance  and  boost  biodiversity,  and  to  this  end  to encourage the involvement of all relevant stakeholders.\n\nOut of the 100 underground or surface quarries operated by  the  Group  worldwide,  the  vast  majority  are  for  the production  of  gypsum  (75,  or  75  %).  A  charter  for  the environment and biodiversity in all Saint -Gobain's quarries and  mines  was  published  in  2019,  capitalizing  on  the experience  acquired  over  many  years  in  gypsum.  The Group's quarries are operated and then restored with the aim of preserving the environment in accordance with the local  rules.  During  the  operating  and  restoration  period, the  effects  on  residents  and  on  the  environment  are reduced  as  much  as  possible:  visual  impact,  dust,  noise and vibration, consequences to road traffic and repercussions on the local natural environments. In 2023, 38 % of Saint -Gobain priority sites, around three quarters of  which  are  active  quarries,  already  had  a  biodiversity management plan analyzed centrally. 'Biodiversity representatives'  have  been  appointed  at  each  of  the priority sites.\n\nA catalog of best practices in the area of biodiversity was created  this  year  to  facilitate  the  implementation  of biodiversity actions in the Group's sites.\n\n## 2.3.4 RESPOND TO CLIENT EXPECTATIONS\n\n## A - A client-centric innovation process\n\nThe environment in which Saint-Gobain operates is a rapidly changing world, subject to fundamental trends on a global scale,  massively  digitized,  and  where  there  are  very  high expectations in terms of energy sobriety, the fight against climate change and limiting the use of natural resources, as well  as  productivity  to  deal  with  a  growing  shortage  of labor specialized in construction and renovation. In essence, innovation  is  a  non-linear  process,  which  requires  time  to ask the right questions before converging  towards solutions.  To  meet  customer  needs,  anticipate  market trends  and  integrate  innovation  into  its  industrial  and trading  activities,  the  Group's  innovation  strategy  focuses on four key areas, all centered on the customer:\n\n- \u00b7 processes  and  solutions  for  the  transition  to  carbon neutrality;\n- \u00b7 lightweight  construction  systems  for  performance  and well-being;\n- \u00b7 solutions  to  reduce  the  use  of  non-renewable  natural resources;\n- \u00b7 materials and solutions for new markets.\n\nThe  collective  approach  to  innovation  applies  both internally  and  more  broadly,  including  Saint-Gobain's stakeholders outside the organization, primarily among its customers.  This  approach  to  innovation,  geared  to  the outside of the organization, leads to open and crossfunctional  methods,  involving  all  of  the  Group's teams.  The  main  objective  is  to  better  understand  the specific expectations of customers in each of the Group's markets,  in  order  to  identify  use  cases  and  situations where Saint-Gobain will bring value, reduce time to market and  optimize  return  on  investment.  For  architects  and engineers, this means technical support, ease of collaboration,  and  ease  of  testing  new  products  and solutions;  for  craftsmen  and  building  contractors,  this involves  the  supply  of  products  and  materials,  access  to distribution sites, ease of installation, advice on installation, and  project  management  support;  for  developers,  this  is the  total  cost  of  ownership,  on-time  delivery,  and  advice",

'Design  thinking' approaches  and  user  experience  in  the  development  of new products, systems and services are also deployed in the  various  R&D  centers.  For  the  Group's  industrial customers, Saint-Gobain's High Performance Solutions are particularly  concerned  by  this  approach.  The  Group's distribution  activities    are  also  a  valuable  tool  for developing  a  more  detailed  knowledge  of  the  market needs,  owing  to  the  proximity  with  the  customers  that they make possible.\n\nAs a result,  the  R&D  teams  are  able  to  run  scenarios  for the  use  of  different  prototypes  and  to  evaluate,  modify and  propose  solutions  that  meet  the  expectations  of customers  in  the  mobility  or  construction  industry markets. Teams of building science specialists, present in the various R&D centers around the world, are working to improve comfort continuously for end users and the ease of installation for craftsmen, as well as to reduce total cost of ownership for building owners.\n\nInnovation should not be the preserve of the Research & Development and Marketing departments.  Saint-Gobain is committed  to  developing  a  culture of innovation. Innovation  requires  a  deliberately  collective  approach. Innovation  is  always  born  from  a  team,  different  people coming together, chance and serendipity; it presupposes a gathering of forces, different points of view. It also benefits from failures, which enable progress on the condition that their  teams  keep  the  right  state  of  mind.  Being  openminded and thinking outside the box, taking original paths, questioning  practices  inherited  from  the  past  to  suggest and experiment with new ones: these are some of the skills exploited by all Saint-Gobain's employees.\n\nIn  terms  of  operational  management,  this  assumes  that Saint-Gobain adapts its organization and methods in order to  create  conditions  for  creativity,  encourage  empathy with customers to spread co-development, give its space to  divergent  thinking,  spread  agile  methods,  tolerate failure  -  hence  the  'Grow  from  failure'  training  program available  on  the  Boost  platform  -  as  well  as  to  promote open  innovation.  Among  the  initiatives  put  in  place,  the Group  has  rolled  out  Innovation  Catalysts,  committed employees,  trained  in  the  mindset,  methodology  and innovation  tools,  having  developed  specific  skills  to  put them  into  practice  effectively,  and  who  support  their colleagues  in  the  implementation  of  their  innovation projects, both internally and externally.\n\n\u00cb\n\nMore  generally,  it  involves  providing  all  employees  with information and tools to innovate, thereby developing new skills, and acquiring, mastering and disseminating appropriate methodologies internally. The central objective  is  to  foster  an  innovative  mindset.  It  is  about cultivating curiosity and empathy with customers and the courage to challenge achievements and assumptions. The deployment  of  the  TEC  (Trust,  Empowerment  and Collaboration)  managerial  approach  (see  section  2.3.2..B, p.  80)  facilitates  the  spread  of  this  culture  of  innovation. The  aim  is  also  to  build  diverse  teams,  which  are  in  a position  to  seek  solutions,  design  prototypes  and  judge the applicability and viability of the solutions conceived, at all  times.  Initially  developed  for  the  High  Performance Solutions  (HPS)  scope,  the  Saint-Gobain  Innovation  Hub exchange,  mutual  assistance  and  resources  platform  is gradually  expanding  to  offer  the  entire  Group  the necessary  training  and  tools  to  bring  innovation  projects to  a  successful  conclusion.  In  2023,  a  program  to  get  all employees  on  board  was  rolled  out:  \"be  open,  be  bold, take  up  the  challenge\".    This  program  was  accompanied by  the  publication  of  an  innovation  handbook  shared  on the exchange platform. This is a comprehensive guide to innovation  methods,  concepts  and  best  practices.  It  is designed to help individual employees and teams unleash their innovative potential.\n\nCreating  more  value  for  its  customers,  strengthening  its solutions  offering,  taking  full  advantage  of  its  local  and global  presence  and  expertise,  and  reducing  time-tomarket:  these  are  the  objectives  to  which  Saint-Gobain's teams are committed.\n\n## B -  Client satisfaction\n\nKnowledge  of  current  and  future  market  expectations  is essential  in  order  to  achieve  Saint -Gobain's medium- and long-term  targets.  For  this  reason,  the  satisfaction  of  its clients is a priority for the Group, whose objective is to be an organization focused on their expectations.\n\nTo measure client satisfaction, several practices have been extended to all Group activities:\n\n- \u00b7 Firstly,  a  short  questionnaire  is  sent  to  all  clients  and potential  clients,  both  direct  and  indirect,  regularly  in order  to  identify  the  main  points  of  satisfaction  and dissatisfaction,  and  to  determine  the  net  promoter score,  the  only  measure  common  to  all;  this  refined measure will eventually make all customers the Group's primary influencers;\n- \u00b7 Secondly, a more rigorous and responsive measurement  of  compliance  and  punctuality  since these  two  parameters  are  the  two  most  frequent sources of dissatisfaction in the customer reviews: first and  foremost,  clients  demand  that  their  suppliers' promises be kept.\n\nThus, client satisfaction measurements are carried out on a regular basis for all activities.",

        "page_content": "In  the  field,  brands  are  increasingly  collecting  feedback from clients (defined as any person having an influence on the purchasing decision) on a relationship and transactional  level,  with  the  dissemination,  internally  and across functions, of best practice in the area. This data is cross-referenced  with  the  context  of  the  relationship,  as well  as  with  the  type  of  clients,  in  order  to  assess  the degree of satisfaction throughout their journey, i.e., across the  entire  chain  of  interactions  between  them  and  the Group's brands. In this context, the satisfaction questionnaires  already  implemented  have  shown  that compliance and punctuality are the most frequently cited negative  points.  Every  piece  of  customer  feedback  is useful  in  improving  the  quality  of  our  performance  in concrete, operational ways.\n\nOne  of  the  Group's  areas  of  excellence  and  progress  is training  in  order  to  build  a  growing  community  of  client experience experts. Each year, more than 200 people are trained  in  client  experience  methods  and  concepts through the \"Unicampus\" program. In addition, a platform called  'Pulse'  has  been  created  to  centralize  and  make available to Saint -Gobain countries and entities methodologies and tools for managing  the  client experience,  such  as  'personas',  i.e.,  the  definition  of groups  of  clients  whose  behaviors  and  preferences  are merged  into  a  single  predictive  model  and  interview guides to encourage each employee to develop a culture of customer feedback.\n\nIn addition to the measurement of satisfaction itself, all of these  systems  create  the  basis  for  a  co-development approach;  on  the  basis  of  client  opinions,  a  shared innovation process can be put in place.\n\nA responsible and efficient Group",

        "page_content": "CSR Strategy\n\n## 3.1 CSR STRATEGY\n\n## 3.1.1 EMBEDDING CSR AT THE HEART OF THE BUSINESS MODEL\n\nFor  Saint -Gobain,  sustainable  growth  is  conceived  within its  ecosystem,  in  other  words,  taking  into  account  the interests of all its stakeholders. It is therefore a question of pursuing  a  development  trajectory  that  integrates  both the financial performance and shareholder value objectives as well as the Group's Corporate Social Responsibility.\n\nSaint-Gobain has a perfect alignment between  its corporate purpose - Making the world a better home -, its vision - to be the leader in sustainable construction - and its strategic plan - \"Grow & Impact\".\n\nStakeholders' expectations and the impact of the Group's activities (see section 1.3.2, p. 35) are thus translated into CSR  challenges  directly  integrated  into  the  Group's strategy.  The  aim  is  to  contribute  to  three  long-term ambitions:\n\n- \u00b7 'a decarbonated home,' encompassing all the initiatives implemented  for  the  Group's  contribution  to  the decarbonization  of  economies  and  reducing  global carbon emissions on a trajectory aligned with the Paris agreement;\n- \u00b7 'more performance with less' represents actions taken in favor of an economy that uses fewer resources, raw materials or water, avoiding waste throughout the value chain  of  Saint-Gobain's  activities  and  promoting  reuse or recycling;\n- \u00b7 'a better living for all,' aiming to create a safe, engaging working  environment  for  Group  employees  and  those of  its  partners  operating  in  its  value  chain  and  to contribute  to  the  development  of  local  communities, based on our code of ethics: the Principles of Conduct and Action.\n\nFor  each  of  these  three  ambitions,  Saint-Gobain  is deploying action plans which aim to :\n\n- \u00b7 maximize impact through high-performance, sustainable solutions that deliver benefits to stakeholders  in  terms  of  environmental  impact,  health and well-being;\n- \u00b7 minimize  the  environmental  and  social  footprint  of  its activities  across  its  value  chain  and  with  communities potentially affected.\n\nInternal  and  external  stakeholders  are  involved  in  these action plans as part of an ongoing dialog at both country organization  and  Group  support  function  levels  (see section 1.3.2, p. 35).\n\nSaint-Gobain's  CSR  strategy  has  been  presented  to  and approved  by  the  Board  of  Directors  and  its  CSR Committee.\n\n## 3.1.2 MAXIMIZING THE GROUP'S IMPACT AND MINIMIZING ITS FOOTPRINT\n\nSaint-Gobain's  policies  and  programs  are  not  limited  to management  of potential risks and environmental footprint, but also integrate benefits for stakeholders.\n\nThis  is  why  the  Group  has  made  strong  environmental commitments, such as the pledge to fight climate change signed  in  September  2019,  or  the  commitment  to  the United  Nations'  Sustainable  Development  Goals,  Foward Faster,  signed  during  Climate  Week  in  New  York  in September 2023.\n\nSaint-Gobain relies on its Code of Ethics, the Principles of Conduct and Action, its responsible practices (see section 2.3, p. 78) and the values shared with its partners to make decisions that maximize impact and minimize the footprint on the environment, human beings and local communities, including those living near the Group's sites.\n\nThe  Group's  policies,  the  programs  and  action  plans integrate  the  interests  of  stakeholders,  as  in  the  health policy,  the  environmental  policies  or  the  philanthropic programs  such  as  \"Build  change\"  or  the  Saint-Gobain Foundation.\n\nThe  \"Solutions  for  Growth\"  program  (see  section  3.2.3.C, p.  104)  is  at  the  heart  of  Saint-Gobain's  strategy  of maximizing  impact.  Its  aim  is  to  develop  solutions  that bring  benefits  to  all  stakeholders,  in  particular  for customers, right through to the end user.\n\nReducing  the  environmental  footprint  of  its  operations, managing its value chain responsibly and deploying its HR policy are the pillars of the Group's objective of minimizing the footprint of its operations.\n\nMedium and long-term  objectives  have  been  defined  for the main challenges. A performance monitoring dashboard is updated annually and published in section 4.2.1, p. 152.",

At each stage of this value chain, impacts, risks and opportunities are identified. Measures to control risks and develop opportunities are implemented with the stakeholders impacted.\n\nThe value chain diagram is described in section 1.1.3, p. 20.\n\n## 3.2.1 SUPPLY CHAIN AND LOGISTICS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPurchasing meets the needs of the Group's manufacturing and  distribution activities. Although  the  purchasing functions are based on shared policies and on a common base,  especially  the  implementation  of  the  Responsible Purchasing policy (see section 3.2.1.A, p. 106), they do not operate at the same level of the Saint -Gobain value chain:\n\n- \u00b7 Non-trade purchases: these relate to purchases upstream  of  the  production  stage  (raw  materials, energy,  chemicals,  components,  etc.),  purchases  of equipment  used  for  production  (machinery,  civil engineering,  etc.),  all  logistics  expenses,  as  well  as purchases  of  support  functions  (IT,  marketing,  human resources, environment, health and safety, communication, finance, audit, etc.);\n- \u00b7 Trade purchases: downstream  purchases  of  the production  to  ensure  the  offerings  of  the  Group's distribution brands.\n\nSaint -Gobain's purchasing policy favors the establishment of medium- and long-term contracts and partnerships with its suppliers.\n\nThe supply chain of industrial sites is mostly local. Under 4%  of  a  region's  purchases  are  made  outside  its geographical  region.  This  implies  the  management  of  a large number of suppliers. More than 200,000 companies supply the sites, of which about 21,210 account for 90% of Group  purchases.  Trade  purchases  are  concentrated around over 12,500 suppliers.\n\n## A - Responsible purchasing\n\nIn  an  environment  where  supply  chains  are  becoming more complex, and where the collective awareness of the impacts  of  purchasing  on  stakeholders  is  growing,  the responsible purchasing program aims to integrate ethical requirements  into  the  purchasing  process,  both  for suppliers, based on the supplier charter, and for buyers, by applying  the  buyer  charter.  It  helps  manage  and  reduce the environmental, social and societal risks associated with Saint -Gobain's supply chains.\n\nThus,  ethical  criteria  respecting  human  rights,  working conditions  and  compliance  with  standards,  health  and safety  and  the  environment  are  integrated  into  the purchase process. The responsible purchasing program is implemented with high standards in accordance with the Group's  general  purchasing  principles  to  develop  longterm relationships with suppliers.\n\nThe program is based on ISO 20400. An audit conducted in  2021  by  an  independent  third  party  validated  the approach and attested to its maturity.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "Identify and manage risks and opportunities in the value chain\n\nThe 'responsible purchasing' program includes four major steps set out in Saint -Gobain's vigilance plan:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## a.  Risk management\n\nThe  CSR  risk  mapping  of  purchases,  developed  by Saint -Gobain,  includes  risks  related  to  sourcing  country and  risks  related  to  purchasing  category.  Risks  linked  to human rights, particularly forced labor and child labor, and corruption  risks  are  inherent  to  the  environment  of  the countries of origin.\n\nRisks linked to purchasing categories include environmental  performance,  and  more  specifically  the carbon and water footprints, as well as health and safety impacts.  The  mapping  uses  recognized  international sources  to  assess  the  specific  risks  by  country  and  by activity.  While  the  general  principles  and  sources  are identical,  the  impact  of  purchases  and  the  risks  for  the company  are  weighted  according  to  the  nature  of  the purchase:\n\n- \u00b7 Upstream  purchases,  managed  by  the  non-trade purchasing team;\n- \u00b7 Purchases  related  to  distribution  activity  offerings managed by the marketing distribution teams and the trade purchasing teams.\n\nIn  accordance  with  this  procedure,  purchasing  categories or suppliers with specific risks have been identified, such as:\n\n- \u00b7 Purchases of some natural raw materials such as wood or sand;\n- \u00b7 Particular  types  of  subcontractors  working  directly  on Saint -Gobain sites;\n- \u00b7 Purchases made in countries exposed to risks regarding human rights in general and child labor, corruption and working conditions in particular.\n\nIn  2023,  Saint-Gobain  updated  its  risk  mapping  using  a specialized  risk  mapping  platform  based  on  ISO  31000. For  each  purchasing  segment,  13  CSR  challenges  broken down  according  to  the  environmental,  social  and  ethical fields are analyzed along with a description of the sources of the risk.\n\nA  supplier's  risk  level  is  therefore  assessed  according  to the  risk  associated  with  its  business  sector  and  the country of its operations.\n\n\u00cb\n\nIn addition to the risk rating, each buyer has a description sheet  of  their  supplier's  risk  exposure  on  the  platform, allowing them to better target any specific risk management action plans.\n\nRisks  were  assessed  in  the  second  half  of  2023,  which called for updating the action plans and the objectives of the 'responsible purchasing' program.\n\n## b.  Risk management and mitigation measures\n\nThe process and tools used to manage risks for trade and non-trade  purchases  are  aligned.  However,  the  action plans  put  in  place  are  specific  to  each  of  the  two purchasing teams, to maintain management methods and a  level  of  control  adapted  to  the  risks  and  potential negative impacts of each of the activities.\n\n## For non-trade purchases\n\nDepending on the level of risk identified, suppliers answer an evaluation questionnaire based on documentation. It is verified and evaluated by a third party, and, depending on the  results  every  12  to  36  months  depending  on  the assessment,  an  on-site  CSR  audit  takes  place  depending on  the  results.  The  entire  approach  forms  part  of  a constant  dialog  with  the  supplier  and  leads  to  the establishment  of  action  plans  and  CSR  performance improvement plans.  In  2018,  the  evaluation  questionnaire and  its  related  score  scale  were  reviewed  to  check  that they  corresponded  to  the  types  and  levels  of  risks identified  by  the  mapping.  Since  2021,  following  the reassessment of the minimum performance thresholds, the suppliers concerned have been invited to undergo a new assessment  to  comply  with  the  Group's  reinforced requirements.\n\nSaint -Gobain has set a target of having assessed the CSR performance of more than 90% of suppliers identified as at risk and  generating  annual  revenue  of  more  than \u20ac100,000 with the Group for the period 2024-2026. Since the global health crisis in 2020 and its impacts on supply chains,  65.8%  of  these  at-risk  suppliers  have  been assessed.\n\nThe  Group  conducted  around  98  CSR  audits  in  2023, mainly in emerging countries.",

Based on the results of the assessments,  the  relevant  buyer  implements  a  corrective action  plan  with  the  supplier,  including  priorities  and deadlines for implementation.\n\nIn the event of non-compliance with these action plans or implementation  deadlines,  a  supplier  de-listing  policy  is applicable,  after  which  the  supplier  will  no  longer  have access to the Group's calls for tenders and all entities of the latter will withdraw from any ongoing partnerships.\n\nThe  Responsible  Purchasing  policy  is  being  rolled  out  to non-trade suppliers via a private digital platform developed  by  Saint -Gobain  and  entirely  dedicated  to responsible  purchasing.  Suppliers  have  access  to  it  to acknowledge  receipt  of  the  Group  Suppliers  Charter,  to send essential supporting documents electronically (wood certificates, quality certificates, ISO standards), to answer self-assessment  questionnaires,  to  obtain  all  information on Saint -Gobain's 'responsible purchasing' guidelines and to  access  details  of  their  CSR  evaluations  or,  where appropriate, CSR audits.\n\nThe  responsible purchasing approach  also  includes ongoing training for buyers on the Group code of ethics, with  particular  emphasis  on  the  fight  against  corruption, the working conditions of employees of suppliers, forced labor  and  child  labor.  Constant  information  on  the sustainable  development  stakes  is  also  communicated. The Non-Trade Purchasing Department has issued a 'Best Practices' brochure for all purchasers, to remind them of the CSR best practices to be built into the entire purchase process.\n\n## For trade purchases\n\nThe procedures and tools are aligned with those already in place for non-trade purchases. Given the different nature of purchases, certain risk criteria and their weighting and performance  monitoring  are  managed  separately  by  the marketing  and  purchasing  teams  of  the  distribution entities.  The  program  is  overseen  by  members  from  the Group's responsible purchasing team. Accordingly, synergies  and  best  practices  for  responsible  purchasing are shared between the various buyers, while performance measurement  is  both  maintained  and  adapted  to operational risks and opportunities.\n\nThis  implementation  is  coupled  with  training  sessions  for buyers. Strategic suppliers are the ones primarily targeted by  the  deployment  of  the  Responsible  Purchasing program.  This  concerns  the  European  partners  of  the distribution  entities  that  supply  more  than  \u20ac3  million  as well  as  the  main  partners  by  retailers  in  each  country. These  identified  suppliers  cover  more  than  82%  of  trade purchases.\n\nAt the same time, the marketing and purchasing teams of the 'Building Distribution' Business Unit are continuing the qualification and control audits of the plants of their ownbrand suppliers, especially in India and China. The purpose of these audits is to assess their management system, the environmental,  social  and  legal  aspects  of  production activities,  and  to  ensure  that  the  products  are  of  good quality.\n\nFollowing each audit, the supplier receives a report as well as  recommendations  on  compliance  with  an  expected effective date or paths for improvement.\n\nIdentify and manage risks and opportunities in the value chain\n\n## c.  Risk management related to natural raw materials\n\n## Sand\n\nPurchases of sand by Saint -Gobain are intended for glass and  glass  wool  production,  production  of  mortars,  and distribution  activities.  Given  the  quality  of  the  sand required for our business lines, purchases are mainly made from  open  and  mechanized  quarries.  Suppliers  undergo evaluations of their environmental and social practices as part  of  the  Responsible  Purchasing  policy.  Lastly,  the Group is implementing an action plan to reduce its sand consumption by substituting it with recycled materials as part  of  the  circular  economy  program  (see  3.4,  p.  124). Since  2018,  an  indicator  to  monitor  the  reduction  of extractions  of  virgin  natural  raw  materials  has  been implemented (see section 4.2.2, p. 153).\n\n## Timber purchases\n\nSaint -Gobain's  activities  have  an  impact  on  the  timber sector either through the supply of packaging (pallets and boxes) or by purchases of timber for construction markets as  part  of  its  distribution  activities.  Environmental  and social  risks  and  those  related  to  human  rights  adherence primarily  affect  trade  purchasing.  Through  its  timber purchasing  policy,  Saint -Gobain  is  committed  to  fighting deforestation by acting ethically and responsibly throughout  the  Group's  value  chain  to  preserve  forests, the local populations living in them, and biodiversity. This policy was issued in the early 2000s and updated in 2020.\n\nTo control risks and ensure traceability of purchases, the 'Timber  Purchasing'  policy  is  based  on  a  due  diligence method  in  compliance  with  the  requirements  of  the European  Union  Timber  Regulation  (EUTR),  and  the recommendations of recognized institutions or specialized non-governmental organizations (NGOs), such as the red list of  endangered  species  maintained  by  the  IUCN (International  Union  for  Conservation  of  Nature)  and reports of NGOs involved in the fight against deforestation.  In  particular,  for  species  or  regions  at  risk, specific  certifications  are  required,  such  as  the  FSC\u00ae (Forest  Stewardship  Council)  label.  The  Group  is  also assessing  and  preparing  for  the  implementation  of  the European Union Deforestation Regulation (EUDR).\n\nTo  ensure  that  the  risks  related  to  purchases  can  be controlled,  Saint -Gobain  carries  out  an  inventory  of  its timber products purchases and their derivatives. This year, 95.8%  of  wood  and  derivative  products  are  purchased according to the responsible purchasing criteria defined in the policy concerning timber purchasing. An audit of this inventory was carried out by a third party specializing in deforestation issues at the end of the year in 2020 and has confirmed the solidity of the program to secure purchases and  compliance  with  the  policy  concerning  timber purchasing.\n\nAs part of a continuous improvement process, the Group maintains  a  transparent  and  regular  dialog  with  nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) to promote responsible forest management.\n\nSaint -Gobain has not completed the CDP questionnaire on forests  since  2020.  The  Group  shares  CDP's  objective  of combating deforestation for responsible forest management. It  seeks  a  transparent  dialog  with  the  CDP  so  that  the specific nature of construction timber is better valued in the ratings.  The  questionnaire  is  currently  focused  on  issues related  to  the  use  of  palm  oil  or  exotic  species  which  are little  or  not  present in the construction business lines. As a result, the answers to the questionnaire and the assessment are  not  very  representative  of  the  conducted  actions  and their efficiency.\n\n<!-- image -->",

By ensuring the optimization of inventory levels, supply chain efficiency is also a crucial factor  in  cash  management.  The  supply  chain  is  also  a major contributor to any corporate sustainability approach.\n\nThe Group's supply chains are mainly local and managed by country organizations. Global coordination and a team of  experts  allow  common  logistics  optimization  tools, dedicated training and customized supply chain improvement  programs  to  be  provided.  These  teams  of experts work directly in the countries with the support of the general management bodies to raise awareness of all functions, identify potential for improvement and draw up action  plans  to  be  implemented  by  the  country  teams. Depending on the maturity of local supply chains, actions may involve optimizing the management of product lines by  the  marketing  teams,  implementing  collaborative processes,  developing  the  client  culture  at  the  sites, adapting planning (client forecasts such as plant\n\nscheduling)  or  optimizing  transport.  The  objective  is  to maximize customer satisfaction while optimizing financial and environmental impacts.\n\nSaint -Gobain has also developed digital programs such as 'Supply Chain 4.0' to optimize transport. Whether it is for its  purchases  or  client  delivery,  the  Group  has  programs for  route  optimization,  optimal  vehicle  loading  and  more efficient  travel  planning  by  coordinating  inbound  and outbound transport to avoid empty kilometers.\n\nThus, the Group uses supply chain modeling, optimization and simulation software to find the best balance between delivery times, costs, inventories and carbon footprint.\n\nThe  in-house  teams  also  develop  digital  solutions  to improve forecasts by integrating data mining and artificial intelligence  algorithms.  The  supply  chain  support  teams work with the central finance teams to test process mining solutions to improve process execution performance.\n\nThe impact of these scope 3 reduction efforts (categories 4 and 9) are described in section 3.3.3.B.b, p. 122.\n\n## 3.2.2 THE GROUP'S ACTIVITIES\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSaint -Gobain's industrial and trade activities have an impact on the environment, employees and stakeholders, especially local residents near the sites.\n\nTo manage its risks, Saint -Gobain has implemented shared risk identification and measurement methods. They are rolled out  at  all  sites  worldwide.  The  Group  implements  risk  prevention  and  control  policies  for  both  industrial  risks  and environmental, health and safety risks.\n\n\u00cb",

        "page_content": "## A - Industrial and distribution risks\n\n## a. Industrial and distribution risk prevention policy\n\nThe  aim  of  the  industrial  and  distribution  risk  prevention policy is  to  reduce  the  likelihood  of  accidental  events,  to minimize  their  severity  if  they  do  occur,  and  finally  to preserve the continuity of business operations. This policy applies to all Saint -Gobain sites.\n\nDefined  and  led  by  the  Risk  and  Insurance  Department, this policy is rolled out within the organization to the sites by a network of prevention coordinators. A risk prevention manual  is  the  Group  reference  base  and  is  available  in some  fifteen languages. It includes the applicable standards,  procedures  and  technical  rules,  methods  for identifying and reducing risks, including natural risks, and the  drafting  of  emergency  and  business  continuity  plans. This manual may be shared with the relevant stakeholders, such  as  permanent  on-site  subcontractors.  The  risk assessment  tool  is  used  by  all  operational  sites  and provides  an  objective  assessment  of  the  protection  and prevention level. It takes into account both human factors (organization,  procedures,  communication,  training,  etc.) and physical facilities. This means that each site is able to identify  its  areas  for  improvement,  develop  action  plans including  investments,  and  use  the  tool  to  measure progress.  The  tool  is  accompanied  by  periodic  site  visits by prevention engineering: a total of 353 sites were visited in 2023.\n\nThe Group is rolling out business continuity plans for each site according to the risk assessment and the vulnerability of  processes  to  unforeseen  interruptions  including  an anticipation of the impacts of an accident so as to limit its effects. The aim is to fully or partially ensure client service and recover operational capacities as quickly as possible. The  subcontractors  working  on  the  sites  are  involved  in the  process  and  must  commit  to  a  prevention  plan.  In 2023,  28  sites  were  visited  by  prevention  engineering specifically  to  verify  the  quality  of  their  continuity  plans against the Group's guidelines in this area.\n\nSaint -Gobain  constantly  adapts  its  risk  management system to better anticipate the potential risks associated with  the  effects  of  climate  change.  In  2022,  this  system was enhanced with a study conducted on the effects  of climate  change  in  the  major  regions  where  Saint -Gobain operates.  This  study  was  conducted  for  over  500 industrial sites in 52 countries. The potential impacts were analyzed  based  on  various  global  warming  scenarios. Action plans to further increase prevention, particularly in the  face  of  natural  disaster  risks,  are  being  rolled  out.  In particular,  they  include  changes  in  the  design  of  certain sites  to  reduce,  where  necessary,  the  impacts  of  these natural events, especially flooding. In 2023, 28 at-risk sites were visited specifically to check their exposure to natural disasters, especially flooding.\n\nIdentify and manage risks and opportunities in the value chain\n\n## b.  Environmental, health, and safety risks\n\nWhether it is certified (ISO or equivalent) or not, each site of the Group  carries  out  its own  assessment  of environmental,  health  and  safety  risks  under  the  site officer's responsibility. To do this, a standardized method has  been  deployed  and  is  regularly  updated.  Training courses  are  organized  for  site  teams,  and  a  digital application  incorporating  risk  analysis,  assessment  and management  actions  has  been  developed.  This  tool facilitates the deployment, reliability and monitoring of risk management action plans at all of the Group's sites.\n\nAn  environmental,  health,  and  safety  risk  matrix  is  also included  in  the  internal  control  reference  framework. Compliance audits are conducted, and external certification  procedures  supplement  the  control  system. An internal audit standard also enables the monitoring and verification of action plans at the sites.\n\nAudits of the environmental, health, and safety management  system  are  conducted  by  the  functional department concerned. These audits are  conducted  as  a priority  at  ISO-certified  or  equivalent  sites.  In  addition  to these audits, a version of the audit methodology has been developed  for  smaller  sites  for  which  ISO  certification  is less suitable.\n\nLastly, a training matrix defines the training on managing environmental,  health,  and  safety  risks  for  the  teams according to the position held. It is a particularly relevant tool to use to define employee training courses.\n\n## B - Employee health and safety\n\nThe health and safety of employees are absolute priorities, and  Saint -Gobain  makes  them  central  to  its  corporate culture. It is important for everyone to participate in their own health and safety, and those of all of their colleagues.\n\n## a.  Managing health risks\n\n## Measuring the exposure to health risks for employees.\n\nSaint -Gobain  has  defined  a  risk  control  indicator  for  the health  of  its  staff  relating  to  its  activities  in  line  with  its health standards.\n\nFollowing  the  HICE  (Health  Indicator  for  oCcupational Exposure)  indicator  targeting  noise  exposure  (HICE Noise), a new indicator dedicated to exposure to chemical agents  has  been  calculated  since  early  2023  (HICE Chemicals).  The  health  indicators  are  applied  to  all  sites affected  by  exposure  to  noise  and/or  chemical  agents. They correspond to the rate of potential exposure to these health  hazards  and  aim  to  promote  the  prioritization  of actions to reduce risks of exposure for employees on the sites.\n\nThe 'HICE Bruit' indicator has been communicated twice a year  to  the  Group's  Executive  Committee  since  its deployment in 2021. At the end of 2023, it stands at 14.5, which means that,  on  average,  at  each  site,  14.5%  of  the work situations of employees and permanent subcontractors  are  subject  to  potential  noise  exposure. HICE Noise was equal to 17.4 in 2022.\n\n<!-- image -->",

HICE is the percentage of potential exposure to hazardous substances that should be reduced. In 2023, 19% of performed risk assessments were validated  by  a  trained  person  in  accordance  with  the Saint -Gobain  requirements  listed  in  the  'risk  assessment and control'  standard.  The  people  in  charge  of  validating must have completed the e-learning on the Boost platform. For these sites, the indicator is at HICE 9.4: this means that on  average,  on  each  site,  9.4%  of  the  work  situations  of employees  and  permanent  subcontractors  are  potentially exposed to chemical substances. For the remaining 81% of sites that need to start or improve their risk assessment, a default  maximum  exposure  of  100%  is  considered.  The average for the whole Group is 82.8.\n\n## Risks associated with hazardous substances and products\n\nSaint -Gobain  is  committed  to  reducing  and  controlling chemical  risks  (hazardous  substances  and  products,  dust). Three complementary tools have been developed to support the sites in managing chemical risks:\n\n- \u00b7 The internal standard and its implementation guide on the  assessment  and  control  of  the  risk  linked  to chemical  agents  provides  guidance  to  industrial  sites how to conduct a periodic assessment of exposure to hazardous  substances  according  to  precise  minimum rules.  It  is  supplemented  by  risk  management  guides (ventilation and personal protective equipment, examples  of  chemical  management  and  storage procedures,  activity-specific  product  inventories,  etc.) as well as training kits;\n- \u00b7 The  SBASE  database  provides  a  list  of  chemical substances  and  their  classification,  according  to  their level of danger on the basis of an internal classification system. This database is updated on an ongoing basis by internal and external experts in response to changes in the classification of the various regulatory frameworks, such as REACH in Europe;\n- \u00b7 The SAFHEAR management tool allows each industrial site to prepare and document its own inventory of the chemical  substances  and  products  used  and  also potentially generated  during  industrial production processes.  In  the  second  phase,  it  allows  sites  to document the results  of  exposure  assessments.  These data are consolidated worldwide.\n\nThe  inventory  of  products  and  substances  used  by Saint -Gobain entities is a continuous improvement process. As of the end of 2023, 87% of the sites have used SAFHEAR to update their inventory. The Group's objective is  to  have  100%  of  its  sites  covered  by  an  up-to-date inventory by the end of 2025 (see section 4.2.2, p. 153).\n\nTraining,  educational  materials  and  technical  assistance help develop the skills of health managers on site. In 2023, more than 1,700 people have taken at least one e-learning module related to the assessment and control of chemical risks.\n\nLastly,  Saint -Gobain  actively  monitors  updates  to  the European list of candidate substances for authorization or subject to authorization or restriction and anticipates the deadlines  for  authorization  of  substances,  in  order  to complete  its  substitution  and  to  fulfill  its  communication obligations with its clients.\n\n\u00cb\n\nIn countries outside the European Union, subject to other chemical  regulations  such  as  the  US  Toxic  Substance Control  Act,  the  Environmental  Protection  Act  and  the Chemicals Management Plan in Canada, or China REACH in  China,  the  Group  applies  the  regulations  in  force  and monitors their evolution.\n\nThis  cross-functional  control  of  the  management  of chemical  substances  and  products  is  also  part  of  the product innovation and stakeholder information processes, particularly for consumers.\n\n## Managing the risks of musculoskeletal disorders\n\nA standard for assessing factors that may contribute to the occurrence  of  musculoskeletal  disorders  and  a  grid  for detecting  ergonomic  factors  were  developed  in  2021.  The ergonomics  standard  lists  the  risk  factors  to  be  assessed and  specifies  the  method  for  assessing  these  risks,  in particular  on  the  basis  of  international  standards  (for example,  EN  ISO  14738:2008  and  ISO  11228-3).  The detection grid is an easy-to-use tool that lists the criteria to be assessed. It aims to identify improvements to be made to a work situation through a before/after rating.\n\nThe Group has a set of information and precautions as to the  use  of  exoskeletons.  A  dedicated  platform  brings together the results of the work and recommendations of the INRS ( Institut national de recherche et de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 - the French  national  research  and  safety  institute  for  the prevention of occupational accidents and diseases) and the IFA  ( Institut  f\u00fcr  Arbeitsschutz  der  Deutschen  Gesetzlichen Unfallversicherung -  the  institute  for  occupational  health and  safety  of  German  social  insurance  body  covering accidents)  to  cover  the  use  of  an  exoskeleton  for  the prevention of musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs).\n\n## b.  Daily safety management\n\nSaint -Gobain's  safety  commitment  applies  not  only  to  its employees  and  temporary  staff,  but  also  to  on-site subcontractors.  A  training  and  awareness-raising  course on  specific  risks  related  to  the  presence  of  on-site subcontractors  is  offered  to  the  teams  of  the  sites.  The buyer  network  is  also  involved  in  training  and  informing subcontractors  on  the  security  standards  to  be  put  in place and respected.\n\nAt the end of 2023, the TRAR (total recordable accident rate with and  without  lost time for Saint -Gobain employees, temporary workers and permanent subcontractors) was 1.3. It was 1.5 at the end of December 2022. The TRAR indicator has decreased by 18% between 2022 and 2023 and by 52% between 2017 and 2023.\n\nAt the end of 2023, 79% of the entities had reported no occupational  accidents,  versus  76%  at  the  end  of  2023. The  'Millionaires  Club'  comprises  the  most  exemplary Group sites in terms of safety, with 1 million hours worked or  five  years  without  any  accidents  involving  lost  time, including all the individuals present on a site (employees, temporary  workers,  subcontractors,  visitors,  etc.).  At  the end of 2023, a total of 234 sites were in the 'Millionaires Club,' compared with 236 at the end of 2022. It values the entities that have the best results and that demonstrate to all  that  the  objective  of  zero  work-related  accidents  is possible. Among these sites, 85 are 'Silver Millionaires' (with ten years without a lost-time accident) and  57  'Gold  Millionaires'  (with  15  years  without  a  losttime accident).",

        "page_content": "## C - Preserving the environment\n\nThe  management  of  environmental  risks  relies  on  the environmental management system (see section 2.3.3.B. b, p. 87), the action plans carried out within the framework of the \"environment\" pillar of the WCM (see section 2.3.3.A, p. 84).\n\n## a. Air emissions\n\nAir  emissions  from  Saint-Gobain  production  sites  are mainly carbon dioxide (CO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx) and dust.\n\nThe  Group  does  not  significantly  emit  any  other greenhouse gases (GHGs) besides carbon. The action plan to  control  CO2  emissions  across  its  entire  value  chain (scopes  1,  2  and  3)  is  described  in  its  2030  carbon roadmap (see section 3.3.3.B, p. 120). Beyond 2030, a new action plan will be drawn up to meet the objective of zero net emissions by 2050.\n\nRegarding  emissions  into  the  air  other  than  carbon, emission control actions primarily involve measures known as  primary  control  measures  of  industrial  processes described in the environmental pillar of the WCM program (section  2.3.3.A,  p.  84).  When  these  measures  are  not sufficient, secondary measures are deployed. They involve investment  in  air  pollution  control  equipment  to  treat emissions. These equipments are deployed for each of the Group's  businesses  according  to  technical  constraints. Thus,  Saint-Gobain  Glass  continues  to  implement  air pollution control equipment  across  all  of  its  float production  lines,  taking  advantage  of  shutdowns  and repairs.  Out  of  its  28  glass  furnaces,  23  of  them  have  a dust  and  SO2  treatment  system,  and  13  have  a  NOx treatment system.\n\nDust emissions are controlled by investments in electrostatic precipitators or bag filters, depending on the type  of  industrial  facility.  This  equipment  also  makes  it possible to filter the heavy metals resulting from impurities contained in certain raw materials.\n\n## b. Water management\n\n## Preserving water resources\n\nAn action plan to reduce water withdrawals is implemented across all sites, with prioritization of actions based  on  the  intensity  of  withdrawals  and  the  risks  of water stress associated with the site's location.\n\nTo assess the water sensitivity of its sites, the Group uses the global 'Aqueduct' atlas of the WRI organization. This atlas  is  based  not  only  on  qualitative  and  quantitative physical risks (such as water stress or flood risk), but also on stakeholder risk (like access to water). This tool enables each industrial  site  to  assess  its  water  risk  from  'low'  to 'extremely high.' In 2023, 257 sites representing approximately  19%  of  Saint -Gobain's  water  withdrawals and  10%  of  its  discharge  were  located  in  high-risk  or extremely high-risk areas.\n\nIn  order  to  reduce  water  withdrawals  from  the  sites, closed-loop  water  recycling  equipment  is  being  invested in.  In  2023,  88%  of  the  consumed  water  is  reused  in production processes through internal recycling systems.\n\nIdentify and manage risks and opportunities in the value chain\n\nTo  address  the  growing  risks  associated  with  access  to water resources, site continuity plans may incorporate this dimension based on their location and the water needs of other  stakeholders,  particularly  the  drinking  water  needs of local populations and water needs for agriculture.\n\n## The risks of water pollution\n\nMost  of  the  water  discharges  are  from  cooling  plants where  the  water  does  not  come  into  contact  with  any chemicals used in the process. The risks of impact on the quality of water  discharges  are  limited  to  certain Saint -Gobain work, such as the manufacture of fiberglass and glass wool, the use of certain  ceramic  materials  and certain types of abrasives and the use of certain products in  our  chemical  construction  business.  Industrial  sites  are required to comply with local regulations and environmental  permits  regarding  effluent  treatment  and quality measures. In 2022, the Group published a technical guide on water efficiency for these industrial sites, which defines the applicable treatments according to the nature of the waste.\n\nSaint-Gobain  has  put  in  place  a  program  to  reduce  the presence  of  hazardous  substances  on  its  sites  and  in  its productions.  Identification  of  these  substances  is  carried out, and a reduction program for their presence is initiated (see section 2.3.3.B.a, p. 85). Concurrently, the innovation program  for  Saint-Gobain's products and solutions (see  section  3.2.3.C,  p.  77)  incorporates  the  objective  of eliminating or at least limiting the presence of hazardous substances on the sites and controlling  potential  risks  to health  and  the  environment  during  production  processes and throughout the value chain.\n\n## c. Preserving biodiversity\n\nA  mapping  study  of  all  Saint -Gobain  sites,  carried  out using  geographic  tools  such  as  WDPA,  is  updated regularly  and  makes  it  possible  to  assess  their  sensitivity to  ecosystems  based  on  their  proximity  to  areas  of  high biodiversity  value.  The  protected  areas  considered  are areas  recognized  by  the  International  Union  for  the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) or more locally defined as Natura  2000  or  RAMSAR  areas.  In  2019,  the  study  was continued, adding as criteria the environmental impact of the sites, the expectations of stakeholders and the actions already  undertaken  in  terms  of  biodiversity.  This  made  it possible  to  finalize  a  list  of  around  one  hundred  priority sites in 2021, the vast majority of which were quarries, for the implementation of biodiversity management plans and the sharing of best practices.\n\nA training module explaining the challenges of biodiversity and  the  successful  implementation  of  a  biodiversity management  plan  was  rolled  out  in  2022,  and  around twenty  best  practices  in  terms  of  biodiversity  were distributed internally.\n\nSaint -Gobain participates in the 'Act4nature International' program,  a  voluntary  commitment  to  biodiversity  from international  companies:  one  of  the  strong  commitments concerns the implementation of biodiversity management plans for all active open-cast quarries by 2025.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The limitation of natural resources and waste management\n\nSaint-Gobain  faces  a  potential  risk  of  scarcity  of  raw materials  used  in  the  formulations  of  its  products  and solutions. The Group's strategy aims to reduce the natural resource  intensity  of  the  products  and  solutions  offered and  to  promote  the  substitution  of  raw  materials  with renewable  or  recycled  materials.  For  certain  natural resources  identified  as  at  risk,  such  as  sand  or  wood, specific monitoring measures for purchases and suppliers are implemented in accordance with responsible purchasing policies or the Timber Policy (see section 3.2.1. A.c, p. 97).\n\nThe  Group  has  implemented  an  action  plan  by  business and by country to optimize the use of resources from their extraction  to  end-of-life  and  minimize  the  generation  of\n\nnon-recovered  waste  at  each  stage  of  the  life  cycle  of products and solutions brought to the market (see section 3.4.3. p. 128).\n\nBeyond  their  environmental  impact  and  the  waste  of resources represented by industrial waste from sites, their recovery  in  recycling  circuits  prevents  their  burial  and potential environmental consequences  such  as  soil pollution or groundwater pollution.\n\nFinally, Saint-Gobain  generates  a  limited  amount  of hazardous waste (7% in 2023), more than half of which is recovered. In line with Saint-Gobain's health policy and in compliance  with  local  regulations,  the  management  of hazardous waste is subject to special monitoring to ensure the  protection  of  the  health  of  employees,  residents, customers, and users of its products and services.\n\n## 3.2.3 MARKETS, THE USE AND MANAGEMENT OF THE END OF LIFE OF SOLUTIONS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## A - An innovation process incorporating sustainability and performance issues\n\nSaint -Gobain  regularly  develops  its  innovation  methods and processes to meet  new  market  expectations, particularly  the  development  of  ever  more  sustainable solutions (products, systems and services).\n\nThe innovation approach, made up of iterations, creativity, agility  and  openness  to  the  outside  world  (university, partners,  etc.),  puts  the  client  at  the  heart  of  the  project from  the  identification  of  needs  to  the  validation  of prototypes.\n\nThe  methods  used  concern  both  local  projects  and international projects (via pilot countries).\n\nInnovation methods initially rely on the marketing teams, which  are  involved  in  the  characterization  of  needs (functional analysis) and formalize functional specifications.\n\nTo integrate EHS (Environment, Health and Safety) issues, a checklist has been used in the Group since 2008.\n\nThis EHS checklist provides a qualitative assessment of the substances used in product formulations, allowing environmental  and  health  impacts  to  be  identified  and reduced throughout the product life cycle.\n\nIn  2023,  Saint-Gobain initiated a transition to replace the EHS checklist with a new EHS standard and a new tool for integrating sustainability into the innovation process.\n\nThe  main  objectives  of  the  new  EHS  standard  for innovation are:\n\n- \u00b7 eliminating  or  limiting  the  presence  of  hazardous substances  in  new  products  placed  on  the  market  by Saint-Gobain and used in the downstream value chain;\n- \u00b7 eliminating  or  limiting  and  controlling  potential  health and environmental risks during production processes at Saint -Gobain sites.\n\nA  new  tool  is  also  available  to  the  marketing  and  R&D teams to help them integrate sustainability issues at every stage  of  the  innovation  process.  This  tool  focuses  on market trends and client needs in terms of sustainability. It defines and monitors targets for reducing the environmental  footprint  and  maximizing  the  health  and well-being benefits of new products brought to market, in line with Saint-Gobain's strategy.\n\nThese methods, standards and tools are a true foundation for  the  development of innovation for the marketing and R&D teams. Clients  are  also  involved  in  the  validation  of industrialized solutions before their launch.\n\nIn addition, a monitoring procedure integrating every step in the innovation process allows for the rapid identification and consideration of potential difficulties prompt attention to  potential  problems.  Close  monitoring  of  the  progress achieved  and  product  performance  means  that  the process of innovation is faster and more secure.\n\nIdentify and manage risks and opportunities in the value chain\n\nThe  innovation  process  also  incorporates  normative  and regulatory  requirements,  from  the  functional  marketing specifications  stage.  Local  marketing  teams  ensure  that products comply with regulations and standards applicable  in  the  countries  of  commercialization.  The process for launching new products, systems and services is  checked  within  the  framework  of  internal  control  (see section 6.2.2, p. 262). It is regularly updated to improve the quality  management  system  procedures  and  associated monitoring  indicators.  Technical  products  are  launched after  sales  force  training  and  reinforced  support  by product  managers  and  technical  trainers.  In  several countries,  they  intervene  directly  on  the  worksites  when installers use a differentiating innovation for the first time, throughout the launch phases until the sales organization reaches  a  sufficient  level  of  maturity.  The  marketing  and sales community, which brings together teams in different countries and  activities, shares best practices and facilitates the integration of newly acquired brands.\n\nSaint-Gobain University's Unicampus program (see section 2.3.2.C.b,  p.  81)  offers  five  training  courses  related  to  the innovation  process.  These  training  courses  are  primarily intended for the marketing and R&D functions but also aim to  raise  awareness  across  all  functions.  A  product compliance training module has also been integrated into the program. Concrete courses combining theory, practice and experience sharing are offered widely to the principal offices  involved  in  the  innovation  process,  such  as marketing,  R&D,  purchasing,  production  and  industrial efficiency.\n\nA new training course was launched in 2021, 'Derisking a key success factor for your innovations,' whose objective is to greatly increase  the  success  and  impact  of innovations while reducing lead times by relying on better anticipation.  Built  around  the  Business  Model  Canvas,  it helps  identify  all  types  of  risks  and  conditions  for  the success of innovation projects at each stage of development, including launch.\n\nLastly,  the  World  Class  Manufacturing  (WCM)  industrial excellence program (see section 2.3.3.A, p. 84) ensures the deployment  of  best  practices  in  terms  of  quality  and product  compliance  at  industrial  sites,  based  on  the ISO 9001.\n\nAt the European level, the Group contributes to the work of the European Committee for Standardization (CEN) in developing standards and regulatory systems. Likewise, its active participation in European interprofessional associations  such  as  EURIMA,  Eurogypsum,  Glass  for Europe and EMO provides input into the Group's vision of standards  development  in  Europe,  in  particular  through exchanges  with  the  European  Commission  and  its institutions  such  as  the  European  Chemical  Agency (ECHA)  in  charge  of  the  REACH  regulation.  This  work fosters the innovation process within the Group, enabling it to anticipate and go beyond regulatory changes.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Saint -Gobain  also  provides  non-mandatory  information specific to some of its products, such as:\n\n- \u00b7 voluntary safety data declaration sheets for unclassified articles or substances;\n- \u00b7 the declaration of the composition of components and materials via the IMDS database (International Material Data System) in the case of the automotive industry;\n- \u00b7 Environmental Product Declarations (EPD) for construction  products  (or  Environmental  and  Health Declaration Forms (FDES) in France);\n- \u00b7 voluntary  certifications  obtained  through  independent national  laboratories  -  or,  failing  that,  international laboratories  close  to  these  markets  -  when  innovative products or systems are not covered by international or national standards.\n\nSpecific  measures  related  to  the  product  compliance program are presented in section 6.2.5, p. 273.\n\n## B - Quality and the product compliance program\n\nThe  Group's  Quality  Department  aims  to  increase customer  satisfaction  by  improving  the  quality  approach through  product  compliance  and  reducing  costs  of  poor quality.\n\nThe quality culture developed at the sites is based on the ISO  9001  or  IATF  16494  certification  standards,  the 'Quality & Process Control' pillar of the WCM program or the  'Internal  Quality  Control'  reference  framework  (see section 6.2.2, p. 262). Training programs on the culture and tools of quality and compliance are also offered as part of Unicampus  (see  section  2.3.2.C.b,  p.  81)  or  e-learning courses available on the Group's training platform.\n\nAs  product  compliance  is  a  constantly  evolving  process, Saint -Gobain has complemented the measures already in place in 2021 with a program to strengthen the culture of product quality and compliance. The program is designed to remind countries and local teams of the key principles and processes related to product quality and compliance throughout  the  product  life  cycle,  from  design  to production, marketing, use and finally end of life.\n\nThis program includes four steps:\n\n- \u00b7 Awareness campaigns at all Group levels;\n- \u00b7 Definition of a roadmap by local management teams;\n- \u00b7 Evaluation  of  the  effectiveness  of  organizations  and processes in the countries for each activity;\n- \u00b7 Definition and implementation of sustainable improvement plans if necessary.\n\n\u00cb\n\nA network of local facilitators  (more  than  150  facilitators trained  by  the  end  of  2023)  has  been  set  up  to  support the teams in the countries or activities during deployment and  to  ensure  the  sharing  of  best  practices,  thus promoting  the  continuous  improvement  of  procedures. The progress of the program's implementation is monitored by a committee created for this purpose and is regularly presenting to the Executive Committee members. The Group's internal control teams also assess the effective implementation of the program.\n\n## C - A range of sustainable and efficient solutions\n\nSaint -Gobain's ambition is to offer solutions that combine performance  and  sustainability  to  meet  the  expectations of  its  stakeholders,  in  particular  its  clients,  and  to  enable acceleration  towards  a  more  sustainable  and  low-carbon economy.\n\nIn  order  to  standardize  the  assessment  of  the  impact  of the proposed solutions and accelerate differentiation in its various  markets,  use  cases  have  been  developed  to illustrate  the  value  provided  by  Saint -Gobain  solutions. These  use  cases  have  been  developed  for  3  markets: decarbonization of industry thanks to the solutions of the HPS Business Units, renovation and sustainable construction for the construction Business Units. For each use case, local teams  identify  solutions combining products  and  services  offered  by  the  brands  and distribution networks. The tools developed enable them to assess the benefits and thus adapt the offer and the sales pitch  to  the  expectations  of  the  stakeholders  in  the markets concerned.\n\nThe  \"Solutions  for  Growth\"  program  incorporates  these use cases, covers more than 90% of Saint -Gobain's sales, and  helps  guide  Saint -Gobain's  offer  towards  sustainable construction markets. The \"Solutions for Growth\" methodology  used  to  identify  sustainable  solutions  is available  on  the  Group's  website  and  has  been  reviewed by an independent third party.\n\nThe criteria used to measure environmental benefits are:\n\n- \u00b7 Reduction  of  energy  consumption  and  the  carbon footprint;\n- \u00b7 Optimization  of  non-renewable  natural  resources  and water resources;\n- \u00b7 Contribution to reduction of the environmental footprint of other sectors.\n\nThe  criteria  used  to  evaluate  the  benefits  in  terms  of health, safety and well-being are:\n\n- \u00b7 Reduction of occupational risks along the value chain;\n- \u00b7 Ergonomics for contractors;\n- \u00b7 Indoor  air  quality  and  acoustic,  thermal  and  visual comfort for end clients, occupants of the buildings.",

The implementation and results of this strategy are integrated into  scenarios  that  limit  global  warming  to  below  a  1.5\u00b0C rise versus the pre-industrial era, so that they are aligned with the Paris Agreement.\n\nIn  the  face  of  climate  risks,  taking  action  as  closely  as possible to the regions (countries, regions, etc.) makes it possible to rely on resilient local ecosystems that are more favorable to the development of a 'low-carbon' economy. The ability to initiate local partnerships is an asset in risk management.\n\nIn addition,  Saint -Gobain's  organizational  structure  is based on a unique combination of local and global, which makes it possible to benefit from new opportunities that meet  local  needs  while  being  part  of  global  dynamics, especially in terms of energy-efficient building renovation and the development of lightweight construction (see section 2.1.1.B, p. 66).\n\nBuildings  and  construction  account  for  around  37%.of annual  CO2  emissions  worldwide (1) .  Two  thirds  of  the sector's  carbon  impact  comes  from  the  operation  of buildings,  while  the  remaining  one  third  comes  from  the emissions contained in building products in particular. The transition of the buildings and construction sector towards carbon neutrality is therefore essential in the fight against climate change (see section 3.3, p. 106).\n\n## Maximizing contribution through innovative solutions\n\nSaint-Gobain's solutions help reduce the negative impact of the construction sector. The Group is focusing its action plans around the following areas:\n\n- \u00b7 Offering  solutions  that  provide  benefits  during  the building  operation  phase  (use  phase):  the  design, production and distribution of high-performance solutions with a positive contribution to the environment, i.e., solutions that promote  energy efficiency  and  reduce  CO2  emissions  during  the  use phase of buildings;\n- \u00b7 solutions  for  decarbonizing  industrial  processes  or manufactured products, such as the additives developed by the Construction Chemicals Business Unit to reduce the carbon impact of cement and concrete;\n- \u00b7 Offering low-carbon solutions by reducing emissions in its operations (scope 1 and 2) and emissions related to its value chain (scope 3) to reduce the carbon content of buildings.\n\n## Minimizing the Group's carbon footprint towards zero net emissions (scopes 1, 2 and 3)\n\nThe goal is to achieve a 100% reduction in the Group's net direct  and  indirect  carbon  emissions  by  2050.  At  least 90% of this objective will be achieved through the efforts of the sustainable transformation of its industrial processes and its  value  chain  and  less  than  10%  through carbon sequestration offsetting measures.\n\nThe action plan for reducing carbon emissions (scopes 1, 2 and 3) is divided into two periods:\n\n- \u00b7 2020  to  2030:  Saint-Gobain  is  rolling  out  its  '2030 carbon' roadmap, which has two ambitions:\n- -achieving,  between  2017  and  2030,  the  reduction targets (in absolute  terms)  of  33%  of  CO2e emissions under scopes 1 and 2 and a 16% reduction in  CO2e emissions under scope 3. These objectives are validated by the Science-Based Targets initiative (SBTi), which considers them to be aligned with the Paris agreement and a 1.5\u00b0C trajectory.\n- -innovating and  testing  industrial processes  to achieve net zero emissions for the three scopes.\n- \u00b7 2030 to 2050: the roadmap will be adapted based on the  results  obtained  during  the  previous  period.  The innovations identified during the implementation of the '2030  carbon'  roadmap  will  be  rolled  out.  Carbon capture  projects  may  be  activated  at  the  end  of  the period to supplement the transformation measures up to a maximum of 10% of emissions (scopes 1, 2 and 3).\n\nTo  support  this  carbon  roadmap,  Saint-Gobain  has committed  to  investing  at  least  \u20ac100  million  a  year  in CAPEX and R&D over the period 2020 to 2030.\n\nShort-  and  long-term  executive  compensation  packages include performance indicators on the carbon roadmap.\n\nFinancing  tools  such  as  the  Sustainability  Link  Bond  and Sustainability  Link  Loan  have  been  issued  for  2022  and 2023.\n\n## Involving stakeholders\n\nThe fight against climate change requires the cooperation of  all  stakeholders  -  in  particular  states,  businesses  and civil society -around a demanding international framework.\n\nSaint-Gobain is committed to working with its stakeholders to implement rapid action plans based on the shared  objective  of  limiting  the  rise  in  temperatures  to 1.5\u00b0C. To this end, action is being taken:\n\n- \u00b7 with  its  employees:  through  training  to  help  them understand the issues, by making resources available to them  to  enable  them  to  take  action,  such  as  carbon funds,  or  by  participating  together  in  sponsorship projects  to  accelerate  the  renovation  of  housing  for excluded populations or to help populations exposed to the effects of climate change ;\n- \u00b7 with our  partners:  suppliers, customers,  lobbying partners, international institutions and governments, to accelerate the transition to more sustainable construction and a low-carbon industry;\n- \u00b7 in  the  countries  and  local  communities  where  we  are present,  to  get  involved  in  public  debate  on  local climate issues, provide training in sustainable construction  skills,  and  support  associations  to  help vulnerable populations.",

Most people continue to travel by car. |\n\n## METHOD OF CONSTRUCTION\n\n- \u00b7 Two models emerge: firstly, the European model, and secondly, the US model.\n- \u00b7 In Europe, the majority of the population lives in office buildings built in 2000 and converted into residential buildings in 2030. The individual apartments are small, but benefit from large shared spaces (workspaces, fitness, high-tech kitchens). A centralized monitoring system automatically adapts heat, lighting, ventilation and cooling. Shared appliances in kitchens and laundry rooms are very efficient and use little energy. The roof is equipped with photovoltaic panels and the insulation has been reinforced with recycled materials.\n- \u00b7 In the United States, the majority of the population lives in apartment buildings and private condominiums in the suburbs of a large city, in buildings dating from the 1970s. Only a minority of individual apartments have been renovated. Energy consumption is not systematically monitored. However, installations have been put in place to mitigate the effects of climate change on the comfort of residents: the insulation of the walls and roof has been improved and double-glazed windows have been installed. Most devices are programmable, but none are shared.\n\n## Highway to Climate Hell scenario\n\n## SUSTAINABLE CITY\n\n| Model of existing city   | London, Rio de Janeiro, some US cities, Lagos, Lima, New Cairo                                                                                                             |\n|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Size                     | These immense cities occupy a vast territory and are home to 3 to 5 million inhabitants.

Poor quality is often accompanied by raised living spaces, a lack of daylight, thermal discomfort, high levels of noise pollution and inadequate ventilation of fresh air. Basic insulation solutions are still incompatible with the affordability required for such 'slum sanitation' approaches. Implementation of cooling processes as the only response to global warming. Access to basic services (wastewater,  drinking  water,  electricity,  sanitation,  waste  disposal)  is  an  important  step  towards  achieving  the  fundamental objectives of human development. Recycling, reuse and the circular economy can only be considered when these basic services have been fully realized.\n\n## b.  The 2050 vision\n\n## The '2050 net zero emissions' contribution program\n\nIn addition to the programs initiated at site level, reducing the carbon footprint of production and thus the impact of the products requires three major strategies:\n\n- \u00b7 Innovation  and  R&D  programs  to  coordinate  and expand  efforts  to  improve  manufacturing  processes, reduce  energy  consumption  and  ensure  the  transition towards the use of decarbonized energies;\n- \u00b7 Scope 3 control to identify the main emissions factors and mitigate the overall impact of the products;\n- \u00b7 Management tools and financial resources to accelerate the transition to low-carbon technologies and a budget of 100 million euros per year between 2020 and 2030.\n\nIn 2020, and in accordance with the Group's commitment to contribute  to  net  zero  carbon  by  2050,  Saint -Gobain published  a  roadmap  with  an  action  plan  and  intermediate targets for the end of 2030 (see section 3.3.3.B, p. 120).\n\n\u00cb\n\n## Integrating carbon impact into operational decision-making tools to accelerate the transition\n\nSince  2016,  Saint-Gobain  has  established  an  internal carbon price to assess the current or potential impact of a regulatory  carbon  price  on  Saint -Gobain's  activities, identify  opportunities  for  growth  in  low-carbon  sectors, refocusing  investments  in  manufacturing  and  R&D,  and prioritizing  actions  to  reduce  CO2  emissions.  The  Group has  set  two  levels  of  internal  carbon  prices.  The  first internal  carbon  price  level  per  metric  ton  is  applied  to industrial investments above, investments associated with a  change  in  energy  source,  energy  investments  on  an existing or greenfield site. The second carbon price level is used for R&D investment in breakthrough technology. This price  level  is  of  demonstrable  value  in  supporting  lowcarbon R&D projects.",

    {
        "page_content": "The  internal  carbon  price  levels  are  regularly  updated  in line with market trends and are applicable to all countries in  which  the  Group  operates.  Since  May  2023,  the  price level  applicable  to  investments  is  \u20ac100  per  metric  ton  of CO2 and \u20ac200 per metric ton for R&D projects. In addition, a  specific  approach  applicable  to  significant  acquisitions has been defined. It includes any effort required to ensure that  the  carbon  impact  of  this  acquisition  is  compatible with  Saint -Gobain's  direct  and  indirect  emissions  target trajectory.\n\nScope 1 and scope 2 emissions are measured on a monthly basis for nearly 90% of the Group's impact. This reporting is based on the production management. The management controllers are responsible for updating the information used to calculate scope 1, such as consumption  of  raw  material  or  energy.  PPA  (Purchase Power  Agreement)  contracts  are  updated  by  the purchasing teams and integrated into the reporting tools for monitoring scope 2.\n\nEmissions reduction performance is therefore an operational  performance  indicator  in  the  same  way  as financial performance indicators.\n\nThe  carbon  impact  is  also  integrated  into  the  processes for establishing annual  budgets  or  strategic  plans. Information on the carbon impact of planned investments is available to technical teams at sites and to the industrial departments of each business. Technical innovations such as investments in more mature technologies are identified according  to  their  cost,  technical  maturity  and  potential for reducing CO2 emissions.\n\nWhile the automation of the scope 3 calculation is more complex,  the  carbon  impact  by  more  than  80%  of industrial purchases (category 1) is measured automatically, and buyers have access to a dashboard to assess  the  impact  of  their  decision.  The  quality  of  the assessment  depends  above  all  on  the  quality  of  the information  provided  by  the  supplier  about  the  emission factors of materials and products. Similarly, the assessment of transport-related CO2 emissions (categories 4  and  9)  is  based  on  data  transmitted  by  operational logistics optimization systems.\n\nThis  effort  to  automate  and  improve  the  reliability  of scope  3  data  is  ongoin,  and  based  on  the  principle  of connecting to IT tools to monitor operational performance.\n\nUnder the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS),  the  rules  defining  the  free  allocation  of  carbon allowances from 2021 have been redefined.\n\nAt the end of the 2023 fiscal year, the Saint -Gobain Group had a stock of 3,6 million metric tons of greenhouse gas emission allowances allocated by the European Community. The Group considers that it will remain selfsufficient in allowances in for a minimum period of 4 years.\n\nA decarbonated home\n\n## Innovate to optimize industrial processes and promote the use of decarbonized energies\n\nIn  the  short  term,  the  actions  performed  involve  the reduction of energy consumption and, in the medium and long  term,  the  transition  to  the  use  of  decarbonized energy,  in particular the transition to the use  of decarbonized electricity. The WCM program (see section 2.3.3.A, p. 84) and the 'energy' and 'CO2' action plans for continuous  improvement  (see  section  2.3.3.B.b,  p.  117) provide structure for the action plans.\n\nShort- and medium-term actions also include investments in optimization and energy efficiency processes. Pragmatically, Saint -Gobain identifies and analyzes projects  for  which  rapid  gains  can  be  measured.  The analysis also takes into account the impact on competitiveness  and  applies  the  rules  related  to  the introduction of the internal carbon price. For example, the Group  promotes  the  installation  of  energy  and  heat recovery systems. These low-carbon solutions can address each of the impacts of industrial production: raw materials, energy  use,  energy  efficiency  and  energy  recovery,  and carbon capture and recovery.\n\nRegarding energy, processes that are technically adaptable  to  the  exclusive  use  of  electrical  energy  have been  identified.  For  these  processes,  the  transition  is facilitated by  the  development  of  local  renewable electricity  grids  and  the  growing  share  of  decarbonized electricity in national grids. Energy buyers have therefore been  involved  in  identifying  reliable  and  competitive sources  of  decarbonized  electricity  in  the  countries  in which Saint -Gobain operates. This transition to the use of decarbonized energies takes the form of investments such as in solar and wind farms, through the installation of solar panels on our sites or the use of market mechanisms such as  green  certificates  or  Power  Purchase  Agreements (PPAs).  At  the  Group  level,  the  share  of  decarbonized electricity in electricity consumption reached 57% in 2023.\n\nFor  processes  for  which  the  adaptation  to  the  exclusive use of electrical energy is technically more complex, two axes  of  innovation  are  then  deployed:  one  on  the development of decarbonized energies (biogas, biomethane or decarbonated hydrogen for example); and the other, to develop  processes  and  make  them compatible with an increasing use of  electricity.\n\nOverall, innovation is a lever used by the Group to reduce the  impact  of  its  activities.  Saint -Gobain  also  wants  to develop zero-emission productions for scopes 1 and 2 as quickly as possible. In May 2021 the Group announced an investment  of  \u20ac25  million  in  its  plasterboard  plant  at Fredrikstad,  Norway,  to  increase  its  production  capacity by around 40% and transform its plant into the first zerocarbon  emissions  production  of  plasterboard  site  in scopes 1 and 2 in the world thanks to a hydraulic power supply. Saint -Gobain receives a grant from the Norwegian government  agency  Enova;  the  new  facilities  have  been operational  since  April,  2023.  In  June  2022,  Saint-Gobain announced that it was investing in a second zero emission Scope  1  and  2  production  plant  in  Canada,  applying  the same technical solutions. The investment will be approximately 90 million Canadian dollars.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "A decarbonated home\n\nAt the same time, the Group has continued its efforts to develop 'net zero carbon' industrial process pilots (scopes 1  and  2)  or  very  low-emission.  Saint-Gobain  has  become the  first  manufacturer  to  set  up  a  low-pilot  zero-carbon production facility (scope 1 and 2) for flat glass at Aniche (France). This technical feat was achieved by using 100% recycled  glass  and  100%  energy  produced  from  biogas and decarbonized electricity (2) . Each Saint-Gobain industrial  process  has  established  a  net  zero  carbon production program (scopes 1 and 2) and conducted pilot production to test technical solutions.\n\n- To  support  this  effort  towards  industrial  processes contributing to carbon neutrality, a budget of \u20ac100 million per  year  has  been  allocated  to  Capex  and  research  and development investments for the next ten years. In 2023, Saint -Gobain has invested over \u20ac223 million to support its 2030 roadmap.\n\n## c.  Collaboration with stakeholders\n\nSaint-Gobain includes as a rule of lobbying or collaboration  the  adherence  of  partners  to  the  Group's values communicated in its code of ethics, the Principles of  Conduct  and  Action,  as  well  as  a  commitment  to support the Paris climate agreement.\n\n## Strong commitments to the climate\n\nSaint -Gobain  supports  the  implementation  of  ambitious political  frameworks  to  remove  technical  and  financial obstacles  and  accelerate  the  transition  to  a  low-carbon economy.  The  recovery  plans  initiated  by  governments following  the  Covid-19  crisis  are  an  opportunity  to combine the fight against climate change with economic development actions through such ways as initiatives that promote  building  renovation  and  energy  efficiency. Indeed,  decarbonization  of  construction  and  operation buildings  is  essential  to  achieve  the  greenhouse  gas emission reduction targets that governments have set for themselves.\n\nEuropean  regulatory  projects  related  to  sustainable finance and in particular taxonomy of sustainable activities are  essential  instruments  for  achieving  the  European Union's climate objectives, provided that they are guided by  scientific  criteria  and  developed  in  a  transparent manner.  The  Group  supports  the  work  of  the  European Commission  and  the  'sustainable  finance'  platform  to ensure that the ambition developed in the taxonomy and the  underlying  criteria  better  reflect  the  potential  and specificities of the business sectors concerned. However, a small  proportion  of  the  Group's  activities  have  been assessed and are therefore eligible.\n\nSaint -Gobain is fully committed as a non-state actor to the implementation  of  the  Paris  Agreement  and  participates with its  partners  in  the  subsequent  COP (Conferences of the  Parties)  on  climate  change.  At  COP28,  Saint-Gobain welcomed the \"Buildings Breakthrough\" initiative launched by  France  and  Morocco  as  part  of  the  Breakthrough Agenda  proposed  by  the  United  Kingdom  at  COP26  in Glasgow  in  2021.  The  goal  is  to  make  buildings  offering resilient  and  nearly  zero  greenhouse  gas  emissions  the norm for new buildings by 2030. This initiative builds on the  expertise  of  the  Global  Alliance  for  Buildings  and Construction (GABC), of which Saint-Gobain is a founding member.\n\n\u00cb\n\nIn  line  with  the  commitment  taken  to  contributing  to carbon  neutrality,  Saint -Gobain  has  been  involved  in  the 'Race to Zero' initiative since its creation, and in the 'We Mean Business' coalition, which now brings together more than 5,000 companies and 1,000 cities.\n\nTransforming  markets  also  means  changing  the  entire construction  market  value  chain.  The  Group  forges partnerships with many players who share the same desire to promote more sustainable buildings. In this respect, the Green Building Councils (GBC), a unique global network of national  associations  of  professionals  and  players  in  the construction  market,  are  an  essential  partner.  The  GBC network  offers  a  fast  path  for  the  deployment  of sustainable  construction  technologies  and  dissemination of  best  practices,  particularly  via  education  for  market players. It can create a collective momentum involving the various  stakeholders  (investors,  builders,  manufacturers, architects, etc.).\n\nGBCs have a geographical organization  that  allows  each Saint -Gobain entity, at the local, national, and international levels, to actively contribute to their work. The Group is a member of 40 local GBCs worldwide and a partner of the European network of GBCs (ERN) and serves as the vicechair of the Corporate Advisory Board of the World Green Building Council (WGBC).\n\nSaint -Gobain  is  committed  to  orienting  the  construction industry  towards  a  low-carbon  trajectory.  This  is  why Saint -Gobain is a founding member of the Global Alliance for  Buildings  and  Construction  (GABC).  Saint -Gobain  is also a member of the projects steering committee of the World  Business  Council  for  Sustainable  Development (WBCSD) for cities and buildings.\n\nSaint -Gobain  is  campaigning  for  the  introduction  of  a carbon  price.  This  price  must  allow  for  a  transition  that keeps  the  level  playing  field  between  the  various companies  and  countries,  in  particular  through  the establishment  of  a  mechanism  at  the  borders  of  Europe. Saint -Gobain  has  contributed  to  several  projects  on  the subject  at  the  European  level  within  the  ERT  (European Round  Table  for  Industry)  and  within  the  Afep  and  the Fabrique de l'Industrie in France. Saint -Gobain also joined the  steering  committee  of  the  World  Bank's  Carbon Pricing Leadership Coalition.\n\nSaint -Gobain  belongs  to  the  ETC  (Energy  Transition Commission),  a  group  of  about  fifty  leaders  from  the energy and climate community. Pierre-Andr\u00e9 de Chalendar is  one  of  the  commissioners.  The  aim  of  the  ETC  is  to accelerate the shift towards a low-carbon energy system that enables robust economic growth while limiting global warming  to  1.5\u00b0C.  Because  construction  is  its  primary market, the Group is particularly involved in the promotion of sustainable construction and is involved in initiatives to promote energy efficiency.\n\n## Train clients locally, inform the end user\n\nSome  of  the  training  courses  delivered  by  local  teams cover  energy  efficiency  and  reduction  of  environmental impact  of  buildings.  The  entity  of  tarde  materials  is particularly  active  in  that  area  and  plays  a  key  role  in supporting  craftsmen,  thereby  facilitating  the  marketing and use of sustainable products. These services set up by distribution  help  accelerate  the  transition  to  a  more sustainable construction and reduce the carbon impact of buildings.",

        "page_content": "In France, the Point.P network has launched an unprecedented  program  to  train  1,000  \"renovation assistance referents\" in 2023, who will be able to provide all the  necessary  information  and  advice  directly  to craftsmen in sales outlets.\n\nBuilding renovation programs in France rely on a network of trained, RGE-qualified craftsmen. Point.P has long been committed to increasing the skills of its craftsmen, and in particular  to  helping  them  obtain  this  qualification.  An educational  application  is  available  to  help  craftsmen prepare and practice for the exam. In addition, examination sessions are organized in branches supervised  by  employees  certified  by  the  Certibat inspection body. Saint-Gobain's other distribution banners in France have also joined the program.\n\nBy 2023, more than 5,000 craftsmen had logged on to the RGE application. They completed more than 27,000 test sessions. And nearly 400 craftsmen have been certified.\n\nBeyond  Building  Distribution,  training  structures  are offered by country. They are open to craftsmen, installers, architects and other actors of the construction sector.\n\n## Enhancing employee commitment\n\n## Training\n\nIn order for employees to be able to commit to the fight against  climate  change,  they  must  have  the  necessary keys to fully understand:\n\n- \u00b7 climate-related issues;\n- \u00b7 how to assess the impact of Saint -Gobain;\n- \u00b7 how to act to reduce its environmental footprint.\n\nA decarbonated home\n\n\"Climate  Academy\"  is  a  set  of  e-learning  courses  made available to Saint -Gobain employees to inform them about the  issues  related  to  the  risks  of  climate  change  and  to help them respond to environmental challenges, regardless of their level of expertise on the subject or their role in the company. The Climate Academy was conceived in two stages. The first one to understand, the impacts and challenges in the format of modules of no more than five minutes.  As  for  the  second  stage,  the  Climate  Academy presents  eight  themes  describing  the  various  means  of acting  to  protect  the  environment  and  contribute  to carbon neutrality in 2050.\n\nIn  addition  to  these  online  training  courses,  'Fresque  du climat' workshops are organized around the world. By the end of 2023, more than 3,400 employees had taken part in workshops. The aim is to train 80% of employees by the end of 2025.\n\n## An internal carbon fund for employees\n\nTo  engage  all  its  employees  on  the  road  to  the contribution  to  carbon  neutrality  by  2050,  and  to contribute  to  achieving  the  objective  of  reducing  the Group's  CO2  emissions  between  now  and  2030,  in  April 2021,  Saint -Gobain  launched  an  internal  'Carbon  Fund.' First  implemented  in  a  pilot  region,  Northern  Europe,  it aims  to  accelerate  the  reduction  of  non-industrial  CO2 emissions  through  the  daily  actions  of  employees  and targeted investments in sites. The areas covered by these investments are mainly related to the sustainable mobility of employees, renewable energies and the improvement of comfort and energy efficiency at Saint -Gobain sites. These projects  proposed  and  selected  by  employees  mainly concern their working environment. Organizational methods,  thematic  choices  and  priorities  are  defined  by local organizations.\n\n## 3.3.2 RISKS, OPPORTUNITIES AND SOLUTIONS\n\nThe challenges related  to  climate  change  represent  both risks  and  opportunities  for  Saint -Gobain.  The  system  for identifying, assessing and managing global and local risks is  detailed  in  Saint -Gobain's response to the CDP climate questionnaire. In this area, the Group follows the principles of due diligence. This process allows us to identify, prevent and  mitigate  actual  and  potential  negative  impacts associated with its business and supply chain, as well as to report on how these impacts are addressed.\n\n## A - Risks and opportunities across the value chain\n\nThe identification and assessment of risks and opportunities related to climate change is an integral part of  Saint -Gobain's global risk management and innovation processes. As such, the Group has identified ten risks and five  strategic  opportunities  related  to  climate  change. Each  risk  and  opportunity  affects  each  segment  of  the Saint -Gobain's value chain differently, from the extraction of raw materials to their end of life. The tables below show how the opportunities and risks identified by Saint -Gobain impact each stage of the value chain while being part of global market dynamics and meeting consumer expectations.  This  approach  has  also  been  aligned  with TCFD  recommendations.  The  identified  risks  are  not  of significant financial materiality to the Group.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Risks related to climate change\n\n## Physical risks\n\nThe three major physical risks identified on the basis of the sixth IPCC report are increased frequency and/or intensity of  potentially  destructive  events,  resource  scarcity  and global temperature increase.\n\nThe Risk and Insurance Department continuously assesses the risks to which the Group's sites are exposed worldwide and, in particular, the risks related to the effects of climate change  (see  section  3.2.2.A.a,  p.  99).  In  2022,  a  specific study  of  the  exposure  of  the  main  sites  was  conducted. These  risks  are  then  managed  by  the  sites  concerned,\n\nwhich draw up and implement action plans to reduce their risk  exposure  updating  business  continuity  plans  to  take account  of  climatic  risks..  The  technical  and  industrial performance  department,  in  particular  the  industrial  and R&D  departments  of  each  activity,  coordinates  actions involving changes to industrial processes or plant design.\n\nIn addition, the Group ensures that physical risks are taken into  account  throughout  its  value  chain.  As  part  of  its responsible purchasing program, Saint -Gobain relies on a diversity of suppliers and supply sources to reduce the risk of transportation difficulties and supply chain disruptions. Lastly, the Purchasing Department considers the risk of an increase  in  the  price  of  raw  materials  or  of  energy  and greenhouse gas emissions in its purchasing strategies.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Two internal carbon prices were set up in 2016 to  support  the  viability  of  Saint -Gobain's  projects  and strategy (see section 3.3.1.B.b, p. 110). These two prices are regularly updated.\n\nAt  the  local  level,  monitoring  and  compliance  programs have  been  implemented  in  the  countries  coordinated  by the EHS  Department,  while  the  Legal  Department monitors  new  environmental  regulations.  In  addition,  the marketing teams ensure that the Group's products comply with local environmental regulations. Similarly, the risks of\n\n\u00cb\n\nclimate  change  disputes  are  assessed  as  part  of  the existing risk management process. Saint -Gobain monitors changes  in  climate  reporting  requirements  in  order  to meet the expectations of its stakeholders.\n\nWhat is more, aware of the impact of a bad reputation on environmental matters, the Group fully integrates reputational risk into its risk management  policy. Saint -Gobain  is  demonstrating  its  commitment  to  the climate  through  concrete  targets  for  reducing  its  CO2 emissions and energy consumption. Finally, the needs and risks  related  to  access  to  water  for  local  populations  are also taken into account in its action plans.",

The substitution  of  non-renewable  virgin  raw  materials  with renewable or recycled raw materials, the extension of the lifespan  or  use  of  our  products  or  systems  and  the reduction of the intensity of materials are at the heart of the Group's innovation process and enable it to ensure the competitiveness of its solutions while anticipating changes in the preferences of its end consumers and legislation.\n\nSaint -Gobain  is  also  working  to  optimize  and  reduce  its energy  consumption  through  such  means  as  investing  in digital  tools  to  adjust  energy  consumption  as  closely  as possible to needs..\n\nAnticipation  of  the  increase  in  the  cost  of  high-emission products, which would follow the tightening of regulations and  the  change  in  preferences  expected  by  consumers and  clients,  encourages  Saint -Gobain  to  support  the development  of  low-carbon  materials  and  methods throughout  its  value  chain.  In  addition  to  its  efforts  to contribute to carbon neutrality in its operations, the Group promotes  renewable  energies  and  develops  solutions  to improve the energy efficiency of its clients to enable them to  meet  the  climate  and  environmental  challenges  they face  (see  section  3.2.3.C,  p.  104).  Thanks  to  its  strong exposure  to  the  renovation  market,  the  Group  is  ideally situated  to  play  a  decisive  role  in  the  national  and European 'green recovery' plans for the energy transition, which should support Saint -Gobain's structural growth.\n\n## c.  Study of the amplification effects of risks and opportunities according to the climate scenarios\n\nAs part of the analysis of its exposure to physical risks and transition risks and opportunities, studies were conducted in  2022  and  2023  to  identify  the  potential  amplification effects  of  transition  risks  due  to  the  intensity  of  physical risks, including their financial impacts. The objective of this exercise is to provide the Group with a global and regional view  of  its  exposure  to  the  risks  and  opportunities associated  with  the  impact  of  climate  change  on  its business  as  well  as  the  integration  of  potential  financial effects into its financial statements.\n\nAn identification of the evolution of major physical risksglobally and by region-was carried out on the basis of the sixth IPCC report. These physical risks were then linked to the transition risks and  opportunities  identified by Saint -Gobain and aligned with the TCFD recommendations.  For  each  of  them,  the  potential amplification  effect  caused  by  the  physical  risks  was studied  and  quantified  as  low,  moderate  or  significant according  to  three  scenarios:  SSP1-2.6,  SSP2-4.5  and SSP5-8.5.\n\nThe three major physical risks identified on the basis of the IPCC  report  are  increased  frequency  and/or  intensity  of potentially  destructive  events,  resource  scarcity,  and global temperature increase. In the SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5 scenarios,  these  three  physical  risks  have  expected amplification  effects  on  the  majority  of  transition  risks  in all  regions.  On  the  other  hand,  a  particular  influence  on market  risks  is  observed,  such  as  the  increase  in production and distribution costs or the disruption of the value chain. This can be explained by various reasons, such as  an  increase  in  production  costs  linked  to  rising temperatures,  which  increases  the  energy  requirements for cooling machines.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Indeed,  the  global  rise  in temperatures could accelerate the evolution of regulations related  to  building  insulation,  thus  favoring  demand.  In addition,  Saint -Gobain's  ability  to  develop  construction alternatives  that  are  more  energy  efficient  and  have  a lower environmental impact could represent an opportunity amplified by the increasing scarcity of certain resources,  making  it  possible  to  reduce  their  additional cost.\n\nIn  2023,  an  initial  estimate  of  the  financial  impact  of climate  change  was  made.  The  analysis  includes  three levels of impact:\n\n- \u00b7 direct impacts: the immediate effects of climate change on  the  sites,  infrastructure  and  living  and  working conditions;\n- \u00b7 indirect  impacts:  the  consequences  of  the  effects  of climate  change  on  economic  activity,  the  financial statements,  as  well  as  the  social  impact,  including  the impact of business interruptions;\n- \u00b7 potential adaptation measures to reduce the vulnerability  of  the  sites,  including  cost,  feasibility  and ease of implementation.\n\nThis  study  confirms  that  the  identified  risks  are  not  of significant  financial  materiality  to  the  Group.  (see  section 8.1, note 3, p. 307).\n\nAt  the  same  time,  a  financial  assessment  approach  was initiated  for  opportunities  related  to  physical  risks.  It  is based on:\n\n- \u00b7 an analysis of the impact of the main climate risks on Saint-Gobain's  markets,  in  particular  construction  and renovation;\n- \u00b7 an  estimate  of  potential  demand  growth  for  the Group's solutions.\n\nSaint -Gobain's  knowledge  of  the  existence  of  these amplification  effects  enables  it  to  include  physical  risks and  transition  risks  and  opportunities  in  its  long-term vision  and  strategy,  thus  fully  integrating  climate  change and its impacts into its decision-making.\n\n## C - Solutions\n\n## a.  Designing innovative solutions incorporating 'carbon benefits'\n\nSaint -Gobain is  innovating  to  develop  solutions  to  reduce the carbon footprint of buildings throughout their life cycle:\n\n- \u00b7 by  reducing  their  energy  consumption  during  the utilization  phase;  these  are  insulation  and  glazing solutions that improve energy efficiency;\n- \u00b7 by  reducing  the  carbon  footprint  of  its  products  and solutions, particularly by developing lightweight construction solutions, increasing the amount  of recycled  materials  used  to  manufacture  them  or  by using renewable  energy  to  power  its  industrial processes.\n- \u00b7 by reducing the carbon footprint of building materials thanks  to  innovative  solutions  developed  by  the building chemistry sector.\n\nAn  online  platform  called  Green  Buildings  Saint -Gobain enables the Group's clients to evaluate the contribution of its  products  and  solutions  to  obtaining  LEED,  BREEAM, WELL or international HQE certifications.\n\nEnergy  efficiency  and  reducing  the  carbon  footprint  of products are two criteria incorporated into the methodology for  evaluating  sustainable  solutions  as  part of the program (see section 3.2.3.C, p. 118).\n\n## b.  Measuring the 'carbon benefits' of products and solutions\n\nThe  innovative  solutions  developed  by  Saint -Gobain  to improve  the  energy  efficiency  of  buildings  lessen  the negative impacts of the building and construction sector on  the  climate  and  cut  occupants'  energy  bills,  while enhancing  well-being.  They  therefore  play  an  important role  in  the  fight  against  climate  change,  as  they  allow through  a  reduction  of  energy  demand  to  decrease  the quantity  of  greenhouse  gases  emitted.  The  Group's thermal  insulation  and  insulating  glass  solutions  provide benefits in terms of energy performance and greenhouse gas  emissions  that  significantly  outweigh  the  carbon footprint associated with their production.\n\nSince 2015, Saint -Gobain regularly updates the methodology used to calculate the quantity of greenhouse gases  avoided  thanks  to  the  use  of  its  own  solutions  in order to:\n\n- \u00b7 comply with the most recent and recognized international  recommendations  for  the  calculation  of prevented greenhouse gas emissions;\n- \u00b7 extend the geographic coverage of the assessment;\n- \u00b7 update the operating conditions of the buildings taken into account,  such  as  the  heating  systems,  the distribution of energy used and the associated emission factors, and the efforts made to renovate the stocks.\n\nSaint -Gobain has estimated that nearly 1,300 million metric tons  of  emissions  was  avoided  thanks  to  the  solutions produced and sold in one year in 2020 throughout their entire life cycle.. The updated methodology is available to all stakeholders on  the  Saint -Gobain  website.  This calculation  has  been  reviewed  by  an  independent  third party.\n\nSaint -Gobain is committed to promoting life cycle analyses (LCA) to better understand and control the environmental impacts  of  its  products.  These  analyses  are  useful  for guiding innovation, better informing clients and responding  to  growing  market  demand  for  greater transparency. Saint -Gobain is committed to ensuring that, by 2030, 100% of the Group's sales, excluding distribution activities,  will  be  generated  by  products  covered  by verified LCAs (life cycle analyses) or EPDs (environmental product  declarations).  At  the  end  of  2023,  53,5%  of revenue was generated with products covered by LCAs or verified EPDs,\n\nThis represents more than 2,600 verified EPDs published in more than 40 countries, the Group is positioned as the world's leading provider of verified EPDs - by number - in the construction sector.",

Co-developing solutions for new markets linked to the low-carbon economy\n\nIn  response  to  the  challenges  of  population  growth  and urbanization, it is imperative  to  design  sustainable solutions  and  contribute  to  the  construction  of  resilient cities that ensure the well-being of individuals in a context of resource scarcity and climate change. New lightweight construction  methods  can  be  used  to  meet  these challenges. The development of prefabricated solutions or 'off-site' construction favors the use of lighter construction methods using wood or metal structures, as alternatives to traditional constructions based on cement and brick. Saint -Gobain is also investing in 3D printing.\n\nAmong  the many solutions developed, innovative solutions  based  on  high-performance  ceramics  help  to reduce carbon emissions and energy consumption in glass furnaces. But beyond construction, the high-performance solutions developed by the Group also improve hydrogen transport  and  the  fire  resistance  of  batteries  for  electric vehicles.  In  Construction  Chemicals,  Saint-Gobain  has entered into a partnership with Ecocem to market binder, concrete and mortar solutions with a low carbon footprint.\n\nThe transition to a low-carbon economy is also impacting markets  related  to  mobility  and  energy.  Thus,  the 'Mobility'  Business  Unit  is  working  both  on  solutions  to support clients in the transition to vehicles that emit less and less CO2 and on adapting its offer to the development of hybrid or 100% electric vehicles.\n\n## D - Toward a just transition\n\nThe  transition  to  a  more  sustainable  construction  and industry  mainly  requires  technological  developments,  the systematic integration of carbon impact into professional and  personal  decision-making,  the  development  of  a circular  economy  and  the  availability  of  decarbonized energy.\n\nThe transformation of Saint-Gobain's industrial  processes as part of the implementation of its 2030 carbon roadmap (see  section  3.3.3.B,  p.  120)  does  not  entail  any  major changes  in  the  professions  or  organization  of  industrial sites.  The training programs set up by the Group already anticipate  this  transition  (see  section  2.3.2.C.b,  p.  81),  in particular those aimed at:\n\n- \u00b7 ensure efficiency and operational excellence;\n- \u00b7 accelerate digital transformation in operations, business models and skills.\n\nIn  addition  to  changes  in  the  Group's  businesses  and organization,  Saint-Gobain  employees  are  trained  in  the challenges and urgency of climate change either through e-learning courses at the Climate Academy or face-to-face training at the Climate Fresco (see section 3.3.1.B.c, p. 112).\n\nA decarbonated home\n\nBeyond  the  Group's  perimeter,  achieving  its  carbon emissions  reduction  targets  (\"scope\"  1,  2,  3)  requires product  formulations  to  incorporate  low-carbon  impact raw materials, in particular recycled materials (see section 3.4, p. 124).\n\nThis  means  creating  new  channels  for  the  collection  and processing of construction waste, with the emergence of new business models. These industries create jobs,  often for  low-skilled  workers.  In  some  countries,  they  are  also opportunities  to  create  jobs  for  vulnerable  and  excluded people. In France, for example, the social economy is a key player  in  glass  and  wood  recycling.  The  Saint-Gobain Foundation  supports  work-integration  projects  linked  to the emergence of more circular ecosystems.\n\nDeveloping  sustainable  construction  to  accelerate  the sector's  contribution  to  carbon  neutrality  requires  a  shift to  new  construction  methods,  in  particular  lightweight construction,  the  renovation  of  existing  buildings  to improve  energy  efficiency,  and  the  provision  of  lowcarbon solutions and products.\n\nRenovation  plans  to  improve  the  energy  efficiency  of buildings  have  an  undeniable  effect  not  only  on  carbon emissions, but also on end-users' energy bills. This is all the more  important  for  people  in  fragile  or  financially precarious situations. The Build Change program launched in 2022 identifies and promotes actions taken by countries in  favor  of  social  housing.  The  Saint-Gobain  Foundation also  supports  employee  initiatives  to  promote  access  to decent housing for excluded people.\n\nTo  achieve  the  sector's  goal  of  contributing  to  carbon neutrality, access  to  a  skilled  workforce  trained  in sustainable  construction  solutions  will  be  decisive  in  all countries. The programs set up by Saint-Gobain's country organizations  to  support  craftsmen  in  training  their employees (see section 3.3.1.B.c, p. 112) contribute to this transition.  Similarly,  vocational  training  programs  (see section  3.3.1.B.c,  p.  112)  anticipate  the  growing  need  for renovation and new construction.\n\nSaint-Gobain's  ambition  to  decouple  its  growth  from  its scope 1,  2  and  3  carbon  emissions  will  enable  it  to  meet the  growing  demand  from  the  building  and  construction markets while controlling the sector's impact.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Saint -Gobain participates  in  these  debates.  The  Group  is  also  keen  to engage in dialog with expert organizations with a view to improving the measurement of impacts in order to make the fight against climate change more effective.\n\nSaint -Gobain  has  set  targets  and  implemented  a  set  of indicators to monitor its climate change performance. The carbon-related targets are detailed in the 'Carbon 2030' roadmap.\n\nThe Group has set up a monthly review of its scope 1 and scope 2 emissions to integrate the carbon impact into its management tools.\n\nIn  2023,  Saint -Gobain's  CO2  for  scope  1  and  2  emissions were estimated at 8.8 million metric tons.\n\nScope  3  emissions  are  indirect  emissions  that  are generated  in  a  company's  value  chain.  Given  the complexity  of  the  value  chains,  the  assessment  of emissions  is  a  challenge,  and  the  improvement  of  data quality  is  essential  in  the  context  of  the  commitment towards contributing to net zero emissions in the sector. For this reason, Saint -Gobain's updated scope 3 emissions assessment  in  2021  has  been  accompanied  by  a  more specific  assessment  of  emissions  factors  and  a  more granular analysis of impacts on the three most significant categories, representing more than 80% of total scope 3 emissions.\n\nThis  effort  continued  first  and  foremost  thanks  to  the creation  of  digital  tools  to  facilitate  evaluations  of categories  1,  4  and  9  in  particular.  A  database  was  also created to monitor the emission factors of materials and products  purchased  by  the  Group.  The  ideal  and  most reliable way is to obtain from suppliers a life cycle analysis of the materials and products they have delivered to the Group. If this information is not available, the assessment is  based  on  recognized  database  values  such  as  Gabi  or EcoInvent.\n\nAt the end of 2022, scope 3 emissions were estimated at 20 million metric tons considered within the framework of the 2030 target validated by SBTi.\n\nDetails  of  scope  3  emissions  for  each  category  are published  in  the  CDP  questionnaire  available  on  the Saint -Gobain website.\n\nThe classification of Saint -Gobain's activities in the context of  the  European  regulation  on  sustainable  finance  and compliance  with  the  European  regulation  '2020/852 Taxonomy  Regulation'  (in  force  since  July  2020),  the delegated  acts  to  the  first  two  objectives  regarding climate  change  mitigation  and  adaptation  -  'Taxonomy Climate  Delegated  Act  (EU)  2021/2139  -  as  well  as  the delegated  act  to  Article  8  of  Regulation  (EU)  2020/852 and  its  annexes  on  reporting  requirements  ('Disclosures Delegated Act') is disclosed in section 9.3.5, p. 424.\n\nThe  proportion  of  Saint -Gobain's  revenue  linked  to sustainable  solutions  is  estimated  at  73%  in  2023 in  line with the target of 75% by 2025. It includes activities that\n\n\u00cb\n\nhave not been assessed in the context of compliance with the  European  Taxonomy  Regulation  2020/852,  such  as trade activities, and impacts and benefits that have not yet been included in the regulation, such as resources and the circular  economy,  as  well  as  benefits  related  to  health, safety  and  comfort,  which  will  potentially  be  eligible  for the social taxonomy.\n\nAll other objectives and indicators that the Group uses to make  progress  in  mitigating,  managing  and  adapting  to climate change issues are presented in a detailed table in chapter  4.  The  2030  targets  based  on  2017  have  been validated by the independent organization Science-Based Target  initiative  (SBTi).  Details  of  the  methodology  for calculating  the  indicators  and  targets  are  available  in section 9.2.1, p. 410.\n\n## B - 2030 roadmap\n\nIn 2020,  SBTi  validated  Saint -Gobain's  2030  target: 8.49 million metric tons of CO2 for scope 1 and 2 in 2030, i.e.,  a  33%  reduction in absolute terms between 2017 and 2030  and  a  16%  reduction  in  scope  3  over  the  same period.  By  the  end  of  2023,  the  group  had  reduced  its emissions  by  34%  on  scope  1  and  2  since  2017.  This absolute  target  reflects  the  ambition  to  decouple  CO2 emissions from production growth.\n\nTo  achieve  the  goal  of  zero  net  emissions  by  2050, Saint -Gobain is acting on three main levels:\n\n- \u00b7 transition  to  carbon-neutral  production,  which  implies the consumption of low-carbon energies;\n- \u00b7 evolution of products  and  their  composition,  in particular to include more recycled materials;\n- \u00b7 logistical  resources  combining  route  optimization  and low-impact transport methods.\n\nThe  scope  3  impact  of  Saint -Gobain's  activities is concentrated on the three most significant categories:\n\n- \u00b7 Purchases  of  raw  materials  (category  1)  and  energy (category 3);\n- \u00b7 Transport and logistics (categories 4 and 9);\n- \u00b7 Purchases related to trade activities (category 1).\n\nEach country is responsible for its own roadmap. Each year's financial budgets include an assessment of carbon emission reductions  based  on  planned  investments.  The  carbon roadmap  is  supported  by  a  CAPEX  and  R&D  investment plan of at least 100 million euros per year until 2030.\n\nBy 2023, 223 million euros of CAPEX and R&D related to the carbon roadmap had been invested.\n\n## a.  Reducing emissions related to scope 1 and 2\n\nThe success of this roadmap requires the involvement of everyone  and  a  change  of  mentality.  Carbon  reduction objectives  are  included  in  all  operational  processes:  the WCM  program  for  ongoing  productivity  efforts,  energy purchases that include securing supplies of decarbonized energies  (renewable  electricity  or  biogas,  for  example), and  increased  use  of  recycled  materials,  which  involves the development of collection channels in all countries or evolution of products  through  ecodesign  (such  as lightening, optimizing packaging and reducing the impact of transport).",

        "page_content": "A decarbonated home\n\nThe 2030 roadmap relies on four main levers to reduce scope 1 and 2:\n\n- \u00b7 actions on products (A): product optimization and eco-design, including recycling efforts and integration of recycled materials;\n- \u00b7 industrial excellence (B): industrial process improvements and productivity efforts;\n- \u00b7 innovation (C): pillars of new technologies and new compositions;\n- \u00b7 use of decarbonized energies (D).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Actions on products (A)\n\nDrawing  on  the  expertise  of  our  central  teams,  our countries  develop  and  optimize  a  portfolio  of  solutions tailored  to  market  needs,  local  construction  techniques and customer expectations, right through to the end-user. Priority  is  given  to  assessing  ways  of  making  products lighter,  optimizing  packaging  to  reduce  the  impact  of logistics, or integrating recycled materials.\n\nSeveral  countries  have  already  deployed  the  BANTAM program, aimed at making plasterboard lighter by working on  industrial  processes  and  product  formulations.  As  a result, some plants have been able to reduce the weight of their standard  plasterboard  products  by  over  20% compared  with  their initial weight, for equivalent performance.\n\nThe SLIMWOOL program, rolled out worldwide since 2018, aims  to  optimize  the  weight  of  glass  wool,  while guaranteeing the product's thermal performance.\n\nFinally, when  raw  materials  emit  CO2  during  the production  phase,  the  integration  of  recycled  glass  to replace virgin raw materials enables significant reductions in  scope  1  carbon  impact.  This  is  the  case  for  glass production.  Replacing  one  tonne  of  composition  with  its equivalent in cullet (recycled glass) reduces emissions by 300kg of CO2 for one tonne of cullet replacing the virgin composition (1) .\n\nThese  measures  can  be  accompanied  by  awarenessraising campaigns  for  customers  and  end-users  if perception barriers are identified.\n\n(1)\n\n## Industrial excellence (B)\n\nThe WCM industrial excellence program (see section 2.3.3, p.  77)  is  at  the  heart  of  the  2030  carbon  roadmap. Through its actions on productivity and energy efficiency, environmental  performance  is  combined  with  economic performance.\n\nThe  deployment  of  digital  technologies  and  the  use  of data have profoundly transformed the organization of the Group's factories: machines are increasingly connected in real  time,  and  data  analysis  enables  better  control  of production  processes,  faster  resolution  of  any  technical issues and, more generally, greater operational efficiency. Plant  engineers  use  data  to  better  understand  the complex dynamics of manufacturing lines, enabling them to  better  control  industrial  processes  and  thus  improve efficiency, deploy predictive maintenance approaches, and also  reduce  variability,  defects,  waste,  energy  and  raw material consumption, and the production of greenhouse gases.  This  represents  an  essential  lever  for  progress towards the Group's objectives in terms of decarbonization and circularity.\n\nWith production units where software tools and machine tools  interact  directly,  numerous  applications  are  made possible:  real-time  monitoring  of  production,  automatic alert systems, predictive maintenance or even optimization  of  product  quality  by  reducing  both  costs and  the  quantity  of  resources  and  energy  used.  For example,  the  Construction  Industry  Business  Unit  uses artificial intelligence-based  software  to  optimize  the operation of its fiberglass furnaces.\n\n<!-- image -->",

At  our  plasterboard  plants,  for  example,  the deployment of sensors and detailed real-time data analysis have enabled us to precisely control gas combustion using an algorithm that adapts the intensity of the dryers.\n\nLastly, the Group's plants are adapting to the increase in the  quantity  of  recycled  materials  in  their  composition through  investments,  notably  in  raw  materials  storage areas,  compounding  workshops,  and  even  the  industrial processes themselves.\n\nThe  action  plans  and  investments  made  to  increase  the availability and quality of recycled materials are presented in  the  \"More  performance  with  less\"  section  of  this chapter.\n\n## Innovation (C)\n\nTo ensure the transition towards productions contributing to carbon neutrality, Saint -Gobain relies on its R&D teams to  devise  industrial  processes.  Since  2021,  programs  and demonstrators  have  been  set  up  in  most  of  the  Group's businesses: gypsum, glass and insulation.\n\nAlready,  the  first  gypsum  plants  designed  to  emit minimum  levels  of  carbon  are  being  invested  in  Norway and Canada.\n\nA pilot production run of zero-emission (\"scope\" 1 and 2) flat  glass  was  also  carried  out  in  France  in  May  2022. Following  this  successful  trial,  a  'low-carbon'  glass  offer has  been  proposed  to  the  market  in  Europe.  This  new range,  called  Ora\u00e9\u00ae,  has  a  low-carbon  footprint  with  a reduction  of  around  40%  compared  with  the  European average.\n\nThis technical feat was made possible by an R&D program launched  in  2022,  drawing  on  the  Group's  extensive expertise in  combustion, glass quality, refractory ceramic materials  and  industrial  furnace  design.  The  program  in question  is  being  conducted  in  collaboration  with  the independent  German  laboratory  Gas  and  Heat  Institute Essen e.V. (GWI), a specialist in industrial gas technologies, and  financially  supported  by  the  state  of  North  RhineWestphalia, to the tune of 3.64 million euros.\n\nAnalysis of the data from these tests will enable the use of hydrogen  in  the  Group's  floats  to  be  deployed  in  the decades  to  come,  when  low-carbon  hydrogen  will  be available in sufficient quantities.\n\n## Use of decarbonized energies (D)\n\nMore  than  three  quarters  of  Saint -Gobain's  total  energy consumption is directly linked to purchases of fossil fuels. The  ability  of  industrial  processes  to  move  from  using fossil  fuels  to  decarbonized  energy  solutions  -  electricity (when  it  is  low-carbon),  biogas,  or  even  hydrogen  -  is therefore  crucial.  Action  plans  have  been  drawn  up\n\n\u00cb\n\nbetween the non-trade purchasing teams in the countries, the  Industrial  Departments  and  the  local  environmental managers, in order to identify regular and reliable sources of renewable  energy.  Decarbonized  electricity now accounts for more than half of all electricity consumption.\n\nThe  Group  is  also  developing  projects  on  its  sites  using new energies (wind energy, biomass, biogas, solar energy, etc.).  These  developments  may  be  made  in  association with external partners.\n\n## b.  Reducing scope 3 emissions\n\nThe deployment of the 2030 carbon roadmap includes the \"scope\" 3 reduction target. The first step is to improve the identification  and  measurement  of  impacts,  while  raising awareness among internal players, in particular buyers and logistics experts, and external partners, primarily suppliers.\n\nActions are taken in each of the 15 categories according to the materiality of their impact.\n\nThree  categories  are  crucial  to  achieving  the  reduction target:\n\n- \u00b7 category 1: purchasing ;\n- \u00b7 categories 4 and 9: transport.\n\nWith regard to category 3 (energy-related emissions not included in \"scopes\" 1 and 2), efforts to reduce fossil fuel consumption and promote the use of low-carbon energy sources  will  have  a  positive  impact  on  the  reduction  of scope 3 emissions.\n\nWith regard to category 6 relating to business travel, the travel policy was updated in 2023 to:\n\n- \u00b7 control  and  significantly  reduce  the  number  of  trips, especially international ones;\n- \u00b7 systematically review the advisability of postponing or transforming  seminars  or  other  meetings  into  virtual meetings;\n- \u00b7 travel by train is mandatory for all journeys of less than 4 hours.\n\nThe  impact  of  category  11,  which  relates  to  the  use  of products sold, is concentrated on two activities: the sale of windscreens by the mobility business, and the sale of airconditioning  and  heating  equipment  by  the  heating equipment  retail  chains.  For  each  of  these  activities,  the Group's direct influence on the reduction in this category is  limited.  Nevertheless,  Mobility  Business  Unit  teams  are developing specific products for electric vehicles, and are involved  in  their  customers'  action  plans  for  sustainable mobility.  Similarly,  the  purchasing  teams  of  our  retail banners  work  with  their  suppliers  to  reduce  the  carbon impact  of  heating  during  the  building's  use  phase.  The banners  also  contribute  to  the  drive  to  transform  the construction industry by training craftsmen and informing users (see section 3.3.1.B.c, p. 112).",

        "page_content": "## Purchasing actions to reduce scope 3 category 1:\n\nFive principles are implemented by the purchasing teams and environmental experts:\n\n- \u00b7 A digital tool available to teams at local levels and by categories  to  enable  them  to  estimate  scope  3 emissions;\n- \u00b7 Communication kits to share the challenges and targets of the fight against climate change with suppliers;\n- \u00b7 The  collection  of  information  by  suppliers  on  their emissions on the basis of life cycle analyses verified by independent third parties;\n- \u00b7 The  integration  of  the  maturity  of  suppliers  regarding their  climate  commitment  into  the  overall  assessment of their performance;\n- \u00b7 The  creation  of  joint  action  plans  with  suppliers  to reduce their carbon impact.\n\nThis  systematization  will  continue  to  make  scope  3 assessments more reliable. It  also  structures  action  plans to  accelerate  the  reduction  of  emissions.  Best  practices have been identified and shared with all Group buyers.\n\nAll  over  the  world  and  for  all  Business  Units,  supplier awareness-raising  initiatives  have  been  carried  out  using formats  adapted  to  each  business,  in  particular  the organization of awareness days or webinars incorporating question-and-answer  sessions.  Digital  technology  is  also changing  the  way  we  interact  with  suppliers.  Digitizing supplier  processes  means  centralizing  the  purchasing department, and automating tasks using new online tools, including  the  possibility  of  integrating  carbon  impact questions right from the tender stage. These digital tools also  facilitate  the  formalization  of  supplier  commitments to  reduce  their  \"scopes\"  1,  2  and  3  emissions,  including medium-term  objectives  aligned  with  a  1.5\u00b0C  trajectory. These tools can also be used to share action plans.\n\nInnovation  programs  are  also  underway  to  identify  ways of replacing the most impacting raw materials, either with recycled  materials  or  by  proposing  new  low-carbon compositions.\n\nA decarbonated home\n\n## Logistics and transport initiatives (categories 4 and 9)\n\nOptimizing  logistics  (see  section  3.2.1.  B,  p.  97),  both upstream  and  downstream  of  the  value  chain,  is  a  key factor  in  achieving  the  objective  of  reducing  Scope  3 emissions by 2030. The Group has equipped itself with a central  tool  for  measuring,  analyzing  and  challenging  the carbon footprint of its activities. This tool is deployed by country and activity.\n\nIn  partnership  with  logistics  service  providers,  the  Group favors the use of vehicles that comply with EURO V and VI emission  standards,  or  promotes  the  transition  to  loweremission fuels for the fleet.\n\nSaint-Gobain is committed to using transport modes in an agile way, switching to less polluting multimodal transport modes,  such  as  rail  and  river  or  sea  transport,  wherever possible.  Numerous  actions  have  been  taken,  such  as Point.P's initiatives in France to develop river transport in the Paris region. For example, the Quai de Javel branch in Paris  receives  deliveries  by  barge,  thus  avoiding  truck traffic.\n\n## C - Towards zero net emissions by 2050\n\nSaint-Gobain's  medium- and long-term growth ambitions require a reduction in carbon intensity.\n\nAs  the  2030  roadmap  is  rolled  out,  new  medium-term absolute  targets  may  be  defined.  These  targets  will  be aligned with the Paris Agreement, in line with the Group's commitment.\n\nA  new  roadmap  will  be  defined.  It  will  incorporate  the technical  advances  identified  thanks  to  the  innovation efforts made over the period 2020-2030.\n\nThe development of a circular economy in all countries is present and is also a determining factor in achieving the reduction target for \"scopes\" 1 and 3.\n\nThe  availability  of  decarbonized  and  economically  viable energy  in  sufficient  quantities  will  be  an  indispensable element  in  achieving  zero  net  emissions  by  2050.  This applies to energy production and distribution. Transporting  energy  and  connecting  sites  are  decisive elements to be included in the roadmap.\n\nThe associated financial resources will also be assessed.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Circularity combined with an efficient and reasoned use of resources makes  it  possible  to  face  the  sustainable  development issues,  in  particular  the  fight  against  climate  change, biodiversity and pollution. For example, a study published by  the  World  Economic  Forum  in  December  2023 indicates that the circularity of materials can contribute to a  reduction  of  around  75%  in  emissions  linked  to  the\n\nMore performance with less\n\nmaterials used in the construction of a building by 2050, while creating significant economic value.\n\nDeveloping circularity is applied closer to markets and at country and regional level. A successful transition towards the  circular  economy  will  make  it  possible  to  offer solutions and services over the long term which take into account  environmental,  social  and  societal  expectations and which balance well-being, sustainability and performance for stakeholders. Saint -Gobain is actively and collaboratively involved in discussions on the evolution of construction  methods  towards  lightweight  construction solutions  that  use  fewer  materials  for  at  least  the  same performance. In this way, the Group is participating in the transformation  of  the  sector  towards  more  sustainable construction in all the countries where it operates.\n\n## 3.4.1 STRATEGY FOR A TRANSITION TOWARDS A CIRCULAR ECONOMY\n\nSaint-Gobain's  strategy  is  to  preserve  natural  resources and  the  environment  throughout  its  value  chain  and  to offer  products  and  solutions  that  can  be  reused  or recycled  and  have  a  longer  lifespan,  thus  avoiding  the extraction  of  virgin  raw  materials  and  maintaining  the value of resources at their highest level.\n\nIt focuses on three objectives:\n\n- \u00b7 Reduce  pressure  on  natural  raw  materials,  especially exhaustible resources, across the value chain;\n- \u00b7 Optimize the use of resources from their extraction to their  end  of  life:  minimize  the  generation  of  nonrecovered waste at each stage of the life cycle of the solutions:\n- \u00b7 Accelerate the transition to a circular model: implement local materials collection channels, initiate or participate in  partnerships  with  all  players  in  the  value  chain (suppliers, customers,  specifiers, end-users, public authorities,  etc.)  in  order  to  increase  the  efficiency  of the  resources  employed  and  thus  reduce  the  need  to extract virgin raw materials.\n\nTo help achieve these objectives, Saint-Gobain's businesses  and  organizations  in  the  countries  where  it operates rely on three levers:\n\n- \u00b7 promote circular flows;\n- \u00b7 strengthen circularity through operational performance and  innovation,  in  terms  of  manufacturing  processes, materials, products and solutions;\n- \u00b7 manage waste throughout the value chain, minimizing its generation and increasing its recovery.\n\nSaint-Gobain's  aim  is  to  promote  the  recirculation  of natural resources  and  manufactured  products  while minimizing waste at every stage of the construction value chain: upstream  with  suppliers, downstream  during customer operations through to the end user, and within the Group's own operations.\n\nResponsible  resource  management  and  the  preservation of water resources are the subject of Group-wide policies, and  each  Saint-Gobain  site,  whatever  its  business  or country  of  operation,  implements  the  principles  of  these policies (see section 2.3.3.B.b, p. 87).\n\nTechnical synergies and business expertise are fundamental  to  facilitating  the  reformulation  of  product compositions and accelerating the substitution of natural raw  materials  for  renewable  or  recycled  ones.  These changes potentially imply changes in industrial processes, so  the  industrial  and  R&D  departments  of  the  business lines are at the heart of this approach.\n\nLastly,  action  plans  are  implemented  on  a  country-bycountry basis according to the portfolio of products and solutions on  offer, the technical modalities  of  the construction  market,  the  maturity  of  stakeholders  on  the subject  of  the  circular  economy,  and  local  capacities  to create partnerships. Finally, waste management regulations and public policies to encourage the application of circular economy principles throughout the construction market value chain.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Efforts  are underway  to  increase  the  volumes  available  at  an acceptable  cost  and  quality  (see  section  3.4.3.B,  p.  129), but the creation of supply chains will be gradual, country by country.\n\nIt  is  therefore  essential  to  continue  efforts  to  reduce  the natural  resource  intensity  per  unit  produced,  in  order  to limit the impact of extraction on the environment and the risks of resource depletion.\n\nThe main natural raw materials consumed by Saint-Gobain are  sand,  gypsum  and  iron  ore.  Semi-processed  raw materials such as cement, which uses sand as its main raw material, and plastics derived from fossil resources are also among the main raw materials purchased by the Group.\n\nThe portfolio of products and solutions of Saint -Gobain is analyzed  transversally  by  the  business  line  under  the responsibility  of  the  marketing  and  development  teams with three priorities:\n\n- \u00b7 reducing  the  intensity  of  virgin  natural  resources consumed per unit of output;\n- \u00b7 the  capacity  of  substitution  of  non-renewable  raw materials and  hazardous  substances  by  recycled materials or co-products, including in the manufacture of packaging;\n- \u00b7 The  development  of  formulations  to  reduce  their content  of  hazardous  substances  until  their  complete replacement, thus avoiding the dissemination of materials generated during the recycling process;\n\nThe  solutions  proposed  by  Saint-Gobain  as  part  of  its \"Sustainable  and  High-Performance  Solutions\"  initiative (see  section  3.2.3.C,  p.  104)  are  offers  with  a  reduced environmental footprint or that reduce the environmental impact during the use phase. Solutions with a renewable or  recycled  materials  content  above  a  defined  threshold, or solutions developed by Weber that help reduce water consumption  on  construction  sites  are  examples  of solutions that help reduce pressure on natural resources.\n\nLastly, because construction already accounts for 37% of the  world's  resource  consumption (1) , Saint-Gobain  is actively and collaboratively involved in discussions on the evolution of building methods  towards  lightweight construction solutions (see section 2.1.1.B.c, p. 67) that use fewer raw materials for at least equivalent performance.\n\n\u00cb\n\n## A - Reducing natural resource intensity\n\nTo  reduce  the  natural  resource  intensity  of  its  offering, Saint-Gobain relies on operational excellence carried out in the WCM  program  (see  section 2.3.3.A, p. 84). Performance in terms  in terms of quality and productivity, is  the  first  step    to  reduce  industrial  waste  and  optimize the use of resources.\n\nMost of the Group's business lines are working to reduce the  resource  intensity  of  their  products,  by  reducing  the average  weight  for  the  same  unit  of  product,  without affecting  technical  performance.  This  is  the  case,  for example,  for  car  windshields  and  plasterboard.  Several countries have already implemented the BANTAM program, which aims to reduce the weight of plasterboard by working on industrial processes and product formulations.  Some  plants  have  been  able  to  reduce  the weight  of  their  standard  boards  by  more  than  20% compared  with  their  initial  weight.  The  SLIMWOOL program, deployed since 2018 worldwide, aims to optimize the weight of glass wool, while guaranteeing the product's thermal performance.\n\nLightweight  construction  (see  section  2.1.1.B.b,  p.  66) consists  of  building  a  skeleton  -  made  of  wood,  metal, concrete or a combination of these materials - onto which lightweight facade systems and non-load-bearing interior partitions are attached. This reduces the resource intensity of buildings. Traditional building techniques  require greater  consumption  of  cement,  concrete  or  bricks,  the production  of  which  requires  the  extraction  of  large quantities of non-renewable natural raw materials, particularly sand. Lightweight construction can reduce raw materials consumption by up to 50%.\n\n## B - Substituting natural resources with recycled or renewable materials\n\nSome Saint-Gobain  products,  such  as  glass  and  gypsum products,  can  be  recycled  indefinitely  in  a  closed-loop industrial process. Industrial processes are then adapted to the  replacement  of  natural  raw  materials  by  recycled materials  from  internal  or  external  collection,  whose characteristics,  in  terms  of  granulometry,  moisture  or impurity content, may differ from those of virgin materials.\n\nWhether substitution is developed on the basis of closedloop recyclable products, or by  changing  product formulations and adding renewable or recycled materials, or  co-products  from  other  businesses  or  markets,  the quest  for  maximum  substitution  of  non-recyclable  raw materials is an element of the WCM industrial performance improvement program (see section 2.3.3.A, p. 84). The aim of  this  substitution  is  to  maintain  or  even  improve  the quality  and  competitiveness  of  products  and  solutions, while  reducing  their  carbon  footprint.  For  example,  glass wool production can incorporate recycled glass from flat glass recycling (window glazing or windscreens), packaging  glass  recycling  and  glass  wool  recycling  from construction or deconstruction sites.",

        "page_content": "To avoid their  dissemination  or  perpetuation  in  recycling cycles,  it  is  essential  to  reduce  the  content  of  hazardous substances in compositions (see section 3.2.2..B.a, p. 99).\n\nThese  compositional  changes,  which  consist  in  reducing the contribution of extracted virgin materials and replacing  them  with  recycled  materials  from  end-of-life product recovery circuits, require adaptations to industrial sites,  particularly  in  terms  of  raw  material  storage  areas, composition workshops, and even the industrial processes themselves.  It  may  also  be  necessary  to  set  up  ad  hoc sorting  and  shredding  facilities  to  prepare  secondary materials.\n\nEach country develops innovations based on its access to new  sources  of  recycled  or  biosourced  materials,  or  coproducts.  Actions  concern  not  only  products,  but  also their  packaging.  Action  plans  have  been  deployed  to reduce  packaging  overall,  increase  the  proportion  of recycled  or  biosourced  materials  in  its  composition,  and ensure that it is recyclable. For example, marketing teams and  buyers  have  been  working  together  to  change packaging materials or their design to encourage recycling in existing circuits.\n\nThe  quantity  of  recycled  material  in  products  depends essentially on the existence, in countries or even territories, of efficient and sustainable collection networks capable of supplying the sites.\n\n## C - Preserving water resources\n\nThe world's water resources are finite, and depend on the geographical  area  under  consideration.  The  effects  of climate change are having a major impact on the renewal of water resources, and the number of areas with high and very high water stress is constantly increasing. Depending on  the  location,  access  to  water  will  have  to  be  divided between  use  by  populations,  agriculture  or  industry. According to the World Resources Institute (WRI), some 4 billion  people  are  already  exposed  to  water  stress  for  at least one month of the year. At the same time, demand for water is set to increase by 30% by 2050.\n\nMore performance with less\n\nSaint-Gobain's  Water  policy  (see  section  2.3.3.B.b,  p.  87) includes  specific  objectives  for  the  preservation  of  water resources. These concern the reuse or recycling, internally or  externally,  of  water  used  in  industrial  processes,  and take  into  account  the  challenges  of  conflicts  of  use  in regions of high and very high water stress.\n\nSaint-Gobain uses water as a thermal fluid, particularly for cooling,  as  a  washing  fluid,  as  a  raw  material  for  the production  of  mortar  and  gypsum,  and  to  provide  our employees  with  access  to  drinking  water  and  sanitary facilities.  This  last  use  represents  a  marginal  share  of  the Group's water withdrawals.\n\nThe  main  use  is  for  cooling  operations.  For  many applications, it is possible to create closed-loop systems. In this way, water withdrawals are limited and correspond to the  replacement  of  water  evaporated  during  operations. The proportion of water reused in processes reached 88% in 2023. Investing in a closed-loop system is the first step towards drastically reducing water consumption.\n\nWhen  water  is  used  as  a  raw  material  in  a  process, technical and R&D teams work on optimizing consumption and developing processes to reduce water requirements.\n\nSaint-Gobain is committed to reducing water consumption by  50%  in  absolute  terms  between  2017  and  2030. Specific  investments  have  been  earmarked  for  priority projects in \"focus sites\" (see section 2.3.3.B.b, p xx), which account for almost 80% of the Group's water withdrawals and for  sites  located  in  areas  of  high  or  very  high  water stress. 31 projects have been identified. They concern the detection  and  sealing  of  leaks  or  the  replacement  of installations such as washing stations or compressors.\n\nSaint-Gobain  also  offers  solutions  for  water  resource management.  Materials  retailers  such  as  PUM  in  France and  Br\u00f8drene  Dahl  in  the  Nordic  countries,  for  example, offer rainwater management and leak detection solutions. Saint-Gobain  PAM  is  a  leader  in  the  traditional  water management  market,  offering  innovative  solutions  for intelligent  network  monitoring.  The  High-Performance Solutions  Business  Units  develop  expanded  clay-based filtration solutions and microfiltration membranes respectively.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Group believes that waste should be considered  as  a  strategic  resource  and  that  secondary materials (from reuse, recycling) or co-products should be used whenever possible, as a substitute for non-renewable virgin resources.\n\nReducing the consumption of non-renewable primary raw materials  per  functional  unit  produced  and  the  waste generated  by  industrial  processes  are  the  pillars  of  the sustainable resources management policy initiated in 2015 (see  section  2.3.3.B.b,  p.  87)  with  the  aim  of  moving towards the 'zero unrecovered waste.'\n\nOverall  synergies  are  possible  across  the  businesses  for each industrial process or non-renewable raw material to identify  the  deposits,  material  qualities  or  even  best technical  practices  and  favorable  technical  innovations that  are  conductive  to  optimizing  the  use  of  resources. Cross-business  working  groups  including  the  Industrial and Technical Departments, purchases, sustainable development experts on the collection and processing of recycled  materials  have  been  set  up  to  develop  these synergies.\n\n## A - Reducing and recovering waste\n\n## In Group operations\n\nTo achieve it's objectives of reducing and recovering the quantities  of  waste  generated  by  its  industrial  and  trade activities,  Saint-Gobain  relies  on  the  three  Rs  hierarchy: Reduce, Reuse and Recycle.\n\nThe  sites  strive  to  reduce  the  waste  generated  during production  operations  and  seek  to  reuse  production residues in their own industrial processes. To this end, sites are  investing  in  waste  reprocessing  units  and  adapting their  industrial  processes.  For  example,  investments  have been made at several sites  in  the  United  States,  such  as Nashville,  Arkansas,  where  the  manufacturing  site  is  now able  to  recycle  in  a  closed  loop  its  production  waste, equivalent to over 50,000 tonnes per year, thus saving as much  virgin  material  and  avoiding  the  environmental impacts  associated  with  landfill  disposal  as  well  as  the extraction of virgin raw materials.\n\nEven for industrial processes favorable to the incorporation  of  recycled  materials,  optimizations  are possible. Saint -Gobain's plasterboard manufacturing plant in Vietnam has introduced a process to separate the paper from the plasterboard during a waste reprocessing phase. The  plaster  is  reincorporated  into  the  process  when  the paper is recycled in the manufacture of cardboard via an external  recovery  network.  Production  waste  generated during  the  production  of  bitumen  membranes  in  the United States is recovered externally for use in addition for bitumen for road construction or renovation.\n\n\u00cb\n\nSome  of  the  waste  generated  during  the  production  of mineral  wools  is  reprocessed  before  being  recovered externally as a secondary raw material for the cement and clay industries (tiles and bricks) or for certain manufacturers  that  manufacture  acoustic  ceilings.  The Group  is  also  involved  in  the  creation  of  recycling networks with the help of external local partners. Progress in  the  reduction  and  recycling  of  waste  made  at  certain Group sites shows that 'zero non-recovered waste' is an achievable ambition.\n\nFinally, the management of finished product inventories is also optimized. For example, Saint-Gobain in France works with  an  association  of  Group  retirees,  Saint-Gobain Solidarit\u00e9s,  to  act  as  a  link  between  the  Group's  sites  in France  and  local  associations  in  order  to  facilitate donations  of  materials,  particularly  unsold  stock.  In  this way, the destruction of certain stocks is avoided and their use is facilitated.\n\n## Downstream customer operations\n\nSaint-Gobain strives to optimize the volume of packaging for its products and to ensure that it is recyclable. To this end, the Group has set itself the target of having 100% of its packaging recyclable by 2030. In 2023, the proportion of recyclable packaging reached 94.6%.\n\nIn the countries where they are present, building materials trading  brands  are  organizing  themselves  to  take  back construction  site  waste  from  the  same  types  of  building materials,  products  and  equipment  they  sell.  In  France, construction  site  waste  collection  points  for  craftsmen have  been  set  up  close  to  sales  outlets.  Various partnerships have been set up with specialized companies and  start-ups  such  as  Tri'n'collect  to  speed  up  the recovery, sorting and recycling of construction site waste.\n\nGypsum plasterboard recovered from construction sites is reprocessed. Once the contaminants have been eliminated,  processing  involves  grinding  and  separating the  paper  present  on  both  sides  of  the  board.  While plaster  itself  can  be  recycled  in  a  closed  loop  and  under certain  conditions  without  any  loss  of  material,  the presence  of  paper  on  both  sides  of  the  board  has  a negative impact on the manufacturing process and must therefore  be  eliminated  as  far  as  possible.  Today,  some Saint-Gobain plants achieve an average recycled content of  30%,  most  of  which  comes  from  construction  or demolition plaster waste. In France, Placopl\u00e2tre has even launched  Placo  Infini,  a  plasterboard  with  50%  recycled content, in 2023.\n\nFor flat glass, the recycling of window glass, facade glass or  automotive  glass  is  infinitely  possible  as  long  as  the collected glass elements meet the quality requirements of a  'float'  furnace,  in  particular  that  contaminants  of  all kinds  are  eliminated.  The  integration  into  products  is therefore  mainly  dependent  on  the  existence  of  efficient and  sustainable  collection  networks,  which  are  able  to ensure sorting that meets the desired quality specifications.\n\nIn February 2023, Saint-Gobain North America, through its building products subsidiary Certain Teed  Roofing, acquired from its recycling partner Asphaltica the rights to a technology that will enable it to recycle asphalt shingle waste,  This  technology  will  enable  Saint-Gobain  to transform post-industrial and  post-consumer  shingle waste into granules.",

        "page_content": "Glass wool from renovation, building demolition or waste generated  during  construction  operations  can  also  be recycled for new glass wool production. A new technology has  been  developed  by  Saint-Gobain  and  has  been operational since 2023 at the Chemill\u00e9 site in France. This technology will gradually be rolled out across Europe.\n\nThis technology makes it possible to complete the range of construction products that can be recycled in a closed loop with a minimum loss of resources, thus ensuring the potential recovery of construction site waste for construction  companies  and  customers.  Whatever  the construction  products  considered,  for  recovery  to  be effective it is essential that craftsmen sort their waste on site  during  construction,  deconstruction  or  renovation operations.\n\n## B - Create recycling channels\n\nWhile techniques for recycling and recovering construction  waste  do  exist,  the  implementation  of integrated  waste  collection,  treatment  and  recycling systems  is  highly  dependent  on  the  region,  country  or even  territory.  It  requires  with  the  support  of  external partners, we are setting up channels to collect, transport, sort and reprocess waste, before turning it into secondary raw materials suitable for reintroduction into our processes. Other Group  products  also  accept  the replacement of virgin raw materials by recycled materials from other consumption channels, recycling channels from industries  other  than  construction.  This  is  the  case,  for example, in the production of glass wool, cast-iron pipes and ceramic grains and powders.\n\nSaint-Gobain has developed  a  network  in  Europe, Saint -Gobain Glass Recycling, to facilitate the recycling of flat glass from dismantling or processing waste. The aim is to  qualify  local  companies  capable  of  collecting  and dismantling  glass  products,  and  who  are  committed  to promoting  the  closed-loop  float  recycling  of  end-of-life glass.  Some  twenty  partners  have  already  joined  the network,  offering  processing  and  recycling  services  for glass products.\n\nSince  2019,  the  Group  has  launched  its  I-LOOP  project, supported  by  the  European  Union  via  its  LIFE  funding program.  This  project  aims  to  contribute  to  the  gradual recovery of glass wool waste generated on construction, renovation or demolition sites, waste currently most often landfilled.  The  project  aims  to  offer  construction  market players  new  value  chains  for  glass  wool  recycling  in France,  Germany  and  parts  of  Scandinavia,  as  a  costeffective alternative to landfill.\n\nEcophon, producer of acoustic panels and ceiling systems, has  also  developed  a  recycling  and  reuse  service  called \"SoundCircularity\" to collect and  recycle  end-of-life ceilings.  This  service  is  available  in  Sweden,  Finland  and France.  The  ambition  is  to  extend  its  availability  across Europe.\n\nMore performance with less\n\nThe  industrial  sectors  are  also  developing  new  services linked  to  the  circular  economy.  The  Ceramics  Business Unit  has  created  the  Valoref  activity,  specialized  in  the treatment  and  recovery  of  refractory  brick  waste.  The recovery of waste is carried out mainly during the repair or reconstruction of glass furnaces. A global waste management  service  is  offered  to  clients  upstream  of furnace repair or reconstruction sites. Valoref ensures the collection, treatment and recovery of waste from the sites. The  waste  collected  are  primarily  recycled  in  the refractory  production  chain.  The  other  recovery  circuits are  the  manufacture  of  construction  materials  such  as mortars or tiles, and other industrial additives.\n\n## C - Facilitating reuse or recycling\n\nFrom the design of products, solutions or services to the benefits  expected  by  clients  and  end  users  and  the management of product end-of-life, Saint-Gobain's offering  must  enable  the  integration  of  more  recycled, renewable  materials  or  co-products  to  reduce  the consumption  of  virgin  raw  materials, facilitate the recycling or reuse of products at the end of their life cycle to  successfully  meet  market  needs  with  a  limited  impact on natural resources, and extend the life of products. The same  approach  applied  to  products  also  applies  to  the packaging that accompanies them.\n\nAction plans are deployed at central level and relayed to national level to improve the recyclability and increase the recycled or bio-sourced content of packaging used.\n\nThe criterion of optimizing natural resources is one of the benefits identified as part of the program to develop the range of sustainable, high-performance solutions (see  section  3.2.3.C,  p.  104).  This  criterion  includes  both limiting  the  use  of  exhaustible  natural  resources  and integrating recycled  or  renewable  materials  or  coproducts into product compositions.\n\nWhile it  is  difficult  to  extend  the  lifespan  of  construction products,  it  is  possible  to  optimize  the  use  of  buildings. Thinking about building design and construction methods anticipates  the  possibility  of  modularizing  buildings  to make them more flexible and adapt their use during their life cycle. For example, Saint-Gobain's offerings include the ability  to  dismantle  and  reuse  certain  products,  such  as lightweight plasterboard partitions. For example, Saint -Gobain's  offerings  include  the  ability  to  dismantle and reuse certain products such as lightweight plasterboard  partitions.  For  example,  the  60,000  m \u00b2 of interior  partitions  in  the  Athletes'  Village  buildings  have been specially designed to be dismantled, and the majority of materials will be reused, in order to meet the Paris 2024 Games' objectives of being responsible and exemplary in terms  of  natural  resource  consumption.  They  will  enable the athletes' rooms to be easily converted into accommodation and student rooms after the competitions.\n\n<!-- image -->",

These  developments depend on a wide range of factors, such as consumption patterns,  infrastructure  and  industrial  fabric,  regulatory environment,  and  technical  and  logistical  conditions  for waste management.\n\nEven  if  the  circular  economy  develops  along  the  value chain  of  construction  markets,  the  pool  of  materials  that can  be  collected  and  recycled  may  be  limited.  The resources used in buildings are stored over the long term. Construction  techniques  have  only  recently  taken  into account  deconstruction  methods.  As  a  result,  it  is  often difficult to separate  materials  and  isolate  potential contaminants.  Site  waste  collection  is  concentrated  on waste  from  construction  and  renovation  sites.  The efficiency  of  waste  collection  channels  relies  on  selective sorting  of  materials  as  close  as  possible  to  the  worksite. Training  craftsmen  and  customers'  employees  in  the challenges  of  sorting  and  efficient  selective  collection systems  are  decisive  factors  in  developing  sources  of materials for recycling.\n\nThis  is  why  action  plans  for  a  transition  to  a  circular economy  are  highly  dependent  on  the  country  and  the maturity  of  local  stakeholders,  regulations  and  logistics. Approaches  are  therefore  deployed  by  country  to mobilize channels for the recovery of construction waste. Saint-Gobain  organizations  in  the  countries  initiate  or participate in actions with local stakeholders: manufacturers participating in a channel, customers, local authorities or communities.\n\n\u00cb\n\nSaint-Gobain's  organization  by  country  is  conducive  to accelerating  the  transition.  It  makes  it  possible  to  seize opportunities and create local synergies, between brands or with partners outside the Group. Brands and businesses can  pool  their  efforts  in  waste  collection,  particularly construction site waste. For example, the Leca and Isover brands have joined forces in Denmark. Together, they have signed  an  agreement  with  a  company  specializing  in recycling,  which  will  process  unused  or  used  glass  wool. Danish  craftsmen  will  thus  be  able  to  deposit  used  or unused  glass  wool  in  dedicated  processing  stations.  The success of this approach depends largely on the quality of sorting at source. To this end, Danish teams have designed practical guides to support the roll-out of the approach.\n\nIn some countries, particularly in Europe, public authorities are  introducing  ambitious  regulations  to  speed  up  the transition  to  a  circular  economy.  When  this  is  the  case, Saint-Gobain usually joins forces with trade associations or collective  business  initiatives.  In  France,  for  example, Saint -Gobain was very active in the creation of the Valobat eco-organization, which aims to create recycling channels for construction waste.\n\nIn  North  America,  initiatives  have  been  taken  to  seize recycling  opportunities,  depending  on  the  business  and geographical location. In California, for example, windshield waste from the Mobility Business Unit's site is reprocessed and recycled in a glass wool production plant. Initiatives  are  also  underway  to  recover  plasterboard waste  around  the  Certain  Teed  plant  in  Buchanan,  New York, and in Canada, around the Vancouver plant.",

Among the criteria used to evaluate the benefits in terms of health, comfort, safety and well-being are:\n\n- \u00b7 the reduction of occupational risks in the value chain;\n- \u00b7 ergonomics for applicators\n- \u00b7 indoor  air  quality  and  comfort  acoustic,  thermal  and visual for end-users, building occupants.\n\nSo  the  efforts  to  make  products  lighter  as  part  of programs to reduce carbon footprints or reduce pressure on resources have beneficial effects on product ergonomics. As a result, the weights handled by craftsmen on site are limited.\n\nIn Europe, the emphasis is on a specific prescription offer for private tertiary, educational and healthcare establishments and  multi-family housing. In Poland, Saint -Gobain  Solutions  brings  together  all  local  brands,\n\n## 3.5.2 ETHICS AND RESPONSABILITY\n\n## A - Respect for human rights\n\n## a.  Commitments\n\nSaint -Gobain's  values,  formalized  by  the  Principles  of Conduct and Action, are an essential vector of mobilization for  human  rights  due  to  their  reference  to  international conventions,  such  as  the  International  Charter  on  Human Rights  or  the  applicable  conventions  of  the  International Labor  Organization  and  in  particular  the  conventions  87, 98, 111 and 135 on the freedom of association and protection of  the  right  to  organize,  on  the  right  to  organize  and collective  bargaining,  on  discrimination,  and  on  workers' representatives respectively.\n\nSaint -Gobain has been a signatory of the United Nations Global Compact since 2003. The first two principles of the Global Compact invite companies to 'support and respect the protection of internationally proclaimed  human rights'  (principle  No.  1)  and  'make  sure  that  their  own companies are not complicit in human rights abuses' (principle No. 2).\n\nIn  2019,  the  Group  published  its  policy  on  respect  for human rights. The policy has been presented to the Board of  Directors.  It  describes  how  Saint -Gobain  takes  into account human rights impacts and outlines the associated due  diligence  process.  The  whole  approach  is  based  on the  recommendations  of  the  United  Nations,  particularly the  guiding  principles  on  business  and  human  rights. Accordingly,  Saint -Gobain  is  committed  to  respecting human  rights  wherever  the  Group  conducts  its  activities and in its supply chain.\n\npromoting the development of systems and cross-selling in  key  segments  such  as  premium  multi-family  housing, sports complexes, and educational and healthcare buildings.  In  France,  Saint-Gobain  has  published  a  white paper bringing together the Group's expertise to meet the changing needs of healthcare establishments, such as the evolution of patient care,\n\nEcophon has published a research report on the impact of noise in education. Noise levels in educational establishments  can  have  negative  effects  not  only  on learning,  but  also  on  the  physical  and  mental  health  of teachers. Dedicated solutions are being developed.\n\nChanging lifestyles and an ageing population also call for the  adaptation  of  living  spaces,  particularly  homes.  For example,  our  materials  trade  teams  in  France  have developed  a  specific  offer  for  senior  citizens  and  the adaptation  of  homes  to  anticipate  loss  of  independence and the associated risk of falls.\n\nThe principles for applying the human rights policy to the supply  chain  and  the  implementation  of  the  associated due diligence are described in section 3.2.1.A, p. 95.\n\n## b.  Analysis of human rights risks in the Group's activities\n\nSaint -Gobain's  main  human  rights  issues  are  identified following  the  methodology  proposed  by  the  United Nations  in  the  context  of  the  application  of  its  guiding principles and concern the human rights that are likely to be most seriously affected by the negative impact of the company's activities and its value chain.\n\nThe  method  to  identify  the  risks  of  actual  or  potential negative impacts draws on the United Nations' reference base  and  on  external  sources  recognized  for  their relevance.  These  sources  are  linked  to  international institutions  such  as  the  United  Nations  with  the  Human Development Index, specialist non-governmental organizations  such  as  the  Transparency  International Corruption Perceptions Index, or foundations such as The Global Slavery Index by the Walk Free Foundation to end forced labor.\n\nThe analysis resulted in a mapping of the risks related to the  Group's  activities.  It  includes  the  risks  related  to  the supply chain and respect for human rights described in the section  on  responsible  purchasing  (see  section  3.2.1.A.a, p. 96).\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\nA better living for all\n\nThe risk mapping covers the nature of the risks linked to activities  and  risks  linked  to  the  countries  in  which Saint -Gobain  operates.  The  main  risks  identified  concern four areas: respect for employee rights, health and safety at work, respect for the environment and anti-corruption.\n\nThe management of occupational health and safety risks is described  in  section  3.2.2.B,  p.  99,  and  those  concerning respect  for  the  environment  in  section  3.2.2.C,  p.  101. Corruption  risk  management  is  described  in  section 2.3.1.C.a, p. 79.\n\nIn November  2023,  the  due  diligence  process  was undertaken  to  update  the  Group's  assessment  of  human rights risks and  impacts  as  well  as  the  measures implemented  to  manage  these  risks,  limit  the  risks  of negative impacts, provide responses to impacted stakeholders  if  necessary,  and  improve  situations  that need  to  be  improved.  To  this  end,  a  questionnaire  was sent  to  human  resources  and  operational  managers  in  31 countries  identified  as  the  most  exposed,  and  the responses  were  analyzed.  This  analysis allows the verification  that  the  Group's  practices  are  in  line  with human rights policy and that the risks are identified.\n\n## c.  Measures to control risks associated with employee rights\n\nRespect  for  people  and  respect  for  the  rights  of employees are essential to ensure a just and fair working environment  for  personal  and  professional  development (see section 2.3.2, p. 80). Respect for people' and 'respect for the rights of employees' are two principles that make up  the  Saint -Gobain  Code  of  Ethics,  the  first  being  a principle of behavior and the second a principle of action. In addition, thanks to its human rights policy, Saint -Gobain clearly described  its commitment  to  the  following principles: the fight against forced labor, the fight against child  labor,  freedom  of  association  and  the  fight  against discrimination.  Since  signing  the  United  Nations  Global Compact,  the  Group  has  published  a  communication  on progress  in  these  areas.  In  addition,  in  2022,  the  Group supplemented its system with the publication of an antiharassment policy.\n\nSaint -Gobain entities ensure that each employee performs their  work  on  the  basis  of  freely  agreed  terms  of employment  according  to  a  shared  and  accepted document and receives payment of a fair wage according to the hours worked. Freedom  of  association is guaranteed at all industrial sites and sales outlets. The age of the employee is checked by local employees as part of the fight against child labor. An annual analysis of the HR database is performed to verify that employees under the age of 18 are employed under specific contracts related to their education, such as apprenticeship contracts.\n\nFinally,  the  Group  values  and  seeks  diversity  among  its teams. Mutual respect and a policy of equal treatment in terms  of  recruitment,  access  to  promotions,  professional training and compensation are the main levers for action. Everywhere  it  operates,  Saint -Gobain  undertakes  to promote  inclusion  and  diversity  in  all  its  forms:  gender, nationalities,  training,  career  paths,  generational  diversity, disabilities and ethnic and social origins.\n\n\u00cb\n\nIncidents of discrimination, whether or not a complaint has been lodged and whether or not they are in the process of adjudication  or  have  been  definitively  adjudicated  and characterized  as  such,  are  reported  by  the  network  of local human  resources  managers.  Every  incident  is examined  and  dealt  with  in  the  subsidiaries  concerned. Group  employees  also  have  access  to  a  whistle-blowing system allowing them to remain anonymous, described in, section  3.5.2.C,  p.  133.  Particular  attention  is  paid  to ensuring  confidentiality  and  protecting  people  from  all reprisals in accordance with the whistle-blowing policy.\n\nFollowing the analysis of the questionnaires completed by Saint -Gobain's  local  teams  at  the  end  of  2023  as  part  of the  due  diligence  process,  preventive  actions  have  been launched  to  further  limit  the  risks  of  human  rights incidents.  Best  practices  identified  in  certain  countries concerning recruitment agencies, worker accommodation and  security  forces  have  been  shared.  They  will  be supplemented  by  awareness-raising  on  certain  forms  of forced labor.\n\n## B - Participation in public debate\n\n## a.  Advocacy\n\nSaint -Gobain participates in public debates on the strategic challenges  for  its  business  activity  and  environment.  This participation takes place directly, via professional associations, and via global, regional, or local alliances. The Group's advocacy activities aim to constructively feed into discussions  and  bring  together  value  chain  players  and stakeholders.  Inspired  by  its  corporate  purpose  'Making the world a better home,' Saint -Gobain regularly works on the priority themes of decarbonization of the economy and circularity  in  the  construction  sector  (see  sections  3.3,  p. 106, and 3.4, p. 124).\n\nSaint -Gobain and the majority of its subsidiaries belong to professional associations representing their industry at the national or supranational level. For example, in France, the Group is involved in professional associations representing companies,  such  as  Afep  or  Medef.  Saint -Gobain's subsidiaries also cooperate with various local associations or organizations involved in regulatory issues, or related to environmental,  social,  societal  or  economic  issues.  The subsidiaries  have  internal  procedures  in  place  to  ensure that  their  participation  in  associations  is  recognized  and referenced,  and  that  employees  who  represent  them  in associations are trained in the rules of antitrust law.\n\nSaint -Gobain  ensures  that  its  advocacy  initiatives  are aligned  with  its  commitment  to  contribute  to  carbon neutrality by 2050. Its actions and positions therefore take into account the ambition to limit the rise in temperatures to below 1.5 \u00b0C.\n\nThe  Group  ensures  proper  coordination  of  the  positions taken locally and ensures that these institutional commitments  are  well  known  and  respected  by  the countries.  Saint -Gobain  complies  with  the  transparency obligations applicable to relations between companies and public authorities in all countries where it operates.",

Multi-stakeholder partnerships\n\nAs  a  member  of  the  United  Nations  Global  Compact, Saint -Gobain regularly reports on its progress in the areas covered by the Compact, to which it adheres at the 'GC Advanced' level, i.e., according to 21 criteria. Saint -Gobain also  encourages  its  partners,  particularly  its  suppliers,  to commit to the Global Compact's ten principles.\n\nLikewise,  the  Group  pays  special  attention  to  the  United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), so as to make  progress  in  evaluating  the  real  impacts  that companies  can  have  in  working  towards  a  fairer,  more sustainable  world.  These  goals  also  make  possible  new multi-stakeholder  collaborations,  in  which  companies  are engaged locally and globally.\n\nFinally, the Group is a member of the forum of committed companies with the organization Transparency International  France.  Thus,  Saint -Gobain  supports  the association's activities and has committed to rejecting and combating  corruption,  in  all  its  forms.  The  Group undertakes to make its best efforts to implement a solid prevention  mechanism,  inspired  by  the  current  best practices of the business world.\n\nA better living for all\n\n## C - The whistle-blowing system SpeakUp! by Saint -Gobain\n\nSaint -Gobain  has  an  ethical  and  professional  whistleblowing  system  that  is  accessible  to  employees  and  all other  stakeholders  (clients,  suppliers,  shareholders,  trade unions,  NGOs,  local  communities,  etc.)  to  report  any breaches  of  applicable  regulations  or  internal  rules  and procedures,  in  particular  those  related  to  the  code  of ethics.\n\nA secure platform is used to collect reports and interact with whistle-blowers, including anonymously, and manage investigation  follow-up  until  the  recommendations  are implemented. It is accompanied by a practical guide that reminds  the  'Alert  Examiners'  of  the  main  principles  of alert processing, describes the necessary steps (admissibility,  investigation,  and  conclusions)  and  the precautions  to  take  to  conduct  investigations  in  a confidential, professional and impartial manner. Finally, this guide provides documentary support to inform and secure exchanges  with  the  parties,  whether  they  are  alleged victims, witnesses or respondents.\n\nThe  policy  on  the  Group  whistle-blowing  system  and  an explanatory  video  facilitating  the  understanding  and  the use of the platform by stakeholders are published on the Saint -Gobain website.\n\nIn 2023,  more  than  1,100  alerts  were  received  and processed throughout the Group.\n\nThis  year,  reporting  of  the  platform's  alerts  once  again revealed  the  high  expectations  of  employees  regarding the Group's values and the behavior of managers. Beyond the personal situations, each report to the organization is also an opportunity to progress and deploy an action plan.\n\nAnnual data on the collection of alerts are published in Saint -Gobain's non-financial results (see section 4.2.2.C, p. 165).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "A better living for all\n\n## 3.5.3 AN ENGAGING WORK ENVIRONMENT\n\n## A - Wage policy and employee benefits\n\nWage policies are set by the countries in line with market conditions. In most of the countries in which Saint -Gobain operates,  minimum  wages  are  set  either  within  the  legal framework or by negotiating collective bargaining agreements.  In  2021,  under  3%  of  employees  were  not covered by one of these provisions. The Group favors the collective bargaining strategy which is a way  of guaranteeing  a  minimum  standard  of  living  for  all employees depending on the local situation.\n\nA general framework called the Framework for wages sets out common  rules  and  principles to ensure fair compensation  for  Saint -Gobain  employees.  It  has  been circulated within the HR network and is published on the Group's website.\n\nIn  2022,  Saint -Gobain  conducted  a  country  survey  to better identify the actions taken to ensure a decent wage, but  also  complementary  elements  to  compensation  such as  individual  and  collective  bonuses  or  social  benefits. Under  3%  of  employees  are  paid  only  the  legal  or negotiated  minimum  wage.  Almost  68%  of  full-time employees have an individual or group bonus program.\n\nThe  survey  also  confirmed  that  over  99%  of  our employees  benefit  from  locally-defined  programs  that guarantee them a pension at the end of their career.\n\nIn an uncertain economic climate in some countries, salary negotiations  have  taken  into  account  the  impact  of inflation  on  the  lowest  salaries,  so  that  employees  can maintain a minimum standard of living.\n\nAt the same time, employee shareholding offers employees  the  option  to  become  shareholders  under preferential conditions, either directly as individuals or via involvement  in  a  dedicated  collective  fund.  The  Group Savings Plan (PEG) enables them to acquire Saint -Gobain shares at a discount and, in some countries, an additional amount.  In  France,  to  encourage  a  team  spirit  and  to associate  each  person  with  the  success  of  the  Group, Saint -Gobain favors the conclusion of collective incentive agreements.  In  2023,  employee  shareholding  programs were offered in 53 countries, covering 97,8 % Saint-Gobain employees and, in certain countries, retirees. In addition to these  programs,  Saint -Gobain  has  set  up  long-term compensation  plans  including,  depending  on  the  year, stock options, performance shares and performance units (see section 5.2.4, p. 240).\n\n\u00cb\n\nSaint -Gobain  also  seeks  to  offer  its  employees  social guarantees  enabling  them  to  protect  themselves  against the  uncertainties  of  life.  Launched  on  January  1,  2020, CARE by Saint -Gobain is a social protection program for all  Group  employees  and  their  families.  The  coverage  is defined to meet basic daily healthcare needs but also to support key moments of family life:\n\n- \u00b7 Daily medical monitoring of families and access to care, by  covering  health  costs  (doctor  visits  or  basic hospitalization) at a rate of at least 80%;\n- \u00b7 The birth of a child, including adoption procedures, by paying at least 14 weeks of maternity leave with full pay and three days for the partner leave with full pay;\n- \u00b7 Fatality,  by  providing  the  family  with  financial  capital representing at least one year of the employee's salary.\n\nThe  program  has  been  rolled  out  country  by  country. Parenthood  measures  were  rolled  out  in  2020,  and  all Saint -Gobain employees currently enjoy minimum guaranteed parental leave at their full salaries.\n\nBy  2023,  100%  of  Saint-Gobain  employees  and  their families  will  enjoy  the  full  benefits  of  the  CARE  by Saint -Gobain program. Newly-acquired entities have three years to finalize the roll-out of the program.\n\n## B - Social dialog\n\nSaint -Gobain  has  made  the  quality  of  social  dialogue  an essential criterion for the performance of its HR policy. The principle  of  consultation  and  negotiation,  either  directly with  employees  or  through  their  representatives,  is universal,  with  the  aim  of  translating  this  dialog  into collective  agreements.  Freedom  of  association  is  one  of the  values  embedded  in  the  Group's  code  of  ethics  and respect for it is a prerequisite for quality social dialog.\n\nBecause  social  dialog  must  provide  concrete  answers  to the questions of working conditions, the specific expectations  of  employees,  and  the  deployment  of  HR action  plans,  it  is  mainly  carried  out  at  local  level  in accordance  with  Saint -Gobain's  HR  policy  (see  section 2.3.2.A,  p.  80).  Executives  in  each  country  meet  with employee representatives periodically to discuss strategy and  local  issues.  As  such,  more  than  3131  agreements signed with employee representative bodies are active, of which  24,5%  include  criteria  related  to  employee  health and safety.",

        "page_content": "The various discussions held locally have made it possible -  in  some  subsidiaries  -  to  develop  work  flexibility,  in particular  to  meet  employees'  demands  for  a  better balance  between  their  personal  and  professional  life  and their family needs.\n\nEven  though  Saint -Gobain  encourages  social  dialog  at  a local  level,  Group  coordination  exists.  So  the  Chief Executive  Officer  of  Saint -Gobain  meets  with  the  central union  coordinators  several  times  a  year  and  chairs  the Works Council at least twice a year. At the European level, he  chairs  the  Convention  for  social  dialog,  which  brings together  70  union  representatives  from  28  European countries annually. With the aid of an independent expert, this  Convention  makes  it  possible  to  supplement  the national  dialog  by  dealing  with  subjects  of  common interest such as safety, Corporate Social Responsibility or the  trend  of  employment  on  European  sites.  These subjects  are  raised  in  particular  by  the  members  of  the Select  Committee,  which  acts  as  spokesman  for  the Convention, who benefit from specific training to perform their role and met by the Director of Social Affairs at least four times a year.\n\nListening to employees is essential to the success of social dialog.  The  employee  satisfaction  survey  conducted  in 2023  (see  section  2.3.4.B,  p.  90)  shows  that  85%  of respondents consider their working conditions to be good and  83%  that  the  balance  between  personal  and professional life was satisfactory.\n\nIn an uncertain economic context, the Group is committed, as far as possible, to implementing solutions to safeguard employment and only to making job cuts as a last resort. The aim is initially to reorganize to deal with situations on a temporary basis, as in the case of temporary lay-off, or to  favor  internal  mobility  agreements  which,  associated with incentive measures, make it possible to maintain jobs within  Saint -Gobain.  When  restructuring  is  inevitable,  the employees  affected  by  workforce  adjustments  benefit from personalized support programs which may result in training associated with retraining, assistance for geographic  mobility  or  support  for  the  execution  of  a personal project, such as the creation of a business.\n\nWhen companies are acquired,  coordination  is  set  up  to align  the  HR  policy  of  the  new  entities  with  the  Group's principles.\n\n## C - Diversity and inclusion\n\nDiversifying its teams ensures that Saint -Gobain is in tune with the world around it and understand its challenges, to be  enriched  by  different  skills  and  experience,  while developing its capacity to innovate. To meet its diversity and  inclusion  targets,  the  Group  is  working  to  create  an environment conducive to fairness and equality, crucial to employees'  professional  growth,  while  fostering  training and the cohesion of high-performance operational teams. The main drivers of this strategy are managers leading by example and the policy of equal treatment in the fields of recruitment, vocational training and compensation. Everywhere  it  operates,  Saint -Gobain  undertakes  to promote  inclusion  and  diversity  in  all  its  forms:  gender, nationalities,  training,  career  paths,  generational  diversity, disabilities and ethnic and social origins.\n\nA better living for all\n\nIn  addition,  employees  are  asked  a  specific  question  on diversity and inclusion as part of the annual me@Saint -Gobain  survey.  In  2023,  more  than  90%  of employees  indicated  that  people  were  respected  in  the company  regardless  of  their  profile  (gender,  age,  origin, sexual orientation, etc.).\n\nThe  Group  is  strongly  committed  to  the  themes  of diversity  and  inclusion,  which  are  one  of  its  priority  CSR challenges. The requirements to be followed are defined at the  global  level,  while  action  plans  to  support  this  vision are  rolled  out  locally.  An  overall  diversity  indicator incorporating diversity of gender, nationality and professional  experience  is  monitored  annually.  It  is  a performance  component  of  Saint -Gobain's  long-term compensation  plans  for  managers  (see  section  5.2.4,  p. 240).  The  Group  is  committed  to  maintaining  a  diversity index always above 90%, which is the case in 2023 with a diversity index of 91%.\n\nThe increase in the gender diversity of teams is based on a voluntarist  recruitment  policy  and  on  action  plans  for occupational promotion, equal pay, training and work/life balance. Objectives related to gender diversity have been set: 30% female managers in 2025 (target of 25% reached in 2020) and 25% female senior executives in 2025. They are monitored each quarter by the Executive Committee. They have been developed by country and Business Units and  are  integrated  into  the  performance  criteria  that determine  the  annual  variable  compensation  of  senior executives.  At  Group  level,  each  monthly  meeting  of  the Human Resources Committee has a section dedicated to women with the aim of boosting career opportunities.\n\nThese objectives  were  strengthened  in  2020  to  promote the  access  of  women  to  the  management  bodies  of Saint -Gobain:\n\n- \u00b7 30%  of  women  in  the  Group  Executive  Committee  in 2025;\n- \u00b7 an  average  of  30%  of  women  in  the  Executive Committees of Business Units in 2025.\n\nIn terms of training, an e-learning document on awareness of gender  diversity  issues,  entitled  Gender  Balance Awareness, has been drawn up in several languages and circulated  to  the  human  resources  and  management teams.  This  program  was  updated  at  the  end  of  2020 under a new e-learning format called Unconscious Bias.\n\nIn 2020, Saint -Gobain launched a program to use Big Data to  identify  differences  in  the  situation  between  women and  men  in  the  Group's  organizational  structure.  In addition  to  the  quantitative  indicators  available  in  nonfinancial  reporting,  the  aim  is  to  identify  underlying stereotypes  that  hinder  the  integration  of  women  into management  bodies  or  create  systematic  gaps  in  the situation.  In  accordance with the human resources policy (see section 2.3.2.A, p. 80), each country has implemented an action plan.\n\nFinally, since 2020, the parenting component of the social protection program mentioned earlier, CARE by Saint -Gobain (see section 3.5.3.C, p. 135), was rolled out in all  countries where the Group operates, with a guarantee of at least 14 weeks of maternity leave at full pay.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Executive Committee consists  of  31,3%  female  members  (5  women out of 16 in 2023, compared with 4 out of 16 in 2020 and 4 out of 17 in 2019).\n\nSaint -Gobain is a signatory to the Women's Empowerment Principles (WEP) since 2021, confirming its commitment to gender  equality.  Defined  by  the  United  Nations  Global Compact, the WEP are a set of principles that aim to help companies  to  promote  gender  equality  and  women's empowerment in the workplace.\n\nLikewise, insertion and retention of people with disabilities are  important  subjects  for  Saint -Gobain.  First  of  all, disability awareness and training initiatives are in place in the various countries. Several subsidiaries offer workshops in  partnership  with  specialized  bodies.  The  Group  also implements  recruitment  policies  in  partnership  with various specialist agencies, applying a strict nondiscrimination  policy.  For  example,  in  France,  several entities are in contact with ESATs (bodies promoting the inclusion  of  people  with  disabilities  in  society  and  the workplace)  to  support  them  in  their  efforts.  One  of Saint -Gobain's  objectives  is  to  make  everyday  life  easier for  employees  with  disabilities  by  adapting  workstations and hours.\n\nIn terms of diversity and inclusion, Saint -Gobain's approach  remains  similar  to  that  used  to  deploy  the Group's HR policy: common  values, policies and objectives,  deployed  by  each  country  according  to cultures and situations.\n\nTo develop a culture of inclusion, Saint-Gobain University has  made  available  an  e-learning  program  for  managers: inclusive management. Saint-Gobain has also participated, along with major French companies, in the production of a glossary in French and English which provides definitions and explanations of the main terms and concepts relating to diversity and inclusion.\n\nEach region or country establishes a diagnosis which then enables it to set priorities and local plans. Potential types of discrimination are identified, and appropriate programs are put into place. Gender, disability, and ethnic and social origins are taken into consideration in the diagnosis.\n\nTo encourage pluridisciplinarity and diversity of nationalities,  the  emphasis  is  on  the  valuing  of  diverse career paths in the areas of expertise (marketing, research and  development,  etc.)  and  on  equal  opportunities  for local profiles. In terms of generational diversity, Saint -Gobain  ensures  that  the  age  pyramid  of  its employees  is  balanced,  giving  young  people  as  well  as older employees their full place. Particular attention is paid to integration programs for young people.\n\nPrograms to educate teams about difference and training programs  to  avoid  unconscious  bias  when  recruiting  are also deployed.\n\n\u00cb\n\nFor  example,  since  2019,  the  Latin  America  region  has developed a program called 'diversity and inclusion' that incorporates gender mix, ethnic origins (especially vulnerable populations), disability, and social and economic  inclusion.  A  communication  campaign  has accompanied  the  approach  on  the  theme  'with  respect, we understand each other.'\n\nIn North America, the focus is on raising awareness among HR  teams  and  writing  inclusive  job  descriptions  to promote  diversity  in  recruitment.  Partnerships,  networks and mentoring programs are deployed.\n\nIn  India,  mentoring  programs  for  the  inclusion  of  women are being deployed and a women's network are active.\n\n## D - Employee satisfaction\n\nIncreasing employees' involvement in a context of change, both  generational  and  technological,  is  an  essential challenge for the Group. To meet this challenge, the Group places managerial attitude and involvement at the heart of this approach: managers motivate and develop the loyalty of  employees  by  giving  more  meaning  to  their  everyday work and by favoring a spirit of initiative.\n\nSince 2019, a unique tool to measure  employee commitment has been developed. It makes it possible to conduct surveys targeted on particular populations and/or themes,  for  example,  specifically  listening  to  managers during  the  transformation  phases.  This  platform  is  also used  to  conduct  the  annual  global  survey  sent  to  all employees:  'me@Saint -Gobain.'  Employees  are  asked questions  covering  the  five  main  focus  areas  of  the  HR policy and the current transformation programs:\n\n- \u00b7 Team: an energizing, collaborative working environment;\n- \u00b7 Active: an empowering organization;\n- \u00b7 Talent: an HR organization focused on talent development;\n- \u00b7 Management: a management style based on influence;\n- \u00b7 Inspiration: sharing clear objectives and a factual vision.\n\nWith  a  participation  rate  of  87%  in  2023,  126,470 employees  took  part.  In  particular,  85%  of  them  would recommend Saint -Gobain as a good place to work.\n\nDespite a slight erosion, the level of commitment remains stable in a difficult environment.\n\nThe commitment rate reached a score of 83%, down one point compared with the survey conducted in 2022. This index groups the results into four themes:\n\n- \u00b7 Pride in working for Saint -Gobain;\n- \u00b7 Short-term retention capacity;\n- \u00b7 Recommendation;\n- \u00b7 The  feeling  of  being  appreciated  and  valued  for  their work.\n\nIn  accordance with the HR organization, each country or Business  Unit  is  able  to  obtain  results  for  its  own  scope and is  responsible  for  circulating  the  results  and  starting dialog with employees to define action plans to work on areas requiring improvement.",

        "page_content": "## 3.5.4 COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT\n\nThe  various  Saint -Gobain  entities,  in  their  respective scopes and in line with their key local issues, are active in sponsorship  and  philanthropy  in  the  Group's  reference markets,  and  also  in  areas  such  as  education,  research, culture and health. To develop these actions, Saint -Gobain relies  on  local  partnerships,  in  particular  with  non-profit organizations and charities.\n\nSaint -Gobain invested 16,4 million in 2023 for philanthropy and  sponsorship  actions.  This  involves  either  direct financial support or donations of materials. Each entity and each  country  makes  its  own  choices  to  support  projects according to local issues. This takes the form of financial donations, donations of materials, skill-based sponsorship, or volunteer work. All of these actions with a local social impact  are  not  systematically  reported  by  the  Group  at the global level. Only a portion of financial donations and donations  of  materials  is  reported.  The  number  of beneficiaries  is  also  only  partially  assessed.  The  financial impact  does  not  include  skill-based  sponsorship  or employees'  participation  in  voluntary  work  during  their working hours.\n\nIn  2022,  Saint -Gobain  launched  a  program  called  \"Build Change\" to federate commitment around two priorities:\n\n- \u00b7 Supporting  the  youth  training  in  the  construction sector;\n- \u00b7 Promoting access to decent and sustainable housing.\n\nThis  program  encourages  young  people,  especially  the most  disadvantaged,  to  join  the  construction  industry, which in many countries is facing labor shortages.\n\nSimilarly, there is a chronic lack of decent housing for the most  disadvantaged  populations.  Improving  access  to insulated housing also allows these vulnerable populations to reduce their energy bills and improve comfort.\n\nWhile  the  Build  Change  program  guides  part  of  the actions, each country undertakes supplementary programs  to  support  vulnerable  populations  in  local communities.\n\n## A - A network of actors contributing to inclusive actions\n\nAt a central level, the Saint -Gobain International Corporate Foundation is based on employee commitment. All Group employees - both current and retired - can sponsor acts of solidarity in two areas:\n\n- \u00b7 The  professional integration of young  adults  in difficulty;\n- \u00b7 The  construction,  improvement  or  renovation,  in  the general interest, of living spaces  for  people  in precarious  situations,  contributing  in  particular  to reducing  energy  consumption  and  preserving  the environment.\n\nA better living for all\n\nProjects must be carried out by a non-profit organization and be located near a Saint -Gobain site.  The  Foundation provides direct financial support to the projects selected, thanks to an annual allocation of \u20ac2 million invested in the projects. In addition, current  employee  and  retired employee  sponsorships  help  charities  access  additional partnerships  such  as  donations  of  materials,  access  to technical  expertise  in  energy  efficiency  and  other  areas, and volunteer work.\n\nSince its creation in 2008, the Foundation has supported 387 projects, including 35 in 2023.\n\nEach  country  organizes  its  activities in the most appropriate  way  according  to  the  local  situation.  Some, such  as  the  United  States  or  India  created  local foundations to develop programs to engage employees in philanthropic actions or actions to help vulnerable populations.\n\nOther countries rely on dedicated local teams committed to bringing programs and initiatives to life.\n\n## B - Training for the construction sector to accelerate the transition to sustainable construction\n\n## a.  Train our clients' employees\n\nTraining programs for our clients' employees are developed in most countries where Saint-Gobain operates. In  France,  a  complete  training  catalog,  via  e-learning  or face-to-face,  is  available  for  all  clients  of  the  Group.  The Isover,  Placo\u00ae  and  Weber's  teams  offer  programs  led  by experts trained in teaching methods. Some of the courses are  certifiable.  In  Brazil,  a  complete  offer  regrouping  17 programs is deployed under the form of 285 sessions per year.  Finally, in some countries, Saint-Gobain teams travel to  worksites.  This  is  the  case  for  Weber  teams  in  France and certain training courses in Morocco.\n\nSaint-Gobain  PAM  has  also  set  up  a  \"customer  school\" offering  a  range  of  training  courses  in  the  water  and wastewater sectors. These courses can be given on site.\n\n## b.  Train a qualified workforce\n\nIn North America, the Group has developed a partnership with the NGO YouthBuildUSA to meet a twofold ambition: to  provide training in the sustainable housing industry to young people struggling with the school system, all while enabling them to obtain a high school diploma. Since 2011, the Group has been helping to integrate young people into the construction industry and raise their awareness of the sector.\n\nLikewise, Saint -Gobain UK and Ireland supports Barnardo's YouthBuild  Academy,  which  aims  to  train  unemployed young  people  in  building  trades  at  a  time  when  the construction industry is facing labor shortages.\n\n<!-- image -->",

This training program,  launched  in  2003  and  financially supported since 2016 by YouthBuild International, aims to share the know-how of Group employees with unemployed  youth  from  disadvantaged  communities, through  a  combination  of  theoretical  courses  and  the achievement of a local renovation project. The 'Saint -Gobain  YouthBuild  Academy'  is  the  only  CETA (Construction  Education  Training  Authority)  accredited training  provider  with  accreditation  to  facilitate  the National Certificate: Ceiling & Partition Installation NQF 3. The Group sustainably supports youth employment while contributing to the dynamism of its business sector. Since its  creation,  about  1,000 people have benefited from this program.\n\nSince November 2021, Saint -Gobain in Morocco developed its  own  academy  with  the  same  objective  of  training young people in the building trades and in particular in the evolution of techniques related to sustainable construction.  Qualifying  training  courses  are  provided  in three training centers.\n\nIn  France  in  2022,  Saint -Gobain  developed  a  network  of schools  to  train  qualified  workers  for  jobs  in  the construction sector that are in short supply. The specialized banners have formed  partnerships with apprentice training centers (CFA) to develop professional training courses, such as the roofing school for roofers set up  by  Asturienne,  the  builder's  school  set  up  by  Point.P and  the  thermal  engineering  school  set  up  by  CEDEO. Training programs are deployed region by region. By the end  of  2023,  33  classes  will  have  been  opened  and 350  apprentices recruited. The target is to train 3,000 craftsmen within 5 years.\n\nSeveral  professional  training  programs  are  on  offer  in India. For example, the Gyproc Academy has trained more than 1,150 young people since its creation in 2013, with a placement rate of over 90%.\n\nFor  many  years,  Saint-Gobain  has  been  supporting  craft trades by being a partner of Worldskills France, the trades competition that enables young professionals from all over the world to showcase their skills.  For the 2023 edition, in line  with  the  actions  taken  to  raise  awareness,  promote and  train  future  generations  of  roofers,  masons  and plumbers  with  the  Ecole  du  Toit,  L'\u00e9cole  des  B\u00e2tisseurs and  19\u00b0  L'Ecole  du  g\u00e9nie  climatique  respectively,  the Asturienne, POINT.P and CEDEO trade names, like Placo\u00ae, have  supported  the  building  trades  competitors  by donating  equipment  to  enable  them  to  compete  in  the best possible conditions.\n\n\u00cb\n\n## C - Actions in favor of education\n\nIn  addition  to  programs  supported  by  the  Saint -Gobain Foundation, many countries have set up partnerships for youth training.\n\nIn  France,  Saint -Gobain  inaugurated  an  apprenticeship training center (CFA)  in 2020, called 'Generation Saint -Gobain.' This center offers training courses focused on  jobs  in  short  supply,  industrial  maintenance  and  sales and  marketing.  In  2022,  a  supply-chain  management certifying training course was successfully carried out.\n\nIn India, the Saint -Gobain India Foundation supports more than  9,500  young  girls  in  targeted  education  programs. Saint -Gobain has also developed programs to accompany young people from rural areas.\n\n## D - Actions in favor of decent and sustainable housing\n\nIn  2022,  nearly  35  projects  in  favor  of  access  to  decent and  sustainable  housing  in  over  15  countries  were conducted.  These  actions  are  often  carried  out  in collaboration  with  non-profit  organizations  operating  in the same regions.\n\nPartnerships  with  Habitat  for  Humanity  have  been established  in  many  countries  in  Latin  America,  such  as Argentina and Brazil, and in Europe, such as Poland.\n\n## E - Other actions in favor of communities\n\nIn emergency  situations,  Saint -Gobain's local teams mobilize to support the populations affected. For example, Saint -Gobain  teams  in  Poland  have  continued  to  help Ukrainian.  Families  were  taken  in  and  are  still  being supported.  A  foundation  has  been  set  up  to  provide financial assistance to the refugees and to help them with the  administrative  process.  Finally,  psychological  support is available to employees in Poland to help them cope with this  situation.  In  2023,  many  countries  faced  natural disasters.  Saint-Gobain  teams  mobilized  in  Turkey  and Morocco during the earthquakes.\n\nIn  Turkey,  a  program  to  provide  shelter  for  earthquake refugees  led  to  the  construction  of  more  than  150 temporary  homes.  Group  employees  in  many  countries supported  the  donations  made  by  Saint-Gobain  entities. Unfortunately,  another  earthquake  struck  Morocco  in September.  Saint-Gobain  teams  in  Morocco  mobilized  to provide  immediate  aid  in  the  form  of  basic  necessities. Support  continued  by  participating  with  a  charity  in  a program  to  build  temporary  housing.  This  program  is supported by the Saint-Gobain Foundation.",

The  Region's operating  margin  hit  a  new  annual  record-high  of  8.2% (versus  7.8%  in  2022),  thanks  to  an  optimized  business profile  and  very  well  managed  costs  and  industrial efficiency.\n\nIn Nordic  countries, the  sharp  fall  in  new  construction, particularly  in  Sweden  and  Norway,  was  partly  offset  by our exposure to renovation. Saint-Gobain further differentiated its offer in 2023, with the commercial launch of  Klima  plasterboard  manufactured  at  its  Fredrikstad\n\n## OPERATING INCOME(\u20acm) and MARGIN (%)\n\nplant in Norway using 100% hydroelectric power. The UK outperformed a downbeat market, benefiting from strong sales  momentum  thanks  to  the  success  of  its  local organization and comprehensive range of solutions along with  a  newly  optimized  portfolio. Germany continued  to suffer  in  a  difficult  macroeconomic  environment  which weighed  on  new  construction;  Saint-Gobain  launched  a closed-loop  recycling  service  for  Isover  insulation  and Rigips  plasterboard  in  the  country  in  2023.  In Eastern Europe, volumes progressed in the fourth quarter, driven by  our  comprehensive  range  of  interior  and  exterior solutions.\n\n## B - Southern Europe - Middle East & Africa: resilient sales and margin growth\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSALES (\u20acm)\n\nOPERATING INCOME(\u20acm) and MARGIN (%)\n\nrates\n\nrates\n\nFinancial results\n\n<!-- image -->",

The operating margin for the Region performed  well,  at  8.1%  (versus  8.0%  in  2022),  thanks  to very well managed costs and industrial efficiency.\n\nAmid  a  sharp  decline  in  new  construction,  Saint-Gobain continued to outperform in France thanks to its exposure and  extensive  expertise  in  renovation,  supported  by regulatory tailwinds and the increase in stimulus measures, both  for  private  housing  (the  MaPrimeR\u00e9nov'  household renovation package, which was raised from \u20ac2.7 billion for 2023 to \u20ac4 billion for 2024) and for programs related to public and commercial buildings. The Group continues to enhance  its  offering,  with  dedicated  initiatives  for  major eco-certified projects, high value-added low-carbon solutions,  and  white  papers  on  its  complete  offering  for healthcare and educational facilities and the renovation of multi-family housing.\n\nIn  line  with  the  introduction  of  the  Extended  Producer Responsibility  (EPR)  regulation  in  2023  on  end-of-life management  of  construction  waste,  the  Group  has ramped up its recycling services with Saint-Gobain Glass\u00ae Recycling, Placo\u00ae Recycling and Isover\u00ae Recycling, thanks to the start-up of a new-generation furnace for recycling glass wool from construction waste at Chemill\u00e9.\n\n- In Spain and Italy , sales  were  up  in  broadly  resilient construction markets, and the Group launched Placotherm\u00ae Integra, a comprehensive  light fa\u00e7ade solution offering thermal insulation and acoustic protection using Glasroc\u00ae X technology.\n\nMiddle East and Africa enjoyed strong growth, especially in Turkey - where the acquisition of Dalsan created a new leader in light and sustainable construction solutions - and in Egypt, where the Group's growth accelerated thanks to the  acquisition  of  Drymix  in  construction  chemicals. Saint -Gobain also enhanced its building envelope offering in  Saudi  Arabia  through  its  acquisition  of  Izomaks  in construction chemicals (waterproofing products).\n\n## C - Americas: sales growth in North America and record margin\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSALES (\u20acm)\n\nThe Region delivered 1.9% organic growth in 2023, driven by  the  outperformance  in  North  America.  Operating income hit a new record-high (\u20ac1.6 billion), along with its operating  margin  at  16.8%  (versus  16.1%  in  2022), supported  by  well-managed  costs  and  productivity,  and the upturn in volumes in North America.\n\n- \u00b7 North  America reported 5.3% organic  growth  over the year (8.7% as reported, including the integration of  Kaycan,  Building  Products  of  Canada  and  GCP's waterproofing  membranes)  in  a  new  construction market that  has  stabilized.  Good  momentum  in  the second  half  of  the  year  drove  a  significant  rise  in volumes and Saint-Gobain saw further market share gains  thanks  to  its  comprehensive,  differentiated range  of  interior  and  exterior  light  construction solutions.  The  integrations  of GCP and Kaycan are making  particularly  good  progress,  enabling  us  to achieve the expected  synergies.  The Building Products  of  Canada acquisition  was  completed more quickly than expected, as of September 2023, allowing  Saint-Gobain  to  reinforce  its  leadership  in Canada in construction materials with a comprehensive  range  of  interior and exterior solutions.  In  light  of  the  favorable  growth  outlook,\n\n\u00cb\n\n## OPERATING INCOME(\u20acm) and MARGIN (%)\n\ncapital  expenditure  increased  in  North  America, totaling over \u20ac350 million in 2023.\n\n- \u00b7 Latin America was down by 7.3% in 2023. Despite a difficult macroeconomic climate throughout the year in Brazil ,  the volume decline eased towards the end of the period - thanks to the outperformance of light construction  solutions  -  and  some  macroeconomic indicators are improving  (falling  interest  rates, inflation  under  control,  stimulus  plan).  Saint-Gobain saw  market  share  gains  in  Mexico  and  benefited from  the  highly  successful  integration  of  Impac (construction chemicals: waterproofing). Other countries benefited from an increase in sales prices, an  enriched  mix,  and  a  geographic  footprint  and product range extended by bolt-on acquisitions. The Group  has  successfully  replaced  25%  of  its  natural gas with biogas at its glass plant in Jacarei near S\u00e3o Paulo,  and  100%  at  its  mortars  plant  in  Rio  de Janeiro.\n\nrates",

In total, the Group has benefited from more than 120 decarbonized electricity contracts in 2023;\n- \u00b7 Reduction in energy consumption by 4% between 2022 and  2023.  Today,  the  energy  consumed  is  still  largely derived from fossil fuels, and considering the impact of energy  on  carbon  emissions,  Saint-Gobain  favors  the transition  to  decarbonized  energies  by  changing  its energy mix.\n\nNon-financial results\n\n## EVOLUTION OF SCOPE 1 AND 2 EMISSIONS BY REGION (MT CO2E)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u00b7 A 13% reduction in the quantity of water abstracted and a  28%  reduction  in  discharges,  in  line  with  targets  set for  2030,  and  an  increase  in  the  proportion  of  water reused in production processes to 88% (84% in 2022). These  efforts  are  essential  to  anticipate  the  already significant  increase  in  2023  in  the  number  of  sites  in zones of extreme risk of water stress (from 79 in 2022 to 108 sites in 2023). In 2023, 42 of these 108 sites will have achieved the 0 discharge target (vs. 34 in 2022);\n- \u00b7 A  9%  reduction  in  waste  generation  compared  with 2022,  and  a  14%  reduction  in  the  quantity  of  nonrecovered waste. This is thanks to the ongoing efforts of  our  teams,  investments  in  systems  for  recycling residues in production, and active research into external waste  recovery  networks  to  avoid  incineration  and landfill.\n\n<!-- image -->",

General  Management  promotes  and  disseminates  a  culture  of  ethics  and  compliance, demonstrating its commitment to ethical and responsible business practices.\n\n- \u00b7 As every new manager receives training in ethical issues upon joining the Group, by 2023 almost 99% of all managers will have received training in the Code of Ethics and competition rules, and over 99% will have received training in anticorruption;\n- \u00b7 ESG criteria are integrated into compensation packages: the weight of ESG in compensation packages is 10% in the short-term  portion  (addition  of  the  CO2  emissions  reduction  criterion  to  safety  in  2021)  and  20%  in  the  long-term portion (increase in the CO2 emissions reduction criterion from 5% to 10%, in 2021 with the other criteria of safety and diversity accounting for 5% each);\n- \u00b7 The risk maps related to responsible purchases and those related to human rights have been updated and are based on  recognized  external  sources,  providing  a  more  precise  identification  of  issues  and  locations  to  prioritize  in  our actions;\n- \u00b7 The new professional alert system allows for easier reporting and analysis of alerts. Thus, while the number of alerts has doubled  since  its  implementation  in  2019  (from  537  to  1101),  half  of  the  alerts  have  been  deemed  inadmissible  or unconfirmed, but all are subject to review.\n\n## BREAKDOWN OF ALERTS IN 2023\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

If these appointments are approved by  the  General  Meeting  of  June  6,  2024,  the  Board  of Directors  would  be  composed  of  82%  of  independent directors,  37%  foreign  directors  (excluding  employee directors and employee shareholders, in accordance with the Afep-Medef Code), and 55% women.\n\n## C - Independence, diversity policy and representation of employee shareholders and employees on the Board of Directors\n\n## a) Independence\n\nThe  Board  has  carried  out  the  annual  review  of  each Director's situation as of February 1, 2024, with regard to the  independence  criteria  set  out  in  the  Afep-Medef Corporate Governance Code for French listed companies, with which the Company complies, at the proposal of the Nomination and Remuneration Committee.\n\nAs  every  year,  during  its  meeting  of  February  29,  2024, the Board of Directors, scrutinized, with vigilance and with the  same  attention  as  the  other  criteria,  the  business relationships  that  may  exist  between  the  Saint -Gobain Group  and  the  other  entities  or  groups  where  each director  holds  an  executive  management  position  or chairmanship of a corporate administrative or supervisory body: Mr. Jean-Dominique Senard, Chairman of the Board of  Directors  of  Renault,  Mr.  Gilles  Schnepp,  Chairman  of the Board of Directors of Danone, Mrs. Dominique Leroy, member  of  the  Board  of  Directors  and  Europe  Chief Executive Officer of Deutsche Telekom AG, Mr.  Jean -Fran\u00e7ois  Cirelli,  Chairman  of  BlackRock  France, Belgium and Luxembourg, and Mr. Thierry Delaporte, Chief Executive  Officer  of  Wipro  Limited.  The  Board's  review, described  below,  concluded  that,  with  the  exception  of Mrs.  Dominique  Leroy  and  Mr.  Jean-Dominique  Senard, none of these Directors, nor any company or group within which  they  hold  office  as  senior  executives  or  exercise Board chairmanship functions (or supervisory board) has any business relationship with Compagnie de Saint -Gobain, its Group or its management.\n\nAs  no  business  relationships  exist  between  the  groups Danone,  BlackRock  or  Wipro  Limited,  on  the  one  hand, and  Saint -Gobain,  on  the  other  hand,  the  Board  of Directors conducted a quantitative and qualitative review of the situation of Mrs. Dominique Leroy and Mr.  Jean -Dominique  Senard  and  of  business  relationship between  Deutsche  Telekom  and  the  Renault  Alliance (Renault,  Nissan,  Mitsubishi),  on  the  one  hand,  and Saint -Gobain, on the other.\n\nBusiness  flows  between  the  Saint -Gobain  and  Deutsche Telekom  groups  represent  less  than  0.1%  of  their respective  consolidated  revenues,  all  activities  combined and  worldwide.  Between  the  Renault  Alliance  and  the Saint -Gobain  group,  business  flows  represent  less  than 0.1% of Renault's consolidated revenues and less than 0.5% of  Saint -Gobain's  consolidated  revenues,  all  activities combined and worldwide. These figures are well below the 1% materiality threshold set by the Board of Directors. In addition,  the  Board  of  Directors  noted  that,  given  the\n\n\u00cb\n\nOther offices held outside the Group and expired over the past five years",

Furthermore, Mrs. Dominique Leroy and Mr. Jean -Dominique Senard, in their capacity as Directors of  the  Saint -Gobain  Group,  have  no  direct  or  indirect decision-making power in the establishment or maintenance  of  these  business  relationships.  If  however such  an  issue  were  to  be  discussed  at  a  Board  meeting, the  Board's  internal  rules  provide  for  rules  on  the management  of  conflicts  of  interest,  under  which  the Director  concerned  would  have  the  duty  to  inform  the Chairman  of  the  Board  of  Directors  and  the  Lead Independent Director of his or her situation and to abstain from participating in the discussions and deliberations on the matter in question (see section 9.1.1 B, p. 402).\n\nOn  the  basis  of  the  above,  the  Board  of  Directors considered that Mrs. Dominique Leroy and Mr.  Jean -Dominique  Senard  do  not  have,  directly  or indirectly,  any  significant  business  relationships  with  the Group  that  could  affect  their  freedom  of  judgment  or independence.\n\nNote  that  Mr.  Jean-Fran\u00e7ois  Cirelli  is  a  director  as  an individual and not as a representative of BlackRock, which held 8.07 % of the capital and 7.33% of the voting rights of the  Company (2) as  of  December  31,  2023  .  Furthermore, Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Cirelli was not appointed on the proposal of BlackRock. In addition, for the purposes of exercising the voting rights attached to the shares of the Company held\n\nComposition and operation of the governing bodies\n\nby BlackRock, BlackRock has given a mandate to a third party  who  exercises  these  voting  rights  on  behalf  of BlackRock so that (i) Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Cirelli cannot influence the exercise by BlackRock of its voting rights and that (ii) BlackRock  cannot,  based  on  its  status  as  a  shareholder and  the  related  voting  rights,  influence  Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Cirelli's performance of his duties as a director.\n\nRegarding the absence of conflicts of interest of members of  the  Board  of  Directors  and  the  Company's  entry  into agreements subject to the procedure set out in Article L. 225-38 of the French Commercial Code, see the section on conflicts of interest and declarations relating to members of the Board of Directors, section 5.1.1.D, p. 188.\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors  concluded  from  its  review  of Directors'  independence  against  the  criteria  set  down  by the  Afep-Medef  Code  that,  as  of  February  1,  2024,  eight directors  out  of  11  (i.e.,  73%)  completely  satisfied  the independence  criteria  and  were  therefore  considered  to be independent directors: I\u00eada Gomes Yell, Pamela Knapp, Agn\u00e8s Lemarchand, Dominique Leroy, Jana Revedin, JeanFran\u00e7ois  Cirelli,  Thierry  Delaporte  and  Jean-Dominique Senard.  In  compliance  with  the  recommendations  of  the Afep-Medef Code, the employee directors and employee shareholders  were  not  included  in  calculating  that proportion.\n\nThe table below summarizes the results of the independence  review  of  each  Director  in  relation  to  the criteria set out in the Afep-Medef Code.\n\n<!-- image -->",

are foreign nationals (excluding employee  directors and employee  shareholders, in accordance  with  the  Afep-Medef  Code).  In  addition,  the majority  of  directors  have,  or  have  had,  very  strong international exposure, managing groups with a significant proportion  of  their  activities,  or  exercising  significant duties, outside of France (see biographies in section 5.1.1,A p. 174).\n\nAs part of its self-assessment of the work of the Board of Directors in 2023  (see section 5.1.2,E p. 191), the Board of Directors, taking into account in particular the appointments to be proposed to the General Meeting of 6 June  2024,  assessed  its  composition  very  positively  in terms  of  diversity,  age,  experience,  complementarity  of sectoral  and  functional  skills  and  noted  the  rejuvenation, the  internationalization  and  diversification  of  the  Board (see biographies in section 5.1.1, p. 174).\n\n\u00cb\n\nThe  Directors  considered  that  it  would  be  desirable  to continue to reduce the age and broaden the international scope  of  the  Board  of  Directors  as  part  of  future replacements  of  directors  in  2025  based  on  the  needs resulting  from  the  analysis  of  the  skills  matrix  by  the Nomination  and  Remuneration  Committee  by  promoting the following research areas:\n\n- \u00b7 Serving executive corporate officer,\n- \u00b7 Good knowledge of the world of construction, materials and industry,\n- \u00b7 Financial experience,\n- \u00b7 International experience,\n- \u00b7 Foreign director.\n\nLastly, the Board of Directors intends to maintain balanced numbers  of  men  and  women  (see  the  paragraph  on 'Gender parity' below).",

In  accordance  with  the law,  Mrs.  Sibylle  Daunis  Opfermann,  who  represents employee  shareholders,  and  employee  representatives Mrs.  Lydie  Cortes  and  Mr.  Philippe  Thibaudet  are  not counted when calculating this proportion. Including them, the Board of Directors has 50% women.\n\n## d) Representation of employee shareholders and employees\n\nMrs.  Lydie  Cortes  and  Mr.  Philippe  Thibaudet  were appointed  as  Employee  Directors  by  the  Company's Works Council ( Comit\u00e9 de Groupe ) in accordance with the Company's bylaws. These were amended by the General Shareholders' Meeting of June 7, 2018, to provide for the appointment of two Employee Directors regardless of the size of the Board of Directors, even though, given its size, the  law  only  required  the  appointment  of  one  Employee Director.  This  initiative,  in  anticipation  of  the  Pacte  Law published  in  May  2019,  is  fully  in  line  with  Saint -Gobain's culture of social dialog.\n\nSibylle  Daunis  Opfermann  was  appointed  as  director representing  employee  shareholders  in  accordance  with the  appointment  procedures  in  the  Company's  bylaws.\n\nSibylle Daunis Opfermann, Chairwoman of the Supervisory Board  of  the  'Saint-Gobain  PEG  France' (3) collective employee  shareholding vehicle ( fonds commun  de placement d'entrepris e), was nominated as a candidate by this Supervisory Board. This candidacy was supported by the  Supervisory  Board  of  the  'Saint-Gobain  PEG  Monde' corporate mutual fund, which did not propose any other candidates,  nor  did  the  employees  holding  registered shares.  Sibylle  Daunis  Opfermann  was  reappointed  as director  representing  employee  shareholders  by  the Combined General Meeting of June 3, 2021. Her term will end at the close of the General Meeting called to approve the  financial  statements  for  the  fiscal  year  ending December 31, 2024.\n\nEmployee  directors  and  employee  shareholders  also receive  training  appropriate  for  the  performance  of  their duties.  These  internal  or  external  training  courses  are organized by the Company, which is solely responsible for them.\n\nThe  Employee  Directors  and  the  Director  representing employee  shareholders  are  members  of  the  Board  of Directors in the same way as the other Directors and have voting rights.  Subject  to  the  laws  applying  specifically  to them, these Directors are subject to all legal and statutory provisions,  have  the  same  rights  and  are  subject  to  the same duties, as fixed, in particular, by the Board's internal rules, as those applicable to the other Directors.\n\n<!-- image -->",

On  the  proposal  of  PierreAndr\u00e9  de  Chalendar,  the  Board  unanimously  decided  to appoint  Benoit  Bazin  as  Chief  Executive  Officer,  with effect  from  July  1,  2021 (1) .  Pierre-Andr\u00e9  de  Chalendar would  continue  to  serve  as  Chairman  of  the  Board  of Directors.  At  the  time  of  his  reappointment  in  2022,  he indicated that he would serve as Chairman for a maximum of  two  years,  i.e.,  no  later  than  the  General  Meeting  of June 6, 2024.\n\nBenoit  Bazin  had  also  been  appointed  director  of Compagnie  de  Saint-Gobain  by  the  General  Meeting  of June 3, 2021.\n\nThis  corporate  governance  structure  ensured  a  smooth and successful transition in the context of the process of succession of Pierre-Andr\u00e9 de Chalendar, which began in 2019,  when  Benoit  Bazin  was  appointed  Deputy  Chief Executive Officer and continued with his appointment as Chief Executive Officer on July 1, 2021.\n\nDuring  the  transition  period,  the  Board  of  Directors conducted  in-depth  work,  under  the  supervision  of  the Lead  Independent  Director  and  the  Chairman  of  the Board, in conjunction with the Nomination and Remuneration Committee. The Nomination and Remuneration  Committee  focused  its  work  on  the recomposition  of  the  Board  following  the  conclusions  of the  2022  assessment  and,  to  this  end,  appointed  a  a specialist consultant to select candidates for director roles to be proposed to the General Meeting.\n\nIn addition to informal contacts between Board members, this in-depth work included the following steps:\n\n- \u00b7 the Lead Independent Director, Jean-Dominique Senard,  met  with  all  the  members  of  the  Board  of Directors  during  the  Board's  assessment  in  October 2021 and October 2022;\n- \u00b7 in October 2022, during the assessment of the Board of Directors  by  a  specialist  consultant,  the  consultant interviewed all the directors individually;\n- \u00b7 the Lead Independent Director, Jean-Dominique Senard, chaired 'executive sessions' without  the presence  of  the  Chief  Executive  Officer  in  November 2021, November 2022, and November 2023 concerning the Company's governance structure;\n- \u00b7 in September 2023, the Lead Independent Director and the  Chairman  of  the  Board,  in  the  presence  of  the members  of  the Nomination and Remuneration Committee,  heard  from  a  law  firm  specializing  in governance;\n- \u00b7 in  October  2023,  the  Lead  Independent  Director  and the  Chairman  of  the  Board  met  with  all  the  Board members again;\n- \u00b7 in November 2023, Benoit Bazin presented his vision of the  Group's  governance  to  the  Lead  Independent Director and the Chairman of the Board in the presence of  the  members  of  the  Nomination  and  Remuneration Committee;\n- \u00b7 in  November  2023,  the  Lead  Independent  Director chaired an 'executive session' without the presence of the  Chief  Executive  Officer,  during  which  he  reported on Benoit Bazin's presentation. This 'executive session' resulted in a unanimous consensus among the directors on  the  combined  roles  of  Chairman  of  the  Board  of Directors and Chief Executive Officer and the appointment  of  a  Lead  Independent  Director  with greater authority.\n\n## c) Combination of roles starting on June 6, 2024, at the end of the transition period\n\nFollowing the in-depth work described above carried out by  the  Board  of  Directors  under  the  supervision  of  the Lead  Independent  Director  and  the  Chairman  of  the Board, and in order to have the governance structure best suited  to  its  ambitions  and  challenges  and  opportunities that arise, without any bias in principle on the structure to be adopted, the Saint-Gobain Board of Directors unanimously  decided  on  November  23,  2023,  not  to change  the  structure  that  existed  prior  to  the  transition period with the combined roles of Chairman of the Board of Directors (2) and Chief Executive Officer. It thus decided:\n\n- \u00b7 appoint Benoit Bazin as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer with effect from the General Meeting of June 6, 2024;\n- \u00b7 that Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Cirelli, an independent director since 2020,  would  be  appointed  as  Lead  Independent Director and Vice Chairman of the Board at the end of that  general  meeting  called  to  vote  on  Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Cirelli's reappointment as a director;\n- \u00b7 that  the  authority  of  the  Lead  Independent  Director would be increased (see below and section 9.1.1B p 402;\n\n<!-- image -->",

This will ensure clear, embodied of the Group's management as well as optimal alignment between the strategic objectives validated  by  the  Board  of  Directors  and  their  effective implementation in a decentralized, multi-location international organization. Combining the roles means that we can make the most of the momentum we have built up thanks to the recent simplification of the Group's chain of command, with a presence in more than 75 countries and a single CEO responsible for each of them. It also provides proximity,  responsiveness,  simplicity  and  stability  for  the teams, directors and shareholders.\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors  also  took  into  account  the  skills and experience of Benoit Bazin, who, beyond his strategic vision  and  deep  knowledge  of  the  Group,  demonstrated his ability to move the culture of Saint-Gobain forward and successfully  transform  the  Group  in  terms  of  both  its scope of activities and its operational, financial, social, and environmental performance, maintaining a regular, constructive dialog with the directors.\n\nHe  also  took  into  account  the  views  expressed  by  the various employee representatives within it.\n\nAs was the case during Pierre-Andr\u00e9 de Chalendar's term, the  Board  of  Directors  will  continue  to  discuss  the appropriateness  of  the  existing  governance  structure  as part of the evaluation of its work.\n\n## d) Reinforcement of checks and balances within the Board of Directors\n\nAs  part  of  its  work,  the  Board  of  Directors  decided  to appoint  a  new  Lead  Independent  Director  and,  aware  of the expectations of investors, set out to increase both the authority  of  the  Lead  Independent  Director  and  the independence of the Board of Directors.\n\nThe Board of Directors, taking into account the development of the  practice  within  companies  in  France chaired  by  a  combined  Chairman  of  the  Board/CEO  and the expectations of certain investors expressed during the Company's dialog with them, had created the role of Lead Independent  Director  in  June  2017,  a  position  held  by Mr.  Jean-Dominique  Senard,  an  independent  director, since that date. This role had been maintained during the transition  period  since  the  Chairman  of  the  Board  of Directors, Pierre-Andr\u00e9 de Chalendar, was not independent.\n\n## Appointment of a new Lead Independent Director\n\nIn  view  of  the  end  of  Jean-Dominique  Senard's  term  of office following the General Meeting of June 6, 2024, and the  decision  to  have  combined  roles  of  Chief  Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board, the Board decided at its  meeting  of  November 23, 2023, to entrust the role of Lead  Independent  Director  and  Vice  Chairman  of  the Board to Mr. Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Cirelli, an independent director, following that Meeting and subject to his reappointment at the General Meeting of June 6, 2024.\n\n\u00cb\n\nThe  selection  of  Jean-Fran\u00e7ois  Cirelli  was  gradually established  during  the  governance  process  described above,  carried  out  under  the  supervision  of  JeanDominique S\u00e9nard, Lead Independent Director, in conjunction  with  the  Nomination  and  Remuneration Committee, which focused its work on the recomposition of the Board of Directors.\n\nJean-Fran\u00e7ois  Cirelli  has  both  knowledge  of  the  industry and  governance  issues  from  his  previous  executive  roles and knowledge of Saint-Gobain from being on the Board of  Directors  for  nearly  four  years.  He  also  has  strategic skills,  highlighted  by  his  role  in  one  of  the  main  strategy firms, governance skills given his accumulated experience as  a  director  of  companies,  and  strong  shareholder sensitivity from his responsibilities within one of the largest asset  managers  in  the  world  (see  biography  in  5.1.1.A p.  174).  For  the  purposes  of  exercising  the  voting  rights attached  to  the  Company's  shares  held  by  BlackRock, BlackRock  has  appointed  a  third  party  to  exercise  these voting rights on its behalf (see  5.1.1.C p. 184).\n\nFurthermore,  the  Board  of  Directors  considered  that  the exclusively  non-executive  duties  performed  by  JeanFran\u00e7ois  Cirelli  outside  Saint-Gobain  did  not  represent  a position  that  could  conflict  with  his  future  role  as  Lead Independent Director.\n\n## A Lead Independent Director with enhanced powers starting from the General Meeting of June 6, 2024\n\nThe General Meeting of June 6, 2024, will be called to vote on an amendment to the Company's bylaws to make the appointment  of  a  Lead  Independent  Director  and  Vice Chairman  of  the  Board  mandatory  if  the  roles  of  Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of Directors are combined or if the Chairman of the Board of Directors is not independent.\n\nThe Lead Independent Director's main responsibility is to oversee the efficient running of the Company's governance bodies. Effective June 6, 2024, he will serve as Vice  Chairman  of  the  Board  of  Directors,  reflecting  the importance of his role.\n\nThe internal rules of the Board of Directors, which will be applicable starting from the close of the General Meeting of  June 6, 2024, provide that he will be in charge of the duties  and  have  the  resources  listed  below.  The  items  in italics and underlined below reflect the extensive reinforcement  of  the  duties  and  means  of  the  Lead Independent Director in the internal rules of the Board of Directors  that  will  apply  starting  from  the  close  of  the General  Meeting  of  June  6,  2024,  compared  with  the internal rules applicable before that date:\n\n## Duties:\n\n- \u00b7 prevent and manage conflicts of interest;\n- \u00b7 assess the organization and operation of the Board of Directors, distinguishing between the assessment of the Chairman  and  the  assessment  of  the  Chief  Executive Officer;\n- \u00b7 serve  as  a  point  of  contact  for  shareholders  of Compagnie de Saint-Gobain and contribute to shareholder  engagement  on  governance  issues;  lead governance Road Shows ; and\n- \u00b7 in  conjunction  with  the  Chairman  of  the  Board  of Directors, ensure that the directors receive the information they need to perform their duties  and  act as  their  spokesperson with the Chairman of the Board when necessary;\n- \u00b7 more  generally,  ensuring  compliance  with  the  internal rules of the Board of Directors.",

Of  particular  Note  is  the Lead Independent Director's right to ask the Chairman to convene  a  meeting  of  the  Board  of  Directors,  the Chairman being bound by the Lead Independent Director's request.\n\n## B - Activities of the Lead Independent Director during fiscal year 2023\n\nThe  Lead  Independent  Director  carried  out  his  activities during fiscal year 2023 in accordance with the duties and means  described  in  the  internal  rules  of  the  Board  of Directors applicable during that fiscal year (voir  9.1.1.B p. 402).\n\nIn  2023,  the  Lead  Independent Director attended nine of the 10 meetings of the Board of Directors and three of the four  meetings  of  the  Corporate  Social  Responsibility Committee, of which he is a member.\n\nAt the meeting of the Board of Directors on February 29, 2024,  Mr.  Jean-Dominique  Senard  presented  a  review  of his  activity  as  Lead  Independent  Director  for  fiscal  year 2023. His work especially consisted of:\n\n- \u00b7 working  with  the  Chairman  of  the  Board  of  Directors and in conjunction with the Nomination and Remuneration Committee to perform the in-depth work of the Board of Directors on the Company's governance structure (see above);\n- \u00b7 working  with  the  Nomination  and  Remuneration Committee  to  examine  the  independent  status  of  the Directors  in  light  of  the  criteria  set  out  in  the Afep -Medef  Code  (including  through  the  review  of conflict-of-interest  questionnaires  and  the  analysis  of business relationships);\n- \u00b7 discussing the succession plan for the Chief Executive Officer in the event of a vacancy with the Chairman of the Board of Directors;\n- \u00b7 conducting  the  assessment  of  the  organization  and operation of the Board and its Committees, which took place as follows in January and February 2024:\n- -the  Lead  Independent  Director  reviewed  the  draft questionnaire  to  be  submitted  to  the  directors prepared  by  the  General  Secretary  as  well  as  the answers  provided,  all  Directors  having  had  the opportunity to discuss them with the Lead Independent Director;\n\n<!-- image -->",

Thus, each year, the Chief Executive Officer leaves the sessions of the Board and the Nomination and Remuneration Committee during  such  discussions  (deliberations  and  votes)  on issues  involving  the  assessment  of  his  performance  and the  setting  of  his  variable  compensation  (February sessions),  as  well  as  during  the  Board's  assessment,  of governance  issues,  and  on  his  long-term  compensation scheme  (November  sessions).  In  November  2023,  a meeting  of  the  Board  of  Directors  was  held  exclusively without  the  presence  of  the  Chief  Executive  Officer,  as well as in November 2022.\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors  intends  to  continue  to  meet  in 2024  without  the  presence  of  the  executive  corporate officers  to  discuss  governance  issues  more  generally, beyond  the  issues  of  executive  corporate  officers' compensation  and  the  Board  assessment.  As  indicated above,  the  internal  rules  of  the  Board  that  will  apply following  the  General  Meeting  of  June  6,  2024,  includes new provisions relating to executive sessions that may be held at the end of Board meetings or at any other time.\n\n## c) Prior and ongoing information for directors\n\nAt each meeting, the Board is provided with an analysis of the  Saint -Gobain group's operating income and net debt situation, prepared as of the end of the month preceding the meeting.\n\nBetween  meetings,  the  Directors  receive  copies  of  all press releases issued by Compagnie de Saint -Gobain and, as the case may be, any relevant information about events or transactions that are material for Saint -Gobain. They are entitled  to  request  any  other  documents  they  consider necessary to make an informed contribution to the Board's discussions; requests are put to the Chairman of the Board of Directors, who may submit the request to the Board for a decision.\n\nThe  Chairman  of  the  Board  of  Directors  and  the  Lead Independent Director ensure that the Directors receive the information  they  need  to  perform  their  duties  under  the best possible conditions.",

He  or  she  must  also  consult  the  Board before  accepting  any  new  appointment  in  a  listed company. A director should not hold more than four other directorships in listed companies, including foreign companies,  not  affiliated  with  his  or  her  group.  This recommendation applies at the time of appointment or the next  reappointment  of  the  director  in  question.  The director  must  keep  the  Board  of  Directors  informed  of directorships held in other companies, including his or her participation  in  Board  committees  of  these  French  or foreign companies.\n\nTo the best of the Board's knowledge, all these rules are respected by all the directors.\n\nIn  addition,  and  as  shown  by  the  attendance  rate  of directors  at  meetings  of  the  Board  and  its  Committees (see  attendance  table  above),  the  directors  have  a  very high attendance rate. The various offices held by each of them allow the directors to devote the necessary time and attention to their duties.\n\nThe principal topics discussed during Board meetings are listed below.\n\n## Monitoring of the Group's strategic orientations, its geographical presence and its business lines\n\nAt  each  meeting  except  for  meetings  held  on  the  same day as the General Shareholders' Meeting, consistent with its  internal  rules,  the  Board  of  Directors  analyzed  the Group's  situation.  In  addition,  during  each  of  these meetings,  including  a  full-day  seminar  dedicated  to  the presentation  of  the  Group's  strategy,  the  Board  of Directors  reviewed  and  approved  the  Group's  strategic orientations  or  examined  its  pipeline  M&A  or  a  specific aspect of the strategy, such as:\n\n- \u00b7 comparison with the main competitors;\n- \u00b7 the  position  of  a  business  or  a  region  after  having heard,  if  relevant,  an  operational  manager  from  the relevant business lines or regions;\n- \u00b7 a particularly important industrial investment ;\n- \u00b7 presentation of the CO2 roadmaps, innovation, digital.\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors  also  examined  the  proposed disposals, in particular the finalization of the disposal of its distribution  activity  in  the  United  Kingdom  (see  section 1.4.5 p. 41). It also  reviewed  proposed  acquisitions, including  that  of  Building  Products  of  Canada  Corp.  and Dalsan (see section 1.4.5 p. 41).\n\nIn addition, it examined  the  Group's  geographical exposure,  particularly  with  regard  to  the  war  in  Ukraine and its consequences.\n\nThe Board of Directors also monitored the progress of the Group's cost reduction and operational excellence measures year on year.\n\n## Financial management\n\nPursuant to its  legal  competency,  the  Board  of  Directors approved the annual and consolidated financial statements for the 2022 fiscal year and the consolidated financial statements for the first half of 2023, the various reports  relating  to  them,  as  well  as  the  strategy  and\n\n\u00cb\n\noutlook for 2023 and 2024, after hearing the opinions of the Chairwoman of the Audit and Risk Committee and the Statutory  Auditors.  The  Board  also  approved  the  draft resolutions submitted to the General Shareholders' Meeting  of  June  8,  2023,  in  particular  the  proposed dividend  distribution,  and  the  reports  made  available  to shareholders, and convened the meetings of shareholders and holders of participating shares. It approved the report on payments made to Governments (extractive industries).\n\nIt approved  the  Group's  2023  budget  presented  by Mr. Benoit Bazin and the various provisional management reports and documents and renewed the annual authorizations  granted  to  the  Chief  Executive  Officer  to issue bonds, sureties and guarantees. It also reviewed and updated,  on  the  proposal  of  the  Audit  and  Risk Committee,  the  procedure  applicable  to  the  current agreements  entered  into  under  normal  terms  and conditions  and  examined  the  related-party  agreements approved  or  entered  into  during  the  fiscal  year  2023  or previous fiscal years, the execution of which was ongoing during fiscal year 2022.\n\nIt  approved  the  implementation  of  the  Company's  share buyback program.\n\n## Internal control and risk management\n\nThe Board of Directors undertakes an annual review of the internal  control  and  risk  management  processes  in  force within  the  Group,  following  analysis  of  the  mapping  of major financial and non-financial risks updated in 2023 by the  Audit  and  Internal  Control  Department,  and  after hearing  the  report  of  the  Chairwoman  of  the  Audit  and Risk Committee on these topics.\n\nIn particular, the Board of Directors and the Audit and Risk Committee examine and monitor the continued roll-out of the Saint -Gobain group cybersecurity plan. It was decided to implement, following the 2017 NotPetya cyberattack, an annual  monitoring  plan  and  a  general  external  audit  of Saint -Gobain  Group's  IT  at  the  request  of  the  Audit  and Risk  Committee.  This  audit  was  conducted  annually  over the  period  2018-2021.  In  2022,  sufficient  progress  had been  made  in  order  to  move  to  a  permanent  and automated control system. In this context, audits will now be  conducted  every  two  years.  The  most  recent  audit, conducted  in  early  2023,  found  that  Saint-Gobain  had  a good  level  of  maturity  in  this  area  and  confirmed  or defined the actions to be taken in this area. In addition to external audits, Saint -Gobain has obtained certifications at the  level  of  some  of  its  activities  or  factories  (SOC2 certification for GCP, TISAX certification for several HighPerformance Solutions factories).\n\nIt was also informed of the compliance program.\n\nIn addition, it examined  the  Group's  geographical exposure (see above).\n\nOn  several  occasions,  it  reviewed  the  position  of  the Company  and  Group  with  regard  to  certain  risks  in particular,  procedures,  litigation,  and  related  provisions (notably in relation to asbestos, competition, the Grenfell Tower  fire  in  the  United  Kingdom,  and  PFOA)  and  the evolving regulatory environment.\n\nFinally,  the  Board  of  Directors  reviewed  the  services assigned  to  the  Statutory  Auditors  and  their  network  as authorized by the Audit and Risk Committee.",

With  regard  to  gender  diversity,  the Board  of  Directors  has  noted  the  progress  made  and new measures were adopted in 2020 and 2022, on the proposal  of  the  General  Management,  setting  gender diversity  targets  within  the  management  bodies  of Compagnie  de  Saint -Gobain  and  its  subsidiaries  by 2025:  namely  40%  women  hired,  25%  women  senior executives, 30% women on the Executive Committee of Compagnie  de  Saint -Gobain,  and  on  the  Executive Committees of the Business Units, and 40% of women overall on the boards of the Business Units. To achieve these  targets,  it  was  decided  to  require  that  at  least 40%  of  new  hires  be  women  and  require  gender diversity  among  spokespersons.  The  monitoring  of these objectives was discussed at the Board meeting of November 2023;\n- \u00b7 presentation  of  the  results  of  the  me@Saint -Gobain 2022  survey,  a  tool  for  assessing  and  managing  the Group's transformation, with more  than  125,000 employees responding to this survey;\n- \u00b7 various actions in favor of inclusions, such as solidarity actions  facing  emergency  situations  (war  in  Ukraine), the  implementation  within  the  Group  of  diversity  and inclusion programs with the objective of considering all types  of  potential  discrimination  (gender,  disability, social and ethnic origins, etc.), and the development of training  in  construction  trades  with  multiple  societal and  inclusive  actions  and  operations  adapted  to  the challenges, local needs and cultures.\n\nIn April 2023, the directors took part in training organized specifically for them by the Climate Change Group, which involved each of them taking part in the Climate Fresk.\n\nThis  collaborative  workshop  based  on  IPCC  data  was designed to enable each director to better understand the workings, scale and complexity of issues posed by climate change.\n\nComposition and operation of the governing bodies\n\nIt is recalled  that  the  Directors  had  participated  in seminars  in  February  2018,  April  2019,  April  2020,  April 2021,  and  April  2022  devoted,  respectively,  to  climate change and its consequences for companies, the circular economy and its challenges for companies, the transformation of energy and industrial systems in a zerocarbon economy, biodiversity and 'The City of the Future'.\n\n## Governance\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors  made  decisions  regarding  the governance  of  the  Company  following  the  transition period initiated in 2021 (see section 5.1.2.A p. 191 above).\n\nIn accordance with the Afep-Medef Corporate Governance Code  for  listed  companies  and  under  the  supervision  of the  Lead  Independent  Director,  the  Board  formally conducted  the  annual  assessment  of  its  operations  and discussed  the  results  of  this  assessment  (see  the assessment  of  the  Board's  performance  in  section  5.1.2, p. 191).\n\nIt  satisfied  itself  that  a  succession  plan  for  the  Chief Executive  Officer,  in  the  event  of  an  unforeseeable vacancy, exists and has been implemented.\n\nThe Board of Directors reviewed the situation of Director independence.  At  the  proposal  of  the  Nomination  and Remuneration Committee, it also discussed changes in its size and composition due to the expiration of the terms of office of certain Directors.\n\nLastly, it  ruled on the training program for the Employee Directors.\n\n## Compensation of corporate officers and long-term incentives for executive corporate officers and employees\n\nThe Board established:\n\n- \u00b7 at  its  meeting  of  February  23,  2023,  the  general principles of the compensation policy for the Chairman of the Board and the Chief Executive Officer for fiscal year 2023; and\n- \u00b7 at its meeting of February 29, 2024, for the 2024 fiscal year (see section 5.2.1, p. 205), the general principles of the compensation policy for:\n- -the Chairman of the Board of Directors and the Chief Executive  Officer  for  the  period  from  January  1, 2024,  until  the  end  of  the  General  Shareholders' Meeting of June 6, 2024; and\n- -the  Chairman  and  Chief  Executive  Officer  for  the period  from  the  close  of  the  General  Meeting  of June 6, 2024, to December 31, 2024.\n\nIn particular,  it  reviewed  and  approved  the  various components  of  the  compensation  of  Mr.  Benoit  Bazin (fixed portion, variable portion and long-term compensation instruments) and the respective balance of those various components.\n\nAt  its  meeting  of  November  23,  2023,  the  Board  also decided to implement and approve the main characteristics of the 2023 performance share plan and set the  performance  criteria  of  that  plan  that  may  benefit executive  corporate  officers  and  certain  categories  of employees (see section 5.2.4, p. 240).\n\nAs  part  of  the  ongoing  development  of  employee shareholders,  the  Board  resolved  to  again  offer  its employees  and  former  employees  the  opportunity  to subscribe  to,  under  certain  conditions,  a  capital  stock increase reserved for them in 2024, up to a maximum of 6.5 million shares, i.e., approximately 1.28 % of the capital stock (see section 7.1.6 , p. 285).\n\n<!-- image -->",

Further, in its examination of the composition of the  Committees  and  appointment  of  new  Directors  to these Committees, the Board ensures compliance with the recommendations of the Afep-Medef Code with regard to the proportion of independent  Directors  on  these Committees.\n\nIn  view  of  the  Board  reappointments  and  appointments planned  and  forthcoming  in  2025,  the  Board  and  the Nomination  Committee  will  review  the  changes  to  be made  to  the  composition  of  each  of  the  Committees  as part of their work.\n\n## Audit and Risk Committee\n\n## Composition\n\n| President   | Pamela Knapp                    |\n|-------------|---------------------------------|\n| Members     | I\u00eada Gomes Yell                 |\n| Members     | Agn\u00e8s Lemarchand Gilles Schnepp |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n\u00cb\n\nAs of February 1, 2024, three of the four members of the Audit  and  Risk  Committee  are  independent  Directors (75%),  including  its  Chairwoman.

These assessments are conducted with the assistance of outside consultants (as in 2022) every three years.\n\nIn the intervening years, it is carried out on the basis of a questionnaire sent to each of the Directors.\n\nIn line with best practices allowing the Directors to receive feedback on their individual contribution, the assessment also includes the following three stages:\n\n- \u00b7 confidential review of each Director's individual contribution  by  the  Chairman  of  the  Nomination  and Remuneration Committee, the Lead Independent Director and the Chairman of the Board of Directors;\n- \u00b7 individual review for each Director with the Chairman of the Board of Directors; and\n- \u00b7 the  option  for  every  Director  to  request  feedback  on his/her individual contribution from the Chairman of the Board or the Lead Independent Director.\n\nMoreover,  the  detailed  questionnaire  to  which  each director responds, which concerns the functioning performance  of  the  Board  in  particular,  allows  them  to freely  express  their  assessment  of  the  other  directors' individual  contributions  if  they  wish  to  do  so.  The directors' individual contributions are also closely examined by the Nomination and Remuneration Committee, and then by the Board, on the occasion of the reappointment of the directors and recomposition of the Committees, as needed.\n\n\u00cb\n\nThe  Directors  who  are  members  of  a  Board  Committee also  report  on  the  operation  of  the  Committees  in  which they participate.\n\nThe organization of the 2023 assessment was decided by the Board at its meeting of October 6, 2023, on the Lead Independent  Director's  proposal.  The  sitting  14  Directors as  of  that  date  were  consulted  and  participated  in  the Board  assessment  work.  The  Lead  Independent  Director conducted the self-assessment and reported on the results of  this  assessment  by  making  proposals  at  the  Board meeting of February 29, 2024.\n\n## General observation\n\nThe Board's assessment of the working process relating to the choice of governance demonstrated that the directors were  very  satisfied  with  the  process  put  in  place.  The number, schedule, and conduct of the executive sessions concerning  the  choice  of  governance  were  deemed satisfactory, allowing discussions (i) between the directors and (ii) between the directors and the Lead Independent Director and the Chairman of the Board.\n\nThe  directors  also  unanimously  emphasized  the  role played  by  the  Lead  Independent  Director  and  the Chairman of the Board in the in-depth work carried out by the Board as well as the very successful completion of the transition period provided  by  Mr.  Pierre-Andr\u00e9  de Chalendar, as Chairman of the Board, and Mr. Benoit Bazin, as  Chief  Executive  Officer,  this  transition  period  having made it possible to note that the Chief Executive Officer was  ready  to  assume  the  duties  of  Chairman  and  Chief Executive Officer.\n\nThe  directors,  taking  into  account  in  particular  the appointments  that  will  be  proposed  to  the  General Shareholders'  Meeting  on  June  6,  2024,  judged  very positively  the  composition  of  the  Board  of  Directors  in terms  of  diversity,  age,  experience,  and  complementarity of sectoral and functional skills, and noted the rejuvenation,  internalization,  and  diversification  of  the Board of Directors.\n\nAlmost unanimously, the directors underscored the quality of the discussions by the Board of Directors and its open functioning. The  functioning  of  the  Board  and  its committees was considered to be very satisfactory and its collaborative, transparent, and fluid nature was noted.\n\nWith  regard  to  strategic  topics  such  as  M&A  monitoring and  the  decision-making  process  regarding  acquisitions, the  directors  are  completely  satisfied  with  the  quality  of the information made available to the Board of Directors on  potential  acquisitions  and  divestments,  as  well  as  the fluidity  and  openness  of  discussions  on  the  various projects.  In  addition,  it  was  noted  that  strategic  issues were dealt  with  on  an  ongoing  basis  at  each  meeting  of the Board of Directors and that the strategic seminar was highly useful on all the issues dealt with by the Board of Directors.\n\nThe directors are also of the opinion that the information they receive regarding follow-up on the main disputes is satisfactory.\n\nIn general, the directors noted the quality of monitoring of corporate  social  responsibility  issues  by  the  Corporate Social Responsibility Committee  and  the  Board  of Directors. The directors emphasized the quality of training modules  on  environmental  and  climate  issues  and,  more generally, on corporate social responsibility.",

In particular, they were as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 implement  a  work  process  involving  one  or  more executive  sessions  concerning  the  governance  and succession  of  the  Chairman  of  the  Board  and/or  the Lead Independent Director, depending on the scenario selected;\n- \u00b7 continue to reduce the age and broaden the international  scope  of  the  Board  as  part  of  future renewals,  particularly  those  of  Committee  Chairmen/ Chairwomen,  over  a  three-year  period,  based  on  the needs resulting from the analysis of the skills matrix by the Nomination and Remuneration Committee and the Board, particularly by promoting the following research areas:  one  or  several  serving  executive  corporate officers  or  with  such  experience  within  other  major groups,  a  serving  Chief  Financial  Officer,  a  Director from  the  construction  value  chain  and/or  a  Director with climate change skills; and\n- \u00b7 regularly  address  financial,  digital  and  commercial matters in the Board's work.\n\nAs indicated above, the directors indicated that they were satisfied  with  the  process  implemented  regarding  the mode of governance.\n\nIn addition, they considered that the appointment of Jana Revedin  in  June  2023  and  the  appointments  of  Sophie Brochu, H\u00e9l\u00e8ne de Tissot, and Geoffroy Roux de B\u00e9zieux to be proposed to the General Meeting on June 6, 2024, meet  the  above  criteria.  Taking  these  appointments  in particular  into  account,  they  considered  the  composition of  the  Board  very  positively  in  terms  of  diversity,  age, experience,  complementarity  of  sectoral  and  functional skills  and  noted  the  rejuvenation,  internationalization  and diversification  of  the  Board  while  identifying  the  search focuses presented below for future appointments in 2025.\n\nLastly,  financial,  digital,  and  commercial  matters  were considered  to  have  been  handled  professionally  and comprehensively.\n\nComposition and operation of the governing bodies\n\nIn  order  to  sustain  progress,  the  Board  adopted  the following  conclusions  on  the  proposal  of  the  Lead Independent Director, resulting from the assessment:\n\n- \u00b7 Composition of the Board of Directors: continuing the rejuvenation  and  internationalization  of  the  Board  of Directors during the 2025 replacement of directors, by favoring the following search focuses:\n- i. Serving executive corporate officers;\n- ii. Good  knowledge  of  the  world  of  construction, materials and/or industry;\n- iii. Financial skills;\n- iv. International experience; and\n- v. Foreign director.\n- \u00b7 Role and responsibilities of the Chairman of the Board of Directors\n- i. Working on the format of the strategic seminar;\n- ii. Providing updates on the following topics: the use of AI in the Group; adapting to climate change; light and sustainable construction methods; off-site construction;\n- iii. Preparing successions for Committee chairs;\n- iv. Holding  a  joint  meeting  of  the  Audit  and  Risk Committee  and  the  Corporate  Social  Responsibility Committee on non-financial reporting topics.\n\n## F - Director integration pathway\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors  meets  once  a  year  at  a  Group's plant or research center.\n\nEach new Director may ask for training on the topic of his or  her  choice  and  visit  the  Group's  plants,  distribution facilities  or  research  centers.  In  this  context,  the  new Directors may also visit various industrial sites or Building Distribution  sites,  and  any  Director  may  meet  with members of the Executive Committee at his or her request (see section 1.1.2  p. 14).\n\nFurthermore,  in  accordance  with  the  law,  Employee Directors benefit from supplementary training, the content of which is set every year by the Board of Directors, after consultation of such Employee Directors.\n\nThe  Director  representing  employee  shareholders  also received such training.\n\n<!-- image -->",

They also ensure that it evolves taking into account the Group's performance and average compensation within the Group and market practices.\n\nThe  compensation  package  of  the  executive  corporate officers  is  determined  by  taking  into  account  all  pay components (fixed compensation, annual variable compensation, long-term incentives,  severance  indemnity and pension benefits), with a view to achieving a balanced mix of these components.\n\nWhen setting the various components of the compensation  of  the  executive  corporate  officers,  the Board  of  Directors  also  takes  into  consideration  the comments of the Company's shareholders during constructive discussions and also benchmarks of CAC 40 1 companies and CAC 40 industrial companies 2 .\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors  also  seeks  to  ensure  that  the granting  of  long-term  compensation  instruments  (stock options, performance shares and performance units, as the case may be) to the executive corporate officers in a given fiscal year does not represent a disproportionate share of their maximum total compensation in respect of that fiscal year  and  has  conditioned  these  grants  to  demanding ceiling and holding rules.\n\n## Compensation and benefits allocated to the executive corporate officers\n\n## Summary of the compensation and benefits paid or granted to the executive corporate officers for the 2023 fiscal year\n\nIn accordance with the principles set out above, the Board of  Directors,  at  its  meeting  of  February  23,  2023, approved,  on  the  proposal  of  the  Nomination  and Remuneration  Committee,  the  compensation  policies  for the  Chairman  of  the  Board  of  Directors  and  the  Chief Executive Officer for the fiscal year 2023.\n\nThese policies were approved by the General Shareholders'  Meeting  of  June  8,  2023  (ninth  and  tenth resolutions).\n\nThe following tables present a summary  of  the compensation,  performance  shares  and  stock  options granted to Mr. Pierre-Andr\u00e9 de Chalendar, Chairman of the Board of Directors and Mr. Benoit Bazin, Chief Executive Officer, for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2022 and 2023.

It  is  expressed  as  a percentage of the annual fixed compensation.\n\nAt  its  meeting  of  February  23,  2023,  on  the  proposal  of the Nomination and Remuneration Committee, the Board decided, for fiscal year 2023, to set the cap for the annual variable portion of the compensation of Mr. Benoit Bazin, as Chief Executive Officer, at 170% of the fixed portion of his compensation.\n\nFurthermore,  at  its  meeting  of  February  23,  2023,  the Board determined, on the proposal of the Nomination and Remuneration Committee, the components and objectives of the variable compensation of Mr. Benoit Bazin as Chief Executive Officer for 2023 as follows:\n\n## A quantifiable portion of 75%, based on financial objectives (60%) and CSR objectives (15%):\n\n- \u00b7 With  regard  to  quantifiable  financial  objectives,  the Board  decided  to  select  four  objectives,  considered relevant  for  assessing  the  operational  and  financial performance  of  the  Group  and  its  strategy,  each accounting for 25%:\n- -the  FCF  (Free  Cash  Flow),  which  is  an  indicator published  and  monitored  by  investors  and  which replaces the 'OFCF' objective (Operating Free Cash Flow), which is an internal indicator;\n- -ROCE (Return on Capital Employed);\n- -the Group's operating income; and\n- -Group recurring net income per share.\n\nThe objectives  for  the  above  quantifiable  criteria  are  not disclosed for confidentiality reasons.\n\n- \u00b7 Given  the  volatility  of  the  environment  in  which  the Group  operates,  which  makes  it  difficult  to  forecast each indicator, the Board of Directors, after consulting the Nomination and Remuneration Committee, reserves the  right  to  apply  an  'outperformance'  mechanism unchanged  from  2022,  which  would  allow  partial\n\nCompensation of the management and governing bodies\n\ncompensation for the non-achievement of quantifiable objectives on certain criteria by exceptional outperformance on others. In the event of outperformance  on  one  or  more  of  the  four  criteria beyond the maximum, it is possible to reach up to 20% of  the  bonus  share  relating  to  the  outperforming criterion/criteria, in the event of achievement above the maximum  and  up  to  120%  of  the  maximum,  with linearity between 0 and 120% (which leads, for example, to 10% of the bonus share relating to a criterion in the event of achievement of up to 110% of the maximum), it being  specified  that  the  sum  of  the  four  components may not exceed 102% (4) of  the  fixed  portion.  Thus,  in the extreme case of outperformance of more than 20% of  the  maximum  on  three  criteria  and  performance equal to zero on the fourth, the quantifiable portion of the  annual  variable  will  be  equal  to  91.8%  of  the  fixed portion  (which  responds  to  the  concern  that  the maximum  of  102%  of  the  fixed  portion  cannot  be reached  when  one  criterion  is  at  zero).  In  2023,  as  in 2022, this mechanism was not applied given the strong performance on all financial criteria.\n\n- \u00b7 With regard to quantifiable CSR objectives, the Board decided to retain three objectives, each accounting for 5%:\n- -Carbon  objective:  reduction  of  CO2  emissions  (in scopes 1 and 2) versus 2022 at current scope (i.e., at actual production) (5) ;\n- -Safety objective: TRAR between 1.5 (maximum) and 1.8 (minimum); and\n- -Diversity and  teams  objective:  diversity index between 90% (maximum) and 85% (minimum) (6) .\n\nIt is  specified  as  necessary  that  the  outperformance mechanism  described  above  and  applicable  to  the financial  quantifiable  part  does  not  apply  to  the  CSR quantifiable part.\n\n## A qualitative portion of 25%,\n\n## based on the following three objectives:\n\n- \u00b7 Objective 1: stakeholders management;\n- \u00b7 Objective 2: continuing to optimize the Group's scope;\n- \u00b7 Objective 3: deployment of the Grow & Impact strategic plan in its six action priorities - 1 - Position ourselves in high-growth markets, 2 -Be Solutions-oriented, combining  performance  and  sustainability,  3  -  Drive growth  through  client  innovation  and  the  power  of data, 4 - Embedding Corporate Social Responsibility in our  decisions  and  actions,  5  -  Strengthen  our  TEC (Trust, Empowerment  and  Collaboration) culture (including maintaining high scores in the 2023 'me@Saint -Gobain'  survey),  and  6  -  Have  the  best teams  in  a  diverse  and  inclusive  work  environment, including  ongoing  actions  on  diversity  and  inclusion within the Group.\n\n<!-- image -->",

the Chief Executive Officer\n\nFor reasons of confidentiality, the limits of the quantifiable objectives  are  not  disclosed.  In  fact,  the  Group  does  not give any guidance on the objectives of CFL, ROCE, Group operating  profit  and  Group  net  current  profit  per  share. Disclosing  these  targets  would  therefore  be  likely  to mislead investors. For each objective, a target is set based on the budget, which is confidential by nature. The budget is ambitious.  In  2022  and  2023,  the  Group's  record performance has meant that rates financial targets are at their maximum.\n\nThus,  in  2022,  free  cash  flow  was  \u20ac3,791  million,  Group operating  income    \u20ac5,337  million,  ROCE  16.1%  and  net income  from  recurring  operations  per  share  \u20ac6.48.  In 2023, free cash flow was \u20ac3,910 million, Group operating income  5,251  million  euros,  ROCE  of  ROCE  15.8%,  and Group  net  income  from  recurring  operations  per  share \u20ac6.39.\n\nFor each quantifiable objective, the portion of the variable remuneration relating to it is triggered when the objective in  question  is  achieved,  depending  on  the  case,  between 90% and 86% of the target for the objective in question (based  on  the  budget),  and  reaches  its  maximum  when the  objective  reaches  between  106%  and  108%,  as appropriate, of the target for the objective in question.\n\n## Quantifiable variable CSR compensation for the Chief Executive Officer\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors,  at  its  meeting  of  February  29, 2024,  on  the  recommendation  of  the  Nominations  and Remuneration  Committee,  noted  that  the  level  of achievement of each of the quantifiable CSR objectives, as set out above, was 100%:\n\n\u00cb\n\n- \u00b7 Objective  Carbon:  the  Group  has  reduced  its  CO2 emissions from \"scopes\" 1 and 2 from 9.8 million tonnes in 2022 to 8.8 million tonnes in 2023.\n- \u00b7 Safety target: TF2 is 1.3 in 2023.\n- \u00b7 Diversity and team objective: the diversity index stood at 91% in 2023.\n\n## Qualitative variable compensation of the Chief Executive Officer\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors,  at  its  meeting  of  February  29, 2024,  on  the  recommendation  of  the  Nomination  and Remuneration Committee, set at 100% the overall level of achievement  of  the  three  qualitative  objectives  used  to determine the variable compensation  for  2023  of Mr.  Benoit  Bazin,  Chief  Executive  Officer,  as  outlined above.\n\nIn particular, it took the following main achievements into consideration:\n\n- \u00b7 With regard to stakeholders management, the Board of Directors noted the following points in particular:\n- -Regarding  the  external  visibility  of  the  Group's strategy,  image  and  representation,  the  Group's strategy  is clearly established  and  understood externally  by  stakeholders,  its  visibility  in  the  press has been further strengthened and a communication strategy has been deployed to establish Saint -Gobain as a leader in sustainable construction,\n- -As  far  as  investors  and  the  stock  market  are concerned,  the  Group's  image  is  very  positive, thanks  to  a  clear  strategy,  dialogue  with  Investors was very active and Saint-Gobain had one of its best years on the stock market in 2023, finishing second in terms of annual growth (+46%) in the CAC 40. In September  2023,  the  Group  also  returned  to  the EURO STOXX 50, which it had left in 2018,",

A  total  of \u20ac3 billion in sales has been divested by 2023 through 10 operations,\n- -With  regard  to  the  integration  of  acquisitions,  the integration of recent acquisitions is proceeding very satisfactorily,\n- -With  regard  to  acquisitions,  the  Group  completed 36  deals  in  2023,  bringing  in  additional  sales  of \u20ac0.9  billion,  with  significant  deals  in  emerging countries,  the  relative  weighting  of  the  Regions continues  to  evolve  in  order  to  reflect  more appropriately the economic and demographic weight of the various regions of the world;\n- \u00b7 Concerning deployment of the Grow & Impact strategic plan in its six action priorities (1 - Position ourselves in high-growth markets, 2 -Be solutions-oriented, combining  performance  and  sustainability,  3  -  Drive growth through customer innovation and the power of data, 4 - Embed Corporate Social Responsibility in our decisions and actions, 5 - Strengthen our \"TEC\" (Trust, Empowerment  and  Collaboration)  culture  (including maintaining high scores in the 2023 me@Saint-Gobain survey),  6  -  Have  the  best  teams  in  a  diverse  and inclusive  work  environment,  including  ongoing  actions on diversity and inclusion within the Group, the Group's actions are described in section 2.3, p. 78. The Board of Directors noted in particular:\n- -Acquisitions  in  North  America,  Asia,  Africa  and  the Middle East, accelerating acquisitions in the construction  chemicals  segment  (11  acquisitions  by 2023),  and  focusing  sales  and  R&D  efforts  on  the fastest-growing segments,\n- -The ramping up of Saint-Gobain Solutions organisations  in  the  main  European  countries  and the  pursuit  of  partnerships  with  key  accounts;  the launch in France of \"Les Engag\u00e9s\", a comprehensive range of sustainable, low-carbon solutions,\n- -Continued  deployment  of  innovation  initiatives around the key priorities  defined  in  2022,  with  two major  achievements  (on  the  product  side,  with Glasroc\u00ae X, offering a carbon footprint 2 to 3 times smaller  than  the  traditional  offering,  and  on  the industrial  process  side,  with  another  world  first involving  the  production  of  glazing  in  a  furnace fuelled  by  over  30%  hydrogen,  which  will  enable reduce CO2 emissions (scope 1) by up to 70%,\n\nCompensation of the management and governing bodies\n\n- -Increasing  internal  carbon  prices  from  \u20ac75  to  \u20ac100 per tonne for investment decisions and from \u20ac150 to \u20ac200  per  tonne  for  research  and  development projects; promoting water issues within the Group,\n- -The very good  results of the 2023 survey (\"me@SaintGobain\"), consolidating high scores on a still  broader  participation  base,  the  implementation of multiple initiatives to deepen the TEC culture, and\n- -The  Group's  award  of  the  \"Top  Employer  Global\" label for the ninth year running, and the continuation of local inclusion initiatives in each country.\n\n## In total, for the fiscal year 2023:\n\n- \u00b7 pursuant to the compensation policy approved by the General  Shareholders'  Meeting  of  June  8,  2023,  the compensation of Mr. Pierre-Andr\u00e9 de Chalendar was set at \u20ac450,000 gross per annum for the entire duration of his  term  of  office  as  Chairman  of  the  Board  of Directors. ;\n- \u00b7 Mr.  Benoit  Bazin's  total  compensation  (fixed  and variable)  as  Chief  Executive  Officer  amounted  to \u20ac2,700,000.  This  compensation  is  equal  to  that  of Mr. Benoit Bazin in 2022.\n\n## Long-term compensation policy\n\n## Grant cap in relation to the total compensation of the Chief Executive Officer\n\nIn addition to the constraints set out below, the Board of Directors  decided,  in  accordance  with  the  Afep-Medef Code,  that  the  long-term  compensation  instruments  that would  be  awarded  to  Benoit  Bazin  in  2023  could  not exceed a total of 75,000 shares.\n\nIn  2023,  the  75,000  performance  shares  allocated  to  Mr. Benoit  Bazin  amounted  to  a  total  value  (according  to IFRS), at the time of their grant, of \u20ac2,656,656, corresponding  to  98.4%  of  his  maximum  gross  total compensation for the 2023 fiscal year. In determining the allocation  for  the  2023  financial  year,  the  Board  of Directors took into account  the  Group's  excellent operational  and  non-financial  performance,  resulting  in strong share price growth and alignment with shareholders' interests.\n\nNo stock option or performance unit plan was implemented in 2023.\n\n## Grant cap to the Chief Executive Officer in relation to the overall grant\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors  decided,  during  its  meeting  of February  23,  2023,  as  in  previous  years,  that  the  Chief Executive Officer could not receive more than 10% of the overall grants of performance shares under the long-term compensation plan to be set up in 2023.\n\n## Hedging rules\n\nThe  Chief  Executive  Officer  formally  committed  not  to hedge  his  risk  either  on  stock  options  or  on  shares resulting from the exercise of stock options, on performance shares or on performance units he has been or  will  be  granted  during  his  term  of  office  as  executive corporate officer, until the cessation of his duties.

No  performance  units therefore became exercisable during fiscal year 2023.\n\n## Employment contract, retirement benefits and termination benefits for executive corporate officers\n\n## For the Chairman of the Board of Directors\n\n## TABLE 11 - EMPLOYMENT CONTRACT, RETIREMENT BENEFITS AND TERMINATION BENEFITS FOR THE CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS (AMF NOMENCLATURE)\n\n| Executive corporate officer                                     |     | contract   | Supplementary   | pension scheme   | Indemnities or benefits due  or likely to be due as a  result of termination or a  change of role   | Indemnities or benefits due  or likely to be due as a  result of termination or a  change of role   | Indemnities in relation  to a non-compete  clause   | Indemnities in relation  to a non-compete  clause   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------|-----|------------|-----------------|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|\n|                                                                 | Yes | No         | Yes             | No               | Yes                                                                                                 | No                                                                                                  | Yes                                                 | No                                                  |\n| Pierre-Andr\u00e9 de Chalendar,  Chairman of the Board of  Directors |     | X          |                 | X  (a)           |                                                                                                     | X                                                                                                   |                                                     | X                                                   |\n\nMr. Pierre-Andr\u00e9 de Chalendar benefits from the commitments made by the Group to him, as described below.\n\n## Health and personal risk insurance\n\nSee the heading 'Health and personal risk insurance' described hereunder.\n\n## For the Chief Executive Officer\n\n| Executive corporate officer   |     | contract   | Supplementary   | pension scheme   | Indemnities or benefits due  or likely to be due as a  result of termination or  change of duties   | Indemnities or benefits due  or likely to be due as a  result of termination or  change of duties   | Indemnities in relation  to a non-compete  clause   | Indemnities in relation  to a non-compete  clause   |\n|-------------------------------|-----|------------|-----------------|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|\n|                               | Yes | No         | Yes             | No               | Yes                                                                                                 | No                                                                                                  | Yes                                                 | No                                                  |\n| Benoit Bazin, CEO             |     | X  (a)     | X               |                  | X                                                                                                   |                                                                                                     | X                                                   |                                                     |\n\nMr. Benoit Bazin benefits from the commitments made by the Group to him, as described below.\n\n## Severance indemnity of Chief Executive Officer\n\nSee the heading 'Severance indemnity' described hereunder.\n\n## Non-compete indemnity\n\nSee  the  heading  'Non-compete  indemnity'  described hereunder.\n\n## Supplementary pension arrangements\n\nSee  the  heading  'Supplementary  pension  arrangements' described hereunder.\n\n## Health and personal risk insurance\n\nSee  the  heading  'Health  and  personal  risk  insurance' described hereunder.\n\n<!-- image -->",

This  cap,  which  defines  the  latitude  available  to  the Board  at  the  time  of  granting  long-term  compensation  instruments,  does  not necessarily prejudge the decision that will be taken in November 2024. This ceiling is unchanged from that of 2023.\n\nIn addition, the Board of Directors decided that the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer could not be allocated more than 10% of the overall grant of performance shares under the plan to be implemented in 2024 (no performance unit plan).\n\nAs  a  reminder,  the  sub-cap  for  the  allocation  of  stock  options  to  executive corporate officers was set by the General Shareholders' Meeting of June 2, 2022, at 10%  of  the  cap  set  by  the  seventeenth  resolution  (sub-cap  common  to  the eighteenth resolution of the same Meeting relating to the allocation of performance shares  which  itself  provides  for  a  sub-cap  for  allocation  to  executive  corporate officers of 10% of the cap in the resolution).\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors,  on  the  recommendation  of  the  Nomination  and Remuneration Committee, indicated to the General Shareholders' Meeting of June 2, 2022, its intention to submit the delivery of performance shares (the only long-term compensation instruments planned to be granted in 2024) subject to a presence condition and performance conditions that will be based at least on the following criteria historically applied to the Group's long-term compensation plans:\n\n- 1. an internal performance criterion (the Group's ROCE);\n- 2. a  relative  performance  criterion  (the  stock  market  performance  of  the Saint -Gobain share compared to the CAC 40 stock market index);\n- 3. a criterion relating to Corporate Social Responsibility.\n\nThese criteria were deemed relevant by the Board of Directors as they reflect the operational, financial and non-financial performance of the Saint-Gobain Group and ensure  that  the  beneficiaries  are  aligned  with  the  interests  of  Saint-Gobain shareholders.\n\nIf these criteria cease to be relevant, the Board would set criteria of a comparable requirement  in  order  to  continue  to  put  in  place  consistent  compensation instruments over the long term.\n\nThe performance objectives relating to each of the above criteria will be set by the Board  of  Directors  when  the  performance  shares  are  allocated  and  will  be  final. However,  the  Board  of  Directors  will  have  the  possibility,  after  consulting  the Nomination  and  Remuneration  Committee,  to  adjust  them  in  the  event  of exceptional circumstances justifying this, in particular in the event of a change in the Group's  scope  of  consolidation  or  a  change  in  accounting  method,  in  order  to neutralize, to the extent possible, the consequences of these circumstances on the objectives set on the grant date.\n\nThe assessment period for the performance conditions of long-term compensation instruments may not be less than three years.\n\nGiven  that  performance  shares  are  awarded  each  year  in  November,  the  criteria cannot be set as at the date of this document. As indicated above, the Board of Directors  intends  not  only  to  retain  the  criteria  historically  used  for  the  Group's long-term remuneration plans (unless they cease to be relevant), but also to apply the same rigour to the choice of limits as in the past. See section 5.2.4 p. 240 for the criteria applicable to the plan set up in November 2023.\n\nAs in the past, the Board will set for the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, for any  allocation  in  2024  as  part  of  a  long-term  compensation  plan  in  the  form  of performance shares, a strict obligation to retain shares or to reinvest in shares that the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer must hold in registered form until the end of his term of office.\n\n\u00cb",

        "page_content": "## Supplementary pension scheme -\n\nCompensation of the management and governing bodies\n\n## 2012 Plan:\n\nMr. Benoit Bazin benefits from the 2012 Plan, under the same conditions as those applicable to all beneficiaries of this pension plan.\n\nThe  2012  Plan  benefits  all  Compagnie  de  Saint-Gobain  employees  who  meet  the following  five  conditions:  (i)  have  at  least  ten  (10)  years'  seniority  within  the Saint -Gobain  Group  as  of  July  4,  2019,  (ii)  have  received  annual  compensation exceeding eight annual social security caps for at least three of the last ten years of employment prior to July 4, 2019, (iii) have completed their career as an employee of Compagnie de Saint-Gobain, (iv) have liquidated all of their retirement pensions, (v) have not been dismissed for gross misconduct.\n\nThe methods for determining the reference compensation set by the 2012 Plan and used to calculate the rights of beneficiaries are as follows: (i) base compensation consists exclusively of the following elements: fixed, variable and benefits in kind, and (ii) the base compensation taken into account for the calculation is an average of three consecutive years, including the highest over the last ten years of activity.\n\nThe 2012 Plan's benefit entitlement is calculated as follows: 1.8% of the portion of base  compensation  between  8  and  20  times  the  annual  social  security  cap,  plus 0.4%  of  the  portion  of  base  compensation  exceeding  20  times  the  annual  social security cap.\n\nThe amount of the supplemental pension provided by the 2012 Plan is capped twice:\n\n- \u00b7 by the number of years of seniority taken into account in the calculation, which cannot exceed 20. Only the years of presence of the potential beneficiary until December  31,  2019,  are  taken  into  account.  Thus,  to  determine  the  annual pension amount, the above-mentioned benefit entitlements are multiplied by the number of years of service, and\n- \u00b7 by an absolute cap: the pension may never exceed eight times the annual social security cap (i.e., \u20ac351,936 in 2023).\n\nIn addition, the annual amount of the supplementary pension provided for under the 2012  Plan  is  reduced  by  the  amount  of  other  defined-benefit  supplementary pensions received. Thus, the annual pension vested by beneficiaries of the 2012 Plan under  another  defined-benefit  plan,  such  as  the  2012/2  Plan,  reduces  the  annual rights that would be paid under the 2012 Plan by the same amount.\n\nSince Mr. Benoit Bazin joined the Saint-Gobain Group on September 1, 1999, he had reached the 20 years' service cap provided under the 2012 Plan in September 2019, and therefore, he would be unable to acquire any conditional rights under this plan as from that date.\n\nIn  the  event  of  departure  with  the  maximum  years  of  service  (acquired  in September  2019)  under  the  2012  Plan,  Mr.  Benoit  Bazin  would  be  entitled  to  an annual  pension  supplement  equivalent  to  30%  of  his  last  fixed  compensation. Mr. Benoit Bazin's maximum supplementary theoretical retirement payout is lower than the Afep-Medef Code's recommended cap, which is set at 45% of the sum of the fixed and annual variable compensations.\n\nThese  rights  are  financed  by  premiums  paid  to  an  insurance  company  which  are deductible from the corporate income tax base. With respect to the social security charges associated with the payment of the rights, the Company would be subject to  the  payment of a contribution based on the premiums paid to the insurer, the rate of which is set by the French Social Security Code at 24%.\n\nAt  December  31,  2023,  Mr.  Benoit  Bazin's  estimated  rights  under  the  2012  Plan would amount to around \u20ac300,000 per year, below the cap for the 2012 Plan (eight times the annual social security cap, i.e., \u20ac351,936 in 2023). This indicative amount is calculated in accordance with Article D. 22-10-16 of the French Commercial Code, according  to  which  the  rights  must  be  estimated  on  an  annual  basis,  take  into account the accumulated years of service of the corporate officer in his/her duties on  the  fiscal  year-end  date,  be  based  on  the  compensation  during  the  last  fiscal year(s) and be calculated disregarding the effective satisfaction of the conditions to which the commitment is subject, as if the corporate officer could benefit from it starting the day after fiscal year-end.\n\nThe commitments made by the company to Mr. Benoit Bazin under the 2012 Plan may be terminated by decision of the Board of Directors.\n\nThe 2012 Plan has been frozen as of December 31, 2019, such that no conditional rights  can  be  vested  after  that  date  in  accordance  with  Order  No.  2019-697  of July 3, 2019, relating to supplementary professional pension arrangements.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\nCompensation of the management and governing bodies\n\n## 2012/2 Plan:\n\nFollowing  this  freeze,  a  defined-benefit  supplementary  pension  plan  with  certain rights,  meeting  the  conditions  set  out  in  Article  L.  137-11-2  of  the  French  Social Security Code, the '2012/2 Plan', could be set up following the publication of the instruction of the Social Security Department on December 23, 2020. This 2012/2 Plan provides continuity to the 2012 Plan due to consistency in terms of population and benefits. Therefore, the 2012/2 Plan concerns only those employees who are in the workforce on its effective date and who benefit from the 2012 Plan. Moreover, the 2012/2 Plan is not an addition to the 2012 Plan but a gradual replacement of it. Indeed,  the  pension  rights  vested  annually  in  the  2012/2  Plan  reduce  the  frozen rights  in  the  2012  Plan  by  the  same  proportion  and  are  capped  so  that,  when combined as the case may be with the frozen rights of the 2012 Plan, they do not allow the receipt of a benefit greater than that which could have resulted from the 2012 Plan if its closure had not been imposed by the Order of July 3, 2019.\n\nThe 2012/2 Plan provides for the payment of a life annuity to the beneficiary, with the possibility of reversion, starting at the earliest from the date of liquidation of his pension in a compulsory old age insurance scheme to which he has contributed or from the legal retirement age mentioned in Article L. 161-17-2 of the French Social Security Code. After the life annuity has been settled, no new pension rights may be granted. In the event of death before the liquidation of the vested rights, the latter will be converted into capital and paid to the previously designated beneficiaries.\n\nThe reference compensation used to calculate the rights consists of the fixed and variable portions of the compensation as well as benefits in kind, taken into account for the calculation of social security contributions (pursuant to Article L. 242-1 of the French  Social  Security  Code).  For  the  calculation  of  the  reference  compensation, the  variable  portion  paid  for  the  year  in  question  is  capped  at  60%  of  the  fixed portion of the previous year's compensation.\n\nThe  rights  vested  annually  correspond  to:  5.4%  of  the  reference  compensation between  8  and  20  times  the  annual  social  security  cap  in  force  for  the  year  in question, plus 1.2% of the reference compensation exceeding 20 times the annual social security cap in force for the year in question.\n\nThe acquisition of annual rights is subject to compliance with conditions related to the beneficiary's professional performance, assessed annually by the employer. The rights  vested  annually  may  not  exceed  3%  of  the  reference  compensation.  In addition,  the  cumulative  number  of  percentage  points  applied  to  the  same beneficiary  under  a  scheme  covered  by  Article  L.  137-11-2  of  the  French  Social Security Code is capped at 30 points over the beneficiary's entire career and for all employers combined.\n\nFinally, in addition to these legal limits, the 2012/2 Plan has its own limit to ensure that  it  does  not  allow  the  beneficiary  to  receive  a  higher  benefit  than  that  which would have resulted from the 2012 Plan had its closure not been imposed by the Order of July 3, 2019. Thus, it is verified each year that the estimated rights vested under  the  2012/2  Plan  do  not  exceed  the  estimated  amount  of  the  'maximum' annual  rights  corresponding  to  the  rights  that  could  have  resulted  from  the  2012 Plan if its closure had not been imposed by the July 3, 2019, Order. If this cap is not observed, the grant of rights for the following year is null and void.\n\nIn  accordance  with  the  Chief  Executive  Officer's  compensation  policy  for  2022, approved by the Ordinary Shareholders' Meeting held on June 2, 2022 (thirteenth resolution),  the  application  of  the  2012/2  Plan  has  been  extended  to  Mr.  Benoit Bazin as of 2021.\n\nMr. Benoit Bazin's vesting of annual rights is subject to compliance with conditions related  to  his  professional  performance,  verified  and  validated  annually  by  the Board of Directors at the beginning of the year following the year concerned. The performance  condition  is  defined  as  follows:  the  achievement,  for  the  year  in question,  of  at  least  50%  of  the  individual  part  of  the  quantifiable  and  qualitative objectives relating to the variable portion of the compensation. Vesting may be zero (0%) in the year in which performance is below the threshold thus determined. The vested rights are revalued annually by a coefficient equal to the change in the social security cap. In the event of Mr. Benoit Bazin's departure from the Company, the rights will be revalued annually according to the technical and financial results of the insurer.\n\nThese  rights  are  financed  exclusively  by  premiums  paid  by  the  Company  to  an insurer,  which  are  deductible  from  the  corporate  tax  base.  As  regards  the  social security  charges  associated  with  the  payment  of  the  annuity,  the  Company  is subject to the payment of a contribution based on the premiums paid to the insurer, the rate of which is set by the French Social Security Code at 29.7%.\n\n\u00cb",

However, the rights prior to  this  termination  would  remain  vested,  in  accordance  with  the  applicable  legal provisions.\n\nOn February 29, 2024, the Board of Directors noted that the performance condition determining  the  vesting  of  Mr.  Benoit  Bazin's  rights  in  respect  of  2022  had  been met. As a result, under the 2012/2 plan, the rights vested in 2022 amount to a gross amount of approximately \u20ac37,000 per year. In addition, as of December 31, 2023, the total estimated amount of the pension that will be received by Mr. Benoit Bazin under the 2012/2 Plan amounts to a gross amount of approximately \u20ac109,000 per year.  This  indicative  amount  is  calculated  in  accordance  with  the  procedures  set forth  in  Article  D.  22-10-16  of  the  French  Commercial  Code.  As  indicated,  this amount reduces the  amount  that  could  be  paid  under  the  2012  Plan.  In  fact,  the estimated  amount  of  the  rights  paid  under  the  2012/2  Plan,  together  with  those which could be paid under the 2012 Plan, remains in any event lower than the cap provided  for  in  the  2012  Plan  (eight  times  the  annual  social  security  cap,  i.e., \u20ac351,936 in 2023) and the cap of 45% of fixed and variable compensation provided for in the Afep-Medef Code.\n\nPursuant to Article 5, II of the above-mentioned Order of 3 July 2019, the Board of Directors  reserves  the  right  to  transfer  the  commitments  of  the  2012  Plan  to  the 2012/2 Plan and to extend its application to Mr. Benoit Bazin. In any event, no rights would be transferred beyond the 30-point ceiling provided for in Article L. 137-11-2 of the Social Security Code, it being specified that this ceiling would be assessed by comparing the amount of the conditional rights at the date of the transfer to the average  remuneration  of  the  persons  concerned  over  the  last  three  years  in  the 2012 Plan. In the event of a transfer, the Company would be liable for a contribution in full discharge of its liabilities at a rate of 29.7% under the conditions provided for in Article 5, II of the Order of 3 July 2019. This contribution would then replace, in respect of the rights transferred, the 24% contribution based on the premiums paid to the insurer.\n\nBy decision  of  the  Board  of  Directors,  Mr.  Benoit  Bazin  continues  to  fully  benefit from the Group's health and personal risk insurance policies entered into with GAN and Mutuelle Malakoff M\u00e9d\u00e9ric respectively during his term of office.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The  compensation components  and  the  methodology  selected  are  shown below.\n\n## France scope\n\nThe France scope includes all employees  of  the consolidated subsidiaries of Saint-Gobain Group incorporated in France, on a full-time equivalent basis, and any  changes  thereto  (excluding  executive  corporate officers). Data on the median compensation of employees in the France scope are available for 2020 and 2021. The median  compensation  ratio  (France  scope)  is  therefore presented from 2020 onwards.\n\nThe  France  scope  is  homogeneous  in  terms  of  salary structure  and  the  type  of  contracts  taken  into  account, and  is  not  subject  to  exchange  rate  fluctuations,  which allows a better comparability over time. The workforce in France represented nearly 23,6% of the Group's workforce at December 31, 2023.\n\nThe  difference  between  the  ratios  on  Compagnie  de Saint -Gobain's  average  compensation  and  on  average compensation in France is mainly due to the distribution structure of the employees in the scopes concerned: thus, while  in  2023,  Compagnie  de  Saint-Gobain  comprised\n\n82,7%  managers  (including  all  members  of  the  Executive Committee of the Saint-Gobain Group except those based in a foreign country) and 17,3% administrative employees, the  France  scope  comprised  25,9%  managers,  51,7% administrative  employees,  and  22,4%  blue-collar  workers. In  addition,  the  compensation  structure  of  employees  of Compagnie  de  Saint-Gobain  generally  includes  variable compensation and performance shares.\n\n## Compensation components\n\nFor executive corporate officers: all compensation components paid or awarded during or for the fiscal year in question,  submitted  to  the  vote  of  the  General Shareholders' Meeting (ex-post Say-on-Pay) (9) , namely:\n\n- \u00b7 the  fixed  compensation  paid  during  the  given  fiscal year;\n- \u00b7 the annual variable compensation granted in respect of the same fiscal year;\n- \u00b7 any  exceptional  compensation  paid  during  the  same fiscal year;\n- \u00b7 long-term  compensation  instruments  granted  during the same fiscal year (stock options, performance shares and/or performance units) at IFRS value on the grant date;\n- \u00b7 benefits in kind (company car) granted during the same fiscal year (book value);\n\n\u00cb",

The employees who have entered into a part-time employment contract with Compagnie de Saint-Gobain or a consolidated subsidiary of the Saint-Gobain Group registered  in  France  were  not  taken  into  account  when calculating  the  ratios  but  represent  less  than  2,2%  of  the workforce for the considered scope.\n\nCompensation of the management and governing bodies\n\n## Concept of full-time equivalent\n\nTo determine the average and median compensation paid to  employees  of  Compagnie  de  Saint-Gobain  and  the consolidated  subsidiaries  of  the  Saint-Gobain  Group registered  in  France  on  a  full-time  equivalent  basis,  the methodologies already in use within the Group for social reporting  reviewed  by  the  independent  third  party  in charge  of  reviewing  non-financial  information  were  used (see section 9.2.1, p. 410).\n\n## Changes in scope\n\nWithin  the  French  scope,  the  consolidated  subsidiaries sold during a given fiscal year are excluded from the ratios calculations  of  that  fiscal  year.  The  acquired  companies which  were  in  the  process  of  being  consolidated  on December  31,  2023,  are  excluded  from  the  ratios calculations,  but  represent  less  than  3%  of  the  total number of employees of the consolidated subsidiaries of the Saint-Gobain Group registered in France.\n\n## Effect of Covid-19 on the calculation of compensation ratios in 2019 and 2020\n\nOn  the  proposition  of  the  corporate  executive  officers concerned,  the  compensation  of  executive  corporate officers for fiscal years 2019 and 2020 taken into account for the calculation of the compensation ratios for 2019 and 2020  were  impacted  by  the  reductions  of  25%  of  their fixed  compensation  for  2020  and  25%  of  their  variable compensation for 2019 (see Chapter 5, section 2.2.2 of the Company's 2020 Universal Registration Document) decided  by  the  Board  of  Directors  for  as  long  as  the Saint -Gobain  Group's  employees  were  subject  to  partial employment  in  the  context  of  the  emergency  measures taken by the French Government to halt the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nCompensation  paid  by  the  French  State  in  2020  to employees  of  Saint-Gobain  Group  entities  subject  to partial  employment  in  the  context  of  the  emergency measures  taken  by  the  French  Government  to  halt  the spread  of  the  Covid-19  pandemic  are  taken  into  account for  the  purposes  of  calculating  compensation  ratios  for 2020  as  if  that  compensation  had  been  paid  by  the Saint -Gobain Group.\n\n<!-- image -->",

It is determined and reviewed, among other things, based on the results of specific surveys from specialized consultants commissioned  by  Group's  Senior  Management.  They include, in addition to a fixed portion, a reasonable variable portion in relation to the total compensation, the purpose of  which  is  to  reflect  the  CEO's  personal  contribution  to the  results  and  development  of  the  scope,  taking  into account  three  financial  indicators:  cash  flow  generation, operating  margin  relative  to  turnover,  and  Return  on Capital Employed ('ROCE'), qualitative objectives and the results concerning occupational health and safety and CO2 emissions.\n\nThis principle is applied to the whole of middle and senior management.\n\nIn this way, management compensation is clearly linked to performance  and  to  the  achievement  of  objectives  that promotes  a  high  level  of  personal  commitment.  Each manager's  compensation  can  fluctuate  significantly  from one year to the next, based on the results achieved.\n\nTotal  gross  compensation  received  in  2023  from  the Group's French and foreign companies by members of the Executive Committee as of December 31, 2023 (excluding the executive corporate officers and excluding long-term compensation  components),  amounted  to  \u20ac15.1  million (versus  \u20ac12.9  million  in  2022),  including  \u20ac5.5  million (versus \u20ac4.4 million in 2022) in gross variable compensation  for  2023,  an  increase  compared  with  the gross variable portion of this compensation for 2022. No severance  payments  were  made  to  members  of  the Executive Committee as composed on December 31, 2023 (same as in 2022).\n\nPensions  and  other  post-employment  benefits  (DefinedBenefit  Obligations  in  respect  of  retirement  bonuses  and pensions) accruing for the members of Group Management totaled \u20ac40.5 million  at  December  31,  2023 (versus \u20ac29.2 million at December 31, 2022) (see Note 6.2 of  the  consolidated  financial  statements,  section  8.1  p. 298).\n\nCompensation  allocated  to  Directors  representing  the Group (particularly members of Group's Senior Management) in Group companies other than Compagnie de  Saint-Gobain  is  either  reverted  to  their  employer company, or paid directly to that company.\n\n## 5.2.4 LONG-TERM COMPENSATION PLANS (PERFORMANCE SHARES, STOCK OPTIONS AND PERFORMANCE UNITS)\n\n## Attribution policy\n\nThe  objective  of  the  Group's  long-term  compensation policy  is  to  retain  and  motivate  the  Group's  Senior Management,  officers  and  employees,  and  to  associate them with the Group's performance, in particular through conditional  allocations  of  performance  shares,  stock options or performance units to reflect their fulfillment of the Group's long-term strategy.\n\nAt the recommendation of the Nomination and Remuneration Committee, the Board of Directors authorizes  the  features  of  the  performance  share  and stock  option  plans,  as  well  as  the  identity  of  the beneficiaries. These  plans  are  subject  to  a  service condition  and  to  the  strict  internal  and/or  relative performance  criteria  set  by  the  Board  (see  below  for details of each allocation).\n\nIn  2023,  it  was  decided,  as  in  2022,  to  only  implement  a performance share plan. This plan applied to 2,877 of the Group's  managers  and  officers,  in  France  and  overseas: managers  with  outstanding  performance  and  highpotential managers and the main functional and operational  heads  of  the  Entities  and  Regions  (2498), executives who benefited from an exceptional grant (364) and  Executive  Committee  (15),  excluding  the  Chief Executive Officer. Grants to the Chief Executive Officer are detailed  in  the  paragraph  'Long-term  compensation policy' in section 5.2.2, p. 207.\n\nThe  beneficiaries  of  this  plan  are  of  75  different nationalities and work in 75 countries.\n\n\u00cb\n\nThe  performance  share  plan  entitles  beneficiaries  to existing  shares  and  therefore  has  no  impact  in  terms  of dilution. No stock option or performance unit plan was set up during fiscal year 2023.\n\nThe  other  instruments  designed  to  associate  employees with business results are presented in section 7.1.6, p. 285, and section 3.5.3.A, p. 134.\n\n## Performance share plans\n\nPerformance share plans have been set up by the Board of Directors every year since 2009.\n\nUnder  the  authorization  granted  by  the  eighteenth resolution of the General Shareholders' Meeting of June 2, 2022, at its meeting of November 23, 2023, the Board of Directors resolved to implement a performance share plan, following analysis and  the  recommendation  of  the Nomination and Remuneration Committee.\n\nThis plan covers 2,878 officers of the Group in France and abroad, who were granted a total of 1,268,633 performance  shares  (including  the  grant  to  the  Chief Executive Officer).\n\nIt should be noted that, as in 2022, no stock option plans or  performance  units  were  put  in  place  in  2023,  as  all beneficiaries received performance shares.",

        "page_content": "The duration of the vesting period was set at four years, with delivery of the shares to occur on the fourth day after the close of this period.\n\nThe  performance  criteria  applicable  to  the  performance share plan implemented on November 23, 2023, applicable for  both  the  Chief  Executive  Officer  and  the  Group's managers and officers, include, as has been the case since 2015, an internal performance condition linked to Saint -Gobain Group's Return on Capital Employed, including goodwill, and a performance condition linked to the performance of the Saint-Gobain stock price compared  to  the  performance  of  the  CAC  40  stock market index. Furthermore, following dialog with investors, the long-term compensation plans put in place since 2017 by  the  Board  of  Directors,  on  the  proposal  of  the Nomination and Remuneration Committee, now include a criterion relating to Corporate Social Responsibility. These criteria were deemed relevant by the Board of Directors as they  reflect  the  operational,  financial  and  non-financial performance  of  the  Saint-Gobain  Group  and  ensure  that the beneficiaries are aligned with the interests of Saint -Gobain shareholders.\n\nThe vesting of performance shares under the plan set up in  November  2023  is  therefore  subject  to  the  following conditions cumulatively:\n\n- \u00b7 service  condition:  to  be  an  employee  or  a  company Director of a Saint-Gobain Group company throughout the  entire  duration  of  the  vesting  period,  without interruption, except in a number of specific cases such as  death,  disability  (as  defined  in  paragraphs  (2)  and\n\nCompensation of the management and governing bodies\n\n(3)  of  Article  L.  341-4  of  the  French  Social  Security Code),  no-fault  termination,  negotiated  departure, retirement,  transfer  to  another  position  within  the Group,  or  change  of  control  of  the  grantee's  host company to outside the Group;\n\n- \u00b7 performance  condition  linked  to  the  following  three criteria:\n- -60%  of  the  shares  initially  allocated  are  subject  to the criteria of Return on Capital Employed, including goodwill, of the Saint-Gobain Group (ROCE);\n- -20% of the shares initially allocated are subject to a criterion linked to the performance of the Saint -Gobain stock price versus the performance of the CAC 40 stock market index; and\n- -20% of the shares initially allocated are subject to a criterion  linked  to  Corporate  Social  Responsibility. This  criterion,  resulting  from  dialog  with  investors, comprises the following three indicators, all quantifiable  and  published  each  year  as  key  CSR indicators:  the  rate  of  reduction  of  CO2  emissions (10%  of  the  shares  initially  allocated),  the  total recordable accident rate - more than 24 hours' lost and non-lost time (TRAR), and the senior executives diversity index (5% of the shares initially allocated to each of them).\n\nHowever, the first 100 shares granted to each beneficiary other than Executive Committee members will be exempt from the performance conditions.\n\nROCE performance will be calculated as follows:\n\n| Arithmetic mean of the ROCE for the years 2024, 2025 and 2026   | Percentage of shares initially granted, contingent upon the ROCE  (i.e. 60% of grant), vested   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Greater than 13.5%                                              | All                                                                                             |\n| Between 12% and 13.5%                                           | 50% + 50%*[(Arithmetic mean of ROCE for 2024, 2025 and 2026 - 12%)/ (13.5% - 12%)]              |\n| Equal to 12%                                                    | 50%                                                                                             |\n| Between 11% and 12%                                             | 50%*[(Arithmetic mean of ROCE for 2024, 2025 and 2026 - 11%)/(12% - 11%)]                       |\n| 11% or less                                                     | None                                                                                            |\n\nThese  criteria  are  the  same  since  2021,  the  Board  of Directors considering that, despite the Group's performances,  particularly  in  view  of  the  high  level  of geopolitical  uncertainty  and  the  sharp  downturn  in  the global  economy,  he  did  not  want  to  increase  them.  But given the Group's performances, it did not wish to reduce them  either.  As  a  reminder,  the  reasoning  behind  the criteria  to  calculate  performance  is  based,  for  the  ROCE, on the objective announced at the Capital Markets Day on October 6, 2021, of an average annual ROCE of between 12%  and  15%  for  the  period  2021-2025.  Even  though  the announced  objective  is  reached  from  12%,  an  ambitious\n\ncriterion  has  been  set  (13.5%)  for  100%  of  the  shares initially  allocated to vest. If the arithmetic mean of ROCE for  2023,  2024  and  2025  is  equal  to  12%,  i.e.,  if  the objective  is  reached  within  the  range  of  12%  to  15% announced at the Capital Markets Day, it was decided to allocate  only  50%  at  this  level,  with  a  linear  progression between 11% and 12% and then between 12% and 13.5%. The 2021 plan criteria reflect the Group's  performance conditions, which will only definitively allocate 50% of the shares with an ROCE of 12% and therefore if the target is reached.\n\n<!-- image -->",

It is therefore exposed  to  risks,  the occurrence of which could have a material adverse effect on  its  businesses,  financial  position,  results  and  outlook. This  chapter  presents  the  main  risks  to  which  the  Group believes  it  is  exposed  at  the  date  of  this  Universal Registration Document.\n\nDue  to  the  Group's  multiple  geographic  locations,  the diversity of its markets and product ranges, as well as its development,  the  Saint -Gobain  Group  is  exposed  to different  categories  of  risks.  In  the  framework  of  the provisions of Article 16 of Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 of the European  Parliament  and  of  the  Council,  the  risk  factors considered most important (identified with an asterisk), at\n\nthe  date  of  this  Universal  Registration  Document,  are mentioned  in  the  first  place  within  each  of  the  risk categories mentioned below, in line with an evaluation that takes account  of  their impact  and  probability of occurrence.  Saint -Gobain's  evaluation  of  the  significance of  the  risks  may  be  modified  at  any  time,  particularly  if new internal or external events occur.\n\nThe reader's attention is drawn to the fact that other risks of  which  the  Group  is  not  aware  at  the  date  of  this Universal  Registration  Document,  or  the  occurrence  of which is not currently considered likely to have a material adverse  effect  on  the  Group,  its  businesses,  financial position, results and outlook, may or might exist or arise.\n\n## 6.1.1 RISKS SPECIFIC TO THE GROUP AND ITS BUSINESS SECTOR\n\n## Risks related to the economic situation*\n\nA  significant  part  of  the  Group's  activities  is  linked  to investment in the construction sector, namely the following markets:  and  infrastructure  (50%  % (1) of  2023  revenue), new residential construction (23% (1) of 2023 revenue) and non-residential  construction  (13% (1) of  2023  revenue), which are sensitive  to  economic  conditions,  including  the consequences of the inflation over the past two years and the  rise  in  interest  rates  in  the  Group's  main  countries. Consequently,  the  Group's  results  are  sensitive  to  the macroeconomic conditions of the geographic regions, both at  regional  and  local  levels,  where  the  Group  is  active. Since the Group is established in 75 countries around the world  (particularly  in  Northern  Europe,  Southern  Europe, the Middle East, Sub-Saharan Africa, North America, Latin America  and  Asia-Pacific),  a  deterioration  in  the  global economic  environment  due,  for  example,  to  a  severe economic downturn or a major recession in any of these geographic regions is likely to have a negative impact on the  consumption  of  the  Group's  products  in  the  regions concerned, which could have a material adverse effect on the  Group's  revenues,  results,  free  cash  flow  generation and outlook (see section 2.2.2 p. 73).\n\n## Risks related to the Group's international activities*\n\nThe Group is active worldwide, including outside Western Europe  and  North  America.  It  is  present  in  particular  in Eastern  Europe,  the  Middle  East,  Africa,  Asia-Pacific,  and Latin America, particularly in Brazil. Approximately 24% of the Group's consolidated revenue was generated in these regions in 2023. Generally speaking, the Group's activities in  these  regions  carry  higher  risks  than  in  Western European  and  North  American  countries,  due  to  the existence  of  greater  economic  and  political  instability,  as well  as  greater  exposure  to  social  and  infrastructure disruptions than in more mature markets.\n\n(1)\n\n\u00cb\n\nThus,  the  direct  and  indirect  consequences  of  political instability  or  of  an  unstable  economic  or  regulatory environment in which the Group operates, in a country in which the Group is active or markets its products, could have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  investments  in  those countries'  construction  sector,  and  consequently  on  the Group's businesses, financial position, results or outlook.\n\nIn this respect, the war between Russia and Ukraine, which is  a  factor  of  economic  uncertainty  affecting  economic activity and world trade, could have an adverse impact on the Group's activities even though the Group's economic exposure to Russia is not significant (approximately 0.7% of the  Group's  consolidated  turnover  in  2023  and approximately 2,000 employees, some 1,350 of whom are spread over the Group's nine factories). Similarly, the war in  the  Middle  East  is  likely  to  affect  the  Group:  even though its activities in the region are modest and it has no presence  in  Israel,  the  conflict  is  likely  to  destabilize  the prices of certain raw materials on world markets such as oil  or  disrupt  the  freight  transport  flows,  which  could indirectly affect the Group's activities.\n\nThe Covid-19 pandemic has clearly abated, but a potential resurgence  of  the  epidemic  could  lead  to  further restrictive  measures  that  could  affect  supply  chains  and the  economy  more  generally.  The  Group  is  partly protected  from  this  risk  by  the  highly  local  nature  of  its sourcing and its production and sales activities.,\n\nMoreover,  legal  or  regulatory  changes  applicable  to  the Group's activities (involving, among other things, taxation, restrictions on capital transfers, customs duties, intellectual  property  and  import  and  export  licenses,  the employment system or health, safety or the environment) could  significantly  increase  the  Group's  costs  in  the various countries in which it is active, or limit its ability to freely transfer its capital, and consequently have a material adverse effect on its businesses, financial position, results and outlook.",

        "page_content": "Lastly,  the  Group  operates  in  an  uncertain  geopolitical climate where trade tensions such as those that may arise from  the  war  between  Russia  and  Ukraine  or  those between  China  and  the  United  States,  are  becoming increasingly prominent. The Group mainly operates in local markets (see section 2.2.1.A,  p.  69),  although  some  of  its manufacturing  activities  have  global  value  chains  and could  be  subject  to  political  and  trade  tensions,  such  as the  automotive  industry.  Further  deterioration  of  global trade relations could therefore have an adverse effect on the Group's results and outlook in these business sectors. At  the  date  of  this  Universal  Registration  Document,  the war  between  Russia  and  Ukraine  has  had  no  material adverse effect on the value chains of the Group's activities.\n\n## Risks related to innovation and the digital revolution\n\nThe  Group  has  placed  innovation  at  the  heart  of  its strategy  (see  section  1.4.3,  p.  39)  in  order  to  feed  its competitiveness  and  maintain  a  high  level  of  operational excellence and financial and non-financial performance.\n\nCertain  markets  in  which  the  Group  is  positioned  are evolving  rapidly,  with  the  appearance  of  new  practices, products  and  solutions  (for  instance  prefabrication,  3D printing,  light  construction,  digital  services  linked  to  the various phases of construction projects, optimized logistics and management of circularity), new technologies and new communication and distribution channels relying on digital tools and content (see section 1.4.2, p. 38) The success  of  the  Group  depends  on  its  capacity  to  keep pace with these changes at all times and integrate these new  technologies  into  its  product  offerings,  in  order  to respond effectively to clients' needs.\n\nFollowing  the  success,  one  year  in  advance,  of  the 'Transform  &  Grow'  program  set  up  in  November  2018, one of the challenges of which, in terms of innovation and digital  transformation,  was  to  optimally  reconcile,  on  the one hand, initiatives and coordination of marketing policies and  strategic  innovations  on  a  global  scale,  and,  on  the other  hand,  necessary  local  adaptations  or  initiatives  to meet the  needs  of  local  markets  and  clients  in  the  most pertinent  and  efficient  way  possible  (in  particular  sales channels, logistics offering, etc.), the new 'Grow & Impact' strategic plan announced to investors on October 6, 2021, continues  to  pursue  these  objectives  and  significantly strengthens the ambitions regarding the digital transformation in terms of both organization and resources. The Group's Digital & IT and Innovation entities are  pooling  resources  to  explore  the  potential  and  the possible  scaling-up  of  the  new  digital  technologies.  The Group  might  not  be  in  a  position  to  fully  implement  its digital strategy, which could adversely affect its revenues, results or outlook.\n\nThe  Group's  innovation  policy  notably  also  comprises  an ambitious  marketing  approach  which  seeks  to  better understand, anticipate and respond to client requirements, working  where  appropriate  closely  with  Research  and Development to supply customized solutions. This policy of  marketing  innovation  and  operational  excellence  is based in particular on specific strategic watches. Innovation  involving  research  and  development  requires\n\nRisk factors\n\nmaterial investments \u20ac(493 million at December 31, 2023, i.e.,  28  %  of  the  Group's  total  investments)  as  well  as  an appropriate recruitment and training policy, particularly in the  new  business  lines  resulting  from  the  digital  boom (digital marketing, business lines linked to the use of data, artificial intelligence, the development of digital platforms, and Industry 4.0 for example, see section 1.4.2, p. 38), the expected benefits of which cannot be guaranteed.\n\nThe Group's revenue, operating margins and results could be  affected  if  it  fails  to  invest  or  invests  insufficiently  in appropriate technologies related to the digital transformation,  or  if  is  unable  rapidly  to  bring  new products to market, or if seeks to market products that do not  adequately  address  client  needs  or  if  competing products are quickly introduced.\n\n## Intellectual property risks\n\nThe  growth  in  the  Group's  activities  relies  on  the protection  of  its  manufacturing  secrets,  patents  (more than 450 patents registered in 2023), brands and models, and other intellectual property rights (for a description of the  Group's  portfolio  of  patents  and  brands,  see  section 2.2.2 A, p. 73 and 2.2.2 B p. 75). If the Group were to be unable  to  obtain,  protect  and  preserve  its  intellectual property rights, or its freedom to exploit them, this could result in the loss of its exclusive rights to use technologies and processes, which could have a material adverse effect on its results.\n\nThe  Group  has  an  active  policy  for  the  protection  of  its intellectual property rights but cannot rule out the risk of its products being counterfeited, the appropriation or illicit use  of  its  intellectual  property  rights  or  an  unfavorable ruling by the courts.\n\nThe Group may be forced to take legal action against third parties  suspected  of  breaching  its  rights.  Any  such proceedings may give rise to significant costs and hamper growth  in  sales  of  the  products  manufactured  using  the rights  concerned  or  force  the  Group  to  incur  additional expenses  to  develop  other  technologies  that  do  not  use the disputed technology.\n\n## Risks related to the supply of energy and raw materials and changes in the cost of energy and raw materials\n\nThe Group's industrial  activities,  some  of  which  consume high  levels  of  energy,  such  as  Building  and  Automobile Glass, Insulation or Gypsum (see section 2.2.2 B, p. 75 for a description  of  these  activities),  or  are  dependent  on certain  raw  materials,  could  be  impacted  by  a  significant increase in prices resulting from difficulties in sourcing raw materials and/or energy (e.g., natural gas or electricity), or by  the  occurrence  of  natural  disasters,  extreme  weather conditions, or geopolitical circumstances such as the war between  Russia  and  Ukraine.  By  way  of  illustration,  at December  31,  2023,  the  Group's  irrevocable  purchase commitments  relating  to  raw  materials  and  energy represented \u20ac2.2 billion (see Note 5.5.1 to the consolidated financial statements, section 8.1, p. 321).\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\nRisk factors\n\nThe Group's ability to pass on these cost increases to its clients depends to a large extent on market conditions and commercial practices. Even if the Group passes them on, it may do so only in part and/or with a slippage over time. The Group's inability to immediately and/or fully pass on increases in the cost of raw materials and/or energy in the short  term  could  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  its operations, financial position or results.\n\nThe Group has set up hedging arrangements for some of the  risks  associated  with  the  cost  of  energy  and/or  raw materials (see Note 10.1 Financial Risks to the consolidated financial  statements,  section  8.1,  p.  343).  Nevertheless,  it cannot  guarantee  that  these  hedges,  which  themselves represent  a  cost  for  the  Group,  will  fully  cover  any additional  costs  incurred  as  a  result  of  future  price increases in the cost of energy and/or raw materials; they will  depend  on  the  underlying  assumptions  regarding movements in costs applied by the Group.\n\n## Industrial and environmental risks\n\nThe  Group  could  incur  significant  expenses  and  be exposed  to  environmental  liabilities  as  a  result  of  its operation  of  past,  present  or  future  industrial  sites  (see Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements, section 8.1, p. 339).\n\nThe  industrial  and  environmental  risks  arising  from  the operation of some sites primarily relate to the storage of certain hazardous substances.\n\nAt  December  31,  2023,  seven  sites  were  classified  under Directive  2012/18/EU  on  the  control  of  major-accident hazards  involving  dangerous  substances,  known  as  the 'Seveso III' Directive. These industrial sites are subject to specific regulations and close supervision by the competent  authorities  and  the  Group's  Environment, Health and Safety Department.\n\nThese  sites  include  Balsta  (Gypsum)  in  Sweden,  storing liquid  natural  gas,  Etolikon  (Gypsum)  in  Greece  and Stjordal (Insulation) in Norway, storing liquefied petroleum gas,  Billesholm  (Insulation)  in  Sweden  and  Sully-sur-Loire (Sekurit-Transport) and Sermaises (HPS) in France, storing combustive  liquids,  which  fall  under  the  'lower-tier' defined  by  the  'Seveso  III'  Directive.  Two  other  facilities are classified as 'upper-tier': the Bagneaux-sur-Loing site (Flat  Glass)  in  France,  which  stores  arsenic  (AS203)  and the  Carrascal  del  Rio  site  (Flat  Glass)  in  Spain,  which stores hydrofluoric acid (HF).\n\nAfter identifying accident risks and their potential impact on the environment, preventive measures were implemented  at  these  facilities,  covering  the  design  and construction  of  storage  areas,  as  well  as  the  manner  in which they are operated and maintained. Internal contingency  plans  have  been  developed  to  respond  to incidents.  The  financial  consequences  of  personal  injury and damage to property that may arise by accident from plant  operations  are  covered  by  the  current  Group  civil liability  and  environment  impairment  liability  insurance programs (for a description of these programs, see section 6.1.5,  p.  259),  except  for  the  Bagneaux-sur-Loing  plant, which is operated by a joint venture and which is insured under a specific policy subscribed by this subsidiary. In the event of an industrial accident, compensation payments to victims  would  be  organized  jointly  by  the  company,  the insurance broker and the insurer.\n\n\u00cb\n\nThe Saint -Gobain Group is also exposed to risks of chronic pollution,  and  could  therefore  be  required  to  incur expenses  to  restore  active  or  closed  industrial  sites  or clean  up  the  environment.  At  December  31,  2023,  63 European Group sites are classified as 'IED' installations in the meaning  of  Directive  2010/75/EU  on  industrial emissions, and  are subject to integrated pollution prevention and control regulations.\n\nA breach of these regulations could result in fines or other civil,  administrative  or  criminal  penalties,  specifically  the withdrawal  of  permits  and  licenses  needed  for  the activities  in  question  to  continue  operation,  which  could have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  the  Group's  revenue, results, free cash flow generation and outlook.\n\nLastly,  changes  in  environmental  regulations,  including their  interpretation,  and  consideration  of  climate  change risks  (see  section  3.3,  p.  106)  could  cause  the  Group  to incur significant expenses and/or investments.\n\n## Risks related to external growth\n\nThe Group's strategy is based, in part, on external growth, in  particular  by  acquiring  businesses  or  assets,  taking equity  interests  or  establishing  joint  ventures  in  the Group's  business  lines  and  in  geographic  regions  where the  Group  seeks  to  establish  or  strengthen  itself  (see section 1.4.5, p. 41). For example For example, on June 12, 2023,  the  Group  announced  that  it  had  entered  into  a definitive agreement  for  the  acquisition  of  Building Products  of  Canada  Corp.a  manufacturer  of  residential roofing  shingles  and  wood  fiber  insulation  panels  in Canada\n\nHowever, the Group may not be in a position to identify attractive  targets  or  to  enter  into  transactions  at  the optimal  time  and/or  under  satisfactory  conditions  (see paragraph B of section 1.4.5, p. 41, for a description of the business  portfolio  management  strategy).  The  expected benefits  of  these  external  growth  operations  depend,  in part, on  the  realization  of  expected  synergies  and integration of the activities of the acquired companies, and on  relationships  with  other  participants  in  the  joint ventures.  The  Group  gives  no  guarantees  as  to  these objectives,  which,  if  not  fulfilled  within  the  expected timeframes  and  at  the  expected  levels,  could  affect  the Group's financial position, results and outlook.\n\n## Risks related to information systems\n\nDaily management of the Group's activities, specifically the conduct  of  its  commercial,  industrial, logistics and accounting  processes,  particularly  in  its  Distribution activities,  requires  the  proper  functioning  of  all  technical infrastructure  and  computer  applications.  The  risk  of system malfunction or interruption, which may be external or internal in origin (computer viruses or hacking, service provider default, blackouts or network shutdowns, natural disasters,  human  error,  etc.),  cannot  be  ruled  out.  In particular, a cyber attack could affect not only operations, but also the protection of confidential information or lead to the theft, loss or exposure of personal data.",

        "page_content": "It  should  be  recalled  that,  in  June  2017,  the  Group,  along with  numerous  other  companies  and  organizations  in France and abroad, was affected by the NotPetya cyberattack,  which  required  IT  systems  to  be  disconnected  in order  to  prevent  the  spread  of  the  virus,  as  well  as  the introduction of alternative processes  in  all of the Saint -Gobain  business  lines.  The  impact  of  the  cyberattack  on  operating  income  for  the  2017  fiscal  year  was calculated  to  be  \u20ac80  million.  All  of  the  information systems  were  back  up  and  running  within  ten  days, without any data being lost or compromised.\n\nWith a view to learning from NotPetya and minimizing the probability and the impact of this type of malfunction, the Cybersecurity Department of the Group, as part of a cyberdefense  plan,  has  introduced  strict  rules  relating  to  the governance  and  security  of  information  systems,  both  in terms  of  infrastructure  and  applications,  data  protection and  business  continuity  plans.  This  plan  was  deployed  at Group  level,  controlled  by  the  Audit  and  Internal  Control Department and by regular external audits (see section 5.1.2,  p.  191,  on  the  work  of  the  Board  of  Directors and the Audit and Risk Committee). Since 2021, the cyberdefense  plan  has  become  the  cybersecurity  continuous improvement plan, and an external audit is carried out on behalf  of  the  Audit  and  Risk  Committee  every  two  years. Furthermore,  a  new  insurance  program  covering  the Group's cyber risks has been in place and renewed annually since the end of 2017. The implementation of these various actions has made  it possible to ensure that the cybersecurity incidents and cyberattacks that Saint -Gobain Group has had to deal with over the past three years have had no consequences for the Group's operations.\n\nThe occurrence of such malfunctions may adversely affect the  Group's  operations,  the  protection  of  its  know-how and its financial results.\n\n## 6.1.2 GROUP STRUCTURAL RISKS\n\n## Risks linked to the Group's pension and similar commitments*\n\nThe  Group  recognizes  significant  pension  and  similar obligations  mainly  in  Western  Europe  (in  particular  in France,  Germany  and  the  United  Kingdom)  and  in  North America (United States and Canada), in respect of pension plans  that  for  the  most  part  are  no  longer  open  to  new employees.  At  December  31,  2023,  the  total  amount  of pension plan commitments was \u20ac9.2 billion (see Note 6.3 to the consolidated financial statements, section 8.1, p. 322).\n\nThe level of provision for Group pension plans (\u20ac2 billion at  December  31,  2023)  may  be  affected  by  adverse changes in the actuarial assumptions used to calculate the projected  plan  liabilities,  by  a  reduction  in  the  discount rates  used  to  measure  future  commitments,  a  change  in the assumed mortality rates or an increase in the inflation rates  used,  or  a  fall  in  the  market  values  of  plan  assets, consisting mainly of equities and bonds.\n\nRisk factors\n\n## Risks related to climate change and the energy transition\n\nThe  fight  against  climate  change  involves  both  risk management and the development of the Group's markets (see section 3.3.1, p. 106).\n\nThe Group has placed the fight against climate change at the  heart  of  its  strategy  and  aims  to  contribute  to  a  fair and sustainable transition to a low-carbon economy with the adoption of a 2030 roadmap with a view to attaining its  goal of contribution to carbon neutrality by 2050 and the  implementation  of  the  'Sustainable  Solutions  for Growth' program.\n\nAchieving  its  climate  objectives  requires,  among  other things,  the  Group's  ability  to  access  sufficient  renewable energy  sources  to  meet  its  needs  at  satisfactory  pricing conditions.  The  Group's  failure  to  access  such  energy sources  could  have  an  adverse  effect  on  its  ability  to implement  its  strategy  and  meet  the  expectations  of  its clients and investors.\n\nIn  addition,  the  need  for  decarbonization  of  the  Group's industrial  clients  requires  an  acceleration  of  innovation  in decarbonization technologies for the construction industry, green mobility and in specialty materials for the decarbonization of industrial processes. The implementation of new industrial processes and procedures as part of the Group's sustainability roadmap represents a major technical and technological challenge. The  Group's  failure  to  deploy  these  new  processes  or procedures, or a delay in deploying them, could adversely affect  its  ability  to  implement  its  strategy  and  meet  the expectations of its clients and investors.\n\n## Risks linked to cost reduction and restructuring\n\nThe  Group  constantly  strives  to  reduce  or  optimize  its costs.  While  further  savings  are  planned,  there  is  no guarantee that the forecast reductions will be achieved or that  the  costs  related  to  possible  restructuring  will  not exceed  forecasts.  In  particular, certain restructuring operations  and  other  initiatives  may  cost  more  than expected, or the cost savings may be less than expected or  take  longer  than  expected  to  achieve.  An  increase  in restructuring costs and/or the Group's inability to achieve the expected savings could have a material adverse effect on the Group's results and outlook.\n\n<!-- image -->",

In line with Group accounting policies, goodwill and certain other intangible assets with indefinite use lives are tested  for  impairment  periodically  and  whenever  there  is an indication that their carrying amount may not be fully\n\n## 6.1.3 FINANCIAL RISKS\n\nThe  Group  is  exposed  to  financial  risks,  and  notably  a liquidity risk on  financing.  In  particular,  in  a  crisis environment,  the  Group  might  be  unable  to  raise  the financing  or  refinancing  needed  to  cover  its  investment plans  on  the  credit  or  capital  markets,  or  to  obtain  such\n\nfinancing  or  refinancing  on  acceptable  terms.  For  more information  on  this  liquidity  risk  and  the  other  financial risks to which the Group is exposed, please see Note 10.1 to the consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, section 8.1, p. 329.\n\n## 6.1.4 LEGAL RISKS\n\n## Risks linked to legal and administrative procedures\n\nThe Group is exposed to risks of investigations, litigations and  claims  arising  in  the  normal  course  of  business.  The most significant disputes pending or for which the Group has  received  notifications  are  described  below.  These proceedings  may  result  in  a  conviction,  the  payment  of substantial damages, regulatory or even criminal sanctions,  and  may  tarnish  the  Group's  reputation  and thus  have  a  significant  negative  impact  on  the  Group's image, financial position and  operating  results. At December  31,  2023,  total  provisions  for  Group  litigation amounted  to  275  millions  d'euros  (cf.  note  9  to  the consolidated financial statements , section 8.1, p. 329).\n\n## Competition law and related proceedings*\n\nCompetition  laws  apply  to  the  Group  companies  in countries in which it operates. Violation of competition law exposes  the  Group  to  fines  and,  in  certain  countries, potential  criminal  sanctions  on  the  Group  and  the employees involved. Any litigation filed by a competition authority could, in the event of conviction, give rise to the payment of fines and potentially damages, which is likely to  have  a  significant  impact  on  the  Group's  reputation, financial  situation  and  operating  results.The  Saint -Gobain Group is firmly committed to opposing any practice that might violate competition rules and has long applied the principle of zero tolerance. A competition law compliance program has  been  in  place  within  the  Group  since  2007 (cf. section 2.3.1 p.78 ).\n\n\u00cb\n\n## Investigation by the Swiss Competition Commission in the sanitary products wholesale industry\n\nIn  November  2011,  the  Swiss  Competition  Commission ( Commission  suisse  de  la  concurrence ) opened  an investigation into anti-competitive practices in the sanitary products wholesale industry. In May 2014, the Commission Secretariat  issued  a  notice  of  complaints  against  Sanitas Troesch and other wholesalers in the industry alleging that Sanitas Troesch and some of its competitors had, among other  things,  agreed  in  2005  and  2012  to  lower  gross prices.\n\nThe total  fine  imposed  on  all  companies  involved  is  CHF 80 million. For Sanitas Troesch, the fine is CHF 28.8 million. Sanitas Troesch appealed this decision on May 2, 2016 and continues  to  firmly  refute  the  claims  made.  The  hearing took  place  before  the  Federal  Administrative  Court  on January  21,  2020  and  the  date  on  which  the  Federal Administrative  Court  will  issue  its  decision  is  not  yet known. However, a provision for claims and litigation was recognized at December 31, 2015 in an amount equivalent to the fine (unchanged as at December 31, 2023).\n\n## Investigations by Competition Authorities in the additives and admixtures sector\n\nThe European Commission, the Competition and Markets Authority in the UK and the Turkish competition authority have launched investigations into anti-competitive practices in relation to the supply of chemical additives for cement and chemical admixtures for concrete and mortar. As of 31 December 2023, no statement of objections has been issued.\n\nIncidentally, class actions have been instituted against the Group in the United States and Canada in connection with these investigations which remain at a preliminary stage.\n\nrecoverable.  Goodwill  and  other  identified  intangible assets  may  become  impaired  as  a  result  of  worse-thanexpected Group performance, unfavorable market conditions,  unfavorable  legal  or  regulatory  changes  or many other factors. The recognition of impairment losses on goodwill could have an adverse effect on consolidated net income.\n\nProperty,  plant  and  equipment  including  rights  of  use under  leases  (\u20ac15.6  billion  at  December  31,  2023),  could also  be  subject  to  impairment  in  the  event  of  adverse changes  in  the  business  (see  note  7  to  the  consolidated financial statements, section 8.1, p. 329).",

The matter remains pending. The purpose of the filing is to achieve a certain,  final  and  equitable  resolution  of  all  current  and future  claims  arising  from  asbestos-containing  products manufactured  and  sold  by  the  former  CertainTeed Corporation.\n\nDBMP LLC intends to seek court authority to establish a trust under section 524(g) of the US Bankruptcy Code - a specific provision that is applicable to companies that face substantial  numbers  of  asbestos-related  claims  -  to achieve  a  fair  and  equitable  resolution  of  its  asbestosrelated liabilities. Upon establishment of the trust, current and future plaintiffs with qualifying claims will be able to receive  faster  payment  of  their  claims  without  the  delay, stress  and  uncertainty  of  litigation  in  the  tort  system;  at the same time, the creation and funding of such a trust will permanently  and  finally  resolve  DBMP  LLC's  asbestos liability.\n\nDuring  the  course  of  this  bankruptcy  process,  which  is expected to take up to approximately five to eight years, all  asbestos  litigations  have  been  stayed  and  all  related costs suspended, providing DBMP LLC with the time and protection to negotiate an agreement to be approved on behalf of all claimants and by the court.\n\nThis  action  was  taken  as  a  result  of  the  increasing  risks presented in  the  US  tort  system.  Despite  the  passage  of time, the aging of the population and lessening opportunity  for  claimants  to  assert  legitimate  claims  of exposure  to  the  asbestos-containing  products  of  the former  CertainTeed  Corporation,  naming  practices  in  the tort  system  continued  to  result  in  a  steady  volume  of claims against DBMP LLC, with no foreseeable end in sight. In  addition,  there  has  been,  in  general,  an  escalation  of settlement demands and verdicts in the tort system.\n\nCertain adversary  proceedings  have  been  filed  by representatives  of  current  and  future  asbestos  plaintiffs against DBMP  LLC,  CertainTeed  LLC,  Saint -Gobain Corporation,  Compagnie  de  Saint -Gobain  and  various other  parties.  No  decisions  on  the  merits  of  the  claims have  been  made  and  such  claims  do  not  affect  the Company's financial assessment of the Chapter 11 case.\n\n## Impact on the financial statements\n\nFollowing  the  commencement  of  the  proceeding  under Chapter  11  of  the  US  Bankruptcy  Code  on  January  23, 2020,  the  assets  and  liabilities  of  DBMP  LLC  and  its wholly-owned  subsidiary  Millwork  &  Panel  LLC,  and  in particular  the  provision  for  asbestos-related  litigation  in the  United  States,  are  no  longer  consolidated  in  the Group's financial statements.\n\nNonetheless,  because  of  a  funding  agreement  between CertainTeed  LLC  and  DBMP  LLC  by  which  CertainTeed LLC has agreed to fund the costs of the Chapter 11 case and, ultimately, the 524(g) trust, in both cases solely to the extent  DBMP  LLC  is  unable  to  do  so  in  full,  the  Group recorded  in  its  consolidated  financial  statements  a provision  corresponding  to  the  amount  of  the  estimated debt against DBMP LLC amounting to $407 million as of December 31, 2023 ($410 million as of December 31, 2022).\n\n<!-- image -->",

Around 1,200 contractual instruments have accordingly been signed to date.\n\nTwo class actions were initiated against Brasilit in 2017 by two associations defending former employees exposed to asbestos at the S\u00e3o Caetano (S\u00e3o Paulo state) and Recife (Pernambuco  state)  plants,  asking  for  their  medical assistance  and  compensation  to  be  revised.  First  and second  instance  decisions  were  rendered  in  connection with the suit related to the S\u00e3o Caetano plant respectively in  July  2020  and  July  2021,  rejecting  the  claims  of  the plaintiffs. The  latter  have  nevertheless  appealed  the second  instance  decision.  First  and  second  instance decisions  were  rendered  in  relation  to  Recife  case, respectively  in  February  and  October  2022  rejecting  the claiming party arguments. The plaintiff has appealed such second instance decision.\n\nA third class action was initiated against Brasilit in 2019 in Capivari  (State  of  S\u00e3o  Paulo)  by  the  Labor  prosecutor asking  for  health  insurance,  as  well  as  collective  moral damages,  in  favor  of  employees,  former  employees  and their  respective  families,  as  well  as  subcontractors  who were  exposed  to  asbestos.  First  and  second  instance decisions were rendered respectively in September 2020 and May 2023 partly in favor of the plaintiffs. In particular, collective  moral  damages  were  granted  to  the  plaintiffs, for  an  amount  reduced  to  BRL  5  million  (\u20ac0.8  million). Brasilit has appealed the second instance decision.\n\nBrasilit is subject to controls by the Ministry of Labor and continues  to  comply  with  all  of  its  legal  obligations  with regard  to  medical  assistance  for  its  current  and  former employees.\n\nIn November 2017, the Supreme Court of Brazil decided to ban  asbestos  definitively  across  the  country.  Brasilit stopped using asbestos voluntarily as early as 2002.\n\n## Environmental disputes\n\n## PFOA proceedings in the United States\n\nLevels  of  PFOA  (perfluorooctanoic  acid)  in  excess  of  US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) health advisories or  state  maximum  contaminant  levels  for  drinking  water have been found in municipal water systems and private wells near current Saint -Gobain Performance Plastics (SG PPL) facilities in Hoosick Falls (New York) and Merrimack (New  Hampshire),  and  two  former  facilities  in  North Bennington  (Vermont)  in  the  United  States.  PFOA  and PTFE (polytetrafluorethylene) have never been manufactured  by  these  plants.  SG  PPL  is  a  processor  of PTFE  which  it  purchases  from  third  party  suppliers  and which in the past contained some PFOA.\n\n\u00cb\n\nSG PPL has voluntarily provided bottled water in all three communities, installed point-of-entry treatment systems to residents and businesses in all three communities, installed carbon filtration systems on the municipal water supply in Hoosick  Falls  and  funded  the  installation  of  a  carbon filtration system  on  the  Merrimack  Valley  District's municipal  water  supply.  In  addition,  it  has  voluntarily funded  construction  of  water  line  extensions  in  certain communities in the Merrimack and Bennington areas. The investigations are on-going and the scope of responsibility for SG PPL arising from environmental remediation in New Hampshire  and  New  York  and  clean-up  obligations  at these sites has not yet been established. The scope of the remediation in Vermont is defined and largely completed; future  operation  and  maintenance  obligations  remain. Without  admitting  liability,  SG  PPL  has  signed  consent orders  with  the  environmental  regulators  in  New  York  in 2016 and 2023 in Vermont in 2017 and 2019 with respect to  two  different  areas,  and  in  New  Hampshire  in  2018, pursuant  to  which  SG  PPL  has  agreed  to  complete investigations,  implement  interim  or  final  remediation measures  at  its  current  and  former  facilities  and  in  the case of Vermont and New Hampshire, fund construction of water lines. Responsibility, if any, is expected to be shared with other parties as regards in particular the Hoosick Falls site.\n\nPFOA-related  lawsuits  alleging  both  health-related  and economic damages claims have been filed in civil courts in New York, New Hampshire and Vermont, some of which are in the form of class actions. It is difficult to predict the timing or outcome of any such litigation, or whether any additional  litigation  will  be  brought  against  SG  PPL, however,  both  the  New  York  and  Vermont  class  actions are settled.\n\nOn  December  31,  2023,  the  provision  recorded  by  the Company  in  respect  of  this  matter  amounts  to  \u20ac226 million  (compared  to  \u20ac201  million  as  of  December  31, 2012). This provision covers  both  remediation  and litigation related to PFOA matters.\n\n## Other contingent liabilities\n\n## Grenfell Tower fire in the United Kingdom\n\nCelotex - whose control was transferred by Saint-Gobain Construction  Products  UK  on  January  5,  2024,  provides insulation  materials  for  specific  applications  for  the building  and  construction  industry.  Insulation  materials from two Celotex ranges were purchased via distributors and  used  in  refurbishing  Grenfell  Tower,  London  in 2015/2016, including as one component of the rainscreen cladding system designed and installed (by third parties) on the tower's external facade.\n\nFollowing the Grenfell Tower fire on June 14, 2017, a Public Inquiry  was  constituted  to  consider,  among  other  things, the  modifications  made  to  the  building  as  part  of  the refurbishment, the role played by the various construction professionals,  and  the  information  provided  by  the manufacturers  of  the  products  used.  The  Inquiry's  work was  divided  into  two  phases.  Its  phase  1  report  was published  on  October  30,  2019.  Phase  2  commenced  in January  2020  and  public  hearings  are  complete.  A  final report  is  expected  to  follow  later  this  year.  A  criminal investigation  into  the  circumstances  of  the  fire  is  also  in progress.",

Celotex Limited  is  continuing  to  engage  with  a  number  of  other defendants in an alternative dispute resolution process to seek  to  resolve  the  remaining  claims  brought  by  the emergency responders. The principal financial implications from the concluded settlements have been paid in full and are reflected in the financial statements as of 31 December 2023.\n\nThe  extent  to  which  Celotex  Limited  and  Saint -Gobain Construction  Products  UK  Limited  may  incur  further financial expenditure  or  civil  or  criminal  liability  in connection with the production, marketing, supply or use of their products is currently unclear and these companies are  currently  unable  to  make  a  reliable  estimate  of  their potential liability in this respect.\n\n## Other proceedings and disputes\n\nSome of the Group's companies may also be the subject of other  claims  made  by  their  employees  or  by  the  tax authorities, or in the context of the enforcement of seller's warranties granted by the Group to the buyers of divested businesses (see . in the consolidated financial statements p.  321,  note  5.5.2).  Apart  from  the  proceedings  and litigation  described  above,  to  the  best  of  the  Company's knowledge,  no  other  government,  court  or  arbitration proceedings  exist  (including  pending  proceedings  or proceedings where the Company and/or the Group might\n\n## 6.1.5 INSURANCE\n\nThe Group transfers its risks to the insurance market when this is the most efficient solution. Default by one or more of  the  Group's  insurers  could  therefore  lead  to  financial losses.\n\nThe  Group  policy  is  to  implement  preventive  programs and purchase insurance coverage to protect its assets and revenue. This policy is embedded within a Group doctrine, which  takes  into  account  current  conditions  in  the insurance  market.  It  is  determined,  coordinated  and overseen by the Risk and Insurance Department. It defines insurance  criteria  for  the  most  significant  risks,  such  as property and business interruption, as well as general and product  liability.  With  this  in  mind,  a  new  insurance program to cover the Group's cyber risks was implemented at the end of 2017.\n\nRisk factors\n\nbe threatened) which could have or have had, in the last 12 months,  a  significant  impact  on  the  financial  position  or profitability of the Company and/or Group. Please refer to the  consolidated  financial  statements  note  9  relating  to provisions for litigation p. 339,\n\n## Risk of regulatory changes\n\nThe Group is not subject to any specific regulations that could have an impact on its financial position, although the Group  companies  that  operate  industrial  sites  are generally  required  to  comply  with  the  specific  national laws and regulations of the country where such sites are located.  Such  is  the  case  for  example,  with  regard  to France, of the regulations applicable to classified sites, and certain regulations relating to the environment.\n\nA  certain  number  of  legislative  measures  are  already  in place in certain countries and regions in which the Group operates.  For  example  at  European  level,  Directive 2003/87/EC of October 13, 2003, known as the 'Quotas Directive'  and  its  successive  amendments,  has  set  a  cap on carbon dioxide emissions and a quota trading system for  certain  large  production  sites.  Notwithstanding  the Group's  efforts  to  reduce  CO2  emissions,  and  more broadly,  the  use  of  best  available  techniques  for  its investments (see section 3.3, p 106) changes in regulations applicable  to  the  Group's  activities  could  impact  the operation  of  its  production  sites,  which  could  have  a material adverse effect on its operation, financial position or results.\n\nLaws and regulations  applicable  to  the  Group's  activities and  to  the  materials  and  products  that  it  uses  in  its activities may  change  in  a  manner  that  could  be unfavorable  to  the  Group.  The  introduction  of  stricter regulations  or  more  diligent  enforcement  of  existing regulations  may  affect  the  conditions  under  which  the Group  operates  its  businesses,  which  could  increase  its operating expenses, limit the scope of its activities or act as a brake on business growth. More generally, the Group cannot  guarantee  that  there  will  be  no  rapid  and/or significant regulatory changes in the future with a material adverse effect on its business, financial position or results.\n\nFor  other  types  of  coverage,  such  as  automobile  fleet insurance, the Risk and Insurance Department advises the individual operating  units  on  policy  content  broker selection  and  which  market  to  consult.  These  are  called 'high-frequency'  risks,  for  which  claims  are  monitored internally  and  appropriate  action  taken.  The  policies  in force in 2022 are the result of the renewal of the policies for 2021.\n\nThe captive insurance company set up to cover property risks was highly successful and delivered real benefits for the Group.\n\nCompanies acquired during the year have been integrated into existing insurance programs.\n\n<!-- image -->",

They are covered by a global program.\n\nThe programs meet the insurance criteria laid down by the Risk and Insurance Department, specifically:\n\n- \u00b7 all policies are 'all risks except';\n- \u00b7 limits on compatible coverage with worst-case scenarios where safety systems operate effectively;\n- \u00b7 deductibles  are  proportionate  to  the  size  of  the  site concerned and cannot be considered as self-insurance.\n\nThese  criteria take into account  current  insurance offerings,  which  exclude  certain  risks  and  cover  natural disasters such as floods, storms, earthquakes or tsunamis only up to a certain amount.\n\nIn extreme scenarios, such events could have a substantial uninsured financial impact in terms of both reconstruction costs and lost production costs.\n\nThe  Risk  and  Insurance  Department's  policy  is  based  on the findings of the annual  audits  carried  out  by independent  prevention  experts  recognized  by  the Group's insurers.  These  audits  give  a  clear  picture  of  the risk  exposure  of  the  main  sites  in  the  event  of  a  fire  or other  incident,  and  provide  an  estimate  of  the  financial consequences in a worst-case scenario.\n\nThe  transfer  of  risk  to  the  insurance  market  takes  place beyond  \u20ac17.5  million  per  claimable  event  for  all  Group entities as from January 1, 2022.\n\nThis  amount  is  self-insured  by  the  Group  through  its captive  insurance  company.  The  latter  has  taken  out reinsurance  protection  to  protect  it  against  an  excessive frequency and/or severity.\n\n## Coverage of the risk of civil liability\n\nA  program  provides  coverage  for  third-party  personal injury  and  property  damage  claims  for  which  the  Group would  be  legally  held  liable.  This  program  comprises several programs for the lower tranches of coverage.\n\nThe  first  program  covers  all  subsidiaries  and  has  a coverage  limit  of  \u20ac100  million.  Those  located  in  North\n\n\u00cb\n\nAmerica are subject to a deductible of US$50 million. The program's exclusions are consistent with market practice and concern in particular potentially carcinogenic substances and gradual pollution.\n\nIn order to satisfy local regulatory requirements, a policy is taken  out  in  each  country  in  which  the  Group  has  a significant  presence.  Local  policies  are  backed  up  by  the master policy issued in Paris, which can be activated when local coverage proves inadequate.\n\nThe second program, with a cover limit of US$50 million, concerns  the  subsidiaries  located  in  North  America.  This program is structured differently to deal with the specific nature  of  liability  risks  in  the  United  States.  It  is  divided into several lines of coverage, requiring it to be placed, if needed, on the London insurance market. Exclusions are in line with current market practice in the United States and primarily concern contractual liability, pollution and thirdparty consequential loss.\n\nIn  addition  to  the  two  programs  described  above,  a number of supplementary programs have been set up in order  to  bring  the  total  coverage  limit  to  a  level considered compatible with the Group's businesses.\n\nWithin  the  operating  units,  action  is  taken  to  raise awareness  of  civil  liability  risks,  and  the  units  are motivated to control costs by assuming a deductible that does  not,  however,  constitute  self-insurance.  The  Group also runs a risk prevention program at its operating units with  the  support  of  the  Environment,  Health  and  Safety Department.\n\nFurthermore, to meet the environmental requirements set out  in  Directive  2004/35/EC  of  April  21,  2004  on environmental  liability  with  regard  to  the  prevention  and remedying of environmental damage, the Group has since 2017 had a specific policy with a limit currently set at \u20ac75 million  per  year.  This  policy  offers  worldwide  cover, excluding  the  United  States,  for  the  Group's  civil environmental  liability  arising  in  relation  to  damage affecting natural resources (protected natural species and habitats, soil and water) as a result of its activities.\n\n## Exceptions\n\nJoint  ventures  not  controlled  by  the  Group  and  minority interests  are  excluded  from  the  scope  of  the  above policies. These insurance policies are taken out separately.",

The companies have access to Shared Services Centers (Finance, Human Resources Payroll, IT). It is essential that there is a segregation of tasks  between these organizations for successful skills optimization and transaction security;\n- \u00b7 In the second line, Group Internal Control establishes an internal control reference framework applicable to all, in addition to specific guidelines prepared by the Group's corporate departments; and\n- \u00b7 The  third  line  involves  verification  of  the  proper application  of  the  internal  control  principles  which  is carried  out  in-house  by  the  Audit  Department  and externally by the Statutory Auditors.\n\nEach  level  of  the  organization  plays  a  role  in  internal control,  and  risk  management,  which  affect  all  Group employees. The three lines of defense model is therefore adopted by Saint -Gobain:\n\n## 6.2.1 COMPAGNIE DE SAINT-GOBAIN'S INTERNAL CONTROL AND RISK MANAGEMENT SYSTEM\n\n## The aims of internal control and risk management\n\nThe  Saint -Gobain  internal  control  and  risk  management system  is  part  of  the  legal  framework  applicable  to companies listed on the Euronext Paris regulated market, and is inspired by the reference framework on the internal control and risk management system of the AMF (French Financial  Markets  Authority)  and  the  'Committee  of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission' (COSO).\n\nSaint -Gobain Group's internal control and risk management  system  is  supported  by  a  continuous improvement  process  and  an  Internal  Control  Reference Framework.  This  is  a  whole  set  of  resources,  behaviors, procedures  and  actions  tailored  to  each  company's specific characteristics which:\n\n- \u00b7 enables it to appropriately address material operational, financial or compliance risks;\n- \u00b7 helps  it  to  manage  its  operations  and  meet  its objectives;\n- \u00b7 improves  the  efficiency  of  its  operations  and  ensure that its resources are used to best effect.\n\nIt  is  more  specifically  designed  to  provide  assurance concerning:\n\n- \u00b7 application  of  General  Management's  instructions  and orientations;\n- \u00b7 compliance with the laws and regulations applicable to the company;\n- \u00b7 the  efficiency  and  effectiveness  of  internal  operating, industrial, marketing, financial and other processes;\n- \u00b7 the  protection  of  property,  plant  and  equipment  and intangible assets, in particular the prevention of fraud;\n- \u00b7 the reliability of financial information.\n\nBy  promoting  continuous  improvement  in  all  entities, internal control creates value and supports the companies' performance.\n\n## The internal control and risk management environment\n\n## The Group's core\n\nInternal  control  is  based  on  values  and  rules  of  conduct which are formalized in:\n\n- \u00b7 the  Saint -Gobain  Group  Principles  of  Conduct  and Action:  professional  commitment,  respect  for  others, integrity,  loyalty,  solidarity,  compliance  with  the  law, respect  for  the  environment,  protection  of  health  and safety  at  work  and  employee  rights  (see  section  1.1.3, p.  16).  The  Principles  of  Conduct  and  Action  are distributed to all Group employees; the Group's Human Rights policy (see section 1.5.3, p. 60);\n- \u00b7 the  Saint -Gobain  Attitudes:  being  close  to  clients, acting  as  an  entrepreneur,  innovating,  being  flexible, building an open and engaging culture;\n- \u00b7 the  Group's  compliance  program:  competition  law, economic sanctions and export control, anti-corruption, influence peddling and fraud, professional associations, conflicts of interest, gift policy, personal data protection, etc. (see section 6.2.5, p. 273).\n\nExecutives leading by example, and control at all levels in implementing  the  Principles  is  essential  in  disseminating these values, which all Group employees must adhere to.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Regions, countries and activities formalize  guidelines  and  directives  within  their  scope  of responsibility in line with the Group's own guidelines and directives, ensuring that they are applied when conducting operations.\n\n## Information systems\n\nThe  Group's  organizations  and  their  operations  rely  to  a large  extent  on  information  systems,  information-sharing and  the  digitalization  of  processes.  Information  systems must  therefore  be  efficiently  protected  in  terms  of  both physical  and  logical  security.  The  Saint -Gobain  Group companies thus comply with the security rules set out by the Group 'Digital & IT' Department and Internal Control (automated  controls  described  in  detail  in  the  'ITAC' reference base).\n\n## Internal control and risk management process\n\nWithin  Saint -Gobain,  internal  control  is  a  continuous  and ongoing process that integrates risk management procedures.\n\nDue  to  the  constantly  changing  environment  and  the regulatory  context,  the  companies  must  take  steps  to identify,  evaluate,  process  and  monitor  any  risks  which may affect them.\n\n## At Group entity level\n\nThe internal control and risk management process can be summarized in four stages:\n\n- \u00b7 analysis  of  the  main  identifiable  risks.  The  company analyzes  the  main  risks  that  could  prevent  it  from meeting  its  objectives,  as  well  as  dangers  that  could harm its interests or have a major impact on its internal control situation;\n- \u00b7 developing controls that are proportionate to the risks involved in each process;\n- \u00b7 communicating  the  objectives  of  internal  control  to employees and implementing controls;\n- \u00b7 permanent  oversight  of  and  regular  checks  on  the effectiveness of internal control: an internal control selfassessment  or  'compliance  statement'  is  therefore signed  each  year  by  the  Chief  Executive  Officers according  to  the  scope  defined  for  each  annual campaign.\n\nThis process is described in the Internal Control Reference Framework (see section 6.2.5, p. 273) and applies to the entire Group.\n\n## At the level of Compagnie de Saint -Gobain\n\nThe Audit, Risks and Internal Control Department updates the Group's risk mapping every year. These updates draw on  the  contributions  of  the  various  management  levels, and  the  results  are  submitted  to  the  Audit  and  Risk Committee and the Board of Directors.\n\nFor  the  various  risks  analyzed,  the  necessary  corrective action is taken.\n\n## 6.2.2 PARTIES INVOLVED IN INTERNAL CONTROL AND RISK MANAGEMENT\n\nEveryone within the organization has some responsibility for  internal  control  and  risk  management,  from  General Management  down  to  the  employees  of  the  individual entities.\n\n## The Board of Directors of Compagnie de Saint -Gobain and the Audit and Risk Committee\n\nThe  Audit  and  Risk  Committee  periodically  reviews  the organization  of  the  Group's  internal  control  and  risk management (see section 5.1.2, p. 191).\n\nThe Audit and Risk Committee is specifically tasked with monitoring the process of preparing financial information and  the  effectiveness  of  the  internal  control  and  risk management system.\n\nIt also reviews the risks map prepared by the Audit, Risks and Internal Control Department.\n\nIt  analyzes significant internal control incidents, results of audits  and  oversees  the  corrective  actions  necessary  to address failures.\n\n\u00cb\n\nFinally, it reports regularly to the Board of Directors on its work  and  notifies  the  Board  promptly  of  any  issues encountered (see section 5.1.2, p. 191).\n\n## Group Management\n\nSaint -Gobain's  Management  oversees  implementation  of the Group's internal control and risk management system and the existence and effectiveness of appropriate internal control monitoring systems within the Group's subsidiaries.\n\nIn  this  context,  the  Chairman  of  the  Board  of  Directors signed a charter on April 16, 2021 with the Audit, Risks and Internal  Control  Department to reiterate the principles of audit, internal control and risk management which support the Group's teams.",

        "page_content": "## 6.2.3 THE INTERNAL CONTROL AND RISK MANAGEMENT SYSTEM IN THE GROUP ENTITIES\n\nEach  entity  is  responsible  for  implementing  an  internal control and risk management system that is appropriate to its needs and aligned with the Group's internal control and risk  management  system.  Each  Managing  Director  is responsible for:\n\n- \u00b7 the  relevance  and  effectiveness  of  the  internal  control system in place within their entity;\n- \u00b7 its compliance with the Group's internal control system;\n- \u00b7 appropriate  management  of  the  risks  faced  by  their entity.\n\nThis  responsibility  cannot  be  delegated.  Management exercises  this  by  relying  on  the  company's  corporate Directors, operational staff and the site Directors.\n\nTo  build  an  internal  control  system  adapted  to  their activity, the Chief Executive Officers of the companies aim to:\n\n- \u00b7 establish the fundamental bases for internal control and risk management,  and  in  particular  the  controls described in the Internal Control Reference Framework;\n- \u00b7 adapt the internal control and risk management system by  analyzing  specific  risks  and  enhancing  the  internal control  system  to  include  checks  tailored  to  the management of identified risks;\n- \u00b7 roll  out  the  internal  control  and  risk  management system on all of the sites;\n- \u00b7 oversee  the  internal  control  and  risk  management system.\n\n## 6.2.4 THE PROCEDURE FOR MONITORING THE INTERNAL CONTROL AND RISK MANAGEMENT SYSTEM\n\nThe Audit, Risks and Internal Control Department monitors the  internal  control  and  risk  management  systems  using four main factors:\n\n- \u00b7 compliance statement;\n- \u00b7 internal audits;\n- \u00b7 action plan monitoring;\n- \u00b7 monitoring of fraud and incidents.\n\nThe results of this oversight are reported to the Audit and Risk Committee.\n\n## The Compliance Statement\n\nThe  Managing  Directors,  for  the  applicable  management levels, report to the Group's General Management on their levels  of  internal  control  via  an  annual  compliance statement.\n\nThe  form  includes  a  certain  number  of  key  checks extracted from the Internal Control Reference Framework.\n\nThe Chief Executive Officer must provide assurances that:\n\n- \u00b7 the  controls  selected  are  implemented  in  a  compliant and efficient manner;\n- \u00b7 the action plans arising from the self-assessment have been activated and implemented within the given time frames;\n- \u00b7 significant internal control incidents, fraud and breaches of the Principles of Conduct and Action were reported to the Audit, Risks and Internal Control Department or via the Group whistle-blowing system.\n\nThe Managing Directors make a personal commitment to the accuracy of the self-assessment by signing a letter of commitment at the end of the form.\n\nAt the second level, the Directors of Clusters, Regions and HPS validate all compliance statements belonging to their respective scopes.\n\nThe  compliance  statements  and  the  action  plans  are gathered, summarized and monitored by the Audit, Risks and Internal Control Department. They are covered in an annual  report  to  the  Group's  Management  team  and  the Audit and Risk Committee.\n\n## Internal audits\n\nInternal audits are centralized at Compagnie de Saint -Gobain level. The Vice-President of Audit, Risks and Internal  Control  reports  to  the  Chief  Executive  Officer  of the Group. Internal auditors located at the headquarters or in  the  regions  report  directly  to  the  Audit,  Risks  and Internal Control Department and work under its authority.\n\nThe  audits  are  scheduled  based  on  long-term,  predetermined criteria, in line with a yearly audit plan which is designed  taking  into  account  the  requirements  of  the Group's General Management, corporate departments and operational departments. The audit plan prepared by the Audit, Risks and Internal Control Department is approved by the Audit and Risk Committee.\n\nThe  aim  of  the  audits  is  to  evaluate  the  relevance  and effectiveness of the internal control systems of the Group and  its  subsidiaries  and  to  carry  out  cross-business missions  with  an  operational  benefit.  Generally,  they include an examination of the internal control environment, risk analysis system, internal control organization  and  procedures,  information  systems  and  a selection of processes.\n\nInternal control\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\nInternal control\n\nThe auditors use IT tools provided to them to analyze the data systematically (data analytics) and share the results operationally with the entities:\n\n- \u00b7 a  performance-oriented  tool  for  process  analysis  that can  be  used  to  analyze  and  represent  an  entity's organizational  structure  and  its  processes,  to  identify bottlenecks and irregularities in process flows;\n- \u00b7 a conformance-oriented data analysis tool that is useful in targeted  searches  for  inconsistencies  with  the internal control rules in place.\n\nThese two highly complementary tools thoroughly analyze the  populations  concerned  (transactions,  master  files, access rights, etc.), so that anomalies can be detected and the most reliable conclusions reached.\n\nAt  the  end  of  the  work,  the  internal  auditors  design  a priority  action  plan  in  conjunction  with  the  entity  which should improve the coverage of the risks identified; they also produce a report setting out their main observations and  recommendations.  The  report  is  then  sent  to  the Group's General Management  and  the operational department to which the entity reports.\n\n## Action plan monitoring\n\nThe 'INTERACT' integrated audit and internal control tool centralizes:\n\n- \u00b7 actions taken to correct the non-compliance identified during the annual campaign of compliance statements;\n- \u00b7 the  priority  action  plans  defined  following  the  audits carried out;\n- \u00b7 the  main  actions  defined  as  part  of  the  annual  risk mapping campaign.\n\nThe INTERACT tool also enables entities to trigger action plans independently, as part of a dynamic management of their internal control.\n\nThis  means  that  each  Group  company  has  access  to  a centralized operational platform it can use to manage its action  plans  by  reporting  the  corrective  measures  taken and  the  progress  made  compared  with  the  predefined implementation schedule. The corporate departments can also use the system to monitor these action plans.\n\nFurthermore,  a  dashboard  circulated  at  the  Group's different management levels makes it possible to monitor the  results  of  the  compliance  statements,  internal  audit grades and the progress of the related action plans.\n\n\u00cb\n\n## Monitoring of fraud and internal control incidents\n\nFraud  and  other  major  internal  control  incidents  are closely monitored by the Audit and Risk Committee.\n\n## Facts to be reported to the Group\n\n- \u00b7 Accounting  anomalies  and  alterations  which  damage the integrity of the financial information, irrespective of whether they are favorable or unfavorable to the entity or the Group;\n- \u00b7 Misappropriation  or  jeopardizing  of  assets,  whether tangible or intangible;\n- \u00b7 Events  likely  to  be  construed  as  acts  of  passive  or active corruption, or influence peddling;\n- \u00b7 Violations of laws and regulations;\n- \u00b7 Other  violations  of  the  Principles  of  Conduct  and Action.\n\n## Alert procedure\n\n## Fraud alert procedure\n\nThe Group's Fraud Officer ensures monitoring by applying a  single,  centralized  procedure  which  all  of  the  Group's subsidiaries  must  follow.  The  facts  are  reported  via  the Group  Whistle-blowing  System  or  by  using  a  standard form  available  on  the  Security  Intranet  under  the  fraud section, which describes the facts and the measures taken. The  declaration  is  updated  by  the  entity  as  necessary. These declarations are then communicated by the Fraud Officer to the relevant management bodies.\n\n## Group whistle-blowing system\n\nThe  Group's  internal  whistle-blowing  system  makes  it possible to collect reports from any employee concerning conduct  or  situations  which  are  contrary  to  the  Group's Principles  of  Conduct  and  Action  and  the  Group's  AntiCorruption  policy,  offenses  or  crimes  or  serious  and obvious  violations  of  laws  or  regulations  (for  details,  see the Saint -Gobain Group Alert System policy). The internal whistle-blowing  system  is  accessible  at  the  following address: https://www.bkms-system.com/bkwebanon/ report/clientInfo?cin=CwmSdg&c=-1&language=eng.\n\nWhen the eligibility conditions for the report are met, the reported  facts  are  investigated  in  a  professional  and independent  manner.  Investigations  are  coordinated  by duly trained alert examiners.\n\n## Whistle-blower protection system\n\nThe  whistle-blower  is  protected  under  the  terms  of  the Whistle-blowing policy.",

Each  ICRF  control  is referenced  against  the  relevant  risk  sub-categories.  Each process  contains  a  control/risk  matrix  used  to  refer specifically  to  risk  types  by  control  and  contributing  to understanding the control system.\n\nSection  3  of  the  Internal  Control  Reference  Framework presents the list of mandatory controls to be implemented by all Group subsidiaries (250 controls in the 2023 version).\n\n## The Mini ICRF\n\nThis  framework  has  the  same  structure  as  the  standard ICRF with 17 chapters. It sets out 100 controls, which have been  carefully  selected  and  developed  for  small  entities. The  Mini  ICRF  also  presents  a  practical  tool  for  the consolidation of newly acquired companies.\n\nThe  Automated  Control  Reference  Framework  (ITAC) supplements  the  Group's  Internal  Control  Reference Framework (ICRF) and lists the controls that are wholly or partially  automatable,  the  implementation  of  which  is mandatory. The Group companies are responsible for the implementation  of  this  reference  framework  in  the business applications within their scope (e.g. SAP) in order to  guarantee  the  perpetuation  of  the  control,  limit  its recurring  costs  and  minimize  the  risk  of  human  error  or fraud.\n\nIn  the  2023  edition  of  the  ITAC  standard,  which  covers eight  processes,  there  are  97  controls  listed.  They  are divided into three categories: automated process, automated  workflow  approval  and  automated  reporting (R).\n\nThere are also two thematic manuals.\n\n## ICQRF\n\nThe ICQRF (Internal Control Quality Reference Framework) manual deals with internal control applied to quality.\n\n## ACRF\n\nThe ACRF (Anti-corruption Reference Framework) manual summarizes  the  internal  controls  related  to  the  fight against corruption and influence peddling.\n\nAll of the reference frameworks are available on the Audit, Risks and Internal Control Intranet.\n\nOther tools are also available on the Intranet site to help entities implement the controls (tool box: typical procedures,  flow  diagrams,  library  of  controls)  and  best practices.\n\nThe best practices are compiled by:\n\n- \u00b7 the  Internal  Audit  Department  -  auditors  gather  best practices during their audit missions;\n- \u00b7 the  Internal  Control  Department,  using  a  system  of external  monitoring  (notably  the  French  Audit  and Internal Control Institute, IFACI);\n- \u00b7 entities that agree to share their tools.\n\n<!-- image -->",

It  is based on the principle of continuous improvement. It takes into account:\n\n- \u00b7 international management standards in the three areas of EHS: ISO 45001: 2018 for health and safety and ISO 14001: 2015 for the environment;\n- \u00b7 the specific requirements of Saint -Gobain, in particular the Group's EHS standards.\n\nThe EHS Reference Framework was updated in 2021. It is based  on  the  conviction  that  the  implementation  of  an effective  EHS  management  system  in  the  branches  is  a necessary  condition  for  the  long-term  improvement  of their EHS performance.\n\nThe  implementation  of  the  requirements  of  the  EHS Standard  is  assessed  through  ISA  (Integrated  System Assessment)  audits  launched  in  2018  for  the  industrial scope.  An  audit  system  more  suitable  for  institutions whose management system is not ISO-certified, called the ISA-MINI  audit,  was  developed  in  2020  and  gradually rolled out since 2021. A new version of the ISA audit was developed  and  tested  in  2022  to  take  into  account  the evolution of the EHS Standard in 2021, and was launched in 2023. The reflection on the EHS Saint -Gobain audits at the  Distribution  sites  was  conducted  in  2022,  leading  to the launch of a new audit tool for distribution sites in 2023.\n\nEach country is in charge of defining its multi-year audit program according to the prioritization criteria proposed by the central EHS team. The objective is to target sites and entities that need audit recommendations to progress.\n\nFurthermore, the EHS Department continues to work with its network to develop and update Group EHS standards, which describe the minimum applicable requirements and/ or  methodologies.  These  standards  help  to  ensure  that risks are assessed and controlled on the same basis in all Group  entities,  irrespective  of  the  country  and  the  local laws  and  regulations.  Among  the  documents  made available to the sites for the implementation of standards, there are implementation guides, examples of procedures, training materials including eLearning modules, questionnaires for assessing the implementation of standards and IT tools. Every year and as needed, certain documents  and  tools  are  updated  or  added.  Two  safety standards  were  updated  in  2023:  'Vehicles  used  in  the workplace' and 'working at heights'. An eLearning module on  Work  Permits  was  also  finalized.  A  guide  specifically dedicated  to  managing  dangerous  situations  that  could lead  to  serious  accidents  has  been  produced,  together with an eLearning module.",

It  includes,  for  example,  the EHS training matrix updated in 2023.\n\nFinally,  the  Group  provides  a  set  of  EHS  IT  applications (eSuite) in the manufacturing digital hub managed by the OPEX  (Operational  Exchange)  department.  These  help with  the  reporting  of  events  (eEvent),  risk  assessment (eRisk),  collection  of  data  during  security  visits  (eSMAT), completion  of  questionnaires  (eCheck)  and  management of EHS action plans (eAction).\n\n## General doctrine on information systems security\n\nThe  Information  Systems  Department  compiles  security rules and policies concerning the information systems and networks,  based  on  four  sets  of  compulsory  minimum security rules in the following areas:\n\n- \u00b7 infrastructure,  with  23  minimum  security  rules  (31 control  points,  94  entities)  and  IT  Security  Reporting (34  control  points,  17  local  IT  Services  covering  776 entities);\n- \u00b7 applications  and  websites,  with  the  minimum  security rules (50 control points);\n- \u00b7 industrial information technology systems, with 28  minimum  security  rules  (68  control  points,  891 entities, including 189 with critical or large industrial IT systems);\n- \u00b7 the  hosting  of  resources  in  the  Datacenters  or  Cloud solutions  operated  by  partners  led  by  GDI  or  local  IT Services  (99  control  points,  17  Datacenters/private Cloud  solutions,  33  Cloud  Public  security  rules,  one Cloud Public Azure solution).\n\nThese  rules  are  the  operational  application  by  area  of another  two  key  high-level  documents  in  the  new  IT security document reference system:\n\n- \u00b7 the  General  IT  Security  policy  letter,  ensuring  the importance  of  this  issue  and  its  sponsorship  by  top management;\n- \u00b7 the  Group  Information  Systems  Security  policy,  an essential repository;\n- \u00b7 the  reference  framework  for  short  and  medium-term actions  to  strengthen  Saint -Gobain's  cyber-defense against new cyber-attacks. This framework is implemented in a continuous cybersecurity improvement plan adapted to each Business organization and Group teams. This plan covers global infrastructure,  local  infrastructure,  applications  and websites, and industrial systems.\n\nThese  rules  are  also  supplemented  downstream  by periodically updated  technical  standards  to  monitor technological developments  and  control  application, industrial and infrastructure services.\n\nThe Information Systems Department has notably defined and rolled out:\n\n- \u00b7 a  tool  (GRC,  Governance  Risk  and  Compliance)  for controlling  SAP  user  rights  and  managing  conflicting segregations  of  duties.  This  tool  will  be  gradually integrated into all the Group's SAP systems;\n\nInternal control\n\n- \u00b7 a technical standard (SAP4SG) to improve the security of SAP environments. A tool is being rolled out across 47 SAP environments hosted by GDI in the Kyndryl (P1) Datacenter to monitor and check the points covered by this standard:\n- -implementing  security  patches  in  SAP  production and non-production environments,\n- -the  technical  configuration  of  the  environments  to improve security,\n- -the  monitoring  of  technical  roles,  profiles  and accounts, as well as high privilege accounts;\n- \u00b7 a technical standard to manage technical and business accounts  that  have  access  to  applications  (ATA/ABA, Application  Technical  Accounts/Application  Business Accounts);\n- \u00b7 a standard  for  the  secure  development  of  web applications (WASD, Web Application Secured Development  3.3)  as  well  as  the  SSDLC  (Secure Software Development Life Cycle) policy;\n- \u00b7 a  technical  standard  to  secure  the  hosting  of  internet applications (SHIA);\n- \u00b7 a  technical  standard  for  SaaS  systems  which  defines responsibilities and security measures for implementation;\n- \u00b7 a series of security rules for the annual security control of  the  central  and  regional  datacenters  (Datacenter Security  Rules  4  SG)  and  the  Public  Cloud  Security Rules;\n- \u00b7 a  technical  standard  for  the  security  of  applications hosted by Saint -Gobain partners for publication on the internet;\n- \u00b7 the  methodology  for  the  assessment  of  Cybersecurity risks used to assess the measures to be implemented to integrate security into all projects from the first stage, and into contracts with suppliers.\n\nIn  addition,  an  ITAC  (Information  Technology Automated Controls) repository has been published since 2012 and is updated  regularly.  It  is  a  complement  to  the  Internal Control Reference Framework that describes the automatic or semi-automatic IT controls of key purchasing, sales, inventory, production, human resources, treasury and accounting processes. It is valid for all Group ERPs (SAP, Movex, QAD, Exact).\n\n## Industrial and distribution risk prevention manual\n\nThe Group's policy for prevention of property damage and the  resulting  operating  losses,  compiled  as  part  of  an internal  collection  of  standards  and  best  practices,  is defined  by  the  Risk  and  Insurance  Department.  The  Risk and Insurance Department coordinates the implementation  of  the  policy  by  the  Group's  operational entities in its different business lines.\n\nWithin the business lines and regional entities, Prevention Coordinators  manage  the  application  of  Group  policy within the scope of their activities.\n\nAt  site  level,  those  in  charge  of  Prevention  Management perform  an  annual  self-assessment  of  risks  at  their  sites using  a  risk  rating  software  package.  This  tool  assesses risks as well as the corresponding levels of protection and prevention.  This  self-assessment  is  updated  annually  by the  industrial  sites, the  Research  and  Development Centers and logistical sites. A special assessment is carried out for the sales outlets.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The sites  update  their  action  plans  with  a  view  to  improving their level of prevention  and  protection  based  on recommendations prepared by these prevention engineers.\n\n## Tools of the Group's compliance culture\n\nThe  culture  of  compliance  that  drives  the  Group  has developed through its values, which are formally stated in the Principles of Conduct and Action.\n\nThe ethics and compliance program is strongly focused on the  prevention  and  detection  of  risks  and  is  now structured around  the  following  main  themes:  the promotion and defense of the Principles of Conduct and Action; the fight against corruption and influence peddling; the prevention of money laundering; compliance with the rules on competition law, economic sanctions and export  control;  monitoring  of  the  vigilance  plan  and respect for human rights; and personal data protection.\n\nThe tools used in implementing the program include:\n\n- \u00b7 a  dedicated  intranet,  called  Compliance,  on  which  key messages are posted and tools made available;\n- \u00b7 online  training  modules  such  as  Adhere  (Principles  of Conduct  and  Action),  ACT  (preventing  corruption), Comply  (competition  law),  and  SGU  -  Economic Sanctions and Export Control -Saint-Gobain Embargoes  (rules  relating  to  economic  sanctions  and embargoes, for persons concerned);\n- \u00b7 in-person, hybrid or team training;\n- \u00b7 the  dissemination  and  implementation  of  internal policies such as:\n- -the  policy  on  the  alert  system  in  place  at  the Saint -Gobain Group,\n- -the anti-corruption policy and  its procedures, particularly relating to gifts and invitations, conflicts of interest, or sponsorship and patronage operations,\n- -the Group policy on management of the corruption risk by Human Resources,\n- -sales agents and intermediaries policy,\n- -the 'buyer' and 'supplier' charters,\n- -policy on economic sanctions and control of exports, and related procedures;\n- \u00b7 membership in professional associations policy;\n- \u00b7 distribution of practical and technical guides:\n- -the Thread of Competition,\n- -20 best practices in competition law for purchasers,\n- -best  human  rights  practices  (child  labor,  forced labor,  worker  housing,  recruitment  agencies  and security forces),\n- -the Lexia video on the alert system;\n- \u00b7 frequent  dissemination  of  messages  by  the  Chief Executive  Officer,  the  Corporate  Secretary  and  the Chief  Executive  Officers  of  the  regions,  countries  and activities  of  the  Saint -Gobain  Group,  via  the  Skyline publication or other forums;\n- \u00b7 a network of compliance and ethics managers present locally and covering, within their respective scopes, all the matters concerned.\n\n## 6.2.6 ORGANIZATION OF INTERNAL CONTROL IN PREPARING AND PROCESSING FINANCIAL AND ACCOUNTING INFORMATION TO THE SHAREHOLDERS\n\n## Compagnie de Saint -Gobain individual (parent company) financial statements\n\nThe Accounting Department is responsible for producing financial  information  for  shareholders,  partners  and  other third parties in accordance with French legal requirements. This  information  is  prepared  using  the  standards  and principles in force. These are generally accepted principles such  as  the  going  concern  principle,  the  principles  of consistent application of accounting policies, alignment of the  opening  balance  sheet  with  the  prior-period  closing balance sheet, recognition of expenses in the same period as  the  income  to  which  they  relate,  segregation  of accounting periods and substance over form.\n\n## Accounting organization\n\nThe  accounting  organization  is  based  on  the  rules, methods and procedures set out in the Group's doctrine memos.  It enables the monthly  reconciliation and substantiation of the accounts and the true and fair view of the events which are represented. The organization also has an advisory role and works upstream to anticipate the accounting impacts of events and the regulatory changes that are likely to have a material impact on the Company's financial statements.\n\n\u00cb\n\nThe chart of accounts is aligned with the Company's needs in terms of classification of transactions, and complies with the  materiality  principle.  It  is  linked  to  the  Group's Financial Information system.\n\n## Internal control\n\nOn  the  one  hand,  internal  control  is  based  on  periodic assessments of the process for preparing accounting and financial information.\n\nIn addition  to  controlling  compliance  with  payment authorization procedures and the double signature rule for secure  payment  means,  the  Accounting  Department contributes  to  internal  control  by  acting  as  guarantor  in respect of responsibilities defined by General Management and  formalized  through  a  cost  accounting  system organized  by  cost  center.  Specifically, cost center managers receive monthly schedules listing the expenses incurred  under  their  signature,  allowing  them  to  check these  expenses  and  also  to  compare  actual  and  year-todate expenses with the initial budget.\n\nA summary of these cost accounting reports is sent to the Finance Department and the Group's General Management at the end of each month.",

To  do  so,  it  has  a  consolidation manual,  several  entry  aid  guides,  an  intranet  site  and  an online training tool in French and English. New consolidation  instructions  are  issued  for  each  monthly closing,  describing  the  changes  compared  with  the previous  period-end  and  enhancements  to  reporting systems,  standards  and  procedures,  in  collaboration  with the Group's Accounting Standards and Pension Liabilities Department.\n\n## Group standards\n\nThe  Consolidation  Department  provides  information  and periodic  training  for  the  subsidiaries  in  conjunction  with the  Regions  and  HPS.

They  are  processed and  controlled  by  the  Consolidation  Department  and  by each  Region  and  HPS.  The  Consolidation  Department reviews  the  Group's  financial  statements  as  a  whole  and makes  the  necessary adjustments to prepare the consolidated  financial  statements.  These  consolidated accounts  are  submitted  to  General  Management  every month.\n\nInternal control\n\nThe consolidated financial  statements  are  then  examined by the Statutory Auditors in accordance with professional Auditing Standards.\n\n## Consolidation tools\n\nThe consolidated financial statements are prepared using consolidation software equipped with a powerful, efficient and  highly  secure  database  aligned  with  the  Group's structure. The software is regularly updated to guarantee the  financial  information  system's  sustainability.  A  tightly controlled access procedure has also been put in place to ensure that the overall system  is secure, and  a comprehensive access review is performed once a year.\n\nThis tool manages a common database that contains the data of all of the Group's consolidated entities.\n\nIt feeds data into a secure reporting system accessible on the Group's Intranet, for the Group's General Management and the Region and HPS Management, contributing to the internal control of information output.\n\n## Account reliability through the reporting\n\nThe  monthly  reporting  process  ensures  that  the  annual and interim consolidated financial statements are reliable. Hard closes  are  performed  at  May  31  and  October  31,  to reduce the workload at June 30 and December 31. These two  closes  are  thoroughly  reviewed  in  accordance  with the  same  principles  as  the  annual  and  interim  financial statements. At this time, the main financial managers from the Company and Regions analyze in detail the net income and  the  hard  close  balance  sheet.  The  entities'  accounts are  then  analyzed  before  the  final  closing  dates  and  are reviewed by the Statutory Auditors. This procedure helps to ensure  early  detection  of  any  errors  and  their adjustment during the actual close.\n\nA  consolidated  report  is  prepared  each  month  for  the Company's General Management, with supporting comments  and  analyses  of  material  events  over  the period.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Compagnie  de Saint-Gobain,  Exane  SA  and  BNP  Paribas  Arbitrage  have agreed to the sale of the liquidity agreement by Exane SA to  BNP  Paribas  Arbitrage,  with  effect  from  October  23, 2023.  With  the  exception  of  the  change  in  counterparty, the provisions of the liquidity agreement remain unchanged and continue to apply.\n\nThe  resources  provided  by  Compagnie  de  Saint -Gobain under this contract entered into in June 2019 and applied to  the  credit  of  the  liquidity  account  amounted  to \u20ac4,002,006.22 and to 21,000 Compagnie de Saint -Gobain shares  (compared  to  \u20ac5  million  under  the  previous contract). At December 31, 2023, the liquidity account held 5,300 shares and had a credit balance of \u20ac6.2 million.\n\nDuring  the  2023  fiscal  year,  cumulative  purchases  under the  liquidity  agreement  involved  1,705,916  shares  at  an average price of \u20ac54.76 while 1,730,366 shares were sold at an average price of \u20ac54.86.

Most recently, on June 12, 2023, the Caisse des d\u00e9p\u00f4ts et consignations disclosed to the French Financial Markets Authority (AMF) that it had exceeded, on June 8, 2023,  directly  and  indirectly,  the  threshold  of  5%  of  the voting  rights  of  Compagnie  de  Saint -Gobain,  holding, directly  and  indirectly  through  CNP  Assurances,  which  it controls,  3.67%  of  the  share  capital  and  4.57%  of  the voting rights.\n\nThe Caisse des d\u00e9p\u00f4ts et consignations specified that this disclosure threshold statement was the result of the return of Compagnie de Saint -Gobain shares held as collateral by CNP Assurances.\n\n## 7.1.6 EMPLOYEE OWNERSHIP\n\nAt December 31, 2023, Group employees held 8.7% of the share  capital  and  15.3%  of  the  voting  rights  attached  to Compagnie  Saint -Gobain  shares  through  the  Group Savings Plan Funds (1) .  The Group Savings Plan Funds are thus the Group's main shareholder.\n\nThe Group Savings Plan is a key feature of Saint -Gobain's social  contract.  It  represents  an  excellent  mean  of  giving employees a stake in the Group and sharing in its results. By  allowing  employees  to  become  shareholders,  the Group Savings Plan strengthens the motivation and sense of  belonging  of  employees  within  the  Group,  as  well  as aligning their interests with those of shareholders.\n\nEmployee  share  ownership  transactions  have  been  very successful both in France  and  internationally. The ownership  rate  of  the  Group  Savings  Plan  Funds  has remained  stable  over  the  past  10  years,  although  the Company  carried  out  capital  increases  reserved  for employees  each  year  (8.4%  of  the  capital  held  by  the Group Savings Plan Funds (fonds commun de placement d'entreprise,  FCPE)  as  at  December  31,  2013  compared with  8.7%  at  December  31,  2023).  This  stability  can  be explained in particular by employees' periodic disposals of available assets.\n\nCapital stock\n\n## Statutory disclosure thresholds\n\nIn  addition,  the  Company  received  several  notifications during the year in respect of the obligation set out in the Company's  bylaws  to  disclose  any  and  all  changes  in interest  to  above  or  below  0.5%  of  the  share  capital  or voting  rights,  or  any  multiple  thereof.  Those  disclosure statements, upwards  or  downwards,  were  received following the sale of shares or changes in Compagnie de Saint -Gobain's shares and voting rights.\n\nAt  December  31,  2023,  approximately  61,000  employees of  the  Group  were  shareholders  of  the  Compagnie  de Saint -Gobain through the Group Savings.\n\nIn  2023,  4,778,291  shares  were  issued  under  the  Group Savings  Plan  offering  Group  employees  two  classic formulas  with  a  five-  or  ten-year  lock-up,  for  a  total  of \u20ac211.2 million (compared with 4,916,097 shares and \u20ac222.2 million in 2022).\n\nIn France, 72% of French employees invested in the Group Savings  Plan  through  a  corporate  mutual  fund  (FCPE). Employees  in  27  other  European  countries  and  25 countries outside Europe were also given the opportunity to  take  part  in  the  Group  Savings  Plan.  In  total,  50,395 present  and  former  Group  employees  participated  in  the Group Savings Plan in 2023.\n\nA new plan has been launched in 2024. It gives employees the  opportunity  to  acquire  up  to  6.5  million  shares,  i.e., approximately 1.28% of the share capital, with the classic five- or ten-year lock-up formulas.\n\n<!-- image -->",

This option is provided for only in the following cases: (i) the rating of the bonds concerned  has  been  lowered  from  investment  grade  to non-investment grade by a designated rating agency; (ii)\n\n\u00cb\n\nthe  rating  of  the  bonds  concerned,  which  was  noninvestment  grade,  has  been  lowered  by  one  notch  (e.g. from BB + to BB) by a designated rating agency; (iii) the rating is withdrawn - and, in each of these cases (i) to (iii), the action of the rating agency is expressly linked to the change of control -; or (iv) at the time of the change of control,  the  bonds  concerned  were  not  rated.  The  total outstanding  amount  of  the  borrowings  concerned  at December 31, 2023 was \u20ac11,417 million.\n\nIn addition, the agreement relating to the syndicated bank lines  of  credit  in  support  of  the  general  financing  of  the Group  (dated  December  2023  for  the  amount  of \u20ac4 billion) also contains a change of control clause.\n\nFinally, certain deferred compensation and defined-benefit pension  plans  of  the  Group's  US  subsidiaries  would  be immediately  terminated  in  case  of  change  of  control, causing beneficiaries' rights to become due in 12 months. The  amounts  concerned  total  US$154,904  million  at December 31, 2023.",

They  are expressed in euros rounded to the nearest million.\n\nThese  consolidated  financial  statements  were  adopted  on  February  29,  2024  by  the  Board  of  Directors  and  will  be submitted to the Shareholders' Meeting of June 6, 2024 for approval.\n\nAccounting principles and policies are highlighted in a distinct color.\n\n## NOTE 1 ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES AND POLICIES\n\nThe accounting policies applied are consistent with those used  to  prepare  the  financial  statements  for  the  year ended  December  31,  2022,  except  for  the  application  of the  new  standards  and  interpretations  described  below. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared using  the  historical  cost  convention,  except  for  certain assets  and  liabilities  that  have  been  measured  using  the fair value model as explained in these notes.\n\n## 1.1 Standards applied\n\nThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared in  accordance  with  the  International  Financial  Reporting Standards  (IFRS)  and  interpretations  adopted  for  use  in the  European  Union  at  December  31,  2023.  These consolidated financial statements have also been prepared in  accordance  with  the  IFRS  issued  by  the  International Accounting Standards Board (IASB).\n\n## 1.1.1 Standards, interpretations and amendments to existing standards applicable for reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2023\n\nThe following standards and amendments, effective since January  1,  2023,  were  applied  where  necessary  to  the consolidated  financial  statements  for  the  year  ended December 31, 2023:\n\n- \u00b7 IFRS 17, 'Insurance Contracts', including the amendments published in June 2020;\n- \u00b7 Amendments  to  IFRS  17,  'Insurance Contracts' concerning the presentation of comparative information on initial application of IFRS 17 and IFRS 9;\n- \u00b7 Amendments  to  IAS  1,  'Presentation  of  Financial Statements'  and  IFRS  Practice  Statement  2,  'Making Materiality Judgments', aimed at improving accounting policy  disclosures  and  providing  guidance  on  how  to apply  the  concept  of  materiality  to  accounting  policy disclosures;\n- \u00b7 Amendments to IAS 8, 'Accounting Policies, Changes in  Accounting  Estimates  and  Errors',  clarifying  the distinction  between  changes  in  accounting  estimates and changes in accounting policies;\n- \u00b7 Amendments  to  IAS  12,  'Income  Taxes'  concerning deferred  tax  related  to  assets  and  liabilities  arising from a single transaction;\n- \u00b7 Amendment  to  IAS  12,  \"Income  Taxes\"  concerning international  tax  reform  and  Pillar  Two  model  rules. This  amendment  provides  for  a  mandatory  and temporary exemption to the requirement to recognize deferred taxes associated with Pillar Two income taxes but introduces specific disclosure requirements.\n\nThe  main  finalized  IFRIC  decisions  published  in  2023 concern:\n\n- \u00b7 IFRS 16, 'Leases' - Definition of a Lease - Substitution Rights;\n- \u00b7 IFRS  9,  \"Financial  Instruments\"  -  Guarantee  over  a Derivative Contract;\n\n\u00cb\n\n- \u00b7 IFRS 9, \"Financial instruments\" and IFRS 17, \"Insurance Contracts\" -Premiums Receivable from an Intermediary;\n- \u00b7 IFRS  9,  \"Financial  Instruments\"  and  IAS  19,  \"Employee Benefits\"  -  Home  and  Home  Loans  Provided  to Employees.\n\nThese amendments and decisions have no material impact on the Group's consolidated financial statements.\n\n## 1.1.2 Standards, interpretations and amendments to existing standards available for early adoption in reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2023\n\nThe  new  standards,  interpretations  and  amendments  to existing standards  applicable  to  accounting  periods starting  on  or  after  January  1,  2024  were  not  early adopted by the Group at December 31, 2023.\n\nThey concern:\n\n- \u00b7 The  amendments  to  IFRS  16,  \"Leases\"  relating  to leaseback liabilities in a sale and leaseback;\n- \u00b7 The amendment to IAS 1, 'Classification of Liabilities as Current  or  Non-current',  and  'Non-current  Liabilities with Covenants'.\n\n## 1.1.3 Standards, interpretations and amendments to existing standards published but not yet applicable\n\nThe  new  standards,  interpretations  and  amendments  to existing  standards  that  have  been  published  but  are  not yet applicable concern:\n\n- \u00b7 Amendments  to  IAS  7  and  IFRS  7,  'Supplier  Finance Arrangements';\n- \u00b7 Amendment  to  IAS  21,  \"The  Effects  of  Changes  in Foreign Exchange Rates\" - Lack of Exchangeability.\n\nWhere applicable to Saint-Gobain, these amendments are currently being analyzed by the Group.\n\nDue to its scale, the Saint-Gobain Group is concerned by the  OECD's  Pillar  Two  rules  introducing  a  minimum  tax rate  of  15%,  which  will  be  applicable  as  from  fiscal  year 2024. The impact analyses carried out within the Group on the consequences of the Pillar Two rules, if they had been applied for 2023, show that only a very limited number of small  jurisdictions  would  have  been  likely  to  trigger  the requirement to pay Pillar Two top-up taxes. In contrast, all other  jurisdictions  would  have  been  eligible  for  the transitional  'safe  harbors'  introduced  by  the  OECD  to enable the progressive adoption of the Pillar Two rules.",

These\n\n2023 Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nestimates and assumptions are based on past experience and  on  various  other  factors  in  the  prevailing  economic and  financial  environment  which  makes  it  difficult  to predict future business performance. Actual amounts may differ  from  those  obtained  through  the  use  of  these estimates and assumptions.\n\nThe  main  estimates  and  assumptions  described  in  these notes  concern  the  measurement  of  employee  benefit obligations  and  share-based  payments  (see  note  6, p.  322),  asset  impairment  tests  (notably  the  assumptions used in the tests relating to the Group's commitments to reduce its net carbon emissions) and the determination of lease  terms  (see  note  7,  p.  329),  provisions  for  other liabilities (see note 9, p. 339), the measurement of financial instruments (see note 10, p. 343) and taxes (see note 12, p. 355).\n\n<!-- image -->",

This  environment,  combined  with  heightened geopolitical tensions, is generating commodity and energy price uncertainty as well as a marked economic slowdown, particularly  in  the  construction  sector,  which  is  highly sensitive to interest rate trends.\n\nAmidst higher interest rates and a slowing economy, the Group  continued  its  rigorous  management  of  liquidity, interest  rate  and  foreign  exchange  risks  (see  note  10.1  p. 343), while increasing its oversight and tracking of credit risk  and  continuing  to  apply  its  strict  gas  and  electricity price hedging policy.\n\nInterest rates should nevertheless start to fall in 2024, and the Group is well positioned to take advantage of mediumterm  opportunities  beyond  the  current  downturn,  with housing shortages in the Group's major countries (especially  the  US,  Canada  and  Germany)  and  the  major energy  retrofits  needed  to  meet  climate  objectives representing sources of sustainable growth for Saint -Gobain.\n\n## 2.1 Impact of the Russia-Ukraine conflict on the Group's strategy and financial performance\n\n## Group operating activities\n\nSince  the  outbreak  of  the  conflict  between  Russia  and Ukraine,  in  addition  to  the  Group's  application  of  the sanctions  imposed  against  Russia,  Saint-Gobain  has decided to halt all its exports to customers in Russia and Belarus, and all its imports from these two countries, and has shelved all new investment projects in these countries.\n\nNevertheless, its local Russian operations, which represent around  0.7%  of  the  Group's  worldwide  sales  and  do  not involve  any  local  partnerships,  continue  to  operate autonomously,  with  locally  produced  solutions  sold exclusively on local construction markets.\n\nSaint-Gobain  does  not  have  any  industrial  operations  in Ukraine.\n\nIn  organizational  terms,  Ukraine  is  now  included  in  a Poland-Ukraine cluster falling under the direct responsibility of the management team in Poland.\n\n\u00cb\n\n## Scope of consolidation\n\nInsofar  as  the  Group  continues  to  produce  and  sell  in Russia for the local market, and to ensure its local business can  continue  to  operate  with  complete  autonomy  of management  and  control  of  returns,  Saint-Gobain  still controls its Russian subsidiaries.\n\nIn  accordance  with  IFRS  10,  its  Russian  and  Ukrainian companies  have  not  therefore  been  deconsolidated,  and continue  to  be  included  in  the  Group's  scope  of consolidation  for  the  preparation  of  the  consolidated financial  statements  for  the  year  ended  December  31, 2023.\n\n## Asset impairment review\n\nTotal non-current assets in Russia represent \u20ac161 million, or 0.5% of the Group's total non-current assets.\n\nNo  indication  of  impairment  was  identified  for  these companies. Consequently, no impairment losses related to the Russia-Ukraine conflict were recognized in 2023.\n\n## Financial risks\n\nGiven the Group's limited presence in Russia and Ukraine, the conflict has not generated any credit or liquidity risks, and forex exposure is also being managed effectively.\n\nGroup  cash  and  cash  equivalents  held in Russia represented  1.3%  of  the  Group's  total  cash  and  cash equivalents  at  December  31,  2023.  The  Group  does  not consider the cash and cash equivalents held in Russia to be restricted within the meaning of IAS 7.\n\nSince March 2, 2022, the Group has been using the Russian ruble  exchange  rate  published  by  Reuters  for  the translation of its consolidated financial statements.\n\nWhile  the  Russia-Ukraine  conflict  has  not  had  a  direct material  impact  on  the  financial  statements  for  the  year ended December 31, 2023, the situation remains unstable and  complex.  The  Group  therefore  remains  vigilant  in analyzing the potential future impacts of the conflict.\n\n## 2.2 Impact of the Israel-Palestine conflict on the Group's strategy and financial performance\n\nThe  Group  has  no  operations  in  the  countries  directly involved in this conflict (Israel and Palestine).\n\nNevertheless,  the  Group  is  keeping  a  close  watch  on  its Middle East operations, particularly on account of the risk that the conflict spreads across the rest of the region.",

        "page_content": "## NOTE 3 CLIMATE ISSUES\n\nSustainability  concerns  are  at  the  heart  of  the  Group's strategy  and  are  an  essential  element  in  supporting  its growth. Saint-Gobain's commitment to achieving net-zeroemissions is taken into account in its financial decisions.\n\n## 3.1 The \"net-zero-emissions\" commitment at the heart of the Group's strategy\n\nIn 2019, the Group committed to being net-zero-emissions by 2050. This commitment was approved by the Science Based  Targets  initiative  (SBTi)  in  September  2022, considering  the  Group's  roadmap  to  be  consistent  with the new  net-zero  standard  and  the  Paris  climate agreement.\n\nIn  order  to  be  net-zero-emissions  by  2050,  Saint-Gobain defined a 2030 roadmap in November 2020. The roadmap identifies  the  levers  and  action  plans  that  will  enable  the Group to meet its goal of a 33% reduction in scope 1 and 2 carbon  emissions  in  absolute  terms  compared  to  a  2017 baseline, and a 16% reduction for scope 3 emissions.\n\nThe  Group's  capital  expenditure  is  aligned  with  the investment  requirements  identified  in  this  CO2  roadmap, which covers all of the Group's business activities.\n\nAt  the  end  of  2023,  the  Group  had  already  reduced  its scope 1 and scope 2 CO2 emissions by 34% compared to the 2017 baseline.\n\nAs  well  as  its  commitments  to  reduce  its  emissions through to 2030, the Group seeks to develop and propose solutions to help decarbonize the construction sector and its customers' markets.\n\nThe innovative solutions developed by Saint-Gobain help to:\n\n- \u00b7 improve the energy performance of buildings so as to reduce both the negative impact of construction on the environment  and  their  occupants'  energy  bills,  while also  enhancing  occupant  well-being.  Saint-Gobain's solutions  play  an  important  role  in  the  fight  against climate  change,  since  they  reduce  the  amount  of greenhouse gas emissions by reducing energy use;\n- \u00b7 encourage the replacement of heavy materials (cement, concrete, brick) by light materials (plasterboard structures when feasible);\n- \u00b7 accelerate the decarbonization of heavy materials.\n\nThe Group's High Performance Solutions enable it to meet growing  market  needs  linked  to  the  decarbonization  of construction  processes  and  sustainable  mobility  and industry.\n\nFollowing  the  acquisition  of  Chryso  and  GCP  Applied Technologies  Inc.  (GCP)  in  2023,  the  Group  further strengthened its position in construction chemicals, whose products play a significant role in helping to decarbonize construction through the design of innovative admixtures that reduce the carbon footprint of cement. Saint-Gobain proceeded  to  acquire  IDP  Chemicals  (Egypt),  Menkol (India) and Adfil (Belgium). It also entered into agreements to acquire Izomaks (Saudi Arabia) and Imptek Chova (Ecuador).\n\n2023 Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nIn  order  to  increase  the  percentage  of  sales  represented by its sustainable solutions, Saint-Gobain has developed a method  for  evaluating  the  environmental  benefits  of  its solutions  for  all  stakeholders.  According  to  this  internal method,  the  Group  generated  73%  of  its  sales  from sustainable  solutions  (products  identified  as  being  lowcarbon) in 2023.\n\nAll in all, the Group's initiatives are enabling it to dissociate growth from CO2 emissions: carbon intensity (scopes 1 and 2)  per  euro  of  sales  and  EBITDA  fell  by  44%  and  56%, respectively,  in  2023  compared  with  the  2017  baseline, reflecting the Group's objective of maximizing its positive impact on the environment while reducing its footprint.\n\n## 3.2 Taking into account the \"netzero-emissions\" commitment when preparing the Group's financial statements\n\nIn line with these commitments and targets, the Group has taken  into  account  climate  change  and  sustainable development  issues  in  its  financial  statements,  mainly  in the areas cited below:\n\n## A Group-wide commitment\n\nAll  Regions  and  the  High  Performance  Solutions  (HPS) business have drawn up structured roadmaps for reducing CO2 emissions.\n\nThese  roadmaps  are  broken  down  by  country  or  entity, plant and project, and together, will be used to justify the Group's  2030  scope  1  and  scope  2  emissions  reduction targets and to set objectives for 2030-2050.\n\nThe  roadmaps  are  reviewed  each  year  in  line  with  the Group's  main  financial  deadlines  (strategic  plan,  budget) and  combine  a  large  number  of  potential  improvements, action plans and industrial projects (energy efficiency and energy mix; application of new technologies; growth in the circular economy; product reformulation, streamlining and design, etc.). The roadmaps contain measures for each site designed to reduce scope 1 direct emissions, and take into account  the  growing  number  of  new  Purchase  Power Agreements (PPA) and Virtual Purchase Power Agreements (VPPA) on a country-by-country basis aimed at reducing scope 2 indirect emissions.\n\n2023 was shaped by:\n\n- \u00b7 Further decarbonization of production processes:\n- -Start  of  100%  electric  (100%  renewable  energy) plasterboard  production  at  the  Fredrikstad  plant  in Norway,  and  a  project  to  build  a  second  100% electric  (100%  renewable  energy)  plant  in  Montreal (Canada) under way;\n- -After  achieving  the  world's  first-ever  zero-carbon production  (scopes  1  and  2)  of  flat  glass  in  2022, Saint-Gobain  delivered  another  world-first  in  March 2023,  producing  glass  with  a  furnace  powered  by over  30%  hydrogen  at  its  Herzogenrath  site  in Germany,  which  will  allow  a  reduction  of  70%  in scope 1 direct CO2 emissions.\n\n<!-- image -->",

These temporary partitions will be removed  and  reused  on  other  sites  in  the  Paris region.\n\n## Renewable Power Purchase Agreements\n\nThe  Group  has  entered  into  renewable  electricity  supply (scope  2)  contracts,  either  with  physical  electricity delivery (Power Purchase Agreement - PPA), or financial contracts  without  physical  delivery,  including  a  cash settlement based on the difference between the contract price  and  the  market  price  (Virtual  Power  Purchase Agreement - VPPA).\n\nSaint-Gobain analyzes the accounting treatment for such agreements  before  they  are  set  up.  They  are  accounted for in accordance with either IFRS 16 for leases, IFRS 9 for financial instruments, or IAS 37 for the own-use exemption (IFRS 9.2.4) or regular purchase agreements.\n\nThe  majority  of  the  contracts  signed  by  the  Group  are PPAs that are considered regular purchase agreements.\n\nThe  Group  has  also  entered  into  four  VPPAs,  which  are financial instruments accounted for under IFRS 9.\n\n\u00cb\n\nThe most material agreements (>200 GWh over the term of the contract) at December 31, 2023 are presented in the table below along with their main characteristics:\n\n| Type   | Location               | Type  of  energy   | Power  (per  year)   |   Start  date | Contract  duration   | Accounting  treatment   |\n|--------|------------------------|--------------------|----------------------|---------------|----------------------|-------------------------|\n| VPPA   | USA  (Blooming  Grove) | Wind               | 460  GWh             |          2020 | 12  years            | IFRS 9  (derivatives)   |\n| VPPA   | USA (Cotton  Bayou)    | Solar              | 452  GWh             |          2024 | 10  years            | IFRS 9  (derivatives)   |\n| VPPA   | USA (Danish  fields)   | Solar              | 224  GWh             |          2024 | 15  years            | IFRS 9  (derivatives)   |\n| VPPA   | Poland                 | Wind               | 180  GWh             |          2025 | 15  years            | IFRS 9  (derivatives)   |\n| PPA    | Spain                  | Mix                | 100  GWh             |          2024 | 10  years            | Purchase  contract      |\n| PPA    | USA  (Chowchilla)      | Solar              | 78  GWh              |          2023 | 15  years            | IFRS 16                 |\n| PPA    | France                 | Solar              | 36  GWh              |          2024 | 15  years            | Purchase  contract      |\n| PPA    | Sweden                 | Solar              | 28  GWh              |          2024 | 10  years            | IFRS 9.2.4              |\n| PPA    | Italy                  | Wind               | 22  GWh              |          2024 | 12  years            | Purchase  contract      |\n| PPA    | Spain                  | Solar              | 18.5  GWh            |          2023 | 12  years            | Purchase  contract      |\n| PPA    | Romania                | Solar              | 12  GWh              |          2023 | 20  years            | Purchase  contract      |\n\nIn  accordance  with  IFRS  9,  VPPAs  are  measured  at  fair value  through  profit  or  loss,  with  the  exception  of  one VPPA qualified as a hedge (Poland VPPA), with changes in fair value recognized  through  other  comprehensive income.\n\nOverall,  the  impact  of  changes  in  fair  value  of  VPPAs  on the Group's 2023 financial statements is not material.\n\nGreen  power  represented  57%  of  the  Group's  electricity purchases in 2023, and this percentage is set to rise once the above agreements take effect in 2024.\n\n## Measuring and tracking scope 3 emissions\n\nThe  scope  3  categories  on  which  the  Group  has  real leverage  and  which  are  subject  to  SBTi  validation  are mainly  upstream  categories  (purchases  of  raw  materials and  trading  products,  energy  purchases  and  transport). The Group is continuing its efforts to improve the quality and quantity of available data using a fine-tuned tool that regularly tracks emissions in the main scope 3 categories. The aim is to build an efficient and automated data model in this area.\n\nIn  the  raw  materials  and  trading  products,  the  Group's main suppliers (the biggest contributors to CO2 emissions) are  now  asked  to  disclose,  via  a  dedicated  portal,  their carbon  footprints  and  goals,  as  presented  at  Supplier Days.\n\nAs  part  of  the  strategic  plan,  each  Region  and  High Performance  Solutions  (HPS)  identified  the  three  most important actions for reducing scope 3 emissions.",

        "page_content": "## Management of CO2 emissions allowances\n\nAt the end of 2023, the Saint-Gobain Group had 3.6 million tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions allowances from the European  Commission.  Accordingly,  it  believes  that  its current  level  of  allowances  will  continue  to  cover  its emissions for at least four years.\n\n## Sustainable investments, research and development expenditure, and other expenditure aimed at combating climate change and protecting the environment\n\nInvestments to reduce CO2 emissions are tracked monthly in  the  Group's  financial  reporting.  To  help  accelerate progress towards carbon-neutral production, \u20ac1 billion has been set aside over the ten years from 2021 to 2030 for capital  expenditure  and  research  and  development.  In 2023,  the  Group  set  aside  \u20ac144  million  in  capital expenditure  (\u20ac128  million  in  2022)  and  \u20ac79  million  in research  and  development  expenditure  (\u20ac63  million  in 2022)  to  support  further  its  CO2  emissions  reduction strategy.\n\n## Financing activities\n\nFollowing the launch of a bond issue in 2022 featuring a 10-year  \u20ac500  million  tranche  indexed  to  two  2030 sustainability  performance  targets  (a  33%  reduction  in scopes  1  and  2  CO2  emissions  and  an  80%  reduction  in non-recovered  production  waste),  the  Group  signed  a \u20ac4 billion Sustainability-Linked Loan with a pool of banks in  December  2023,  which  loan  will  mature  in  December 2028. Interest on the loan is indexed to three performance indicators  set  out  in  Saint-Gobain's  2030  sustainability roadmap  compared  to  the  2017  baseline  year:  (i)  a  33% reduction  in  scopes  1  and  2  CO2  emissions  in  absolute terms, (ii) an 80% reduction in non-recovered production waste, and (iii) a frequency rate for workplace accidents at or below 1.5 per million hours worked.\n\n## 3.3 Corporate governance\n\n## CSR committees\n\nA CSR Committee has been in place within the Board of Directors  for  several  years,  as  well  as  within  the  Group Executive  Committee.  One  session  of  the  Executive Committee's  CSR  Committee  in  December  2023  was focused on climate change adaptation.\n\n## Internal carbon price\n\nThe Group has raised its internal carbon prices from \u20ac75 to \u20ac100  per  tonne  of  CO2  for  evaluating  capital expenditure decisions, and from \u20ac150 to \u20ac200 per tonne for evaluating R&D projects. A similar approach has been adopted for major acquisitions, and includes the work that may be required to ensure that the carbon impact of these acquisitions is compatible with Saint-Gobain's roadmap.\n\n## Executive compensation policy\n\nIn stepping up its commitment to carbon neutrality, since 2020  the  Group  has  increased  the  weighting  of  CSR objectives in the criteria determining short- and long-term executive compensation  plans.  CSR  objectives  now\n\n2023 Consolidated Financial Statements\n\ndetermine 20% of amounts paid out under long-term plans (versus  15%  previously),  and  15%  of  annual  variable compensation (5% previously),  while  CO2  objectives  now account  for  10%  of  long-term  plans  and  5%  of  annual variable compensation.\n\n## 3.4 Tests of asset sensitivity to changes in CO 2 prices\n\nAs  indicated  in  the  section  on  asset  impairment  reviews (see note 7.5.4, p.  336),  the  Group  includes  sensitivity  to changes  in  the  price  of  CO2  emissions  allowances  in  its impairment tests.\n\nEven  applying  conservative  assumptions,  the  sensitivity analyses  show  that  no  impairment  would  have  been recognized against the net assets in any group of CGUs, given  the  significant  headroom  observed  for  the  main groups of CGUs.\n\n## 3.5 Climate impact assessment on Group assets\n\nIn 2023, Saint-Gobain conducted a study with an external firm to identify its exposure to physical risks related to the impact  of  climate  change  (floods,  forest  fires,  cyclones, storms, drought and heat stress), as well as earthquakes, on  its  activities.  Exposure  and  vulnerability  to  climate issues was analyzed for assets at over 500 major industrial and logistics sites (covering more than 80% of the Group's sales  and  net  carrying  amount  of  its  assets),  using  three IPCC  scenarios:  SSP1-2.6,  SSP2-4.5  and  SSP5-8.5,  and three  time  horizons:  2030,  2040  and  2050.  This  study enabled the financial  impact  of  risks  linked  to  direct  and indirect damage (business interruption) to be assessed for each site, and for the Group as a whole, after taking into account  the  adaptation  measures  in  place.  The  study found  that  even  in  the  most  extreme  scenario  and adopting the 2050 time horizon, the overall risks identified would, at Group level, represent only insignificant amounts compared  to  the  2023  baseline.  Heat  stress,  floods  and storms  would  represent  the  bulk  of  the  estimated  risks, which would mainly arise not as a result of direct damage but from business interruption. The impact would be more significant  in  Asia  and  India,  while  Europe  would  not  be materially affected.\n\nSaint-Gobain's  knowledge  of  the  existence  of  these sensitivities enables it to build physical and transition risks into  its  long-term  vision  and  strategy,  thereby  fully integrating  climate  change  and  its  impacts  into  its decision-making.\n\nIn parallel with this physical risk assessment for its assets, the Group has begun analyzing the growth opportunities for  its  solutions  resulting  from  the  impact  of  climate change  in  several  regions.  This  analysis  will  continue  in 2024.\n\n## 3.6 Consideration of future changes in regulations\n\nThe  Group  is  continuing  its  impact  assessments  and  its work  on  applying  new  regulations  related  to  climate change and the energy transition.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Balance sheet  and  income  statement  items  relating  to  joint arrangements that meet the definition of joint operations are consolidated line-by-line based on the amount actually contributed by the Group.\n\n## Equity accounting\n\nCompanies  over  which  the  Group  directly  or  indirectly exercises  significant  influence  are  accounted  for  by  the equity method.\n\nThe  Group's  share  of  the  income  of  equity-accounted companies is shown on two separate lines of the income statement.  The  income  of  equity-accounted  companies whose  main  business  activity  is  in  keeping  with  the Group's core operational business is presented in business income  under  \"Share  in  net  income  of  core  business equity-accounted  companies\",  while  the  income  of  other equity-accounted companies is shown under \"Share in net income of non-core business equity-accounted companies\" in pre-tax income.\n\n## 4.1.2 Business combinations\n\n## Step acquisitions and partial disposals\n\nWhen the Group acquires  control  of  an  entity  in  which  it already holds an equity interest, the transaction is treated as a step acquisition (an acquisition in stages), as follows: (i) as a disposal of all the previously-held interest, with recognition of any resulting gain or loss in the consolidated financial  statements, and (ii) as an acquisition of all of the shares,  with  recognition  of  the  corresponding  goodwill  on the entire interest (previous and new acquisitions).\n\nIn  the  event  of  a  partial  disposal  resulting  in  the  loss  of control  (but  with  the  Group  retaining  a  non-controlling interest), the transaction is also treated as both a disposal and an acquisition, as follows: (i) as a disposal of the entire interest, with recognition of any resulting gain or loss in the consolidated financial statements, and (ii) as an acquisition of a non-controlling interest, measured at fair value.\n\n## Potential voting rights and share purchase commitments\n\nPotential  voting  rights  conferred  by  call  options  on minority  interests  are  taken  into  account  in  determining whether  the  Group  exclusively  controls  an  entity  only when the Group has control.\n\n\u00cb\n\nWhen  calculating  its  percentage  interest  in  controlled companies,  the  Group  considers  the  impact  of  cross  put and  call  options  on  minority  interests  in  the  companies concerned. This approach gives rise to the recognition in the financial  statements of an investment-related liability, included within other provisions and non-current liabilities, corresponding  to  the  present  value  of  the  estimated exercise  price  of  the  put  option,  with  a  corresponding reduction  in  non-controlling  interests  and  shareholders' equity.  Any  subsequent  changes  in  the  fair  value  of  the liability are recognized by adjusting equity.\n\n## Non-controlling interests\n\nUnder IFRS 10, non-controlling interests are considered as a shareholder category (single economic entity approach). As a result,  changes  in  minority  interests  with  no  loss  of control  continue  to  be  recorded  in  the  statement  of changes  in  equity  and  have  no  impact  on  the  income statement  or  balance  sheet,  except  for  changes  in  cash and cash equivalents.\n\n## 4.1.3 Non-current assets and liabilities held for sale - Discontinued operations\n\nAssets  and  liabilities  that  are  immediately  available  for sale, and for which a sale is highly probable within the next 12  months,  are  classified  as  non-current  assets  and liabilities  held  for  sale.  When  several  assets  are  held  for sale  in  a  single  transaction,  they  are  accounted  for  as  a disposal  group,  which  also  includes  any  liabilities  directly associated  with  those  assets.  Depreciation/amortization ceases when non-current assets are classified as held for sale.  Non-current  assets  and  liabilities  held  for  sale  are presented  separately  on  two  lines  of  the  consolidated balance  sheet,  and  income  and  expenses  continue  to  be recognized  in  the  consolidated  income  statement  on  a line-by-line basis. The reclassified assets are carried at the lower of their fair value less costs to sell and their carrying amount. At the end of each reporting period, the value of the  assets  and  liabilities  held  for  sale  is  reviewed  to determine  whether  any  provision  adjustments  should  be recorded due to a change in their fair value less costs to sell.\n\nAn  operation  is  classified  as  discontinued  when  it represents a separate major line of business for the Group, and when the criteria for classification as an asset held for sale have been met, or when the Group has sold the asset. Discontinued  operations  are  reported  on  a  single  line  in the  Group's  income statement. This line shows the aftertax net income from discontinued operations until the date of disposal and the gains or losses net of taxes realized on the  disposals  of  these  operations.  In  addition,  cash  flows generated by the discontinued operations are reported, by type  of  operation,  on  a  separate  line  in  the  consolidated statement of cash flows for the relevant periods.",

        "page_content": "## 4.1.4 Intragroup transactions\n\nAll  intragroup  transactions  in  the  balance  sheet  and income statement are eliminated in consolidation.\n\n## 4.1.5 Translation of the financial statements of foreign companies\n\nThe  consolidated  financial  statements  are  presented  in euros,  which  is  Compagnie  de  Saint-Gobain's  functional and presentation currency.\n\nAssets and liabilities of subsidiaries outside the Eurozone are  translated  into  euros  at  the  closing  exchange  rate, while income and expense items are translated using the average exchange rate for the period.\n\nThe  Group's  share  of  any  translation  gains  or  losses  is included in equity under \"Cumulative translation adjustments\"  until  the  assets  or  liabilities  and  all  foreign operations  to  which  they  relate  are  sold,  liquidated  or deconsolidated.  In  this  case,  these  translation  differences are either taken to the income statement, if the transaction results  in  a  loss  of  control,  or  recognized  directly  in  the statement of changes in equity, if the change in minority interests does not result in a loss of control.\n\n## 4.1.6 Foreign currency transactions\n\nExpenses and income from operations in currencies other than the Company's functional currency are translated at the  exchange  rates  prevailing  at  the  transaction  date. Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the closing rate and  any  exchange differences are recorded  in  the  income  statement. However,  exchange  differences  relating  to  loans  and borrowings  between  consolidated  Group  companies  are recorded  in  equity,  net  of  tax,  under  \"Cumulative translation  adjustments\",  as  they  are  in  substance  an integral part of the net investment in a foreign subsidiary.\n\n## 4.1.7 Hyperinflation\n\nUnder  IAS  29,  \"Financial  Reporting  in  Hyperinflationary Economies\",  financial  statements  prepared  based  on historical  cost  must  be  restated.  This  involves  applying  a general  price  index  that  enables  the  financial  statements to  be  presented  in  the  measuring  unit  in  force  at  the reporting date. All non-monetary assets and liabilities must therefore  be  adjusted  for  inflation  in  order  to  reflect changes  in  purchasing  power  at  the  reporting  date. Similarly,  the  income  statement  is  adjusted  for  inflation during  the  period.  Monetary  items  do  not  need  to  be restated  as  they  already  reflect  purchasing  power  at  the reporting date.\n\n## Argentina\n\nArgentina  has  been  classified  as  a  hyperinflationary economy  since  July  1,  2018.  IAS  29  therefore  applies  to entities  using  the  Argentine  peso  as  their  functional currency  (based  on  the  table  of  indices  issued  by FACPCE).\n\n## Lebanon\n\nLebanon  has  been  classified  as  a  hyperinflationary economy  since  October  2020.  As  from  December  31, 2020, IAS 29 is therefore applicable to entities using the Lebanese pound as their functional currency.\n\n2023 Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nThe Group's exposure to Lebanon is not material, as sales and total non-current assets in the country represent less than 0.5% of the Group's consolidated data.\n\n## Turkey\n\nSince  February  2022,  Turkey  has  had  a  three-year cumulative  inflation  rate  above  100%  and  was  therefore included in the list of hyperinflationary economies in March 2022. The Group applied the rules for financial reporting in hyperinflationary  economies  to  Turkey  in  its  financial statements at December 31, 2023.\n\n## 4.2  Changes in Group structure\n\nSignificant  changes  in  the  Group's  structure  during  2023 and  2022  are  presented  below  and  a  list  of  the  main consolidated companies at December 31, 2023 is provided in note 15, p. 358.\n\n## 4.2.1 Transactions carried out in 2023\n\nIn 2023, Saint-Gobain acquired 25 consolidated companies for a total purchase price of \u20ac1,254 million. The Group also sold  7  consolidated  companies  for  a  net  sale  price  of \u20ac38 million.\n\n## Main acquisitions in 2023\n\nAcquisitions  represented  full-year  sales  of  \u20ac528  million and EBITDA of \u20ac146 million.\n\n- \u00b7 On  January  30,  2023,  Saint-Gobain  completed  the acquisition of Termica San Luis, a leader in stone wool in Argentina. Termica San Luis is a family-run business with  over  70  years'  experience  in  insulation.  It  is  the leading  producer  of  stone  wool  in  Argentina,  having pioneered its production in the country. The acquisition strengthens  Saint-Gobain's  presence  in  the  insulation market, enhancing its range of solutions for customers thanks to the combination of its position in glass wool insulation with that of Termica San Luis in stone wool;\n- \u00b7 On  February  7,  2023,  Saint-Gobain  completed  the acquisition  of  IDP  Chemicals,  a  Chryso  brand  licensee since  2018.  This  entity  is  well  positioned  to  serve  the dynamic construction market in Egypt and the Group's aim is  to  create  an  admixture  platform  and  eventually group together production facilities and storage space covering  the  needs  of  SG  Weber,  IDPC  &  GCP  in Africa's largest cement market;\n- \u00b7 On March 16, 2023, Saint-Gobain and Dalsan obtained the necessary approval from the competition authorities  to  merge  their  plaster  and  plasterboard activities  in  Turkey.  Once  the  capital  expenditure project  at  the  new  plant  in  Turgutlu  (near  Izmir)  is completed,  the  merged  entity  will  benefit  from  a leadership  position,  combined  know-how,  an  enlarged production capacity and an optimized modern industrial  footprint  in  plasterboard  and  plaster.  Its customers, both those in Turkey and export customers with  growing  needs  in  the  Eastern  Mediterranean,  will have  access  to  the  most  innovative  and  complete portfolio  of  light  and  sustainable  solutions  for  the construction  and  renovation  of  building  envelopes  as well as internal partitioning;\n\n<!-- image -->",

Twiga Fiberglass Ltd (UP Twiga), the leader  in  the  glass  wool  insulation  market  in  India,  as announced  on  February  22,  2023.  The  acquisition consolidates  Saint-Gobain's  positioning  in  interior  and fa\u00e7ade  solutions  in  India,  set  to  benefit  from  higher building  performance  requirements  and  the  strong need  for  acoustic  and  thermal  comfort  as  well  as energy-efficient solutions;\n- \u00b7 On  June  26,  2023,  Saint-Gobain  completed  the acquisition  of  United  Paints  and  Chemicals  S.A.E. ('Drymix'),  a  ready-mix  mortars  manufacturer  serving the  construction  industry  in  Egypt.  This  acquisition accelerates  Saint-Gobain's  growth  in  the  country  by enhancing the range of solutions offered across glass, gypsum  and  construction  chemicals.  It  follows  the recent inauguration of a Saint-Gobain plant producing technical  mortars  (adhesive  and  waterproofing)  in Egypt  and  the  acquisition  of  IDP  Chemicals  in admixtures at the beginning of 2023;\n- \u00b7 On  September  1,  2023,  Saint-Gobain  completed  the acquisition  of  Building  Products  of  Canada  Corp.

These activities, comprising the Vinhedo site in Brazil  and  the  Latrobe  site  in  the  United  States,  were sold  to  the  Japanese  group  Shinagawa  Refractories Corporation.\n\nIn 2022, acquisitions represented full-year sales of around \u20ac1,866 million  and  EBITDA of around \u20ac300 million, while disposals represented full-year sales of \u20ac1,043 million.\n\n## 4.3  Assets and liabilities held for sale\n\nSince the merchanting brands in the United Kingdom were sold in the first quarter of 2023, assets and liabilities held for  sale  at  December  31,  2023  no  longer  include  these entities.\n\nAssets  and  liabilities  held  for  sale  at  December  31,  2023 include:\n\n- \u00b7 PDM in Ireland and Calders & Grandidge in the United Kingdom;\n- \u00b7 Distribution  companies  in  Brazil,  following  the  Group's decision  to  put  its  building  materials  distribution activities in the country up for sale.\n\nThese  disposals  are  part  of  Saint-Gobain's  portfolio optimization  strategy,  which  is  designed  to  improve  the Group's growth and profitability profile.\n\nSince  the  assets  and  liabilities  held  for  sale  meet  the qualifying criteria (see note 4.1.3, p. 310), the balance sheet items  of  these  entities  were  combined  and  measured within assets and liabilities held for sale in the consolidated balance  sheet  at  December  31,  2023,  in  accordance  with IFRS 5.\n\nThese  entities  in  the  process  of  being  sold  were  not considered as discontinued operations within the meaning of IFRS 5 as they do not represent a major line of business for the Group.\n\nAssets and liabilities held for sale break down as follows:\n\n| (in EUR millions)                                                                                   |   Dec. 31, 2023 | Dec. 31, 2022   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n| Intangible assets, property, plant and equipment, right-of-use assets and other  non-current assets |              68 | 529             |\n| Inventories, trade accounts receivable and other receivables                                        |             125 | 851             |\n| Cash and cash equivalents                                                                           |              53 | 14              |\n| ASSETS HELD FOR SALE                                                                                |             246 | 1,394           |\n| Provisions for pensions and other employee benefits                                                 |               0 | (1)             |\n| Other current and non-current liabilities and provisions                                            |              13 | 50              |\n| Trade accounts payable, other payables and other current liabilities                                |             114 | 603             |\n| Debt and bank overdrafts                                                                            |              76 | 333             |\n| LIABILITIES HELD FOR SALE                                                                           |             203 | 985             |\n| NET ASSETS (LIABILITIES) HELD FOR SALE                                                              |              43 | 409             |",

Revenue generated by the sale of goods is primarily recognized at the time the goods are delivered. Revenue generated by the sale of services is recognized when the  services  have  been  rendered,  or  based  on  the stage  of  completion  of  the  services,  as  calculated  based on costs incurred. Similarly, within the Distribution entities, estimated  returns  are  recognized  as  a  deduction  from revenue (sales) and reclassified within inventories for their net carrying amount, since there is a possibility that goods will  be  returned  within  the  allotted  timeframe.  A  liability relating  to  future  refunds  for  goods  returned  is  also recognized.\n\nRevenue  generated  under  construction  contracts  is accounted for by the Group's companies on a percentageof-completion basis, as calculated based on costs incurred. The  related  costs  are  expensed  as  incurred.  When  the outcome of a construction contract cannot be estimated reliably,  contract  revenue  is  recognized  to  the  extent  of contract  costs  incurred  that  it  is  probable  will  be recovered.  When  it  is  probable  that  total  contract  costs will  exceed  total  contract  revenue,  the  expected  loss  is recognized as an expense immediately.\n\nConstruction contract revenues are not material in relation to total consolidated sales.\n\n## 5.1.2 Operating income\n\nOperating income is a measure of the performance of the Group's  different  reporting  segments  and  has  been  used by the Group as its key external and internal management indicator  for  many  years.  Foreign  exchange  gains  and losses are included in operating income, as are changes in the  fair  value  of  financial  instruments  that  do  not  qualify for hedge accounting when they relate to operating items. The  share  of  income  of  core  business  equity-accounted companies is also posted under operating income.\n\nSupplier  discounts  granted  to  entities  in  the  Distribution business are included in operating income as a reduction of  cost  of  sales.  Contractual  supplier  discounts  are customary  practice  in  the  industrial  goods  distribution sector. These discounts are mostly calculated by applying a  contractually  guaranteed  rate  by  product  type  to volumes purchased. The calculation is made automatically, based  on  the  supplier  invoices.  Consequently,  little judgment is needed when determining the amounts to be recognized  in  the  income  statement  for  these  discounts. Other discounts are calculated based on a step mechanism  linked  to  specified  targets,  whereby  the percentage discount increases as the entity achieves the various targets over a given period. In this case, judgment is required based on historical data, past performance and future  trends  in  order  to  determine  the  discount  to  be\n\n\u00cb\n\nrecognized  in  the  income  statement.  Such  judgment  is exercised in a prudent manner and consistently from one period to the next.\n\n## 5.1.3 Business income\n\nBusiness  income  includes  all  income  and  expenses  other than  financial  income  and  expense,  the  Group's  share  in net income  of  non-core  business  equity-accounted companies, and income taxes.\n\nBusiness income is detailed by type below:\n\n| (in EUR millions)                                                                                                 | 2023     | 2022     |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|----------|\n| SALES                                                                                                             | 47,944   | 51,197   |\n| Personnel expenses:                                                                                               |          |          |\n| Salaries and payroll taxes                                                                                        | (8,902)  | (8,995)  |\n| Share-based payments  (1)                                                                                         | (62)     | (43)     |\n| Pensions and employee  benefit obligations  (1)                                                                   | (142)    | (189)    |\n| Depreciation and amortization  of property, plant and  equipment, intangible assets  and right-of-use assets  (2) | (1,986)  | (2,048)  |\n| Share in net income of core  business equity-accounted  companies                                                 | 80       | 61       |\n| Other  (3)                                                                                                        | (31,681) | (34,646) |\n| OPERATING INCOME                                                                                                  | 5,251    | 5,337    |\n| Other business income                                                                                             | 68       | 245      |\n| Other business expense  (2)                                                                                       | (1,088)  | (1,000)  |\n| OTHER BUSINESS INCOME  AND EXPENSE                                                                                | (1,020)  | (755)    |\n| BUSINESS INCOME (EXPENSE)                                                                                         | 4,231    | 4,582    |\n\n- (1) Share-based payments (IFRS 2 expense) and changes in employee benefit expenses are detailed in note 6, p. 322;\n- (2) Total depreciation  and  amortization  of  property,  plant  and equipment,  intangible  assets  and  right-of-use  assets,  along  with amortization charged against intangible assets within the scope of purchase  price  accounting,  represented  \u20ac2,167  million  in  2023 versus \u20ac2,164 million in 2022;\n- (3) The \"Other\" operating income line relates to cost of sales, supplier discounts  and  selling  expenses  for  Distribution  entities,  and  to transport costs, raw materials costs, and other production costs for the other entities.

The cost of inventories includes purchase costs  (net  of  supplier  discounts),  processing  costs  and other  costs  incurred  in  bringing  the  inventories  to  their present location and condition. Cost is generally determined using the weighted-average cost method, and in some  cases  the  First-In-First-Out  (FIFO)  method. Inventory costs may also include the transfer from equity of  any  gains/losses  on  qualifying  cash  flow  hedges  of foreign currency purchases of raw materials. Net realizable value is the selling price in the ordinary course of business, less estimated completion and selling costs. No account is taken in the inventory valuation process of the impact of below-normal capacity utilization rates.\n\nAt  December  31,  2023  and  2022,  inventories  were  as follows:\n\n| (in EUR millions)                | Dec. 31,  2023   | Dec. 31,  2022   |\n|----------------------------------|------------------|------------------|\n| Gross value                      |                  |                  |\n| Raw materials                    | 2,015            | 2,152            |\n| Work in progress                 | 475              | 446              |\n| Finished goods                   | 5,054            | 5,246            |\n| GROSS INVENTORIES                | 7,544            | 7,844            |\n| Provisions for impairment        |                  |                  |\n| Raw materials                    | (270)            | (233)            |\n| Work in progress                 | (19)             | (17)             |\n| Finished goods                   | (442)            | (375)            |\n| TOTAL PROVISIONS FOR  IMPAIRMENT | (731)            | (625)            |\n| INVENTORIES, NET                 | 6,813            | 7,219            |\n\n\u00cb\n\nThe  net  value  of  inventories  was  \u20ac6,813  million  at December  31,  2023  compared  with  \u20ac7,219  million  at December  31,  2022.  Impairment  losses  on  inventories recorded  in  the  2023  income  statement  totaled  \u20ac372 million  (2022:  \u20ac332  million).  Reversals  of  impairment losses  on  inventories  amounted  to  \u20ac260  million  in  2023 (\u20ac222 million in 2022).\n\n## 5.4.2 Operating and non-operating receivables and payables\n\nTrade  accounts  receivable  and  payable  and  other receivables  and  payables  are  stated  at  their  carrying amount,  which  approximates  their  fair  value  as  they generally  have  maturities  of  less  than  three  months. Provisions for impairment are booked to cover the risk of total or partial non-recovery, within the limit of expected credit losses.\n\nThe Group deems that its exposure to concentrations of credit risk is limited due to its diversified business line-up, broad customer base and global presence. Past-due trade receivables  are  regularly  monitored  and  analyzed,  and impairment losses recognized are adjusted where appropriate.\n\nThe  Group  has  various  securitization  and  factoring programs for its trade receivables. Receivables transferred under some of these programs continue to be shown on the  balance  sheet  with  a  corresponding  liability  in  shortterm  debt  if,  based  on  an  analysis  of  the  contracts,  the risks associated with the receivables are not transferred in substance to the financing institutions (further information is provided in notes 10.3.8, p. 348 and 10.3.9, p. 348).\n\n## Trade and other accounts receivable\n\nTrade and other accounts receivable can be analyzed as follows:\n\n| (in EUR millions)                                            | Dec. 31,  2023   | Dec. 31,  2022   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|------------------|\n| Gross value                                                  | 5,538            | 5,597            |\n| Provisions for impairment                                    | (442)            | (419)            |\n| TRADE ACCOUNTS  RECEIVABLE, NET                              | 5,096            | 5,178            |\n| Discounts obtained from and  advances granted to suppliers   | 472              | 529              |\n| Prepaid payroll taxes                                        | 32               | 32               |\n| Other prepaid and recoverable  taxes (other than income tax) | 477              | 484              |\n| Miscellaneous operating  receivables                         | 340              | 299              |\n| Other non-operating receivables                              | 72               | 113              |\n| Provision for impairment of other  receivables               | (7)              | (7)              |\n| OTHER RECEIVABLES, NET                                       | 1,386            | 1,450            |\n\nReceivables at December 31, 2023 were stable compared to end-2022.\n\nThe  impact  of  movements  in  provisions  and  bad  debt write-offs represented an expense of \u20ac90 million in 2023, versus an expense of \u20ac119 million 2022.\n\nBad debt write-offs  were  up  slightly  to  \u20ac59  million  from \u20ac56 million at end-2022.",

There  are  also  additional pension  obligations  in  certain  Group  companies,  both  in France and in other countries.\n\nThe  Group's  obligation  for  the  payment  of  pensions  and length-of-service awards is determined at the end of the reporting  period  by  independent  actuaries  using  the projected unit credit method (taking into account changes in salaries until retirement) and the economic conditions in each country. This obligation may be financed by pension funds, with a provision recognized in the balance sheet for the unfunded portion.\n\nWhen plan  assets  exceed  the  defined  benefit  obligation, the excess is recognized in other non-current assets under \"Net pension assets\". The asset ceiling corresponds to the maximum future  economic  benefit.  Changes  in  the  asset ceiling are recognized in equity.\n\nActuarial gains and losses result from changes in actuarial assumptions,  experience  adjustments  and  the  difference between the funds' actual and estimated (calculated) rates of return. They are recognized against equity as and when they arise.\n\nThe  interest  cost  of  these  obligations  and  the  return  on the related plan assets are measured by the Group using the discount rate applied to estimate the obligation at the beginning  of  the  period,  and  are  recognized  as  financial income or expense.\n\nThe  Group's  main  defined  benefit  plans  are  described below.\n\nIn France, employees receive length-of-service awards on retirement  based  on  years  of  service  and  the  calculation methods prescribed in the applicable collective bargaining agreements.\n\nFollowing the publication of the June 3, 2023 implementing decree 2023-435, as of September 1, 2023 the retirement age in France is being gradually raised, up to  64  by  2030.  As  a  result,  the  age  used  to  calculate pension obligations was changed. This change is considered to be a plan amendment and represents a gain of \u20ac12 million which was recognized in income in 2023.\n\nIn  addition  to  length-of-service  awards,  there  are  three defined  benefit  plans,  all  of  which  are  final  salary  plans. These plans were closed to new entrants by the companies concerned between 1969 and 1997. Effective March 1, 2012, a  defined  benefit  plan  complying  with  Article  L.137-11  of France's Social Security Code ( Code de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 sociale ) was set up by Compagnie de Saint -Gobain. Pursuant to an order of July 4, 2019 issued in the wake of France's PACTE Law  setting  out  an  action  plan  for  business  growth  and transformation, this plan was closed and any vested rights frozen at December 31, 2019. In 2021, two new plans were set  up  pursuant  to  Article  L.  137-11-2  resulting  from  the PACTE Law, effective January 1, 2020. Under these plans, final payments are made to a third-party insurer who takes on responsibility for the liability.",

        "page_content": "In Germany, retirement plans provide pensions and death and  disability  benefits  for  employees.  These  plans  have been  closed  to  new  entrants  since  1996.  Since  January 1997,  new  employees  have  been  offered  pension  plans based on contributions  financed  jointly  by  employer  and employee.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, retirement plans provide pensions as well as death and permanent disability benefits. These defined  benefit  plans  -  which  are  based  on  employees' average  salaries  over  their  final  years  of  employment  have been closed to new entrants since 2001. In 2021, the legal  structure  of  the  plans  was  altered,  resulting  in  the closure  of  the  Building  Distribution  section  to  future accrual as of January 1, 2022.\n\nIn  the  United  States  and  Canada,  the  Group's  defined benefit plans are final-salary plans. Since January 1, 2001, new employees have been offered a defined contribution plan.\n\nIn the United States and Spain, retired employees receive benefits other than pensions, mainly concerning healthcare.  The  Group's  obligation  under  these  plans  is determined using the actuarial method and is covered by a provision recorded in the balance sheet.\n\nProvisions for other long-term employee benefits cover all other employee benefits. These benefits primarily include\n\n2023 Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nlong-service awards in France, jubilee awards in Germany, deferred  compensation,  provisions  for  social  security benefits  in  the  United  States,  and  termination  benefits  in different countries. The related defined benefit obligation is generally calculated on an actuarial basis using the same rules as for pension obligations. Actuarial gains and losses relating  to  these  benefits  are  recognized  immediately  in the income statement.\n\n## 6.3.2 Actuarial assumptions used to measure defined benefit obligations and plan assets\n\n## Interest rate assumptions\n\nAssumptions related to mortality, employee turnover and future  salary  increases  take  into  account  the  economic conditions specific  to  each  country  and  Group  company. The  discount  rates  are  established  by  region  or  country based on observed bond yields at December 31, 2023.\n\nFor  the  Eurozone  (including  France),  two  discount  rates were calculated for 2023 based on the term of the plans using  a  yield  curve  model  developed  by  consulting  firm Mercer: one rate for plans with a term of 13 years or less and one for plans with a term of over 13 years (2022: one rate for plans with a term of 15 years or less and one for plans with a term of over 15 years).\n\nThe rates used in 2023 for the Group's main plans are the following:\n\n|                  | France            | France           | Eurozone (excluding France)   | Eurozone (excluding France)   | United Kingdom     | United States   |\n|------------------|-------------------|------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|--------------------|-----------------|\n| (in %)           | Short-term  plans | Long-term  plans | Short-term  plans             | Long-term  plans              |                    |                 |\n| Discount rate    | 3.16 %            | 3.20 %           | 3.16 %                        | 3.20 %                        | 4.60 %             | 5.00 %          |\n| Salary increases | 1.90 % to         | 5.50%            | 2.60 % to                     | 3.50%                         | 2.00 % *           | 3.00 %          |\n| Inflation rate   | 2.10%             |                  | 2.10%                         |                               | CPI 2.5% RPI 2.95% | 2.50 %          |\n\nThe rates used in 2022 for the Group's main plans were the following:\n\n|                  | France            | France   | France           | Eurozone (excluding France)   | Eurozone (excluding France)   | United Kingdom   | United States   |\n|------------------|-------------------|----------|------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|------------------|-----------------|\n| (in %)           | Short-term  plans |          | Long-term  plans | Short-term  plans             | Long-term  plans              |                  |                 |\n| Discount rate    | 4.16 %            |          | 4.23 %           | 4.16 %                        | 4.23 %                        | 4.85 %           | 5.20 %          |\n| Salary increases | 1.90 % to         | 5.50%    |                  | 2.70 % to                     | 3.00%                         | 2.00 % *         | 3.00 %          |\n| Inflation rate   | 2.20%             |          | 2.20%            |                               |                               | CPI 2.5%         | 2.50 %          |\n\nAs the above three regions account for substantially all of the  Group's  pension  obligation,  the  revised  actuarial assumption  (in  particular  discount  and  inflation  rates), contributed to an increase in the obligation, and therefore in the provision, in an amount of \u20ac468 million.\n\nThe actual return on plan assets for almost all plans was \u20ac60 million lower than expected, leading to an increase in the provision of the same amount. In addition, a \u20ac9 million decrease in the asset ceiling, mainly affecting Switzerland, generated a decrease in the provision in the same amount.\n\n<!-- image -->",

A 0.5% increase in the inflation rate would lead to an overall increase in defined benefit obligations of around \u20ac240 million.\n\nThe same assumptions concerning mortality, employee turnover and interest rates are used to determine the Group's defined  benefit  obligations  for  other  long-term  employee  benefits.  In  the  United  States,  retirees'  healthcare  costs  are projected to rise between 4.00% and 5.49% per year (under 65 years of age), and between 3.19% and 5.97% per year (older  than  65),  depending  on  the  age  of  the  beneficiary.  A  1-point  increase  in  this  rate  would  lead  to  an  increase  of around \u20ac12 million in the related projected benefit obligation.\n\n## 6.3.3 Breakdown of and changes in pension and other post-employment benefit obligations\n\n## Carrying amount of provisions\n\nProvisions  for  pension  and  other  employee  benefit obligations consist of the following:\n\n| (in EUR millions)                                                              | Dec. 31,  2023   | Dec. 31,  2022   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|------------------|\n| Pension obligations                                                            | 1,286            | 1,110            |\n| Length-of-service awards                                                       | 338              | 290              |\n| Post-employment healthcare  benefits                                           | 204              | 183              |\n| TOTAL PROVISIONS FOR  PENSIONS AND OTHER POST- EMPLOYMENT BENEFIT  OBLIGATIONS | 1,828            | 1,583            |\n| Healthcare benefits                                                            | 30               | 27               |\n| Long-term disability benefits                                                  | 6                | 8                |\n| Other long-term benefits                                                       | 96               | 94               |\n| PROVISIONS FOR PENSIONS AND  OTHER EMPLOYEE BENEFITS                           | 1,960            | 1,712            |\n\nProvisions for all other long-term benefits totaled \u20ac132  million  at  December  31,  2023  (\u20ac129  million  at December 31, 2022).\n\nThe following table shows net obligations under pensions and other post-employment benefit plans, excluding other long-term benefits:\n\n| (in EUR millions)                                                                     | Dec. 31,  2023   | Dec. 31,  2022   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|------------------|\n| Provisions for pensions and other post- employment benefit obligations -

Eligible employees must have completed a  minimum  of  three  months'  service  with  the  Group. Eligible  employees  are  able  to  invest  in  Saint-Gobain shares  at  a  preferential  subscription  price.  These  shares are  held  either  directly  or  through  the  employee  saving plan's mutual funds, depending on local legislation, and are subject  to  a  mandatory  five-  or  ten-year  lock-up,  except following  the  occurrence  of  certain  events.  The  Board  of Directors delegates authorization for setting the subscription  price  to  the  Chief  Executive  Officer  of Compagnie  de  Saint-Gobain.  The  subscription  price corresponds to the average of the opening prices for the Saint-Gobain share on Euronext Paris over the 20 trading days preceding the date of the decision, subject to a 20% discount, in accordance with applicable laws, the Shareholders' Meeting resolutions and the deliberations of the  Board  of  Directors.  The  Group  makes  a  matching contribution  to  amounts  paid  in  by  employees,  which  is expensed in the consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe Group recorded an IFRS 2 expense representing the benefit granted  to  employees,  which  amounted  to \u20ac23.7 million in 2023 (\u20ac9.3 million in 2022).\n\nThe  Saint-Gobain  Group  implemented  a  new  PEG  in  the first  half  of  2023.  As  approved  by  the  Chief  Executive Officer  on  March  13,  2023,  the  reference  price  is  \u20ac55.24 (\u20ac56.48  in  2022),  representing  a  subscription  price  of \u20ac44.19 (\u20ac45.19 in 2022) after a 20% discount.\n\nIn 2023, 4,778,291 new shares with a par value of \u20ac4 were issued  to  employees  under  the  PEG  at  an  average subscription  price  of  \u20ac44.19  (4,916,097  shares  at  an average  price  of  \u20ac45.19  in  2022),  representing  a  share capital increase of \u20ac210 million (\u20ac222 million in 2022), net of transaction fees.\n\n## 6.4.2 Stock option plans\n\nUntil  2018,  Compagnie  de  Saint-Gobain  operated  stock option plans for certain employees.\n\nUnder these plans, the Board of Directors granted options allowing  beneficiaries  to  obtain  Saint-Gobain  shares  at  a price  set,  at  no  discount,  by  reference  to  the  average  of the opening prices for the Saint-Gobain share over the 20 stock  market  trading  days  preceding  the  date  of  the decision by the Board of Directors.\n\nFor  all  of  the  plans,  beneficiaries  must  wait  at  least  four years from the grant date to exercise any options. None of\n\n\u00cb\n\nthe options received may be exercised until this four-year period  has  lapsed.  Options  must  be  exercised  within  10 years of the grant date. Except in specified circumstances, grantees forfeit these options if they leave the Group.\n\nAmong the plans outstanding at December 31, 2023, the 2015,  2016  and  2017  plans  offer  stock  purchase  options. The 2018 plan was classified as a stock subscription option plan  further  to  a  decision  of  the  Board  of  Directors  in 2022, prior to the start of the exercise period.\n\nA performance condition applies for all beneficiaries under current plans.\n\nNo stock option plans have been launched since 2019.\n\nThe  following  table  presents  changes  in  the  number  of outstanding options:\n\n|                                           | \u20ac4 par value  shares   | Average  exercise  price (in EUR)   |\n|-------------------------------------------|------------------------|-------------------------------------|\n| OPTIONS OUTSTANDING  AT DECEMBER 31, 2021 | 551,489                | 38.03                               |\n| Options granted                           | 0                      |                                     |\n| Options exercised                         | (28,977)               | 40.97                               |\n| Options forfeited                         | (36,691)               | 31.71                               |\n| OPTIONS OUTSTANDING  AT DECEMBER 31, 2022 | 485,821                | 38.32                               |\n| Options granted                           | 0                      |                                     |\n| Options exercised                         | (143,670)              | 35.23                               |\n| Options forfeited*                        | (4,536)                | 38.80                               |\n| OPTIONS OUTSTANDING  AT DECEMBER 31, 2023 | 337,615                | 39.62                               |\n\n- * Including 4,536 options that lapsed after the exercise period under the  2013  stock  option  plan  expired  (no  options  lapsed  due  to  the non-fulfillment  of  performance  conditions  or  the  withdrawal  of rights).\n\nThe  cost  of  stock  option  plans  is  calculated  using  the Black & Scholes option pricing model.\n\nThe following inputs were used:\n\n- \u00b7 volatility assumptions  that  take  into  account  the historical  volatility  of  the  share  price  over  a  rolling  10year  period,  as  well  as  implied  volatility  from  traded share options. Periods of extreme share price volatility are disregarded;\n- \u00b7 assumptions relating to the average holding period of options, based on observed behavior of option holders;\n- \u00b7 expected  dividends,  as  estimated  on  the  basis  of historical dividend information dating back to 1988;\n- \u00b7 a  risk-free  interest  rate  corresponding  to  the  yield  on long-term government bonds;\n- \u00b7 the effect of any stock market performance conditions, which is taken into account in the initial measurement of IFRS 2 share-based payment expense.\n\nThe cost calculated using this method is recognized in the income statement over the vesting period of the options, which is a maximum of four years.\n\nUnder IFRS 2, the expense attributable to the amortization of stock options granted under previous plans was zero in 2023 (\u20ac0.1 million in 2022).",

These  plans  are subject to eligibility criteria based on the grantee's period of  service  (service  conditions)  with  the  Group  as  well  as performance criteria (performance conditions), which are described  below.  The  IFRS  2  share-based  payment expense  takes  into  account  these  conditions.  It  is determined  after  deducting  the  present  value  of  the dividends  forfeited  on  the  performance  shares  and  is recognized  over  the  vesting  period,  not  exceeding  four years.\n\nAt  December  31,  2023,  there  were  four  outstanding performance  share  plans,  approved  by  the  Board  of Directors in 2020, 2021, 2022 and on November 23, 2023.\n\nThe expense recorded for these plans in the 2023 income statement amounted to \u20ac38.3 million (2022: \u20ac33.2 million).\n\nAll plans are subject to service and  performance conditions.  The  vesting  period  for  the  shares  awarded under  these  plans  is  four  years  and  the  shares  will  be delivered  under  all  plans  the  fourth  day  after  the  end  of the  vesting  period  for  the  2020,  2021,  2022  and  2023 plans.\n\nThe  table  below  shows  changes  in  the  number  of performance share rights:\n\n|                                                          | Number of  rights   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|\n| NUMBER OF PERFORMANCE SHARE  RIGHTS AT DECEMBER 31, 2021 | 4,920,759           |\n| Performance share rights granted in  November 2022       | 1,232,792           |\n| Shares issued/delivered                                  | (1,076,098)         |\n| Lapsed and canceled rights                               | (141,921)           |\n| NUMBER OF PERFORMANCE SHARE  RIGHTS AT DECEMBER 31, 2022 | 4,935,532           |\n| Performance share rights granted in  November 2023       | 1,268,633           |\n| Shares issued/delivered                                  | (1,159,695)         |\n| Lapsed and canceled rights*                              | (92,075)            |\n| NUMBER OF PERFORMANCE SHARE  RIGHTS AT DECEMBER 31, 2023 | 4,952,395           |\n\n- * Including 92,075 rights that lapsed after they had been withdrawn (no  rights  lapsed  because  the  performance  conditions  had  only been partly met).\n\nThe fair  value  of  the  performance  shares  corresponds  to the  Saint-Gobain  share  price  on  the  grant  date,  less  the value  of  dividends  not  payable  on  the  shares  during  the vesting period. The expense is recognized over the vesting period, which covers a maximum of four years.\n\nThe  following  table  shows  the  expected  dates  when  shares  under  the  four  performance  share  plans  outstanding  at December 31, 2023 will be delivered (except in the case of early release following the grantee's death or disability, along with the service and performance conditions remaining to be fulfilled):\n\n| Grant date        | Number of rights  granted at  inception of the  plan   | Deliveries   | Number of rights at  December 31,   2023*   | Delivery date     | Type of shares   |\n|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|--------------|---------------------------------------------|-------------------|------------------|\n| November 26, 2020 | 1,268,295                                              | 1,100        | 1,267,195                                   | November 29, 2024 | existing         |\n| November 25, 2021 | 1,184,475                                              | 700          | 1,183,775                                   | November 28, 2025 | existing         |\n| November 24, 2022 | 1,232,792                                              |              | 1,232,792                                   | November 27, 2026 | existing         |\n| November 23, 2023 | 1,268,633                                              |              | 1,268,633                                   | November 26, 2027 | existing         |\n| TOTAL             | 4,954,195                                              | 1,800        | 4,952,395                                   |                   |                  |\n\n- * Subject to fulfillment of the service and performance conditions applicable to each plan.\n\n<!-- image -->",

IFRS  allows  a 12-month period after the acquisition date (\"measurement period\")  to  identify  the  assets  and  liabilities  of  the acquired  entity  that  were  not  recognized  in  the  initial accounting  for  the  combination,  and  to  retroactively modify the amounts initially allocated.\n\nThe  final  acquisition  price  (\"consideration  transferred\"  in IFRS  3R),  including,  as  appropriate,  the  estimated  fair value  of  any  earn-out  payments  or  other  deferred consideration  (\"contingent  consideration\"  in  IFRS  3R),  is determined  in  the  12  months  following  the  acquisition. Under  IFRS  3R,  any  adjustments  to  the  acquisition  price beyond this 12-month period are recorded in the income statement.  Directly  attributable  acquisition  costs  are expensed as incurred.\n\nIn  addition,  goodwill  is  recognized  only  at  the  date  that control is achieved. Any subsequent increase in ownership\n\ninterest  (without  change  of  control)  is  recorded  as  a change in equity without adjusting goodwill.\n\nGoodwill is recorded in the consolidated balance sheet as the  difference  between  (i)  the  acquisition-date  fair  value plus  the  amount  of  any  non-controlling  interests  in  the acquiree  -  measured  either  at  fair  value  (full  goodwill method) or at the proportionate interest in the fair value of  the  net  identifiable  assets  acquired  (partial  goodwill method) - and (ii) the net amount of assets and liabilities acquired  at  their  fair  value  at  the  acquisition  date.  The Group generally  applies  the  partial  goodwill  method  and the amount of goodwill calculated under the full goodwill method is not therefore material.\n\nAny excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of  the  Group's  share  of  the  assets  and  liabilities  of  the acquired entity is recorded as goodwill. If the fair value of the  net  assets  acquired  and  liabilities  assumed  exceeds their acquisition cost, this negative difference is recognized  in  the  income  statement  in  the  year  of acquisition.\n\nChanges in goodwill in 2023 and 2022 are detailed below:\n\n| (in EUR millions)                                          | Dec. 31, 2023   | Dec. 31, 2022   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n| At January 1                                               |                 |                 |\n| Gross value                                                | 14,304          | 13,399          |\n| Accumulated impairment                                     | (1,446)         | (2,218)         |\n| NET VALUE                                                  | 12,858          | 11,181          |\n| Changes during the period                                  |                 |                 |\n| Impairment                                                 | (81)            | (28)            |\n| Translation adjustments and restatement for hyperinflation | (162)           | (37)            |\n| Changes in Group structure                                 | 496             | 1,742           |\n| TOTAL CHANGES                                              | 253             | 1,677           |\n| At December 31                                             |                 |                 |\n| Gross value                                                | 14,534          | 14,304          |\n| Accumulated impairment                                     | (1,423)         | (1,446)         |\n| NET VALUE                                                  | 13,111          | 12,858          |\n\nIn  2023,  changes  in  Group  structure  relate  mainly  to  the first-time consolidation of companies  following the acquisition of Building Products of Canada  Corp.

These brands are not amortized but are tested systematically  for  impairment  on  an  annual  basis.  Other brands are amortized over their useful lives, not exceeding 40 years.\n\nCustomer  relationships  are  amortized  over  the  attrition period used to value these assets.\n\nCosts  incurred  to  develop  software  in-house  -  primarily configuration,  programming  and  testing  costs  -  are\n\nrecognized  as  intangible  assets.  Patents  and  purchased computer  software  are  amortized  over  their  estimated useful lives, not exceeding 20 years for patents and three to five years for software.\n\nResearch  costs  are  expensed  as  incurred.  Development costs  meeting  the  recognition  criteria  under  IAS  38  are included  in  intangible  assets  and  amortized  over  their estimated useful lives (not exceeding five years) from the

The  translation  adjustments and restatements for hyperinflation primarily reflected the impacts of fluctuations in the Canadian and US dollars, and in pound sterling.\n\n## 7.3  Property, plant and equipment\n\nLand,  buildings  and  equipment  are  carried  at  historical cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment.\n\nCost  may  also  include  incidental  expenses  directly attributable  to  the  acquisition,  as  well  as  the  impact  of transfers  from  equity  of  any  gains/losses  on  qualifying cash  flow  hedges  of  property,  plant  and  equipment purchases.\n\n2023 Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nExpenses  incurred  in  exploring  and  evaluating  mineral resources  are  included  in  property,  plant  and  equipment when  it  is  probable  that  associated  future  economic benefits  will  flow  to  the  Group.  They  include  mainly  the costs of topographical or geological studies, drilling costs, sampling  costs  and  all  costs  incurred  in  assessing  the technical feasibility and commercial viability of extracting the mineral resource.\n\nMaterial borrowing costs incurred for the construction and acquisition of property, plant and equipment are included in the cost of the related asset if they are significant.\n\nProperty,  plant  and  equipment  are  considered  as  having no  residual  value,  as  they  chiefly  consist  of  industrial assets that are intended to be used until the end of their useful lives.\n\nProperty,  plant  and  equipment  other  than  land  are depreciated  using  the  components  approach  on  a straight-line basis over the following estimated useful lives, which are regularly reviewed:\n\n- \u2022 Major factories and offices\n\n30-40\u00a0years\n\n- \u2022 Other buildings\n\n15-25\u00a0years\n\n- \u2022 Production machinery and equipment\n\n5-16\u00a0years\n\n- \u2022 Vehicles\n\n3-5\u00a0years\n\n- \u2022 Furniture, fixtures, office and computer equipment\n\n4-16\u00a0years\n\nGypsum  quarries  are  depreciated  over  their  estimated useful  lives,  based  on  the  quantity  of  gypsum  extracted during the year compared with extraction capacity.\n\nProvisions  for  site  restoration  are  recognized  as  a component of assets whenever the Group has a legal or constructive obligation to restore a site in accordance with contractually  determined  conditions  or  in  the  event  of  a sudden  deterioration  in  site  conditions.  These  provisions are reviewed periodically and may be discounted over the expected  useful  lives  of  the  assets  concerned.  The component is depreciated over the same useful life as that used for mines and quarries.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## 7.4  Right-of-use assets linked to leases\n\nThe Saint-Gobain Group applies IFRS 16 and restates all of its leases.\n\nThe  following  recognition  exemptions  proposed  by IFRS 16 have been used by the Group:\n\n- \u00b7 leases with a lease term of 12 months or less;\n- \u00b7 leases  where  the  underlying  asset  has  a  value  of  less than US$5,000 when new.\n\n## Property leases\n\nThe lease term corresponds to the non-cancelable period of the lease, plus any renewal (or termination) options that the  Group  is  reasonably  certain  to  exercise  (or  not  to exercise).  The  Group  determined  whether  or  not  lease renewal (or termination) options were reasonably certain to  be  exercised  based  on  the  location  of,  and  any improvements  inseparable  from,  the  leased  asset.  The lease term at inception for \"3/6/9-year\" commercial leases in  France  is  generally  nine  years.  The  Group  did  not identify  any  material  leases  with  similar  characteristics  in other countries.\n\nThe discount rate used to calculate the lease liability is the incremental  borrowing  rate.  This  rate  is  applied  at  the commencement of the lease or at the date of the decision to  renew  the  lease.  The  Group  calculated  the  rate applicable  to  each  lease  contract  on  the  basis  of  its duration,  which  reflects  the  payment  profile  of  the  lease liability.\n\nThe  useful  life  of  non-movable  leasehold  improvements cannot exceed the useful life of the right-of-use assets to which they relate.\n\n2023 Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n## Leases other than property leases\n\nThe main leases identified correspond to leases of vehicles, machinery and production equipment.\n\nThe lease capitalization period (lease term) represents the non-cancelable period of the lease. Where leases provide for a renewal  (or termination) option, the Group determined  whether  or  not  that  option  was  reasonably certain to be exercised based on the ease with which the leased asset could be replaced and its criticality.\n\nThe  discount  rate  used  to  determine  the  lease  liability  is calculated using the same approach as for property leases.\n\nThe  interest  rate  implicit  in  the  lease  is  used  as  the discount rate only in the case of non-property leases and only if this is expressly stipulated in the lease contract.\n\nAlthough  leases  can  generally  incorporate  indexation clauses,  lease  liabilities  are  measured  based  solely  on indexes known at the end of the reporting period.\n\nIn 2023, right-of-use assets linked to leases related mainly to land and buildings for \u20ac2,343 million (\u20ac2,336 million at December 31, 2022) and to machinery and equipment for \u20ac467 million (\u20ac416 million at December 31, 2022).\n\nLease payments made under low-value and/or short-term leases,  along  with  variable  lease  payments  or  lease payments  falling  outside  the  scope  of  IFRS  16,  totaled \u20ac206  million  at  December  31,  2023  (\u20ac195  million  at December 31, 2022).\n\n<!-- image -->",

The  aim  is  to  provide  Saint-Gobain  customers with a multi-product offering on local markets or as part of the  High  Performance  Solutions  (HPS)  business.  These organizational changes led the Group to redefine the basis for  managing  its  industrial  assets:  its  regional  businesses (Industry,  Distribution)  are  now  managed  by  geographic area (Region), while its global businesses within the High Performance Solutions segment are managed by Business Unit.  Its  CGU  organization  was  therefore  also  adapted accordingly,  and  now  corresponds  to  the  level  at  which the  Group's  Chief  Operating  Decision  Maker  reviews operations and makes decisions about resources.\n\nSince  2019,  the  Group  has  gradually  adapted  and streamlined  its  groups  of  CGUs  in  order  to  bring  their structure into line with its new organization (the Flat Glass CGU and the Construction Products groups of CGUs are now  organized  by  Region,  with  no  impact  on  the recoverable  amount  of  these  groups  of  CGUs  given  the significant headroom for each). It has also taken account of the significant changes in Group structure (disposals of Lapeyre,  Distribution  Germany,  Distribution  Netherlands, Distribution  UK  and  Pipe  in  China;  acquisitions  of  Chryso\n\n\u00cb\n\nand  GCP,  leading  to  the  creation  of  a  Construction Chemicals group of CGUs).\n\nIn  order  to  test  for  impairment,  goodwill  is  allocated  to each of the groups of CGUs, which now perfectly reflect the  organization  of  management  and  internal  reporting, and remain at a smaller level than the operating segments as required by IAS 36.\n\nIn  2023,  the  Group  monitored  and  tested  17  groups  of CGUs  following  the  disposal  of  its  UK  Distribution business.\n\nThe  carrying  amounts  of  goodwill  at  December  31,  2023 are as follows by operating segment:\n\n|                               | Goodwill, net   | Goodwill, net   |\n|-------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n| (in EUR billions)             | Dec. 31,  2023  | Dec. 31,  2022  |\n| High Performance Solutions    | 3.0             | 3.2             |\n| Northern Europe               | 4.2             | 4.2             |\n| Southern Europe - ME & Africa | 2.1             | 2.1             |\n| Americas                      | 3.5             | 3.1             |\n| Asia-Pacific                  | 0.3             | 0.3             |\n| TOTAL                         | 13.1            | 12.9            |",

        "page_content": "## 7.5.2 Impairment of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets, goodwill and right-of-use assets: testing approach\n\nThe Group carries out impairment tests on property, plant and  equipment,  right-of-use  assets,  goodwill  and  other intangible  assets  whenever  there  is  any  indication  of impairment. These tests consist of comparing the asset's carrying amount to its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of the asset's fair value less disposal costs and its value in use.\n\nThe Group's main indicator of impairment is a downward trend  in  EBITDA  for  a  group  of  CGUs  of  more  than  10% year-on-year.\n\nActual  and  projected  business  performance  within  each group  of  CGUs  is  therefore  monitored  on  a  very  regular basis  (four  'rolling  forecast'  phases  each  year,  plus  the budget campaign), enabling any downward trends to be identified.  Each  year,  Saint-Gobain  also  verifies  that budgets for the businesses within its groups of CGUs are in line with the business plans used in the most recent DCF tests.\n\nFurthermore,  in  accordance  with  IAS  36,  goodwill  and non-amortizable  brands  are  tested  for  impairment  each year  at  the  level  of  the  groups  of  CGUs  to  which  they relate. Impairment is tested by comparing the net carrying amount of the assets with their recoverable value.\n\nThe tests use a two-tier approach:\n\n## 1. A  first  \"simplified\"  approach  estimates  value  based on EBITDA multiples.\n\nMost of the EBITDA multiples used are taken from external public sources and relate to the stock market valuation of a sample of comparable listed companies as drawn up by the  Strategy  department,  each  representing  one  of  the Group's main business activities.\n\nThe  average  EBITDA  for  each  business  activity  over  the past  three  years  is  multiplied  by  the  associated  multiple taken from the sample. By weighting the proportion that EBITDA for each business activity represents of the total EBITDA  for  the  group  of  CGUs  in  question,  an  EBITDA multiple  is  calculated  for  each  group  of  CGUs.  These market comparable multiples are updated each year.\n\nUse of this first simplified approach can be justified by the significant  headroom  for  all  groups  of  CGUs,  with  the exception of the three groups of CGUs deemed sensitive and discussed specifically in note 7.5.3.\n\nThe multiples used for 2023 and 2022 are as follows:\n\n|                                |   EBITDA multiples |   EBITDA multiples | EBITDA multiples   |\n|--------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|\n| Operating segments             |             2023   |             2022   | Changes            |\n| High Performance  Solutions    |                9.4 |                9   | 0.4                |\n| Northern Europe                |                9.4 |                9.7 | (0.3)              |\n| Southern Europe - ME &  Africa |                7.7 |                6.8 | 0.9                |\n| Americas (Industries)          |                8.9 |                8   | 0.9                |\n| Asia-Pacific                   |                8.6 |                7.4 | 1.2                |\n\nA  sensitivity  analysis  was  performed  by  applying  a  10% discount to each of the EBITDA multiples adopted. Given the significant headroom at end-2023, this change applied to each group of non-sensitive CGUs would not have led to the recognition of any additional impairment.\n\n2023 Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n## 2. A second approach that determine value in use using the  discounted  cash  flow  (DCF)  method.  This approach is used:\n\n- a. when  groups  of  CGUs  are  classified  as  sensitive,  i.e., when their recoverable amount based on the multiples approach is less than or approximates the net carrying amount of the assets,  or  when  groups  of  CGUs  were already  classified  as  sensitive  at  the  end  of  the previous  reporting  period  (Distribution  Brazil,  Pipe Europe and Pipe Latin America at end-2022);\n- b. when there is an indication of impairment; or\n- c. when an event occurs that is likely to significantly alter the Group's organization, business model or one of its businesses/markets.\n\nIn  the  tests  performed  using  the  DCF  approach,  value  in use is calculated using the net present value of future cash flows excluding interest but including tax. It is determined using  assumptions  made  by  management  based  on estimates and judgments including future changes in sales, profitability, investments and other cash flows arising from the  use  of  the  corresponding  assets,  as  well  as  the discount rate applied to future cash flows. This approach projects  the  cash  flows  forecast  in  the  last  year  of  the three-year  business  plan  a  further  two  years,  and  then projects them to perpetuity using an annual growth rate.\n\nDuring  the  impairment  tests  performed  using  the  DCF approach,  different  assumptions  measuring  the  method's sensitivity  are  systematically  tested  using  the  following inputs:\n\n- \u00b7 0.5% increase in the discount rate applied to cash flows;\n- \u00b7 0.5% decrease in the annual average rate of growth in cash flows projected to perpetuity;\n- \u00b7 1-point  decrease  in  the  operating  income  rate  for Industry activities and  a  0.5-point  decrease  for Distribution activities.\n\nWhen  the  annual  impairment  test  reveals  that  the recoverable  amount  of  an  asset  is  less  than  its  carrying amount, an impairment loss is recorded.\n\nImpairment  losses  on  goodwill  can  never  be  reversed through  income.  For  property,  plant  and  equipment  and other intangible  assets,  an  impairment  loss  recognized  in prior  periods  may  be  reversed,  taking  into  account depreciation/amortization  adjustments,  if  there  is  an indication  that  the  impairment  no  longer  exists  and  that the  recoverable  amount  of  the  asset  concerned  exceeds its carrying amount.\n\nAssets and liabilities held for sale are carried at the lower of their fair value less costs to sell and their net carrying amount.\n\n## 7.5.3 Sensitive groups of CGUs\n\nThree CGUs or groups of CGUs were identified as sensitive at the end of December 2023: Distribution Brazil, Pipe Europe and Pipe Latin America.\n\nIn  2023,  the  discount  rates  used  for  sensitive  groups  of CGUs  were  8.0%  for  Pipe  Europe,  12.1%  for  Pipe  Latin America and 14.1% (local currency) for Distribution Brazil. Annual perpetual growth rates in 2023 were 1.5% for Pipe Europe,  1.8%  for  Pipe  Latin  America  and  3.0%  for Distribution Brazil.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\n2023 Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nSales  for  the  Pipe  Europe  group  of  CGUs  in  2023  were stable compared with 2022, with sales up in Italy, virtually unchanged in France and Spain, but down in Northern and Central  Europe  as  many  local  authorities  postponed investment  projects.  This  led  to  the  use  of  furlough schemes  and  a  decline  in  production  from  the  second quarter onwards. The business is expected to be stable in 2024. The operating income rate is expected to improve, spurred by a plan to adapt the organization of production and to optimize overheads.\n\nAt constant exchange rates, 2023 sales for the Pipe Latin America group of CGUs were slightly up on 2022 despite the political transition in Brazil which  slowed  the development  of  new  projects,  driven  by  major  export projects  in  Uruguay,  Panama  and  Peru,  for  example. Operating income excluding non-recurring items and the devaluation of the Argentine peso at the end the year was stable  compared  with  2022.  The  operating  income  rate should improve in 2024 due to planned fixed cost savings.\n\nIt should be noted that a 1.0% increase in the discount rate, combined  with  a  1.0%  decrease  in  the  average  annual growth rate, would not have resulted in the recognition of any  impairment  against  assets  at  the  level  of  the  Pipe Europe and Pipe Latin America groups of CGUs. Similarly, a 1-point decrease in the operating income rate would not have resulted in the recognition of any impairment against assets in the two groups of Pipe CGUs.\n\nAgainst the backdrop of a sharp slowdown in the Brazilian real  estate  market,  sales  for  the  Distribution  Brazil  CGU declined  in  2023  at  constant  exchange  rates.  This downturn in business resulted in an operating loss in 2023, leading  the  Group  to  recognize  impairment  against property,  plant  and  equipment  and  intangible  assets  for \u20ac35 million at the end of 2023.\n\n## 7.5.4 Asset valuation and sensitivity to CO2 prices\n\nThe Group now has highly structured roadmaps on which its  net-zero-emissions  target  is  based.  These  roadmaps consist  of  many  different  action  plans  and  industrial projects (energy efficiency, alternative energies, electrification,  etc.),  detailed  for  each  site  and  aimed  at reducing  scope  1  direct  emissions,  combined  with  a growing  number  of  new  Purchase  Power  Agreements (PPAs) and Virtual Purchase Power Agreements (VPPAs) on a country-by-country basis, designed to reduce scope 2 indirect emissions.\n\nFollowing  a  major  effort  to  improve  the  integrity  and automated process for CO2 data reporting, along with the implementation  of  an  internal  tool  for  calculating,  using and communicating such data, the Group is now able to consolidate  and  analyze  quantitative  changes  in  its  CO2 emissions  on  a  monthly  basis,  as  well  as  the  nature  of these changes.\n\nCO2 data  is  now  an  integral  part  of  the  KPIs  tracked  by each  local  Saint-Gobain  manager  in  the  same  way  as financial  data,  and  is  therefore  included  in  all  of  the Group's forecasting phases (budget and strategic plan).\n\n\u00cb\n\nThese  CO2  roadmaps  are  used  within  the  scope  of  the annual  tests  of  sensitivity  to  changes  in  CO2  prices, conducted in parallel with the annual impairment tests for groups  of  CGUs.  Based  on  information  on  current  CO2 emissions from production sites, and factoring in projections  and  assumptions  as  regards  business  trends and CO2 emissions reductions (scopes 1 and 2), validated by  each  of  the  Regions  and  by  High  Performance Solutions,  a  projection  of  future  CO2  emissions  was determined for each site up to 2030.\n\nThese projections take into account planned investments to:\n\n- \u00b7 Maximize  energy  efficiency  by  exploring  all  energy switching  options  (biofuel,  hydrogen  or  synthetic  fuel, green electricity);\n- \u00b7 Make  products  lighter,  replace  them  with  low-carbon alternatives, increase recycled content and significantly rethink formulations and processes.\n\nFor the European Union scope, the Group has determined projected changes in CO2 emissions up to 2030 as per the roadmaps drawn up for each Region up to 2030, taking into  account  historical  business  levels,  a  factor  reflecting exposure  to  the  risk  of  carbon  leakage  in  a  carbon emissions trading system, and the stock of CO2 emissions allowances  held  at  the  end  of  December  2023.  As expected,  the  Group  takes  into  account  the  gradual reduction  in  free  CO2  emissions  allowances  granted  to industrial sites under the EU Emissions Trading Scheme.\n\nThese CO2 emissions were valued on the basis of a euro price per tonne resulting from a panel of analysts as of the end  of  2023  (source:  Carbon  Market  Pulse  Limited,  an independent private company based in London).\n\n| (in euros/tonne)   |   2024 |   2025 |   2026 |   2027 |   2030 |\n|--------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Analysts average   |     90 |     93 |    112 |    127 |    159 |\n\nFor  the  non-European  scope,  forecast  reductions  in  CO2 emissions as per the roadmaps for each Region were also taken  into  account,  and  tonnes  of  CO2  emitted  were priced  in  the  tests  assuming  a  fixed  price  of  \u20ac100  per tonne as from 2024 and no government support schemes such  as  CO2  emissions  allowances.  This  assumption  of \u20ac100  per  tonne  is  consistent  with  the  application  of  an internal carbon  price  set  by  Saint-Gobain,  and  is conservative in that few countries outside Europe have so far defined a price per tonne of carbon.\n\nThe recoverable amounts of assets determined based on the EBITDA multiples or DCF approaches were impacted by  the  forecast  costs  of  CO2  emissions  -  net  of  the  free emissions  allowances  received  -  projected  to  perpetuity, and  compared  to  the  net  carrying  amount  of  assets  at December  31,  2023  (property,  plant  and  equipment, intangible  assets  and  working  capital).  These  sensitivity analyses,  carried  out  based  on  the  assumptions  set  out above,  would  not  have  led  to  the  recognition  of  any impairment against the net assets in any group of CGUs, given  the  significant  headroom  observed  for  the  main groups of CGUs.",

when  (i)  the  Group  has  a  present legal or constructive obligation towards a third party as a result of a past event, (ii) it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation, and (iii) the amount of the obligation can be estimated reliably.\n\nIf  the  amount  or  due  date  of  the  obligation  cannot  be estimated  reliably,  it  is  classified  as  a  contingent  liability and reported as an off-balance sheet commitment.\n\nProvisions for other material liabilities and charges whose timing  can  be  estimated  reliably  over  the  long  term  are discounted to present value.\n\n## 9.1 Provisions for other liabilities and charges\n\nThe table below provides a breakdown by type along with details of changes in other provisions and current and

These  provisions  are  described  in further  detail  in  note  9.2  \"Contingent  liabilities  and litigation\".\n\n## 9.1.2 Provisions for restructuring costs and personnel expenses\n\nProvisions for restructuring costs and personnel expenses amounted  to  \u20ac235  million  at  December  31,  2023 (December 31, 2022: \u20ac155 million).\n\nThese provisions cover restructuring transactions (personnel costs and other charges linked to reorganization  plans),  as  well  as  provisions  for  personnel expenses  unrelated  to  restructuring  plans,  in  particular provisions for severance payments.\n\n## 9.1.3 Provisions for customer warranties\n\nThese  provisions  cover  the  Group's  commitments  under warranties  granted  to  customers  mainly  in  the  United States. They are determined on a statistical basis using a range  of  criteria  and  take  into  account  contractual warranty  payments  made  in  prior  years  in  the  business and region concerned. In addition, specific provisions may be set aside for identified contingencies in the context of a specific claim.\n\n## 9.1.4 Provisions for other contingencies\n\nAt December 31, 2023, provisions for other contingencies amounted  to  \u20ac715  million  (December  31,  2022:  \u20ac674 million)  and  mainly  concern  the  United  States  (\u20ac469 million), France (\u20ac69 million) and Brazil (\u20ac96 million).\n\n## 9.1.5 Investment-related liabilities\n\nInvestment-related  liabilities  correspond  to  commitments to  purchase  minority  interests,  liabilities  relating  to  the acquisition  of  shares  in  Group  companies,  and  minority shareholder puts.\n\nIn 2023, changes in investment-related liabilities relate to a \u20ac22 million increase in minority shareholder puts, offset by a  \u20ac34  million  decrease  in  liabilities  relating  to  the acquisition of equity interests.\n\n## 9.2  Contingent liabilities and litigation\n\n## 9.2.1 Antitrust law and related proceedings\n\n## Investigation by the Swiss Competition Commission in the sanitary products wholesale industry\n\nIn  November  2011,  the  Swiss  Competition  Commission ( Commission  suisse  de  la  concurrence ) opened  an investigation into anti-competitive practices in the sanitary products wholesale industry. In May 2014, the Commission Secretariat  issued  a  notice  of  complaints  against  Sanitas Troesch and other wholesalers in the industry alleging that Sanitas Troesch and some of its competitors had, among\n\n\u00cb\n\nother  things,  agreed  in  2005  and  2012  to  lower  gross prices.\n\nThe total  fine  imposed  on  all  companies  involved  is  CHF 80 million. For Sanitas Troesch, the fine is CHF 28.8 million. Sanitas Troesch appealed this decision on May 2, 2016 and continues  to  firmly  refute  the  claims  made.  The  hearing took  place  before  the  Federal  Administrative  Court  on January  21,  2020  and  the  date  on  which  the  Federal Administrative  Court  will  issue  its  decision  is  not  yet known. However, a provision for claims and litigation was recognized at December 31, 2015 in an amount equivalent to the fine (unchanged as at December 31, 2023).\n\n## Investigations by Competition Authorities in the additives and admixtures sector\n\nThe European Commission, the Competition and Markets Authority in the UK and the Turkish competition authority have launched investigations into anti-competitive practices in relation to the supply of chemical additives for cement and chemical admixtures for concrete and mortar. As of 31 December 2023, no statement of objections has been issued.\n\nIncidentally, class actions have been instituted against the Group in the United States and Canada in connection with these investigations which remain at a preliminary stage\n\n## 9.2.2 Asbestos-related litigation\n\nCurrent  legal  actions  related  to  asbestos  are  described below.\n\n## Asbestos-related litigation in France\n\n## Inexcusable fault lawsuits\n\nIn France, Everite and Saint -Gobain PAM, which in the past manufactured fiber-cement products containing asbestos fibres, are the subject of actions by former employees of these  companies (or persons claiming through them) for recognition of inexcusable fault following diseases recognized as being of occupational origin.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, a total of 854 lawsuits had been issued  against  the  two  companies  since  the  outset  with the  aim  of  obtaining  supplementary  compensation  over and above the amounts paid by the French Social Security authorities in this respects.\n\nAs of the same date, 839 of these 854 lawsuits had been completed and 15 actions are still pending.\n\nThe  total  amount  of  compensation  paid  by  Everite  and Saint -Gobain PAM since the outset of  these  litigations  in settlement  of  these  lawsuits  totaled  approximately  \u20ac11.5 million as of December 31, 2023 (compared to approximately \u20ac 9.7 million as of December 31, 2022).\n\nIn  addition,  similar  suits  had  been  filed  against  15  French companies of the Group (excluding suits against companies that are no longer part of the Group) which in the  past  used  equipment  containing  asbestos  to  protect their employees  and  installations  against  heat  from furnaces.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, a total of 292 lawsuits had been filed  since  the  outset  against  these  15  companies.  254  of these  292  lawsuits  had  been  completed  and  38  actions were still pending at the same date.\n\nThe total amount of compensation paid since the outset of the  litigations  by  these  companies  was  approximately \u20ac15,2  million  as  of  December  31,  2023  (compared  to approximately \u20ac11,8 million as of December 31, 2022).",

        "page_content": "## Anxiety claims\n\nEight  of  the  Group's  subsidiaries  that  operate  or  have operated  facilities  in  France  classified  as  containing asbestos,  were  the  subject  of  anxiety  claims  brought  by current  or  former  employees  not  suffering  from  an occupational disease due to asbestos -claiming compensation for prejudice of anxiety suffered as a result of their alleged exposure to asbestos.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, a total of 861 lawsuits had been brought against these companies.\n\nAt  the  same  date,  the  lawsuits  have  been  all  definitely completed.\n\nThe total amount of compensation paid since the outset of the  litigations  was  \u20ac8.8  million  as  of  December  31,  2023 (against  approximately  \u20ac8.5  million  as  of  December  31, 2022).\n\nIt  should  be  clarified  that  the  above  figures  do  not  take into  account  suits  filed  against  companies  that  are  no longer part of the Group.\n\nLast, the  total amount  registered  as  provision  for asbestos-related  litigations  in  France  -  inexcusable  faults lawsuits  and  anxiety  claims  -  amounted  to  around \u20ac7 million as of December 31, 2023 (compared to around \u20ac8 million as of December 31, 2022).\n\n## Situation in the United States\n\n## Measures taken to achieve an equitable and permanent resolution of the former CertainTeed Corporation's legacy asbestos liabilities in the United States\n\nDBMP LLC, an affiliate of CertainTeed LLC based in North Carolina,  that  holds  the  legacy  asbestos  liabilities  of  the former  CertainTeed  Corporation,  filed,  on  January  23, 2020, a voluntary petition for relief under Chapter 11 of the US Bankruptcy Code in the US Bankruptcy Court for the Western District of North Carolina in Charlotte. The matter remains pending. The purpose of the filing is to achieve a certain,  final  and  equitable  resolution  of  all  current  and future  claims  arising  from  asbestos-containing  products manufactured  and  sold  by  the  former  CertainTeed Corporation.\n\nDBMP LLC intends to seek court authority to establish a trust under section 524(g) of the US Bankruptcy Code - a specific provision that is applicable to companies that face substantial  numbers  of  asbestos-related  claims  -  to achieve  a  fair  and  equitable  resolution  of  its  asbestosrelated liabilities. Upon establishment of the trust, current and future plaintiffs with qualifying claims will be able to receive  faster  payment  of  their  claims  without  the  delay, stress  and  uncertainty  of  litigation  in  the  tort  system;  at the same time, the creation and funding of such a trust will permanently  and  finally  resolve  DBMP  LLC's  asbestos liability.\n\nDuring  the  course  of  this  bankruptcy  process,  which  is expected to take up to approximately five to eight years, all  asbestos  litigations  have  been  stayed  and  all  related costs suspended, providing DBMP LLC with the time and protection to negotiate an agreement to be approved on behalf of all claimants and by the court.\n\n2023 Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nThis  action  was  taken  as  a  result  of  the  increasing  risks presented in  the  US  tort  system.  Despite  the  passage  of time, the aging of the population and lessening opportunity  for  claimants  to  assert  legitimate  claims  of exposure  to  the  asbestos-containing  products  of  the former  CertainTeed  Corporation,  naming  practices  in  the tort  system  continued  to  result  in  a  steady  volume  of claims against DBMP LLC, with no foreseeable end in sight. In  addition,  there  has  been,  in  general,  an  escalation  of settlement demands and verdicts in the tort system.\n\nCertain adversary  proceedings  have  been  filed  by representatives  of  current  and  future  asbestos  plaintiffs against DBMP  LLC,  CertainTeed  LLC,  Saint -Gobain Corporation,  Compagnie  de  Saint -Gobain  and  various other  parties.  No  decisions  on  the  merits  of  the  claims have  been  made  and  such  claims  do  not  affect  the Company's financial assessment of the Chapter 11 case.\n\n## Impact on the financial statements\n\nFollowing  the  commencement  of  the  proceeding  under Chapter  11  of  the  US  Bankruptcy  Code  on  January  23, 2020,  the  assets  and  liabilities  of  DBMP  LLC  and  its wholly-owned  subsidiary  Millwork  &  Panel  LLC,  and  in particular  the  provision  for  asbestos-related  litigation  in the  United  States,  are  no  longer  consolidated  in  the Group's financial statements.\n\nNonetheless,  because  of  a  funding  agreement  between CertainTeed  LLC  and  DBMP  LLC  by  which  CertainTeed LLC has agreed to fund the costs of the Chapter 11 case and, ultimately, the 524(g) trust, in both cases solely to the extent  DBMP  LLC  is  unable  to  do  so  in  full,  the  Group recorded  in  its  consolidated  financial  statements  a provision  corresponding  to  the  amount  of  the  estimated debt against DBMP LLC amounting to $407 million as of December  31,  2023  ($410  million  as  of  December  31, 2022).The  Group's  consolidated  income  for  2023  is  not impacted by the ongoing Chapter 11 proceeding described above.\n\nAs a result  of  this  bankruptcy  proceeding,  all  legal  costs and indemnity payments related to DBMP LLC's asbestos tort claims have been suspended, and no further charges in  relation  to  such  claims have been taken in 2023 (as in 2022).\n\n## Situation in Brazil\n\nIn Brazil, former employees  of  Brasilit, that once manufactured fiber cement containing asbestos, suffering from  asbestos-related  occupational  illnesses  are  offered, depending  on  the  case,  either  financial  compensation alone  or  lifetime  medical  assistance  combined  with financial compensation. Around 1,200 contractual instruments have accordingly been signed to date.\n\nTwo class actions were initiated against Brasilit in 2017 by two associations defending former employees exposed to asbestos at the S\u00e3o Caetano (S\u00e3o Paulo state) and Recife (Pernambuco  state)  plants,  asking  for  their  medical assistance  and  compensation  to  be  revised.  First  and second  instance  decisions  were  rendered  in  connection with the suit related to the S\u00e3o Caetano plant respectively in  July  2020  and  July  2021,  rejecting  the  claims  of  the plaintiffs. The  latter  have  nevertheless  appealed  the second  instance  decision.  First  and  second  instance decisions  were  rendered  in  relation  to  Recife  case, respectively  in  February  and  October  2022  rejecting  the claiming party arguments. The plaintiff has appealed such second instance decision.\n\nA third class action was initiated against Brasilit in 2019 in Capivari  (State  of  S\u00e3o  Paulo)  by  the  Labor  prosecutor asking  for  health  insurance,  as  well  as  collective  moral damages,  in  favor  of  employees,  former  employees  and their  respective  families,  as  well  as  subcontractors  who\n\n<!-- image -->",

First  and  second  instance decisions were rendered respectively in September 2020 and May 2023 partly in favor of the plaintiffs. In particular, collective  moral  damages  were  granted  to  the  plaintiffs, for  an  amount  reduced  to  BRL  5  million  (\u20ac0.8  million). Brasilit has appealed the second instance decision.\n\nBrasilit is subject to controls by the Ministry of Labor and continues  to  comply  with  all  of  its  legal  obligations  with regard  to  medical  assistance  for  its  current  and  former employees.\n\nIn November 2017, the Supreme Court of Brazil decided to ban  asbestos  definitively  across  the  country.  Brasilit stopped using asbestos voluntarily as early as 2002.\n\n## 9.2.3 Environmental disputes\n\n## PFOA proceedings in the United States\n\nLevels  of  PFOA  (perfluorooctanoic  acid)  in  excess  of  US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) health advisories or  state  maximum  contaminant  levels  for  drinking  water have been found in municipal water systems and private wells near current Saint -Gobain Performance Plastics (SG PPL) facilities in Hoosick Falls (New York) and Merrimack (New  Hampshire),  and  two  former  facilities  in  North Bennington  (Vermont)  in  the  United  States.  PFOA  and PTFE (polytetrafluorethylene) have never been manufactured  by  these  plants.  SG  PPL  is  a  processor  of PTFE  which  it  purchases  from  third  party  suppliers  and which in the past contained some PFOA.\n\nSG PPL has voluntarily provided bottled water in all three communities, installed point-of-entry treatment systems to residents and businesses in all three communities, installed carbon filtration systems on the municipal water supply in Hoosick  Falls  and  funded  the  installation  of  a  carbon filtration system  on  the  Merrimack  Valley  District's municipal  water  supply.  In  addition,  it  has  voluntarily funded  construction  of  water  line  extensions  in  certain communities in the Merrimack and Bennington areas. The investigations are on-going and the scope of responsibility for SG PPL arising from environmental remediation in New Hampshire  and  New  York  and  clean-up  obligations  at these sites has not yet been established. The scope of the remediation in Vermont is defined and largely completed; future  operation  and  maintenance  obligations  remain. Without  admitting  liability,  SG  PPL  has  signed  consent orders  with  the  environmental  regulators  in  New  York  in 2016 and 2023 in Vermont in 2017 and 2019 with respect to  two  different  areas,  and  in  New  Hampshire  in  2018, pursuant  to  which  SG  PPL  has  agreed  to  complete investigations,  implement  interim  or  final  remediation measures  at  its  current  and  former  facilities  and  in  the case of Vermont and New Hampshire, fund construction of water lines. Responsibility, if any, is expected to be shared with other parties as regards in particular the Hoosick Falls site.\n\nPFOA-related  lawsuits  alleging  both  health-related  and economic damages claims have been filed in civil courts in New York, New Hampshire and Vermont, some of which are in the form of class actions. It is difficult to predict the timing or outcome of any such litigation, or whether any additional  litigation  will  be  brought  against  SG  PPL, however,  both  the  New  York  and  Vermont  class  actions are settled.\n\n\u00cb\n\nOn  December  31,  2023,  the  provision  recorded  by  the Company  in  respect  of  this  matter  amounts  to  \u20ac226 million  (compared  to  \u20ac201  million  as  of  December  31, 2012). This provision covers  both  remediation  and litigation related to PFOA matters.\n\n## 9.2.4 Other contingent liabilities\n\n## Grenfell Tower fire in the United Kingdom\n\nCelotex - whose control was transferred by Saint-Gobain Construction  Products  UK  on  January  5,  2024,  provides insulation  materials  for  specific  applications  for  the building  and  construction  industry.  Insulation  materials from two Celotex ranges were purchased via distributors and  used  in  refurbishing  Grenfell  Tower,  London  in 2015/2016, including as one component of the rainscreen cladding system designed and installed (by third parties) on the tower's external facade.\n\nFollowing the Grenfell Tower fire on June 14, 2017, a Public Inquiry  was  constituted  to  consider,  among  other  things, the  modifications  made  to  the  building  as  part  of  the refurbishment, the role played by the various construction professionals,  and  the  information  provided  by  the manufacturers  of  the  products  used.  The  Inquiry's  work was  divided  into  two  phases.  Its  phase  1  report  was published  on  October  30,  2019.  Phase  2  commenced  in January  2020  and  public  hearings  are  complete.  A  final report  is  expected  to  follow  later  this  year.  A  criminal investigation  into  the  circumstances  of  the  fire  is  also  in progress.\n\nThere are a large number of issues and circumstances that need to be explored and the full implications for Celotex Limited  and  Saint-Gobain  Construction  Products  UK Limited are unlikely to be known for some time.\n\nCivil proceedings  in  connection  with  Grenfell  Tower brought  against  Celotex  Limited  and/or  Saint -Gobain Construction Products UK Limited and a number of other defendants  were  issued  by  bereaved,  survivors  and residents and emergency responders.\n\nFollowing confidential alternative dispute resolution processes  involving  a  number  of  parties,  confidential settlements  have  been  concluded  in  relation  to  the majority  of  these  claims  and  resulted  in  payments  to relevant  claimants  without  admission  of  liability.  Celotex Limited  is  continuing  to  engage  with  a  number  of  other defendants in an alternative dispute resolution process to seek  to  resolve  the  remaining  claims  brought  by  the emergency responders. The principal financial implications from the concluded settlements have been paid in full and are reflected in the financial statements as of 31 December 2023.\n\nThe  extent  to  which  Celotex  Limited  and  Saint -Gobain Construction  Products  UK  Limited  may  incur  further financial expenditure  or  civil  or  criminal  liability  in connection with the production, marketing, supply or use of their products is currently unclear and these companies are  currently  unable  to  make  a  reliable  estimate  of  their potential liability in this respect.",

Apart  from  the proceedings and litigation described above, to the best of\n\n2023 Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nthe Company's knowledge, no other government, court or arbitration proceedings exist (including pending proceedings  or  proceedings  where  the  Company  and/or the Group might be threatened) which could have or have had,  in  the  last  12  months,  a  significant  impact  on  the financial  position  or  profitability  of  the  Company  and/or Group.\n\n## NOTE 10 FINANCING AND FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\n\n## 10.1 Financial risks\n\n## 10.1.1 Liquidity risk\n\n## Liquidity risk on financing\n\nIn a crisis environment, the Group might be unable to raise the financing or refinancing needed  to  cover  its investment  plans  on  the  credit  or  capital  markets,  or  to obtain such financing or refinancing on acceptable terms.\n\nThe  Group's  overall  exposure  to  liquidity  risk  on  its  net debt is managed  by  the  Treasury  and  Financing Department  of  Compagnie  de  Saint-Gobain,  the  Group's parent  company.  The  subsidiaries  generally  enter  into shortor long-term financing arrangements with Compagnie  de  Saint-Gobain  or  with  the  regional  cash pools.\n\nThe Group's policy is to ensure that the Group's financing will be rolled over at maturity and to optimize borrowing costs. Long-term debt therefore systematically represents a  high  percentage of overall debt. At the same time, the maturity schedules of long-term debt are set in such a way that  replacement  capital  market  issues  are  spread  over time.\n\nThe  Group's  main  source  of  long-term  financing  is constituted  by  bonds,  which  are  generally  issued  under the  Medium  Term  Notes  program.  The  Group  also  uses lease financing, perpetual bonds, participating securities, a long-term securitization program and bank borrowings.\n\nShort-term  debt  is  composed  of  borrowings  under Negotiable European  Commercial  Paper  (NEU  CP) programs,  and  occasionally  Euro  Commercial  Paper  and US  Commercial  Paper  programs,  but  also  includes receivables securitization programs and bank financing.\n\nThe Group also has factoring programs.\n\nFinancial  assets  comprise  marketable  securities  and  cash and cash equivalents.\n\nCompagnie de Saint Gobain's liquidity position is secured by confirmed syndicated lines of credit.\n\nA  breakdown  of  long-  and  short-term  debt  by  type  and maturity  is  provided  in  note  10.3,  which  also  details  the main  characteristics  of  the  Group's  financing  programs and confirmed credit lines.\n\nSaint-Gobain's  long-term  debt  issues  have  been  rated BBB+  with  a  stable  outlook  by  Standard  &  Poor's  since April 24, 2023, and Baa1 with a stable outlook by Moody's since June 15, 2022.\n\nThere  is  no  guarantee  that  the  Company  will  be  in  a position to maintain its credit risk ratings at current levels.\n\nAny  deterioration  in  the  Group's  credit  risk  rating  could limit  its  capacity  to  raise  funds  and  could  lead  to  higher rates of interest on future borrowings.\n\n## Liquidity risk on investments\n\nShort-term  investments  consist  of  bank  deposits  and mutual  fund  units.  To  reduce  liquidity  and  high  volatility risks,  the  Group  invests  in  money  market  funds  and/or bonds whenever possible.\n\n## 10.1.2 Financial counterparty credit risk\n\nThe Group is exposed to the risk of default by the financial institutions  that  manage  its  cash  or  other  financial instruments, since such default could lead to losses for the Group.\n\nThe  Group  limits  its  exposure  to  risk  of  default  by  its counterparties  by  dealing  solely  with  reputable  financial institutions  and  regularly  monitoring  their  credit  ratings. However, the credit quality of a financial counterparty can change rapidly, and a high credit rating cannot eliminate the risk of a rapid deterioration of its financial position. As a result, the Group's policy in relation to the selection and monitoring  of  its  counterparties  is  unable  to  entirely eliminate exposure to a risk of default.\n\nTo  limit Compagnie  de  Saint-Gobain's  exposure  to counterparty  credit  risk,  the  Treasury  and  Financing Department  deals  primarily  with  counterparties  with  a long-term rating of A- or above from Standard & Poor's or A3 or above from Moody's. Concentrations of credit risk are  also  closely  monitored  to  ensure  that  they  remain  at reasonable  levels,  taking  into  account  the  relative  CDS (\"Credit Default Swap\") level of each counterparty.\n\n## 10.1.3 Market risks\n\n## Energy and commodity risk\n\nThe  Group  is  exposed  to  changes  in  the  price  of  the energy  it  consumes  and  the  raw  materials  used  in  its activities.  Its  energy  and  commodity  hedging  programs may  be  insufficient  to  protect  the  Group  against significant  or  unforeseen  price  swings  that  could  result from the prevailing financial and economic environment.\n\nThe  Group  may  limit  its  exposure  to  energy  price fluctuations by using swaps and options to hedge part of its fuel oil, natural gas and electricity purchases. The swaps and  options  are  mainly  contracted  in  the  functional currency of the entities concerned. Hedges of fuel oil, gas and  electricity  purchases  are  contracted  in  accordance with the Group's purchasing policy.\n\n<!-- image -->",

According  to  Group  policy,  the  derivative  financial instruments  used  to  hedge  interest  rate  risk  can  include interest  rate  swaps,  cross-currency  swaps,  options  including  caps,  floors  and  swaptions  -  and  forward  rate agreements.\n\nThe  table  below  shows  the  sensitivity  at  December  31, 2023 of pre-tax income and pre-tax equity to fluctuations in the interest rate on the Group's net debt after hedging:\n\n| (in EUR millions)                         | Impact on pre-tax income   | Impact on pre-tax equity   |\n|-------------------------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|\n| Interest rate increase of 50 basis points | 33                         | 4                          |\n| Interest rate decrease of 50 basis points | (33)                       | (4)                        |\n\nNote  10.4  provides  a  breakdown  of  instruments  used  to hedge  interest  rate  risk  and  of  gross  debt  by  type  of interest (fixed or variable) after hedging.\n\n## Foreign exchange risk\n\nThe currency hedging policies  described  below  could  be insufficient  to  protect  the  Group  against  unexpected  or sharper  than  expected  fluctuations  in  exchange  rates resulting from economic and financial market conditions.\n\nForeign exchange risks are managed by hedging virtually all transactions entered  into by  Group  entities  in currencies  other  than  the  functional  currency  of  the particular  entity.  Compagnie  de  Saint-Gobain  and  its subsidiaries  may  use  forward  contracts  and  options  to hedge  exposures  arising  from  current  and  forecast transactions.\n\n\u00cb\n\nThe  subsidiaries  generally  set  up  contracts  through  the Group's  parent  company,  Compagnie  de  Saint-Gobain, which  then  carries  out  the  corresponding  forex  hedging transactions on their behalf, or through the regional cash pools. Failing this, contracts are taken out with one of the subsidiary's banks.\n\nMost forward contracts have short maturities of less than one year. However, forward contracts taken out to hedge firm orders may have longer terms.\n\nThe Group monitors its exposure to foreign exchange risk using  a  monthly  reporting  system  that  captures  the foreign  exchange  positions  taken  by  its  subsidiaries.  At December 31, 2023, 96% of the Group's foreign exchange exposure was hedged.\n\nThe residual net foreign exchange exposure of subsidiaries for  the  currencies  presented  below  was  as  follows  at December 31, 2023:\n\n| (in millions of euro equivalent)   |   Long |   Short |\n|------------------------------------|--------|---------|\n| EUR                                |      9 |      12 |\n| USD                                |     23 |      21 |\n| Other currencies                   |      0 |       6 |\n| TOTAL                              |     32 |      39 |\n\nThe  table  below  gives  an  analysis,  as  of  December  31, 2023, of the sensitivity of the Group's pre-tax income to a 10%  increase  in  the  exchange  rates  of  the  following currencies  given  the  subsidiaries'  residual  net  foreign exchange exposure:\n\n| Currency of exposure (in millions of euro equivalent)   | Impact on pre-tax income   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|\n| EUR                                                     | (0.3)                      |\n| USD                                                     | 0.3                        |\n| Other currencies                                        | (0.6)                      |\n| TOTAL                                                   | (0.6)                      |\n\nAssuming that all other variables remained unchanged, a 10%  fall  in  the  exchange  rates  for  these  currencies  at December 31, 2023 would have the opposite impact.\n\nNote  10.4  provides  a  breakdown  of  instruments  used  to hedge foreign exchange risk.\n\n## Saint-Gobain share price risk\n\nThe  Group  is  exposed  to  changes  in  the  Saint-Gobain share  price  as  a  result  of  its  performance  unit  incentive plans. To reduce its exposure to fluctuations in the share price, the Group uses hedging instruments such as equity swaps.\n\nAs a result, if the price of the Saint-Gobain share changes, any  changes  in  the  expense  recorded  in  the  income statement will be fully offset by the hedges in place.\n\nNote  10.4  provides  a  breakdown  of  instruments  used  to hedge share price risk.",

Premiums and issuance costs are amortized using the effective interest rate method.\n\n## Lease liabilities\n\nLease  liabilities  represent  obligations  to  make  lease payments in accordance with IFRS 16.\n\n## Cash and cash equivalents\n\nCash  and  cash  equivalents  mainly  consist  of  bank accounts  and  marketable  securities  that  are  short-term (i.e.,  generally  with  maturities  of  less  than  three  months), highly  liquid  investments  readily  convertible  into  known amounts  of  cash  and  subject  to  an  insignificant  risk  of changes in value.\n\nMarketable  securities  are  measured  at  fair  value  through profit or loss.\n\n<!-- image -->",

This syndicated facility falls due in December 2028, with two further one-year rollover options.\n\nThe  facility  is  a  \"Sustainability-Linked  Loan\"  (SLL)  on which  the  margin  is  indexed  to  three  KPIs  set  out  in Saint -Gobain's sustainable roadmap (reduction of scope 1 and 2 CO2  emissions, reduction in non-recovered production  waste  and  limited  work  accident  frequency rate).\n\nAt December 31, 2023, no drawdowns had been made on this credit facility.\n\n## 10.3.8 Receivables securitization programs\n\nThe  Group  has  set  up  two  receivables  securitization programs,  one  through  its  French  subsidiary  Point.P Finances  GIE,  and  the  other  through  its  US  subsidiary, Saint-Gobain  Receivables  Corporation.  The  receivables sold under the two programs are not deconsolidated.\n\nThe  French  program,  covering  an  amount  of  up  to \u20ac500 million, represented \u20ac500 million at both December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022.\n\n\u00cb\n\nBased  on  observed  seasonal  fluctuations  in  receivables included  in  the  program  and  on  the  contract's  features, \u20ac390  million  of  this  amount  is  classified  as  non-current and the remaining balance as current.\n\nUnder  the  US  program,  covering  an  amount  of  up  to USD 500 million since July 2023, a total of USD 253 million had  been  used  at  December  31,  2023,  representing  the equivalent of \u20ac229 million compared with \u20ac148 million at December 31, 2022.\n\n## 10.3.9 Factoring\n\nThe Group has set up several trade receivables factoring programs. Based on an analysis of the risks and rewards as defined by IFRS 9, the Group has deconsolidated all of the receivables  sold  under  these  programs.  A  total  of  \u20ac646 million  in  factored  receivables  was  deconsolidated  at December  31,  2023,  compared  to  \u20ac644  million  at December 31, 2022.",

        "page_content": "## 10.4  Financial instruments\n\nThe  Group  uses  interest  rate,  foreign  exchange,  energy, commodity and equity derivatives to hedge its exposure to  changes in  interest  rates,  exchange  rates,  and  energy, commodity and equity prices that may arise in the normal course of business.\n\nIn accordance with IAS 32 and IFRS 9, all such instruments are recognized in the balance sheet and measured at fair value,  irrespective  of  whether  or  not  they  are  part  of  a hedging  relationship  that  qualifies  for  hedge  accounting under IFRS 9.\n\nChanges  in  the  fair  value  of  both  derivatives  that  are designated  and  qualified  as  fair  value  hedges  and derivatives  that  do  not  qualify  for  hedge  accounting during  the  period  are  taken  to  the  income  statement  (in business  income  and  expense  for  operational  foreign exchange  derivatives  and  commodity  derivatives  not qualifying  for  hedge  accounting,  and  in  financial  income and  expense  for  all  other  derivatives).  However,  in  the case  of  derivatives  that  qualify  as  cash  flow  hedges,  the effective portion of the gain or loss arising from changes in fair  value  is  recognized  directly  in  equity,  and  only  the ineffective portion is recognized in the income statement.\n\n## Fair value hedges\n\nFair  value  hedge  accounting  is  applied  by  the  Group mainly  for  derivative  instruments  which  swap  fixed  rates against  variable  rates  (fixed-for-floating  interest  rate swaps). These derivatives hedge fixed-rate debt exposed to a fair value risk. In accordance with hedge accounting principles, debt included in a designated fair value hedging relationship is remeasured at fair value to the extent of the risk hedged. As the loss or gain on the underlying hedged item offsets the effective portion of the gain or loss on the fair  value  hedge,  the  income  statement  is  only  impacted by the ineffective portion of the hedge.\n\n2023 Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n## Cash flow hedges\n\nCash  flow  hedge  accounting  is  applied  by  the  Group mainly  for  derivative  instruments  which  fix  the  cost  of future investments (financial assets or property, plant and equipment) and the price of future purchases, mostly gas and  fuel  oil  (commodity  swaps)  or  foreign  currencies (foreign  exchange  forwards).  Transactions  hedged  by these  instruments  are  qualified  as  highly  probable.  The application  of  cash  flow  hedge  accounting  allows  the Group to defer the impact on the income statement of the effective  portion  of  changes  in  the  fair  value  of  these derivatives  by  recording  them  in  a  hedging  reserve  in equity. This reserve is reclassified to the income statement when the hedged transaction occurs and the hedged item itself  affects  income.  In  the  same  way  as  for  fair  value hedges, cash flow hedging limits the Group's exposure to changes  in  the  fair  value  of  these  derivatives  to  the ineffective portion of the hedge.\n\n## Derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting\n\nChanges in the fair value of derivatives that do not qualify for  hedge  accounting  are  recognized  in  the  income statement.  The  instruments  concerned  are  primarily foreign exchange swaps and foreign exchange forwards.\n\n## Fair value of financial instruments\n\nThe  fair  value  of  financial  assets  and  financial  liabilities corresponds to their quoted price on an active market (if any):  this  represents  level  1  in  the  fair  value  hierarchy defined in IFRS 7 and IFRS 13. The fair value of instruments not  quoted  in  an  active  market,  such  as  derivatives  or financial  assets  and  liabilities,  is  determined  by  reference to  commonly  used  valuation  techniques  such  as  the  fair value  of  another  recent  and  similar  transaction,  or discounted cash flow analysis based on observable market inputs.  This  represents  level  2  in  the  fair  value  hierarchy defined in IFRS 7 and IFRS 13.\n\nThe fair value of short-term financial assets and liabilities is considered  as  being  the  same  as  their  carrying  amount due to their short maturities.\n\nThe following table presents a breakdown of the main derivatives used by the Group:\n\n|                                                                                                             | Fair value                     | Fair value                          | Fair value     | Fair value     | Nominal amount by maturity   | Nominal amount by maturity   | Nominal amount by maturity   | Nominal amount by maturity   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------|----------------|----------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|\n| (in EUR millions)                                                                                           | Derivatives recorded in assets | Derivatives recorded in liabilities | Dec. 31,  2023 | Dec. 31,  2022 | Within 1 year                | 1 to 5 years                 | Beyond 5 years               | Dec. 31,  2023               |\n| FAIR VALUE HEDGES                                                                                           | 0                              | 0                                   | 0              | 0              |                              |                              |                              | 0                            |\n| Cash flow hedges                                                                                            |                                |                                     |                |                |                              |                              |                              |                              |\n| Currency                                                                                                    | 2                              | (2)                                 | 0              | (4)            | 214                          | 17                           | 0                            | 231                          |\n| Interest rate                                                                                               | 3                              | (42)                                | (39)           | (41)           | 95                           | 0                            | 368                          | 463                          |\n| Energy and commodities                                                                                      | 0                              | (12)                                | (12)           | 4              | 40                           | 4                            | 0                            | 44                           |\n| Other risks: equities                                                                                       | 5                              | 0                                   | 5              | 1              | 5                            | 6                            | 0                            | 11                           |\n| CASH FLOW HEDGES -

Deferred  tax  assets  and  liabilities  are  measured  at the  tax  rates  expected  to  apply  to  the  period  when  the asset  is  realized  or  the  liability  settled,  based  on  the  tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the end of the reporting period.\n\nNo  deferred  tax  liability  is  recognized  in  respect  of undistributed earnings of subsidiaries that are not intended to be distributed.\n\nFor investments in subsidiaries, deferred tax is recognized on  the  difference  between  the  consolidated  carrying amount of the investments and their tax basis when it is probable that the temporary difference will reverse in the foreseeable future.\n\nDeferred taxes are recognized as income or expense in the income  statement,  unless  they  relate  to  items  that  are recognized directly in equity, in which case they are also recognized in equity. Income tax resulting from changes in tax rates is recognized in income, except where it relates to items initially recognized in equity.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Deferred  tax  liabilities  of  \u20ac824 million  were recognized  at  December  31,  2023  (\u20ac768  million  at December  31,  2022)  across  different  countries,  including \u20ac206  million  in  Canada,  \u20ac187 million  in  the  United Kingdom, \u20ac107 million in the United States, \u20ac58 million in Switzerland,  \u20ac44  million  in  India  and  \u20ac32  million  in Denmark.  Deferred  tax  liabilities  recognized  in  other countries represented considerably smaller amounts.\n\n## 12.3  Tax loss carry-forwards\n\nDeferred tax assets are recognized only if it is considered probable that there will be sufficient future taxable income against  which  the  temporary  difference  can  be  utilized. They are reviewed at the end of each reporting period and written  down  to  the  extent  that  it  is  no  longer  probable that there will be sufficient taxable income against which the  temporary  difference  can  be  utilized.  In  determining whether  to  recognize  deferred  tax  assets  for  tax  loss carry-forwards, the Group applies a range of criteria that take into account the probable recovery period based on business plans and the strategy for the long-term recovery of tax losses applied in each country.\n\nThe  Group  recognized  deferred  tax  assets  for  tax  loss carry-forwards  for  a  net  amount  of  \u20ac215  million  at December 31, 2023 and \u20ac294 million at December 31, 2022. This principally relates to the United States, for which the recovery  period  is  shorter  than  the  maximum  utilization period  of  20  years,  and  to  France,  Germany  and  Spain, where  tax  consolidation  generally  ensures  that  deferred tax can be recovered. In these countries, tax losses may be carried  forward  indefinitely.  Nevertheless,  after  analyzing each  situation,  the  Group  may  decide  not  to  recognize them.\n\nAt December 31, 2023, deferred tax assets whose recovery is not considered probable totaled \u20ac226 million (December 31, 2022:  \u20ac274  million)  and  a  provision  had been accrued for the full amount. Provisions for deferred tax  assets  chiefly  relate  to  Germany,  the  United  States, Spain and Belgium.\n\nNote that the improved deferred tax position in France in 2022 had led  to  a  reversal  of  provisions  for  losses  in  an amount of \u20ac59 million.",

We  believe  that  the  audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\nOur responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Statutory Auditors' Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of our report.\n\n## Independence\n\nWe conducted our audit engagement in compliance with independence requirements of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce) and the French Code of Ethics (Code de d\u00e9ontologie) for statutory auditors, for the period from January 1, 2023, to the date of our report, and specifically we did not provide any prohibited non-audit services referred to in Article 5(1) of Regulation (EU) No 537/2014.\n\n## Justification of Assessments - Key Audit Matters\n\nIn  accordance  with  the  requirements  of  Articles  L.821-53  and  R.821-180  of  the  French  Commercial  Code  (Code  de commerce) relating to the justification of our assessments, we inform you of the key audit matters relating to risks of material  misstatement  that,  in  our  professional  judgment,  were  of  most  significance  in  our  audit  of  the  consolidated financial statements of the current period, as well as how we addressed those risks.\n\nThese matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, approved in  the  conditions mentioned above, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on specific items of the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Valuation of goodwill, intangible assets and property, plant & equipment\n\n## Description of risk\n\nThe net carrying amounts of goodwill, others intangible assets and property, plant & equipment were material at December 31, 2023, representing \u20ac13,111 million, \u20ac4,368 million, and \u20ac12,744 million, respectively that is to say 53% of total assets.\n\nThese  assets  may  present  a  risk  of  impairment  due  to  internal  or  external  factors,  including  decisions  to  change  the Group's  strategy  in  certain  markets,  a  decline  in  Group  performance,  the  Group's  commitments  to  carbon  neutrality, changes in competition, unfavorable market conditions and changes in legislation or regulations. These changes are likely to have an impact on the Group's forecast cash flow and, consequently, the recoverable amount of assets.\n\nThe impairment tests performed by Management using the method described in Note 7.5 to the consolidated financial statements led to book an impairment loss of \u20ac238 million in the year ended December 31, 2023 as indicated in Note 5.1.4 to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe  valuation  of  these  assets  is  a  key  audit  matter,  particularly  for  the  cash  generating  units  presenting  a  risk  of impairment,  given  the  materiality  of  their  amount  in  the  consolidated  balance  sheet  and  the  high  level  of  judgment required  by  Management  in  assessing  impairment  losses.  Judgements  include  multiples  of  a  normative  basis  of performance and assumptions regarding future changes in revenue in volume and value, profitability, investments and other cash flows related to the operation of these assets, as well as the determination of an appropriate discount rate applied to future cash flows.\n\n## How our audit addressed this risk\n\n<!-- image -->",

We tested the effectiveness of the controls implemented by the Group to ensure the quality and reliability of these procedures and their consistency with data from the budget and the medium-term business plan prepared by Management.\n\nWe also assessed the consistency and relevance of Management's approach to determining the cash-generating units for asset impairment testing.  We adapted our audit approach to the risk of impairment, which varies depending on the cashgenerating unit.\n\nOur  valuation  specialists  performed  an  independent  analysis  of  certain  key  assumptions  used  by  Management  for impairment  testing  purposes,  in  particular  the  discount  rate,  the  average  perpetual  growth  rate  or  multiples  of  a normative performance basis deemed appropriate to the valuation of cash-generating units, by referring to both external market data and comparable company analyses.\n\nFor the most sensitive cash-generating units presenting a risk of impairment, we analyzed the consistency of future cash flow projections with regard to past performance and our knowledge of the business, confirmed by interviews with the Heads of the relevant Businesses. We paid particularly close attention to the calculation of the normalized amount of terminal cash flows projected to perpetuity. We performed our own sensitivity analyses of certain key variables of the measurement model, particularly with regard to the inclusion of CO2 emissions when assessing the materiality of potential impacts on the recoverable amounts of the most high-risk assets.\n\nWe verified that the disclosures provided in the notes 5.1.4, 7.1, 7.2, 7.3 et 7.5 to the consolidated financial statements on the valuation of goodwill, intangible assets and property, plant & equipment, the underlying assumptions and sensitivity analyses were appropriate.\n\n## Measurement of provisions related to asbestos litigations in the United-State of America Description of risk\n\nAs indicated in Note 9.2.2 to the consolidated financial statements, the risk of being called upon to finance the costs of the bankruptcy proceedings of DBMP, an affiliate of CertainTeed LLC which holds the historical liabilities of the former entity CertainTeed Corporation, is subject to a provision amounting to $407 million (\u20ac369 million) at December 31, 2023.\n\nWith regard to this funding risk, determining and measuring the provision recognized and assessing the appropriateness of the related disclosures in the notes to the consolidated financial statements are a key audit matter given the amounts involved  and  the  high  degree  of  estimation  and  judgment  required  by  Management  in  determining  this  provision. Judgment is required, in particular, to assess the status and resolution of the ongoing legal proceedings (in particular the voluntary petition for relief  under  Chapter 11  of  the  US  Bankruptcy  Code):  duration,  cost,  estimation  of  the  number  of current and future cases covered, definition of the damages by the judicial authority.\n\n## How our audit addressed this risk\n\nTo obtain an understanding of contingent liabilities and litigation regarding asbestos in the United States and the related judgments made, we held discussions with Management at the Group and country level as well as at the main subsidiaries concerned. We also contacted certain law firms and external experts chosen by Management to assist them with the monitoring of these risks.\n\n## We:\n\n- \u00b7 examined the minutes of the Board of Directors' meetings and the Group's risk mapping prepared by Management and presented to the Audit and Risk Committee;\n- \u00b7 familiarized ourselves with the procedures implemented by Management when measuring the provisions for asbestosrelated risks in the United States and determining the disclosures thereon in the notes to the consolidated financial statements;\n- \u00b7 assessed the permanence of methods and performed a critical review of internal analyses relating to the probability and possible impact of these risks and new items of litigation by examining the available information relating to the proceedings  (correspondence,  judgments,  notifications,  etc.).  We  also  reviewed  the  responses  to  the  confirmation letters  of  the  law  firms  chosen  by  Management,  particularly  in  terms  of  their  experience  at  resolving  comparable situations in the past. We also used our professional judgment to assess the positions adopted by Management, to see where they fell within risk assessment ranges and the consistency of those positions over time;\n- \u00b7 verified the arithmetical accuracy of the calculations of changes in provisions and the consistency of the main items of change in relation to the underlying data, in particular the payments made during the year in respect of these risks.\n\nWe  assessed  the  appropriateness  of  the  disclosures  provided  in  note  9.2.2  to  the  consolidated  financial  statements regarding these items of litigation and contingent liabilities identified.",

This information should be reported on by an independent third party.\n\n## Other Legal and Regulatory Verifications or Information\n\n## Format of presentation of the consolidated financial statements intended to be included in the annual financial report\n\nWe  have  also  verified,  in  accordance  with  the  professional  standard  applicable  in  France  relating  to  the  procedures performed  by  the  statutory  auditor  relating  to  the  annual  and  consolidated  financial  statements  presented  in  the European single electronic format, that the presentation of the consolidated financial statements intended to be included in the annual financial report mentioned in Article L. 451-1-2, I of the French Monetary and Financial Code (Code mon\u00e9taire et financier), prepared under the responsibility of the General Manager, complies with the single electronic format defined in  the  European  Delegated  Regulation  No  2019/815  of  17  December  2018.  As  it  relates  to  consolidated  financial statements,  our  work  includes  verifying  that  the  tagging  of  these  consolidated  financial  statements  complies  with  the format defined in the above delegated regulation.\n\nBased  on  the  work  we  have  performed,  we  conclude  that  the  presentation  of  the  consolidated  financial  statements intended to be included in the annual financial report complies, in all material respects, with the European single electronic format.\n\nDue to the technical limitations inherent to the block-tagging of the consolidated financial statements according to the European  single  electronic  format,  the  content  of  certain  tags  of  the  notes  may  not  be  rendered  identically  to  the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\n\nMoreover, we have no responsibility to verify that the consolidated financial statements that will ultimately be included by your company in the annual financial report filed with the AMF are in agreement with those on which we have performed our work.\n\n## Appointment of the Statutory Auditors\n\nWe  were  appointed  as  statutory  auditors  of  Compagnie  de  Saint-Gobain  by  the  annual  general  meeting  held  on June 10, 2004, for KPMG and on June 2, 2022, for Deloitte & Associ\u00e9s.\n\nAs  at  December  31,  2023,  KPMG  and  Deloitte  &  Associ\u00e9s  were  in  the  20th  year  and  2nd  year  of  total  uninterrupted engagement.\n\n## Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nManagement  is  responsible  for  the  preparation  and  fair  presentation  of  the  consolidated  financial  statements  in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union, and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn  preparing  the  consolidated  financial  statements,  management  is  responsible  for  assessing  the  Company's  ability  to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless it is expected to liquidate the Company or to cease operations.\n\nThe  Audit  and  Risk  Committee  is  responsible  for  monitoring  the  financial  reporting  process  and  the  effectiveness  of internal  control  and  risks  management  systems  and  where  applicable,  its  internal  audit,  regarding  the  accounting  and financial reporting procedures.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements were approved by the Board of Directors.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Our objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about  whether  the  consolidated  financial  statements  as  a  whole  are  free  from  material  misstatement.  Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered  material  if,  individually  or  in  the  aggregate,  they  could  reasonably  be  expected  to  influence  the  economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.\n\nAs  specified  in  Article  L.  821-55  of  the  French  Commercial  Code  (Code  de  commerce),  our  statutory  audit  does  not include assurance on the viability of the Company or the quality of management of the affairs of the Company.\n\nAs  part  of  an  audit  conducted  in  accordance  with  professional  standards  applicable  in  France,  the  statutory  auditor exercises professional judgment throughout the audit and furthermore:\n\n- \u00b7 Identifies  and  assesses  the  risks  of  material  misstatement  of  the  consolidated  financial  statements,  whether  due  to fraud or error, designs and performs audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtains audit evidence considered to be sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for his opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting  from  fraud  is  higher  than  for  one  resulting  from  error,  as  fraud  may  involve  collusion,  forgery,  intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- \u00b7 Obtains  an  understanding  of  internal  control  relevant  to  the  audit  in  order  to  design  audit  procedures  that  are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the internal control.\n- \u00b7 Evaluates the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management in the consolidated financial statements.\n- \u00b7 Assesses the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence  obtained,  whether  a  material  uncertainty  exists  related  to  events  or  conditions  that  may  cast  significant doubt  on  the  Company's  ability  to  continue  as  a  going  concern.  This  assessment  is  based  on  the  audit  evidence obtained up to the date of his audit report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern. If the statutory auditor concludes that a material uncertainty exists, there is a requirement to  draw  attention  in  the  audit  report  to  the  related  disclosures  in  the  consolidated  financial  statements  or,  if  such disclosures are not provided or inadequate, to modify the opinion expressed therein.\n- \u00b7 Evaluates  the  overall  presentation  of  the  consolidated  financial  statements  and  assesses  whether  these  statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n- \u00b7 Obtains sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. The statutory auditor is responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the audit of the consolidated financial statements and for the opinion expressed on these consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Report to the Audit and Risk Committee\n\nWe submit a report to the Audit and Risk Committee which includes in particular a description of the scope of the audit and the audit program implemented, as well as the results of our audit. We also report, if any, significant deficiencies in internal control regarding the accounting and financial reporting procedures that we have identified.\n\nOur  report  to  the  Audit  and  Risk  Committee    includes  the  risks  of  material  misstatement  that,  in  our  professional judgment, were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and which are therefore the key audit matters, that we are required to describe in this report.\n\nWe also provide the Audit and Risk Committee with the declaration provided for in Article 6 of Regulation (EU) N\u00b0537-2014, confirming our independence within the meaning of the rules applicable in France such as they are set in particular by Articles L.821-7 to L.821-34 of the French Commercial Code and in the French Code of Ethics (code de d\u00e9ontologie) for statutory auditors. Where appropriate, we discuss with the Audit and Risk Committee the risks that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and the related safeguards.\n\nParis-La D\u00e9fense, February 29, 2024\n\nThe Statutory Auditors\n\nFrench original signed by\n\nKPMG S.A.\n\nDeloitte & Associ\u00e9s\n\nPierre-Antoine DUFFAUD                    Laurent CHILLET\n\nFr\u00e9d\u00e9ric GOURD\n\n\u00cb",

They  are depreciated  over  their  estimated  useful  lives  using  the straight-line method. The most commonly used useful lives are as follows:\n\n- \u2022 Buildings\n\n40\u00a0to\u00a050\u00a0years\n\n- Straight-line\n- \u2022 Improvements and\u00a0additions\n\n12\u00a0years\n\nStraight-line\n\n- \u2022 Fixtures and fittings\n\n5 to\u00a012\u00a0years\n\nStraight-line\n\n- \u2022 Office furniture\n\n10\u00a0years\n\nStraight-line\n\n- \u2022 Office equipment\n\n5\u00a0years\n\nStraight-line\n\n- \u2022 Vehicles\n\n4\u00a0years\n\nStraight-line\n\n- \u2022 IT equipment\n\n3\u00a0years\n\nStraight-line\n\n## Financial investments\n\nOn  initial  recognition,  investments  in  subsidiaries  and affiliates  are  stated  at  cost  including  incidental  expenses. Periodically, and  particularly when  an  inventory  is performed, the net carrying amount of the investments is compared with their fair value (value in use). Fair value is estimated based on various criteria: the Company's equity in  the  underlying  net  assets,  proportion  of  consolidated net  assets,  net  present  value  of  future  cash  flows, excluding  interest  expense  but  after  tax,  based  on business  plans  (or  long-term  budget  projections),  or  a multiple of a normative performance basis.\n\nWhen  the  fair  value  of  the  investments  falls  below  their carrying  amount,  a  provision  is  set  aside  for  impairment. No  unrealized  capital  gain  is  recorded  if  their  fair  value exceeds  their  carrying  amount,  and  unrealized  capital gains and losses are not offset.\n\n\u00cb\n\n## Treasury shares\n\nTreasury shares held by the Company for cancelation are recorded  in  the  balance  sheet  under  \"Other  investment securities\". They are carried at acquisition cost and are not revalued or provisioned.\n\nTreasury shares held by the Company for allocation upon exercise  of  stock  options  are  recorded  in  the  balance sheet under \"Marketable securities\".\n\nTreasury shares held by the Company for allocation under performance share plans are also recorded in the balance sheet  under  \"Marketable  securities\".  These  shares  are valued  in  accordance  with  the  first  in/first  out  (FIFO) method, and are not revalued or provisioned.\n\nWhere  appropriate,  a  provision  for  contingencies  and charges is recognized in respect of these plans, corresponding  to  the  outflow  of  resources  expected  by the Company. This is calculated based on the number of shares  likely  to  be  delivered  to  the  beneficiaries  and  the acquisition  cost  of  the  shares  at  the  date  they  are allocated to the plan or the likely cost of repurchasing the shares as measured at the reporting date. The provision is recognized on a pro rata basis over the vesting period.\n\n## Receivables\n\nReceivables are stated at nominal value. A provision is set aside  for  impairment  when  their  realizable  value  is  less than their book value.\n\n## Marketable securities\n\nMarketable securities mainly include units in money market funds  (OPCVM  and  FCP)  and  are  stated  at  the  lower  of acquisition cost and market value at year-end.",

        "page_content": "Compagnie de Saint -Gobain 2023 annual financial statements (parent company)\n\n## Foreign currency transactions\n\nIncome and expenses in foreign currencies are recorded at the euro exchange rate prevailing on the transaction date. Receivables,  payables  and  bank  balances  in  foreign currencies  are  translated  at  the  year-end  exchange  rate, along with the related hedging instruments, and differences  arising  on  translation  are  recorded  under translation gains or losses. Provisions are booked for any exceptional  unrealized  translation  losses  that  are  not hedged.\n\n## Risk management/financial instruments\n\nLiquidity  risk  is  managed  with  the  main  objective  of ensuring the timely rollover of the Group's financing at an optimal  cost.  Long-term  debt  therefore  systematically represents a high proportion of overall debt. At the same time, the maturity schedules of long-term debt are set in such  a  way  that  replacement  capital  market  issues  are spread over time.\n\nCurrency,  interest  rate  and  commodity  (energy  and  raw material price) risks arising from the Group's international operations  are  hedged  by  Compagnie  de  Saint-Gobain, mainly on behalf of subsidiaries. Currency risk is primarily hedged through forward purchase and sale contracts and currency options, while interest rate risk is hedged mainly through swaps and cross-currency swaps.\n\nCompagnie de Saint-Gobain applies regulation no. 2015-05 of July 2, 2015 issued by the French accounting standardssetter  ( Autorit\u00e9  des  normes  comptables -  ANC)  on forward financial instruments and hedging operations.\n\n## Pension obligations\n\nThe Company's obligations under supplementary pension plans and retirement bonuses are measured by independent  actuaries  using  the  projected  unit  credit method (based on final  salary  and  benefit  obligations  as determined at the measurement date). Pension obligations are  included  within  provisions  for  contingencies  and charges.\n\nActuarial  gains  and  losses  arising  in  the  year  under defined-benefit retirement plans are recognized immediately and in full in the income statement.\n\nThe provision for retirement bonuses has been calculated in  accordance  with  the  November  17,  2021  revision  to Recommendation  No.  2013-02  issued  by  the  French accounting standards-setter (ANC) regarding the rules for measuring  and  recognizing  pension  and  other  benefit obligations.\n\n## Tax consolidation agreements\n\nCompagnie  de  Saint-Gobain  is  the  parent  company  of  a tax  consolidation  group  under  the  group  relief  regime provided  for  in  Articles  223  A  et  seq.  of  the  French  Tax Code ( Code g\u00e9n\u00e9ral des imp\u00f4ts ).\n\nThe tax consolidation agreements between Compagnie de Saint-Gobain and its subsidiaries provide for tax neutrality for  consolidated  subsidiaries.  In  their  relationship  with Compagnie  de  Saint-Gobain,  the  consolidating  parent company, the subsidiaries discharge their taxes as if they had been taxed on a stand-alone basis. When loss-making companies  leave  the  Group,  they  are  not,  in  principle, entitled  to  any  payments  for  losses  transferred  to  the consolidating  parent  company  during  the  consolidation period.\n\n## NOTE 2 OPERATING INCOME/(LOSS)\n\nThe operating loss came out \u20ac85 million higher than in 2022, due mainly to a decrease in discount rates in 2023, which generated  actuarial  gains  on  pension  obligations  (increase  in  obligations  with  a  corresponding  increase  in  operating expense), compared with actuarial losses in the previous year.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Dividends received from subsidiaries declined by \u20ac136 million to \u20ac888 million in 2023, while 2023 profit transferred from subsidiaries of the German branch decreased by \u20ac8 million.\n\n## NOTE 4 EXCEPTIONAL ITEMS\n\nThe Company recorded a net exceptional expense of \u20ac61 million in 2023 compared to a net exceptional expense of \u20ac19  million  in  2022.  The  expense  in  2023  mainly  reflects\n\nthe increase in provisions related to the Group's long-term compensation plans, while in 2022 it was due to provisions recorded at the level of the German branch.\n\n## NOTE 5 INCOME TAXES\n\nThe  Company  recorded  an  income  tax  benefit  of  \u20ac159 million  in  2023,  comprising  a  \u20ac174  million  income  tax benefit under the tax consolidation regime in France and a \u20ac15 million income tax expense for the German entity.\n\nThe French tax group generated a tax profit in 2023. 50% of  the  2023  tax  profit  is  therefore  charged  against  tax losses  carried  forward  from  prior  years.  At  December  31, 2023, total cumulative tax loss carry-forwards represented \u20ac205 million.\n\nCompagnie de Saint-Gobain's permanent German establishment is the head of the Group's Organschaft local tax consolidation regime.\n\nAt December 31, 2023, future tax savings corresponding to the branch's unused tax loss carry-forwards amounted to \u20ac30 million.\n\n## NOTE 6 INTANGIBLE ASSETS\n\n|                                 | Intangible assets   | Intangible assets   | Intangible assets          | Intangible assets                                    | Intangible assets        | Amortization              | Net  value               | Net  value                       | Net  value        |    |\n|---------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------|----------------------------------|-------------------|----|\n| (in EUR  millions)              | Gross at  Jan. 1,   | 2023 Additions      | Disposals  (retire- ments) | Transfer  of intangible assets  under construc- tion | Gross at  Dec. 31,  2023 | Accumu- lated at  Jan. 1, | 2023 Increases Decreases | Accumu- lated at  Dec. 31,  2023 | At Dec.  31, 2023 |    |\n| Purchased  goodwill             | 1                   |                     |                            |                                                      | 1                        | 1                         |                          | 1                                | 0                 |    |\n| Other intangible  assets        | 55                  | 0                   |                            | 0                                                    | 55                       | 51                        | 1                        | 52                               | 3                 |    |\n| Intangible  assets in  progress | 0                   |                     |                            | 0                                                    |                          | 0                         |                          | 0                                |                   |    |\n| TOTAL                           | 56                  | 0                   |                            | 0                                                    | 56                       | 52                        | 1                        | 53                               | 3                 |    |\n\n\u00cb\n\nIn  addition,  the  rise  in  interest  rates  led  to  a  \u20ac61  million improvement in net interest income and expense, as well as  a  \u20ac55  million  increase  in  income  from  sales  of marketable securities.",

Eligible employees must have completed a  minimum  of  three  months'  service  with  the  Group. Eligible  employees  are  able  to  invest  in  Saint-Gobain shares  at  a  preferential  subscription  price.  These  shares are  held  either  directly  or  through  the  employee  saving plan's mutual funds, depending on local legislation, and are subject  to  a  mandatory  five-  or  ten-year  lock-up,  except following  the  occurrence  of  certain  events.  The  Board  of Directors delegates authorization for setting the subscription  price  to  the  Chief  Executive  Officer  of Compagnie  de  Saint-Gobain.  It  corresponds  to  the average of the opening prices for the Saint-Gobain share on Euronext Paris over the 20 trading days preceding the date  of  the  decision,  subject  to  a  20%  discount,  in accordance  with  applicable  laws, the Shareholders' Meeting resolutions and the deliberations of the Board of Directors.\n\nIn 2023, 4,778,291 new shares with a par value of \u20ac4 were issued  to  employees  under  the  PEG  at  an  average subscription  price  of  \u20ac44.19  (4,916,097  shares  at  an average  price  of  \u20ac45.19  in  2022),  representing  a  share capital increase of \u20ac210 million (\u20ac222 million in 2022), net of transaction fees.\n\n## 12.6 Potential number of shares\n\nAt the Shareholders' Meeting of June 2, 2022, shareholders authorized  the  Board  of  Directors  of  Compagnie  de Saint -Gobain to:\n\n- \u00b7 grant stock purchase or subscription options exercisable  for  new  or  existing  shares,  subject  in particular  to  performance  conditions,  representing  up to 1.5% of capital stock on the date of the Shareholders' Meeting,  with  a  sub-limit  of  10%  of  this  limit  for corporate  officers  of  Compagnie  de  Saint-Gobain,  i.e., 7,934,005  options,  including  a  maximum  of  793,401 options  for  corporate  officers  (17th  Resolution/38month  authorization  commencing  June  2,  2022).  It should  be  noted  that  this  limit  of  1.5%  of  the  capital stock will be set off against the threshold set in the 18th Resolution for the performance share grants mentioned below, and that this 1.5% limit represents the aggregate limit  for  shares  resulting  from  the  exercise  of  options granted  under  and  within  the  limit  of  the  17th Resolution  and  shares  granted  under  and  within  the limit of the 18 th Resolution;\n- \u00b7 grant  free  existing  shares,  subject  in  particular  to performance conditions, representing up to 1.2% of the capital stock on the date of the Shareholders' Meeting, with a sub-limit of 10% of this limit for corporate officers of  Compagnie  de  Saint-Gobain,  i.e.,  6,347,204  free shares, including a maximum of 634,720 free shares for corporate officers (18th Resolution/38-month authorization  commencing  June  2,  2022).  The  limit  of 1.2% and sub-limit of 10% are being set off against the limits  specified  under  the  17th  Resolution  of  the Shareholders'  Meeting  referred  to  above  regarding stock options. The Board of Directors made partial use of this authorization by granting 1,268,633 performance shares  (including  75,000  for  corporate  officers)  on November 23, 2023 (see section 12.3).\n\nAt the Shareholders' Meeting of June 8, 2023, shareholders  authorized  the  Board  of  Directors  of Compagnie de Saint-Gobain to:\n\n- \u00b7 issue,  on  one  or  several  occasions,  up  to  103,000,000 new  shares  or  securities  giving  access  to  the  share capital  of  the  Company  or  its  subsidiaries,  with preferential  subscription  rights,  or  without  preferential subscription rights but with a priority period for existing shareholders, by public offering, or without preferential subscription  rights  by  private  placement,  or  to  issue new  shares  through  the  capitalization of share premiums,  reserves,  profits  or  other  amounts,  or without preferential subscription rights in consideration of contributions in kind (14th to 19th Resolutions/26 month authorization commencing June 8, 2023);\n- \u00b7 issue,  on  one  or  several  occasions,  up  to  13,000,000 new  shares  to  members  of  the  Group  Savings  Plan (21 st Resolution/26-month  authorization  commencing June 8, 2023).\n\nIf all the stock options outstanding under the most recent plan  were  to  be  exercised,  and  the  shares  issued,  this would potentially have the effect of increasing the number of shares outstanding to 506,589,426 shares. In addition, if the authorizations described above were to be used in full by the Board of Directors, this would potentially have the effect  of  increasing  the  number  of  shares  outstanding  to 628,022,006 shares.\n\n<!-- image -->",

In May 2014, the Commission Secretariat  issued  a  notice  of  complaints  against  Sanitas Troesch and other wholesalers in the industry alleging that Sanitas Troesch and some of its competitors had, among other  things,  agreed  in  2005  and  2012  to  lower  gross prices.\n\nNon-audit services provided by the Statutory Auditors to Compagnie  de  Saint-Gobain  relate  mainly  to  audit procedures carried out as an independent third party on the management report on CSR information, due diligence in the context of planned acquisitions or divestments, and procedures  related  to  the  issuance  of  comfort  letters  in the case of new bond issues.\n\n## Management compensation\n\nTotal gross compensation and benefits paid in 2023 by the French and foreign companies in the Group to members of the Executive Committee as it stood at December 31, 2023 (excluding  any  long-term  compensation)  amounted  to \u20ac17.8 million (2022: \u20ac15.3 million), including \u20ac7.2 million in gross variable compensation (2022: \u20ac5.7 million).\n\nProvisions  for  pensions  and  other  post-employment benefit  obligations  (defined-benefit  obligations  [DBO]  in respect of length-of-service awards and pensions) accruing to members of the Group's management bodies totaled \u20ac40.5 million (2022: \u20ac29.2 million).\n\nCompensation paid to members of the Board of Directors for 2023 totaled \u20ac1.3 million (2022: \u20ac1.1 million).\n\nThe total  fine  imposed  on  all  companies  involved  is  CHF 80 million. For Sanitas Troesch, the fine is CHF 28.8 million. Sanitas Troesch appealed this decision on May 2, 2016 and continues  to  firmly  refute  the  claims  made.  The  hearing took  place  before  the  Federal  Administrative  Court  on January  21,  2020  and  the  date  on  which  the  Federal Administrative  Court  will  issue  its  decision  is  not  yet known. However, a provision for claims and litigation was recognized at December 31, 2015 in an amount equivalent to the fine (unchanged as at December 31, 2023).\n\n## Investigations by Competition Authorities in the additives and admixtures sector\n\nThe European Commission, the Competition and Markets Authority in the UK and the Turkish competition authority have launched investigations into anti-competitive practices in relation to the supply of chemical additives for cement and chemical admixtures for concrete and mortar. As of 31 December 2023, no statement of objections has been issued.\n\nIncidentally, class actions have been instituted against the Group in the United States and Canada in connection with these investigations which remain at a preliminary stage\n\n<!-- image -->",

The matter remains pending. The purpose of the filing is to achieve a certain,  final  and  equitable  resolution  of  all  current  and future  claims  arising  from  asbestos-containing  products manufactured  and  sold  by  the  former  CertainTeed Corporation.\n\nDBMP LLC intends to seek court authority to establish a trust under section 524(g) of the US Bankruptcy Code - a specific provision that is applicable to companies that face substantial  numbers  of  asbestos-related  claims  -  to achieve  a  fair  and  equitable  resolution  of  its  asbestosrelated liabilities. Upon establishment of the trust, current and future plaintiffs with qualifying claims will be able to receive  faster  payment  of  their  claims  without  the  delay, stress  and  uncertainty  of  litigation  in  the  tort  system;  at the same time, the creation and funding of such a trust will permanently  and  finally  resolve  DBMP  LLC's  asbestos liability.\n\nDuring  the  course  of  this  bankruptcy  process,  which  is expected to take up to approximately five to eight years, all  asbestos  litigations  have  been  stayed  and  all  related costs suspended, providing DBMP LLC with the time and protection to negotiate an agreement to be approved on behalf of all claimants and by the court.\n\nThis  action  was  taken  as  a  result  of  the  increasing  risks presented in  the  US  tort  system.  Despite  the  passage  of time, the aging of the population and lessening opportunity  for  claimants  to  assert  legitimate  claims  of exposure  to  the  asbestos-containing  products  of  the former  CertainTeed  Corporation,  naming  practices  in  the tort  system  continued  to  result  in  a  steady  volume  of claims against DBMP LLC, with no foreseeable end in sight. In  addition,  there  has  been,  in  general,  an  escalation  of settlement demands and verdicts in the tort system.\n\nCertain adversary  proceedings  have  been  filed  by representatives  of  current  and  future  asbestos  plaintiffs against DBMP  LLC,  CertainTeed  LLC,  Saint -Gobain Corporation,  Compagnie  de  Saint -Gobain  and  various other  parties.  No  decisions  on  the  merits  of  the  claims have  been  made  and  such  claims  do  not  affect  the Company's financial assessment of the Chapter 11 case.",

        "page_content": "Compagnie de Saint -Gobain 2023 annual financial statements (parent company)\n\n## Impact on the financial statements\n\nFollowing  the  commencement  of  the  proceeding  under Chapter  11  of  the  US  Bankruptcy  Code  on  January  23, 2020,  the  assets  and  liabilities  of  DBMP  LLC  and  its wholly-owned  subsidiary  Millwork  &  Panel  LLC,  and  in particular  the  provision  for  asbestos-related  litigation  in the  United  States,  are  no  longer  consolidated  in  the Group's financial statements.\n\nNonetheless,  because  of  a  funding  agreement  between CertainTeed  LLC  and  DBMP  LLC  by  which  CertainTeed LLC has agreed to fund the costs of the Chapter 11 case and, ultimately, the 524(g) trust, in both cases solely to the extent  DBMP  LLC  is  unable  to  do  so  in  full,  the  Group recorded  in  its  consolidated  financial  statements  a provision  corresponding  to  the  amount  of  the  estimated debt against DBMP LLC amounting to $407 million as of December 31, 2023 ($410 million as of December 31, 2022). The Group's consolidated income for 2023 is not impacted by the ongoing Chapter 11 proceeding described above.\n\nAs a result  of  this  bankruptcy  proceeding,  all  legal  costs and indemnity payments related to DBMP LLC's asbestos tort claims have been suspended, and no further charges in  relation  to  such  claims have been taken in 2023 (as in 2022).\n\n## Situation in Brazil\n\nIn Brazil, former employees  of  Brasilit, that once manufactured fiber cement containing asbestos, suffering from  asbestos-related  occupational  illnesses  are  offered, depending  on  the  case,  either  financial  compensation alone  or  lifetime  medical  assistance  combined  with financial compensation. Around 1,200 contractual instruments have accordingly been signed to date.\n\nTwo class actions were initiated against Brasilit in 2017 by two associations defending former employees exposed to asbestos at the S\u00e3o Caetano (S\u00e3o Paulo state) and Recife (Pernambuco  state)  plants,  asking  for  their  medical assistance  and  compensation  to  be  revised.  First  and second  instance  decisions  were  rendered  in  connection with the suit related to the S\u00e3o Caetano plant respectively in  July  2020  and  July  2021,  rejecting  the  claims  of  the plaintiffs. The  latter  have  nevertheless  appealed  the second  instance  decision.  First  and  second  instance decisions  were  rendered  in  relation  to  Recife  case, respectively  in  February  and  October  2022  rejecting  the claiming party arguments. The plaintiff has appealed such second instance decision.\n\nA third class action was initiated against Brasilit in 2019 in Capivari  (State  of  S\u00e3o  Paulo)  by  the  Labor  prosecutor asking  for  health  insurance,  as  well  as  collective  moral damages,  in  favor  of  employees,  former  employees  and their  respective  families,  as  well  as  subcontractors  who were  exposed  to  asbestos.  First  and  second  instance decisions were rendered respectively in September 2020 and May 2023 partly in favor of the plaintiffs. In particular, collective  moral  damages  were  granted  to  the  plaintiffs, for  an  amount  reduced  to  BRL  5  million  (\u20ac0.8  million). Brasilit has appealed the second instance decision.\n\nBrasilit is subject to controls by the Ministry of Labor and continues  to  comply  with  all  of  its  legal  obligations  with\n\nregard  to  medical  assistance  for  its  current  and  former employees.\n\nIn November 2017, the Supreme Court of Brazil decided to ban  asbestos  definitively  across  the  country.  Brasilit stopped using asbestos voluntarily as early as 2002.\n\n## 20.3  Environmental disputes\n\n## PFOA proceedings in the United States\n\nLevels  of  PFOA  (perfluorooctanoic  acid)  in  excess  of  US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) health advisories or  state  maximum  contaminant  levels  for  drinking  water have been found in municipal water systems and private wells near current Saint -Gobain Performance Plastics (SG PPL) facilities in Hoosick Falls (New York) and Merrimack (New  Hampshire),  and  two  former  facilities  in  North Bennington  (Vermont)  in  the  United  States.  PFOA  and PTFE (polytetrafluorethylene) have never been manufactured  by  these  plants.  SG  PPL  is  a  processor  of PTFE  which  it  purchases  from  third  party  suppliers  and which in the past contained some PFOA.\n\nSG PPL has voluntarily provided bottled water in all three communities, installed point-of-entry treatment systems to residents and businesses in all three communities, installed carbon filtration systems on the municipal water supply in Hoosick  Falls  and  funded  the  installation  of  a  carbon filtration system  on  the  Merrimack  Valley  District's municipal  water  supply.  In  addition,  it  has  voluntarily funded  construction  of  water  line  extensions  in  certain communities in the Merrimack and Bennington areas. The investigations are on-going and the scope of responsibility for SG PPL arising from environmental remediation in New Hampshire  and  New  York  and  clean-up  obligations  at these sites has not yet been established. The scope of the remediation in Vermont is defined and largely completed; future  operation  and  maintenance  obligations  remain. Without  admitting  liability,  SG  PPL  has  signed  consent orders  with  the  environmental  regulators  in  New  York  in 2016 and 2023 in Vermont in 2017 and 2019 with respect to  two  different  areas,  and  in  New  Hampshire  in  2018, pursuant  to  which  SG  PPL  has  agreed  to  complete investigations,  implement  interim  or  final  remediation measures  at  its  current  and  former  facilities  and  in  the case of Vermont and New Hampshire, fund construction of water lines. Responsibility, if any, is expected to be shared with other parties as regards in particular the Hoosick Falls site.\n\nPFOA-related  lawsuits  alleging  both  health-related  and economic damages claims have been filed in civil courts in New York, New Hampshire and Vermont, some of which are in the form of class actions. It is difficult to predict the timing or outcome of any such litigation, or whether any additional  litigation  will  be  brought  against  SG  PPL, however,  both  the  New  York  and  Vermont  class  actions are settled.\n\nOn  December  31,  2023,  the  provision  recorded  by  the Company  in  respect  of  this  matter  amounts  to  \u20ac226 million  (compared  to  \u20ac201  million  as  of  December  31, 2012). This provision covers  both  remediation  and litigation related to PFOA matters.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Insulation  materials from two Celotex ranges were purchased via distributors and  used  in  refurbishing  Grenfell  Tower,  London  in 2015/2016, including as one component of the rainscreen cladding system designed and installed (by third parties) on the tower's external facade.\n\nFollowing the Grenfell Tower fire on June 14, 2017, a Public Inquiry  was  constituted  to  consider,  among  other  things, the  modifications  made  to  the  building  as  part  of  the refurbishment, the role played by the various construction professionals,  and  the  information  provided  by  the manufacturers  of  the  products  used.  The  Inquiry's  work was  divided  into  two  phases.  Its  phase  1  report  was published  on  October  30,  2019.  Phase  2  commenced  in January  2020  and  public  hearings  are  complete.  A  final report  is  expected  to  follow  later  this  year.  A  criminal investigation  into  the  circumstances  of  the  fire  is  also  in progress.\n\nThere are a large number of issues and circumstances that need to be explored and the full implications for Celotex Limited  and  Saint-Gobain  Construction  Products  UK Limited are unlikely to be known for some time.\n\nCivil proceedings  in  connection  with  Grenfell  Tower brought  against  Celotex  Limited  and/or  Saint -Gobain Construction Products UK Limited and a number of other defendants  were  issued  by  bereaved,  survivors  and residents and emergency responders.\n\n## NOTE 21 SUBSEQUENT EVENTS\n\nOn February 26, 2024 Saint-Gobain announced that it has entered  into  a  definitive  agreement  with  CSR  Limited ('CSR') to acquire all of the outstanding shares of CSR by way of an Australian scheme of arrangement for A$9.00 per share, in cash, corresponding to an enterprise value of A$4.5 billion (c. \u20ac2.7 billion) and a net enterprise value of A$3.2  billion  (c.  \u20ac1.9  billion)  post  short  to  mid-term monetizable  property  value  of  at  least  A$1.3  billion.  This acquisition will be fully financed in cash.\n\n\u00cb\n\nFollowing confidential alternative dispute resolution processes  involving  a  number  of  parties,  confidential settlements  have  been  concluded  in  relation  to  the majority  of  these  claims  and  resulted  in  payments  to relevant  claimants  without  admission  of  liability.  Celotex Limited  is  continuing  to  engage  with  a  number  of  other defendants in an alternative dispute resolution process to seek  to  resolve  the  remaining  claims  brought  by  the emergency responders. The principal financial implications from the concluded settlements have been paid in full and are reflected in the financial statements as of 31 December 2023.\n\nThe  extent  to  which  Celotex  Limited  and  Saint -Gobain Construction  Products  UK  Limited  may  incur  further financial expenditure  or  civil  or  criminal  liability  in connection with the production, marketing, supply or use of their products is currently unclear and these companies are  currently  unable  to  make  a  reliable  estimate  of  their potential liability in this respect.\n\n## 20.5  Other proceedings and disputes\n\nSome of the Group's companies may also be the subject of other  claims  made  by  their  employees  or  by  the  tax authorities, or in the context of the enforcement of seller's warranties granted by the Group to the buyers of divested businesses  (see  .  p.  321,  note  5.5.2).  Apart  from  the proceedings and litigation described above, to the best of the Company's knowledge, no other government, court or arbitration proceedings exist (including pending proceedings  or  proceedings  where  the  Company  and/or the Group might be threatened) which could have or have had,  in  the  last  12  months,  a  significant  impact  on  the financial  position  or  profitability  of  the  Company  and/or Group.\n\nCSR is  a  leading  building  products  company  in  Australia for residential and  non-residential  construction  with A$2.7 billion in total revenue, 30 manufacturing plants and around 2,500 employees.\n\nClosing  of  the  transaction  is  subject  to,  among  other things, CSR's shareholders' approval, necessary regulatory approvals  and  satisfaction  of  other  customary  closing conditions,  with  closing  expected  in  the  second  half  of 2024.",

This  statutory  auditors'  report  includes  information required by French law, such as information about the appointment of the statutory auditors or verification of the management report  and  other  documents  provided  to  shareholders.This  report  should  be  read  in  conjunction  with,  and  construed  in accordance with, French law and professional auditing standards applicable in France.\n\n## For the year ended December 31, 2023\n\nTo the annual general meeting of COMPAGNIE DE SAINT-GOBAIN\n\n## Opinion\n\nIn compliance with the engagement entrusted to us by your annual general meeting, we have audited the accompanying financial statements of Compagnie de Saint-Gobain ('the Company') for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n\nIn our opinion, the financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets and liabilities and of the financial position of the Company, as at December 31, 2023 and of the results of its operations for the year then ended in accordance with French accounting principles.\n\nThe audit opinion expressed above is consistent with our report to the Audit and Risk Committee.\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\n## Audit Framework\n\nWe  conducted  our  audit  in  accordance  with  professional  standards  applicable  in  France.  We  believe  that  the  audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\nOur responsibilities under those standards are further described in the \"Statutory Auditors' Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements\" section of our report.\n\n## Independence\n\nWe conducted our audit engagement in compliance with independence requirements of the French Commercial Code (code de commerce) and the French Code of Ethics (code de d\u00e9ontologie) for statutory auditors, for the period from January 1, 2023 to the date of our report, and specifically we did not provide any prohibited non-audit services referred to in Article 5(1) of Regulation (EU) No 537/2014.\n\n## Justification of Assessments - Key Audit Matters\n\nIn accordance with the requirements of Articles L.821-53 and R. 821-180 of the French Commercial Code relating to the justification of our assessments, we inform you of the key audit matters relating to risks of material misstatement that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current period, as well as how we addressed those risks.\n\nThese  matters  were  addressed  in  the  context  of  our  audit  of  the  financial  statements  as  a  whole,  approved  in  the conditions mentioned above, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on specific items of the financial statements.\n\n## Measurement of investments in subsidiaries and affiliates and related loans and advances\n\n## Description of risk\n\nAt December 31, 2023, the carrying amount of the Company's investments in subsidiaries and affiliates and related loans and  advances  stood  respectively  at  \u20ac14,093  million  and  \u20ac14,400  million,  representing  77%  of  the  total  assets  of  the company. Investments in subsidiaries and affiliates are initially stated at historical cost including incidental expenses and are impaired, when applicable, based on their value in use.\n\nAs stated in Note 1 to the financial statements, the value in use is estimated periodically, and in particular at the closing date, using a multi-criteria approach: the company's equity in the underlying net assets, proportion of consolidated net assets, net value based on a multiple of a normative performance basis or net present value of future cash flows based on business plans (or long-term budget projections) excluding interest expenses but after tax.\n\nWhen the value in use is lower than the book value, a provision for impairment is recorded, the impairment losses could result in particular from a decline in the performance of certain subsidiaries or risks relating to the international locations of those companies.\n\nThe  impairment  tests  performed  by  Management  have  not  led  to  book  a  provision  for  impairment  or  a  reversal  of impairment for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n\nWe deemed the measurement of the investments in subsidiaries and affiliates and related loans and advances to be a key audit matter due to the materiality of these assets in the balance sheet and the high degree of estimation and judgment required from Management to assess the values in use. Management's judgment is based in part on assumptions relating, on the one hand, to the multiples applicable to the valuation of the investments and, on the other, to future changes in the cash flows relating to the investments, as well as to the calculation of the appropriate discount rate applied to future cash flows.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Where projected future cash flows  were  used,  we  analyzed  the  consistency  of  the  projections  with  past  performance  and  our  knowledge  of  the Company's business, supported by interviews with  managers  from  the  various  businesses,  and  in  so  far  as  they  were available, by external data relating to markets or competitors. We paid particularly close attention to the calculation of the normalized amount of the terminal cash flows projected to perpetuity.\n\n## Specific Verifications\n\nWe  have  also  performed,  in  accordance  with  professional  standards  applicable  in  France,  the  specific  verifications required by laws and regulations.\n\n## Information given in the management report and in the other documents with respect to the financial positions and the financial statements provided to the Shareholders\n\nWe  have  no  matters  to  report  as  to  the  fair  presentation  and  the  consistency  with  the  financial  statements  of  the information given in the management report of the Board of Directors and in the other documents with respect to the financial position and the financial statements provided to the shareholders.\n\nWe attest the fair presentation and the consistency with the financial statements of the information relating to payment deadlines mentioned in Article D.441-6 of the French Commercial Code (code de commerce).\n\n## Report on corporate governance\n\nWe attest that the Board of Directors' report on corporate governance sets out the information required by Article L. 225-37-4, L.22-10-10 and L. 22-10-9 the French Commercial Code (code de commerce).\n\nConcerning the information given in accordance with the requirements of Article L. 22-10-9 of the French Commercial Code (code de commerce) relating to remunerations and benefits received by or awarded to the directors and any other commitments made in their favour, we have verified its consistency with the financial statements, or with the underlying information  used  to  prepare  these  financial  statements  and,  where  applicable,  with  the  information  obtained  by  your company from controlled enterprises included in the scope of consolidation. Based on these procedures, we attest the accuracy and fair presentation of this information.\n\nWith respect to the information relating to items that your company considered likely to have an impact in the event of a takeover  bid  or  exchange  offer,  provided  pursuant  to  Article  L.  22-10-11  of  the  French  Commercial  Code  (code  de commerce), we have agreed this information to the source documents communicated to us. Based on these procedures, we have no observations to make on this information.\n\n## Other Information\n\nIn accordance with French law, we have verified that the required information concerning the identity of the shareholders and holders of the voting rights has been properly disclosed in the management report.\n\n## Other Legal and Regulatory Verifications or Information\n\n## Format of presentation of the financial statements intended to be included in the annual financial report\n\nWe  have  also  verified,  in  accordance  with  the  professional  standard  applicable  in  France  relating  to  the  procedures performed  by  the  statutory  auditor  relating  to  the  annual  and  consolidated  financial  statements  presented  in  the European single electronic format, that the presentation of the financial statements intended to be included in the annual financial report mentioned in Article L. 451-1-2, I of the French Monetary and Financial Code (code mon\u00e9taire et financier), prepared under the responsibility of the Chief Executive Officer, complies with the single electronic format defined in the European Delegated Regulation No 2019/815 of 17 December 2018.\n\nBased on the work we have performed, we conclude that the presentation of the financial statements intended to be included in the annual financial report complies, in all material respects, with the European single electronic format.\n\nWe have no responsibility to verify that the financial statements that will ultimately be included by your company in the annual financial report filed with the AMF are in agreement with those on which we have performed our work.\n\n## Appointment of the Statutory Auditors\n\nWe were appointed as statutory auditors of Compagnie de Saint-Gobain by the annual general meeting held on June 10, 2004, for KPMG and on June 2, 2022, for Deloitte & Associ\u00e9s.\n\nAs  at  December  31,  2023,  KPMG  and  Deloitte  &  Associ\u00e9s  were  in  the  20th  year  and  2nd  year  of  total  uninterrupted engagement, respectively.\n\n\u00cb",

Our objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nAs specified in Article L.821-55 of the French Commercial Code, our statutory audit does not include assurance on the viability of the Company or the quality of management of the affairs of the Company.\n\nAs  part  of  an  audit  conducted  in  accordance  with  professional  standards  applicable  in  France,  the  statutory  auditor exercises professional judgment throughout the audit and furthermore:\n\n- \u00b7 Identifies and assesses the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, designs  and  performs  audit  procedures  responsive  to  those  risks,  and  obtains  audit  evidence  considered  to  be sufficient  and  appropriate  to  provide  a  basis  for  his  opinion.  The  risk  of  not  detecting  a  material  misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- \u00b7 Obtains  an  understanding  of  internal  control  relevant  to  the  audit  in  order  to  design  audit  procedures  that  are appropriate  in  the  circumstances,  but  not  for  the  purpose  of  expressing  an  opinion  on  the  effectiveness  of  the internal control.\n- \u00b7 Evaluates  the  appropriateness  of  accounting  policies  used  and  the  reasonableness  of  accounting  estimates  and related disclosures made by management in the financial statements.\n- \u00b7 Assesses the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit  evidence  obtained,  whether  a  material  uncertainty  exists  related  to  events  or  conditions  that  may  cast significant doubt on the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. This assessment is based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of his audit report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern. If the statutory auditor concludes that a material uncertainty exists, there is a requirement to draw attention in the audit report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are not provided or inadequate, to modify the opinion expressed therein.\n- \u00b7 Evaluates the overall presentation of the financial statements and assesses whether these statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n\n<!-- image -->",

It consisted primarily of financial income  from  subsidiaries  and  affiliates (dividends  and  income  transfers  from  subsidiaries  of  the German  branch)  totaling  \u20ac1,057  million  in  2023  (2022: \u20ac1,201 million), an income tax benefit of \u20ac159 million (2022: \u20ac253 million) from the French and German  tax\n\nconsolidation  groups,  less  a  net  exceptional  expense  of \u20ac61 million (2022: \u20ac19 million) due mainly to provisions for performance share plans awarded to employees.\n\nShareholders'  equity  before  the  appropriation  of  income for the year totaled \u20ac17,497 million at December 31, 2023 (December 31, 2022: \u20ac17,826 million).\n\n## 8.5.1 SIGNIFICANT EVENTS DURING THE YEAR\n\n## Transactions involving shareholders' equity\n\nThe principal events that contributed to changes in capital stock and shareholders' equity were:\n\n- \u00b7 the May 16, 2023 increase in capital stock through the subscription  of  4,778,291  shares  under  the  Group Savings  Plan  at  a  price  of  \u20ac44.19  for  a  gross  and  net amount of \u20ac210 million;\n- \u00b7 the capital reductions of June 13, 2023 and October 10, 2023  through  the  cancellation  of  6,629,309  and 7,577,049 shares, respectively, for a total gross and net amount of \u20ac758 million\n- \u00b7 on  June  14,  2023,  the  Company  paid  dividends representing a total payout of \u20ac1,013 million.\n\n## Sale of the Distribution business in the United Kingdom\n\nOn March 1, 2023, Saint-Gobain completed the sale of all its merchanting brands in the United Kingdom - including the  builders  and  timber  merchant  Jewson  -  to  the  Stark group,  as  announced  on  December  12,  2022.  As  a  result, Saint-Gobain no longer has any distribution businesses in the UK.\n\nThe  divested  assets  generated  revenues  of  around  \u20ac2.7 billion  in  2022  with  an  operating  margin  of  around  2%. They comprise 600 outlets and employ 8,900 people. The divestment  was  made  based  on  an  enterprise  value  of GBP 740 million, i.e. around \u20ac850 million.\n\nIt  follows  the  divestment  of  specialist  distribution  brands in the United Kingdom over the last months representing around \u20ac650 million of revenues at around breakeven in terms of operating margin, based on an enterprise value of around \u20ac200 million.\n\nThese  divestments  are  part  of  Saint-Gobain's  continued business  profile  optimization  strategy  to  enhance  the Group's  growth  and  profitability  in  line  with  its  \"Grow  & Impact\" plan.\n\n## Acquisition of Building Products of Canada Corp.\n\nOn  June  12,  2023,  Saint-Gobain  announced  that  it  had entered  into  a  definitive  purchase  agreement  to  acquire Building Products of Canada Corp. ('Building Products of Canada'),  a  privately  owned  manufacturer  of  residential roofing  shingles  and  wood  fiber  insulation  panels  in Canada, for CAD 1,325 million (approximately \u20ac925 million) in  cash.  The  sale  was  completed  on  September  1,  2023 following  authorization  by  the  Canadian  Competition Bureau.\n\nWith this acquisition, Saint-Gobain has taken another step to  reinforce  its  leadership  in  sustainable  construction  in the  Canadian  market.  Thanks  to  Building  Products  of Canada, the Group will be well positioned to better serve Canadian  customers,  with  a  broader,  innovative  and sustainable range of solutions:\n\n- \u00b7 Building Products of Canada's roofing products extend Saint-Gobain's  Exterior  Solutions  offering  in  Canada, following  the  addition  of  the  siding  segment  with  the acquisition of Kaycan in 2022;\n- \u00b7 The  acquisition  rounds  out  the  existing  activities  of CertainTeed  Canada,  which  is  already  a  leader  in Interior Solutions (gypsum, insulation, ceilings).\n\n<!-- image -->",

He has also informed the Board of his decision to resign as a director on this occasion.\n\nIn this context, in 2021, the Board of Directors began an indepth  study  to  strengthen  both  the  effectiveness  of  the Group's  governance  and  the  Board's  independence,  by restructuring the balance of power within it.\n\nIt  concluded that following the transition period, the best course  of  action  for  the  Group  was  to  combine  the positions of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. In order to  enhance  the  balance  and  solidity  of  the  Board,  the Board  decided  to  recommend  that  the  Shareholders' Meeting  enshrine  the  obligation  to  appoint  a  Lead Independent  Director  with  enhanced  powers  in  the Company's  bylaws.  Provided  that  the  Shareholders' Meeting  approves  the  Board's  recommendations,  the proportion  of  independent  directors  on  the  Board  will increase from 73% to 82%.\n\nOn January 18, 2023, Compagnie de Saint-Gobain issued a \u20ac1.15 billion bond divided into two tranches:\n\n- \u00b7 a  \u20ac500  million  tranche  maturing  July  18,  2024  and paying  a  floating-rate  coupon  of  3-month  Euribor +0.20%;\n- \u00b7 a \u20ac650 million tranche maturing January 18, 2029 and paying a coupon of 3.5%.\n\nOn  November  29,  2023,  Compagnie  de  Saint-Gobain issued a \u20ac2 billion bond divided into two tranches:\n\n- \u00b7 a  \u20ac1  billion  tranche  maturing  November  29,  2026  and paying a coupon of 3.75%;\n- \u00b7 a  \u20ac1  billion  tranche  maturing  November  29,  2030  and paying a coupon of 3.875%.",

A copy may also  be  obtained  upon  request  from  the  clerk  of  the Commercial  Court  of  Nanterre  and  at  the  Company's headquarters.\n\n## Corporate name, form, head office and duration (Articles 1, 2, 4 and 5)\n\nA French soci\u00e9t\u00e9 anonyme governed by the provisions of Articles  L.  210-1  et  seq.  of  the  French  Commercial  Code, Compagnie  de  Saint -Gobain's head office is Tour Saint -Gobain, 12, place de l'Iris, 92400 Courbevoie, France (Tel.: +33 (0)1 88 54 00 00). It is registered with the Trade and  Companies  Register  of  Nanterre  under  No.  542  039 532.\n\nThe Company was founded in 1665 and registered with the Trade  and  Companies  Register  on  July  21,  1954,  for  a period that will expire on December 31, 2040, unless it is subject to early dissolution or extension.\n\n## Corporate purpose (Article 3)\n\nThe  Company's  summarized  corporate  purpose  is  to conduct  and  manage,  in  France  and  internationally,  any industrial,  commercial,  financial,  securities  and  real  estate transactions related to its manufacturing and contracting activities through French or foreign subsidiaries or equity interests or otherwise.\n\n## Fiscal year (Article 19)\n\nIts fiscal year runs from January 1 to December 31.\n\n## Share capital and disclosure thresholds (Articles 6 and 7)\n\nAs  of  December  31,  2023,  the  share  capital  was  set  at \u20ac2,025,752,048 divided into 506,438,012 shares with a par value of \u20ac4.00 each, entirely paid up and all of the same class.\n\nThe  bylaws  (Article  7.4)  require  shareholders  to  disclose to  the  Company  within  five  trading  days  any  direct, indirect or joint interest representing at least 0.50% of the share  capital  or  voting  rights,  or  any  multiple  of  this percentage.\n\nThe  same  disclosure  requirement  applies  when  a  direct, indirect  or  joint  equity  interest  falls  below  any  of  these thresholds.\n\nFailure to comply with these disclosure rules may result in the  undisclosed  shares  exceeding  this  percentage  being deprived of voting rights  for  a  period  of  two  years  from the  date  when  the  non-disclosure  is  remedied,  at  the request of one or more shareholders representing at least 3% of the share capital or voting rights, as recorded in the minutes of the General Meeting.\n\nFurthermore,  the  Company  may  request  information regarding  the  composition  of  its  shareholding  structure and the ownership of its shares in accordance with current laws and regulations.\n\n\u00cb\n\n## Share rights (Article 8)\n\nEach share entitles the owner to ownership of corporate assets and liquidation proceeds equal to the proportion of the share capital it represents.\n\nWhenever  it  is  necessary  to  own  a  certain  number  of shares to exercise a right, the owners who do not hold that number  must  arrange  for  the  pooling  of  the  required number of shares where appropriate.\n\nEach  share  entitles  the  holder  to  vote  at  the  General Meetings  under  the  conditions  stipulated  in  the  bylaws (see Article 18 below).\n\nOwnership of a share automatically entails acceptance of the  Company's  bylaws  and  the  decisions  of  the  General Meeting.\n\n## Company Management (Articles 9 to 12, 14 and 15)\n\nThe Company is administered by a Board of Directors of at  least  three  members  and  no  more  than  eighteen members, subject to the exceptions provided for by law in the event of a merger.\n\nDirectors  are  elected  for  a  four-year  term.  They  may  be reappointed subject to the age limit of 70. The age limit for  the  Chairman  of  the  Board  of  Directors  is  68.  The Chairman  of  the  Board  of  Directors  may  also  hold  the position of Chief Executive Officer of the Company at the discretion of the members of the Board. In this case, the Chairman  of  the  Board  of  Directors  has  the  title  of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and the age limit is 65 (like that of the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Operating Officers).\n\nOne  Director  representing  employee  shareholders  is appointed by the General Shareholders' Meeting under the conditions  of  quorum  and  majority  applicable  to  any appointment  of  a  Director  from  among  the  employee shareholders  or,  where  appropriate,  from  among  the members  of  the  Supervisory  Boards  of  the  corporate mutual fund(s) of the Company's Group Savings Plan. It is governed  by  all  the  laws  and  provisions  of  the  bylaws applicable  to  the  Directors  appointed  by  the  General Shareholders' Meeting as well as those specific to it.\n\n## Procedure for appointing candidates for the office of Director representing employee shareholders\n\nCandidates  for  the  office of Director representing employee  shareholders  are  presented  to  the  General Shareholders' Meeting as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 one  candidate  is  appointed  from  among  its  members by the Supervisory Board of the corporate mutual fund of the Company's Group Savings Plan. If there is more than  one  corporate  mutual  fund,  each  Supervisory Board  of  such  corporate  mutual  funds  appoints  one candidate from among its members;",

        "page_content": "- \u00b7 one  candidate  is  elected  by  the  employees  holding registered  shares  as  part  of  a  consultation  process defined  by  General  Management.  Voting  may  take place by any technical means that ensures the reliability of  the  vote,  whether  by  electronic  means  or  by  mail, with each employee holding a number of votes equal to the  number  of  registered  shares  they  hold.  The candidate  with  the  highest  number  of  votes  is presented to the General Shareholders' Meeting.\n\n## Election of the Director representing employee shareholders\n\nIf  there  is  more  than  one  candidate  for  the  office  of Director representing employee shareholders, the Board of Directors  may  approve  the  appointment  of  one  of  them. The  candidate  with  the  highest  number  of  votes  at  the General  Shareholders'  Meeting  is  appointed  Director representing employee shareholders.\n\nThe  Company's  Works  Council  ( Comit\u00e9  de  Groupe ) appoints two Employee Directors. Employee Directors are appointed within six months of the General Shareholders' Meeting.\n\nThe term of office of a Director ends at the conclusion of the  Ordinary  General  Meeting  called  to  approve  the financial statements for the previous fiscal year held in the calendar  year  during  which  this  Director's  term  expires. The duties of an Employee Director (including a Director representing  employee  shareholders)  also  end  if  the employment contract is terminated, as of the date of the termination, subject to intragroup transfer. If the conditions for application of the law are not met, the term of  office  of  the  Employee  Directors  (including  a  Director representing employee shareholders) ends upon completion  of  the  Board  meeting  that  confirms  the Company's exit from the scope of application of the law.\n\nThe Board of Directors determines the Company's overall business strategy and examines any issues relating to its proper functioning.\n\nThe activities of the Board of Directors are organized and led by its Chairman.\n\nBoard meetings may be held using videoconferencing or other interactive telecommunication technology under the conditions stated by law.\n\nEach  Director  appointed  by  the  General  Shareholders' Meeting  must  own  at  least  eight  hundred  shares,  except Employee Directors and the Director representing employee shareholders.\n\n## General Management (Articles 13 and 15)\n\nAt the discretion of the Board of Directors, the Company's General  Management is  assumed  either  by  the  Chairman of  the  Board  of  Directors,  in  this  case  in  the  capacity  of Chairman  and  Chief  Executive  Officer,  or  by  the  Chief Executive Officer.\n\nThe  Chief  Executive  Officer,  chosen  by  the  Board  of Directors,  whether  or  not  from  among  its  members,  is vested  with  the  broadest  authority  to  act  under  any circumstances  in  the  name  of  the  Company  within  the limits  of  the  corporate  purpose  and  subject  to  such powers  as  the  law  expressly  attributes  to  General Meetings and the Board of Directors. The Chief Executive Officer represents the Company in its relations with third parties.\n\n## General Meetings and voting rights (Article 18)\n\nAny  shareholder  may  participate  in  General  Meetings  in person or by proxy, provided that his/her/its shares have been  formally  recorded  in  the  accounts,  subject  to  the applicable legal provisions.\n\nAdditional information\n\nWhere  decided  by  the  Board  of  Directors,  shareholders may be convened to and vote at a General Meeting by any form  of  electronic  communication.  Any  shareholder  may be represented under the conditions provided for by law. Shareholding  legal  entities  are  represented  at  a  General Meeting  by  their  legal  representative  or  by  any  person designated by that legal representative for this purpose.\n\nAt  all  General  Meetings,  voting  rights  are  exercisable  by the beneficial owner of the shares. Each shareholder has a number of voting rights corresponding to the number of shares held, without limitation.\n\nHowever, double voting rights are allocated to fully paidup shares registered in the name of the same shareholder for at least two years.\n\nIn  addition,  in  the  case  of  a  capital  increase  through capitalization  of  reserves,  profits  or  share  premiums, registered shares allocated free of charge to a shareholder carry double voting rights from the date on which they are issued  on  the  basis  of  shares  already  held  by  the shareholder carrying such entitlement.\n\nDouble  voting  rights  are  forfeited  when  the  shares  are converted to bearer form or sold. However, double voting rights are not forfeited when title is transferred by way of an  inheritance  or  as  a  result  of  the  liquidation  of  the marital estate or an inter vivos donation to a spouse or a relative in the direct line of succession. The transfer is not considered in calculating the qualifying period indicated in the preceding paragraph.\n\nShareholders  may  vote  by  mail  in  accordance  with applicable laws and regulations.\n\n## Allocation and appropriation of net income (Article 20)\n\nAn appropriation of at least five percent is deducted from net  income,  less  any  losses  carried  forward  from  the previous year, and  allocated to the reserve fund prescribed  by  law.  This  appropriation  is  no  longer mandatory once the reserve fund reaches a sum equal to one  tenth  of  the  share  capital.

These consultations assist in developing the Group's CSR reporting and communications.\n\n## A - Reference bases\n\nSaint -Gobain's main reports include social, environmental, health  and  safety,  and  responsible  purchasing  indicators. Each of these reports and the associated indicators have been  drawn  up  in  accordance  with  the  United  Nations Global Compact and applicable French legislation.\n\nIn  order  to  have  a  global  reference  framework,  these standards  are  also  based  on  indicators  from  the  GRI\n\n(Global  Reporting  Initiative),  SASB  or  other  relevant standards depending on materiality issues.\n\nThe  choice  of  indicators  is  defined  in  a  logic  of  time stability  and  information  availability.  The  description  and calculation  rules  of  indicators  defined  in  the  Group's governance documents are available for the teams of the different countries in French and in English.\n\n## B - Scope\n\n## a. The social reporting includes both qualitative and quantitative data on personnel and social issues\n\nCompared  to  the  scope  of  financial  consolidation,  the scope  of  consolidation  of  CSR  data  in  this  report  is composed  of  fully consolidated companies. Newly consolidated companies are accounted for at the rate of their financial integration, with a maximum grace period of two  years,  and  companies  sold  during  the  year  are  not taken  into  account.  An  entity  integrated  in  the  reporting before the maximum period remains integrated until it is disposed of.\n\nSocial data from the Smart'R tool is collected either manually or automatically as follows:\n\n| Type of collection                                                               | Frequency   | Structure   | Content                                                                               |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Social data (IT interface)                                                       | Monthly     | 93.5%       | Basic data on employees, hours and salary costs.

Absenteeism  rate  is therefore calculated over a more limited scope than that of the annual social reporting campaign.\n\nSome  countries  were  excluded  from  the  calculation  of these  indicators  because  of  the  lack  of  data  for  diverse reasons (no interface, priority application of local regulations  over  global  definition,  etc.).  The  following countries  are  concerned  by  this  exclusion:  the  United Sates,  Canada,  Ireland  and  Switzerland,  as  well  as  non-\n\n\u00cb\n\ninterfaced  entities  with  a  workforce  of  less  than  500 employees.\n\nAbsenteeism  rate  is  expressed  as  a  percentage  and corresponds to the total number of hours of absence over the total number of theoretical working hours. The reasons for  absences  taken  into  account  in  this  indicator  are absences  for  illness,  absences  relating  to  occupational accidents (including traveling to and from work), absences due  to  strikes  and  unjustified  absences.  Authorized  or anticipated absences (e.g. annual leave, family events) are not included in this indicator.",

        "page_content": "The  temporary  employment  rate  is  expressed  as  a percentage and corresponds to the total number of hours worked by temporary employees out of the total number of hours  worked  by  Saint-Gobain's  employees  and temporary  workers.  Temporary  employment  does  not include subcontractors and service providers.\n\nDespite  the  entities  excluded  from  the  scope,  the  Group retains  sufficient  coverage  in  terms  of  the  workforce  to enable the reporting of relevant indicators.\n\n## Headcount movements\n\nSome  newly  integrated  entities  have  been  interfaced during  the  year  and  the  headcount  movements  related data  is  therefore  incomplete.  In  this  case,  the  KPIs  using the  concerned  data  are  calculated  based  on  a  more restricted  perimeter  than  the  one  of  the  annual  social campaign.  As  an  example,  data  of  Kaycan  or  Building products  of  Canada  have  not  been  included  in  the calculation of hiring, departures or turnover until July 2023 (IT automation).\n\n## Training indicators\n\nThe  scope  is  that  of  the  Smart'R  entities  interfaced  with payroll  excluding  Russian  entities,  i.e.,  92.3%  of  the  total workforce.\n\nThe  indicator  includes  all  employees  trained  during  the year  (including  those  who  left  during  the  year)  reported on the number of employees at December 31, 2023.\n\n## b.  Environmental, health, and safety reporting is organized around three questionnaires with different scopes and frequencies\n\nThe scope of consolidation for environmental, health, and safety  data  includes  all  fully  consolidated  companies. Newly  consolidated  companies  are  accounted  for  at  the rate  of  their  financial  integration,  with  a  maximum  grace period of two years, and companies sold during the year are  not  taken  into  account.  An  entity  integrated  in  the reporting before the maximum period remains integrated until it is disposed of. In 2023, data from entities acquired in  2022  or  2023,  such  as  Kaycan,  Building  product  of canada or Clipso, are excluded from reporting.\n\nCSR information\n\nSome  questionnaires  being  specific  to  one  or  several categories  of  establishments,  the  scope  can  be  more  or less wide.\n\n- \u00b7 Safety:  makes  it  possible  to  summarize  all  accidents with  and  without  lost  time  of  employees,  temporary workers  and  permanent  subcontractors.  Among  these events,  those  that  result  in  an  injury  with  serious consequences  (HCI  High  Consequence  Injury)  are tagged in the reporting system. The definition of these HCI is based on that of the GRI (2018), GRI 403: health and safety at work: harm resulting from an event which results in death or injury from which the person cannot recover, or does not recover , or who is not expected to fully  recover  and  return  to  their  pre-accident  state  of health  even  after  6  months.  The  calculation  of  the frequency  rate  is  specified  by  an  internal  benchmark which  excludes  certain  accidents  taking  place  in  the workplace  but  not  directly  linked  to  the  workstation. The questionnaire includes all Group companies, which are  reported  to  sites,  agencies  or  offices  grouping nodes.  For  example,  an  entity  that  produces  both boards  and  plaster  will  report  data  under  a  single group.\n- \u00b7 Industrial  Hygiene  &  Health:  allows  for  the  results  of internal  audits,  the  follow-up  of  health  programs, certifications,  etc.  to  be  included.  The  questionnaire concerns all group companies by site grouping node.\n- \u00b7 Environment: enables the collection of all data relating to  production,  raw  materials,  energy,  atmospheric emissions,  water,  etc.  It  concerns  sites  with  significant impacts  on  the  environment,  such  as  industrial  sites, mines  and  quarries,  and  also  includes  in  2023 distribution  activities  in  France,  the  Nordic  and  Baltic countries and Switzerland, Concerning specific data on Scope 1 & 2 emissions, data from all production sites of fully integrated JVs have been included, even when the Group  does  not  have  operational  management,  and since they are material.\n- \u00b7 Financial  data  related  to  the  environment,  health,  and safety  (expenditure  and  investments)  concern  all  the group's entities. They have been tracked in the SIF, the Group's  financial  reporting  tool  since  the  2013  fiscal year.\n\nThe safety and environment reporting data is entered directly in the EHS reporting system, called Ga\u00efa, for all EHS entities. The various questionnaires sent, as well as their frequency, scope of reporting and content, are shown in the following table:\n\n| Questionnaire                   | Frequency   | Structure                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Content                                                                                    |\n|---------------------------------|-------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Safety-on-Line                  | When needed | World, all categories of victims                                                                                                                                                                           | Instant alert in case of work-related accident  with or without work stoppage, fatal       |\n| Environment-on-Line When needed |             | World, environmental events                                                                                                                                                                                | Instant alert in case of major or significant  environmental accidents                     |\n| Safety                          | Monthly     | World, all categories of employees                                                                                                                                                                         | Accidents, numbers of days lost, worked  hours, etc.                                       |\n| General & Health                | Annual      | World (all entities except certain offices  or attached sites)                                                                                                                                             | Certification, audit results, monitoring  of health programs, etc.                         |\n| Environment                     | Annual      | 'Environmental concerned scope' sites +  mines and quarries (excluding sites  connected to plants) + other sites  at the region's initiative + Distribution agencies, transportation fleet  and warehouses | Output, raw materials, energy, atmospheric  emissions, water, waste, mitigation plan, etc. |\n\n<!-- image -->",

All  suppliers  in  these categories  which  carry  out  transactions  with  Group companies are covered by the reporting.\n\nThe scope of 'trade' suppliers is composed as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 European partners: strategic suppliers with a European framework contract. These suppliers represent 50% of total purchases;\n- \u00b7 main  suppliers:  annual  transactions  of  over  \u20ac3  million. These suppliers  -  mainly  in  France,  Norway,  Denmark, Sweden  and  the  United  Kingdom  -  account  for  more than 82% of the total purchases of trading companies;\n- \u00b7 own  brands: suppliers with whom  Saint -Gobain Sourcing (India and China) develops products marketed  under  a  Group  brand.  Limited  share  of  the Group's total purchases.\n\nThe  scope  of  'non-trade'  suppliers  considered  in  the indicators  is  made  up  of  suppliers  with  annual  purchases of more than \u20ac100,000 which have not been subject to an exemption (supplier owned by a State government or in a sole  sourcing  position)  and  which  do  not  concern expenses  related  to  sectors  of  activity  not  managed  by the Purchasing function (banks, insurance, legal services). This  scope  represents  80%  of  the  total  expenses  of  the Group's non-trade scope.\n\n## C - Data consolidation\n\n## a.  Social reporting\n\nSocial  reporting  is  mainly  composed  of  Smart'R  data. Depending  on  the  type  of  data,  the  data  is  reported monthly or annually. The process of data consolidation for the social reporting involves three steps:\n\n- \u00b7 The data is entered into the tool monthly by interface (93.5% of the workforce) or manually via questionnaires for other entities (6.5% of the workforce);\n- \u00b7 The  reporting  is  enriched  by  annual  social  data gathered  by  questionnaires  such  as  the  number  of signed agreements in effect, etc.;\n- \u00b7 Information is made more reliable by the Social Affairs Direction.\n\nThe  environmental,  health, and  safety reporting is powered  by  the  Ga\u00efa  tool.  Each  of  the  questionnaires  is manually typed into the tool. Information may be reported monthly (e.g., safety) or annually (e.g., industrial hygiene, and health and environment). The process for consolidating  EHS  reporting  data  is  similar  to  that  for social  reporting,  where  the  data  is  entered  and  then verified and consolidated by the Group's EHS Department.\n\n## b.  CO2 emissions evaluation\n\nEnvironmental, health and safety reporting is powered by the  Ga\u00efa  tool.  Each  of  the  questionnaires  is  entered manually  into  the  tool  except  for  data  related  to  CO2 emissions ('scopes' 1 and 2) for certain sites. Information feedback  can  be  monthly  (e.g.  safety)  or  annual  (e.g. industrial hygiene & health and environment). The process of  consolidating  EHS  reporting  data  is  similar  to  that  of social  reporting  where  the  data  is  entered  then  verified and consolidated by the Group's EHS Department.\n\n- \u00b7 Automation of scope 1 & 2 data collection :\n\nSince 2022, the Group has developed automated reporting of its scope 1 and 2 carbon emissions. At the end of 2023, nearly  90%  of  the  group's  emissions  are  reported  on  a\n\n\u00cb\n\nmonthly basis directly from the local information systems and ERPs to a central datalake.\n\nEnergy  and  raw  materials  emitting  CO2:  The  annual cumulative consumption feeds the Gaia reporting tool. For sites whose  information  system  is  not  connected, consumption is entered annually like the other indicators of the environment campaign\n\nCarbon-free  energy:  All  carbon-free  electricity  purchase contracts  are  centralized  in  an  internal  tool  allowing allocation by site.\n\nEmission  factors:  all  emission  factors  are  centralized  in  a single database for the Group. They are standard for the entire  Group,  except  for  certain  entities  subject  to supporting documents.\n\n- \u00b7 Evaluation of CO2 Emissions\n- To evaluate its CO2 emissions, the Group applies the GHG protocol standard.\n\n'Scope'  2:  The  'scope'  2  emission  calculations  were carried out using a market-based methodology\n\nFollowing  the  Greenhouse  Gas  protocol,  the  emission factors for electricity come from certified sources from the suppliers'  own  certificates  or  from  recognized  bases  (for example, the IEA).\n\nFor  countries  where  data  is  not  available,  the  emission factors  used  are  defined  by  the  environment  team.  In particular, for the majority of European countries, the IAE country  emission  factors  have  been  used.  In  order  to quantify  the  differences  between  the  methodology  used by Saint -Gobain and the one using only the AIB 'residual mix' emission factors, a sensitivity analysis was carried out on the 2022 data and the difference observed represents less than 15% for Scope 2 and less than 2% for Scope 1+2.\n\n## c.  Responsible purchasing reporting\n\nResponsible  purchasing  reporting  is  powered  by  the Nazare tool by compiling document reviews and audits of trade and non-trade suppliers. The data is aggregated and reviewed by the Group's Purchasing teams.\n\n## D - The Group's objectives\n\nThe Group has set targets for 2025, based on 2010 results, and targets for 2030, based on 2017 results.\n\n## a.  2010-2025 iso-production objectives\n\nThe  Group  has  set  medium-term  objectives,  up  to  2025, based  on  the  2010  results.  They  are  established  using comparable production for three-year periods. This means, for  instance,  that  2023-2025  emissions  and  consumption are recalculated based on 2022 production.\n\nBased on the results from the baseline year for the threeyear  period,  the  Group  updates  every  three  years  the scope for which environmental results are tracked for the following  three  years  (2011-2013/2014-2016/2017-2019/ 2020-2022/2023-2025).\n\nThe  published  results  for  each  scope  therefore  have  a comparable scope for the three years within the period: sites closed or sold are removed from current year and baseline year,  but  no  acquisition  is  taken  into  account.  They  are included in the subsequent period. The achievement of the iso-production objectives will therefore take into account the contribution  of  sites  that  opened  or  closed  between  2010 and 2025 in one (or more) of the five periods considered.",

Targets 2017-2030, in absolute terms\n\nThe Group has also set objectives for 2030 based on the results of 2017, including Continental for targets related to CO2  emissions,  water  withdrawals,  avoided  virgin  raw materials  and  non-recovered  waste.  They  are  defined  in absolute value, for the entire Group.\n\n## E - Limitations encountered\n\nAs the Group operates in a variety of countries, a doctrine detailing  the  calculation  method  for  each  indicator  is distributed to the contributors every year for the various reporting  systems.  However,  despite  the  doctrine,  it  is sometimes  possible  that  the  indicators  are  interpreted\n\nCSR information\n\ndifferently  depending  on  the  local  context  (national legislation or practices).\n\nThe  Group  remains  vigilant  with  regard  to  distortions between  countries  that  may  arise  in  the  understanding  of indicators  and  may  be  led  to  exclude  from  the  scope  of reporting entities with excessive differences in understanding.\n\nIn addition, the reporting process means that some entities are  not  interfaced  or  have  difficulty  presenting  the necessary  data.  The  Group  remains  attentive  to  the reliability of the information and ensures that the coverage for each  reporting  is  sufficient  to  present  reliable indicators.\n\nAs payroll closing dates may differ from one country to the other,  some  social  reporting  indicators  are  only  calculated on  a  12-month  rolling  basis  in  order  to  smooth  out  any timing differences due to these different closing dates.\n\n<!-- image -->",

It is the result of a consultation with the Group's  internal  stakeholders  and  it  takes  into  account Saint -Gobain's new organization, effective as of January 1, 2019. It presents the Group's sustainable growth generation process through its key resources and its main pillars of value creation.\n\n## CSR risk and opportunity analysis\n\nSaint -Gobain  has  conducted  its  study  of  the  risks  and opportunities  related  to  Corporate  Social  Responsibility (CSR)  within  the  framework  of  the  priority  challenges presented  in  the  materiality  analysis  (see  section  1.2.3, p. 13).\n\nAs a result, a universe of the 15 most important CSR risks and opportunities for Saint -Gobain was built by factoring in  the  Group's  strategy,  its  objectives  and  operations  as well as  its main  environmental,  social  and  societal challenges.  In  an  effort  to  harmonize  the  vocabulary  and the vision on these challenges, a table presenting a risk or an opportunity's definition, as well as the potential impacts\n\n\u00cb\n\nfor stakeholders on the one hand and for Saint -Gobain on the other hand, has been provided.\n\nThese risks  and  opportunities  were  then  rated  according to stakeholders' expectations in order to combine internal and external visions of the organization, according to the methodology shared with internal audit and control. While the  risk  assessment  methodology  follows  the  process developed  by  the  internal  control,  the  value  scales  have been adjusted according to non-financial impacts and to a long-term  time  frame.  The  interviews  were  conducted from May to September 2018 with two assessment criteria: impact and criticality. Members  of the Executive Committee participated in these evaluations.\n\nNine  CSR  risks  and  opportunities  were  identified  as  the most important:\n\n- \u00b7 Diversity within the organization and inclusion;\n- \u00b7 Energy efficiency and carbon intensity of operations;\n- \u00b7 Business ethics;\n- \u00b7 Management of skills and talents;\n- \u00b7 Responsible supply chain management;\n- \u00b7 Integration of recycled materials;\n- \u00b7 Energy  and  carbon  performance  of  products  and services;\n- \u00b7 Health and safety at work;\n- \u00b7 Product safety.\n\nThe  identification  of  these  risks  is  a  key  step  in  the construction of the Group's CSR roadmap (see section 3.3.3.B, p. 120).",

Manufacture  of  energy-efficient  equipment  for  the  buildings. Activity  3.5  directly  covers  several  Saint -Gobain product categories, including insulation, glazing for external fa\u00e7ades (windows), plasterboard and mortars that are part of an insulation system;\n- \u00b7 3.6.  Other manufacturing technologies with low carbon intensity. Activity  3.6  concerns  Saint -Gobain products and solutions  contributing  to  substantial  reduction  (compared  to  the  most  efficient  alternative  on  the  market)  of  GHG emissions generated by the product or by the manufacturing process to which they contribute. This especially includes activities in ceramics, mobility, construction chemicals, or the construction industry. Some building material systems that promote lightweight construction are also included.\n- \u00b7 Saint-Gobain has no eligible activity  under  the  new  Aquatic  Resources,  Circular  Economy,  Pollution  Prevention  and Reduction, Biodiversity and Ecosystems criteria.\n\n## Alignment of activities\n\nFor all so-called eligible activities, Saint -Gobain has identified the applicable technical criteria as well as the corresponding performance thresholds:\n\n- \u00b7 for the activities referenced in category 3.5, technical criteria and corresponding performance thresholds have been defined by the regulation;\n- \u00b7 for the activities referenced in category 3.6, in the absence of technical criteria and performance thresholds defined by the  regulation,  these  have  been  identified  and  assessed  by  comparing  the  benefits  and  performance  with  standard products or solutions on the market as required by regulations. Saint -Gobain relied in particular on life cycle analyzes in accordance  with  reference  standards  (ISO,  PEF)  and  assessed  the  thresholds  to  define  a  substantial  reduction according to sectors and product families.\n\nSaint -Gobain's  ambition  is  to  offer  solutions  that  combine  performance  and  sustainability  in  order  to  meet  the expectations of its stakeholders, especially its clients, and to enable the acceleration towards a more sustainable and lowcarbon economy (see section 2.1.1.B, p. 66). A standard method for evaluating the benefits of these solutions was defined in 2020 and deployed in the organization. The benefits in terms of contributing to the fight against climate change are integrated into the approach. This standard profit measurement method has been audited by an independent third party and published on the Group's website. Saint -Gobain relied on this method to measure the alignment of product lines for the activities referenced in category 3.6.\n\nThis exercise requires carrying out complex studies on the comparative performance of products and solutions, some of which, given their complexity, will have to be continued during 2024.\n\nThe work carried out also included verification of compliance with the minimum guarantees (see section 2.3.1, p. 78 and table 9.3.4 , p. 423), as well as the analysis of compliance with the criteria of 'Do no significant harm' (DNSH) based on its existing policies and its risk management system. More specifically for DNSHs:\n\n- \u00b7 adaptation to climate change, see section 3.3.2.B.a, p. 99 and section 3.3, p. 106;\n- \u00b7 water policies, see section 3.4.2.C, p. 127;\n- \u00b7 pollution, see section 3.2.2.C, p. 101;\n- \u00b7 circular economy, see section 3.2.2.C.c, p. 101 and section 3.4, p. 124;\n- \u00b7 Biodiversity, see section 3.2.2.C.c, p. 101.",

Saint-Gobain  is  however  studying  the  possible integration within activity 3.9 Manufacturing of cast iron and steel. As the interpretation is not sufficiently advanced, they have not been integrated into the tables in 2023. They will be considered for the following years. The associated turnover is of the order of 1.1 billion euros, which represents 2% of the group's consolidated turnover.\n\n<!-- image -->",
