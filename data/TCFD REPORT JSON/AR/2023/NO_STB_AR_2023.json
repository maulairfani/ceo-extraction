Ap/fiendix\n\n## Foreword by our CEO\n\nStorebrand increased its results in 2023 in a world characterised by rising con/flict levels, extreme weather and in/flation. We earned the trust of an increasing number of customers in both private and commercial markets. We also took new steps as a responsible corporate citizen.\n\n## Odd Arild Grefstad Group Chief Executive O/fficer\n\nWhile the war in Ukraine continued, a new round of the long-running Israeli-Palestinian con/flict broke out, both having wide-ranging and deadly impact on civilian populations. Continued high in/flation and rising interest rates throughout the year caused increased /financial strain on households and many businesses in the Nordic market. Our pro/ficient employees stayed close to our customers in these uncertain conditions, assisting private individuals and business leaders with advice on savings and investment opportunities.\n\nI am pleased that an increasing number of customers chose Storebrand's products and services within pensions, savings, insurance, banking, and asset management in 2023. Kron and Danica, which were integrated into the Group in 2023 following acquisitions the previous year, contributed to this. During the year, we strengthened our position as a proactive challenger in the Norwegian retail market with strong developments in banking, savings, and insurance.\n\nOur deep roots, which date back to 1767, have given Storebrand a solid foundation in our markets. We have long-term relationships and bene/fit from signi/ficant customer trust. In Norway we are the market leader in occupational pensions, and we also have achieved an increasingly solid position in Sweden. In addition, we are Norway's largest private asset manager with more than NOK 1,200 billion under management. We work ambitiously and purposefully to create long-term value for both customers and owners.\n\nOur core mission is to secure our customers when accidents happen and ensure that their savings grow so that they can live the lives they want. For our retail customers, Storebrand provides a safety net beyond public welfare schemes. In the corporate market, we make it possible for businesses to take risks, develop their business, attract employees, and create value for both owners and employees. Our goal is to be close to our customers and make it easy for them to make good choices for the future. As in previous years, our customers ranked Storebrand as the best supplier of occupational pensions in 2023. We work hard every day to maintain and build customer loyalty in all segments.\n\nIn 2023, the world was exposed to numerous and severe climate-related events, including /floods, forest /fires and droughts. We must be prepared for extreme weather to become the new normal, also within the Nordic region. In Norway, the storm 'Hans' caused major damage to many people and resulted in large payouts from insurance companies. Working together with customers and other industry players to prevent injury and property damage, is becoming more important. Increasingly, we also assess climate risk as part of our investment decisions.\n\nDuring 2023, we strengthened our e/fforts to integrate sustainability into our strategy, governance structures and culture. This work will continue in 2024. Storebrand is recognised for our sustainability work over many years. The /field of sustainability is changing rapidly and is subject to many regulations. Ensuring lasting progress in this area requires deep expertise and systematic work, over time.",

Ap/fiendix\n\nWe will continue to invest in companies that contribute to solving the UN Sustainable Development Goals. Going forward, we will strengthen our e/fforts to reverse the trend of increasing disability and exclusion in society, a topic we worked extensively on in 2023 as well.\n\nTechnology and digitalisation played a signi/ficant role in both society and business in 2023. Arti/ficial intelligence (AI) became more accessible and was applied by people and enterprises in an increasing number of areas. At Storebrand, we have long used advanced machine learning to, among other things, optimise risk pricing, detect insurance fraud, and strengthen customer relationships. Going forward, the  use of AI will provide many new opportunities to streamline and further improve both work processes and customer services. As we try out new applications for AI, our customers should be con/fident that we are using the new technologies responsibly.\n\nFor the /first time in three years, we invited owners, analysts, and other interested parties to a full Capital\n\nMarkets Day in 2023. Here we presented Storebrand's business, growth strategy and /financial ambitions.  Going forward, the Group will prioritise pro/fitable and scalable growth. In both the private and corporate markets, we see a great potential to increase sales across our product areas. Customers who use several of our products and services are the most satis/fied and loyal. Increasing the proportion of customers who have broad relationships with Storebrand will help ensure future-oriented and robust operations. As a result of higher interest rates, we announced at the Capital Markets Day increased targets for return on equity, pro/fit development and distribution of capital to our owners going forward.\n\nStorebrand's organisation is well equipped for 2024. We place great emphasis on further developing our own employees and succeed in attracting new, skilled people with di/fferent backgrounds and expertise. Together, we will continue to work to deliver good customer experiences and market-leading returns to customers and owners.",

Director's Report\n\nSustainability Report\n\n- 3. Shareholder matters\n- 4. Annual Accounts and Notes\n- 5. Ap/fiendix\n\n## Foreword by the Chair\n\nStorebrand proved resilient in a year characterised by serious climate-related events, geopolitical unrest, challenging economic times and technological advances. The Board is very satis/fied with the company's ability to continuously adapt operations and at the same time ensure good returns for customers.\n\n## Didrik Munch Chair, Storebrand ASA\n\nSolid results and active risk management ensured good returns and led to a solvency ratio of 192 per cent at the end of the fourth quarter of 2023, up a total of 8 percentage points from the same time in 2022. Therefore, we maintained our ambition to pay increasing nominal dividends to our owners. In addition, we increased our share buy-back ambition to NOK 1.5 billion annually and NOK 12 billion by the end of 2030.\n\nAt the Capital Markets Day 2023, Storebrand presented new /financial ambitions based on structural growth and increased earnings from its guaranteed pension business. Higher interest rates also contribute positively to the company's earning capacity through increased /financial results. The Board of Directors raised the Group's pro/fit ambition, targeting a cash result before tax and amortisation of NOK 5 billion in 2025. The target for the Group's return on equity was increased from 10 per cent to more than 14 per cent.\n\nIt was inspiring to see that Storebrand managed to defend a market-leading position within occupational pensions in 2023, while at the same time increasing market shares in areas where the Group has a challenger position. With good competitiveness and a presence in markets with high underlying growth, Storebrand also has a solid foundation for high value creation going forward. In recent years, Storebrand has worked to gradually replace guaranteed pension schemes with less capital-intensive activities. As a result, Storebrand has evolved from being a Norwegian supplier of traditional de/fined bene/fit pensions to a broad /financial Group o/ffering insurance products, de/fined contribution pensions, savings and investment solutions and asset management throughout the Nordic region.\n\nStorebrand maintained its position as the fourth largest asset manager in the Nordic region in 2023. Total assets increased to record levels in 2023 and totalled NOK 1,212 billion at the end of the fourth quarter, up by NOK 192 billion in 2023. About half of the pension assets under management, and 75 per cent of total assets, consist of non-guaranteed savings. The retail market was a strong contributor to the Group's growth in 2023 as the year\n\nbefore, with solid developments in both banking and insurance despite large payments related to weatherrelated injuries and disability.\n\nAgain, Storebrand delivered high absolute returns on managed De/fined Contribution pension in 2023. In the last three and last /five years, we have also achieved the best returns in the market for our core product occupational pensions, for both the high equity and the moderate equity content pro/files. The results give us signi/ficant competitive advantages in an important growth area. In our Swedish business SPP, we achieved 24 per cent growth in premium income in 2023. This strengthened the basis for investments in further business development. Storebrand is the market leader in de/finedcontribution pensions in Norway with a market share of 30 per cent, and the biggest challenger in Sweden with a market share of 16 per cent.\n\nThe businesses of Kron and Danica, acquired by Storebrand in 2022, were fully integrated into the Group in 2023. With Danica, we strengthened our distribution power and presence within occupational pensions in the market for small and medium-sized enterprises, in addition to strengthening our personal risk o/ffering. Kron, our new digital savings and investment service, was ranked as number one in the EPSI 2023 customer satisfaction survey. Several other surveys also showed that we were among the very best in several customer segments in the commercial market. The respondents particularly emphasised the competence of Storebrand's advisors, the quality of digital solutions and our ability to follow up the corporate customer employees. Storebrand again won all tender processes related to occupational pensions in the public sector and has won contracts worth more than NOK 20 billion over the past four years.\n\nThe Board is very pleased with Storebrand's ability to navigate through challenging waters. With good results in 2023, the Group strengthened its foundation for future value creation and to deliver on ambitious growth and pro/fitability targets for both 2024 and 2025.",

The Group intends to maintain a strong solvency and a balance adapted to the risk in its operations. The threshold for overcapitalisation is a solvency ratio exceeding 175 per cent. When the Group is above 175 per cent the ambition is to repay signi/ficant portions of this capital to shareholders through buyback programs. In 2023, the buyback program was continued, resulting in NOK 1.5 billion in share buybacks, equivalent to approx. 4 per cent of outstanding shares. The ambition is to return approx. NOK 1.5 billion annually via share buybacks through 2030, amounting to a total of NOK 12 billion. At the same time, the Group expects additional capital to be available for further growth or distribution to shareholders.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Shareholder matters\n- 4. Annual Accounts and Notes\n- 5. Ap/fiendix\n\n## Strategic highlights 2023\n\n2023 was characterised by geopolitical tension, war and market turbulence. Simultaneously, high in/flation persisted, and the central banks raised interest rates eight times in Norway, and four hikes in Sweden. Despite these factors a/ffecting Storebrand, the company demonstrated resilience and adaptability. Through a combination of dynamic risk management and a diversi/fied business model, Storebrand achieved a positive result development and strengthened its solvency position. Underlying growth was robust across all business areas, and higher interest rates had a positive impact on the company portfolios return. During the 2020 Capital Markets Day, ambitious growth and margin goals were set, and in 2023, Storebrand delivered on these objectives across all business areas except Insurance. 2023 proved to be a challenging year for Insurance due to extraordinary weather conditions, increased disability claims and persistently high in/flation.\n\nFollowing a strategic review of the ownership in Storebrand Helseforsikring AS, Storebrand decided to sell its 50 per cent stake in Storebrand Helseforsikring AS to joint-venture partner ERGO International AG. Storebrand will continue to distribute health insurance in the Norwegian and Swedish markets through a distribution agreement with Ergo. The transaction is expected to take place during the /first half of 2024, with an estimated positive impact on results of approximately NOK 1.1 billion.\n\nBelow is a review of strategic highlights for 2023 for the various elements that constitute Storebrand's Group strategy.\n\nGrowth in capital-light business areas in the front book\n\n## (A) Leading provider of occupational pensions in Norway and Sweden\n\nThe core of Storebrand's strategy is to gather and manage savings from pension and institutional customers in Norway and Sweden, as well as retail customers in Norway. In 2023, the Group maintained its leading position as provider of De/fined Contribution pension schemes with a market share of 30 per cent in Norway and 16 per cent in Sweden. 2) Due to solid market returns,\n\nimproved new sales and strong underlying growth, assets under management in Unit Linked increased to NOK 380 billion. This corresponds to a growth of 20 per cent compared with last year. Since 2012, assets under management in Unit Linked have grown by 18 per cent annually. The structural growth in De/fined Contribution pension schemes contributed to net transfers of NOK 15.4 billion in new capital during the year. 3) The Norwegian business completed the integration of the Danica business acquired in 2022, an important milestone in terms of strengthening the presence in the SME segment. The Swedish business SPP had strong new sales development during 2023 leading to a market leading 24 per cent of sales in De/fined Contribution pensions.\n\n## Assets under Management, Unit Linked, NOK billion\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2023 was a year with strong absolute returns for Norwegian De/fined Contribution pension customers in Storebrand's standard pro/files. Equities and bonds contributed positively to the returns, whilst the contribution from real estate was negative for the year.\n\nStorebrand's largest and most common investment pro/files, high and moderate equity content, both delivered high absolute returns in 2023. Over the past 3 and 5 years, Storebrand has delivered the strongest returns in the market at 5.5 per cent and 8.0 per cent for high equity content, respectively, and 8.2 per cent and 11.0 per cent for moderate equity content 4) . For pension customers with guaranteed returns, Storebrand's dynamic and risk-adjusted management ensured that despite volatile /financial markets throughout the year, the Group was able to book the guaranteed return.\n\n- 4) Return based on comparable investment pro/files with balanced risk (approx. 50% equity share) and high risk (approx. 80% equity share) within an active de/fined-contribution pension scheme.

Two tender processes were completed in 2023, and both contracts were awarded to Storebrand. Storebrand has argued for an increasing number of tender processes in this market and seeks clari/fication on the lack of tender processes. The EFTA Surveillance Authority (ESA) is expected to clarify in 2024 whether the procurement of pension services is subject to tender in the public sector (read more under the section 'Regulatory changes'). The Group has also continued to take over the management of corporate pension funds, resulting in an additional NOK 3.2 billion in assets under management transferred in 2023.\n\n## (B) Nordic Powerhouse in asset management\n\nStorebrand is the fourth largest asset manager in the Nordic region, 5) and total assets under management are\n\n## Assets under management, NOK billion\n\n## Change in assets under management, NOK billion\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n5) Source: AMWatch Q3 2023\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nthe Group's most important revenue driver. Storebrand further strengthened its position in 2023 through strong growth in assets under management.\n\nStorebrand Asset Management aims to be a Nordic asset management powerhouse by taking three market positions: being a local Nordic partner, the gateway to the Nordic region for foreign investors and a pioneer in sustainable investments. At the end of the year, Storebrand managed a total of NOK 1 212 billion, of which 51 per cent was on behalf of pension customers and 49 per cent was on behalf of external customers. The increase in total assets under management of 19 per cent was due to both positive contributions from /financial markets and net in/flows for the year of NOK 70 billion. Since 2012, the assets under management have grown by 10 per cent annually through a combination of customer growth, market returns and acquired business.",

Ap/fiendix\n\n## Insurance portfolio premiums, NOK billion\n\n## Bank lendning balance, NOK billion\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDuring the year, the position as a local Nordic partner was strengthened. With a wide range of long-term investment strategies, Storebrand succeeded in attracting new customers in a highly competitive market. In Sweden, Storebrand had the second highest net in/flow. In Denmark, total assets under management have more than quintupled since Storebrand actively started investing there in 2020.\n\nInternational investors continued to show strong demand for Storebrand's alternative investment and ESG fund o/fferings in 2023. Private equity /firm Cubera, which was acquired by Storebrand in 2019, continued to raise capital in its new fund in 2023, and the fund now stands at approximately EURO 700 million. To strengthen the distribution of funds in the international market, several new funds were launched on the Asset Management Exchange (AMX) in Ireland. The platform has prompted a number of British pension funds to consider Storebrand as an asset manager.\n\nThe Group also took further steps to consolidate its position as a world leader in sustainable investments. Storebrand has a lot of in/fluence through its investments. The ambition is to reduce the carbon footprint of companies Storebrand invest in by 32 per cent by 2025. We will achieve this by in/fluencing companies to reduce their emissions. Storebrand conducts talks at senior management level with the 20 companies that account for the largest emissions in the Group's investments.\n\nAt the end of the year, Storebrand managed NOK 569 billion in fossil-free funds and NOK 155 billion in what we call solutions. Solutions are either investments in companies that we believe contribute to sustainable development and achieving the UN Sustainable Development Goals, or investments in green bonds, environmentally certi/fied real estate and green infrastructure.\n\n## (C) Growing challenger in the Norwegian retail market\n\nStorebrand maintains strong growth momentum, increasing market shares in the Norwegian retail market for banking and insurance services. This is becoming an\n\nincreasingly important business area as pensions and savings individualise.\n\nDue to our corporate pensions and asset management o/ffering, Storebrand has systems and solutions that ensure a solid foundation for delivering savings and insurance products in the retail market. Together with the bank, Storebrand o/ffers fully digital distribution with integrated value propositions for cross-selling between savings, insurance and banking.\n\nWith 257 years of history, the brand name Storebrand is strong. In Norway, 1.7 million people are customers of Storebrand through its bank and insurance, investments and pension schemes. These customers are our main target group for additional /financial services that may enable them to achieve greater /financial security and wellness.\n\nStrengthened distribution capabilities and strong demand in the retail market contributed to continued strong growth in 2023. Portfolio premiums in insurance grew by 12 per cent and mortgage lending in the bank by 15 per cent. At the same time, work has been done on integration and development of the savings platform Kron, the /fintech company Storebrand acquired in 2022 and took over in January 2023. Kron has shown strong growth in 2023, increasing its number of customers and assets under management by 50 and 60 per cent respectively.\n\n## People /first\n\nStorebrand's employees are the most important source of innovation, development and further growth for the company. To succeed with the goals and create a future to look forward to, we need employees who are competent and brave pioneers.\n\nStorebrand scores signi/ficantly better than the /financial industry average on employee engagement. This creates value for employees, customers and shareholders alike.\n\n## Leadership in sustainability\n\nFor almost 30 years, Storebrand has pioneered sustainable investments. We strive to create value for our customers and positive ripple e/ffects for society. We",

We incorporate climate risk assessments into our ongoing risk monitoring, follow-up and reporting to supervisory authorities. Storebrand has ambitions to lead and develop the sustainability agenda within the /financial industry also in the years to come.\n\nMore information about our sustainability work is discussed later in our sustainability report.\n\n## Digital frontrunner\n\nThe use of technology makes it possible to combine growth initiatives and measures for increased competitiveness, while at the same time realising cost reductions and e/fficiency gains. Smart use of data paves the way for new business opportunities and e/fficiency gains, both through digitalisation and automation. Storebrand is adopting modern cloud solutions, enabling faster time-to-market and better access to new digital capabilities. The degree of automation is constantly increasing, which leads to more e/fficient processes, lower costs, increased sales and customer satisfaction.\n\nMore information about our digital initiatives is described in the chapter 'Consumers and end-users' under the section 'Digital innovator in /financial services'.\n\nManagement of capital and balance sheet Over the past ten years, Storebrand has succeeded in transforming its business from capital-intensive products\n\nwith guaranteed returns, to fast-growing and self-/financing capital e/fficient products. Total assets have more than doubled since 2012. At the end of the year, 76 per cent of the total assets under management were related to the capital e/fficient growth business, and less than 43 per cent of the pension assets on the balance sheet were guaranteed reserves. Premiums paid and the Group's pro/fit were mainly related to non-guaranteed savings and insurance.\n\nStorebrand's fast-growing capital e/fficient business generates a high return on equity, while the capitalintensive business with interest rate guarantees that is in run-o/ff, generates a lower return on equity. The guaranteed business ties up about 78 per cent of the Group's equity and achieved an adjusted return on equity of 8 per cent in 2023. The growth business achieved an adjusted return on equity of 31 per cent. 6) The Group's overall return on equity (adjusted) was 13 per cent in 2023.\n\nThe solvency ratio was 192 per cent at the end of 2023, an increase of 8 percentage points compared to the solvency margin at the end of last year. This is after the provision of dividends and completed share buybacks equivalent to 12 percentage points of solvency in 2023.\n\nStorebrand wants to contribute to a growing market for green bonds and stimulate the market for sustainable investments and /financing. See more information about this in the Sustainability Report on page 49.\n\nDevelopment in Storebrand's operations and balance sheet since 2012\n\n## Premium payments, NOK billion\n\n## Assets under management, NOK billion\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n6) Based on the IFRS equity at opening balance excl. hybrid capital and expected dividends. The split between the growth and guaranteed lines of business is based on the consumption of unrestricted capital in Solvency II and CRD 4. Unit Linked and Insurance are adjusted to a solvency margin of 150 per cent, while Guaranteed Pension (including Other) ties up about 240 per cent of its capital requirement. The RoE is calculated on trailing twelve months result after tax and before amortisation basis, divided by the allocated equity.",

Shareholder matters\n- 4. Annual Accounts and Notes\n- 5. Ap/fiendix\n\n## Group results 2023\n\nThe Group results for 2023 are reported in accordance with IFRS 17 and IFRS 9, which replace IFRS 4 and IAS 39 starting from January 1, 2023. The purpose of IFRS 17 is to establish consistent practices for the accounting treatment of insurance contracts and enhance transparency, both within insurance companies and across sectors. The implementation of IFRS 17 signi/ficantly impacts the accounting for insurance contracts within the Storebrand Group, including the timing of recognition and presentation in /financial statements.\n\nA brief overview of the /financial results under IFRS is discussed in the section titled 'Group Financial Statements Storebrand (IFRS)' For other parts of the annual report, the results are commented based on the alternative reporting. This alternative reporting may deviate substantially from the IFRS /financial statements, particularly for the insurance segment of the business reporting under IFRS 17. While the alternative reporting represents an approximation of the cash /flow generated during the period, the IFRS statement includes the impact of updated estimates and assumptions about future cash /flows. Detailed information about the alternative reporting and related key /figures can be found on Storebrand's Investor Relations pages.\n\nThe alternative reporting is based on statutory accounting prepared in accordance with Norwegian GAAP (NGAAP) for Norwegian entities and Swedish GAAP (SGAAP) for Swedish entities. The reporting framework is similar to previous reporting under IFRS 4. The alternative result is adjusted for intercompany transactions and result items related to customer funds. The adoption of IFRS 17 does not signi/ficantly impact the statutory /financial statements under Norwegian and Swedish GAAP, nor does it materially a/ffect the alternative reporting. Therefore, the results in the alternative reporting continue to be a good approximation of the free cash /flow generated by the business units.\n\n## Group results 7)\n\n| NOK million                                        | 2023   | 2022   |\n|----------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Fee and administration income                      | 6,782  | 6,062  |\n| Insurance result                                   | 1,122  | 1,664  |\n| Operational cost                                   | -5,787 | -5,008 |\n| Cash equivalent earnings from  operations          | 2,117  | 2,718  |\n| Financial items and risk result life               | 1,362  | 13     |\n| Cash equivalent earnings before  amortisation      | 3,480  | 2,732  |\n| Amortisation and write-downs of  intangible assets | -379   | -202   |\n| Cash equivalent earnings before tax                | 3,101  | 2,530  |\n| Tax                                                | 116    | 225    |\n| Cash equivalent earnings after tax                 | 3,217  | 2,754  |\n\nStorebrand achieved cash equivalent earnings before amortisation and tax of NOK 3,480 million in 2023 (NOK 2,732 million). The /figures in parentheses represent the corresponding numbers for the previous year.\n\nFee and administration income for the year amounted to NOK 6,782 million (NOK 6,062 million). The increase from the previous year is attributed to higher assets under management driven by underlying growth and positive market development. Additionally, increased performance related income from active funds contributed positively by NOK 242 million (NOK 147 million) in 2023.\n\nThe insurance result was NOK 1,122 million (NOK 1,664 million), resulting in a combined ratio of 102 per cent (91 per cent). This performance falls short of the Group's targeted combined ratio of 90-92 per cent and is due to weak results in P&C and disability-related insurance products.\n\n7) This is based on the Storebrand Group's alternative income statement and contains alternative performance measures (APM) as de/fined by the European Securities and Market Authority (ESMA). The alternative income statement is based on reported IFRS results for the individual Group companies. The pro/fit and loss setup di/ffers from the o/fficial accounting setup. An overview of the APMs used in /financial reporting is available on www.storebrand.com/ir.",

Adjusted for integration costs, currency e/ffects, and performance related costs in asset management, operational costs totalled NOK -5,320 million, well in line with the cost guidance of NOK 5.3 billion for 2023.\n\nThe cash equivalent earnings from operations were NOK 2,117 million (NOK 2,718 million).\n\nFinancial items and risk result life amounted to NOK 1,362 million (NOK 13 million). The strong /financial result is attributed to increased interest rates, which improve returns on company portfolios. Additionally, there was signi/ficant uplift in pro/fit sharing in the Swedish guaranteed business. The Group also achieved a robust risk result in its life business.\n\nAmortisation and write-downs of intangible assets amounted to NOK -379 million (NOK -202 million). The increase is primarily due to impairment of intangible assets related to distribution agreements canceled in connection with Danske Bank's sale of its Norwegian retail banking business. 8)\n\nCash equivalent earnings before tax was NOK 3,101 million (NOK 2,530 million)\n\nThe Group concluded the year with a net tax income of NOK 116 million (NOK 225 million kroner). The tax income is mainly driven by a tax gain of approx. NOK 440 million as the Tax Appeals Committee gave Storebrand full consent in a disputed tax case for the income year 2015. In the 4th quarter, the Ministry of Finance issued a subpoena against the Tax Appeals Committee in the same case. There is no new information in the subpoena which, in Storebrand's opinion, provides grounds for changes in the company's accounts. The estimated normal tax rate for the Group ranges from 19 to 22 per cent, depending on the contribution of each legal entity to the consolidated result. For more information on taxes and uncertain tax positions, please see Note 26. Storebrand also has a responsible taxation policy and publishes a separate tax report on its website.\n\nThe Group's cash equivalent earnings after tax were NOK 3,217 million (NOK 2,754 million).\n\n| Financial targets  9)                        | Target   | Actual 2023   |\n|----------------------------------------------|----------|---------------|\n| Return on equity*                            | > 10 %   | 13 %          |\n| Future Storebrand  (Savings and Insurance)** |          | 31 %          |\n| Run-o/ff business  (Guaranteed and Other)**  |          | 8 %           |\n| Dividend pay-out ratio                       |          | 57 %          |\n| Solvency ratio (Storebrand Group)            | > 150 %  | 192 %         |\n\nThe company's reporting is divided into the segments Savings, Insurance, Guaranteed, and Other.

Shareholder matters\n- 4. Annual Accounts and Notes\n- 5. Ap/fiendix\n\n## Financial Results\n\nFee and administration income amounted to NOK 5,443 million (NOK 4,733 million). The increase from 2022 is attributed to higher assets under management driven by structural growth in pension, net in/flow in capital management, and positive market development. Higher performance fees from active funds and the acquisition of Danica also contribute positively to the development. Strong lending growth and improved interest margin in the bank led to an increase in fee and administration income of NOK 303 million compared to last year.\n\nOperational cost totalled NOK -3,582 million (NOK -3,031 million). The increase stems from a combination of costs from acquired businesses, in/flation, and investments in growth and digitalisation initiatives. Performance related costs in funds with performance fees amounted to NOK -106 million (NOK -53 million).\n\nThe /financial result amounted to NOK 1 million (NOK -49 million). The asset management business contributed positively with NOK 56 million kroner (NOK -3 million). In the retail bank, /financial items were NOK -55 million (NOK -44 million), driven by some realised loan losses and model-driven provisions.\n\nCash equivalent earnings before amortisation amounted to a total of NOK 1,862 million (NOK 1,653 million).\n\n## Balance and Market Development\n\nThe underlying net in/flow continued in 2023, both within Unit Linked and asset management. Unit Linked reserves grew by NOK 65.5 billion (20 per cent) to NOK 380 billion in 2023. Net in/flow added NOK 15 billion, and market returns and currency increased reserves by NOK 49 billion.\n\nAssets under management for Storebrand Asset Management increased by NOK 192 billion (19 per cent) to NOK 1,212 billion. Net in/flow amounted to NOK 70 billion, in addition to NOK 98 billion in returns and NOK 23 billion in positive currency e/ffects.\n\nThe bank's lending volume grew by NOK 10 billion (14 per cent) to NOK 77 billion.\n\n## Key /figures Savings\n\n| NOK million          | 2023      | 2022      |\n|----------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Unit Linked Reserves | 379,516   | 314,003   |\n| Unit Linked Premiums | 28,187    | 23,482    |\n| AuM Asset Management | 1,211,831 | 1,019,988 |\n| Retail Lending       | 76,706    | 67,061    |\n\n## Insurance\n\n| NOK million                                   | 2023   | 2022   |\n|-----------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Insurance pemiums f.o.a.                      | 6,908  | 6,088  |\n| Claims f.o.a.                                 | -5,787 | -4,424 |\n| Operational cost                              | -1,251 | -1,112 |\n| Cash equivalent earnings from  operations     | - 129  | 552    |\n| Financial result                              | 155    | 43     |\n| Cash equivalent earnings before  amortisation | 27     | 596    |\n\n## Financial results\n\nInsurance premiums for own account (f.o.a) grew 13 per cent to NOK 6,908 million in 2023 (NOK 6,088 million), driven by continued volume growth in the retail market and price increases. Insurance claims increased to NOK -5,787 million (NOK -4,424 million) because of growth and adverse development in the claims ratio. The claims ratio ended at 84 per cent for the year, a 11 percentage points increase compared to the year before. The increased claims ratio is primarily due to high claims in P&C and disability-related insurance products. Within property insurance, extreme weather events such as 'Hans,' other weather-related damages, and persistent high in/flation contributed to weak results. The poor results related to disability stem from high disability claims and a reserve strengthening due to increased disability rates in society.\n\nOperational costs for the year amounted to NOK -1,251 million (NOK -1 112 million) and resulted in an unchanged cost ratio of 18 per cent in 2023.\n\nThe combined ratio was 102 per cent (91 per cent) and cash equivalent earnings from operations was NOK -129 million (NOK 552 million) for the year. This is weaker than the Group's targeted 'combined ratio' of 90-92 per cent across all segments. Several measures have been implemented, including repricing, to strengthen pro/fitability from 2024 onwards.\n\nThe /financial result was NOK 155 million (NOK 43 million). The insurance investment portfolio amounted to NOK 12.3 billion at the end of 2023 (NOK 10.6 billion) and achieved a return of 3.5 per cent 10) .\n\nCash equivalent earnings before amortisation was NOK 27 million (NOK 596 million).\n\n## Balance sheet and market development\n\nTotal growth in written portfolio premiums amounted to 11 per cent in 2023, ending at NOK 8,697 million. P&C and Individual Life grew 10 per cent to NOK 4,430 million, Group life and Health grew 13 per cent to NOK 2,339 million, and Pension related disability insurance grew 11 per cent to NOK 1,928 million.",

The operational costs were NOK -822 million (NOK -850 million). The income development re/flects a stable trend in overall volume and margins. The majority of the business is in long-term runo/ff, but there is growth within public occupational pensions and transfers of corporate pension funds. The cost reduction is primarily due to a reallocation of costs from Guaranteed to Savings within the Swedish operations.\n\nThe risk result for life and pensions was NOK 296 million (NOK 262 million). A continued strong risk result is driven by positive disability development and a stronger result due to increased mortality following the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe pro/fit sharing result was NOK 252 million (NOK -106 million). Pro/fit sharing is primarily generated within the Swedish business, while the focus in the Norwegian portfolio was on building bu/ffer capital. Net pro/fit sharing\n\nin Norway totaled NOK 11 million. In Sweden, net pro/fit sharing amounted to NOK 241 million, driven by strong returns. The booked return averaged 1.4 per cent in Norway, compared to an average customer guarantee of 2.9 per cent at the end of the year. Contracts with insu/fficient returns have been compensated through the use of bu/ffer capital and therefore had no material impact on results. In Sweden, assets and liabilities have similar durations. The average fair value return in Sweden was 9.8 per cent. The injection of deferred capital contribution to individual contracts has, in isolation, resulted in a negative contribution to results.\n\nCash equivalent earnings before amortisation was NOK 1,326 million (previously NOK 903 million).\n\n## Balance sheet and market development\n\nAt the end of the year, guaranteed reserves amounted to NOK 284 billion. This is NOK 10 billion more than in 2022. The increase is attributed to positive currency e/ffects for the Swedish guaranteed business, as well as growth within public occupational pensions in Norway and the transfer of closed pension funds. As a share of the total balance, guaranteed reserves correspond to 42.8 per cent (46.6 per cent) at the end of the year, a reduction of 4 percentage points from last year.\n\nBu/ffer capital, which secures customer returns and shields shareholders' equity under turbulent market conditions, fell to 6.1 per cent (6.3 per cent) of reserves in Norway, but increased to 21.2 per cent (19.0 per cent) in Sweden. In total, the bu/ffer capital amounts to NOK 26.4 billion (excl. excess value of bonds at amortised cost) at the end of the year, representing an increase of NOK 2.5 billion compared to the previous year.\n\n## Key /figures Guaranteed Pension\n\n| NOK million                                          | 2023    | 2022    |\n|------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|\n| Guaranteed reserves                                  | 283,986 | 273,673 |\n| Guaranteed reserves in % of total  reserves          | 42.8 %  | 46.6 %  |\n| Net in/flows and out/flows, excluding  transfers     | -10,383 | -10,187 |\n| Average booked return in Norway                      | 1.4 %   | 1.4 %   |\n| Average guarantee in Norway*                         | 2.9 %   | 3.0 %   |\n| Average value-adjusted return in  Sweden             | 9.8 %   | -10.4 % |\n| Average guarantee in Sweden                          | 2.7 %   | 2.8 %   |\n| Bu/ffer capital in % of customer reserves  in Norway | 6.1 %   | 6.3 %   |\n| Bu/ffer capital in % of customer reserves  in Sweden | 21.2 %  | 19.0 %  |",

Integration costs related to\n\nacquired businesses contribute to increased expenses and lower earnings from operating. The /financial result was NOK 658 million, a signi/ficant increase from NOK -138 million last year. The positive development in the /financial result is primarily explained by higher interest rates contributing to improved returns in the company portfolios. The cash equivalent earnings before amortisation was NOK 265 million (NOK  -420 million).\n\n## Dividend for 2023\n\nThe Board has an established capital management framework that links dividends to the solvency ratio. The dividend policy should re/flect the strong growth in earnings from operations, more volatile /financial marketrelated earnings and future capital release from operations with guarantees. The Board's ambition is to pay a steady, but nominally, increasing ordinary dividend. In addition, the expected release of capital will result in increased distribution over time, primarily in the form of share buybacks.\n\nBased on the Group's solvency, liquidity and expected pro/fit generation, and taking into account the prevailing uncertainty in /financial markets and macroeconomics, the Board proposes an ordinary dividend of NOK 1.8 billion, corresponding to an ordinary dividend of NOK 4.10 per share and a dividend pay-out ratio of 57 per cent for 2023 to the Annual General Meeting. This is in addition to the share buybacks of NOK 1,500 million which was completed during 2023.\n\nFor more information about historical dividends, Storebrand's share and other shareholder relationships, see the chapter 'Shareholder matters'.\n\n## Dividend policy\n\nThe Board of Directors ambition is to pay ordinary dividends per share of at least the same nominal amount as the previous year. Ordinary dividends are subject to a sustainable solvency margin of above 150 per cent. If the solvency margin is above 175 per cent, the Board of Directors intends to propose special dividends or share buybacks.\n\n12) This is based on the Storebrand Group's alternative income statement and contains alternative performance measures (APM) as de/fined by the European Securities and Market Authority (ESMA). The alternative income statement is based on reported IFRS results for the individual Group companies. The pro/fit and loss setup di/ffers from the o/fficial accounting setup. An overview of the APMs used in /financial reporting is available on www.storebrand.com/ir.",

Shareholder matters\n- 4. Annual Accounts and Notes\n- 5. Ap/fiendix\n\n## Capital situation\n\nStorebrand adapts the level of equity and debt in the Group continuously and systematically. The level is adjusted to the company's /financial risk and capital requirements. Growth and composition of business areas are important drivers for capital needs. Capital management is designed to ensure an e/fficient capital structure and contribute to achieving business goals within regulatory requirements. The balance sheet shall form a healthy foundation and support the Group's growth strategy while returning released capital to shareholders.\n\nThe Group's target is to maintain a solvency ratio according to the standard model in Solvency II of at least 150 per cent. At the end of 2023, the solvency ratio for the Group was reported at 192 per cent, an increase of 8 percentage points from 184 per cent in 2022. Pro/fit generation in the Group contributed 13 percentage points, before dividends and share buybacks, which together reduced the solvency ratio by 12 percentage points.\n\nThe main subsidiary Storebrand Livsforsikring AS solvency ratio was 250 per cent, representing a 34 per cent increase from the previous year. The Market value adjustment reserve, including the bu/ffer fund for contracts related to public occupational pensions, has grown by NOK 2.7 billion, totalling NOK 4.5 billion at year-end. Additional statutory reserves amounted to NOK 6.9 billion at the end of the year, re/flecting a reduction of NOK 2.7 billion compared to the previous year. The booked returns for parts of the guaranteed portfolio have been slightly lower than the guaranteed returns, leading to a reduction in additional statutory reserves in 2023. The excess value of bonds and loans at amortised cost have increased by NOK 0.4 billion in 2023 and amounted to minus NOK 10.6 billion at the end of the year. The excess value of\n\nbonds and loans at amortised cost is not included in the accounts. The subsidiary SPP Pension & F\u00f6rs\u00e4kring AB reported a solvency ratio of 156 per cent at year end. The conditional bonuses have increased by NOK 2.5 billion during the year and amounted to NOK 15.0 billion at the end of the year.\n\nStorebrand Bank Group had a Core Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio of 17.0 per cent and a capital adequacy ratio of 21.8 per cent at the end of 2023. The Group has satisfactory capital adequacy and liquidity based on its operations. The lending portfolio consists primarily of low-risk home mortgages with an average LTV (loan-to-value) of 63 per cent.\n\nStorebrand ASA (holding) held liquid assets of NOK 2.4 billion at the end of 2023. Liquid assets consist primarily of short-term /fixed income securities with a high credit rating. Storebrand ASA's total interest-bearing liabilities were NOK 0.5 billion at the end of the year, which matures in September 2025. In addition to its liquidity portfolio, the company has an unused credit facility of EUR 200 million, which expires in December 2025. Storebrand ASA recognised dividend and Group contributions from subsidiaries of NOK 4,465 million in 2023. Dividends allocated to shareholders amounted to NOK 1.8 billion.\n\n## Rating\n\nFour companies in the Storebrand Group issue debt securities. These are rated by the credit rating agency S&P Global. Storebrand Livsforsikring AS, the main operating entity, aims to have at least an A-rating. Both Storebrand Livsforsikring AS and Storebrand Bank ASA have a rating of 'A' with stable outlook. Storebrand Boligkreditt AS's covered bond program is rated 'AAA', and Storebrand ASA is rated 'BBB+'",

Ap/fiendix\n\n## Group Financial Statements Storebrand (IFRS)\n\nThe consolidated /financial statements of Storebrand are prepared in accordance with IFRS Accounting Standards as established by the EU. Storebrand achieved a pro/fit before amortisation and tax of NOK 3,759 million (NOK 2,681 million). The /figures in parentheses represent restated amounts for the previous year in accordance with IFRS 9 and IFRS 17.\n\nOperating income excluding insurance amounted to NOK 8,597 million (NOK 6,396 million). The increase from the previous year is attributed to higher assets under management driven by underlying growth and positive market developments, as well as higher performance fees from active funds.\n\nNet insurance service result amounted to NOK 1,465 million (NOK 2,282 million). The decline from the corresponding period last year is due to weak results in P&C and disability-related insurance products.\n\nThe operating pro/fit was NOK 2,653 million (NOK 3,551 million).\n\nNet /finance result was NOK 1,106 million (NOK -870 million). The increased /financial contribution is mainly a result of increased interest rates leading to improved returns on company portfolios.\n\nAmortisation of intangible assets amounted to NOK -466 million (NOK -324 million). The increase is mainly due to impairment of intangible assets related to the cancellation of a distribution agreement in connection with Danske Bank's sale of its Norwegian retail banking business. Furthermore, the increase is attributed to amortisation of intangible assets related to the acquisition of Kron.\n\nPro/fit before income tax was NOK 3,294 million (NOK 2,357 million).\n\nThe Group ended the year with a tax income of NOK 84 million (NOK 19 million). The tax income is driven by a tax gain of approx. NOK 440 million as the Tax Appeals Committee gave Storebrand full consent in a disputed tax case for the income year 2015. In the 4th quarter, the Ministry of Finance issued a subpoena against the Tax Appeals Committee in the same case. There is no new information in the subpoena which, in Storebrand's view, provides grounds for changes in the /financial statements. The estimated normal tax rate for the Group ranges from 19 per cent to 22 per cent, depending on the contribution of each legal entity to the consolidated result. For more information on taxes and uncertain tax positions, please see Note 26.\n\nThe pro/fit for the year after tax was NOK 3,377 million (NOK 2,376 million).",

Shareholder matters\n- 4. Annual Accounts and Notes\n- 5. Ap/fiendix\n\n## Risk\n\nOur risk management framework is designed to take the appropriate risks to deliver returns to customers and owners. At the same time, the framework will ensure that we protect our customers, owners, employees and other stakeholders from unwanted incidents and losses. The framework covers all risks to which Storebrand may be exposed. Despite geopolitical unrest and di/fficult global economic conditions, Storebrand delivered good results and strengthened its solidity in 2023.\n\nThe Board of Directors of Storebrand ASA and the boards of its subsidiaries discuss and adopt risk appetite and risk strategy at least annually. Risk-taking is intended to help us achieve our strategic and commercial goals, ensure that our customers receive a competitive return on their pension assets, and that Storebrand receives su/fficient payment for assuming risk. Overall risk-taking is controlled by setting limits for the level of risk and for the types of risks that are acceptable. Based on this, more detailed strategies are being drawn up for di/fferent risk categories. Storebrand publishes an annual Solvency and Financial Position (SFCR) report that helps customers and other stakeholders understand the risk in the business and how it is managed.\n\nThe Board assesses risk in the process for own risk and solvency assessment (ORSA). Financial market risk is Storebrand's biggest risk. In the short term, turbulent /financial markets, particularly falling equity, credit and property markets, may result in investment losses, or falling interest rates may increase insurance liability. In the longer term, persistently low interest rates represent a risk because it reduces the ability to achieve guaranteed investment returns. Other risk areas considered are business risk, insurance risk, counterparty risk, operational risk, sustainability risk including climate risk, and liquidity risk.\n\nGood equity and credit markets were positive for investment returns in 2023, while declines in real estate values had a negative impact. Customer bu/ffers were reduced, resulting in lower risk capacity for guaranteed pensions. At the end of 2023, the interest rate level was higher than the return guarantee. This increased return expectations and reduced the risk of not achieving the guarantee.\n\nIn order to reduce the short-term risk associated with rising interest rates, Storebrand has over time built a robust portfolio of long-duration and high-credit quality bonds that are recognised at amortised cost. This provides a stable annual return because changes in interest rates have no accounting e/ffect. This strengthens our ability to take other risks and increases expected returns for\n\ncustomers. Under prevailing market conditions, modelbased valuations of /financial instruments (level 3), such as real estate investments, contain greater uncertainty than usual. Storebrand has an active risk management strategy to optimise customer returns and shield shareholders' equity in turbulent market conditions. We perform dynamic risk management, hold strong customer bu/ffers and place a signi/ficant proportion of bonds at amortised cost in the customer accounts.\n\nIn/flation remained high in 2023, including Norway and Sweden. High and rapidly rising in/flation may result in higher costs and insurance claims. However, the e/ffect of in/flation on the Group's liabilities is limited because pension liabilities - our largest liabilities - are not adjusted for in/flation. Pension premiums and insurance premiums linked to wage growth provide a degree of automatic in/flation protection through premium growth. For other products, such as non-life insurance, actively monitoring in/flation developments and accordingly adjust prices is needed to mitigate the negative e/ffects of in/flation.\n\nStorebrand may su/ffer /financial losses as a result of inadequate or failing internal processes or systems, human error, or external events (operational risk). Undesirable incidents are reported and followed up. At the overall level, there is an increase in the number of reported incidents in 2023. The number of nonconformity reports to the Data Protection Authority has increased somewhat compared with 2022.\n\nThe risk exposure varies between business areas. The main risks are described per business area below. Risks associated with regulatory changes are discussed in the chapter 'Outlook'.\n\n## Insurance\n\nInsurance consists of risk products and non-life insurance. Prices are normally adjusted on an annual basis if the balance of risks changes.\n\nThe greatest risk is related to disability insurance coverage. These coverages trigger payouts from Storebrand when individuals become disabled, meaning that Storebrand faces the risk of increased disability frequency or higher compensation levels than expected. The compensation may be in the form of a one-time payment (disability capital) or as an annual disability pension. Disability capital disbursement is /final. The annual disability pension generally continues until the disabled person transitions to a retirement pension at age 67, and a reserve is set aside for future payments once disability is con/firmed. When calculating the reserve, consideration is given to the possibility that the disabled person may become partially",

This entails a risk that reactivation may be lower than expected.\n\nWe also o/ffer coverage that pays out in the event of death, but Storebrand's risk from this is limited. In non-life insurance, most of the risk is related to developments in claims payments from car and home insurance. Climate and weather changes a/ffect future payments.\n\n## Savings\n\nSavings consist of unit-linked and other non-guaranteed pensions, asset management activities and banking.\n\nFor unit-linked, each customer bears the risk that returns may be low or negative. The goal is to achieve the best possible risk-adjusted return. Storebrand facilitates informed investment choices for customers based on their risk tolerance and sustainability preferences, including gradual risk reduction towards retirement age. Payouts are primarily time-limited, and Storebrand faces low risk related to increased life expectancy. Within unit-linked, Storebrand's risk is primarily associated with changes in future income and costs.\n\nThe asset management business o/ffers active and passive portfolio management, as well as management of fundin-fund structures. Operational risks, including regulatory compliance, pose the greatest risks.\n\nThe greatest risks for the banking business are credit risk and liquidity risk. Virtually the entire loan portfolio is secured by mortgages on real estate, which limits the bank's credit risk.\n\n## Guaranteed pension\n\nGuaranteed pension encompasses savings and pension products with guaranteed returns. The primary risks associated with these products are /financial market risk and longevity risk.\n\nA common feature across these products is that Storebrand guarantees a minimum return. In Norway, the return must exceed the guaranteed level each year, while in Sweden, achieving the guaranteed average return over time is more su/fficient.\n\nLower interest rates increase the value of the guaranteed obligations and make it more challenging to achieve the guaranteed rate. We strive to manage risk through investments, but there remains residual risk related to declining interest rates.\n\nThe traditional guaranteed products for the private sector are not available to new customers, but signi/ficant reserves remain on the balance sheet. New premiums primarily stem from deposit pension plans (unit-linked) or hybrid arrangements with a zero per cent guarantee.\n\nStorebrand aims to expand in the market for publicly guaranteed occupational pensions and acquired new customers in 2023. Public pensions di/ffer from guaranteed\n\npensions in the private sector because employers pay premiums for the interest rate guarantee, even for departing employees and retirees.\n\n## Other\n\nThe Other category include the holding company Storebrand ASA, as well as the company portfolios. The assets in Storebrand ASA and the company portfolios are invested with low risk, primarily in short-term interestbearing securities with high creditworthiness.\n\n## Tax\n\nOver the past several years, there have been changes in Norwegian tax legislation for insurance companies. Some of these legal amendments, along with associated transitional rules, are interpreted di/fferently by Storebrand and the Norwegian Tax Administration (Skatteetaten). Consequently, Storebrand has unresolved tax positions related to the income years 2015 and 2018. In 2023, Storebrand received a favourable decision from the Tax Appeals Committee (Skatteklagenemnda) in one of the cases, resulting in the recognition of a positive tax result of NOK 439 million for 2023. However, the Ministry of Finance has /filed a lawsuit against the Tax Appeals Committee's decision. If Storebrand's interpretation is accepted in all remaining cases, a positive tax result of up to NOK 1.6 billion could be recorded. Conversely, if all preliminary interpretations by the Tax Administration become /final, Storebrand may need to account for a tax expense of approximately NOK 1.7 billion. Finalising these processes may take several years. If necessary, Storebrand will seek legal clari/fication. Further details on uncertain tax positions are provided in Note 26 on page 251 of the /financial statements.\n\n## Sustainability risks and opportunities\n\nSustainability risk is assessed using double materiality, a method for assessing how the environment and nature, social conditions and corporate governance a/ffect and are a/ffected by a business. This means that Storebrand must consider both its own impact on the environment and people, and how environmental and social conditions may a/ffect Storebrand's /financial situation and value creation. Sustainability-related topics present both risks and opportunities. Storebrand has a strategy for working with sustainability that will help reduce risk and realise opportunities, both for society and for Storebrand.\n\n## De/finitions\n\nSustainability risks are environmental, social or corporate governance events that have a negative impact on customers or society or result in /financial loss or loss of reputation for Storebrand. The risk can be divided into risks related to the environment, social issues and inadequate corporate governance. Environmental risk can be divided into climate risk and nature risk.\n\nClimate risk is the consequences of physical climate change or e/ffects of the transition to low emissions that have a negative impact on customers or society or result in /financial loss or loss of reputation for Storebrand.",

Shareholder matters\n- 4. Annual Accounts and Notes\n- 5. Ap/fiendix\n\nNature risks are consequences for both the surrounding environment and Storebrand resulting from the loss of nature (e.g. changes in ecosystems, reduced biodiversity, deforestation or soil degradation) or the transition to a society where the use of nature is within the earth's tolerance limits (for example, changes in policies, regulations or technology).\n\nSocial sustainability risks are consequences for the society or Storebrand of inadequate adaptation to the needs of customers, employees, suppliers or society. The risk can be related to human rights, working conditions, gender equality, health, education, culture, local communities, demographics and other factors that a/ffect people's quality of life.\n\nSustainability risk related to corporate governance is de/ficiencies in corporate governance principles that may have negative consequences for customers, employees or other stakeholders or result in /financial loss or loss of reputation for Storebrand.\n\n## Sustainability risks and opportunities for investments\n\nStorebrand Asset Management (SAM) manages capital on behalf of both internal and external clients. The company's responsibility is to manage clients' portfolios to achieve the best long term, risk-adjusted returns. SAM recognises the signi/ficance of managing environmental, social, and governance-related risks and opportunities to ful/fil this duty.\n\nSustainability risk can impact investment values in two ways:\n\n- \u00b7  Relative risk: SAM's investment choices may diverge from portfolio indices or competitors-for instance, by excluding certain industries or companies and allocating more to solution companies.\n- \u00b7  Absolute risk: Sustainability-related factors can a/ffect overall /financial market returns. For example, economic growth may be in/fluenced by physical climate and environmental changes, or unsuccessful policies aimed at achieving zero emissions and other transition risks.\n\nOur e/fforts to manage sustainability risk primarily involve active ownership, allocating capital to companies contributing to the UN Sustainable Development Goals, and excluding companies that fail meet our sustainability standards.\n\nWe directly manage real estate investments in Scandinavia on behalf of both internal and external clients. Storebrand has signi/ficant in/fluence over environmental and climate risk within the real estate portfolio through investment and operational decisions for each property, as well as the company's impact on the society.\n\nStorebrand's life insurance companies set their own requirements for sustainability in managing investments in real estate and securities, with a primary focus on climate considerations. The majority of these investments are linked to pensions. The value of mitigating long-term\n\nclimate risk is evident. The time horizon from pension contributions being made to their eventual payout as retirement bene/fits can span more than 50 years. Therefore, Storebrand Livsforsikring and SPP aim for investment management, including impact work, to contribute to reducing physical climate and natural risks.\n\nMost of the investment portfolio is managed by SAM and adheres to criteria for sustainable investments in securities and real estate. Additionally, the life insurance companies de/fine their own sustainability goals as part of their investment strategy. For instance, Storebrand Livsforsikring's de/fined contribution pension aims to reduce carbon emissions from investments by 32 per cent from 2018 to 2025 (across stocks, real estate, and bonds). SPP has decided that all their investments should be fossil-free.\n\nThe pension bene/fits for customers depend on achieved returns. The investment choices made by Storebrand Livsforsikring and SPP in/fluence how climate and natural risks can impact returns. These choices have the most signi/ficant e/ffect on transition risk, particularly because fossil fuel companies are underweighted while solution companies are overweighted. The impact of these decisions is assessed across various climate scenarios in the chapter 'Climate risks and opportunities'.\n\n## Environmental risk (climate and nature)\n\nThe magnitude of physical climate risk depends on how much and how rapidly the climate is changing. A common reference for overall physical climate risk is the increase in global average temperature since pre-industrial times. The UN estimates that global temperature rise has already reached 1.1 degrees.\n\nThe size of transition risk is determined by how swiftly and forcefully the transition to low emissions occurs. This depends on the alignment and strength of government climate policies, technological developments, and how businesses and consumers adapt.\n\nClimate risk and nature risk are interconnected and can reinforce each other. However, con/flicting objectives may arise where climate considerations and environmental concerns pull in di/fferent directions. For instance, the development of renewable energy may require signi/ficant alterations to natural landscapes.\n\nStorebrand assesses climate risk across three climate scenarios. The risks and opportunities for the Group, as well as the outcomes from these climate scenarios, are further described in the chapter 'Climate risks and opportunities'.\n\n## Social sustainability risk\n\nStorebrand, through our business operations, can in/fluence social conditions for the wider society. Partly through investments, both in terms of investment adjustments and active ownership. Storebrand may also impact society by initiating or supporting initiatives, such as promoting workplace equality or reducing risk of disability in society.",

Shareholder matters\n- 4. Annual Accounts and Notes\n- 5. Ap/fiendix\n\nOur products represent Storebrand's most signi/ficant impact on social conditions. Storebrand's /financial products contribute positively to society and bene/fit our customers. However, these products, along with associated communication, sales, and advisory services, may also pose potential social sustainability risks. This closely relates to an assessment of customer risk, where the goal is to view product or service features from the customer's perspective. For instance, insurance products create customer risk if they do not adequately cover actual insurance needs or if the customer is already insured through other products. Even if the products themselves meet a customer's needs, there may be customer risk if de/ficiencies in advice lead to sales targeting the wrong audience. Marketing and communication could introduce customer risk-for instance, if claims about sustainability bene/fits in a product do not align with reality (greenwashing).\n\nStorebrand also faces risks. Adverse impacts from social conditions in society, such as a workforce contributing to high disability rates, can a/ffect Storebrand's business. Additionally, there is risk if our company does not e/ffectively address customer needs. These risks could result in lower sales, customer attrition, increased operational or capital costs, or higher insurance payouts.\n\n## Sustainability risk related to corporate governance\n\nGood corporate governance and ownership control are essential, both for the organisation to achieve its goals and to avoid negative consequences for the wider community due to inadequate corporate governance. Storebrand's corporate governance is based on our fundamental principles for sustainability work and guidelines for sustainability, as described in the chapter 'Storebrand's sustainability agenda'.\n\nCon/flicts of interest may lead to sustainability risks for customers. Storebrand shall ensure that the customers' interests always take precedence over Storebrand's interests, and that all customers are treated equally. Privacy is also a source of sustainability risk for customers, where Storebrand has developed principles and routines to minimise the risk of such occurrences. Storebrand may also be exposed to threats where actors gain access to personal information. The risk is particularly signi/ficant concerning sensitive data, such as health information. Storebrand is continuously working with information security to enhance our resilience.\n\nMoney laundering and terrorism /financing have signi/ficant negative societal consequences, and. Storebrand has a societal responsibility to prevent this. Storebrand is also subject to extensive obligations through legislation and regulation within this /field.\n\nMoney laundering involves converting proceeds from criminal activities into seemingly legal income or wealth accumulation. Money laundering operations can be divided into three phases: placement, layering, and integration. Storebrand is exposed to all these phases. The inherent risk is highest during the placement phase, where Storebrand Bank is particularly exposed. Asset\n\nmanagement companies are most exposed during the layering phase, involving multiple layers of transactions. Insurance companies face exposure when integrating funds into the legitimate economy. Storebrand has measures in place to monitor customers and detect and prevent money laundering attempts, tailored to the inherent risk in its business. This reduces the actual risk of money laundering, and overall, the risk is assessed as moderate. Our approach to combating money laundering is described in the chapter 'Anti-money laundering and terrorist /financing'.\n\nCorruption also has signi/ficant negative societal impact. Storebrand maintains a zero-tolerance policy and actively works against corruption, both in the company's business activities and with our suppliers and partners. No one should personally or on behalf of others receive bene/fits from Storebrand's business connections if their employment relationship is the reason for receiving such bene/fits. Similarly, none of our employees should provide bene/fits to Storebrand's business connections based on their position, role, or relationship with Storebrand.\n\nTo prevent misuse of market information, employees and representatives associated with Storebrand's securities trading must adhere to high ethical standards. Additionally, employees involved in securities trading are subject to rules regarding their own securities transactions, limiting the scope and requiring pre-approval of trades and reporting.\n\nStorebrand complies with tax legislation in countries we operate in and shall pay the correct taxes. Storebrand does not engage in aggressive tax planning. If Storebrand encounters unclear laws, we are committed to being transparent towards tax authorities.\n\nStorebrand should provide employees with a safe and inclusive work environment that promotes diversity and equality. We encourage employees to report any misconduct. Employees have a duty to report criminal activities and situations where life and health are at risk.\n\nStorebrand also expects our subcontractors to conduct their business responsibly. There is a risk that our suppliers may violate fundamental human rights or fail to provide decent working conditions. Storebrand has robust processes for setting requirements, assessing, and monitoring suppliers. The risk assessment is documented in Storebrand Group's report under the Act on Business Transparency and Work on Fundamental Human Rights and Decent Working Conditions (the Transparency Act). This report, including risk assessments, can be found in the chapter 'The Storebrand Group's report pursuant to the Norwegian Transparency Act' and is also available on Storebrand's website.\n\nThe supply chain may also pose an environmental risk. As a responsible purchaser of goods and services and as a property manager, Storebrand uses our purchasing power to in/fluence suppliers and partners to make the right choices to reduce environmental and climate impact. Our approach to suppliers is described in the chapter 'A responsible value chain'.",

Shareholder matters\n- 4. Annual Accounts and Notes\n- 5. Ap/fiendix\n\n## Outlook\n\n## Market performance\n\nFinancial market performance has a major impact on the Group's solvency ratio and /financial performance. Higher interest rates make it easier to achieve returns above the guaranteed level and generate solvency over time. De/fined contribution pensions and asset management are exposed to stock and credit markets, as well as other asset classes. Market movements will therefore a/ffect revenue driven by assets under management. Foreign currency movements between the Norwegian and Swedish krone a/ffect the reported balance sheet and performance in SPP at a consolidated level. 2023 was a turbulent year for the /financial markets and higher interest rates are increasing the risk of a recession in future years. With a robust risk management framework, and diversi/fied business activities, Storebrand has demonstrated that it is resilient under various market conditions. The Board believes that the Group is well equipped to deliver on the outlined strategy in both strong and challenging /financial markets.\n\n## Financial performance\n\nStorebrand hosted a Capital Market Day in December 2023, which focused on the Group's strategic direction and /financial ambitions towards 2025. Storebrand's ambition is to continue the strong growth in 'Future Storebrand', while a higher interest rate level will contribute to increased pro/fits from guaranteed products and company portfolios. The Group therefore announced that it would raise the return on equity target from 10 per cent to 14 per cent. The pro/fit ambition before amortisation and tax (alternative reporting) has been raised to NOK 5 billion for 2025 and there is an ambition to increase dividends and share buybacs to NOK 12 billion up to and including 2030.\n\nThe business areas' plans to ensure future growth were also presented at the Capital Market Day. In Norway, the de/fined-contribution pension market is growing structurally as a result of the young population for the product. We anticipate single-digit growth in premium payments and double-digit growth in assets under management over the next few years. Storebrand aims to defend its strong position in the market, while also seeking to be a cost leader and improve customer experiences through end-to-end digitalisation.\n\nIn Sweden, SPP is a leading challenger within the segment for non-unionised pensions. We have a digital edge and strong ESG solutions. SPP has become a strong pro/fit\n\ncontributor within the Group, which is supported by ongoing capital release from guaranteed products in long term run o/ff. We expect growth to continue, driven by new sales and fund transfers. SPP is well positioned to further expand its business into adjacent products and services.\n\nAs a leading occupational pension provider in the private sector, Storebrand also has a competitive pension o/ffering to the Norwegian public sector.  This market is larger than the private sector and is experiencing growth. The market is currently dominated by one single major player. Since 2020, Storebrand has succeeded in developing strong foundations for further growth in the market by winning all pension tenders put out in the market. The ambition is to gain NOK 7 billion in annual in/flow over the coming years, with further potential if more municipalities decide to tender their pension procurements.\n\nOverall reserves of guaranteed pensions are expected to decrease in the coming years. Guaranteed reserves constitute a declining share of the Group's total pension reserves and accounted for 42.8 per cent of the pension reserves at the end of the year, around 4 percentage points lower than a year ago. With an interest rate higher than the average guaranteed rate of customer returns, the prospects of pro/fit-sharing with customers have increased in both the Norwegian and Swedish parts of the business.\n\nIn addition to managing internal pension funds, Storebrand Asset Management is also experiencing growth through external mandates from institutional and private investors. The overall ambition is a double-digit increase in assets under management towards 2025, while maintaining the income margin.\n\nThe brand name 'Storebrand' is well recognised in Norway. It facilitates our rapid growth in the Norwegian retail market. The ambition is to achieve growth exceeding 10 per cent annually within personal savings, mortgages and insurance through a focus on customer experience, cross-sales and scale-strengthening e/fforts. P&C insurance is a key area for pro/fitable growth within the Group, and Storebrand Bank has an important strategic role to play when it comes to o/ffering a comprehensive range of /financial products and services. In 2023, Storebrand also strengthened its savings o/ffering by acquiring the rapidly growing Norwegian /fintech company, Kron. The acquisition combines Kron's user experience with Storebrand's product platform and distribution.",

Shareholder matters\n- 4. Annual Accounts and Notes\n- 5. Ap/fiendix\n\nStorebrand has a disciplined cost culture and, in the 20122020 period, the Group experienced /flat nominal costs adjusted for acquisitions, foreign currencies and costs associated with success bonuses. In order to accelerate growth and achieve the Group's pro/fit ambitions, costs associated with investments in pro/fitable growth initiatives have gradually increased in recent years. This includes growth in public service pensions and P&C insurance, as well as acquired companies. E/fficiency measures have been initiated to limit the impact of in/flation on costs in 2024. During the Capital Market Day in December 2023, Storebrand communicated a cost expectation (alternative reporting) of around NOK 5.9 billion for 2024. Should the targeted growth not materialise in the next few years, the management has also identi/fied cost-saving measures that can be implemented to reduce costs.\n\n## Capital management and capital release\n\nStorebrand aims to achieve a solvency ratio of at least 150 per cent. The solvency margin was 192 per cent at the end of 2023. The Group anticipates creating around 16 percentage points in solvency capital from earnings on an annual basis and around 2 percentage points from the guaranteed business in run-o/ff releasing more capital than required for the Group's growth. Altogether around 18 percentage points is expected to be available for dividends, share buybacks and other value creating purposes. The volatility in the /financial market, especially developments in long-term interest rates and regulatory changes, may lead to short-term /fluctuations in the solvency ratio.\n\nThe Board's ambition is to pay increasing ordinary dividends and continue to share buybacks in line with Storebrand's dividend policy, as described in the chapter 'Group results 2023'. The purpose of the buybacks is to return surplus capital that originates from the guaranteed business in run o/ff. The ambition is to return more than NOK 12 billion in capital through share buybacks by the end of 2030. At the same time, the Group anticipates that there will be further surplus capital left to either grow the company further, increase dividends and buybacks, or optimise the capital structure of the Group.\n\nThe combination of increasing earnings and the release of capital is expected to result in growing return on equity over time. The Group's target is a return on equity of 14 per cent going forward.\n\n## Regulatory changes\n\nThe regulations that are adopted by the authorities are of great importance to Storebrand. The most important changes are explained below.\n\n## International regulations\n\n## Solvency II revision\n\nThe trilogue negotiations between the Commission, Council of Ministers and the Parliament concluded in December 2023, with agreement on changes to the Solvency II standard model.  The agreement is based on changes proposed by the European Commission in September 2021.  announced its proposal for\n\namendments to the standard model in Solvency II. The Commission proposed signi/ficant amendments to the EIOPA recommendations from December 2020, including for interest rate risk.\n\nThe main purpose of the revision is to correct shortcomings in the regulations and to make the insurance sector more robust. At the same time, the Commission has noted that it is seeking to enable insurance companies to continue to invest in accordance with the EU's political priorities, particularly with regard to /financing recovery after Covid-19, by facilitating long-term investments and increased capacity to invest in European business. The Commission also underlines the important role of the insurance sector when it comes to /financing the green transition and helping society adapt to climate change. Storebrand currently uses the standard model. Regulatory amendments to the interest rate risk module could increase the solvency capital requirement for Norwegian and Swedish insurance companies. The proposal from the Commission appears to be more representative of Norwegian interest rates than the previous proposal from EIOPA. The Commission has also proposed amendments that could contribute to lower capital requirements through e.g. reduced risk margins. Several amendments have also been proposed with regard to the calculation of e.g. volatility adjustments and an increase in the sample space for the symmetrical adjustment mechanism for equity risk. Overall, the changes agreed upon is not expected to have any signi/ficant impact on Storebrand's solvency ratio.\n\nThe President of the European Parliament has submitted their report, which supports and, in some areas, improves the proposal from the Commission.  The trilogue negotiations between the Commission, Council of Ministers and the Parliament concluded in December 2023. Work will now start on delegated regulations and guidelines. The amendments that are adopted will be incorporated into national legislation and the /final e/ffective date is expected to be in 2026. The Commission will consider a /five-year phasing-in period for new rules linked to the calculation of interest rate risk. The new extrapolation method for interest rates will be gradually phased in towards the end of 2031.\n\n## New standard method for banks\n\nThe European Parliament is expected to approve the agreed proposal for amendments to the capital requirements for banks (Basel III) in relatively near future. The amendments apply to the CRR3 Regulation and the CRD6 Directive and include, among other things, a new standard method for calculating capital requirements for credit risk. The new model will set more equal requirements for standard banks and IRB banks in Norway and is important to Storebrand Bank, which follows the standard method.\n\nThe Ministry of Finance has asked the Financial Supervisory Authority of Norway to draw up a consultation paper on the introduction of the new rules in Norway so that they can be implemented in Norway at the same time they are implemented in the EU, from 1 January 2025.",

Shareholder matters\n- 4. Annual Accounts and Notes\n- 5. Ap/fiendix\n\nIn anticipation of the new standard method, the Ministry of Finance decided to postpone the planned increase in the system risk bu/ffer for standard banks by a year in December 2022, to 31 December 2023. Even though it will be another year until the new standard method is introduced, the Ministry has not postponed the increase in the system risk bu/ffer any further and the system risk bu/ffer requirement for standard bank has increased from 3 to 4.5 per cent. The announced amendments to the Pillar 2 requirements will have only a minor impact on Storebrand Bank.\n\n## EU Sustainable Finance Action Plan\n\nThe EU's goal for Europe to become climate-neutral by 2050 requires major investments. The EU Sustainable Finance Action Plan will increase the share of sustainable investments, promote long-term perspectives and make it clear which /financial products take sustainability into account. The sections below are part of the EU Sustainable Finance Action Plan.\n\n## EU Taxonomy for Sustainable Activities\n\nThe Taxonomy is a classi/fication system that de/fines the economic activities that will contribute to achieving the EU's environmental targets. The Taxonomy and associated reporting requirements were implemented in Norwegian law from 1 January 2023.\n\nCompanies need to consider how their products and services impact the environment in accordance with the Taxonomy. Large listed companies must publish what proportion of their turnover, capital expenditure and operating expenditure is linked to sustainable activities, in line with the technical criteria established by the EU for each sector. Financial institutions must report on what proportion of their products or services complies with the criteria set out in the Taxonomy. In 2023, the reporting requirement applied only to activities that help reduce greenhouse gas emissions or adapt to climate change. In June 2023, the European Commission published new assessment criteria and activities for the last four environmental targets: protecting biodiversity, protecting water and marine resources, preventing pollution and promoting the circular economy.\n\nNorwegian companies were not required to include the new Taxonomy activities in 2023.\n\nThe rules establish standards for sustainable asset management and clarify requirements relating to reporting and customer data. The initiative will help increase trust and transparency within the /financial market and will help achieve the EU's climate and environmental targets. At the same time, the implementation of the Taxonomy is also associated with challenges, both for us as a /financial player and for our customers and partners, for example when it comes to ensuring adequate and reliable data.\n\nThe EU Taxonomy chapter shows what proportion of our activities that are linked to /financial activities that contribute towards achieving the EU's environmental targets. We will continue to monitor the development of the Taxonomy and adapt our reporting to new criteria on an ongoing basis.\n\n## Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD)\n\nThe Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) replaces the previous Non-Financial Reporting Directive (NFRD). CSRD is expected to be implemented in Norwegian law in accordance with the same schedule as the EU. CSRD will expand the reporting requirements currently set out in Section 3-3c of the Norwegian Accounting Act. Sustainability information must be included in the management report and will be increasingly equated to /financial information. CSRD includes standards for sustainability reporting (ESRS).\n\nThe purpose of the directive is to establish transparency and ensure a long-term perspective. The directive requires all listed companies in the EU to report on risks, opportunities and impacts on the environment and society through the value chain, through 'double materiality' assessments. The purpose is for companies to assess how ESG factors in/fluence their /financial situation and how the company a/ffects the outside world. The regulation will provide investors and the authorities with access to comparable, reliable and easily available information about sustainability factors.\n\nWe have conducted gap analyses on our reporting in 2023 to prepare to meet the requirements set out in the new regulation. We will follow up on this work with speci/fic measures in 2024 to ensure that we meet the requirements set out in the regulation. Storebrand's annual report will be in accordance with the regulation when it enters into force in 2025 for the 2024 reporting year.\n\nSustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR) The EU Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR) came into e/ffect in March 2021. SFDR is intended to help customers make well-informed choices about investments and provide them with better insight into how sustainability is integrated into fund investments. The regulation requires Storebrand to be transparent about how it manages sustainability risk, potential negative consequences of investments and the extent to which our investment products take sustainability into account.\n\nIn 2023, the European Commission conducted a review and evaluation of the EU Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR), but it has not yet been decided whether the work will result in an adjustment of the current regulation or a more extensive amendment to the whole framework, which would entail a more general classi/fication of /financial products. A report based on the results of various consultations and workshops in the area is expected to be established in 2024.\n\n## Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID II) and Insurance Distribution Directive (IDD)\n\nIn April 2021, the European Commission adopted a rule change to the existing MiFID II and IDD regulation stating that sustainability must be mapped in the same way as /financial risks. Companies that provide investment advice must obtain information about customers' sustainability preferences, as well as mapping their experience and knowledge of investments. The mapping of sustainability will therefore be an integral part of the suitability assessment companies carry out when o/ffering /financial products.",

It can help raise awareness of ESG factors and make it easier to understand di/fferent types of funds or pro/files with lower carbon footprints. Storebrand is committed to creating good solutions that take into account sustainability and used the Quantfolio advisory tool in 2023 to map customers' sustainability preferences. Regulations relating to sustainability preferences and suitability assessments were introduced in Norwegian law in 2023.\n\n## Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD)\n\nThe Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD) mandates that enterprises perform due diligence to address actual and potential negative impact on human rights and the environment. The Council and the European Parliament entered into a preliminary agreement in December 2023. The agreement must be approved and formally adopted by both institutions. A /final directive is expected to be adopted in 2024.\n\nCSDDD aims to promote sustainability, responsible business conduct, and the integration of human rights and environmental considerations into enterprises' operations and corporate governance. It will require that EU-based or operating enterprises conduct due diligence and respond to stakeholder inquiries regarding their e/fforts to prevent or mitigate negative impacts on human rights and the environment throughout their business activities and value chains. Due diligence must be published and requirements will be imposed for enterprises to draw up a plan for climate targets and integration of human rights and environmental considerations into their corporate governance.\n\n## 'Green Claims' Directive\n\nIn order to combat greenwashing, the European Commission has submitted a legislative proposal intended to ensure that consumers have access to reliable, understandable, comparable and veri/fiable environmental information. This will be achieved through clear rules for enterprises and organisations that use environmental statements in commercial communication or that use eco-labelling. Enterprises must be able to prove the statements used in marketing through veri/fiable data, such as life cycle analyses that take into account all environmental impacts, from production to disposal. The Green Claims Directive proposal is currently being considered by the European Parliament and Council of Ministers and is expected to enter into force in 2024, with a start-up period between 2024 and 2027.\n\n## Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA)\n\nDORA is a new EU regulation intended to strengthen the digital resilience of the /financial sector. DORA will apply to most regulated /financial enterprises, such as banks, insurance companies and securities companies, as well as information and communication (ICT) service providers. DORA includes provisions on governance and risk management, reporting, testing, management of risks relating to third-party suppliers of ICT services and supervision of suppliers of critical ICT services. DORA\n\nwill harmonise the rules across EU member states and elaborate on existing regulations and guidelines within the area of ICT.\n\nDetailed requirements will be published in 2024. DORA will be implemented in full from 17 January 2025. There is a desire to harmonise the rules for the internal market, including EEA countries. Work is therefore under way to ensure that the regulation can enter into force at the same time in the EU and EEA.\n\n## New Insurance Recovery and Resolution Directive (IRRD)\n\nThe EU has agreed to introduce a new directive on the recovery and resolution of insurance companies - the Insurance Recovery and Resolution Directive (IRRD). The purpose is to ensure better protection of policyholders, maintain /financial stability and continue critical functions. The proposal has faced criticism from the insurance industry, which believes that any new rules need to take into account national di/fferences and the unique characteristics of the insurance industry compared to banks. The proposal includes preparing recovery plans for companies that together account for more than 80 per cent of the market. There will also be a need to adapt the national crisis management regulations, which were used when Silver Pensjonsforsikring was placed under public administration in 2017.\n\n## Norwegian Regulations\n\n## Changes to the pension system\n\nThe Norwegian government submitted the Report to the Norwegian Parliament 'Et forbedret pensjonssystem med en styrket sosial pro/fil' ('An improved pension system with a strengthened social pro/file') in December 2023. The report follows up on proposals from the committee that evaluated the pension reform and will be considered by the Norwegian Parliament (the Storting) in 2024. The government wishes to achieve broad political agreement in order to provide stability and predictability for the pension system going forward.\n\nThe Pension Committee concludes that the pension reform has worked as intended, has contributed to limiting the growth in costs for retirement pensions from the National Insurance Scheme and has achieved a /financially sustainable pension system.  The incentives to work have been improved and are resulting in people remaining in work for longer.\n\nThe key proposals to the Norwegian Parliament are:\n\n- -Age limits in the pension system will increase in line with increases in life expectancy from and including those born in 1964.\n- -Minimum bene/fits will be aligned with welfare developments and minimum levels will be adjusted in line with the basic amount (general salary growth).\n- -The retirement pension for individuals with disabilities will be protected for around two thirds of those impacted by the life expectancy adjustment.\n- -Regular broad evaluations of the pension reform and the new pension system will be carried out.",

Shareholder matters\n- 4. Annual Accounts and Notes\n- 5. Ap/fiendix\n\nThe main principles of the new pension system (accrual model, /flexible withdrawal and life expectancy adjustment) will be continued. The government notes that the new rules relating to age limits also need to be introduced to service pension schemes and contractual early retirement schemes. In particular, reference is made to the need for further examination of disability pensions from private service pension schemes and retirement pensions from de/fined-bene/fit pension schemes. The Committee has conducted a thorough review of the di/fferent service pension schemes and notes that there is a need for more knowledge of how these and contractual early retirement schemes a/ffect the distribution within the pension system and how the quality of the schemes varies between di/fferent groups.\n\nJust before the Pension Committee presented its report, the Norwegian Confederation of Trade Unions (LO) decided to demand better service pensions by doubling the minimum rate for mandatory service pensions from two to four per cent, as well as mandatory disability pensions.\n\n## Guaranteed pension products\n\nNew bu/ffer rules for guaranteed pension products in the private sector were adopted by the Norwegian Parliament in June 2023 and entered into force on 1 January 2024.\n\nThe amendment means that funds for additional statutory reserves and market value adjustment reserves are combined into a /flexible bu/ffer fund, that is distributed to individual contracts and can cover negative returns. There is no maximum limit as to how large the bu/ffer fund can be, but companies need to have guidelines in place regarding the size of the bu/ffer fund and bu/ffer funds exceeding what the company deems necessary may be allocated to customers as pro/fit. The /flexible bu/ffer fund policies may be subject to pro/fit-sharing between customers and companies.\n\nSimilar rules were introduced for municipal service pensions in 2022.\n\nStorebrand expects a somewhat increased allocation for classes with a higher risk due to the new rules and this will also lead to higher expectations of returns on the part of customers and shareholders. Storebrand therefore considers the rule change to be positive with regard to the management of paid-up policies. The solvency e/ffect of the rule change is expected to be neutral, as the positive e/ffect of the new bu/ffer regulations is counteracted by a negative e/ffect resulting from the increased allocation to asset classes with higher risk.\n\nThe Norwegian Parliament has asked the government to consider further changes to the regulations for paid-up policies that could bene/fit customers. This process will involve the a/ffected parties. The Ministry of Finance has issued a mandate for a working group, which is expected to submit its report in May 2024.\n\n## Municipal pension schemes\n\nStorebrand has submitted two complaints to the ESA, the surveillance body for the EEA agreement. Storebrand believes that municipalities and healthcare trusts that fail to put their service pension schemes out for tender violate the EEA regulations concerning public procurements. Storebrand also believes that KLP's practice of withholding equity accrued from customers that leave the company constitutes unlawful state aid, as KLP gains access to capital from municipalities and state-owned healthcare trusts on conditions to which other players in the market do not have access. The aim of the complaint is to accommodate competition in the municipal service pension market. Storebrand wants to remove the uncertainties that have been created in municipal Norway with regard to the procurement regulations and ensure that municipalities and healthcare trusts that move away from KLP bring all their funds with them, including accrued equity. We expect the ESA to address these complaints during 2024.",

Ap/fiendix\n\n## Corporate governance\n\nGood corporate governance is important to ensure that an enterprise can achieve its de/fined goals, including best possible utilisation of resources and good value creation. The Storebrand Group (hereafter referred to as Storebrand or the Group) continuously works to improve both the overall decision-making processes and the daily operations.\n\nStorebrand's corporate governance principles are in accordance with the Norwegian Code of Practice for Corporate Governance. The management and Board of Directors of Storebrand (the Board) conduct an annual review of Storebrand's corporate governance policies and compliance therewith. Storebrand reports in accordance with section 3-3b of the Norwegian Accounting Act and the Norwegian Code of Practice for Corporate Governance ('the recommendation').\n\nStorebrand publishes an integrated report that deals with the /financial, environmental, social conditions and corporate governance factors that are most material to Storebrand. Our double materiality analysis is addressed on page 54.\n\nStorebrand complies with the recommendation without signi/ficant deviations, except for a minor departure in Section 3 below, concerning board authorisation to make capital increases and acquire treasury shares. This is due to arrangements that had not been made for the annual general meeting to vote separately on each purpose to which the board authorisations apply.\n\n## Statement in accordance with the Norwegian Code of Practice for Corporate Governance (NUES) of 14-October-2021\n\nThe statement below describes how Storebrand complies with the 15 sections of the Code of Practice.\n\n- 1. Implementation of and reporting on corporate governance (No deviations from the Code of Practice)\n\nThe Board has decided that the Norwegian Code of Practice for Corporate Governance shall be followed.\n\nStorebrand complies with the Code of Practice without any signi/ficant exceptions. One minor deviation has been accounted for below under Section 3.\n\n## 2. Business (No deviations from the Code of Practice)\n\nStorebrand ASA is the parent company in a /financial Group and its statutory object is to manage its equity interests in Storebrand's subsidiaries in compliance with the current legislation. Storebrand's main business areas encompass pensions and savings, insurance and banking. The Articles of Association are available on the Storebrand website www.storebrand.no.\n\nThe market is kept updated on Storebrand's goals, strategies and creation of value through quarterly performance presentations and other thematic presentations. A dedicated capital market day was last held on 13 December 2023. You can read more about the company's goals and main strategies on page 18.\n\nStorebrand's strategy and corporate values are described in the framework 'Our driving force', which represents a common policy for how Storebrand will create value for customers, owners and society in general.\n\nStorebrand's goal is to deliver pro/fitable growth within established focus areas through simple and sustainable solutions. The Board conducts ongoing evaluations of the goals, strategy and risk pro/file. More information about 'Our driving force' and focus areas can be found on page 11.\n\nStorebrand will consider sustainability both as a corporate citizen, in our own operations and in our products and services. This is a key element of the Group's strategy and brand.\n\nStorebrand believes that companies considering environmental, social and corporate governance in their business activities reduce risk and create new opportunities for the business and its owners. We believe that sustainability considerations yield the best possible long-term, risk-adjusted future returns for our customers.",

Shareholder matters\n- 4. Annual Accounts and Notes\n- 5. Ap/fiendix\n\nThe Group's sustainability guidelines de/fine roles and responsibilities associated with sustainability work within the Group. Storebrand's sustainability principles summarise how the work is integrated into the overall goals, governance and control procedures. The principles were updated in 2023 and cover all aspects of the business, including investments, product development, procurement, employees and internal operations.\n\nThese principles are:\n\n- \u00b7  We aim for our business activities to contribute to achieving the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDG), as well as the related international and commitments made by the authorities in the countries we operate in\n- \u00b7  We prioritise our work on selected SDGs that we can make a signi/ficant impact on, and that signi/ficantly impact us.\n- \u00b7  We help our customers make more sustainable choices, through the services and products we o/ffer.\n- \u00b7  We are a responsible employer.\n- \u00b7  We take sustainability into account in all processes and decisions - from board and executive management, which bear overall responsibility, to execution by individual managers and employees.\n- \u00b7  We collaborate with customers, suppliers, authorities and partners in our sustainability e/fforts.\n- \u00b7  We are transparent about our sustainability e/fforts and about the results we achieve.\n\nThe Board approves Storebrand's strategic objectives for sustainability work, which are in line with these principles. The executive management team is responsible for realising and regularly report on progress for strategic goals within sustainability goals. Storebrand's strategic ambition is to set the agenda for sustainable /finance. This ambition a/ffects Storebrand's external engagement with society, internal operations and products and services. Our goals related to sustainability are reviewed at least once a year by the executive management team and the Board. The Board and the audit committee receive a monthly report on the status of sustainability e/fforts.\n\nWe identi/fied key material factors in the double materiality analysis conducted in 2023:\n\n- 1. Sustainable /finance\n- 2. Climate change\n- 3. Own employees\n- 4. Consumers and end-users\n- 5. Business conduct\n\nThe detailed goals, approach and results associated with these areas are presented later in this annual report.\n\nStorebrand believes that diversity enhances the business's relative ability to create value. Increased diversity is an important part of Storebrand's recruitment policy. Storebrand seeks to maintain and further develop an organisation characterised by equality and diversity. For further information, see page 115.\n\nStorebrand has established its own Code of Ethics. Guidelines for whistleblowing, social events, combating corruption, etc. have also been established. The Board is informed of reports in accordance with the adopted whistleblowing guidelines. The guidelines are publicly available on the Storebrand website.\n\n## 3. Equity and dividends (Deviation from the Code of Practice)\n\nThe Board of Storebrand ASA continuously monitors Storebrand's capital adequacy in light of its goals, strategy and risk pro/file. You can read more about Storebrand's capital situation and solvency on page 28 of the Board of Directors' Report.\n\nThe Board of Directors' ambition is to pay ordinary dividends per share of at least the same nominal amount as the previous year. Ordinary dividends are subject to a sustainable solvency margin of above 150 per cent. If the solvency margin is above 175 per cent, the Board of Directors intends to propose special dividends or share buybacks.\n\nThe dividend is adopted by the General Meeting, based on a proposal put forward by the Board of Directors. The General Meeting may, by simple majority, authorise the Board of Directors to distribute a dividend pursuant to Section 8-1, second paragraph of the Norwegian Public Limited Companies Act. This shall be based on the annual /financial statements adopted by the General Meeting. This authorisation may not be granted for a period longer than until the next Annual General Meeting. In addition, the authorisation shall be based on the company's adopted dividend policy. The General Meeting was not requested to provide such authorisation in 2023. Read more about Storebrand's dividend policy in the Group results and reporting 2023 section.\n\nStorebrand ASA seeks to have various tools available to achieve the best possible capital structure with a view to achieving good shareholder returns and /financial /flexibility. At the 2023 Annual General Meeting, the Board was granted authorisation to increase the share capital by issuing new shares with a total maximum value of NOK 232,748,930. This authorisation may be used for the acquisition of businesses in consideration for new shares or for increasing the share capital by other means. The Board of Directors may decide to waive the shareholders' preferential rights to subscribe for new shares in accordance with the authorisation. This authorisation may be used for one or more new issues. This authorisation is valid until the next Annual General Meeting.\n\nAt the same General Meeting, the Board of Directors was authorised to buy back shares for a nominal value of up to NOK 232,748,930. The total holdings of treasury shares must, however, never exceed 10 per cent of the share capital. The buyback of treasury shares may be a tool for the distribution of surplus capital to shareholders in addition to dividends. In addition, each year Storebrand ASA sells shares to employees from its own holdings in connection with the share purchase scheme and long-term incentive schemes for employees",

Shareholder matters\n- 4. Annual Accounts and Notes\n- 5. Ap/fiendix\n\nof Storebrand. Accordingly, it is appropriate to authorise the Board of Directors to buy shares in the market to cover the aforementioned needs or any other needs. This authorisation is valid until the next Annual General Meeting.\n\nThere are no provisions in Storebrand ASA's Articles of Association that regulate the buyback or issuance of shares.\n\nDeviation from the Code of Practice: The Board's authorisation to make capital increases and acquire treasury shares is limited to de/fined purposes, but arrangements had not been put in place for the General Meeting to vote separately on each such purpose.\n\n- 4. Equal treatment of shareholders and transactions with close associates (No deviations from the Code of Practice)\n\nStorebrand ASA has only one share class. There are no speci/fic restrictions on the ownership of shares or voting rights beyond the restrictions imposed by the Act on Financial Undertakings and Financial Groups. Through their work, the management and Board of Directors of Storebrand focus strongly on the equal treatment of shareholders.\n\nThe general competence rules for board members and executive personnel, including rules for the management of agreements with associates, may be found in the rules of procedure for the Board of Storebrand ASA, the rules of procedure for the boards of subsidiaries, the instructions for the CEO, the guidelines for con/flicts of interest and Storebrand's Code of Ethics. Board members must inform the company if they have direct or indirect quali/fied interests in an agreement concluded by one of the companies in the Storebrand Group. The Board shall ensure that agreements between the company and associates are balanced. The Board shall ensure that an independent third party assesses the value of transactions that are not insubstantial in nature. Furthermore, the rules of procedure for the Board stipulate that no board member may participate in discussions or a decision concerning matters that are of such material importance to them or a close associate that the member must be regarded as having a conspicuous personal or special /financial interest in the matter. Each board member has a responsibility to continuously assess whether or not such a situation exists.\n\nTransactions with close associates involving Storebrand's employees and other o/fficers of the Group are regulated by Storebrand's Code of Ethics. Employees shall, at their own initiative, immediately report con/flicts of interest that may arise to their immediate superior as soon as they become aware of such a situation. In general, an employee is de/fined as disquali/fied if circumstances exist that could result in others questioning the person's impartiality in relation to matters other than Storebrand's interests.\n\nIn the event of capital increases in accordance with the authorisation set out in Section 3 above, the Board may decide that the shareholders' preferential rights shall be waived.\n\nFor a complete report on shareholder matters, see page 177.\n\n## 5. Freely negotiable shares (No deviations from the Code of Practice)\n\nShares in Storebrand ASA are listed on Oslo B\u00f8rs (Oslo Stock Exchange). The shares are freely negotiable, and the Articles of Association thus do not contain any restrictions with regard to the negotiability of shares. All shares carry equal rights, cf. Section 4 above.\n\n## 6. General Meeting (No deviations from the Code of Practice)\n\n## General Meeting\n\nPursuant to the Articles of Association, Storebrand ASA's Annual General Meeting shall be held by the end of June each year. The General Meeting was held on 13 April 2023. All shareholders with a known address will receive notice of the General Meeting, which will be sent to shareholders no later than 21 days prior to the General Meeting. Pursuant to the Articles of Association in e/ffect at the time of the 2023 General Meeting, the registration deadline could be set no earlier than /five calendar days before the General Meeting. For future General Meetings, this deadline has been amended to two working days before the General Meeting as a result of an amendment to the Norwegian Public Limited Liability Companies Act e/ffective from 1 July 2023. In accordance with Storebrand's Articles of Association, the opportunity to make other agenda papers available on the Storebrand website is exercised, cf. Section 5-11a of the Norwegian Public Limited Companies Act. Shareholders may nevertheless demand to receive agenda papers by post.\n\nAll shareholders had the opportunity to participate digitally in the General Meeting. Storebrand's Articles of Association allow shareholders to vote in advance by means of electronic communication, cf. section 5-8b of the Norwegian Public Limited Companies Act.\n\nIt is also possible to vote by proxy. Provisions have been made so that the proxy form is linked to each individual matter to be considered. Wherever possible, we will seek to design the form so that it also allows voting for candidates who are to be elected to the Board and the Nomination Committee.  Further information about voting in advance, use of proxies and shareholders' rights to have matters discussed at the General Meeting is available both in the notice of the General Meeting and on Storebrand's website.\n\nElectronic voting and the use of proxies allow shareholders to vote without being physically present at the General Meeting. All shareholders therefore have the opportunity to exert an in/fluence on Storebrand by exercising their right to vote.\n\nThe Chairman of the Board, the Chairman of the Nomination Committee and the External Auditor must attend the General Meeting. The board members of Storebrand ASA are not obligated to attend, but are encouraged to. The Group CEO, parts of the executive management team and the Group Legal Director attend on behalf of management. The minutes of the General",

The General Meeting will be opened by the person designated by the Board. The Board of Directors proposes an independent meeting chair, to be elected by the General Meeting.\n\nThe General Meeting shall:\n\n- \u00b7  consider the annual accounts, consisting of the income statement, the balance sheet and the annual report,\n- \u00b7  including the consolidated income statement and balance sheet, as well as the auditor's report,\n- \u00b7  decide on the adoption of the income statement and balance sheet,\n- \u00b7  decide on the adoption of the consolidated income statement and balance sheet,\n- \u00b7  decide on the allocation of pro/fit or manner of covering losses in\n- \u00b7  accordance with the adopted balance sheet and upon the distribution of any dividends,\n- \u00b7  elect the auditor,\n- \u00b7  appoint members to the Nomination Committee, including the Chairman of the Nomination Committee,\n- \u00b7  elect members to the Board of Directors, including the Chairman of the Board Directors,\n- \u00b7  consider the Board of Directors' Statement on the Fixing of Salaries and Other Remuneration to Executive Personnel,\n- \u00b7  adopt the remuneration of the members of the Board of Directors and board committees,\n- \u00b7  adopt the remuneration of the members of the Nomination Committee,\n- \u00b7  adopt the remuneration of the auditor,\n- \u00b7  and transact any other business listed on the agenda\n\nDecisions are generally made on the basis of an ordinary majority. Pursuant to Norwegian law, however, a quali/fied majority is required for certain decisions, including decisions on setting aside pre-emptive rights in connection with any share issues, mergers, spino/ffs, amendments to the Articles of Association or authorisations to increase or reduce the share capital. Such decisions require approval by at least two-thirds of both the votes cast and the share capital represented at the General Meeting.\n\n## 7. Nomination Committee (No deviations from the Code of Practice)\n\nThe Nomination Committee of Storebrand ASA is required by the Articles of Association and consists of a minimum of three and a maximum of /five members. For the 20232024 election period, the Nomination Committee has consisted of four members.\n\nThe Chairman of the Nomination Committee and the other members are elected annually by the General Meeting.\n\nThe majority of the Nomination Committee is independent of the Board of Directors and the management. The Nomination Committee is composed with a view to safeguarding the interests of the community of shareholders. In the General Meeting's rules of procedure for the Nomination Committee, there are provisions concerning the rotation of members of the Nomination Committee\n\nThe Articles of Association stipulate that the Nomination Committee should work in accordance with the rules of procedure adopted by the General Meeting. The Nomination Committee's rules of procedure were last revised at the Annual General Meeting in spring 2022. In accordance with the rules of procedure, the Nomination Committee shall, for example, give attention to the following when preparing nominations for candidates for the companies' Board: expertise, experience, capacity, gender distribution, independence, and the interests of the community of shareholders. More information about the members has been published on Storebrand's website. The Nomination Committee annually writes to the company's 30 largest shareholders with an invitation to suggest candidates for the Board of Directors and Nomination Committee.  A corresponding request to the shareholders is published on the company's website.\n\nThe Nomination Committee mandate pursuant to the Articles of Association is to propose candidates and remuneration for the Board of Directors and Nomination Committee, through recommendations to the General Meeting.\n\nAn attempt is made to adapt the remuneration of the members of the Nomination Committee to the nature of their duties and time spent on committee work.\n\n8. The composition and independence of the Board of Directors (No deviations from the Code of Practice)\n\nThe Articles of Association stipulate that between /five and seven board members shall be elected by the General Meeting based on nominations from the Nomination Committee. The Chair of the Board shall be elected separately by the General Meeting.\n\nTwo members, or three members if the General Meeting elects six or seven board members, shall be elected by and from among the employees. The board members are elected for one year at a time. The executive management is not represented on the Board of Directors. At the end of 2023, the Board of Directors consisted of ten members (six men and four women).\n\nNone of the members elected by the General Meeting have any employment, professional or consultancy relationship with Storebrand beyond their appointment to the Board of Directors. The backgrounds of the individual board members are described on page 314 of the annual report and on Storebrand's website. The composition of the Board of Directors satis/fies the independence requirements set forth in the Code of Practice. There were no instances of disquali/fication during the consideration of matters by the Board in 2023. As part of the subchapter on the Board of Directors, shareholder-elected and employee-elected board members highlighted. All shareholder-elected board members are independent. None of the board members have held o/ffice for more than ten years. An overview of the number of shares in Storebrand ASA owned by members of governing bodies as of 31 December 2023 is included in the notes on the /financial statements for Storebrand ASA (Information about close associates) on page 300.",

Work of the Board of Directors (no deviations from the Code of Practice)\n\n## Duties of the Board of Directors\n\nIn 2023, a total of 14 board meetings were held. There were no signi/ficant absences from board meetings. Storebrand's future strategy is discussed at the Board's annual strategy meeting, which establishes guidelines for the management's preparation of plans and budgets in connection with the annual /financial plan, which must be approved by the Board.\n\nThe Board shall stay informed of Storebrand's /financial position and development and it shall ensure that the company's value creation and pro/fitability are safeguarded in the best possible manner on behalf of the owners and society - and in line with the sustainability strategy. The Board continuously assesses the company's impact on the environment, people, etc. The Board shall also ensure that the activities are subjected to adequate control and ensure that Storebrand has adequate capital based on the scope of, and risks associated with, its activities.\n\nThe Board has established guidelines that give board members and senior employees a duty to familiarise Storebrand with the essential interests they may have in matters that the Board is to consider. This also applies to interests that do not imply disquali/fication, but which may be necessary to take into account when matters are considered. Reference is made to Section 4 above.\n\nThe work of the Board is regulated by special rules of procedure for the Board, which are reviewed annually. In order to ensure sound and well-considered decisions, importance is attached to ensuring that meetings of the Board are well prepared so that all the members can participate in the decision-making process. The Board prepares an annual schedule for its meetings and the topics it will consider. The agenda for the next board meeting is normally presented to the Board based on the approved schedule for the year and a list of matters carried forward from previous meetings. The /final agenda is /fixed in consultation with the Chair of the Board. Time is periodically set aside to evaluate board meetings without the management present. The Board is entitled to appoint external advisers to help it with its work whenever it deems this necessary. The Board has also drawn up instructions for the CEO.\n\nThe Board conducts an annual evaluation of its work and methods, which provides a basis for changes and measures. The report from the Board's evaluation, or relevant excerpts, will be made available to the Nomination Committee, which will use the evaluation in its work. The Board is covered by the company's ongoing board liability insurance. This is placed with insurers with a solid rating. The insurer will, within the limits of the insurance coverage, compensate loss of assets arising from claims against the insured for personal management liability during the insurance period.\n\n## Board committees\n\nThe Board has established four sub-committees in the form of the Compensation Committee, Audit Committee, Risk Committee and Strategy Committee. The committees consist of three to four board members,\n\ntwo to three shareholder-elected board members and one-employee elected board member. The composition helps ensure a thorough and independent consideration of matters concerning internal control, /financial reporting, sustainability reporting, strategic assessments, risk assessment and remuneration of executive personnel. The committees are preparatory and advisory working committees and assist the Board with the preparation of matters for consideration. Decisions are made, however, by the full Board. The committees are able to hold meetings and consider matters at their own initiative without the involvement of company management.\n\nThe Compensation Committee assists the Board with all matters concerning the Chief Executive O/fficer's remuneration. The Committee monitors the remuneration of Storebrand's executive personnel and proposes guidelines for determining executive personnel remuneration and the Board's statement on the determination of executive personnel remuneration, which is presented to the General Meeting annually. In addition, the Committee safeguards the areas required by the Compensation Regulations in Norway and Sweden. The Compensation Committee held three meetings in 2023.\n\nThe Audit Committee assists the Board by reviewing, evaluating and, where necessary, proposing appropriate measures with respect to the Group's overall controls, /financial, sustainability and operational reporting, risk management/control and internal and external auditing. The Audit Committee held nine meetings in 2023, including a joint meeting with the Risk Committee. The external and internal auditors participate in the meetings. The majority of the committee members are independent of the company.\n\nThe main task of the Risk Committee is to prepare matters to be considered by the Group's Board of Directors in the area of risk, with a special focus on Storebrand's risk appetite and risk strategy, including the investment strategy. The Committee should contribute forwardlooking decision-making support related to the Board's discussion of risk taking, /financial forecasts and the treatment of risk reporting. The Risk Committee held eight meetings in 2023, including a joint meeting with the Audit Committee.\n\nThe main task of the Strategy Committee is to prepare matters for the Board in relation to strategy, with a particular focus on the Group's work on strategy, including mergers and acquisitions. The Committee will provide forward-looking decision support in connection with the Board's consideration of the company's strategic direction and targets. The Strategy Committee held /five meetings in 2023.\n\n## 10. Risk management and internal control (No deviations from the Code of Practice)\n\n## Management and control\n\nThe Board of Directors has drawn up general policies and guidelines for management and control. These policies deal with the Board's responsibility for determining Storebrand's appetite for risk and risk pro/file, approval of the organisation of the business, assignment of operational areas of responsibility and authority,",

The Board of Directors has drawn up instructions for Storebrand's subsidiaries, which are to ensure that they implement and comply with Storebrand's management and control policies and guidelines.\n\nThe Investor Relations guidelines ensure reliable, timely and identical information is issued to investors, lenders and other stakeholders in the securities market.\n\nThe Sustainability guidelines ensure that the Group's strategy, products and services are developed and operated consistently and in line with regulatory requirements and obligations arising from national and international frameworks endorsed by Storebrand. The guidelines also de/fine responsibilities for sustainability work throughout the Group, within the three dimensions of corporate citizen, internal operations and products and services.\n\nAs an extension of the general policies and guidelines, a Code of Ethics has been drawn up that applies to all employees and representatives of Storebrand, in addition to corporate rules for areas such as risk management, /financial reporting, handling insider information and share trading by primary insiders. Guidelines are also provided on the handling of con/flicts of interest, personal data, cybercrime, emergency response plans, anti-money laundering and other /financial crime. Storebrand is subject to statutory supervision in the countries where it has operations that require a licence, including by the Financial Supervisory Authority of Norway, as well as its own supervisory bodies and external auditor.\n\n## Risk management and internal control\n\nThe assessment and management of risk are integrated into Storebrand's corporate governance. This management system shall ensure that there is a correlation between goals and actions at all levels of Storebrand and creating value for Storebrand's shareholders.\n\nStorebrand's /financial and operational goals are de/fined annually in a board-approved /financial plan.  The plan builds on separate decisions regarding risk appetite, risk strategy and investment strategies and includes three-year /financial forecasts, budgets and action plans. The Board of Directors receives ongoing reports on the status of the strategy implementation.\n\nStorebrand Compass is the company's monitoring tool and provides comprehensive reports for management and the Board concerning /financial and operational targets. In addition, the Board of Directors receives risk reports from the risk management function, which monitors the development of key /figures for risk, solvency, etc.\n\nRisk assessment forms part of the managerial responsibilities in the organisation. The purpose of this is to identify, assess and manage risks that can hinder a unit's ability to achieve its goals. The process covers both\n\nthe risk of incurring losses and failing pro/fitability linked to economic downturns, changes in the general conditions, changed customer behaviour, etc., and the risk of incurring losses due to inadequate or failing internal processes, systems, human error or external events. Developments in the /financial markets are important risk factors in relation to Storebrand's earnings and solvency position. In addition to assessing the e/ffects of sudden shifts in the equity markets or interest rate levels (stress tests), scenario analysis is used to estimate the e/ffect of various sequences of events in the /financial markets on Storebrand's /financial performance and solvency. This provides important premises for the Board's general discussion of risk appetite, risk allocation and capital adequacy.\n\nIndependent control functions for risk management and compliance and actuarial duties have been established for the Storebrand Group overall and for the respective Group companies.\n\nStorebrand has a common internal audit function, which conducts an independent review of the robustness of the management model. The internal audit function's instructions and annual plan are determined by the Board pursuant to the current legislation, regulations and international standards. The internal audit function reports to the Risk Committee and Board of Storebrand ASA and the boards of Group companies.\n\nThe appraisal of all Storebrand employees is integrated into corporate governance and is designed to ensure that the adopted strategies are implemented. The policies for earning and paying any variable remuneration to Storebrand's risk managers comply with the regulations relating to remuneration in /financial institutions, cf. Section 12 below. The Chief Risk O/fficer and employees with control functions related to risk management, internal control and compliance only have /fixed salaries.\n\n## Financial information and Storebrand's accounting process\n\nStorebrand publishes four interim /financial statements, in addition to the ordinary annual /financial statements. The /financial statements must satisfy legal and regulatory requirements, be prepared in accordance with the adopted accounting policies and be published according to the schedule adopted by the Board of Storebrand ASA.\n\nStorebrand's consolidated /financial statements are prepared by the Consolidated Financial Statements unit, which reports to the Group's CFO. Key executives in the Consolidated Financial Statements unit receive a /fixed annual remuneration that is not a/ffected by Storebrand's /financial earnings. The work involved in the preparation of the /financial statements is organised in such a way that the Consolidated Financial Statements unit does not carry out valuations of investment assets. Instead, it exercises a control function in relation to the accounting processes of the Group companies.\n\nA series of risk assessment and control measures have been established in connection with the preparation of the /financial statements.

Shareholder matters\n- 4. Annual Accounts and Notes\n- 5. Ap/fiendix\n\netc., are described in a separate document (Valuation Items Memo). The Board's Audit Committee conducts a preparatory review of interim /financial statements and annual /financial statements, focusing in particular on the discretionary valuations and estimates that have been made prior to consideration by the Board.\n\nMonthly and quarterly operating reports are prepared in which the results by business area and product area are analysed and assessed against set budgets. The operating reports are reconciled against other /financial reporting.\n\n## 11. Remuneration of the Board of Directors (No deviations from the Code of Practice)\n\nThe General Meeting determines the Board's remuneration annually on the basis of the recommendations of the Nomination Committee. The fees paid to the members of the Board are not linked to earnings, option schemes or similar arrangements. Members of the Board and board committees do not receive incentive-based remuneration; instead, they receive a /fixed annual compensation, either per year or per meeting the member attends, or a combination of such remuneration. The shareholderelected members of the Board do not participate in Storebrand's pension schemes. None of the shareholderelected members of the Board carry out any duties for Storebrand beyond their appointment to the Board. More detailed information on the remuneration, loans and shareholdings of board members may be found in notes 20 (Group) and 15 (ASA) of the notes on the accounts. Board members are encouraged to hold shares in the company.\n\n## 12. Remuneration of executive personnel (No deviations from the Code of Practice)\n\nThe Board determines the structure of the remuneration of executive personnel at Storebrand and guidelines on the remuneration (previously the executive personnel statement) are presented to the General Meeting for approval every four years or in the event of material changes. The remuneration consists of /fixed salaries, pension schemes and other fringe bene/fits deemed to be natural in a /financial group. The aim of the remuneration is to motivate greater e/fforts to ensure long-term value creation and resource utilisation in the company. In the opinion of the Board, the overall remuneration shall be competitive, but not leading.\n\nThe salaries of executive management are determined based on the position's responsibilities and level of complexity. Regular comparisons with equivalent roles in other companies in the /financial industry are made in order to ensure that the salary level is competitive.\n\nStorebrand's guidelines for /financial remuneration are adapted to the company's business strategy. The starting point is a /fixed salary as an instrument of the overall /financial compensation, but variable remuneration is also used to some extent in certain parts of the business. Executive management are only paid a /fixed salary. To ensure that the Group's executive management team and\n\nselected executive personnel have incentive schemes that coincide with the long-term interests of the owners, a signi/ficant proportion of the gross /fixed salary is linked to the purchase of physical Storebrand shares, with a lock-in period of three years.\n\nExecutive personnel are encouraged to hold shares in Storebrand ASA, even beyond the lock-in period.\n\nStorebrand's strategy and operational targets form the basis for the annual individual assessments of remuneration of employees. This helps to further strengthen agreement between the owners and the management. Sustainable solutions are a key aspect of Storebrand's business strategy and form part of employee assessments.\n\nMore detailed information about the remuneration of executive personnel can be found in notes 20 (Group) and 15 (ASA). Further information can also be found in the Board's guidelines on remuneration and report on salaries and remuneration to executive personnel, which is available on the Storebrand website.\n\n## 13. Information and communication (No deviations from the Code of Practice)\n\nThe Board has issued guidelines for the company's reporting of /financial and other information and for contact with shareholders other than through the General Meeting. Storebrand's reporting with regard to sustainable investments goes beyond the statutory requirements. Storebrand's /financial calendar is published on the internet and in the company's annual report. Financial and sustainability information is published in the quarterly and annual reports, as described above under Section 10 - Financial information and Storebrand's accounting process. Documentation that is published is available on the Storebrand website. All reporting is based on the principle of transparency and takes into account the need for the equal treatment of all participants in the securities markets and the rules concerning good stock exchange practices, which is described in section 4. Storebrand has its own guidelines for handling insider information, see also Section 10 - Management and control above.\n\n## 14. Takeovers (No deviations from the Code of Practice)\n\nThe Board of Directors has prepared guidelines for how to act in the event of a possible takeover bid for the company. These guidelines are based on the Board of Directors ensuring the transparency of the process and that all shareholders are treated equally and given an opportunity to evaluate the bid that has been made. It follows from the guidelines that the Board of Directors will evaluate the bid and issue a statement on the Board's opinion of the bid, in addition to obtaining a valuation from an independent expert. In addition, the Board of Directors will, in the event of any takeover bid, seek to maximise shareholders' assets wherever possible. The guidelines cover the situation before and after a bid is made.",

Shareholder matters\n- 4. Annual Accounts and Notes\n- 5. Ap/fiendix\n\n## 15. Auditor (No deviations from the Code of Practice)\n\nThe external auditor is elected by the General Meeting of Storebrand ASA and is responsible for the /financial auditing. The external auditor presents an audit report in connection with the /financial statement. The external auditor attends board meetings at which /financial statements are reviewed and all meetings of the Audit Committee, unless the items on the agenda do not require the presence of the auditor. The external auditor shall rotate the person responsible for the audit assignment every seven years and Storebrand must publish a call for tenders to select an audit company every ten years as a minimum. The external auditor's work and independence are evaluated annually by the Board's Audit Committee. The auditor shall also meet with the Board of Directors at least once a year without the management being present. The other companies in Storebrand use the same auditor as Storebrand ASA.\n\n## Other\n\nAs one of the largest investors in the Norwegian stock market, Storebrand has considerable potential in/fluence over the development of listed companies. Storebrand attaches importance to exercising its ownership in listed companies on the basis of straightforward and consistent ownership principles that place considerable emphasis on sustainability. Storebrand applies the Norwegian Code of Practice for Corporate Governance in this role. Storebrand has had an administrative Corporate Governance Committee since 2006. The Committee is responsible for ensuring good corporate governance across Storebrand.\n\nStorebrand ASA's ambitions for sustainability are Groupwide and include sustainable investments, as set out in the Group's sustainability strategy.

Ap/fiendix\n\n## Storebrand's sustainability agenda\n\nThe /financial sector is crucial if we are to succeed in eradicating extreme poverty, reducing social inequalities, halting the loss of nature and halting climate change. According to the UN, investments of up to NOK 68,000 billion are required each year up to 2030 to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals.\n\nFinancial institutions play an important role through investments, lending activities and insurance. The sector decides who gets access to private capital and can contribute to the /financing of new technology and solutions.\n\nStorebrand's ambition is to set the agenda for sustainable /finance.\n\nAs a broad /financial services company and one of the largest asset managers in the Nordic region, Storebrand plays an important role in /financing the transition to a sustainable society. Our sustainability work is of great importance to the Group, our customers and society in general. We contribute to /financial security and wellness through good management of customers' funds, payment of life/disability and non-life insurance and /financing home purchases. We believe that good sustainability work helps the Group deliver the best possible long-term risk-\n\nadjusted return to customers and owners, and is therefore important for achieving our commercial goals.\n\nStorebrand's corporate strategy is built around our purpose and vision of delivering /financial security and wellness to individuals and companies. We want to motivate customers to make good /financial choices for the future. We create value for customers, owners and society by providing sustainable solutions so that customers can have a future to look forward to.\n\nOur sustainability work is threefold:\n\n- \u00b7  Storebrand as a responsible corporate citizen\n- \u00b7  Sustainability in own operations\n- \u00b7  Sustainability in products and services\n\nStorebrand as a responsible corporate citizen Storebrand will take an active role in contributing to positive social development. We can do this through cooperation on sustainable development in national, local and international initiatives, as an active owner and investor, and by participating in public debate. Our ambition is to be a signi/ficant contributor to change in the real economy. We will be transparent in our sustainability work. 13)",

Ap/fiendix\n\n## Participation in alliances and networks\n\nStorebrand participates in national and global networks and alliances to help accelerate the transformation of society and share insight that provides a better basis for decision-making for our customers. Through the networks, we will contribute to de/fining best practices for sustainability work both in the /financial industry and the private sector in general.\n\nStorebrand has signed and follows the UN Global Compact's guidelines for responsible and sustainable business conduct, as well as the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises. We also support the UN human rights conventions and ILO core conventions, the UN Environment Conventions and the UN Convention against Corruption.\n\nStorebrand has a particularly important role as asset owner and asset manager. Through cooperation with other players, Storebrand can exercise greater power in meetings with partners and companies we invest in to set expectations of change that are in line with international and internal obligations. International initiatives such as the Net Zero Asset Owner Alliance, the Net Zero Asset Manager Alliance, the UN Principles for Responsible Investments (PRI) and Climate Action 100+ are examples of such cooperation.\n\nThis illustrates our strong commitment to SDG 17: working together to achieve the goals. In addition, through stakeholder dialogue and communication, we want to in/fluence SDG 13 (climate action), SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production) and SDG 8 (decent work and economic growth).\n\n## Stakeholder dialogue and participation in public debate\n\nStorebrand will actively participate in the public debate on topics de/fined in the Group's communication strategy. We want to contribute to ambitious and long-term policies and proactive measures in the private sector. Storebrand will in/fluence climate and nature policy through dialogue with authorities, industry organisations and other stakeholders. We want to promote climate-friendly policies that can help ensure that our activities are in line with the Paris Agreement. We want the authorities to implement policy measures that help reduce the number of disabled people.\n\n## Support for projects that bene/fit society\n\nStorebrand supports local projects that contribute to a future to look forward to. Among other things, through the grants 'Vi heier p\u00e5' 14) and SPPs 'Klart du kan' 15) , Storebrand contributes with funding projects that promote a positive societal development.\n\n## Sustainability in own operations\n\nStorebrand has de/fined and operates according to a set of basic principles for sustainability work:\n\n- \u00b7  We aim for our business activities to contribute to achieving the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDG), as well as related international and commitments made by the authorities of the countries we operate in\n- \u00b7  We prioritise our work on selected SDGs that we can make a signi/ficant impact on, and that signi/ficantly impact us.\n- \u00b7  We help our customers to make more sustainable choices, through the services and products we o/ffer.\n- \u00b7  We are a responsible employer.\n- \u00b7  We take sustainability into account in all processes and decisions - from overall responsibility by board and executive management, to execution by individual managers and employees.\n- \u00b7  We collaborate with customers, suppliers, authorities and partners in our e/fforts to achieve sustainability.\n- \u00b7  We are transparent about both our sustainability e/fforts and the results we achieve.\n\nFor the fourth consecutive year, Storebrand was included in the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index in 2023, meaning we were rated as one of the world's leading publicly traded companies in sustainability work. Storebrand will contribute to real change in society by setting clear requirements and collaborating with suppliers.  Through our procurement activities, we shall contribute to responsible development and to ensuring that human rights and labour rights are not violated.\n\nWe've identi/fied three sustainability goals that we can signi/ficantly impact through how we manage our HR, procurement and business processes. Key /figures that show how far we have come in this work are shown at the end of relevant chapters in this report.\n\nWe work actively for equal opportunities and gender balance in working life and society (target 5.5).\n\nWe aim to ensure decent work for all our employees and equal pay for equal work (target 8.5).\n\nWe aim to protect labour rights and promote a safe and secure working environment for all employees, contractors and suppliers (target 8.8).\n\nWe work continuously to encourage and expand access to banking, insurance and /financial services for all (target 8.10).\n\nWe are strengthening our ability to withstand and adapt to climate-related hazards and natural disasters in our operations and investments (target 13.1).\n\nWe incorporate measures to reduce the scale and impact of climate change into our policies, strategies and plans (target 13.2).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Strategic and operational implementation\n\nThe Board of Directors of Storebrand ASA sets out the Group's overall ambitions and principles for our sustainability work.

In 2023, these guidelines, as well as our sustainability management process, were updated.\n\nStrategic and operational implementation of sustainability shall be anchored in and followed up by the management and the boards of the Group and its subsidiaries. The boards of directors of subsidiaries have overall responsibility for ensuring that the company works with and reports on sustainability in accordance with national laws, legislation, and regulations from the EU, as well as obligations and ambitions Storebrand has undertaken. As part of the annual strategy process, the boards will consider the company's sustainability strategy.\n\nBy de/fining ambitions in this strategy and following up on these in all our subsidiaries, Storebrand aims to be a role model and a credible driving force in sustainability work. Expressed goals shall be followed up in ongoing corporate governance and necessary measures shall be introduced to achieve the goals.\n\nThe results of Storebrand's double materiality analysis shall form part of the Group's strategy and risk processes.\n\nStorebrand must comply with internal and external regulations in addition to following up voluntary commitments to safeguard our position as a socially responsible company that helps /financing the transition to a more sustainable society. The regulatory landscape of sustainable /finance is constantly evolving. This requires that we have both the capacity and expertise to understand and translate regulations and voluntary commitments into actual measures and practical implementation.\n\n## Sustainability in products and services\n\nThe belief that sustainability considerations provide the best possible risk-adjusted future returns for clients is an important part of our investment strategy. We will explore commercial sustainability opportunities in all our /financial products and services. Not taking climate, nature and social issues into account can represent a major risk of stranded assets.\n\nSustainability is a strategic enabler in the business strategy and shall in support the Group's  achievement for the following strategic positions:\n\n- \u00b7  Leading provider of occupational pensions in Norway and Sweden\n- \u00b7  'Nordic Powerhouse' in asset management\n- \u00b7  Growing challenger in the Norwegian retail market\n\nThe Board of Directors of Storebrand ASA has set overall ambitions in the Group's strategy for sustainability work, which sets the framework for the subsidiaries' sub-strategies. All subsidiaries have speci/fic ambitions and goals for sustainability work, meaning that there are separate ambitions and goals for the product areas pension, asset management/investment products, issuance of bonds, non-life and life insurance, and banking. In this report, we describe in detail our work on sustainability in our investments and insurance in the chapters 'A driving force for sustainable investments' and 'Sustainability in insurance'.\n\nIn 2023, Prospera ranked us /first in the sustainable investments category Norway. In 2023, both Storebrand and SPP received top scores in S\u00f6derberg & Partners' ranking of Norwegian and Swedish life insurance companies' work with sustainability. In Norway, our nonlife insurance business also received top marks from the same actor, as the only non-life insurance company with green light in all sub-categories.",

Ap/fiendix\n\n## Materiality analysis and material topics\n\nStorebrand regularly conducts materiality analyses to identify which topics are most strategically signi/ficant for our business and stakeholders. The signi/ficant topics are reviewed annually and will be updated if we identify new themes or conditions that a/ffect our risks or opportunities.\n\nFrom the 2024 /financial year, many European companies will be required by law to identify and prioritise material environmental, social and governance issues.\n\nThe materiality analysis guides our priorities and ambitions in sustainability work and in/fluences how our sustainability reporting is structured. The analysis is included in the risk assessments and strategy development processes.\n\nIn 2023, we conducted a new materiality analysis in line with the principles of double materiality 16) . Our material\n\n## 2017-2018\n\n## 2019-2022\n\n## 2023\n\n- \u00b7  Financial capital and our investment universe\n- \u00b7  Customer and community relations\n- \u00b7  Our people and systems\n- \u00b7  Financial capital and investment universe\n- \u00b7  Customer relations\n- \u00b7  Our people\n- \u00b7  Keeping our house in order\n- \u00b7  Sustainable /finance\n- \u00b7  Climate change\n- \u00b7  Own employees\n- \u00b7  Consumers and end-users\n- \u00b7  Business conduct\n\n16)  Double materiality is a fundamental principle in ESRS reporting and sets guidelines for what enterprises should report on in order to report in accordance with CSRD. The de/finition is described in Set 1 ESRS European Sustainability Reporting Standards: https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=OJ:L\\_202302772\n\ntopics are reviewed annually and will be updated if we identify new themes or conditions that a/ffect our risks or opportunities.\n\nBelow is an overview of Storebrand's most important topics in recent years.\n\nDouble materiality helps companies identify and report on how sustainability issues a/ffect and are a/ffected by a business. Storebrand must consider both its impact on the environment and people, and how environmental and social conditions may a/ffect Storebrand's /financial situation and value creation.\n\nSustainability-related topics present both risks and opportunities. Storebrand's sustainability strategy aims to reduce risk and realise opportunities, both for the outside world and for Storebrand.",

Impacts may be directly caused by our own operations, products and services, or directly and indirectly linked through our business relationships.\n\n## Financial materiality\n\nA sustainability-related topic is /financially material if it triggers or can be expected to trigger material economic e/ffects on the business.  We assessed the /financial importance of various factors both qualitatively and quantitatively, and used quantitative thresholds for each of the legal entities. The thresholds are set using speci/fic percentages on /financial key /figures, such as gross operating pro/fit and equity. Each topic was assessed by estimating the /financial risk and/or opportunity and the probability of occurrence in the short, medium and long term.\n\n## Process\n\nDouble materiality is assessed based on Storebrand's operations and input from stakeholders, i.e. parties that can a/ffect or be a/ffected by our operations. The stakeholders we considered most relevant were:\n\n- \u00b7  A/ffected stakeholders: customers, employees, suppliers as well as nature as a silent stakeholder.\n- \u00b7  User stakeholders: shareholders, governments and NGOs.\n- 17)  Materiality analysis 2023\n\n## Environment\n\n- 1 Climate change\n- 2 Pollution\n- 3 Water and marine resources\n- 4 Biodiversity and ecosystems\n- 5 Resource use and circular economy\n\nSocial\n\n- 1 Own employees\n- 2 Workers in the value chain\n- 3 A/ffected communities\n- 4 Consumers and end-users\n\nGovernance\n\n- 1 Business conduct\n\nEntity-speci/fic material topic\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSustainable /finance\n\n- 2 Financial inclusion\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nInterviews with representatives of various stakeholder groups were conducted, in addition to analyses of guidelines, annual reports and trends. The materiality analysis is thus based on market trends, political trends and input from internal and external stakeholders.\n\nThe material topics are ranked based on the importance of the two di/fferent types of materiality. The ranking is based on quantitative scoring, qualitative interviews (internal and external), and input from management teams, Group management and the Board's Audit Committee.\n\nOur double materiality analysis from 2023 forms the basis for this sustainability report and is available on our website 17) . The analysis covers our own operations, and the products areas asset management, insurance and banking.\n\nThrough the materiality analysis, we identi/fied /five material topics that we describe and report on in the following sections:\n\n- 1.

The analysis included ESG standards/ratings, megatrends, regulatory developments and Storebrand's own strategy and risk assessment. The assessment was identi/fied per business area; insurance, banking and asset management, as well as own operations.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2\n\n## Assessment of material impacts, risks, and opportunities:\n\nTo prioritise the most signi/ficant topics, an initial list was assessed by external and internal stakeholders on a scale of 0-5. The results for the various business areas and own operations were aggregated and resulted in a Group-wide assessment.\n\nValidate and anchor material topics with management and the Audit Committee: Anchoring the process was important to ensure feedback and quality assurance of priorities, including input from the risk and strategy areas. The results were ultimately validated by various management groups and the Audit Committee.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\nImplementation of material topics and integration in the 2023 annual report: The /final phase in the implementation of the material topics was the integration of the results in this year's annual report.

It plays an important role in /financing the transition to a sustainable society through investments, lending and insurance. This is recognised and institutionalised through the EU Green Deal, which aims to ensure a climate-neutral and competitive Europe. One of ten initiatives in the Green Deal is about /financing the transition by channelling capital towards more sustainable activities, establishing transparency about companies' sustainability e/fforts and integrating sustainability into risk assessments.\n\nAs a /financial player, Storebrand can both in/fluence developments in society, and is a/ffected by changes in the environment, social conditions and governance in society. We have a fundamental belief that investments in companies that are well positioned to solve the\n\n57\n\nchallenges of the UN Sustainable Development Goals will provide  better long-term risk-adjusted future return for our customers. We also reduce exposure to activities that may impact society and the environment negative. The ambition of setting the agenda for sustainable /finance involves a high potential /financial risk for Storebrand. The economic signi/ficance associated with sustainable /finance includes the ability to gain and maintain market share as a result of increased demand and interest from stakeholders.\n\nThis chapter describes how Storebrand manages our impacts, risks and opportunities in sustainable /finance through our products and services, described in more detail in the sections: A driving force for sustainable investments and Sustainability in insurance.",

In 2022, Storebrand Livsforsikring issued NOK 2.7 billion in green bonds, while Storebrand Boligkreditt issued NOK 5.5 billion. In 2023, the issuance from Storebrand Boligkreditt was increased from NOK 5.5 billion to NOK 7.5 billion.\n\nIn 2023, Storebrand allocated NOK 4 billion to green bonds, of which NOK 2 billion was allocated to the bonds issued by Storebrand Livsforsikring in 2022 and NOK 2 billion was allocated to green mortgages through Storebrand Boligkreditt.\n\nThe allocations were made in projects within infrastructure, real estate and green mortgages, which satisfy Storebrand's framework.

Ap/fiendix\n\n## A driving force for sustainable investments\n\n## Why sustainability in investments\n\nOur core business - long-term savings, pensions and insurance - requires that we work to ensure that our customers have a future to look forward to. This forms the basis of our work with investments and asset management.\n\nWe consider sustainability in our investments because we believe it will ensure a good long-term risk-adjusted future return for our clients. Investors need to understand business risks and opportunities, and build strategies based on this knowledge. Environmental, social or governance issues are an important part of this knowledge and may materially impact the value of investments.\n\nHumanity is facing major challenges in climate, nature and social conditions, and a signi/ficant risk that they will accelerate rapidly. This has been established by research from the UN organisations UNDP and IPCC, among others. This has major implications, both for the planet and our /financial portfolios.\n\nIn order to address the systemic challenges, governance structures in both business and politics must be strengthened and changed to ensure a just transition to a sustainable economy.  Companies and investors must increasingly engage with issues such as climate and nature challenges, living wages, corporate governance and transparency, as well as due diligence on human rights and working conditions. Increased demands and regulations from authorities reinforce this need. As an investor, we must invest in companies that are part of the solutions and\n\nbe able to be a driving force to ensure that the companies we invest in create and comply with plans for transition.\n\n## Our strategy\n\nStorebrand shall ensure the best possible return for customers and owners, and at the same time be a driving force for lasting change in the way companies are managed. We believe that investments in companies that are well-positioned to deliver solutions to the UNs Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) will deliver better risk-adjusted returns for our customers over time. We believe that companies that manage sustainability risks and opportunities will have a potential competitive advantage while contributing to a positive development.\n\nOur ambition is for our investments to contribute to the achievement of the SDGs without causing harm or having an adverse impact on society and the environment.\n\nHowever, sustainable investments are never simple or black and white. Handling dilemmas is crucial. One example is the need to urgently develop sources of renewable energy without compromising the rights of indigenous peoples. Another example is the challenge of ensuring living wages for workers across supply chains that span a wide variety of locations, cost levels and regulatory domains.\n\n## Strategic goals\n\nStorebrand has committed to several sustainabilityrelated goals for our investments and has established several short-term targets, as well as long-term targets until 2050.",

We utilise several tools:\n\n- \u00b7  ESG risk rating\n- \u00b7  Sustainability score\n- \u00b7  Solution companies and solution company database\n- \u00b7  Principal Adverse Impact (PAI) indicators according to SFDR - information on the negative impact of a company's operations on ESG factors\n\nWe implement these approaches across asset classes, including green bonds, infrastructure, real estate and private equity.\n\nWe conduct sustainability risk assessments to avoid investing, or invest less, in high-risk companies and to prioritise investments in companies with low sustainability risk 18) .  Storebrand measures material ESG risk, or the risk of causing a negative impact on sustainability factors, through our ESG Risk Rating. A company's ESG risk is measured by:\n\n- 1. Corporate governance: Basic principles of good corporate governance apply to all companies regardless of industry. Poor corporate governance constitutes a material /financial risk.\n- 2. Material ESG issues: Key ESG factors considered at the industry level. Issues are examined based on industry, business model and the business environment in which a company operates.\n- 3. Individual ESG issues: ESG-related challenges for individual companies that are not related to a speci/fic industry or business model.\n\nThe asset management's risk and ownership team assess risk mitigation measures.\n\nRisk is inherent in many industries. Therefore, we not only assess risks, but also companies' ability to manage them. All companies in our investment universe receive an ESG risk score. The score forms part of the decision basis for our portfolio managers when making investment decisions.\n\nOur risk and ownership team also uses the sustainability score when identifying and prioritising thematic adverse impacts for speci/fic industries, when identifying needs for improvement in individual companies, and when deciding how to vote at portfolio company shareholder meetings.\n\nWe identify, manage and reduce adverse climate, environmental and social impacts in our investments by, among other things, following the OECD Guidelines on Responsible Business Conduct for Institutional Investors, the OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Business Conduct and the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises, as well as the UN Guiding Principles for Business and Human Rights.\n\nWe have identi/fied the following main categories of negative impact on people and nature that apply to all equity and debt portfolios:\n\n- \u00b7  Adverse impacts a/ffecting the environment and climate, including severe environmental damage, greenhouse gas emissions, loss of biodiversity or deforestation.\n- \u00b7  Adverse impacts on workers, communities and society, such as violations of fundamental labour rights, forced labour, gender/diversity discrimination or violations of indigenous peoples' rights.",

Solutions-driven investment: We invest more capital in solution companies, green bonds, certi/fied green real estate and green infrastructure.\n- 2. Active ownership: We in/fluence the companies we invest in, alone or jointly with others, through activities such as voting and dialogue.\n- 3. Exclusion: We exclude investments that are not in line with our sustainability principles. This includes companies that violate international norms and conventions, or are involved in unacceptable operations.\n\n## Solution-driven investment\n\nWe strive to achieve a positive impact in society by directing more capital to companies that are well positioned to solve global sustainability challenges. We do this by increasing investments in solution companies, green bonds and real estate and infrastructure that support the SDGs.\n\nWe aim to invest 15 per cent of assets under management in solution companies, bond investments in solutions, green bonds, green infrastructure and environmentally certi/fied real estate by 2025. At the end of 2023, 12.9 per cent of our total assets were invested in solutions, up from 12.4 per cent in 2022. 9.6 per cent of our equity investments are invested in solution companies, 11.4 per cent of bond investments are invested in solutions and green bonds, 100 per cent of infrastructure investments are invested in green infrastructure and 61.9 per cent of real estate investments in certi/fied green real estate.\n\nThe following principles guide our investment and stewardship approach:\n\n- 1. Make investment decisions in line with scienti/fic consensus\n- 2. Reorient capital /flows towards low-carbon, climate-resilient and transition companies\n- 3. Avoid investments that contribute signi/ficantly to climate change\n- 4. Use ownership positions to stimulate ambitious ESG practices at portfolio companies\n- 5. Make it simple for clients to understand how they may contribute to a low-carbon future\n\n## How Storebrand contributes to the UN SDGs through investments in solutions\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe promote companies that contribute to good health and quality of life.

Shareholder matters\n- 4. Annual Accounts and Notes\n- 5. Ap/fiendix\n\n## Equity investments in solutions\n\nThrough proprietary analyses, we identify solution companies. These are companies that help achieve the SDGs through products, services and operations, without causing signi/ficant harm to society or the environment.\n\nThe companies are included in a database that is updated regularly. The database is a valuable tool for fund managers and serves as the basis for our thematic solution portfolios (for example, on renewable energy, smart cities and equal opportunities), or as part of broader investment portfolios.\n\n## Solution investments in other asset classes\n\n## Debt\n\nWithin /fixed income and credit management, we invest in debt instruments with di/fferent credit quality and maturities. This includes green and sustainability-linked bonds that provide direct exposure to sustainable initiatives. Companies included in the green bonds we invest in must comply with international standards such as the Green Bond Principles, the forthcoming EU Green Bond standard and the International Capital Market Association (ICMA) framework. By the end of 2023, we had invested NOK 40.7 billion in green bonds. This represents 9.8 per cent of our total bond investments, up from 8.3 per cent in 2022.\n\nStorebrand also makes bond investments in the category 'Solutions' 19) . Our ambition is to increase our holdings in the category.\n\n## Real Estate\n\nStorebrand's real estate business primarily comprises management of existing property on behalf of investors, as well as construction projects to adapt, rehabilitate and further develop the properties.\n\nWe are working towards a portfolio that is robust to physical climate risk and other risks. The building and construction sector accounts for 40 per cent of greenhouse gas emissions, energy use and waste production. Storebrand works continuously to reduce the climate and environmental footprint of its real estate operations. Emissions from our real estate investments in Norway and Sweden were 5.6 kg CO2 equivalents per m2, marginally up from 5.5 kg in 2022, but over 40 per cent down against the reference year 2018. A 20 per cent reduction in energy consumption has contributed to this.\n\n80 per cent of the building stock that will exist in 2050 has already been built. Upgrading buildings therefore makes an important contribution to energy and emission cuts, while reducing sustainability risk. It also reduces impacts on nature and natural resources, which are under signi/ficant pressure. We preserve and transform and seek circular solutions with the least possible waste generation and use of new materials. With increased reuse, we can avoid greenhouse gas emissions and take scarce material resources out of the cycle. We seek a positive impact on the local environment by promoting safe and attractive neighbourhoods, increasing urban nature and biodiversity, and preventing pollution to air, soil and water.\n\n## 900 tons of materials reused\n\nWhen renovating the o/ffice building Grev Wedels Plass 9 in Oslo, Norway, real energy consumption has been reduced by as much as 60 per cent, while the property's energy labelling has been raised from 'D' to 'B'.  We achieved this improvement through measures such as:\n\n- \u00b7 Upgrading of ventilation systems and high heat recovery\n- \u00b7 Smart control of lighting, heating, ventilation and shading\n- \u00b7 Sealing of air leaks\n- \u00b7 Solar cells on roofs and integrated in glass roofs\n- \u00b7 Powerless sockets cut standby consumption at night\n- \u00b7 Heat pump for extra recovery of heat from refrigeration systems and ventilation\n\nBy preserving and transforming, we have saved 90 per cent of greenhouse gas emissions compared to building new.\n\nCircularity is important in all our projects. The project at Grev Wedels Plass 9 achieved:\n\n- \u00b7 82 per cent of waste is reused or recovered (without energy recovery), exceeding the EU taxonomy's requirement of 70 per cent.\n- \u00b7 Almost 95 per cent sorting rate (including energy recovery), far exceeding the requirement in the building regulations of 70 per cent, and the industry average of 75 per cent.\n- \u00b7 The average amount of waste was less than 40 kg per square metre, including demolition of parts of the building. This is far below the industry average of 132 kg per square metre from the latest statistics.",

Shareholder matters\n- 4. Annual Accounts and Notes\n- 5. Ap/fiendix\n\nWe aim to increase the proportion of green investments according to the EU taxonomy and certify the properties according to the BREEAM environmental classi/fication system or equivalent. In 2023 the proportion of real estate investments with an environmental certi/ficate (BREEAM or equivalent) was 62 per cent. Despite an increase in the number of certi/fied properties, that's down from 65 per cent in 2022. This is due to the availability of new and uncerti/fied property stock for management.\n\nIn 2023, all portfolios maintained /five out of /five possible stars in GRESB, the Global Sustainability Benchmark for Real Assets. Storebrand Eiendomsfond Norway KS and SPP Fastigheter AS were both named 'Global Sector Leader' in the category 'Diversi/fied ' 20) . The results re/flect our e/fforts to, among other things, reduce energy consumption and CO2 emissions, as well as reduce waste and water consumption.\n\n## Infrastructure\n\nSince the launch of the Storebrand Infrastructure Fund in 2021, the fund has made seven direct investments in projects that enable the transition to a greener economy.\n\nReducing global emissions will require large investments into renewable energy generation, grid infrastructure, storage capacities and other infrastructure. The investment required to achieve net zero is USD 28 trillion, of which 50 per cent would be directly relevant for infrastructure investors.\n\nWe invest in infrastructure located in Europe and North America. The European Commission's InvestEU and REPowerEU programmes aim to mobilise over EUR 650 billion of public and private investments by 2027 to ensure the transition to a low carbon economy. The United States In/flation Reduction Act (IRA) aims to allocate more than USD 370 billion in funding to mitigate climate change. These regulations are positive for Storebrand's infrastructure fund. The European energy crisis in 2022 further underlined the importance of the fund's mandate. The European energy crisis in 2022 further highlighted the importance of the fund's mandate.\n\nThe current portfolio includes an investment in the City of Oslo's district heating network, an onshore wind farm in the United States, an o/ffshore wind farm outside Scotland and two investments in electric train /fleets in the United Kingdom. The fund has also invested into two assets under construction: an o/ffshore wind farm in the German North Sea and an investment in two co-located solar energy plants with battery storage facilities in the United States.\n\n## Private equity & private credit\n\nStorebrand's private equity investments are carried out through its wholly owned subsidiary and fund-of-funds manager, Cubera Private Equity ('Cubera').\n\nAlthough we have limited formal in/fluence on ESG issues during the ownership phase of private equity assets, we exercise an in/fluence on these issues through manager\n\nselection and dialogue. We work with fund managers who share our view that investing in companies that work well with sustainability provide good risk management and good risk-adjusted future returns.\n\nPrivate equity managers often have direct in/fluence over longer ownership periods and are thus well positioned to in/fluence ESG results. More impact funds are being established in the market, where managers actively invest to solve societal challenges. This gives Cubera an increasing selection of potential funds to invest in.\n\nThere are few reliable and standardised ESG metrics available in the private equity industry. Cubera therefore places great importance on working with fund managers (GPs) to produce relevant ESG information. Cubera published its /first impact report in 2023, based on data collected from all funds and managers. Cubera will continue to collaborate with the private equity community, supporting industry initiatives, and actively involving investors to integrate sustainability into mandates and standardise data.\n\n## Active ownership\n\nExercising our in/fluence through active ownership is very important. We set expectations for the companies we invest in and use our ownership position to in/fluence the companies for improvement. To reduce negative impact, we have a transparent process to ensure that companies meet our sustainability risk standards.\n\nThe asset management's risk and ownership team assess which companies we should engage with or whether we should express our opinions through voting.\n\nIn 2023, the Board of Directors of Storebrand Group adopted updated polices for sustainable investments to re/flect current practice and changes in internal governance. The policy is overarching, with the following underlying policies that were adjusted in 2023:\n\n- 1. Exclusion Policy\n- 2. Human Rights Policy\n- 3. Engagement and Voting Policy\n- 4. Deforestation Policy\n\nWe also have a nature policy and a climate policy that were not updated in 2023. 21)\n\n## Engagement\n\nFive principles guide Storebrand's exercise of ownership rights:\n\n- 1. Creating shareholder value: Our engagement activities should contribute to long-term value creation in a responsible manner.\n- 2. Positive impact: Our activities should aim to create actual positive change, not symbolic value.\n- 3. Nordic approach: We prioritise opportunities where we are particularly well-positioned to have a positive impact, but do not limit ourselves to the Nordic region.",

Shareholder matters\n- 4. Annual Accounts and Notes\n- 5. Ap/fiendix\n- 4. Stakeholder collaboration: We work with a wide range of stakeholders, including governments, civil society, business and investors, to solve complex challenges and in/fluence large companies.\n- 5. Targeted engagement: We focus on companies where we have a signi/ficant ownership stake.\n\n## Engagement themes\n\nDuring the period 2021-2023, we have prioritised the following themes:\n\nThe transition to a low-emission society and net zero emissions in 2050: Storebrand is committed to achieving net zero greenhouse gas emissions in our investment portfolios by 2050, in line with the Paris Agreement.\n\nIn line with this commitment, we have set short-term targets to reduce emissions 22) from Storebrand's total listed equity, corporate bond and real estate investments by 32 per cent by 2025, with 2018 as the base year. Furthermore, Storebrand has a target for 42 per cent of listed equities and corporate bonds to have set validated science-based targets by 2027 (based on AUM).  This target has been approved and validated by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi). Our progression on these goals is shown on page 109.\n\nTo achieve our goals, we collaborate with other investors through platforms such as Climate Action 100+ and the Net Zero Engagement Initiative (NZEI), where we play a leading role. In addition, we engage with companies in our highest-emission portfolios and set clear expectations for them to set targets, have credible decarbonisation strategies and report in a transparent and standardised manner.\n\nWe participate in the Just Transition Collective Impact Coalition, which has partnered with the World Benchmarking Association's Equitable Transition Initiative. In 2023, the initiative sent a joint statement to ten energy companies expecting the companies to plan for a just transition to a low-emission society. Storebrand led the dialogue on behalf of the investor group towards Norwegian-owned Equinor.\n\nIn 2023, we voted on 114 explicitly climate-related proposals, of which 78 were votes against company management's proposals.\n\nBiodiversity and ecosystems: The protection and sustainable management of nature are essential to ensure long-term social and economic stability. Nature underpins all economic activities. Businesses are directly dependent on nature and the services it provides, including water, materials and /flood protection. The Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF) of the Kunming-Montreal agreement adopted in December 2022, recognises for the /first time the role /finance can play in helping to halt the loss of nature. This is the result of work carried out by Finance for Biodiversity, a coalition of 153 global /financial institutions, of which Storebrand is co-chair. Storebrand represented the /financial industry during the negotiations in Montreal and will continue to lead Finance for Biodiversity's work towards the authorities also in 2024.\n\nIn 2022, Nature Action 100 was launched, the /first global nature initiative for investors, with the goal of halting and reversing the loss of nature and biodiversity. In a short period of time, the coalition, in which Storebrand participates, has gathered nearly 200 /financial institutions around the demands placed on 100 global companies that are considered critical to halting the loss of nature.\n\nStorebrand is a driving force for investor measures against deforestation and for reducing the /financial risk associated with deforestation. As co-chair of the Investor Policy Dialogue on Deforestation (IPDD), we engage with policy makers in Brazil, Indonesia, the US and the EU on this. Through the Finance Sector Deforestation Action (FSDA), we contribute to engagement with 80 companies, with the aim of eliminating deforestation risk from their operations, supply chains and loan books.\n\nIn 2023, we also worked to prevent the commercialisation of deep-sea mining, in line with the precautionary principle of our nature policy.\n\nIn January 2023, Storebrand, together with a group of the world's largest institutional investors and their representatives, launched the Investor Initiative on Hazardous Chemicals (IIHC), a collaborative engagement with major chemical companies regarding management of hazardous chemicals and transparency. The IIHC is comprised of 50 institutional investors with over USD 10 trillion of assets under management. The initiative addresses the global health and environmental crises associated with the use of harmful substances and calls for an end to the production of 'forever chemicals'. Such chemicals can pose a systemic threat to nature and biodiversity.\n\nIn 2023, we voted on 12 nature-related proposals (excluding climate-related proposals), of which 10 were votes against company management's proposals. Eight of the proposals were related to plastic pollution.\n\nResilient supply chains: Respect for labour rights in supply chains has been an important issue for Storebrand for many years. Our goal is to ensure healthy operations through robust supply chains.\n\nIn 2023, we mapped and assessed human rights risks in sectors ranging from renewable energy to oil and gas, textile, food and agriculture. We have implemented measures to stop, prevent, or limit negative consequences in our portfolios for the following risks:\n\n- \u00b7  Living wages and decent working conditions in supply chains\n- \u00b7  Forced labour\n- \u00b7   Gender, diversity, and inclusion\n- \u00b7   Employee rights, including the right to participate in trade unions\n- \u00b7   Children's  rights\n- \u00b7   Local community rights in the green transition\n- \u00b7  Indigenous peoples' rights\n- \u00b7  Human rights in high-risk countries and con/flict areas",

Ap/fiendix\n\nIn 2023, we continued our partnership with the Platform for Living Wages Financials (PLWF), to help conduct assessments and in/fluence portfolio companies to pay a living wage for workers within the food, textile and other retail sectors. Storebrand co-led two of the PLWF workstreams, actively participating in the writing of the PLWF annual report and presenting results at the PLWF annual conference.\n\nWe also reported in accordance with the EU's Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR) on principal adverse impacts such as violations of the UN Global Compact and OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises, unadjusted gender pay gap, board gender diversity, and exposure to controversial weapons.\n\nIn 2023, we voted on 130 proposals related to resilient supply chains, of which 111 were votes against company management's proposals.\n\nCorporate sustainability disclosure: Storebrand advocates standardised and company-speci/fic sustainability standards to ensure transparency and benchmarking. The reporting of ESG-speci/fic issues is a good indication of how a company measures and manages its exposure to risk.\n\nA milestone in this regard was achieved in September 2023, with the launch of the /final version of the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD) framework. Storebrand has been part of an Informal Working Group (IWG) preparing for the launch of the TNFD, and we are active in the TNFD Forum.\n\nStorebrand Asset Management was also part of a group of 93 investors that issued a joint statement to the European Commission in July 2023, cautioning European Parliamentarians against watering down the proposed requirements included in the upcoming European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS).",

In total, we registered 572 interactions with portfolio companies. 294 of these activities were linked to an ongoing engagement with a company. These activities included enquiries to obtain information, as well as dialogue and follow-up of the companies' sustainability e/fforts.\n\nWe had 57 dialogues with 40 external fund managers and /five meetings with government representatives.\n\n80 per cent of our engagements with portfolio companies were conducted in collaborations and alliances with other stakeholders, up from 77 per cent in 2022. This re/flects our strategy to join forces with other investors and stakeholders to maximise impact, where appropriate.\n\nDuring the year, we concluded 222 engagements, with positive outcomes in 20 of those cases, i.e. we achieved the goal of the dialogue.\n\n## Format of engagements\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n19 %\n\n- One-on-one\n\n11 %\n\n- Collaborative (leading role)\n\n69 %\n\n- Collaborative (supporting role)\n\n## Dialogue with companies\n\nOne-on-one dialogues between Storebrand and companies accounted for 19 per cent of our dialogues with portfolio companies. In other cases, we engaged in dialogue with companies in collaboration with other investors. Of these, 11 per cent were conducted with Storebrand in a leading role, and 69 per cent with Storebrand in a supporting role. A total of 94 per cent of the dialogues took place at the initiative of Storebrand or other investors, compared to 93 per cent in 2022, while 6 per cent occurred on a reactive basis, meaning they were triggered by speci/fic incidents and controversies that resulted in requests to companies for measures to remedy damages and avoid recurrence.\n\nThe dialogues took place mainly in the form of e-mails, letters and digital meetings. In most cases, the dialogue took place with investor contacts or representatives of the companies' sustainability teams. In 5 per cent of cases, we were in contact with the CEO of the companies.\n\n## Sector engagement\n\nMost of the engagements in 2023 were aimed at companies in materials, industrials and consumer staples sectors.\n\n## Engagement by sector\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Geography\n\nThe majority of the companies we had dialogue with in 2023 were based in the US, Norway, Sweden and Japan.\n\n## ESG categories of engagement\n\nIn 2023, we engaged with portfolio companies on several ESG topics. 51 per cent of the dialogues addressed environmental issues, including climate change, emissions, deforestation and the use of chemicals, while 33 per cent focused on social issues such as human rights, working conditions and wage conditions. 16 per cent of the dialogues focused on corporate governance.",

Storebrand has been actively involved in advocacy work towards a wide range of stakeholders.\n\nIn 2020, Storebrand established and led the Investors Policy Dialogue on Deforestation (IPDD) (described above). At the end of 2023, IPDD was backed by 78 global institutional investors from 20 countries representing approximately USD 10 trillion in assets under management.\n\nIPDD members recognise that deforestation is a complex issue that requires long-term dialogue and in/fluence at policy level and with di/fferent stakeholders. Since its launch, the members have held numerous meetings with key stakeholders at executive, legislative and regional levels.\n\nIn 2022, Storebrand, together with a group of institutional investors, announced the establishment of Nature Action 100, which is described above.",

The group understands that Nippon Steel intends only to temporarily prolong the life of the blast furnaces that use conventional technology, where economic, maintenance or safety matters stand in the way of immediate conversion.\n\n68\n\nNippon Steel has stated that a stable supply of renewable energy such as green hydrogen and power are prerequisites for achieving the goal of carbon neutrality.\n\nDevelopments so far in this case show how shareholder dialogue and investor alliances can stimulate positive change. Nippon Steel still relies on unproven technologies, which creates uncertainties related to e/fficiency and cost. The company also has not demonstrated su/fficient transparency regarding capital allocation, particularly details on investments in decarbonisation technologies.\n\nStorebrand will continue to follow up Nippon Steel in 2024.",

Ap/fiendix\n\n## How Storebrand contributes to the UN SDGs through active ownership\n\nWe expect companies to take a structured approach to promoting gender diversity and diversity in general, as well as equity and inclusion, across their workforce and supply chains. The company should conduct a due diligence assessment for measures to improve the gender balance in its own operations, supply chains, products and services, and for the company's impact on local communities and society. They should have zero tolerance for all forms of discrimination, violence and harassment, and have training programmes and reporting mechanisms, as well as clear policies for their work.\n\nStorebrand has engaged with companies on these issues, as well as voting and supporting shareholder resolutions at general meetings aiming to:\n\n- 1. Improve transparency about processes that reduce gender inequality, including policies and objectives.\n- 2. Achieve diversity in boards and/or senior management.\n- 3. Achieve better transparency about gender pay gaps and measures to achieve this.\n- 4. Conduct due diligence related to gender and diversity.\n\nWe generally vote against, or withhold our votes from, the incumbent members of the nominating committee of boards, if they do not contain at least 40 per cent of people from underrepresented genders.\n\nAn important topic in our dialogue with the companies we invest in is requirements for good social conditions in the supply chain, including the issue of forced labour. We continue to focus on China and the Xinjiang region through direct company dialogue and cooperation with the Investor Alliance on Human Rights. Storebrand works to raise awareness of international labour rights, especially in vulnerable industries such as the textile industry.\n\nWe engage in dialogue with companies in our portfolio on working conditions, particularly the living wage. We are part of the PLWF (Platform for Living Wages Financials) initiative, where we lead and collaborate with other investors and civil society on issues of living wages and structures that support good working conditions.  The platform contributes to positive developments in living wages in the clothing, food and agriculture sectors, as well as the retail industry.\n\nWe work with companies to reduce water consumption and greenhouse gas emissions in livestock production. In partnership with Platform Living Wages Financials, we also engage with companies on working conditions. We have engaged in dialogue with companies about the rights of local communities and indigenous peoples, and about responsible production that does not adversely a/ffect local communities.\n\nThe transition to a low-emission society and net zero emissions in 2050 is a top priority. We encourage companies to adopt climate strategies aligned with the Paris Agreement, targeting net zero emissions by 2050 or sooner. We pay special attention to the largest emitters among our portfolio companies. We engage with several banks to understand their exposure to the fossil fuel industry. Our participation in the Climate Action 100+, The Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change (IIGCC), as well as the Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI), provides platforms for collaborative engagement. We expect investee companies to:\n\n- 1. Implement a strong governance framework that clearly articulates the board's accountability and oversight of climate change risk.\n- 2. Implement measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions throughout the value chain, in line with the Paris Agreement.\n- 3. Provide enhanced corporate disclosure in line with the /final recommendations of the Task Force on Climate related Financial Disclosures (TCFD).\n- 4. Supports policy measures to reduce the risk of climate change and limit the temperature rise to 1.5 degrees. Storebrand will not invest in companies that deliberately and systematically lobby against the goals of the Paris Agreement.\n- 5. Support just transition: Including labour law and social issues in climate-related activity. Renewable energy and mining companies must conduct human rights due diligence to identify the impact of their operations on workers, communities, indigenous peoples, and environmental and human rights.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Ap/fiendix\n\n## How Storebrand contributes to the UN SDGs through active ownership (cont.)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn line with our nature policy, we do not invest in companies that engage in deep-sea mining activities, or in marine or riverine tailings disposal. Due to the scienti/fic uncertainty and the potential negative consequences for vulnerable ecosystems, we have applied the precautionary principle. We engage in active dialogue with companies, industry associations and policy makers to explain our view on the environmental and /financial risks that deep sea mining and tailings disposal entail.\n\nStorebrand's nature policy expresses clear expectations of companies. We use frameworks from International Financial Corporation's (IFC) Performance Standard 6, the Science-Based Targets Network (SBTN) and the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD).\n\nWe expect companies to have policies in place to manage nature-related /financial risks and opportunities in their investments and /financial operations. At a minimum, we expect companies to report on a four-pillar approach: 1. Governance, 2. Strategy, 3. Risk Management, and 4. Metrics and Targets. We expect companies to incorporate the principle of 'double materiality', disclosing not only how nature impacts the organisation, but also how the organisation impacts nature.\n\nWe are committed to eliminating commodity-driven deforestation from our portfolios by 2025. Tropical forests contain between 50 and 80 per cent of land-based species, and provide critical ecosystem services. Our expectations of companies associated with deforestation risk are described in our deforestation policy, which was updated in 2023. The main elements of our strategy are portfolio screening and disclosure of deforestation risk, engagement with companies and policy makers and reducing risk exposure (divestment/exclusion).\n\nWe take measures to avoid corruption and bribery at portfolio companies enabled by inadequate corporate governance. We highlight the importance of consistent, reliable, and veri/fiable reporting on such factors by companies. We engage with companies operating in war and con/flict areas, demanding that they respect human rights and avoid contributing to con/flict via their operations, for example in occupied territories in Palestine. Ultimately, we exclude companies that do not meet our requirements.\n\n## Voting\n\nIn 2023, we voted at 1,999 company meetings, an increase from 1,348 in 2022. We voted at meetings held in a total of 60 countries. We voted most frequently in the US; at 523 meetings. The sector with the most meetings was the industrial sector with 849 meetings, while companies in the energy sector had the fewest, with 137 meetings.\n\nWe have prioritised voting where we consider it to have the best possible e/ffect and prioritise general meetings in companies that represent:\n\n- 1. Our largest holdings\n- 2. The Norwegian and Swedish markets\n- 3. Our most important ownership dialogue initiatives\n- 4. Speci/fic ESG-related resolutions\n\nThe AGMs we voted at correspond to 90 per cent of our total equity investments, up from 68 per cent in 2022.\n\nAmong 52,304 voting motions in 2023, we voted on 27,399 items, or 52.4 per cent. This is an increase from 2022, when we voted in over 17,600 out of 51,980 voting proposals, equivalent to 34 per cent. This aligns with our strategy to proactively exercise our voting rights, including targeted escalation when needed.\n\nStorebrand has also proposed resolutions at several general meetings. This is particularly done in cases of deadlocked dialogue or where companies ignore proposals, in matters of major importance to several shareholders, or in collaboration with other shareholders for leverage. In 2023, we co-/filed resolutions to be voted on at the general meetings of Toyota and Amazon, among others.\n\nIn recent years, international investors are increasingly utilising /filing resolutions as an escalation tool.",

In 2023, a number of 'anti-ESG' shareholder proposals were put forward at general meetings in the US. These proposals are intended to prevent companies from spending resources on dealing with ESG issues such as climate change or workplace diversity.\n\nNinety per cent of our voting in 2023 was in line with company management, while we voted against management's recommendations in 10 per cent of cases. Among other things, we voted against the re-election of board members in companies with poor corporate governance, or where the Board had failed to follow up companies' obligations related to ESG-related reporting and targets. It is generally very di/fficult to achieve a majority against management's recommendation, and in 2023 we achieved this in only 78 cases. However, voting against management's recommendation can still lead to change over time, as it gives a clear signal of what direction shareholders want. This can contribute to positive changes in the governance of companies.\n\nExamples of voting in 2023:\n\n- \u00b7 We supported shareholder resolutions asking Danish companies A.P. Moeller-Maersk and Carlsberg to report on due diligence and human rights risks in their operations and supply chains.\n- \u00b7 We voted in favour of a shareholder proposal asking Starbucks Corporation to conduct an independent assessment on the company's e/fforts to respect freedom of association and collective bargaining rights.\n- \u00b7 At the annual general meeting of Canadian company Metro Inc, we supported a shareholder proposal asking the company to report on human rights risks associated with the use of migrant workers. At the same AGM, we also voted in favour of a resolution to adopt sciencebased emission reduction targets.\n- \u00b7 At the annual general meeting of Nike Inc., we supported two proposals, regarding gender pay gaps and the implementation of human rights commitments in the company's supply chain.\n- \u00b7 We supported a shareholder proposal at Microchip Technology Inc. to report on due diligence assessments that track misuse by end users of the company's products.\n- \u00b7 In addition, we voted for FedEx Corporation to adopt a paid sick leave policy.\n- \u00b7 We voted in favour of a shareholder proposal asking Apple Inc. to report on its pay gaps related to gender and ethnic diversity.\n- \u00b7 We voted in favour of shareholder proposals asking companies to comply with World Health Organisation (WHO) guidelines for antimicrobial use in supply chains.\n\nISS is our proxy voting service provider, and we usually vote in alignment with their recommendations based on the ISS Sustainability Voting Guidelines. We change voting instructions when appropriate. For example, at the Amazon.com AGM, we supported a shareholder proposal on animal welfare, against the recommendation of ISS. We believe the proposal to produce an audit and report on animal welfare in Amazon.com supply chain will reduce the company's risk and be bene/ficial to shareholders. Another example of our voting against ISS recommendations was our vote against TotalEnergies SA's 'Sustainable Development and Energy Transition Plan'. The reason was that, in our opinion, the plan was not su/fficiently robust to comply with the Paris Agreement's 1.5\u00b0C target.\n\nAll our votes are published online at ISS Governance Proxy Voting Dashboard",

One example was the resolution on climate lobbying disclosure at the 2023 annual general meeting of Toyota Motor Corporation (Toyota). Toyota has demonstrated leadership on climate change in several important areas. Despite increased transparency, the company continues to lobby against climate-related regulation and policies in several countries, according to independent think tank In/fluenceMap.\n\nOur shareholder proposals with other investors were backed by proxy advisors, and many US and European\n\n72\n\nasset managers and owners. Although the proposal unfortunately did not pass at the meeting, which due to Japanese rules required the support of two thirds of the shareholders, the issue received the attention of Toyota's Board of Directors and management, and sent a clear signal that a signi/ficant proportion of investors expect more openness and transparency.\n\nWe await an updated report from Toyota in 2024 on their e/fforts to improve reporting on lobbying activities. Depending on the results, we will consider options to further escalate the dialogue.",

For selected funds and savings pro/files, we apply expanded criteria related to businesses involved in the production and distribution of fossil fuels, alcohol, pornography, weapons, and gambling, as well as green bond standards.\n\nWe address serious breaches of our policy by our portfolio companies through a structured and policy-driven process, where exclusion is generally the last resort if we are unable to in/fluence the company to change its practices.\n\nIn cases of serious conduct-based violations (e.g. human rights) or activity-based violations (e.g. lobbying against the Paris Agreement) that are in breach of our policy, we usually begin by engaging with the company. If we conclude that the company poses an unacceptable risk of breaching our policy, we sell our holdings in the company and exclude it from our investment portfolio.\n\nIn the case of product-based breaches (such as production and distribution related to coal and oil sands), our exclusion process is based primarily on data analysis. We have agreements with third-party databases that\n\ndocument and report the percentage of revenue that companies receive from certain product classi/fications. If a company's revenue from the excluded product classes exceeds our threshold level, we automatically exclude the company. The detailed product-based threshold levels vary, rising to a maximum of /five per cent of total revenue.\n\nIn 2023, we made adjustments and improvements to our screening process, partly to better cover issuers that primarily issue bonds. This has resulted in a one-o/ff increase in the number of exclusions, from a signi/ficantly larger universe of companies and funds than before. This adjustment accounts for roughly 80 per cent of the exclusions. The remainder are part of our regular productbased screening, which we conduct quarterly.\n\nAs of 31 December 2023, the screening process resulted in 113 companies being excluded from our investment portfolios based on conduct- or activity-based criteria. A total of 288 additional companies 23) were excluded based on our product-based criteria and NBIM/Oil Fund exclusions 24) .\n\nSome examples of exclusions in 2023:\n\n- \u00b7  POWERCHINA, based on risk of serious harm to the environment.\n- \u00b7  GAIL India Ltd, Korea Gas Corporation and Sinopec, all based on risk of human rights violations in Myanmar.\n- \u00b7  Hanwha Aerospace Ltd, based on issues related to production of fuses for white phosphorus ammunition.\n- \u00b7  Israel-based Surveillance software company Cognyte, based on risk of human rights violations in Occupied Palestinian Territories.\n\nAs of 31 December 2023, 248 companies listed on the MSCI ACWI Index were listed as excluded from all our funds. An additional 309 companies on the same index were excluded from certain funds, solely based on our extended criteria.",

Ap/fiendix\n\n## Occupied Palestinian Territories\n\nSince 2009, Storebrand has screened and assessed companies related to the occupation of Palestinian territories. We have strengthened our human rights due diligence assessment in this area and have engaged in dialogue with and divested from several companies on this basis.\n\nOur human rights due diligence includes an annual analysis based on data from data providers and our own analysis to identify human rights risks on this topic in our portfolios. Once the risk has been identi/fied, we address and mitigate the risk by engaging with and ultimately excluding companies.\n\nAll activities, services and goods have the potential to contribute to the occupation and to maintaining the illegal settlements. However, some of these contribute more than others. We focus on those who are at higher risk of this and engage in dialogue with these companies. We exclude\n\n74\n\ncompanies where it is not possible to exert in/fluence. Since 2009, we have used a set of criteria to assess the extent to which companies contribute to the occupation. The criteria include companies that:\n\n- \u00b7  Makes surveillance and identi/fication equipment available at checkpoints and thus enables the maintenance of the occupation regime.\n- \u00b7  Contributes to the construction, maintenance and expansion of settlements and the exploitation of natural resources, including infrastructure and direct /financing.\n- \u00b7  Purchases goods or services from companies operating in Israeli-occupied territories.\n- \u00b7  Companies that fall into the /first and second categories are candidates for company dialogue and potential exclusion if the dialogue is not successful.\n\nAs of 31 December 2023, we excluded 24 companies related to the occupation of Palestinian territories.",

Ap/fiendix\n\n## Sustainability in insurance\n\n## Why sustainability in insurance\n\nClimate change, destruction of nature and overconsumption are major challenges. As a non-life insurance provider, we have a responsibility to contribute to a positive change. We can reduce climate risk, be a catalyst for the circular economy and encourage loss prevention. Climate change will lead to increasing number and severity of natural events, such as /floods, extreme rainfall, landslides and storm surges. Water ingress in buildings is the damage that leads to the highest payouts in the insurance industry and constitutes a /financial risk to us.\n\nAs an insurance provider, we are a driving force for the circular economy. Claims settlements after damage a/ffect material /flows and we may choose more circular solutions. Reduced material uses and circular material /flows are often more energy e/fficient, and measures to solve the challenge of material scarcity therefore also result in lower emissions. We believe that the transition to a circular economy will provide business opportunities that we are well positioned to bene/fit from.\n\nLoss prevention is an important part of our responsibility as an insurance provider. Damages are a waste of resources and requires new materials and energy to repair, resulting in waste. E/ffective prevention measures are pro/fitable both from a socio-economic perspective, for Storebrand and for the customer, who are in a di/fficult situation. We may achieve great gains both /financially and environmentally through loss prevention, while also making our products more competitive.\n\nAs a provider of pension and disability insurance, we may have a major impact on people's lives. We contribute to /financial security and wellness through the payment of disability and life insurance. Our business provides us with a wealth of knowledge and enables us to contribute to e/fforts to prevent and reduce disability and exclusion.\n\nIn recent years, there has been a steady increase in the proportion of people of working age in Norway who receive disability bene/fits. The negative development is particularly evident among young people, where the proportion of people with disability bene/fits in the 25-29 age group has more than doubled in the last 10 years. A very low proportion of those receiving disability bene/fits return to working life. This is a big cost for society, the people concerned, employers, the industry and Storebrand.\n\nStorebrand wants to contribute to reducing the extent of disability in Norway. We seek solutions through preventive measures and targeted early e/fforts together with the public sector, to help both young and disabled adults return to work.\n\n## Our strategy\n\nWe shall ensure that our products and services are developed in a responsible manner and shall be at the forefront of market developments. In its role as a responsible corporate citizen, Storebrand will participate actively in the social debate and, through the industry and other partners, be a driving force for a sustainable transition.\n\nAs an insurance company, we make a living from understanding and managing risk. It is necessary that we develop our insight and ability to handle new types of risks. This is particularly relevant for damage resulting from climate change, but it also necessary to understand the risks involved in the introduction of new and more environmentally friendly technology, for example /fire risk from solar cell systems.\n\nOur strategy in the insurance segment is fourfold:\n\n- 1. To promote a circular economy through the product and service o/fferings and communicate this actively.\n- 2. Through loss prevention, repairs and reuse, we shall contribute to a purchasing pattern that increases the demand for circular services, as well as focus on circular claims settlements.\n- 3. Climate adaptation through the requirements of the EU taxonomy is a priority, and we will implement climate adaptation measures in line with good loss preventive insurance business and enable ourselves to understand and manage climate risks.\n- 4. We shall, in cooperation with the public sector, contribute to reducing the level of disability in Norway by launching preventive measures and targeted e/fforts, aiming to help disabled young and adult people return to work.\n\n## Our approach\n\n## Climate risk and adaptation\n\nStorebrand aims for 80 per cent of the eligible non-life insurance premium volume to be in accordance with the criteria in the EU taxonomy by the end of 2024. In 2023, property products (houses, cabins, commercial buildings, residential buildings, household contents) became aligned. This includes the integration of forward-looking climate risk in the risk assessment through Geodata, updated conditions for providing risk rewards for climate adaptation measures for the customer, sharing damagerelated data through 'Kunnskapsbanken' so that it can be used by public authorities and more. Over time, this will contribute to better handling of the e/ffects of climate change. The climate risk models will be further developed based on insights. Based on the experience from the /first version of the product changes to comply with the EU",

Read more about our Taxonomy work within non-life insurance in the chapter 'EU taxonomy'.\n\nStorebrand works together with the industry to establish incentives and mechanisms that ensure loss prevention. This will provide increased insight into how, for instance, municipalities should prioritise their infrastructure initiatives. E/ffective loss prevention at societal level will result in lower consequences for everyone who is not a/ffected by natural damages. Similarly, the use of materials for reconstruction is reduced through e/ffective prevention measures.\n\n## Circularity\n\nStorebrand has high standards for our suppliers' responsible operations. Over 90 per cent of repair shops we use in our insurance business have signed the Group's supplier declaration on sustainability obligations. Speci/fic requirements have been set which are monitored and the suppliers must report, among other things, on the degree of repair, reuse of parts and use of environmentally certi/fied materials. We are collaborating with several suppliers to facilitate a circular value chain. We cooperate with suppliers within car parts to facilitate increased reuse of car parts, and Milj\u00f8 Norge and Jernia regarding distribution of recycled /fire extinguishers. The repair rate for car glass is 35.7 per cent and the proportion of used car parts (proportion of repairs where used parts are used) is 5 per cent.\n\nIn 2023, we explored material consumption and greenhouse gas emissions in claims settlements for motor vehicle, in collaboration with Variable, and gained a better understanding of where the most signi/ficant emissions are. We initiated work and methodology sharing for calculating emissions in claims settlements in Finance Norway's working group for non-life insurance and sustainability. Going forward, we will assess how this might be further developed into a common methodology for the industry.\n\nStorebrand will continue updating product terms and conditions to facilitate an increased degree of repair in insurance claims rather than buying new. We will continue working with the industry and relevant partners to facilitate circular value chains in several product areas. Read more about how we work with our suppliers in the chapter 'A responsible value chain'.\n\n## Loss prevention\n\nStorebrand has identi/fied loss prevention as the most important measure to reduce the burden on the environment in our non-life insurance business. During 2023, Storebrand recruited an employee responsible for loss prevention, as well as a /fire risk engineer, to reinforce this e/ffort. It is essential to reach the customer with insight and advice, since loss prevention often requires the customer to take action. Storebrand got involved in the public debate about the need for increased e/fforts of prevention at community level.\n\nSeveral communication and marketing activities were carried out in 2023, including:\n\n- \u00b7  O/ffer to check your luggage for bed bugs at Oslo airport during the summer holiday.\n- \u00b7  Participation in debates at Norway's largest annual political gathering (Arendalsuka) and in national news stories about climate adaptation.\n- \u00b7  Extensive water and /fire market campaigns with associated prevention advice, as well as other customer communication activities aiming at preventing damage from small rodents.\n- \u00b7  Notify potentially a/ffected customers ahead of extreme weather events, encouraging them to carry out preventive and mitigating measures.\n- \u00b7  Advice on loss prevention for business customers and housing associations.\n\nWe collaborate with external actors on loss prevention measures and communication to customers and authorities. We have entered into a partnership with a water stop supplier and held a webinar together with Huseierne (The National Federation of House Owners). Attention to loss prevention has increased among Storebrand's customers. The proportion answering yes to the question of whether they have received damage prevention advice increased from 38 per cent in 2022 to 47 per cent in 2023.\n\nStorebrand will continue focusing on loss prevention going forward.\n\n## Disability\n\nNorway has seen a large increase in the disability rate in recent years. Consequently, Storebrand pays out large sums in disability bene/fits, both to children and adults. Reducing disability levels is strategically prioritised. We introduced several pilots in 2023, aiming at contribute to solving the societal challenges of disability, while at the same time creating positive e/ffects for the people a/ffected, the companies who employs them and Storebrand as an insurer.\n\nIn the corporate market, the product VEL was launched. The concept focuses on early intervention and preventive measures to reduce absence from sick leaves. The ReStart pilot project targets people who have been on sick leave for more than 12 months, aiming at returning to work or education. A separate pilot for child insurance customers provides help for young adults who need support to enter the job market. The pilots are in initial phases and continue to evolve in 2024. The pilots will be adjusted based on gained insights.",

Ap/fiendix\n\n## \u00abTurn and win!\u00bb\n\nIn December, Storebrand carried out a marketing campaign with a spotlight on /fire extinguishers. Fire extinguishers are required in all homes, but not everyone remembers that they should be inspected and turned regularly, so that the powder does not lump and impair its function.\n\nThe device must be turned four times a year, something only 3 per cent of Norway's population does. Storebrand launched the most important competition of the year; Turn and Win. Through the campaign, we distributed a sticker with a code attached at the bottom of the /fire extinguisher.\n\n77\n\nConsequently, you had to turn the extinguisher to check whether you had won the prize of NOK 10,000. The campaign was communicated through outdoor advertising and digitally. Jernia was an important partner for distributing stickers and extinguishers.\n\nCustomers who needed a new extinguisher were o/ffered to buy discounted Storebrand reused extinguishers, made from quality-controlled appliances and /filled with new powder.",

CDP is an independent organisation that works to increase corporate reporting on climate and environment. CDP assesses and scores companies accordingly. CDP is used by investors and managers to access analyses and information on climate reporting from companies.\n- \u00b7  DJSI Score: The Dow Jones Sustainability Indices (DJSI) assess companies' sustainability performance and rank companies on a variety of economic, social and environmental criteria.\n\n## Sustainability\n\n- \u00b7  Share of total assets screened based on sustainability criteria: All companies in our investment universe are screened for sustainability according to our standards: https://www.storebrand.no/en/ sustainability/investments.\n- \u00b7  GRESB scores direct real estate investments (value-weighted average): The score is a global ESG benchmark for real estate investments, re/flecting sustainability quality in the management dimension and in the physical real estate portfolio. The total score is a value-weighted average of the score in the reporting portfolios: Storebrand Eiendom Trygg AS, Storebrand Eiendom Vekst AS, Storebrand Eiendomsfond Norway KS, and SPP Fastigheter AB. The score is calculated annually by the Global Sustainability Benchmark for Real Assets (GRESB).\n\n## Fossil-free investments\n\n- \u00b7  Investments in fossil-free products: The sum of funds/ products with a mandate that requires them to be fossilfree. The companies in the portfolio may not derive more than 5 per cent of their revenues from the production or distribution of fossil energy, or more than 25 per cent of their revenues from products and services to the oil and gas industry, and fossil reserves must not exceed 100 million tonnes of CO2.\n- \u00b7  Investments in stocks with fossil exposure: Share of investments in equities invested in fossil fuel businesses. This includes companies that derive revenues from the production or distribution of fossil fuels.  Investments in companies based on SFDR's de/finition of Principal Adverse Impact Indicator 1.4.\n- \u00b7  Investments in bonds with fossil exposure: Share of investments in bonds invested in fossil fuel businesses. This includes companies that derive revenues from the production or distribution of fossil fuels.

Sustainable solutions consist of green bonds, environmentally certi/fied real estate, investments in green infrastructure and shares in companies that we believe are well positioned to solve challenges related to the UN Sustainable Development Goals.\n- -Equity investments in solutions: Share of investments in equities in solution companies Storebrand and SPP. These are investments in shares in companies that we believe are well positioned to solve challenges related to the UN Sustainable Development Goals. Investments in solution companies are segmented into four thematic areas: renewable energy and climate solutions, the cities of the future, circular economy and equal opportunities.\n- -Bond investments in solutions, billion NOK / share of total bond investments: Share of investments in green bonds or solutions companies multiplied by the relevant company's solution weights. These are investments in bonds in companies that we believe are well positioned to solve challenges related to the UN Sustainable Development Goals. Investments in solution companies are segmented into four thematic areas: renewable energy and climate solutions, the cities of the future, circular economy and equal opportunities.\n- -Investments in green bonds: Share of investments in green bonds. Green bonds are for companies that both meet the Storebrand standard and are in line with international standards such as the Green Bond Principles, the forthcoming EU Green Bond standard, and with the International Capital Market Association (ICMA) framework.\n- -Investments in green infrastructure: Share of investments in sustainable infrastructure. The fund (Storebrand Infrastructure Fund) invests in projects that contribute to a green transition, for example through onshore wind power, o/ffshore wind and electric trainsets.\n- -Investments in certi/fied green real estate: Share of direct real estate investments under management in Norway, Sweden and Denmark with environmental certi/fication.

In previous years, companies have reported how much of their turnover, investments and operational costs are covered by the taxonomy ('taxonomy eligible'). From 2023, companies must report taxonomy-compatible activities which meet the technical criteria related to the relevant activities ('taxonomy aligned').\n\nStorebrand must disclose the degree of insurance premiums, lending and investments that are eligible by and aligned with the taxonomy. Storebrand works actively to ful/fil the requirements according to the EU taxonomy, and closely follows regulatory developments. We interact with third-party providers, and internally within the organisation to fully implement the framework. Our\n\ntaxonomy reporting will gradually serve as an important benchmark for our impact on the environment, as data quality and degree of coverage increase.\n\nThe regulations for conducting the reporting is constantly evolving, and the reporting is performed with the best possible currently available data and method at hand. Note that national speci/fic regulations to the Taxonomy Regulation may be subject to change, along with de/finitions.\n\nThe reporting is based on templates from the European Commission. Storebrand is a cross-sector /financial group, and the reporting di/ffers between the business areas. We report on our activities within investments and lending, and as a non-life insurer, we report on activity-speci/fic contributions at product level.\n\nBelow is a table displaying our Group activities aligned with the taxonomy at an aggregated level.\n\nShare of activities compatible with the taxonomy aggregated at Group level:\n\n|                                    |                       |                          | KPI per business area                                   | KPI per business area                                             | KPI per business area                                                                    | KPI per business area                                                                              |\n|------------------------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Business area                      | Revenue  (MNOK)  2023 | Share  of total  revenue | Share aligned  with the  taxonomy  (based on  turnover) | Share aligned  with the  taxonomy  (capital  expenditures- based) | Share aligned  with the  taxonomy  weighted  against total  revenue (based  on turnover) | Share aligned  with the  taxonomy  weighted against  total revenue  (capital  expenditures- based) |\n| Banking  32)                       | 1,013                 | 13 %                     | N /A                                                    | N/A                                                               | N/A                                                                                      | N/A                                                                                                |\n| Insurance (non-life and life)  33) | 624                   | 8 %                      | 0.85 %                                                  | 1.0 %                                                             | 0.1 %                                                                                    | 0.1 %                                                                                              |\n| Asset management                   | 6,267                 | 79 %                     | 3.53 %                                                  | 3.65 %                                                            | 2.8 %                                                                                    | 2.9 %                                                                                              |\n| Total                              | 7,904                 | 100 %                    |                                                         |                                                                   |                                                                                          |                                                                                                    |\n| Average KPI                        |                       |                          |                                                         |                                                                   | 2.9 %                                                                                    | 3.0 %                                                                                              |",

Non-life insurance is a so-called 'enabling activity' that contributes to better climate adaptation within other sectors and industries, in addition to general climate resilience.\n\nStorebrand o/ffers non-life and health insurance to Norwegian customers. In order to analyse the proportion of non-life insurance premiums covered by the taxonomy, Storebrand has segmented insurance activities according to product categories de/fined in the Solvency II regulations. 35) In addition to classifying products according to Solvency II, the product categories must refer to a policy on climate-related risks in order to be fully covered by the taxonomy. 36) Our interpretation, along with the /financial industry in Norway, is that if the product does not speci/fically mention that it excludes compensation as a result of climate-related risks, it is considered eligible in the taxonomy. Most of our non-life insurance products have additional coverage de/fined by the natural damage regulations and will hence be eligible. 37) Activities related to health insurance are included in the reporting, but as Storebrand only owned 50 per cent of the business in 2023, only half of the activities are reported in our calculation.\n\nNon-life insurance products in Storebrand, de/fined under Solvency II and name climate-related risks, equals to 98 per cent of the total insurance premium. The rest of our insurance business is not covered by the taxonomy.\n\n## Our work to ful/fil the criteria for signi/ficant contribution to climate adaptation\n\nThe EU taxonomy has identi/fied non-life insurance as an economic activity that signi/ficantly contributes to climate change adaptation. In 2023, targeted work was initiated to make our property-related insurance policies for the corporate and private market aligned with the taxonomy.\n\nA dedicated working group, consisting of product managers, actuaries, product developers and\n\nsustainability advisors, focused on ful/filling the /five technical criteria for signi/ficant contribution to climate adaptation (read more below). This includes modelling and pricing of climate risk, product design, innovative insurance solutions, data sharing, and measures after damage, with a particular focus on circular claims settlement solutions.\n\nThis systematic work has resulted in our insurances within property for the corporate and private market now being aligned with the taxonomy for 2023, which make up 24 per cent of our non-life insurance products.\n\nOngoing e/fforts include data sharing with the municipalities through 'Kunnskapsbanken', changes in terms and conditions to provide customer incentives and climate adaptation measures rewards, and integration of forward-looking climate risk into risk assessments and pricing. Further focus will be directed towards improved understanding and integration of climate risk as well as increased expertise in climate adaptation to provide better advice to customers.\n\nThe taxonomy work for other insurance products, such as car and travel insurance, will be conducted in accordance with the EU taxonomy's requirements for a signi/ficant contribution to climate adaptation in 2024. The aim is to make 80 per cent of our taxonomy eligible products aligned with the taxonomy. Cooperation with strategic partners, including research and professional environments, the insurance industry, municipalities, authorities, and customers, will be strengthened to ensure a holistic approach to climate adaptation.\n\n## 1. Use of a forward-looking climate risk model in pricing\n\nStorebrand uses Geodata as a data provider to assess climate-related risk, especially storm water issues that are not covered by the National Natural Damage Pool (Naturskadepool). Geodata uses data from the Norwegian Climate Service Centre to evaluate forward-looking climate risk through various scenarios. We will work with Geodata to develop scenarios and analyses, create a solid",

We also use map solutions to visualise climate risk for individual buildings and neighbourhoods. This enables a price determination based on scenario analysis and gives us a basis for dialogue with the policyholder about identi/fied climate risks.\n\n## 2. The insurance product contains incentives for loss prevention\n\nFor property-related insurance (including contents) in both the private and corporate market, we reward customers with loss prevention solutions that reduce the amount of storm water. The reward is subject to the terms and conditions, and involves removal of the deductible in the event of damage related to storm water/extreme rainfall. In the corporate market, we carry out manual risk assessments on many insured buildings. By using map tools, new data and climate adaptation expertise, we will discount the risk pricing to customers who demonstrate and manage climate risk through loss prevention measures. Going forward, we will continue strengthening our expertise in climate adaptation and loss prevention with the aim of reducing climate-related damage.\n\n## 3. Innovative insurance coverage that meets requirements for climate adaptation\n\nStorebrand o/ffers insurance policies that cover climaterelated damage, including natural disasters and operational disruptions. We distinguish between damages covered by the Norwegian Natural Damage Pool and those covered directly by Storebrand. Our private and corporate insurances for property have no exceptions and covers damages that goes beyond what the Norwegian Natural Damage Pool o/ffers. A risk transfer that Storebrand o/ffers is that our insurance contracts automatically cover losses from rent.\n\n## 4. Sharing data with public authorities\n\nStorebrand facilitates collection of data on natural and water damage for preventive civil security purposes. This is an important contribution from the non-life insurance industry, and we collaborate with public authorities and\n\n## About 'Kunnskapsbanken' (the Knowledge Bank)\n\nKunnskapsbanken', developed by the Norwegian Directorate for Civil Protection (DSB), provides an easily accessible overview of risk and vulnerability. The platform gathers relevant information to increase knowledge about natural events and strengthen preventive civil security locally, regionally and nationally. DSB has collaborated with public and private enterprises to develop 'Kunnskapsbanken', which contains data from, among others, the Norwegian Water Resources and Energy Directorate (NVE), the Norwegian Climate Service Center, Norwegian Meterological Institute (MET), the Norwegian Public Roads Administration, private insurance companies and the state's natural damage scheme. It provides accessible maps, /figures, graphs (statistics), de/finitions of terms, and reports, including post-event evaluations.\n\nFinance Norway to ensure that this work contributes to strengthening climate adaptation work in Norway.\n\nGood  data on damages is important in loss prevention work. The insurance industry possesses the best available statistics and facts on climate damage. The insurance industry can contribute to climate adaptation e/fforts by sharing these data with public authorities, especially municipalities. This is important knowledge for the municipalities in their calculation of risk and vulnerability, for example when determining areas or rebuilding after damage. Knowledge of risk and vulnerability is important to reduce the probability of unwanted events occurring, and to reduce consequences if it does occur.\n\nStorebrand and the non-life insurance industry share claims data with 'Kunnskapsbanken', and the data is available for those working with preventive measures and spatial planning in counties and municipalities. Identifying areas with repeating weather and natural damages enhances the ability to calculate risk of new damage events occurring. Hence, 'Kunnskapsbanken' will provide national and local authorities with important tools for identifying the greatest risk and which assets are most vulnerable, thus providing a better basis for decisionmaking in planning processes and adaptation work.\n\n## 5. Deliver the highest possible standards in claims settlements\n\nDelivering good and e/fficient claims settlements is important to us. No less than 83 per cent of claim settlements are reported digitally. We o/ffer emergency help through 'Storebrand Road Assistance' or our alarm centre when damage occurs. In 2023, with signi/ficant natural damage in Oslo due to the extreme weather event 'Hans' and torrential rain, we have implemented digital inspections to minimise unnecessary driving and ensure quick help regardless of location of the damage.\n\n## Do No Signi/ficant Harm (DNSH)\n\nInsurance that signi/ficantly contributes to climate adaptation must comply with the criterion of not causing signi/ficant harm (DNSH). In our non-life insurance business, the DNSH criterion is linked to environmental objective 1 in the taxonomy, which is climate change mitigation. This means that insurance of activities involving extraction, storage, transport or manufacture of fossil fuels or insurance of vehicles, property or other assets dedicated to such purposes must be excluded from the calculation of sustainable non-life insurance premiums. This applies to corporate insurance, not retail customers. None of our customers were considered to fall within the DNSH criteria in 2023.\n\n## Minimum Social Safeguards\n\nAn activity must satisfy certain minimum social and governance requirements to be compliant with the taxonomy. As a company  bound by the minimum requirements de/fined in international and national legislation, Storebrand also requires that our suppliers and partners comply with the 10 principles of UN Global Compact, which include human rights and workers' rights. We are also obliged to report annually in accordance",

The denominator includes total investments globally, with the exception of exposures to central authorities, central banks and supranational issuers.\n\nThe category 'Financial' includes companies that are de/fined as NACE sector = K. All other investments end up in the category 'Non-/financial'.\n\nWe have also assumed that companies required to report given the Article 19a or 29a do so. The category 'exposures to /financial and non-/financial undertakings not subject to Articles 19a and 29a of Directive 2013/34/EU' contains companies registered in an EEC (EEA) country that have not reported taxonomy /figures, under this assumption.\n\nThe results show the weighted average of the value of all investments aimed at /financing or associated with taxonomy-eligible economic activities, in relation to the value of total assets covered by the KPI, with the following weights for investments in companies:\n\nBased on turnover: 3.53 per cent (with a value of MNOK 36,430)\n\nBased on capital expenditures: 3.65 per cent (with a value of MNOK 37,669)\n\nIn addition, we see that 90 per cent of the value of all investments are not covered by the taxonomy in this year's reporting, which has changed signi/ficantly from 2022 when we reported that only 0.01 per cent of our investments were covered by the taxonomy (which means that 99.9 per cent of our investments were not covered in 2022). This shows that several companies have been covered by and are reporting on the taxonomy this year.\n\n## Data sources\n\nWe use third-party data providers to collect taxonomy /figures for listed equities and bonds as we have an investment universe of more than 4,700 companies, which makes it almost impossible to obtain the information directly from the companies.\n\nData from various sources is used to calculate taxonomy /figures for various asset classes in our asset management.\n\n- \u00b7  For listed equities and bond investments, reported data from the companies is used, which is obtained via Sustainalytics. We have compared most of the data providers and evaluated them carefully before choosing to work with Sustainalytics.\n- \u00b7  For real estate investments, Celsia is used to calculate base /figures for taxonomy aggregation.\n- \u00b7   For infrastructure, detailed reported /figures from the operators are used.",

Shareholder matters\n- 4. Annual Accounts and Notes\n- 5. Ap/fiendix\n\nStorebrand is a retail bank. The loans are mainly mortgages with a smaller proportion of unsecured credits. Activities related to households (including purchase and ownership, rehabilitation and new construction of housing) are activities de/fined in the EU taxonomy under environmental objective 1 'Climate change mitigation', while mortgages are one of the exposures that must be reported by the bank according to the taxonomy. Storebrand has assessed activities related to purchase and ownership.\n\nIn the calculation of what is covered by the taxonomy within the bank's exposure, we have chosen not to include unsecured credits 38) in the assessment of taxonomy eligible and taxonomy aligned, but these are included in the total balance.\n\nThe 2023 reporting includes a new assessment of the entire balance, which has led to a reduction in the proportion covered by the taxonomy. This is because we have included all the elements on the balance sheet, including 'loans and advances', 'debt securities' and 'equities' for both /financial and non-/financial companies. Due to the lack of taxonomy data for these other assets, we have reported that most of them are not covered by the taxonomy, nor taxonomy aligned. We will in 2024 work to improve this part of the reporting.\n\nIt is worth noting that the calculation linked to '/flow' is more uncertain due to data quality and limited access to data.\n\nWe are continuously working to improve data quality and access to data going forward.\n\nThe Green Asset Ratio (GAR) represents the total proportion of taxonomy aligned activities, and constitutes 7.18 per cent of the total balance. Of this year's new loans, which are referred to as '/flow' in the EU taxonomy, this amounts to 6.26 per cent.\n\n## Assessment of taxonomy aligned activities\n\nThe report on activities aligned with the taxonomy includes lending to the housing categories apartment, detached house, semi-detached house and townhouse, for buildings that were built before 2020. The limitation is due to a lack of data and ongoing development regarding the adopted Norwegian threshold values for signi/ficant contribution.\n\nRequirements before and after 2020:\n\n- \u00b7  The taxonomy has di/fferent technical requirements for buildings built before versus after 31 December 2020 .\n\n## \u00b7  Buildings built before 2020:\n\n- -Substantial contribution refers to the top 15 per cent of the building stock to qualify for the substantial contribution criterion.\n- -NVE, commissioned by OED, surveyed the Norwegian building stock and came up with a proposal on threshold values for di/fferent housing types.\n- -The proposal roughly includes homes with energy rating A, B and some with C.\n- -It has not been /finally decided whether the proposal will be adopted by KDD/OED or whether it will be sent for consultation.\n- -Finance Norway's position is that it should be sent for consultation.\n- -In the absence of agreed values, Storebrand has received an assessment from a third party, Eiendomsverdi, about what quali/fies as top 15 per cent.\n- -This is used for our reporting on taxonomy-aligned economic activity for the 2023 reporting, and we will follow developments in terms of adopted thresholds for future reporting.\n\n## \u00b7  Buildings built after 2020:\n\n- -Substantial contribution refers to the national interpretation of 'Nearly Zero Energy Building'.\n- -In Norway, a guide was published in 2023 to assess this, with a correction for the assessment of detached houses at the beginning of 2024.\n- -Although it is positive that the guide is available, buildings built after 2020 are excluded from taxonomy-aligned reporting due to missing data for the remaining criteria to avoid signi/ficant damage (DNSH criteria).\n- -In 2024, focus will be directed at  obtaining more information related to the DNSH criteria for these homes.\n\n## Methodology from Eiendomsverdi\n\nIn the absence of NVE's proposal being adopted as threshold values for the top 15 per cent of the building stock, Storebrand has chosen to use its own calculated values from Eiendomsverdi. Their energy calculation model is based on NS3031:2014 for calculating the energy performance of buildings. The calculation is monthly stationary, in the same way Enova uses for homes. The model has several adjustment options, but requires a minimum of information on location (municipality), year of construction, housing type and area in order to estimate energy consumption.",

Shareholder matters\n- 4. Annual Accounts and Notes\n- 5. Ap/fiendix\n\n## Climate change\n\nStorebrand's largest impact on climate change originates from /financed emissions through our investments. Because we are a signi/ficant owner and manager of assets with global positions, we see climate change as one of the areas where we can indirectly contribute positively or negatively to society. To reduce the negative impact on climate change, we have de/fined science-based and veri/fied targets for our investments.\n\nWe are exposed to physical and transition risks through our investments, as these risks can a/ffect the fundamental value of our investee companies. The risk may be somewhat mitigated through our science-based targets. Market risk associated with over- or underinvestment relative to market expectations has also been identi/fied.\n\n99\n\nIn non-life insurance, we may be a/ffected /financially due to potential increase in claims settlements as a result of climate change. However, this risk can be mitigated by adjusting insurance contracts over time, since such climate changes are more relevant in the long term. The risks associated with the operation of our own o/ffices and banking activities are mainly related to reputational risks.\n\nThis chapter describes the following areas: Climate and environmental strategy, Carbon accounting summary, and Climate risks and opportunities.",

Shareholder matters\n- 4. Annual Accounts and Notes\n- 5. Ap/fiendix\n\n## Climate and environment strategy\n\n## Why\n\nWe want to reduce negative impacts on climate from our own operations, products and services. We have clear expectations towards companies we invest in and our suppliers and partners in all business areas.\n\nStorebrand can have a relatively signi/ficant e/ffect on climate, particularly through our investments. Climate change has the potential to a/ffect Storebrand's ability to provide long-term returns for our investors and customers, for example due to exposure to physical risk and transition risk in asset management. The Banking and Insurance business areas may also be negatively a/ffected, through higher insurance payments and increased frequency of claims settlements as a result of climate change and more extreme weather.\n\n## Our strategy\n\nOur pension, savings and investment services are powerful tools to meet key challenges needed to help realise the UN Sustainable Development Goals. As a signi/ficant asset owner, insurance provider and asset manager, we also see that climate change can have a material impact on Storebrand. Our investment portfolios may contribute to the transition to a low-carbon society. Read more about this in the chapter 'A driving force for sustainable investments'.\n\nStorebrand's ambition is to contribute to achieving the Paris Agreement and a maximum temperature increase of 1.5\u00b0C.  We will not use carbon o/ffsets as a means to achieve our climate targets, but as an instrument to support the transition to a low-carbon society. We believe that carbon o/ffsets are an important tool for putting a price on carbon and stimulating innovation and investments in green technology.\n\nOur operations should contribute to accelerating the transition to a low-carbon society. Climate change poses a major risk to the world and our business. At the same time, the green transition presents major business opportunities, and successful management of climate change will require substantial investments. We will be a driving force for ambitious climate targets within investments, as well as climate adaptation measures in line with good loss prevention insurance activities.\n\nStorebrand shall prepare a climate transition plan for the Group as a whole, including the subsidiaries within asset management, banking and insurance during 2024. The plans will further specify how our businesses will contribute to reducing emissions in line with the Paris Agreement.\n\nIn the Group strategy for sustainability from 2023, Storebrand stated the ambition to contribute to implementing the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF). As an asset owner, asset manager and pension- and insurance provider, changes in natural ecosystems may have a major impact on our operations. Storebrand will be a leading player towards governments and businesses to ensure that the global targets from the GBF are transformed into national and company-speci/fic targets, regulations that ensure access to data on nature and biodiversity, and frameworks that enables better nature risk reporting. As an investor, Storebrand aims to be a leading player in the /field and secure investments that may halt the loss of nature and biodiversity. 39) Storebrand shall consider nature-related risks in our insurance activities.\n\n## Own operations\n\nWe have set a target to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 7.6 per cent per year from the 2019 level in our own operations, in line with the 1.5\u00b0C target and the conclusions of the UN Emissions Gap report 2019. To reduce emissions, we are working to become more energy e/fficient, reduce waste generation, increase proportion of recycled waste, and reduce our carbon footprint from business travel and commuting. We have the following science-based targets for our own operations, which were published in January 2023 and veri/fied by the Science Based Targets Initiative in December 2022:\n\n- 1. Storebrand commits to reduce absolute emissions (scope 1-2) by 52 per cent by 2030, with 2018 as the base year\n- 2. Storebrand commits to continue with annual purchase of 100 per cent renewable electricity until 2030 40)\n\n## Investments\n\nWe have committed to investment portfolios with net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. In order to realise the overall goal, several sub-targets have been established:\n\n- \u00b7  Reduce the carbon footprint 41) of Storebrand's total investments in equities, corporate bonds and real estate by 32 per cent by 2025 (base year 2018)\n- \u00b7  15 per cent of AuM invested in 'solutions 42) ' by 2025\n- \u00b7  Dialogue with and special attention to the 20 largest emitters in our company portfolio\n\nWe also have the following science-based targets for our investments. The portfolio targets cover 89 per cent of our total investments and lending activities measured in AUM per 12/31/2023.",

Shareholder matters\n- 4. Annual Accounts and Notes\n- 5. Ap/fiendix\n- \u00b7  42 per cent of listed equities and corporate bonds (based on invested funds) should have set validated science-based targets (SBTi) by 2027\n- \u00b7  Reduce scope 1-2 emissions from real estate investments by 64 per cent (per square metre) for residential buildings and 71 per cent for commercial buildings by 2030 (against base year 2019 43) )\n\n## Our approach\n\n## Own operations\n\nWe have a Group-wide climate strategy with requirements for ourselves and our suppliers, as well as speci/fic targets to reduce our carbon footprint. 44) We apply the precautionary principle when it comes to environmental management. Since 2009, Storebrand has been EcoLighthouse certi/fied, and we publish developments in our environmental and climate e/fforts annually. Since 2008, we have compensated for greenhouse gas emissions from own operations. Storebrand purchases electricity from renewable energy sources with guarantees of origin and ensures that the power production takes place in the same countries as the electricity consumption. We seek to purchase guarantees of origin for renewable energy from power plants with the least possible impact on nature and the environment during establishment and operations, and advocate available documentation from power producers. For 2023, we purchased, among other, guarantees of origin 45) through Becour for hydropower from the power plants \u00d8vre Forsland (225 MWh) and Sjona (2,269 MWh).\n\nThere is a Group unit, as well as a cross-functional working group with representatives from operations, real-estate and sustainability who follow up targets on energy and water consumption, waste production and recycling in the o/ffice premises to ensure that we reach the emission goals. The group meets quarterly and agrees on improvement measures.\n\nIn 2023, we focused on reducing energy consumption at the head o/ffice at Lysaker through the following measures:\n\n- \u00b7  Improve control of water volumes and energy consumption.\n- \u00b7  Expanded use of refrigerators for surplus food.\n- -Storebrand Grab & Go was launched in 2022 to reduce food waste. Employees may put surplus food from internal events or meetings in refrigerators for the enjoyment of other colleagues or departments, rather than throwing it away.\n- \u00b7  Reduced energy consumption in periods when the o/ffice has lower activity (e.g. holidays).\n\nWe also arranged an internal clothes swap day where employees brought their own clothes to exchange at our head o/ffice in Lysaker. The aim was to raise awareness of clothing consumption, help increase the level of reuse and motivate employees to take measures that can reduce their own climate footprint.\n\nIn 2023, we held an internal sustainability day, focusing on internal knowledge sharing about the opportunities within sustainable investments and sustainable cafeteria operations.\n\nSPP works purposefully with internal measures to mobilize the organisation. They meet once a week to discuss measures towards speci/fic targets. In the cafeteria, they serve the daily 'most climate-smart dish'. E/fforts are also being made to share information with employees about how they can reduce food waste.\n\nIn 2023, the number of /flights in the Group increased and we exceeded the target level in CO2 emissions from air travel. We are now roughly back to the same level as in 2019, before the pandemic. During this period, we have increased the number of employees from 1,742 to 2,308 and have increased our presence in markets outside Norway and Sweden. We are working diligently on measures to reverse this trend, including new business travel guidelines and assessing updated internal carbon prices.\n\nEmployees are encouraged to consider the need for travel and use public transport for essential journeys. The Group has an internal carbon tax on /flights. The cost is charged to the employee's department. The carbon tax is used to purchase carbon credits and to support climate actions in our own operations to reduce future emissions. Our managers get insight into their department's travel habits in a digital report. The report was further developed in 2023 to provide us with increased insight into the drivers behind air travels and implement mitigative measures.\n\nIn 2022, Storebrand ordered the planting of 30,000 mangrove trees for 2023. We have also purchased CO2removal certi/ficates from the Norwegian start-up company 'Inherit Carbon Solutions'. Inherit is developing a new method for removing CO2 emissions from the atmosphere by capturing and storing CO2 generated by biogas production from food waste and sewage. The emissions captured by Inherit will be stored in the Northern Lights CO2 storage project in 2024.   In 2023, Storebrand entered an agreement with Klimate, a supplier of carbon o/ffset projects. Klimate helps its customers choose high-quality projects by analysing, among other things, the permanence, added value, certi/fication standards and veri/fication procedures for carbon removal projects. Storebrand wants to choose projects that are reliable and credible, and has chosen a portfolio composed of projects within carbon capture (1.7 %), improved weathering (6 %), biochar (15 %) and reforestation/conservation (77.3 %).\n\nIn 2022, 'Shift to Nature' was started as a project initiated by Storebrand through the Norwegian network Skift. Since then, nature has been integrated into Skift's strategic",

The project led to speci/fic local measures, with grass lawns at the head o/ffice at Lysaker converted to pollinator-friendly plants.\n\nTogether with the Skift network, Storebrand contributed to creating a practical guide for greener real estate management, that propose /five 'menus' with speci/fic measures 46) . As a continuation, Storebrand participated in a working group in 2023, together with Deloitte, Skift and WWF. The work included dialogue with Standard Norway, which is preparing a guide to stimulate increased biodiversity in the management of green spaces. Nature Accelerator Programme, a knowledge programme on nature, was also launched for Skift's members, in which Storebrand participated. The purpose was to provide knowledge about new developments in the /field of nature and biodiversity, as well as participate in discussions on how nature can be integrated to a greater extent in businesses. The 'Shift to Nature' project has evolved from a local focus, with speci/fic measures on own properties, to lifting companies' work with nature at a more strategic level related to reporting and delivering on the UN's Global Diversity Framework.\n\nAt Storebrand, we are planning several internal measures for 2024, including:\n\n- \u00b7  Measures to reduce emissions from business travel\n- \u00b7  Increase recycling of paper cups used by employees\n- \u00b7  Measures to promote biodiversity on our own property\n- \u00b7  Digitization initiatives that allow us to reduce the amount of paper letters to customers by 15 per cent (2023 baseline)\n- \u00b7  Strengthen internal training\n\nOn our website and below, you can learn how we work with responsible procurement 47) .\n\n## Investments\n\nStorebrand has a separate climate policy for investments describing how we plan to reach net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. We expect companies to address the impact their operations have on climate, both in terms of risks and opportunities. Read more about how we work with climate-related impact in our investments in the chapter 'A driving force for sustainable investments'.\n\nOur expectations are for all companies in our portfolios, with enhanced focus on companies with the most signi/ficant emissions across scope 1-3, as well as companies we believe pose the highest climate risk to our portfolios. As biodiversity and nature are closely linked to climate change, we have speci/fic expectations towards companies in sectors such as agriculture. The following main principles form the basis for our work with portfolio companies:\n\n- \u00b7  Investment decisions shall be made in accordance with scienti/fic consensus\n- \u00b7  Reorientation of capital towards low-carbon, climateresilient and transition /fit companies\n- \u00b7   Avoid investments that contribute signi/ficantly to climate change\n- \u00b7  Use position as an active owner to stimulate ambitious climate targets at portfolio companies\n- \u00b7  Make it easy for customers to understand how they can contribute to a low-carbon society\n\nThe climate policy for investments can be found in its entirety here.\n\nOther relevant policies are further described on page 63.",

Storebrand assesses climate risk both for the value chain, especially customers, and for its own business. The risk is assessed in the same framework as other business risks. The overall risk, including climate risk, is summarised in a risk analysis which is processed by Group management and the Board at least annually. The risk process is described in more detail in the chapter 'Risk'. The assessments provide a basis for analysing which measures should be taken to reduce the risk or realise opportunities.\n\nWe have used the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) as a framework. Our TCFD index can be found on page 165.\n\n## Scenario analyses\n\nHistorical events have limited relevance for assessing climate risk, and we therefore need to assess risks linked to di/fferent scenarios. Storebrand uses three di/fferent climate risk scenarios: One in which the transition to low emissions is rapid, so that the goal of limiting warming\n\n## A: Rapid transition\n\nThe scenario is based on the 'Divergent Net Zero' scenario.\n\nClimate policy is signi/ficantly changed and technology development is rapid. The scenario is ambitious, and the goal of zero emissions by 2050 is achieved. There is at least a 50 per cent probability that global warming will be limited to less than 1.5 degrees.\n\nThe costs associated with the transition will be signi/ficant, especially for consumers, which is exacerbated by limited coordination between countries and sectors. The use of oil for transport is phased out very quickly, while the decline in the fossil fuel share for energy supply and industry is more variable. The scenario assumes modest use of carbon capture and storage.\n\nto 1.5 degrees is reached, one scenario in which the transition comes later, but warming is still limited to approximately 2 degrees and one scenario where emissions continue to be high, and warming is 3 degrees or more. The scenarios are based on the Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS), which has been established by central banks and supervisory authorities.\n\n## Stress test transition risk\n\nTransition risk will have both positive and negative e/ffects on various companies and other actors. In all transition, the negative e/ffects will typically come /first, even though the positive e/ffects may become at least as great over time. The stress test is based on the Rapid Transition scenario.\n\nTo quantify the risk from a rapid transition to zero emissions, Storebrand has de/fined a stress test that includes investments in fossil fuel companies, 48) climaterelated solutions companies 49) and real estate. Fossil fuel companies are stressed -50 per cent, while solutions companies are stressed +10 per cent. Real estate is stressed -5 per cent.\n\n## B: Delayed transition\n\nThe scenario is based on the 'Delayed Transition' scenario.\n\nLack of new restrictions means that economic growth will be fossil-fuelled. CO2 emissions grow until 2030. After that, policies are tightened considerably, including a large increase in CO2 prices. This results in a rapid decline in emissions after 2030, down to zero in 2050.\n\nThe overall decline in emissions will be large enough that there is a 67 per cent probability that global warming will remain below 2 degrees.\n\n- 48)  Investing companies that have fossil exposure. Key /figures are linked to PAI. 1.4 of the SFDR regulations.\n- 49)  Investments in companies within renewable energy and green bonds.\n\n## C: Current policies\n\nThe scenario is based on the 'Current Policies' scenario.\n\nLimited understanding of the crisis and short-term political priorities mean that future stricter measures will not be implemented to any great extent. Measures introduced to limit emissions are continued.\n\nEmissions will grow until 2080. Global warming is expected to be around 3 degrees, but with a signi/ficant risk of an even greater increase. This will lead to major physical climate changes that are irreversible.",

This will also a/ffect Storebrand's investments and the consequences are greatest in the 'Current policies' scenario. To quantify the risk from physical climate change, Storebrand has de/fined a stress test that includes equities, bonds and real estate. Equities are stressed -20 per cent, real estate -10 per cent and bonds -2 per cent.\n\nStress test physical climate risk scenario current policies - Storebrand Group\n\n|          | Share of  total  portfolio   | Contribution  to total  discarding   | Stress   |\n|----------|------------------------------|--------------------------------------|----------|\n| Stocks   | 46 %                         | -8.8 %                               | -20 %    |\n| Bonds    | 45 %                         | -0.9 %                               | -2 %     |\n| Property | 6.7 %                        | -0.7 %                               | -10 %    |\n| Other    | 2.3 %                        | 0 %                                  | 0 %      |\n| SUM      |                              | -10.4 %                              |          |\n\nPhysical climate change, assuming that the current policy is continued, is also expected to have major consequences for the assets Storebrand manages, and the stress test shows an overall decline in value of approximately 10 per cent. Physical climate change and associated market consequences are very long-term. In practice, the consequence will probably take the form of a somewhat lower returns over many years, rather than as an immediate fall in value. But the /financial market is pricing in all new information. An immediate stress test may therefore make sense, even if the actual consequences occur far in the future.\n\n## Life insurance\n\nThe life companies' operations are little a/ffected by changes in climate and environment. But the /financial results are a/ffected if climate risk results in a lower return on investments, including real estate, because the income depends on the value of the investments.\n\nThe life insurance obligations may also change if the economy and /financial markets are a/ffected by climate risk. The risk can have an impact both in terms of increased disability and as a cost for the guaranteed pension obligation.\n\nThe oil and gas industry means that the Norwegian economy may be particularly vulnerable to transition risks. A rapid transition to low emissions can lead to increased unemployment in companies in the fossil fuel sector, but also a/ffect other industries because economic activity is slowed down. There has historically been a correlation between economic growth and the level of disability. A consequence of the transition to low emissions may therefore be increased claims and a need for increased reserves for disability for Storebrand Livsforsikring. In the short term, the risk is greatest in the 'Rapid transition' scenario. But overall, the risk can be greatest in the 'Delayed transition' scenario if the necessary transition is postponed.\n\nStorebrand Livsforsikring and SPP's cost of the guaranteed retirement pension obligation may increase if climate risk results in lower investment returns over time, especially if they are lower than the guaranteed return. The risk is greatest in the scenario 'Current policies'.\n\nIn periods, the attractiveness of our pension products may be reduced if the sustainability adaptation of the portfolio yields a lower return than competitors. The risk is particularly high in processes with new customers because historical returns are emphasised. The di/fference in returns compared with competitors may be particularly noticeable for SPP because the portfolios are completely fossil-free. Given Storebrand's adaptation, the risk is greatest in the 'Delayed transition' and 'Current policies' scenarios.\n\nStorebrand Livsforsikring and SPP emphasise sustainability as a di/fferentiating factor for customers. This creates a risk that customers who do not prioritise sustainability will prefer other suppliers, especially for occupational pensions. There is also a risk that Storebrand Livsforsikring and SPP will lose market shares because competitors invest more than us in sustainability adaptation or are more successful in developing and communicating relevant sustainability criteria. This is a risk in all scenarios.\n\n## Real estate\n\nFor real estate investments, Storebrand has a direct in/fluence on many choices related to investment and operation. Storebrand can therefore greatly in/fluence the environmental and climate risk from the real estate portfolio through the choices we make for the individual property, both related to how the choices a/ffect the world around us and Storebrand.",

Shareholder matters\n- 4. Annual Accounts and Notes\n- 5. Ap/fiendix\n\nThe global construction industry is estimated to account for 40 per cent of all CO2 emissions, energy consumption, consumption of material resources and waste production, and has a major impact on society. The main strategy for reducing risk is active ownership. Both when managing real estate in operations and when upgrading buildings, the negative e/ffects and risks for society are to be reduced by optimising energy consumption, water consumption, material consumption, waste volumes, waste sorting and thereby reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Increased circularity and safeguarding nature are also part of the strategy. Storebrand works actively to adapt the portfolio to climate change and the 1.5-degree target and has set science-based emission targets for 2030. This work reduces the impact on the environment compared with if the same properties were managed/owned by organisations that do not have an equally active strategy.\n\nFor investor customers, the biggest risk is lower investment returns due to changes in asset value, lower rental income or higher costs.\n\nAcute physical climate risk is already a/ffecting properties, also in Scandinavia, although the risk is far lower than in other parts of the world. The risk is assumed to increase in the future, especially under the 'Current policies' scenario. Extreme rainfall and /flooding stand out as the single most important factors. Micro-location and property resilience a/ffect vulnerability to damage, increased insurance costs and other costs. Chronic physical risks such as sea level rise are more long-term, but can have both direct and indirect /financial impacts. In the worst case, property can become unusable and unmarketable.\n\nTransition risk in the form of increased public requirements and taxes, as well as climate-related market requirements are most prevalent in the 'Rapid Transition' and then the 'Delayed Transition'. Under the 'Current policies' and 'Delayed transition' scenarios, there is a risk of weakened returns in the short or medium term as a result of overinvestment or too early investment in relation to what the market values. On the other hand, the value of the properties may fall if we do not manage potential stranded assets proactively enough. For example, developments in EU regulations suggest that commercial property with a low energy rating may become illegal to rent out as early as 2027.\n\nOur active ownership strategy reduces these risks. Proactive analysis and implementation of measures will optimise adaptation to future climate change, regulations and the 1.5-degree emissions trajectory, both for the portfolio and individual properties. Ensuring a good energy rating is key. Sustainability certi/fication (the BREEAM system or equivalent) gives the properties both a quality rating and an important basis for improvement plans. Benchmarking through GRESB (Global Sustainability Benchmark for Real Assets) provides a corresponding grade at portfolio and manager level and supports progress towards a high global standard that reduces risk. Both frameworks include physical climate risk and transition risk as part of the overall assessment, and a high score indicates reduced risk. The share of certi/fied property is high in relation to the market. When\n\npurchasing a property, the strategy is supported by analysing the property's sustainability standard against the potential costs of bringing it up to a future-oriented standard. In two rehabilitation projects in the Norwegian portfolio in 2022-2024, the energy requirement has been reduced by 60 per cent and the energy rating has been raised from D to B.\n\nLower investment returns also a/ffect Storebrand, primarily through the fact that the Group companies Storebrand Livsforsikring and SPP Pension & F\u00f6rs\u00e4kring have signi/ficant investments in real estate, but also through the fact that management income is calculated as a share of market value. In addition, weaker returns than competitors will a/ffect Storebrand Asset Management's market position and future sales/earnings.\n\nStorebrand's real estate business is aimed at institutional customers and tenants, who also largely have their own requirements and preferences for sustainability. There is a risk of a lack of demand from investors and tenants if sustainability and climate risk are not adequately taken into account or do not ful/fil market expectations. On the other hand, Storebrand has high ambitions related to sustainability, while it is the tenants and property owners who must pay for sustainability-related investments. If the tenants or owners have lower requirements/preferences than Storebrand, it is more di/fficult to achieve the Group's ambitions.\n\n## Non-life insurance\n\nSeven of the ten largest natural events since 1980 have occurred after 2010. The major events are occurring more frequently and there is a steady increase in rainfall and frost damage. Water ingress into buildings is the damage that leads to the highest payouts in the insurance industry. Climate change will cause a greater and more frequent risk of /floods, extreme rainfall, landslides and storm surges.\n\nFor customers, climate and nature risks mean an increased risk of more extensive damage to their valuables (property, household goods, car, etc.). In the short term, the risk is prevalent in all scenarios, but will increase over time in the 'Delayed transition' scenario and even more so in the 'Current policies' scenario. It is important for customers that the insurance products they have purchased cover damage that may result from climate change and that they receive advice on loss prevention and information on how to protect their valuables. Customers must also be able to be con/fident that the insurance company can deliver good and quick claims settlement if their assets are a/ffected by climate- and nature-related damage, especially in cases where a large geographical area/many objects are a/ffected at the same time.\n\nCustomers also face the risk that insuring their home will be very expensive if the property is located in an area that is particularly vulnerable to climate and nature-related damage. The Norwegian natural perils insurance scheme, in which all insurance companies are obliged to participate in the Natural Perils Pool, helps to reduce the risk. Natural disasters covered by the pool include storms, landslides, /floods, storm surges, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, meteorite impacts and tidal waves. Water damage and",

Shareholder matters\n- 4. Annual Accounts and Notes\n- 5. Ap/fiendix\n\ndamage from lightning strikes are climate and naturerelated damages that are not covered by the pool. The natural perils pool helps to reduce the customer's risk, while at the same time it is part of a larger systemic risk that there are no incentive structures that su/fficiently contribute to natural perils being taken into account in municipalities' spatial planning.\n\nWe set strict environmental and climate requirements for our suppliers. We have required our suppliers/partners in both property and motor to do more repairs, set requirements for waste management and recycling, and requirements to use more used quality parts. Storebrand focuses on making repairs more environmentally friendly by using remanufactured spare parts to repair damage. For property, we are working actively to limit the damage and consider spot repairs rather than replacing larger areas. There is also a focus on reusing dismantled materials such as mouldings. Sophisticated drying methods are used to minimise drying time. Our partners are required to use as many environmentally certi/fied building materials as possible. The circular economy in claims settlement can help reduce overconsumption and minimise natural risks through reduced use of raw materials, waste and reduced greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nIn principle, Storebrand can increase the insurance premium when more extreme weather results in more expensive insurance claims. In practice, it is di/fficult to adapt the premium to rapid climate and weather changes. 2023 was an extreme year compared with previous years, but it is uncertain what the new normal will be. There is competition between the insurance companies, so increased premiums can lead to customers switching insurance providers. Storebrand is therefore dependent on other insurers also recognising the increased scope of natural perils. The natural perils pool has a risk-reducing e/ffect in the short term, but may contribute to necessary premium increases not being realised because the negative e/ffect on the companies' results is delayed.  In the short term, there is a risk of mispricing in all scenarios, but the risk will increase over time in the 'Delayed transition' scenario and even more so in the 'Current policies' scenario.\n\nAlthough physical risk is the most signi/ficant for nonlife insurance, transition risk may also arise in the event of a decline in demand for our products. One example could be a change in the travel insurance market, with customers travelling less and shorter distances, so that their insurance needs change and they want travel insurance that covers Norway or the Nordic region. The risk is greatest in the 'Rapid transition' scenario. Measures will then be to o/ffer a variant of travel insurance that is limited to a geographical area, and this will probably result in lower premium income. Another example is that fewer people want or need to own their own car. Measures to curb climate change may accelerate this trend. Cars will then to a greater extent be owned collectively, and this will change the market from a retail market to a large corporate market. Increased use of car sharing of privately owned cars will also result in changing insurance needs. This, in\n\ncombination with structural changes (car manufacturers taking a greater role in the value chain), will in the longer term reduce the market for car insurance. There is also a risk of lost opportunities or late sustainability adaptation if we are too late in launching or adapting products and cover to meet changing customer needs as a result of climate change.\n\n## Banking\n\nStorebrand Bank is a retail bank with daily banking services, deposit and lending products. For small and medium-sized enterprises, the bank does not o/ffer lending/credit products. The bank thus has no direct exposure to companies in the fossil sector, to energyintensive companies or companies with directly or indirectly high greenhouse gas emissions. The bank's lending is essentially household mortgages.\n\nStorebrand Bank's activities can have a signi/ficant climate impact if Storebrand contributes to the /financing of homes that are not environmentally sustainable, resulting in greater demand for such properties. The bank will then contribute to greater spending on homes with higher energy consumption and higher emissions.\n\nThe EU Buildings Directive on housing is a legislation that aims to improve energy e/fficiency and reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the building sector as part of the 'European Green Deal'. The directive provides minimum requirements for energy classes. It requires all commercial or public buildings to reach at least Class F by 2027 and Class E by 2030, and all residential buildings to reach at least Class F by 2030 and Class E by 2033. Buildings that do not meet these standards cannot be sold or rented out. The customer has a climate-related transition risk linked to the development of the value of the home as a result of the directive and as a result of high energy prices. Homes with poor energy labels may have reduced marketability, require signi/ficant and costly upgrades and have high energy costs. The value of these homes may then fall, and running costs may be higher than for other homes. In the short term, the risk of a fall in value is greatest in the 'Rapid transition' scenario.\n\nThe EU's building directive also poses a transition risk for Storebrand's results because homes with poor energy labelling can contribute to both an increased loss rate given default and an increased probability of default. Risk mitigation measures include Storebrand Bank's updating of the year of construction and technical standard, as well as the energy class, of the security properties in the portfolio.\n\nThe bank's physical climate risk is assessed in relation to how exposed homes are to various natural events such as torrential rain, landslides, quicksand, /floods, storm surges. The bank is signi/ficantly a/ffected by how exposed the properties are to such hazards now and in the future. Storebrand collects information on all mortgaged properties on how exposed they are to such physical risks through Eiendomsverdi.",

Includes direct and indirect emissions; air travels, other travels, energy consumption and waste (Scope 1-3). The emissions are calculated in Cemasys AS in accordance with the GHG protocol (The Greenhouse Gas Protocol). The Nordic mix emission factor is the basis for calculating location-based emissions from electricity.\n- -Scope 1: Tonnes CO2-equivalents, measured in accordance with the GHG protocol.\n- -Scope 2: Tonnes CO2-equivalents, measured in accordance with the GHG protocol.\n- -Scope 3: Tonnes CO2-equivalents, measured in accordance with the GHG protocol.\n- -CO2e emissions per full-time employee due to air travel (Scope 3, tonnes): Emissions from business air travel by employees in the Group's Norwegian and Swedish operations.\n\nGreenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from equity investments and bonds\n\n- \u00b7  GHG intensity of equity and bond investments: The baseline /figures for the GHG intensity calculations are based on data from our data provider. Based on SFDR's de/finition of Principal Adverse Impact Indicator 1.3. and TCFD de/finition. The total GHG intensity of investments is the sum of companies' GHG emissions over company revenues, weighted for our ownership in the respective companies. The unit of measurement shows GHG emissions per million NOK in sales revenue. The method is the same for stocks and bonds.\n- \u00b7  Total GHG emissions from equity investments: tonnes CO2e Scope 1-2: A company's GHG emissions are distributed over a company's enterprise value and multiplied by our ownership.  Based on SFDR's de/finition of the Principal Adverse Impact Indicator PAI 1.1.\n- \u00b7  Total GHG emissions from corporate bond investments: tonnes CO2e Scope 1-2: A company's GHG emissions are distributed across a company's enterprise value and multiplied with our ownership. Based on SFDR's de/finition of the Principal Adverse Impact Indicator PAI 1.1.\n\nGreenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from real estate investments (Norway and Sweden)\n\n- \u00b7  GHG emissions direct real estate investments: GHG emissions from direct real estate investments under management in Norway and Sweden. Investments include both directly owned properties and real estate investments managed wholly or partly on behalf of external third parties. Includes direct and indirect emissions (scope 1-3), including tenants' energy and water consumption as well as waste generation. The carbon footprint is calculated in CEMAsys according to the Greenhouse Gas Protocol (GHG). The Nordic mix emission factor is the basis for calculating locationbased emissions from electricity.\n\nGreenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from real estate investments (Norway, Sweden and Denmark)\n\n- \u00b7  GHG emissions direct real estate investments, residential buildings: tonnes CO2e / kg CO2e per m2. Scope 1-2: GHG emissions from direct real estate investments in residential buildings under management in Norway, Sweden, and Denmark. Investments include both directly owned properties and real estate investments managed wholly or partly on behalf of external third parties. Includes direct and indirect emissions (scope 1-2), including tenants' energy consumption, according to SBTi-validated targets. The calculation is done in CEMAsys according to the GHG protocol (The Greenhouse Gas Protocol).\n\nFor Denmark, area-based emission factors from the PCAF (Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials) database are used 63) . Fixed emission factors have been used for 2019 - 2023. In addition, the Nordic mix emission factor is used for calculating locationbased emissions from electricity and a residual mix for calculating market-based emissions from electricity.",

Ap/fiendix\n\n## Own employees\n\nStorebrand has a signi/ficant in/fluence on employees' daily work life and engagement, although the extent of the in/fluence is largely limited to internal conditions in Storebrand. We want our employees to be brave pioneers who challenge and creatively contribute to /financial security and wellness for our customers. We believe that our employees are one of our most important sources of innovation, development and growth. In realising this potential, Storebrand plays an important role as an employer by facilitating and stimulating a culture for learning and continuous skills development.\n\n'People /first' is Storebrand's strategy for organisational and employee development. It enables the organisation and our people to deliver on ambitious business goals, while at the same time ensuring that we can adapt to continuous change in a world characterised by increasing uncertainty.\n\n115\n\nIn 2023, we continued to facilitate a culture and structure for learning and skills development tailored to each employee and the organisation's needs. It is important for us to plan and facilitate future competence needs, since this may create competitive advantages and increase future pro/fits.\n\nOur work with diversity and equal opportunities may yield indirect /financial gains as a result of external attention and a good reputation. Our work with sustainability also contributes to a good reputation and attracting motivated talents.\n\nThis chapter describes the following areas: A culture for learning, Engaged, competent and courageous employees, Diversity and equal opportunities and Working environment and HSE.",

Ap/fiendix\n\n## People First\n\n## Our strategy\n\nWith our 'People First' strategy, our ambition is to be an employer that attracts and retains the best talent. We will develop an organisation that every day strives to give our customers a future to look forward to. We do this by delivering /financial security and wellness to our clients through a wide range of /financial products, services and advice. To achieve our long-term business goals, we facilitate a culture for learning and a generous and inclusive working environment where trust and collaboration are at the core. This will help ensure that we have both the expertise and commitment to be dedicated advisors to our clients.\n\nHow we work and develop the organisation Cooperation and trust are some of the things that should de/fine us. With skilled employees and good processes, we  work e/fficiently and increase our results because we spend less time on micromanagement and coordination. Our strategy is to become the best at converting expertise into value creation. At Storebrand, we say that you as an employee should both create value and become valuable.\n\nAn important input factor in the People strategy is learning. In order to provide customers with what they need in a simple and understandable manner, we need to develop. In general, we know that lack of growth is one of the main reasons why people want to quit their jobs. We believe in a growth  adapted to each employee's strengths and potential. Low turnover and low sickness absence show that the strategy is robust.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe key to unlock our group strategy is, and has always been, our people. That is why we say 'People First'.\n\n## Why is it important to us?\n\nThe key to succeeding with our corporate strategy is the people working with us. That's also why we say 'People First' and actively apply this strategy in our daily work. We believe that investing in our people means investing in company growth.\n\nThe People strategy is important for Storebrand in order to be an attractive employer, both for those who work with us today and those who will work with us in the future. We do this by, among other things, o/ffering meaningful tasks, a good working environment, attractive conditions, opportunities for learning and growth, involvement in decision-making processes and focus on feedback and recognition.\n\nIn the following sub-chapters, we describe how we have practiced our culture of learning where engaged, competent and courageous employees experience inclusion and belonging, well supported by a structure with routines, rules and processes to safeguard health, safety and environment (HSE).\n\nSee chapter 'The Storebrand Group's report pursuant to the Norwegian Transparency Act' for a description of relevant guidelines and policies we have implemented that apply to all employees in the Group.",

Ap/fiendix\n\n## A culture for learning\n\n## Why\n\nLearning is key to improving performance and developing a diverse culture of innovation in a hybrid work model. We conduct both internal and external courses and training programs, but most of the learning and development takes place in our daily work. That's why a culture that promotes learning, sharing, and collaboration is important.\n\n## Our strategy\n\nOur ambition is to build a learning culture with a high degree of psychological safety. We have a positive impact on our own employees by providing a stimulating, inclusive and psychologically safe work environment, where they can grow professionally and personally. Employees must dare to experiment, fail and be open about what they master. It should feel safe to provide input, di/fferent perspectives and feedback. Our learning culture shall also be characterised by employees taking responsibility for their own development as well as that of their colleagues.\n\nIn addition to a strong learning culture, we will have a targeted o/ffer of knowledge networks, courses and programs via platforms that give participants a good learning experience and at the same time provide us with data to improve the o/ffer.\n\nAll employees should be able to learn throughout their employment, in order to master, develop and be of increasing value to colleagues and the organisation as a whole. The manager and employee continuously follow up on learning and development that takes place in everyday life. Twice a year, managers and employees set aside time for the Growth Dialogue, which are meetings to work more strategically and long-term with plans for the individual's competence development and career.\n\n## Our approach\n\nWe o/ffered several di/fferent arenas for culture building and learning in 2023. Among the most important were:\n\n- \u00b7  Highlight what is being done in arti/ficial intelligence both within Storebrand and in society, and which speci/fic tools we can test in a safe way to learn more. An AI steering group was established across the Group where speci/fic measures and activities, including competence enhancement in AI, are discussed and implemented.\n- \u00b7  Our annual professional and employee day was conducted with the theme 'AI - a future to look forward to?'. The event was o/ffered both digitally and physically, and the content was distributed on our learning platform, so that all employees have access to it.\n- \u00b7  The workshop 'Psychological safety - what, why and how?', which was introduced in 2021, was further developed and o/ffered to even more teams. The workshops were conducted in more than 20 teams and management teams.\n\n- \u00b7  Storebrand's digital introduction program 'Smart Start' was o/ffered monthly to all new employees. The program includes four digital sessions throughout the /first month as a new employee. Participants get to know other new employees and colleagues in di/fferent parts of Storebrand, and learn more about development opportunities. In 2023, 205 new employees participated in Smart Start.\n- \u00b7  In collaboration with Front Leadership, we o/ffered programs adapted to middle managers at di/fferent levels, as well as a separate course for new leaders. In the management programme Practical Management, 50 managers participated with and without personnel responsibility.\n\nIn addition, we continued various networks and arenas for sharing experience and professional replenishment, especially for managers in the Group.\n\nA new group of managers participated in the Storebrand Academy, a management programme with participants across countries and our programme for future leaders who either hold or will take on important management and professional roles in Storebrand. In this eighth group, 24 leaders completed the program.\n\nFor employees with less than three years of experience, we implemented a development programme for young talents, Storebrand Future Impact. The goal is to engage future leaders and change agents in Storebrand, with emphasis on the development of three skills: Selfmanagement, relationships/cooperation and complex problem solving. In 2023, 22 participants completed the program. These will now become part of the alumni network consisting of former participants that serves as an arena for learning and developing also after the programme.\n\nMentoring programmes were continued. Mentors and adepts are invited to an introductory meeting to start the relationship. Then it is up to the participants to agree on the form and frequency of dialogue and cooperation. In 2023, we hosted two di/fferent mentoring programs: Mentor Program for Women, and Mentor Program for Future Impact. A total of 20 employees across the organisation participated.\n\nTo ensure access to the necessary skills, it was also important in 2023 to position ourselves as an attractive employer among students and young workers. We conducted a number of school visits and were active in social media to show what it is like to work at Storebrand. We launched our new Group Trainee Program and recruited nine trainees to commence in September 2024.",

Shareholder matters\n- 4. Annual Accounts and Notes\n- 5. Ap/fiendix\n\nWe ran the summer program for students, Storebrand Sandbox. This is a leading /fintech program in Norway, where students with di/fferent study backgrounds solve a real challenge that Storebrand and its customers are facing. Sandbox helps young talents get to know Storebrand and helps us strengthen our network among potential employees. The programme is also an important contribution to Storebrand's learning and innovation culture. This year, 15 people participated. The participants had backgrounds in economics, technology, psychology, development, entrepreneurship and design.\n\nWe also o/ffered courses and learning arenas to ensure smart use of our digital tools. For roles with additional skills needs, certi/fications and exams were conducted.\n\nDuring the year, we changed to a new learning portal in order to link a culture of learning with a structure for physical and digital courses in one place with good reporting opportunities through our HR system Workday. Here we have collected all links to e-learning and internal courses, as well as links to various external course providers.\n\nStorebrand conducts regular employee surveys. When asked about development, the survey in 2023 showed a stable high score of 8.1 out of 10. The score on questions related to supervision was 8.3 out of 10 during the year, and the score for career development remained stable at 7.9 out of 10. The score for learning has remained stable at 8.3 out of 10.\n\nIn total, more than 2,012 people participated in one or more courses. Our employees completed 17,681 hours of learning, an average of seven hours per person. However, this /figure does not provide a complete picture of all digital learning during the previous year, when many employees took courses or completed digital learning on external web-based platforms in addition to other internal platforms. Nor do we have quantitative data on ongoing physical training that takes place internally or in collaboration with external providers.\n\nWe will continue to reinforce the culture building and learning initiatives mentioned above. The goal is to maintain and improve our good results and create a culture for learning.",

Ap/fiendix\n\n## Engaged, competent and courageous employees\n\n## Why\n\nStorebrand's employees are our most important source of innovation, development and growth. Competent employees have a lasting competitive advantage that represents the most important means of gaining loyal and satis/fied customers. Our employees should be brave pioneers who challenge and innovate to create a future for our customers to look forward to.\n\n## Our strategy\n\nOur ambition is to strengthen employee satisfaction, job satisfaction and commitment through meaningful work, good management, a motivating working environment, development opportunities and trust in management. Our managers should set a clear direction and encourage employees to work together to achieve common and individual goals.\n\nOpenness is a prerequisite for motivation, trust and security. All employees shall feel that they can raise issues with management and others in the Group. Storebrand has its own ethical guidelines.\n\n## Our approach\n\nDuring 2023, we updated our key courses in sustainability, ethics, anti-corruption, money laundering, terrorist /financing, privacy, and digital trust through our e-learning system. These annual mandatory courses were conducted with digital broadcasts from our studio at Lysaker, where employees shared insights on current topics. Feedback from these courses will be used for further improvements in 2024. The Board's and senior management's annual courses in ethics, anti-corruption, money laundering, terrorist /financing, privacy, sustainability and digital trust support the Group's risk management.\n\nThe annual 'Brave Pioneer' award was conducted, and the winners were selected for initiatives that promote both internal and external development. These winners have become ambassadors who showcase Storebrand as an attractive employer.\n\nEmployee surveys, conducted once a month, included questions about the work environment, leadership, collaboration, self-determination, sustainability, and development. The additional modules on health, safety, environment (HSE) and diversity and inclusion, which were /first used in 2021 (HSE) and 2022 (diversity), were also implemented in 2023. The results support corporate management's strategic goals, and we continue to use real-time data throughout our HR system for continuous improvement.\n\nWe have continued to develop our hybrid working model with the desire for a good balance. We also strengthen the social and professional community through various digital and physical activities. The planning of our potential new headquarters, with employee involvement to shape the open-plan o/ffice, work environment, and employee experience, has been an important activity.\n\nAll employees annually con/firm that they have read and understood the code of ethics, information security, and privacy statement through our HR system Workday.\n\nOn average, 75 per cent of employees responded to the employee survey at least once in the concluding three months of 2023. We maintained a high engagement score of 8.4 out of 10, exceeding the /financial services industry average.  Improvements were identi/fied related to strengthening systematic employee development, and two initiatives in particular were implemented to lift processes in all business and Group areas and to strengthen development across the Group.\n\nThe way forward involves continuously improving e-learning courses based on feedback, continuing to conduct annual courses for senior management, and maintaining digital distributions and a/ffirmations of ethics and safety practices. Our strategy focuses on maintaining high employee engagement through regular surveys and initiatives. The evolution of the hybrid working model will continue. Planning for a new headquarters will also continue with active employee involvement.",

Shareholder matters\n- 4. Annual Accounts and Notes\n- 5. Ap/fiendix\n\n## Diversity and equal opportunities\n\n## Why\n\nIt is important that Storebrand's organisation and business operations re/flect our customers and the markets in which we operate. Storebrand's goal is to be a good workplace for everyone, regardless of background. We strongly believe in building an agile organisation and a culture characterised by trust, inclusion and belonging. Independent sustainability analyses indicate that companies that focus on diversity are more innovative and pro/fitable. We need to attract the best talent in order to create a future to look forward to for our customers, employees and society.\n\n## Our strategy\n\nStorebrand always strives to be an organisation characterised by inclusion and belonging. Storebrand will work systematically to ensure diversity, inclusion and equality through de/fined processes for recruitment, reorganisations, salary adjustments and o/ffers of management training. See more about this in the Group report 'The duty of activity and reporting' 64) .\n\n## Our approach\n\nOur approach is described in Storebrand's diversity policy and ethical guidelines, which address how the Group works against discrimination and for diversity and equality:\n\n- \u00b7  As an employer, Storebrand wants to have an organisation with a diversity that is representative of the society around us. We believe diversity allows us to understand our customers' needs and solve complex tasks in a better way. We have our own guidelines and activities for this, in addition to a diversity committee. The work is carried out in line with the so-called 4-step model, which focuses on risk mapping, assessing causes, implementing measures and assessing results.\n- \u00b7  All employees at Storebrand shall be treated equally, regardless of gender, pregnancy, parental leave in connection with childbirth or adoption, care duties, ethnicity, religion, belief, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, political views, membership in trade unions or age or any combination of these grounds.\n- \u00b7  We have zero tolerance for and work to prevent harassment, sexual harassment and gender-based violence.\n- \u00b7  Storebrand protects freedom of association, recognises the right to collective bargaining and cooperates closely with trade unions.\n- \u00b7  Employees can report matters or incidents anonymously via established whistleblowing channels, both internally and externally.\n- \u00b7  Individual qualities should be respected and valued. This is to create a diverse organisational culture.\n- \u00b7  Storebrand works systematically to ensure diversity and equality in areas such as recruitment, restructuring processes, salary adjustments and o/ffers of management training and other development measures.\n\nStorebrand's work for gender equality and against discrimination is clearly endorsed by the Board of Directors and Group Executive Management. On a dayto-day basis, the work is organised by Executive Vice President People. At Storebrand, People has a Group function that ensures that the Group ful/fils its employer responsibility and facilitates work for equality and against discrimination throughout the organisation. The work is carried out in consultation with the employees' representatives, for example in cooperation committees in all parts of the organisation, in the working environment committee (AMU), the Diversity Committee, with safety representatives, etc.\n\nThe Diversity Committee is a subcommittee of AMU and has collaborated with the People department throughout 2023 on various initiatives in diversity, inclusion and belonging. The committee has participants from the entire Group to ensure anchoring in the organisation.\n\n## Gender\n\nIn order to address gender equality and to contribute to achieving the UN Sustainable Development Goal 5 'Gender equality', we have implemented targeted recruitment measures. We strive to nominate an equal number of women and men for leadership positions and leadership development programmes. The goal is to be able to assess at least one female and one male /final candidate when recruiting for management positions.\n\nWe continued a separate mentoring programme for female employees, and in 2023 ten women participated in this. Ten women from di/fferent parts of the Group completed the talent and leadership development programme for women, FiftyFifty, in 2023. The programme is now led by AFF and consists of participants who collaborate to develop measures that promote gender equality for participants, the companies they work in, and society as a whole.\n\nAmong the participants in the Storebrand Academy and at Practical Management with Front, there were as many women as men in 2023. In the Sandbox program, eight men and seven women participated.  Among the participants in the Storebrand Future Impact programme, 45 per cent were women and 55 per cent were men.\n\nWe have regularly provided an overview of the share of female managers at all management levels. At the end of 2023, there were 38 per cent women at all management levels. We also monitor management levels 1 to 4, and there were 37 per cent women at the end of 2023. At the end of 2023, the Group Executive Management consisted of 50 per cent women. Leadership development and growth opportunities internally is something we have worked systematically on for several years to promote and further develop internal talents. Both positions in the Group Executive Management to be /filled this year were /filled by internal applicants.",

Shareholder matters\n- 4. Annual Accounts and Notes\n- 5. Ap/fiendix\n\nAmong managers who reported directly to Group Executive Management, 42 per cent were women. 40 per cent of the Group Board members were women. As a result of this work, in 2023 we were named the winner of the She Index in Norway.\n\nIn addition to our collaboration with She Index and the publication of our results on gender equality and diversity, we continued our partnership with the Women in Finance Charter. Signatory companies undertake to set internal targets for gender balance at management level and specialist positions, to have a dedicated manager responsible for follow-up, to publish status and followup regularly, and to ensure coherence between goal attainment and compensation.\n\nWe celebrated International Women's Day on 8 March with a particular focus on gender equality, the pension gap between men and women, and Storebrand's important role as a corporate citizen in working to remedy this disparity in the future.\n\nSalary levels in the Group were reviewed in cooperation with employee representatives in connection with the salary adjustment process. The review showed somewhat lower average wages among female employees than male employees. We have implemented several measures to make pay more equal for women and men, including an annual salary audit in cooperation with employee representatives.\n\n## Ethnicity, religion and belief\n\nIn 2023, we continued our e/fforts to make the recruitment and interview process as inclusive as possible. Diversity shall be highlighted as far as possible in the interview and recruitment process and in job advertisements. Candidates and employees should experience a transparent and inclusive recruitment process, both in internal and external processes.\n\nWe have worked to achieve greater variation among Storebrand's representatives in these processes, with contributions from employees and managers with di/fferent professional experience, cultural background, age and gender. We are also pleased that there was great interest in applying to the Diversity Committee in 2023, allowing us to recruit many employees with di/fferent diversity experiences from di/fferent parts of the organisation.\n\nWe have put diversity across its broad spectrum on the agenda as an integral part of our leadership programmes. This has been part of the Storebrand Academy, Practical Management with Front and through management lunches and management meetings in Norway and in Sweden.\n\nWe have also conducted more than 20 psychological safety workshops in 2023, and more than 350 of our employees have taken part in the Diversity Icebreaker workshop since 2022.\n\nIn 2023, we launched a dedicated page on the intranet about diversity in collaboration with the Diversity Committee. We created a diversity calendar that we encourage employees and managers to use actively in\n\ntheir work, especially when planning dates for social and professional gatherings.\n\nIncreased diversity and inclusion in working life has been put on the agenda through our collaboration with the Catalyst Association. In 2022, we received support from the Directorate of Integration and Diversity (IMDI) to develop an o/ffer that can contribute to increased awareness of diversity, inclusion and belonging, with a particular focus on ethnicity. All employees can take part in the result in the form of an e-learning course. In 2023, approximately 300 employees completed this course.\n\n## Life phase policy\n\nStorebrand has a strong commitment to life phase politics through a targeted focus on facilitating employees in di/fferent stages of their careers. Storebrand o/ffers employees who are 60 years and older, and employed in a 100 per cent position, the opportunity to apply for reduced working hours from 100 to 80 per cent, and to be paid 90 per cent salary and allowances. Those over the age of 62 also have the right to apply for reduced working hours if the reduction in working hours can be implemented without signi/ficant disadvantage to the business. From the age of 64, employees in a 100 per cent position are entitled to shorter daily working hours, if this is compatible with the work.\n\nEmployees over the age of 60 are free to exercise for one hour a week during working hours, as long as the exercise is compatible with the work and is clari/fied with their immediate manager.  Storebrand has its own gymnasium at the head o/ffice in Lysaker and subsidises exercise for all employees at gyms close to the o/ffice where relevant. Read more about our active corporate sports team Storebrand Sport in the next chapter on HSE.\n\nStorebrand also contributes to measures that ensure that employees who have worked for more than 20 years at Storebrand meet for social and professional activities.\n\nThe average age in the Storebrand Group was 42 years at the end of the year. The average seniority was nine years in Norway and eight years in Sweden.\n\nFor childbirth and adoption, we o/ffer permanent employees paid parental leave beyond the statutory requirements in Norway and Sweden and pay 100 per cent salary during parental leave. Employees on parental leave are guaranteed to increase one pay grade during their leave. We support /flexible working methods to facilitate the combination of work and family life. At the same time, presence at work is important to ensure development and internal mobility. Our managers are asked to pay particular attention to what the best solution is for the individual and their development and opportunities for promotion and salary increases.\n\nWe have introduced the Smart Start parenting initiative that we implemented for the /first time in 2023 to make it easier to combine work and family life and ensure a good connection to work for the individual on parental leave. This will ensure that it is easier to return after the leave of absence and that contact is maintained both with others in",

That's why we initiated several initiatives in 2023 to promote diversity, inclusion and belonging. Among other things, we participated as a supporter in Pride, to show our solidarity with those who experience discrimination because of their sexual orientation, gender identity or expression. We gave all employees lanyards in rainbow colours as a visible sign of our support. We also created a dedicated page on the intranet where we informed about our Pride participation and posted a glossary of relevant terms. In addition, our employee representatives, the Diversity Committee and the HR team conducted a course in pink competence to increase their knowledge and understanding.\n\n## Disability and exclusion\n\nStorebrand is part of Inclusive Working Life (IA), a three-part programme that aims to promote health and well-being through work. Since 2002, we have helped to prevent and reduce sickness absence through good routines for following up our employees.\n\nOur employees receive personal insurance that provides /financial security in the event of various incidents in working life, such as pension, death, occupational injury, illness and travel. These insurances are a supplement to what is paid out through the public sector.\n\nPersonal insurance is valid as long as you are employed by Storebrand. The health insurance terminates upon retirement or departure, the other insurance policies can be continued individually. Employees are still covered by insurance policies if on leave or military service.\n\n## Three party cooperation and unionised workers\n\nAt Storebrand, we are committed to having good cooperation with our trade unions, and we have a good culture and structure for this in the form of regular meeting places and arenas.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n*Growth' metric based on multiple survey results measuring the degree to which employees experience growth opportunities at the /firm\n\nStorebrand is a member of the employers' association Finance Norway, which is a contracting party to the /financial industry's collective agreements. Finance Norway represents the industry and employer interests in the annual central tari/ff negotiations with 'Finansforbundet' (the /financial services union) and the Norwegian Confederation of Trade Unions. Storebrand is bound by Finance Norway's collective agreements with 'Finansforbundet', which regulate, among other things, employees' rights related to wages, overtime pay, severance pay, employee participation, etc. Storebrand's Swedish subsidiary, SPP, is a member of the employers' association BAO (the employers of the /financial sector). BAO supports employers in negotiations with employee organisations, to promote a good relationship between employers and their employees and to safeguard the common interests of partners as employers.\n\nSPP is part of the collective agreement between BAO and 'Finansf\u00f6rbundet', as well as  Swedish Confederation of Professional Associations (Saco). The collective agreement regulates wages and general conditions of employment.\n\n## The way forward\n\nThrough our employee surveys, we achieved a stable average score of 8.4 out of 10 throughout 2023. In 2023, we continued an additional module in the employee survey with questions about diversity and inclusion so that we can compare to the results from 2022. The employees experienced that Storebrand promotes a diverse and inclusive workforce, and that you are accepted regardless of background. The degree of trust in Storebrand as an employer is high. In 2023, we scored 8.3 out of 10 on questions in the supplementary module on diversity and inclusion. This is 0.1 percentage points below the industry average, and our ambition is to lift the result in 2024. Storebrand will, among other things, work purposefully to strengthen the work on risk assessments of grounds for discrimination other than gender, with systematic analyses as a basis for measures. Furthermore, we will continue to increase diversity skills and continue our e/fforts in recruitment and development opportunities to ensure diversity and inclusion.",

Shareholder matters\n- 4. Annual Accounts and Notes\n- 5. Ap/fiendix\n\n## Working environment and HSE\n\n## Why\n\nWe want to create a safe and inclusive working environment for all our employees, and this is safeguarded and followed up through our HSE routines, processes and systems. Our high HSE ambitions re/flect our commitment as a responsible employer, as well as the recognition that a safe and pleasant working environment provides bene/fits, both for the individual and as a competitive advantage for our organisation.\n\n## Our strategy\n\nStorebrand's long-term ambition is to ensure a safe and secure working environment for all employees, both physically and mentally, as well as protect the environment in which we operate. We work systematically on measures, including mapping and risk assessments, action plans and annual cycle to manage and reduce identi/fied risks, training and updating internal guidelines and routines. We continuously and systematically improve and adjust HSE processes through training and evaluation.\n\nThe Group has a stable and low sickness absence rate below 3.5 per cent, in line with the target level, and zero physical injuries. The goals help to clarify our long-term commitment to creating a safe, healthy, and inclusive working environment, integrated into our HSE work.\n\n## Our approach\n\nThrough regular surveys, performance appraisals and annual HSE surveys, we identify and manage potential risks related to psychosocial factors and the physical working environment, including challenges such as work-life balance, workload, stress and musculoskeletal problems. Our approach includes action plans and systematic HSE work to prevent and reduce risk, especially related to work-related stress and physical conditions in the workplace. We adapt to changes in legislation on an ongoing basis to safeguard employees' rights and working conditions.\n\nIn 2023, Storebrand carried out six risk assessments and safety inspections to improve the working environment. The HSE system, which is available as a digital manual, is updated regularly. Our monthly onboarding program 'Smart Start' introduces HSE to new employees, and we have annual HSE activities, such as de/fibrillator courses, stress management, focus on mental health and employee surveys, strengthening health and well-being.\n\nStorebrand supports hybrid work and has support schemes for home o/ffice equipment. Collaboration with SINTEF in the Work/flex project explores the hybrid model. Employee bene/fits such as health insurance, health clinics, /flu vaccines and sports activities contribute to well-being. We want to o/ffer healthy food in the canteen to contribute\n\nto the good health of our employees. In 2023, Falck has o/ffered treatments to employees four days per week, with a physiotherapist for two days and a chiropractor two days. The number of chiropractor sessions was 873, and 681 with a physiotherapist in 2023. In 2022, there were 820 treatment sessions with a chiropractor and 630 with a physiotherapist. About two-thirds of employees in Norway are still members of Storebrand Sport. 688 employees took the /flu vaccine in 2023, an increase from 536 in 2022.\n\nOverall, the measures have a positive impact on the working environment, reduce sickness absence and strengthen well-being. Sickness absence has been at a stable, low level for several years. Sickness absence was 3.18 per cent in the Norwegian operations and 2.05 per cent in the Swedish operations in 2023, which is below the Group's target of 3.5 per cent. In Norway, short-term sickness absence in 2023 was 0.85 per cent, and longterm sickness absence at 2.33 per cent.\n\nStorebrand has well-established routines for handling complaints, harassment and other unacceptable behaviour. Our external whistleblowing channel through an audit /firm 65) received 0 reports or complaints of harassment or unacceptable behaviour in 2023. Storebrand had 0 accidents resulting in personal injury in 2023. There have been no cases of property damage.\n\nThe HSE module in the employee survey showed a score of 8.3 out of 10, which is 0.3 above the industry average. From the comments in the latest survey, it appears that many people think that Storebrand is a good place to work and a feeling that Storebrand cares about the health and well-being of its employees. From the comments, it appears that several of the employees are familiar with the various employee bene/fits, and that our employees enjoy bene/fits such as /fitness and health care, insurance, food, vaccine and work /flexibility.\n\nThe survey showed fewer comments about the physical working environment in 2023 than in previous years, which can be explained by the fact that we have had more safety inspections in 2023 due to the feedback from previous year. There are more comments than in previous years that deal with high workload and stress. In 2022, these comments dealt with expectation to be available online, but in 2023, managers received positive feedback for support and  guidance for employees on setting boundaries for high workloads. This feedback forms the basis for new HSE measures for 2024.\n\nThe results suggest that the 2023 measures were e/ffective, with low sickness absenteeism, positive feedback and active use of employee bene/fits.",

Shareholder matters\n- 4. Annual Accounts and Notes\n- 5. Ap/fiendix\n\nEmployee remuneration: compensation for management positions\n\n- \u00b7  Hay Grade: Hay Grade is a recognised job evaluation system used by many larger companies in Norway and internationally. The system makes it possible to compare pay for positions that have the same requirements for competence, experience and complexity. The system is used to compare wages for positions across the group and also against positions with the same Hay Grade in the labour market. The /figures only apply to Storebrand in Norway. Hay Grade 21-26 includes roles except CEO.\n\n## Employees represented by a union\n\n- \u00b7  Share of employees represented by an independent trade union or covered by collective agreements: The various trade unions can only enter into agreements on behalf of their own members, and only the members can be bound directly through the individual agreements. The employer does not (and does not need) an overview of where and who is organised. The central point is the standard of non-deviation, which means that the company is obliged to implement the collective agreement with the largest trade union towards employees who are not bound by another collective agreement, and who would otherwise be covered by this agreement. We know that the collective agreements that have been concluded with the Finansforbundet (The Finance Sector Union of Norway) are the collective agreements that apply to most employees and the non-departure norm dictates that the same terms apply to everyone who is not covered by other collective agreements. Skagen and Cubera in Norway and Sweden, employees in Germany, Denmark and UK are not covered.\n\nTraining and skills development\n\n- \u00b7  Average amount spent on development per full-time employee (NOK): Average amount per permanent employee spent on courses through 2023.\n- \u00b7  Average number of hours spent on development per full-time employee (hours/days): Applies to all permanent employees.\n\nHuman Capital Development - Return on Investment\n\n- \u00b7  Total revenue (NOK): Total revenue includes net income from customers' funds associated with the life business.\n- \u00b7  Total operating expenses (NOK): Operating expenses refer to all the expenses the company has from operations.\n- \u00b7  Total employee-related expenses (salaries + bene/fits) (NOK): This includes training and development programs, pensions, employment, etc., as it covers all costs directly related to employees.\n\n- \u00b7  Human capital return on investment (HC ROI) (pro/fitability): The /figure is total revenue minus (total operating expenses minus total employee-related expenses), divided by total employee-related expenses.\n\n## Recruitment\n\n- \u00b7  Number of recruitments: Number of external recruitments including permanent employees, temporary employees and interns in all countries. The /figures also include recruited employees who left the group later in 2023. Acquisitions and internal hiring is not included.\n\n## Turnover\n\n- \u00b7  Total turnover: Permanent employees who left in the last twelve months with the exception of voluntary termination agreements between employer and employee, reduction in the workforce or retirement, divided by the average number of permanent employees in 2023.\n- \u00b7  Voluntary turnover: Permanent employees who leave voluntarily (with the exception of retirements and mutual agreements) divided by the average number of permanent employees in 2023.\n\nHealth, Safety and Environment\n\n- \u00b7  Sick leave: Number of sick leave days divided by number of working days at end of the year. Sick leave in Norway includes sick children days. Sick leave in Sweden does not include sick children days.\n\nIncidents, complaints and severe human rights violations\n\n- \u00b7 Total number of incidents of discrimination, including harassment: Breach of code of conduct, cases of corruption or harassment throughout the year.\n- \u00b7  Number of complaints registered through channels for employees in the company's workforce to raise concerns: Whistleblowing cases.\n- \u00b7  Total amount of /fines, penalties and compensations for damages as a result of incidents and complaints disclosed above: Fines for breach of code of conduct, cases of corruption or harassment throughout the year.\n- \u00b7  Number of severe human rights incidents connected to the company's workforce: Violations of human rights.\n- \u00b7  Total amount of /fines, penalties and compensations for damages for the human rights incidents: Fines for violations of human rights.",

This may in/fluence society in a positive manner. Storebrand's ability to deliver /financial security and wellness is crucial for attracting customers. We want to motivate our customers to make good decisions in savings, banking and insurance by delivering customer experiences that meet their needs at di/fferent stages of life. Through good asset management and risk management, we aim to ensure that our customers receive good returns on their investments. Customer dialogue takes place in both digital and serviced channels. Our goal is to be closest to the customer, in a simple and sustainable way. Storebrand relies on openness in customer relationships to provide customers with good information about the products, and  lack of transparency may lead to costumers being in/fluenced by misunderstandings or making choices that are not favorable to them.\n\n133\n\nThe risk of human rights violations against consumers and end-users is low, but there is an inherent risk that certain groups (e.g. the elderly) /find fully digital solutions challenging, or that some customer groups /find economic language and terminology di/fficult. This is reduced through working with clear and precise communication and the possibility of verbal communication to avoid misunderstandings.\n\nThis chapter describes the following areas: Greater security and /financial wellness, Engaging, relevant and responsible advice, Digital innovator in /financial services, and Simple and seamless customer experiences.",

Ap/fiendix\n\n## Greater security and /financial wellness\n\n## Why\n\nRecent reforms in the Norwegian and Swedish pension systems have given private individuals greater responsibility for their own long-term /finances. Life expectancy has increased, and citizens can no longer count on the same level of /financial assistance from the state. Taking active responsibility for one's own /finances provides the basis for being able to live the desired life, both as an employee and a pensioner. Norwegian employees got their own pension account in February 2021. The purpose is a better overview, and control over their own pension, as well as higher payments over time. In December 2021, the Swedish government proposed to extend the transfer rights for fund insurance and custody insurance undertaken before 1 July 2007. It will be easier and cheaper for employees in Sweden to move pension funds saved from 1 July 2007 to the present. The rules on fees (maximum SEK 600) shall also cover insurance policies subscribed before 1 July 2007.\n\n## Our strategy\n\nStorebrand o/ffer our customers /financial security and wellness, as well as a future to look forward to. Through our products within savings and insurance services, we make sure that our customers have their needs covered. We will deliver /first-class customer experiences throughout all phases of life. Through good management and risk management, we will ensure that our clients receive good returns on their investments.\n\nCustomer dialogue takes place in both digital and serviced channels. Our goal is to give our customers the /financial security and wellness they want for themselves and their families, both today and in the future. We work to stimulate, and expand access, to banking and insurance services and /financial services for all.\n\nWhen customers take steps to secure their /financial future together with Storebrand, they should feel con/fident that they have made good choices. They should experience that we o/ffer relevant and good products.\n\nWe o/ffer corporate customers the full range of pension and insurance products. We provide information and advice through our adviser and distributor network to corporate clients so they can make good decisions and help their employees make better /financial decisions for their business and their employees. We work to build\n\nstrong relationships with corporate customers and their employees through comprehensive and customised follow-up. Through digital solutions, customer seminars and advice, we make it easier for corporate clients to understand their pension and insurance schemes. Simultaneously, companies' employees gain better insight into their pension and insurance. Our advisors are quali/fied and use simple and understandable communication. We believe this contributes to Storebrand being a preferred provider of pension services.\n\nThrough the communication concept 'Invest in the future', we want to motivate our customers to make conscious choices for their /financial future.\n\n## Our approach\n\nWe provide information and advice in a relevant and simple way to help customers to be aware of their own /financial situation. Storebrand has market-leading digital solutions that enable customers to take control of their own /finances.\n\nThe 'Smart Pension' service gives customers a full overview of their pension savings.  Customers approaching retirement age often have a particular need for counselling. In 'Smart Pension', customers can plan the transition to a new phase in their lives and digitally start withdrawing their pension in a way that suits them. The Kron app helps our customers to start saving in a simple way. The main goal is to make good investments accessible to everyone. This is achieved through an engaging and user-friendly platform that helps to make investments understandable and accessible. In addition, the application o/ffers good advice and helps customers choose funds based on their risk pro/file.\n\nStorebrand works to increase customers' awareness of their pension and savings. We contribute to this by communicating our products and services, in digital channels, direct customer communication and social media. More than 100,000 unique customers checked their own pension through Storebrand's digital pension services in Norway in 2023. In Sweden, over 600,000 customers logged into SPP's website in 2023 to receive information about their pension, while over 7,400 corporate customers logged in to review and manage the company's pension solutions.",

Ap/fiendix\n\n## Engaging, relevant and responsible advice\n\n## Why\n\nMany people /find it complicated to get an overview of their own /finances, pension and insurance contracts, rights and payments in di/fferent stages of life. We work continuously to improve and simplify information to our customers. Relevant and responsible advisory services are prerequisites for customer satisfaction. We will help ensure that our customers buy products and services that are relevant and appropriate for their current life situation.\n\n## Our strategy\n\nWe aim to provide the customer with /financial security and wellness by o/ffering attractive products and services. Through professional management of capital adapted to the customer's risk pro/file and time horizon, and through a wide range of products, we will contribute to growth in our customers' pension and savings capital. Through our products and services within insurance, we make sure that our customers are secured if something unforeseen should happen. Storebrand has its roots in insurance, and today we still have good reason to be proud of the products and services we provide.\n\nIn Norway, our ambition is for 70 per cent of our savings, banking and insurance advisers to be authorised. In Sweden, all our advisors are certi/fied, in line with requirements from authorities.\n\n## Our approach\n\nThe principle 'customer /first' is the starting point for all customer contact. This is re/flected in our service standards:\n\nTrustworthy - I keep my promises and I am professional\n\nCaring - I treat everyone individually, help them and give advice\n\nEnthusiastic - I am positive and exceed expectations\n\nE/fficient - I make the customer journey easy and improve the organisation\n\nOur savings advisers in Norway are authorised through the Financial Advisers Authorisation Scheme (AFR), the General Insurance and Personal Insurance Authorisation Scheme (AIS and AIP), or the Credit and Personal Insurance Authorisation Scheme. All schemes are o/ffered under the auspices of the /financial industry.\n\nOur authorisation and competence requirements are communicated to customers across digital platforms. The interaction between digital and physical customer service will become increasingly important. This interaction is essential in order to serve customers well and e/fficiently, in the channels that customers prefer. Storebrand works continuously to ensure quality in customer processes across channels and areas.\n\n'Your climate footprint' is a tool that shows the carbon footprint associated with the investments of employees' pensions and savings, compared to the footprint if the money had been invested in funds without a sustainability pro/file.  The information is available to the companies in advisory and follow-up processes, and in Norway it is available in the companies' self-service portal, 'Bedriftsportalen'. The information can be used in the companies' own reporting, to strengthen their own communication about sustainability work with owners, the market and employees.\n\nIn 2023, Storebrand acquired the /fintech company Kron to strengthen the savings o/ffer to our customers. During 2023, we welcomed around 24,000 new customers, representing a 57 per cent increase from year-end 2022. Assets under management went from around 7 billion in 2022 to around 12 billion in 2023. Kron was ranked number one in EPSI's annual survey of customer satisfaction among the investment and savings category among retail customers in Norway. The score of 77 (out of 100 points) showed that customers are very satis/fied with the  The score of 77 (out of 100 points) showed that customers are very satis/fied with the savings solution. They emphasised the simplicity of the digital solutions as an important factor.\n\nStorebrand once again became number 1 in the Norwegian Customer Barometer's annual survey of customer satisfaction among pension customers in the corporate market. The score of 74 points (out of 100 points) showed that customers are very satis/fied with their customer relationship.\n\nStorebrand's fully automated online solution, 'The Business Guide', has challenged the industry standard and made the purchase of pension and occupational injury insurance signi/ficantly easier for Norwegian companies. The business guide won the prestigious design award 'Nordic UX awards' in 2023.",

Ap/fiendix\n\n## Digital innovator in /financial services\n\n## Why\n\nStorebrand's technology platform serves as the core for creating /financial products and services. The platform must be consolidated, ensure operational stability, be resilient to cyber-attacks, comply with regulatory requirements, facilitate a high rate of change and innovation, and be cost-e/ffective.\n\n## Our strategy\n\nWe want to increase the number of satis/fied and loyal customers through good digital customer experiences. The interaction between digital services and automated processes is the key to e/fficient distribution and service, and a prerequisite for a pro/fitable and future-oriented Storebrand in the years to come.\n\n## Our approach\n\nWe work systematically to develop good digital customer experiences and automated processes through a solid technological platform and infrastructure. Storebrand Digital, which was established at the beginning of 2022, now e/ffectively supports the Group's business areas in digital service development, technology and data. The work methodology is agile and characterised by an interdisciplinary and seamless collaboration with the various business areas. In 2023, we strengthened our digital capacity in the corporate market by successfully integrating and incorporating the digital unit of Danica into Storebrand Digital.\n\nConsolidation and renewal of the technology platform is necessary to make it a catalyst for innovation and competitiveness. Transforming Storebrand's IT solutions into cloud-based infrastructure is an important part of this strategy. By the end of 2023, Storebrand /finalised a large-scale cloud transformation, involving the migration of its infrastructure to the cloud and modernisation e/fforts that included reducing technical debt, implementing infrastructure as code, and facilitate for new innovative capabilities such as generative AI. The cloud transformation contributes to a 30 per cent cost reduction (fully realised in 2025) and risk mitigation through increased operational stability (60 per cent decrease in incidents) and improved cybersecurity.\n\nIn 2023, cybersecurity has been a particular focus area due to the growing threat landscape. Actors who carry out cyber attacks are becoming increasingly sophisticated and adaptable. Storebrand strengthened cyber security in the\n\nGroup through a new cloud platform, rolling out multifactor authentication, cleaning up access and passwords at existing infrastructure providers, upgrading the PC platform, strengthening access control, establishing threat intelligence, and increasing monitoring.\n\nThrough investments in technology and de/fined digitalisation programs in each business area, we ensure competitiveness in the market. In 2023, we saw signi/ficant results from the work on end-to-end digitalisation in the corporate market. We are on track to realise a total cost saving of NOK 100 million in the period 2021-2025 (fully realised in 2026). Automated exchange of accrual history for public pension schemes through digitisation of the Public Service Pension Transfer Agreement is a good example of increased competitiveness through automation in 2023. The technology platform also contributed to signi/ficant growth in the market for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) following the launch of new digital sales solutions and partnerships.\n\nIn 2023, Storebrand completed the integration of /fintech company Kron, after the acquisition was announced in 2022. In order to realise synergies, strengthen competitiveness and ensure operational quality, work is still ongoing to integrate Kron with Storebrand's fund platform, which has an automation rate of around 97 percent.\n\nA new generation of arti/ficial intelligence, generative AI, has gained widespread prominence in 2023. Smart use of data has long been a focus area for Storebrand, where we can demonstrate tangible results such as the use of machine learning to detect insurance fraud. This model has contributed to a 20 per cent increase in detected cases of fraud in vehicle insurance. The number of disability cases granted through automated case processing increased by 100 per cent, and the use of machine learning provides 17 per cent higher precision when pricing collective disability insurance. The potential in the use of generative AI is expected to be signi/ficant. For Storebrand, we believe the opportunities lie primarily in streamlining customer service and internal work processes. We will realise the potential by investing in AI-supporting tools and the expertise of our employees, adding AI expertise to digital transformation initiatives and at the same time having a smooth scale-up in resources and investments in line with market developments.",

Ap/fiendix\n\n## Simple and seamless customer experiences\n\n## Why\n\nStorebrand's customers want and expect simple solutions to purchase and use our products and services. Digital and self-service channels are preferred by our customers, but we will o/ffer a seamless transition to help and advice from Storebrand's customer service centre.\n\n## Our strategy\n\nOur goal is to meet the customer in a personal and customised way, regardless of whether it is through digital channels or channels serviced by personnel.\n\n## Our approach\n\nStorebrand prioritises investments in technology and digital services that ensure our customers can easily reach us through their preferred channels, while also facilitating increased self-service. We recognise that customers have varying needs, and the need for personal advice may vary or change throughout their purchasing or service journey. Therefore, it is crucial that our technology platform supports a seamless transition between serviced and selfservice channels. In this way, the technology platform will also play a role in achieving a cost-e/ffective distribution between serviced and self-service sales.\n\nSince 2020, Salesforce has been our primary platform for customer follow-up across all channels. The platform supports most of the processes in sales, marketing, and servicing of individual customers, corporate customers, and institutional clients. In 2023, we established stronger connections, both technically and organisationally, between Salesforce and the inbound customer service channels.\n\nAt the same time, investments were made to create and maintain competitiveness through our digital self-service solutions.\n\nIn 2023, signi/ficant functional improvements were made to 'Bedriftsveilederen' for digital sales to small and medium-sized enterprises (SME). The purpose of the service is to be a one-stop-shop for pensions and insurance. The solution has also been made available to distribution partners such as Danske Bank. 'Bedriftsveilederen' now accounts for more than 35 per cent of sales in the corporate market within the SME segment.\n\nIn the retail market, Storebrand's leading digital solution for pensions, 'Smart Pension,' was expanded so that customers can manage their own pension withdrawals. The service is therefore a complete solution covering everything from savings to pensions, planning, and executing pension withdrawals. 'Smart Pension' saw a 6 per cent increase in customer satisfaction in the period 2021 - 2023.\n\nIn 2023, we took steps to leverage synergies between Storebrand and the investment app Kron. Kron has succeeded in creating strong engagement around personal savings and investment activities, which we continue to build upon together. In 2023, Kron topped its /first EPSI survey in the investment and savings category, and the app is Norway's most popular investment app with 4.8 out of 5 stars in both the Apple App Store and Google Play.",

This is about what values we promote, how each employee behaves and how we facilitate compliance with internal and external regulations. Our culture in/fluences, among other things, how we interact, make decisions and how we behave in everyday work.\n\nWe work determinedly to ensure that all employees through various forms of training and information are familiar with and follow our guidelines and ethical rules. To succeed, we must ensure that the way we manage risks and opportunities in privacy, ethics, information security and combating money laundering and corruption helps build a culture of open communication, trust and respect. While promoting diversity and inclusion, learning and development and accountability. Storebrand works actively to build and maintain an open corporate culture.\n\n143\n\nWe do this by, among other things, developing our employees' expertise, identifying risks and opportunities, and developing our internal regulations.\n\nOur overall compliance with laws, rules, frameworks and other regulations and requirements is also an important element in securing our position as a company that works well and systematically with sustainability. The /financial industry has a systematic risk of indirectly contributing to corruption, money laundering or other /financial crime. There is also a risk of indirectly being part of a breach of contract through supplier relationships, such as subcontractors.\n\nThis chapter describes the following areas: Privacy and digital trust, Work against money laundering and terrorist /financing, Countering corruption, Information security, A responsible value chain and Political engagement.",

Ap/fiendix\n\n## Privacy and digital trust\n\n## Why\n\nNew technology and smart use of information and personal data make us better able to understand our customers and their needs. Based on our customers' trust in us and within current regulations, we can use technology to develop better and more relevant products and services.\n\nToday's digital world has an increasing risk that personal data can go astray, be stolen or shared with unauthorised persons. Our customers and employees must be able to trust that we manage their personal data responsibly. This requires that we have good security measures, a well-established framework for data protection and good compliance with this. In addition, our employees must know how to handle personal data properly in their daily work and in our business in general.\n\n## Our strategy\n\nOur ambition is to engage our customers and build long-term relationships through /first-class customer experiences across all channels. This requires that we safeguard our customers' rights in accordance with the Personal Data Act. 74) Safeguarding personal data in a good and correct manner is a prerequisite for working purposefully with sustainability in our business.\n\n## Our approach\n\nOur guidelines for the processing of personal data contain purpose limitation, description of roles and responsibilities, and requirements for the processing of personal data. We also work systematically with information security. Through our internal control system, we set requirements, verify and improve the security of personal data in our own work processes, customer solutions and in cooperation with our partners. This is a continuous process.\n\nIf there is a breach of personal data security and the risk to our customers is assessed as medium-high or high, we contact customers directly by phone or e-mail. In such cases, we inform customers about what has happened, what measures we have taken and, if necessary, what measures the customer should take to protect their own personal data.\n\nThe Managing Director of each of the legal entities in the Group is responsible for all processing of personal data in their company. This includes ensuring that internal control procedures are implemented and ensuring regular\n\nreview of these. All managers are responsible for ensuring that employees with access to personal data have the necessary competence and are quali/fied to safeguard our customers' privacy. Managers must also ensure that employees follow our routines and guidelines for information security.\n\nAll employees must annually complete basic training in data protection. Completion /figures for our common basic training programme can be found in the table at the end of this chapter. In addition, departmentally adapted training is carried out when needed. We have a network of data protection o/fficers who provide advice and customised training, as well as assist with operational compliance work within each business area.\n\nThe protection of personal data is well integrated into our internal control systems and risk management processes. We continuously assess the privacy risks to which our customers are exposed.\n\nWe update our privacy statement at least annually as well as if signi/ficant changes are made to the use of personal data. Our electronic customer portal gives the individual customer a better overview of their own privacy settings and the opportunity to make changes. 75) On our website, Storebrand.no, we have a separate page describing how we work with privacy, where you will also /find our privacy statement. On the same page, we also provide advice and recommendations to customers on how to safeguard against online fraud. These scams often aim to trick victims into providing personal information that can be misused by fraudsters.\n\nOur approach to securing personal data and other types of information against illegal and unwanted activity is described in the subchapter 'Information security'.\n\nIncidents are reported and followed up continuously in accordance with internal and external regulations. There has been an increase in the number of non-conformity reports. Two companies in particular are responsible for this increase. The number of incidents reported internally and the number of incidents reported to the Norwegian Data Protection Authority/Integrity Protection Authority can be found in the table at the end of the chapter. Storebrand received no /fines, warnings or orders for improvements from the Data Protection Authority/ Integrity Protection Authority in 2023.\n\n- 75)  For more information on digital security and privacy: https://www.storebrand.no/en/security-and-privacy",

Ap/fiendix\n\n## Work against money laundering and terrorist /financing\n\n## Why\n\nStorebrand is a key player in the Nordic /financial market. Therefore, we have a responsibility to avoid being misused in connection with /financing of terrorism, money laundering or other forms of /financial crime. Our customers, owners, stakeholders and society at large expect us to handle this in accordance with our responsibilities.\n\nSucceeding in our work against money laundering, /financial crime and terrorist /financing is a crucial contribution to Storebrand's sustainability work. Combating this type of crime is also an important part of ful/filling our corporate social responsibility. Our e/fforts to combat money laundering and terrorist /financing are also essential to maintain our reputation.\n\n## Our strategy\n\nStorebrand shall act consistently and in compliance with all relevant legislation related to money laundering, terrorist /financing and other /financial crime. We must ensure that our companies are being misused for such purposes. This requires systematic and continuous work. We seek to achieve this through routines, training and continuous follow-up of our customers and partners.\n\n## Our approach\n\nWe have established guidelines and policies that describe and set requirements for our work against money laundering and terrorist /financing. These guidelines and policies are reviewed and approved at least annually and in the event of major changes by the Board of Directors of the Group and in all companies subject to reporting obligations. In addition to this, we have incorporated measures throughout the Group to prevent money laundering, terrorist /financing and other /financial crime.\n\nThe companies within the Group that are subject to the reporting obligations carry out at least an annual\n\nassessment of the risk of money laundering and terrorist /financing. Frameworks and routines have been established for managing risk, such as requirements for establishing new customers and for on-going follow-up of customers who are deemed to pose a risk. We also conduct internal audits and regular controls to identify and report suspicious transactions or behaviour. If we discover activity that is suspicious, this is reported to the Norwegian Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU). The number of reports we sent to the FIU in 2023 can be found in the table at the end of the chapter. Since 2022, there has been an increase in the number of reports from Storebrand. Reports have been sent on suspected money laundering, terrorist /financing, tax evasion and suspected labour market crime.\n\nAll employees are required to know our guidelines for preventing /financial crime. They also conduct our basic training programme on /financial crime, money laundering and terrorist /financing every year. This training is part of the introductory programme for all new employees. Completion /figures can be found in the table at the end of the chapter. In addition, regular and di/fferentiated training is carried out for employees with speci/fic tasks related to the work against money laundering and terrorist /financing.\n\nThe training provides a basic understanding of possible risks, what rules apply and which requirements we set for our employees and managers. All senior executives and board members in the Group and its subsidiaries also receive training in how Storebrand is exposed to this type of risk, what obligations we have and how we work to prevent Storebrand from being misused as part of money laundering, terrorist /financing or other /financial crime.\n\nStorebrand is a member of the /financial crime committee of Finance Norway. The committee cooperates closely with the authorities in Norway and provides guidance to all member companies.",

Shareholder matters\n- 4. Annual Accounts and Notes\n- 5. Ap/fiendix\n\n## Countering corruption\n\n## Why\n\nCorruption has large negative e/ffects in society. Corruption can lead to economic instability and is punishable by law in all countries where Storebrand operates. In many parts of the world, corruption is one of the leading causes of poverty. The trust our customers and the outside world have in us, but also in the /financial industry in general, will be adversely a/ffected by a possible corruption case. Therefore, it is important for us to help promote ethics, active ownership, and accountability because it helps /fight corruption.\n\n## Our strategy\n\nStorebrand has a zero tolerance for corruption and other economic misconduct. We work continuously to identify internal areas with a high risk of corruption. Critical conditions or unacceptable behaviour shall as far as possible be discussed with the manager. If it cannot be resolved, it should be noti/fied so that it is handled by the whistleblowing council. The council follows up all whistleblowing cases in three phases. A preliminary investigation, processing and follow-up. What is included in each phase is de/fined in our routine for handling whistleblowing cases.\n\nIn addition to this, an important measure for identifying and being able to combat corruption and other internal misconduct is that all employees and hired personnel receive basic training in combating corruption. We have also established a whistleblowing channel, available to all employees, with the possibility to report anonymously. In addition, we work systematically with our customers, suppliers and partners to ensure that there is no corruption in our relationship with them, and that they have a conscious approach to combating corruption in their business.\n\n## Our approach\n\nStorebrand's anti-corruption work is described in our own guidelines for combating corruption, and it is also a topic in our ethical rules. The Code of Ethics is reviewed annually by the Board and all employees must annually con/firm that they are familiar with these. In addition to this, all employees receive basic anti-corruption training every year. New hires complete the training as part of their onboarding process. The training provides a basic understanding of what corruption is, where it can occur, what internal and external rules apply and what\n\nrequirements we place on our employees and managers in the work against corruption.  The training is available to external board members and all internal board members complete it annually. It is a managerial responsibility to ensure that the individual employee completes training and con/firms that they have read and understood our ethical rules.\n\nEmployees who suspect or uncover corruption or other /financial misconduct must report the incident. They can do this internally, directly to their manager, HR or compliance function or via our external whistleblowing channel. In the external channel, it is optional whether the noti/fication is made anonymously or not. We have internal regulations that describe the process for handling reports. We set clear requirements for how we should process reports and noti/fications. The purpose is to protect against retaliation, ensure the right of contradiction and ensure that all information is treated con/fidentially.\n\nTo ensure that whistleblowers, or cases where corruption or bribery is suspected, are followed up correctly and in the best possible way, Storebrand has established a Whistleblowing Council. The council includes representatives from HR, the compliance function and the legal department. The representatives on the Council are elected based on their responsibilities in the Group. Representatives shall resign if they are disquali/fied based on professional roles to ensure that they are not directly involved in the cases they are considering. The Whistleblowing Council follows its own guidelines for handling and following up reports of breaches of ethical rules, possible corruption cases or cases involving internal misconducts in its work. The number of cases handled by the council that have resulted in consequences can be found in the table at the end of this chapter. The consequences of whistleblowing are assessed speci/fically in each case. Any violations are followed up by the manager in the areas where they occur and by HR. The starting point for the assessment is external and internal regulations. In our ethical rules, we have established a sanctions matrix.\n\nThe compliance function is responsible for the basic training programme, intranet pages and general information and advice on countering corruption. Completion /figures for our common basic training programme can be found in the table at the end of this chapter.",

As a /financial institution, the Group's digital solutions and infrastructure are critical for society. We manage large amounts of information and assets on behalf of our customers. Due to our position in the market, our customers, suppliers, partners, and employees, are attractive targets for various threat actors.\n\nDigital attacks are becoming increasingly sophisticated. Combined with a hybrid workday, this increases the risk of not detecting unwanted activity. If we are the victim of a cyber-attack, it can challenge customer con/fidence, lead to temporary loss of services and potentially result in high /financial costs to restore systems and data. Information security is therefore important for creating assurance and is a prerequisite for maintaining our customers' trust, the Group's reputation and our competitiveness.\n\nInformation security is about ensuring that information is correct and available only for the people who need to access to the information, when they need it. Our approach to ensuring good information security is through people, processes, and technology.\n\n## Our strategy\n\nDigitalisation and innovation of the /financial industry and of our services in particular, place increasingly stringent requirements on information security.\n\nFor Storebrand to be able to run a sound /financial business and increase our innovative strength in the years to come, a prerequisite is to have stable and secure IT-solutions and infrastructure. We therefore work continuously and strategically with information security to manage risk and increase our resilience. This further contributes to value creation for Storebrand, our owners, and our customers.\n\n## Our approach\n\nCyber risk is one of Storebrand's most important risk areas. The threat landscape for cybercrime is characterised by organised crime and an increased geopolitical sentiment. New technology enables the spread and increased automation of fraud, and an increase of targeted cyberattacks.\n\nMuch of the work with information security in the Group is carried out outside the security department. This includes in customer services, business development, and in the development of digital services. We have a robust system for security and preparedness in Storebrand, which is based on three lines of defence, international standards, and continuous improvement. We have a network of\n\nResilience & Continuity Managers (RCMs) in all business areas, and Security Champions, who help incorporate security into everything we do. The Chief Information Security O/fficer (CISO) is responsible for reporting to the Board of Directors and the Executive Management Team on the security posture and risks.\n\nStorebrand assesses cyber risk to be part of our overall risk picture, and reports on this to the Board of Directors every month. It is also summarised in the risk assessment assessed by the Group Management and the Board of Directors, including Board committees bi-annually. Cyber risk is also assessed in the annual ORSA report adopted each year.\n\nWe face a complex and dynamic threat landscape and have therefore invested in expertise and resources in preparedness, security testing, monitoring, and incident management. We have our own CSIRT (Computer Security Incident Response Team) that searches for and handles attacks, threats, and vulnerabilities. There is an increase in the number of information security incidents from 2022, due to further improving our ability to detect incidents, improving our internal control activities, and conducting more security tests. This enables us to identify deviations and vulnerabilities before they develop into incidents with consequences. The number of cases handled by CSIRT, which we categorize as security anomalies, incidents and vulnerabilities, can be found in the table at the end of the chapter. The /figures include nonconformities, incidents and vulnerabilities that could have had consequences and costs for Storebrand or others if they were not discovered in time, averted and dealt with. All cases were handled before they had consequences for Storebrand, our customers or others.  We also have a dedicated team of ethical hackers who test and improve our software security through 'purple teaming'. We participate in Nordic Financial CERT, a joint operations center that shares information about threats and attacks between /financial institutions. We also conduct regular crisis exercises based on simulated cyber-attacks.\n\nWe know that our employees are an important part of preventive safety work, and therefore we have a strategy to manage human risk and to ensure awareness of security and emergency preparedness. In our program, we o/ffer e-learning, phishing simulations, courses, presentations, competitions and various activities to motivate and train our employees. All employees must annually sign the security rules and complete our basic course in information security. Completion /figures can be found in the table at the end of the chapter.",

Ap/fiendix\n\n## A responsible value chain\n\n## Why\n\nProcurement is an area where we can in/fluence our suppliers in a more sustainable direction.  In our business, we have a signi/ficant proportion of outsourcing. This requires stricter procedures for following up working conditions, safeguarding human rights and management of environmental impacts in the value chain.\n\n## Our strategy\n\nA key objective is to avoid agreements with suppliers where production processes or products violate international agreements, national legislation or internal guidelines. Through our own operations and procurement activities, we shall contribute to sustainable development, and to ensuring that human rights and labour rights are not violated.\n\nOur ambition for 2023 was to maintain the proportion of environmentally certi/fied purchases at a minimum of 60 per cent. 76) Even though we exceeded our target, the dynamics of our supply chain and market conditions still make the 60 per cent target challenging\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n8.7 Through our procurement practices, we strive to contribute to e/ffective measures to end modern slavery and eliminate child labour in our value chain.\n\n8.8 We aim to protect labour rights and promote a safe and secure working environment for all employees, contractors and suppliers.\n\n12.5 We aim to signi/ficantly reduce waste through prevention, reduction, recycling and reuse in our supply chain.\n\n12.6 We encourage companies to adopt sustainable practices and include sustainability information in their reporting practices.\n\n12.7 We promote sustainable purchasing practices.\n\n13.2 We incorporate action on climate change into our policies, strategies and plans.\n\n## Our approach\n\nIn Storebrand's standard sustainability contractual appendix, we set clear, contractual requirements for our suppliers and business partners. 77) The document sets requirements for compliance with the UN Global Compact, Self-declaration against social dumping, Self-declaration on health, safety and environment (HSE) as well as climate and diversity, and is attached to all requests for quotation and supplier contacts. In addition to following our internal purchasing guidelines, it is a key principle that goods and services purchased shall promote our main goal of cost-e/ffective and sustainable business operations. Storebrand shall not purchase goods or services from companies on Storebrand Asset Management's exclusion list. 78) Our purchasing policy is based on the Group's governing documents and associated procedures, which are revised annually. 79)\n\nOur framework for following up the sustainability work of our suppliers follows the same general principles as for our investments, and in addition the following is factored  into our purchasing processes:\n\nWe choose - Sustainability is weighted at least 20 per cent in all purchasing processes. Through supplier mapping, we give an advantage to companies that work systematically with sustainability.\n\nWe in/fluence - We use our position as a major buyer to in/fluence suppliers and business partners to improve. We do this both when we consider entering into new agreements and evaluating existing contracts.\n\nWe opt out - We do not select suppliers, products or services that violate international treaties, national laws or internal policies. This is described in our Supplier Principles.\n\nWe conduct an annual survey of the status of the work of suppliers from which we purchase products or services worth more than NOK 1 million. As part of this work, we further developed routines for following up our suppliers in 2022, both for establishing a new third-party agreement through the follow-up system and for updating the questions we ask them on an annual basis.",

Shareholder matters\n- 4. Annual Accounts and Notes\n- 5. Ap/fiendix\n\nThe purpose of the questions we ask is to ensure that suppliers meet our expectations and to ful/fil our role as a driver of sustainability. The questions include the following categories:\n\n- \u00b7  To what extent is sustainability integrated into the supplier's strategy?\n- \u00b7  What climate performance and targets does the supplier have?\n- \u00b7   What are the supplier's diversity performance and goals?\n- \u00b7  To what extent does the supplier use environmental, quality and management systems?\n- \u00b7  To what extent does the supplier have a process in place for mapping the risk of human rights violations in its own operations and in its supply chain?\n- \u00b7  What are the supplier's most signi/ficant risks of human rights violations?\n\nBased on the responses, we assess measures that should be initiated. This is done through dialogue with suppliers. In some cases, suppliers are excluded. An extended set of questions is used for evaluating suppliers in procurement processes.\n\nIn late 2022 and early 2023, we distributed an updated survey to our suppliers. The responses were reviewed in 2023. Going forward, we will further improve the survey to re/flect the most relevant trends, develop our requirements for suppliers, lower the threshold for responding to the survey and strengthen the usefulness of the data we collect.\n\nOur most important and largest purchases include outsourcing of IT and business processes, healthcare, claims settlement and management of direct real estate investments. We consider the areas with the greatest risk and impact related to sustainability to be outsourcing (including o/ffshoring), claims settlement (car and property), and real estate management in general.\n\nStorebrand is committed to safeguarding human rights and decent working conditions in our own operations, supply chain and investments. 80) In connection with the introduction of the Transparency Act in Norway in 2022, we developed new routines and policies to better be able\n\nto identify and follow up risks related to human rights violations and decent working conditions in our supply chain and in our own operations.\n\nIn 2023, we continued our work on the due diligence framework and conducted risk and due diligence assessments of our own operations and supply chain. In the /first reporting year, the statement was included as part of our policy for human rights and responsible business conduct. As of 2024, this is reported as part of the annual report, see page 155.\n\nSince 2020, we have set ambitious climate requirements for our suppliers. In 2023, we adjusted these requirements. We maintain high ambitions, while at the same time encouraging suppliers to take speci/fic measures in their own operations rather than purchasing carbon credits in their work towards reaching net zero, and reducing the risk of greenwashing.\n\nOur updated  targets mean that by 2050, suppliers should reach net zero greenhouse gas emissions from their operations through:\n\n- 1. Measuring and reporting greenhouse gas emissions from the business\n- 2. By the end of 2025, setting science-based climate targets in line with relevant industry standards to reduce greenhouse gas emissions\n- 3. Reducing emissions as much as possible through own actions and introduce appropriate measures to compensate for own emissions that cannot be avoided\n\n## Results\n\nIn 2023, contracts of over NOK 1 million amounted to NOK 4.2 billion. This represents 88 per cent of our total purchases and includes management and development of direct real estate investments. Of this volume, 62 per cent is environmentally certi/fied in accordance with our purchasing policy. This volume is distributed among 529 suppliers, of which 176 (33 per cent) are certi/fied according to a recognised environmental management standard.",

Shareholder matters\n- 4. Annual Accounts and Notes\n- 5. Ap/fiendix\n\n## The Storebrand Group's report pursuant to the Norwegian Transparency Act\n\n- 1. Purpose and delimitation\n\nStorebrand is obliged to conduct due diligence in accordance with the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and Work on Fundamental Human Rights and Decent Working Conditions (the Transparency Act) on 01.07.2022 to conduct due diligence in line with the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises.\n\nStorebrand shall comply with universal human and labour rights, and minimise the risk of breaches through its own operations and supply chain. Own operations means in/fluence through the /financial services provided by the Storebrand Group, direct management of real estate and treatment of own employees.\n\nThis report is an account, cf. Section 5 of the Transparency Act, of the due diligence work carried out by the Group companies in Storebrand. The report describes Groupwide organisation and guidelines, as well as Group-wide risks and mitigating measures. For company-speci/fic risks, please see each company's annual reports here.\n\nThe report describes Storebrand's organisation of human rights work, guidelines, risk and due diligence assessments, associated results and implemented and planned measures by the companies that are part of the Storebrand Group. Risk and due diligence assessments have been carried out per Group enterprise and the common elements are aggregated in the current report.\n\n- 2. Organisation and supply chain\n\n## 2.1 Organisation\n\nResponsible parties have been identi/fied in each Group company to ensure that risk assessments are regularly carried out and due diligence assessments are carried out of the supply chain and business partners, as well as their own operations.\n\nThe central purchasing function works to ensure riskreducing measures when entering into contracts. The contract owners, i.e. those closest and with the highest understanding of the suppliers' business risk, have the operational responsibility for identifying risks associated with the supplier relationship and any mitigating measures before entering into a contract, and for following up the contractual relationship on an ongoing basis. The central purchasing function covers all Group companies (excluding purchasing for Eiendom, which is located in its\n\nown operational area) and is legally located in Storebrand & SPP Business Services AB, Sweden, part of Storebrand Livsforsikring AS.\n\nWhen it comes to the treatment of our own employees, Storebrand has a diversity committee with participation from the entire Group. The committee works with various initiatives within diversity, inclusion and belonging. A recruitment committee has also been established to oversee that internal hiring and promotions are done in line with guidelines, to ensure equal rights for everyone and no discrimination based on gender. Our internal HR function works closely with the business areas to ensure freedom of association for all, a diverse organisation and the absence of discrimination.\n\nThe Group's sustainability team which is formally organised in Storebrand Livsforsikring AS plays a key role in the preparation of the Group's framework and processes for the Transparency Act, and receives assistance and guidance from the Group's Legal Department as well as functions from Governance, Risk and Compliance (second line) in the Group. Governance, Risk and Compliance reports on compliance with the Transparency Act to individual boards.\n\nInformation and access requests are handled by the communications department. The department responds to inquiries from consumers and other stakeholders in accordance with the statutory requirement for a response deadline.\n\nIn practice, the routines for risk and due diligence assessments of the Group's suppliers and own operations have been implemented in the central purchasing function and in the Group companies. The CEO of each Group company is responsible for implementation in the respective company.\n\n## 2.2 Supplier relationship\n\nStorebrand has Group-wide suppliers within IT and ICT operations, o/ffice services and cleaning, accounting and /financial services and consultancy services. The Norwegian Group companies (excluding SKAGEN) share the same o/ffice and cleaning supplier in Lysaker, Oslo. The same applies to the Swedish companies in Stockholm.\n\nThe majority of Storebrand's suppliers are Nordic. A high proportion of the suppliers are within real estate management and IT/ICT.",

Guidelines\n\nStorebrand wishes to be open and transparent about its work on human and labour rights. Therefore, we have a high degree of publicly available guidelines and documents. The most important documents describing how we work to comply with human and labour rights in the Storebrand Group are discussed below.\n\n## 3.1 Governing documents\n\nAll Storebrand employees attend annual (basic) courses to ensure familiarity with the Storebrand Group's most important guidelines, such as our Code of Conduct.\n\n## 3.1.1 Sustainability guidelines\n\nStorebrand has drawn up its own guidelines for sustainability. This document sets the overarching framework for the Group's work on the Transparency Act. The guidelines have been decided by the Board of Directors of Storebrand ASA and the Boards of Directors of the operating Group companies.\n\n## 3.1.2 Code of Conduct\n\nStorebrand's Code of Conduct 87) is part of the governing documents that set the framework for how we act as a Group. Governing documents are updated at least annually. The guidelines have been adopted by the boards of all Group companies. As a supplement to our Code of\n\nConduct, a human rights policy has been drawn up 88) , which summarises how Storebrand speci/fically works with human rights and decent working conditions among its own employees, in the supply chain and with business partners and in investments.\n\n## 3.1.3 Data Protection Guidelines\n\nThe guidelines in the Group for handling personal data 89) provide guidelines for how the processing of personal data should be handled and that this is in accordance with laws and regulations. Storebrand has, among other things, dedicated data protection o/fficers and data protection advisors who both strengthen and focus the Storebrand Group's work with the processing of personal data and ensure compliance with privacy legislation.\n\n## 3.1.4 Storebrand Group Sustainable Investment Policy\n\nThe Storebrand Group Sustainable Investment Policy is the overarching governing document for Storebrand's work with sustainable investments. The document describes overall ambitions and working methods and requires compliance with international norms and conventions within human rights, environment, governance/anticorruption as well as guidelines such as the OECD Guidelines.\n\nThe guideline also describes implementation methods such as due diligence, portfolio screening, exclusions, active ownership and integration.\n\nThe guidelines apply to Group companies within the business area investment management; Storebrand Asset Management AS and its subsidiaries, including Storebrand Fonder AB, SKAGEN AS, Cubera Private Equity AS and Cubera Private Equity AB.\n\nThe Sustainable Investment Policy is based on a minimum requirement for all investments. It refers to international norms and conventions within human rights, environment, governance/anti-corruption and guidelines that we expect companies to follow.\n\nThe standard applies to all Storebrand's internally managed funds and pension portfolios, as well as externally managed funds. It does not distinguish between passive and active investments and applies to all asset classes. Furthermore, the standard has clearly de/fined analysis criteria for human rights.\n\n## 3.2 Due diligence framework\n\nStorebrand's sustainability guidelines (see section 3.1.1) set the framework for the Group's work on the Transparency Act. The following two documents are appendices to this guideline and provide further guidelines for the operational implementation of the work on risk and due diligence.",

Shareholder matters\n- 4. Annual Accounts and Notes\n- 5. Ap/fiendix\n\n## 3.2.1 Routines for assessing supply chains and business partners\n\nThis document formalises how we integrate risk assessments into the procurement process and includes risks in both supply chains and business partners. Business partners are anyone who supplies goods or services directly to the business, but is not part of the supply chain, cf. Section 3e of the Transparency Act. The routine describes how risk is to be assessed, what should be prioritised for broader due diligence and /finally how due diligence assessments should be carried out and followed up.\n\nIn the /first step, objective risk of human rights violations and decent working conditions is assessed based on four factors;\n\n- 1. Supplier's  industry\n- 2. Geographical a/ffiliation\n- 3. The speci/fic product or service provided\n- 4. Knowledge of facts that increase the risk of breaches\n\nSupplier relationships/business partners with the highest risk then undergo a broader due diligence assessment with the aim of identifying measures to reduce the risk of human and labour rights violations.\n\nRisk assessment of suppliers is integrated into Group-wide systems and implemented in the Group's risk procedure. A similar risk assessment is carried out for business partners at each Group company.\n\n## 3.2.2 Routines for assessing own activities\n\nThe purpose of this procedure is to identify and follow up risk in the Storebrand Group's own operations, i.e. impact on its own employees, in/fluence through /financial services (banking services, insurance services and asset management) and indirect in/fluence through management of the asset classes equities and bonds, real estate, infrastructure and private equity.\n\nThe principle is the same as for supply chains, i.e. those areas with an elevated risk of breaches are prioritised for broader due diligence, and risk-reducing measures and follow-up must be considered.\n\nThe routine clari/fies which roles are responsible for which assessments, in order to ensure local ownership of the businesses.\n\n## 3.3 Health, Safety and Environment (HSE) and diversity\n\n## 3.3.1 HSE policy for the Storebrand Group\n\nHealth, safety and environment (HSE) and an engaging workplace are very important to the Storebrand Group.\n\nOur HSE policy 90) lays the foundation for our strategic work in this area. We aim to be among the leading companies in the world in sustainability work, and as\n\npart of this we prioritise our employees highly. There is a relatively low probability of physical security risk in the /financial industry in general, with the exception of real estate operations where physical risk is higher. In addition to physical risk, we treat mental health, wellbeing and engagement as critical to the success of our business. The policy is owned by the Chief People O/fficer and is implemented throughout the Storebrand Group.\n\n## 3.3.2 Diversity and Equal Opportunities Policy\n\nStorebrand's organisation and operations shall re/flect our customers and the markets in which we operate. Our ambition is to be a good workplace for everyone, regardless of background. We strongly believe in building an agile organisation and a culture of trust, inclusion and belonging. External, independent sustainability analyses also show that companies with a high focus on diversity are more innovative and pro/fitable.\n\nOur policy for diversity and equality 91) sets the framework for and explains how we work in practice and are implemented throughout the Storebrand Group.\n\n## 3.3.3 Early warning mechanisms\n\nStorebrand wants to ensure a healthy working environment for all employees. An open culture with freedom of expression and free opportunities to communicate one's own opinions in the workplace testi/fies to a healthy corporate culture that bene/fits both the company and employees. Criticism and disagreement should be dealt with in an orderly, fact-based manner. For this we have a system for whistleblowing (via external supplier) which can be read more about here: Whistleblowing function.\n\n## 3.4 Purchasing\n\n## 3.4.1 Purchasing policy\n\nStorebrand's purchasing policy 92) is based on Group-wide purchasing principles and covers the entire Storebrand Group. In practice, the policy is managed by Storebrand's Group-wide purchasing team, which is legally located under the company Storebrand Livsforsikring AS and Storebrand & SPP Business Services AB.\n\nThe principles contain supplier requirements and cover all types of procurement of goods and services. The policy therefore forms the basis for all purchases made by a Group company.\n\n## 3.4.2 Attachments to suppliers\n\nSuppliers of Storebrand must sign Storebrand's sustainability vouchers. The purpose is to ensure that suppliers share Storebrand's ambitions and work purposefully with both environmental and social considerations.\n\nBy signing the attachment, the supplier con/firms the browse. other to follow the UN Global Compact's 10 core principles, including the internationally recognised human rights.",

Shareholder matters\n- 4. Annual Accounts and Notes\n- 5. Ap/fiendix\n\nThe appendix has been updated with an explicit section dealing with the Transparency Act (section 3) and is intended to ensure that the supplier works with its own subcontractors to ful/fil the same social obligations that the supplier itself signs. In addition, all suppliers must, upon request, contribute the necessary information that Storebrand collects in its work on the Transparency Act.\n\n## 4. Risk and due diligence assessments\n\nThe Storebrand Group assesses the risk of human rights violations and decent working conditions through the use of suppliers and their subcontractors, through the distribution of /financial services (banking, insurance and asset management) and through investments in companies. Through this process, an overall low risk picture for violations of human rights and decent working conditions has been revealed.\n\nIn the following sections, we highlight the Storebrand Group's most signi/ficant risk areas in light of an overall low risk level.\n\n## 4.1 Own employees\n\nThe biggest and most serious risk that our employees are exposed to is the risk of violence and threats from customers. Employees in the Storebrand Group who work in the customer front, i.e. as advisors, account managers and salespeople, and who thus have direct contact with the customer, are at times exposed to threats. Good routines have been established for dealing with this:\n\n## Training:\n\n- \u00b7  Customer advisors are trained to handle challenging and aggressive customers\n- \u00b7  Comprehensive management training in the sales and settlement departments\n\n## Routine:\n\n- \u00b7  Routines are developed in the internal HSE handbook available to employees\n- \u00b7  Personal threats reported to the police\n- \u00b7  Follow-up of employees takes place via crisis psychologist, HR and third parties\n- \u00b7  A dedicated security o/fficer has been established to handle all cases\n\n## 4.2 IT and data security\n\nAs a broad /financial group, there is an inherent risk that sensitive customer data such as names and social security numbers may go astray. Our digital solutions and infrastructure are of critical importance to society, as we manage large amounts of information for our customers both through our own systems and through important suppliers. Therefore, we can be an attractive target for a number of threat actors.\n\nInformation security is assessed by Storebrand as part of our overall risk picture. The risk is reported to the Group Board of Directors every month and summarised in the risk assessment assessed by the Group management and the Board of Directors, including board committees, twice a year. Furthermore, the risk is assessed in the annual ORSA report.\n\nStorebrand has implemented the following measures to manage this risk:\n\n## Signing contracts with suppliers\n\n- \u00b7  The risk is reviewed with all new purchases there, among other things. Privacy risks and information security risks are reviewed. The level of potential risk is assessed, and a management plan is made.\n\n## Dialogue with suppliers\n\n- \u00b7  Storebrand maintains a regular dialogue with strategic ICT service providers with the aim of reducing the likelihood of any privacy and information security risks. This is done, among other things, through semi-annual sustainability reviews.\n\n## Technical restrictions and encryption\n\n- \u00b7  APIs have been developed that provide only the necessary information to important suppliers who process data. Sensitive information is only shared when needed.\n- \u00b7  Encrypting customer data and carefully selecting hosting locations also contribute to risk reduction.\n\n## Organisation and distribution of responsibilities\n\n- \u00b7  We have dedicated Resilience & Continuity Managers with operational responsibility for security in each business area, as well as a recent Security Championship program, an internal community of employees working in digital service development. The program promotes awareness, further development and competence sharing of our software security.\n- \u00b7  The internal security function is divided into three lines of defence; Security Operations, Group Security and independent internal audit.\n- -Security Operations is responsible for security monitoring.\n- -Group Security is an internal control function and is part of Storebrand's Governance, Risk & Compliance function.\n- -Independent internal audit: Knowledgeable, motivated and conscious employees are an important part of Storebrand's preventive safety work. Storebrand therefore has a strategy to ensure awareness of safety and emergency preparedness. This includes regular safety culture measurements conducted by Internal Audit, as well as safety as an integral part of employee training.\n- \u00b7  In addition, Storebrand has an operational /first-line function for handling security incidents (Computer Security Incident Response Team).",

Shareholder matters\n- 4. Annual Accounts and Notes\n- 5. Ap/fiendix\n\n## Reporting\n\n- \u00b7  The Chief Information Security O/fficer reports regularly to the Board and CEO in all gender reports.\n\n## Cooperation\n\n- \u00b7  Storebrand is a member of Nordic Financial CERT, a joint Nordic operations centre that shares information about threats and attacks between /financial institutions, and coordinates major incidents across these.\n- \u00b7   Storebrand contributes with information sharing in the network. In this way, we contribute to mapping and understanding developments in the threat picture, internally and externally.\n\n## Competence enhancement\n\n- \u00b7  We have recently increased our investment in expertise and resources in emergency preparedness, security testing, operational security monitoring and incident management to increase the Group's overall resilience.\n- \u00b7  In addition, crisis exercises have been carried out based on various simulated cyber attacks against critical parts of Storebrand. We have improved our ability to detect incidents, improved our internal control activities and conducted several security tests. This enables us to identify deviations and vulnerabilities before they develop into incidents that have consequences.\n\n## 4.3 Operating personnel\n\nPhysical o/ffice operations, such as cleaning, is generally an industry with a high risk of violations of decent working conditions, including social dumping.\n\nStorebrand's head o/ffice in Lysaker uses a main supplier for facility and cleaning services. A structured process has been implemented for following up wages and working conditions together with the supplier. There is a low risk of using reckless chemicals, poor wages or excessive use of overtime. In addition, follow-up meetings are held with the supplier on a monthly basis and annual validations to ensure that wages are paid according to tari/ffs. The agreement is managed by Storebrand Facilities AS.\n\nSimilarly, we have a main supplier for our Swedish o/ffice in Stockholm, Sweden. An assessment has been made and the risk of human or labour rights violations is considered low. There is close contact between Storebrand and the supplier, and a clear process for follow-ups and dialogue.\n\n## 4.4 Universal design and language\n\nThe Storebrand Group has customers in a wide age range with di/fferent prerequisites and understanding of the format and content presented to them, for example in terms and conditions attachments that are sent when entering into an agreement. In the delivery of /financial services, a certain degree of professional terminology of a legal and /financial nature is required. For example, in terms of agreements and coverage in insurance contracts, interest and bank terms on deposits or in fund prospectuses.\n\nIn practice, there may be a risk that customers do not understand which agreement they enter into and what determines the price they receive. It also means that the process can be regarded as more burdensome and cumbersome for those with low competence in /financial terminology. Another example is that older age groups have on average lower digital competence than younger ones, which combined with the fact that Storebrand has few available physical premises, can be perceived as challenging. For example, we o/ffer telephone management to increase accessibility for these groups as well.\n\nStorebrand has implemented the following measures to reduce the likelihood and consequences of this risk:\n\n## Communication:\n\n- \u00b7   Increased use of verbal communication with customers to reduce the chance of misunderstandings and facilitate clari/fication of potential misunderstandings.\n- \u00b7  The direct number of the case o/fficer is stated in a letter to the customer.\n- \u00b7   Use of 'plain language' with a focus on making it clear what insurance, investment and loan terms mean for the customer.\n\n## Guidelines:\n\n- \u00b7  Preparation of guidelines for information, sales and advice and guidelines for case processing.\n- \u00b7  Increased use of internal control and regular review of routines and training to ensure and appropriate communication.",

The information is available at the aggregated level, per sector and geographical location.\n\n## Emissions from equity investments\n\nThe /figures for the carbon intensity calculations are based on data from our data provider.\n\nWe calculate /financed emissions by allocating a company's GHG emissions in scope 1 and 2 over the company's total enterprise value (Enterprice value including cash) and then multiplying it by each single position in the portfolio. This method is in line with the de/finition of 'Principal Adverse Impacts' as part of the EU's Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR).\n\n|                                                                                                                    | Results   | Results   | Results   | Results   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| Indicators                                                                                                         | 2020      | 2021      | 2022      | 2023      |\n| Total GHG absolute emissions from equities investments:  tonnes of CO2e Scope 1-2                                  | 3,113,714 | 2,504,453 | 2,492,038 | 2,297,418 |\n| Total carbon intensity from equities investments: tonnes of  CO2e Scope 1-2 per NOK 1 million in sales income  93) | 12.4      | 12.2      | 13.3      | 8.59      |\n| Coverage: % equities portfolio  94)                                                                                | 96 %      | 98 %      | 99 %      | 99 %      |\n| Total GHG absolute emissions from equities investments: tonnes of CO2e Scope 1-2, by sector                        | 95)       | 95)       | 95)       | 95)       |\n| Agriculture, forestry and /fishing                                                                                 | 10,295    | 12,591    | 8,525     | 5,116     |\n| Mining and quarrying                                                                                               | 368,065   | 309,388   | 344,392   | 219,145   |\n| Manufacturing                                                                                                      | 1,685,674 | 1,951,128 | 1,621,406 | 1,492,218 |\n| Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply                                                                | 42,295    | 64,958    | 35,275    | 26,199    |\n| Water supply; sewerage; waste management and remediation                                                           | 104,811   | 131,088   | 104,090   | 89,440    |\n| Construction                                                                                                       | 22,411    | 28,158    | 15,363    | 15,918    |\n| Wholesale & retail trade; repair of motor vehicles                                                                 | 114,969   | 123,411   | 67,896    | 75,616    |\n| Transportation and storage                                                                                         | 327,438   | 278,992   | 176,938   | 249,521   |\n| Accommodation and food service activities                                                                          | 6,382     | 7,058     | 7,239     | 10,973    |\n| Information and communication                                                                                      | 77,987    | 81,292    | 52,052    | 72,371    |\n| Financial and insurance activities                                                                                 | 138,935   | 21,906    | 30,793    | 17,327    |\n| Real estate activities                                                                                             | 13,817    | 16,326    | 10,309    | 11,440    |\n| Professional, scienti/fic and technical activities                                                                 | 2,721     | 3,391     | 8,680     | 3,353     |\n| Administrative and support service activities                                                                      | 5,764     | 3,137     | 3,887     | 4,467     |\n| Education                                                                                                          | 399       | 526       | 226       | 282       |\n| Human health and social work activities                                                                            | 4,884     | 5,263     | 2,366     | 2,184     |\n| Arts, entertainment and recreation                                                                                 | 585       | 438       | 329       | 462       |\n| Other services activities                                                                                          | 98        | 82        | 89        | 321       |\n\n- 93)  Historical /figures have been updated due to increased quality and coverage in historical /figures by including ESG by master data (Nordic Trustee) as an additional data provider.\n- 94)  Historical /figures have been updated due to increased quality and coverage in historical /figures by including ESG by master data (Nordic Trustee) as an additional data provider.\n- 95)  Emissions data by sector are based on NACE (Nomenclature of Economic Activities) codes.

This includes both directly owned properties and properties that are wholly or partly managed on behalf of external 3rd party customers. The /figures include direct and indirect emissions (Scope 1-2), including tenants' energy consumption, according to SBTi-validated targets.\n\nCalculations are made in CEMAsys according to the GHG protocol (The Greenhouse Gas Protocol).\n\nFor Denmark, emission factors based on /floor area and PCAF (Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials) European database of building emission factors are used 98) . Fixed emission factors are used 2019 - 2023. The Nordic mix emission factor is the basis for calculating location-based emissions from electricity.\n\n|

A limited assurance engagement is substantially less in scope than a reasonable assurance engagement in relation to both the risk assessment procedures, including an understanding of internal control, and the procedures performed in response to the assessed risks\n\nThe control procedures we performed were based on our professional judgment and included, among others, an assessment of whether the criteria used are appropriate, as well as an assessment of the overall presentation of the sustainability reporting. The procedures we performed were based on our professional judgment and an assessment of the risk of error, and included among others meetings with representatives from Storebrand who are responsible for the material sustainability topics covered by the sustainability reporting; review of internal control and routines for reporting key performance indicators for sustainability; obtaining and reviewing relevant information that supports the preparation of key performance indicators for sustainability; assessment of completeness and accuracy of key performance indicators for sustainability.\n\nThe procedures performed in a limited assurance engagement vary in nature and timing from, and are less in extent than for, a reasonable assurance engagement. Consequently, the level of assurance obtained in a limited assurance engagement is substantially lower than the assurance that would have been obtained had we performed a reasonable assurance engagement. Accordingly, we do not express a reasonable assurance opinion about whether the sustainability reporting has been prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the criteria.\n\nWe believe that the evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our conclusion.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nBased on the procedures we have performed and the evidence we have obtained, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the information in the GRI index for 2023 and the defined key figures for performance indicators for sustainability as of 31 December 2023 is not, in all material respects, in accordance with the applicable criteria.\n\n## Oslo, 6.

Ap/fiendix\n\n## Shareholder matters\n\nShare Capital, rights issue and number of shares Storebrand's share is listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange (Oslo B\u00f8rs) under the ticker code STB. Storebrand ASA's share capital at the end of 2023 was NOK 2,327 million. The company has 465,497,866 outstanding shares with a nominal value of NOK 5, after a capital reduction was carried out in 2023 by deletion of 6,477,024 shares in accordance with the resolution from the annual general meeting. As of 31.12.2023, the company owned 18,177,606 own shares corresponding to 3.9 per cent of the outstanding shares. Of these, 17,525,185 shares were purchased as part of Storebrand's share buyback program in 2023 with the intention of cancelling the shares. The company has not issued options that could lead to the dilution of existing shareholders.\n\n## Shareholders\n\nStorebrand ASA is among the largest companies listed on Oslo B\u00f8rs measured in terms of number of shareholders. The company has shareholders from almost all Norwegian municipalities and from 24 countries. Measured by market capitalisation, Storebrand was the 15th largest company on the Oslo Stock Exchange at the end of 2023.\n\nShare purchase scheme for employees Storebrand ASA has every year since 1996 o/ffered employees to buy shares in the company through a separate scheme. The purpose has been to link employees more closely to the economic development of the company. In 2023, almost half of the Group's employees subscribed for a total of 453,452 shares.\n\n## Share-based remuneration for Group Executive Management\n\nStorebrand's Group Executive Management shall ensure that Storebrand develops for the bene/fit of customers, shareholders and employees. The Board of Directors of Storebrand ASA believes that the share remuneration model, in which a substantial part of the Group management's remuneration is paid in the form of shares in Storebrand ASA, provides good incentives for Group management to act in line with the long-term interests of customers and owners. The table below shows how much of gross salary went to share purchases in 2023 and actual equity exposure at the end of 2023.

Ap/fiendix\n\n## Foreign ownership\n\nAt the end of 2023, the share of shares owned by foreign investors amounted to 48.6 per cent, compared with 50.1 per cent at the end of 2022.\n\nTable of contents\n\n| Norway   | 51 %   |\n|----------|--------|\n| US       | 17 %   |\n| England  | 8 %    |\n| Germany  | 5 %    |\n| Denmark  | 4 %    |\n| Other    | 14 %   |\n\n## Trading volume for shares in Storebrand\n\nIn 2023, 241 million Storebrand shares were traded, down from 313 million shares in 2022. Turnover was NOK 20,586 million in 2023, down from NOK 25,819 million in 2022. Relative to the average number of shares, the turnover rate of the share was 52 per cent.\n\n## Share price performance\n\nStorebrand had a total return of 9.8 per cent through 2023. In the corresponding period, the OSEBX index of the Oslo Stock Exchange ended at 9.9 per cent, while the STOXX Europe 600 Insurance Index had a total return of 11 per cent in the corresponding period, measured in local currency.\n\n## Dividend policy\n\nThe Board of Directors' ambition is to pay ordinary dividends per share of at least the same nominal amount as the previous year. Ordinary dividends are subject to a sustainable solvency margin of above 150%. If the solvency margin is above 175%, the Board of Directors intends to propose special dividends or share buybacks. In 2023, NOK 3.70 per share was paid in ordinary dividend for the /financial year of 2022. In addition, a share buyback amounting to NOK 1 500 million was conducted during the year, corresponding to NOK 3.22 per share.\n\n## Capital gains taxation\n\nDividends for personal shareholders are taxable. Dividends after deduction for a shielding amount shall be multiplied by 1.72. This amount is taxed at the tax rate for capital income (22 per cent), which gives a real tax on dividends of 37.8 per cent. The deduction for risk-free return is calculated by multiplying the share's basis for shielding (normally the purchase price of the share) by a shielding rate. The shielding rate is set by the Directorate of Taxes in January of the year after the income year. It is a rounded amount based on the average three-month interest rate on Treasury bills with a supplement of 0.5 percentage point reduced by the capital income tax rate. Dividends within the deduction for risk-free return are free of taxation.\n\n## Storebrand share\n\n|                                                    | 2023    | 2022    | 2021    | 2020    | 2019    | 2018    |\n|----------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|\n| Highest closing price (NOK)                        | 96.26   | 99.30   | 92.08   | 74.24   | 73.98   | 75.20   |\n| Lowest closing price (NOK)                         | 73.36   | 67.00   | 62.30   | 34.73   | 50.86   | 59.48   |\n| Closing price on 31/12 (NOK)                       | 90.04   | 85.40   | 88.52   | 64.20   | 69.02   | 61.64   |\n| Market cap 31/12 (NOK million)                     | 41,913  | 40,307  | 41,779  | 30,034  | 32,289  | 2,836   |\n| Annual turnover (1000s of shares)                  | 241,023 | 313,005 | 288,998 | 585,004 | 335,202 | 445,614 |\n| Average daily turnover (1000s of shares)           | 945     | 1,237   | 1,147   | 2,321   | 1,346   | 3,094   |\n| Annual turnover (NOK million.)                     | 20,586  | 25,819  | 22,931  | 30,552  | 21,348  | 30,477  |\n| Rate of turnover (%)                               | 51.78   | 66.32   | 61.60   | 125.10  | 71.70   | 95.30   |\n| Number of ordinary shares 31/12 (1000s of  shares) | 465,498 | 471,975 | 471,975 | 467,814 | 467,814 | 467,814 |\n| Earnings per ordinary share (NOK)                  | 7.02    | 5.07    | 6.68    | 5.02    | 4.43    | 7.89    |\n| Dividend per ordinary share (NOK)                  | 4.10    | 3.70    | 3.50    | 3.25    | 0.00    | 3.00    |\n| Total return (%)                                   | 9.77    | 0.43    | 42.90   | -7.00   | 16.80   | -4.70   |",

All receipts and payments from insurance activities are included from the insurance companies, and these cash /flows are invested in /financial assets that are also de/fined as operating activities. One subtotal is generated in the statement that shows the net cash /flow from operations before /financial assets and banking customers, and one subtotal that shows the cash /flows from /financial assets and banking customers. This shows that the composition of net cash /flows from operational activities for a /financial group includes cash /flows from both operations and investments in /financial assets. The life insurance companies' balance sheets include substantial items linked to the insurance customers that are included on the individual lines in the cash /flow analysis.\n\n## Investing activities\n\nIncludes cash /flows for holdings in group companies and tangible /fixed assets.\n\n## Financing activities\n\nFinancing activities include cash /flows for equity, subordinated loans and other borrowing that helps fund the Group's activities. Payments of interest on borrowing and payments of share dividends to shareholders are /financial activities.\n\n## Cash/cash equivalents\n\nCash/cash equivalents are de/fined as claims on central banks and loans to and claims from /financial institutions. The amount does not include claims on /financial institutions linked to the insurance customers portfolio, since these are liquid assets that are not available for use by the Group.",

Company information\n\nStorebrand ASA is a Norwegian public limited liability company that is listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange. The consolidated /financial statements for 2023 were approved by the Board of Directors of Storebrand ASA on 6 February 2024.\n\nThe Storebrand Group o/ffers a comprehensive range of insurance and asset management services, as well as securities, banking and investment services, to private individuals, companies, municipalities, and the public sector. The Storebrand Group consists of the result segments Savings, Insurance, Guaranteed Pensions and Other. The Group's head o/ffice is located at Professor Kohts vei 9, Lysaker, Norway.\n\nFor the most part, the asset side of the Group's balance sheet comprises /financial instruments and investment properties and a di/fferentiation is made between assets in the company portfolio (shareholders) and assets belonging to the customer portfolio. This split is due to the fact that the Group has a signi/ficant life insurance business in which customer assets must be kept separate from the company's assets.\n\n## 2. Basis for preparation of the /financial statements\n\nThe accounting policies applied in the consolidated /financial statements are described below.  The policies are applied consistently to similar transactions and to other events involving similar circumstances.\n\nStorebrand ASA's consolidated /financial statements are presented using EU-approved International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS\u00ae and related interpretations, as well as  Norwegian disclosure requirements established in legislation and regulations.\n\n## Use of estimates when preparing the consolidated /financial statements.\n\nThe preparation of the consolidated /financial statements in accordance with IFRS requires the management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that a/ffect assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses, the notes to the /financial statements and information on potential liabilities. Actual amounts may di/ffer from these estimates. See Note 2 for further information.\n\n## 3. Changes in accounting policies\n\nIFRS 9 and IFRS 17 have been implemented in 2023, which have had a signi/ficant e/ffect on the consolidated /financial statements.\n\n## IFRS 9 Financial instruments\n\nIFRS 9 Financial instruments replaces IAS 39, and was generally made applicable from\n\n1 January 2018. However, for insurance-dominated groups and companies which reported under IFRS 4, it was possible to postpone the implementation of IFRS 9 until the implementation of IFRS 17. The Storebrand Group quali/fied for the postponement of IFRS 9, as over 90 per cent of the Group's total liabilities per 31 December 2015 was linked to the insurance activities. For the Storebrand Group, the comparative /figures for 2022 have been restated in accordance with I F R S 9.\n\nThe Ministry of Finance has de/fined regulatory rules that give pension providers the opportunity to account for investments which according to IFRS 9 are measured at fair value over comprehensive income, at amortised cost in the customer and company accounts. Storebrand Livsforsikring use this option in the statutory /financial statement for the company. For the consolidated /financial statement, the /financial assets is measured at fair value through pro/fit and loss where the fair value option is used, as the insurance contract liabilities are measured at fair value.\n\n## IFRS 17 - Insurance contracts\n\nIFRS 17 Insurance contracts replaced IFRS 4 Insurance contracts with e/ffect from 1 January 2023. IFRS 17 introduces new principles for recognition, measurement, presentation and information about issued insurance contracts and reinsurance contracts. The purpose of the new standard is to establish a uniform practice in the accounting of insurance contracts and increased transparency between insurance companies.\n\nStorebrand mainly decided to use the fair value option at the time of transition when transitioning to IFRS 17 since the full retrospective approach was considered not to be practically feasible. This is due to access to historical information without the use of hindsight, and is particularly related to the distribution of costs, modelling of future cash /flows, identi/fication of new contracts going back in time and the division of cash /flows per reporting period.\n\nValuation according to fair value is made for insurance contracts with a coverage period of more than one year. For insurance contracts with a coverage period of one year or less than one year, the full retrospective approach is used since only information at the time of transition and future information re/flects the contracts.",

Ap/fiendix\n\nStorebrand uses the fair value hierarchy in accordance with IFRS 13. For products where there is an active relocation market, the relocation value is used as an estimate of fair value. For products where there is no active market, Storebrand uses relevant transactions as a reference to determine fair value. By using fair value at the time of transition on 1 January 2022, the di/fference between the fair value of a group of contracts and the cash /flows for ful/filment plus risk adjustment will form the basis of the contractual service margin (CSM). For all contracts measured at fair value, Storebrand has used reasonable and documentable information that was available at the time of transition on 1 January 2022 to make assessments related to the recognition and measurement of the contracts, including:\n\n- \u00b7  Determining the level of aggregation based on portfolios and pro/fitability cohorts\n- \u00b7  Determination of risk adjustment\n- \u00b7  Determination of measurement method, including assessment of criteria for using the premium allocation approach (PAA) for contracts with a short coverage period and the variable fee approach (VFA) for contracts that satisfy the de/finition of directly participating contracts\n- \u00b7  How to identify discretionary cash /flows for insurance contracts without direct participation\n\n## Accounting e/ffects of the transition to IFRS 9 and IFRS 17\n\nThe table given under section 12-3 explains which transition method is used per product category. The following tables show changes in equity and the balance sheet upon transition to IFRS 9 and IFRS 17. The transition resulted in a reduction in equity of approximately 21 per cent, of which 0.2 per cent from contracts where the full retrospective method was used. The decrease in equity is mainly o/ffset by the establishment of CSM.\n\nE/ffect of equity upon transition to IFRS 9 and IFRS 17\n\n| NOK million                                                    | 01.01.22   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------|------------|\n| Equity 31.12.21                                                | 37,709     |\n| Changes in accounting principles (IFRS 9 and IFRS 17):         |            |\n| Contractual Service Margin (CSM)                               | -11,810    |\n| Risk Adjustment                                                | -4,685     |\n| Present value of future cash /flows                            | 5,480      |\n| Risk equalization fund                                         | -547       |\n| Deferred acquistion fund                                       | -119       |\n| Value of business in force (VIF) acquired insurance business   | -1,607     |\n| Deferred tax assets                                            | 1,823      |\n| IFRS 9 -  reclassi/ficiation from amortised cost to fair value | 3,363      |\n| Adjusted equity 01.01.22                                       | 29,606     |",

With the introduction of IFRS 17, VIF is included as part of CSM and thus the total intangible assets is reduced.\n\n## Financial assets\n\nThe increase in /financial assets is due to transition to IFRS 9 and is mainly related to an increase in the valuation of debt instruments which is measured at fair value through pro/fit or loss. These instruments were previously measured at amortised cost under IAS 39.\n\n## Receivable\n\nThe decrease in receivables is mainly related to reclassi/fication e/ffects where the receivables related to direct operations in the P&C business is reclassi/fied to insurance liabilities. The decrease is related to deferred acquisition cost from the Swedish insurance business, SPP. With the introduction of IFRS 17, deferred acquisition costs is reduced, which impacts both receivables and other liabilities.\n\n## Equity\n\nThe decrease in equity is explained in the equity reconciliation above.",

With the introduction of IFRS 17, deferred acquisition cost is reduced, which impacts both receivables and other liabilities.\n\nThe accounting e/ffects of the transition from IAS 39 to IFRS 9 are presented in the table below.\n\nIFRS9 - Financial instruments to amortised cost and FVOCI\n\n| NOK million                                          | IAS  39           classi/fication   | IFRS  9           classi/fication   | Booked  value              after  IAS  39                         1.1.2022   | Fair  value             after  IFRS  9          1.1.2022   |\n|------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Financial assets                                     |                                     |                                     |                                                                              |                                                            |\n| Bank deposits                                        | AC                                  | AC                                  | 9,986                                                                        | 9,986                                                      |\n| Bonds and other /fixed-income securities             | AC                                  | FVOCI                               | 12,955                                                                       | 12,981                                                     |\n| Loans to /financial institutions                     | AC                                  | AC                                  | 67                                                                           | 67                                                         |\n| Loans to customers                                   | AC                                  | FVOCI                               | 38,086                                                                       | 38,086                                                     |\n| Loans to customers                                   | AC                                  | AC                                  | 416                                                                          | 416                                                        |\n| Accounts receivable and other short-term receivables | AC                                  | AC                                  | 10,585                                                                       | 10,585                                                     |\n| Total /financial assets                              |                                     |                                     | 72,096                                                                       | 72,123                                                     |\n| Financial liabilities                                |                                     |                                     |                                                                              |                                                            |\n| Deposits from banking customers                      | AC                                  | AC                                  | 17,239                                                                       | 17,239                                                     |\n| Liabilities to /financial institutions               | AC                                  | AC                                  | 502                                                                          | 502                                                        |\n| Debt raised by issuance of securities                | AC                                  | AC                                  | 24,924                                                                       | 25,000                                                     |\n| Subordinatd loan capital                             | AC                                  | AC                                  | 11,441                                                                       | 11,441                                                     |\n| Other current liabilities                            | AC                                  | AC                                  | 15,126                                                                       | 15,126                                                     |\n| Total /financial liabilities                         |                                     |                                     | 69,232                                                                       | 69,308                                                     |",

Provisions for losses must, in accordance with IFRS 9, be calculated based on the expected credit loss when a commitment is created and continuously assessed for impairment in subsequent periods. At the time of the transition, the expected loss (ECL) was calculated at NOK 60.4 million for the Storebrand Group. Expected loss has not changed signi/ficantly compared to the loss provision under IAS 39. The most important changes in hedge accounting for the Storebrand Group is that IFRS 9 sets di/fferent criteria for using hedge accounting than IAS 39. Under IFRS 9 there is no longer a requirement that the hedge relationship must be within a given interval, it has opened up for the possibility of rebalancing the hedging under existing hedging conditions and it has opened up to use several hedging instruments on the same hedging object. The transition to IFRS 9 has no accounting e/ffects for existing hedges.\n\nFor changes to estimates, see further information in note 2.\n\n- 4. New IFRS that have not entered into force\n\nThere are no new or amended accounting standards that have not entered into force that are expected to have a material e/ffect on Storebrand's consolidated /financial statements.\n\n## 5. Consolidation\n\nThe consolidated /financial statements include Storebrand ASA and companies controlled by Storebrand ASA. Minority interests are included in the Group's equity, unless there are options or other conditions that entail that minority interests are classi/fied as liabilities.\n\nStorebrand Livsforsikring AS, Storebrand Asset Management AS, Storebrand Bank ASA and Storebrand Forsikring AS are signi/ficant subsidiaries owned directly by Storebrand ASA. Storebrand Livsforsikring AS owns the Swedish holding company Storebrand Holding AB, which in turn owns SPP Pension & F\u00f6rs\u00e4kring AB (publ). On acquiring the Swedish operations in 2007, the authorities instructed Storebrand to make an application to maintain a group structure by the end of 2009. Storebrand has /filed an application to maintain the existing group structure. Upon acquisition of Kron AS, the company has been granted permission to conduct similar activities as Storebrand Asset Management AS for a period of 2 years from the permit in December 2022.\n\nInvestments in associated companies (normally investments of between 20 per cent and 50 per cent of the company's equity) in which the Group exercises signi/ficant in/fluence, and investments in joint ventures are recognised in accordance with the equity method.

Appendix\n\nStorebrand consolidates certain funds in the Group's balance sheet when the requirement for control has been met. This encompasses funds in which Storebrand has an ownership interest of approximately 40 per cent or more, which are managed by companies in the Storebrand Group. In the Group's accounts, such funds are consolidated fully in the balance sheet, and the non-controlling interests are shown on a line for assets and on a corresponding line for liabilities. The non-controlling interests can demand redemption of their ownership interests and, as a result of this, they are classi/fied as liabilities in the consolidated /financial statements of Storebrand.\n\n## Currencies and translation of foreign companies' accounts\n\nThe Group's presentation currency is Norwegian kroner. Foreign companies that are part of the Group and have di/fferent functional currencies are converted to Norwegian kroner. Translation di/fferences are included in the total comprehensive income.\n\n## Elimination of internal transactions\n\nInternal receivables and payables, internal gains and losses, interest, dividends and similar between companies in the Group are eliminated in the consolidated /financial statements. Transactions between the customer portfolios and the company portfolio in the life insurance business and between the customer portfolios in the life insurance business and other companies in the Group will not be eliminated in the consolidated /financial statements.\n\n## 6. Business combinations\n\nThe acquisition method is applied when accounting for acquisition of businesses. The consideration is measured at fair value. The direct acquisition expenses are expensed when they arise, with the exception of expenses related to raising debt or equity (new issues). When making investments in subsidiaries, including purchasing investment properties, a decision is made as to whether the purchase constitutes acquisition of a business pursuant to IFRS 3. When such acquisitions are not regarded as an acquisition of a business, the acquisition method pursuant to IFRS 3 is not applied. Among other things, this does not entail provisions for deferred tax such as for business combinations.\n\n## 7. Segment information\n\nThe segment information is based on the internal /financial reporting structure of the most senior decision-maker. At Storebrand, the executive management is responsible for following-up and evaluating the results of the segments and is de/fined as the most senior decision-maker. Four segments are reported for:\n\n- \u00b7  Savings\n- \u00b7  Insurance\n- \u00b7  Guaranteed Pension\n- \u00b7  Other\n\nThe segment reporting (alternatively income statement) is based on the legal entities' statutory accounts in the group, adjusted for intercompany transactions. It will be to the cash /flow approximate income statement. The income statement of the legal entities is essentially the same as IFRS, with the exception of IFRS 17 for Storebrand Livsforsikring AS and SPP Pension & Fors\u00e4kring AB. For Storebrand Livsforsikring AS and SPP Pension & Fors\u00e4kring AB, the local accounting principles are more adapted to the historical IFRS 4 reporting. Since the alternative income statement is based on the legal entities' statutory /financial statements, the group adjustments related to amortization and tax e/ffects on acquired operations are not included in the alternative income statement. The results in the segments are reconciled with the statutory income statement for each legal entity in the Group.\n\nFinancial services provided between segments are priced at market terms. Services provided from joint functions and sta/ff are charged to the di/fferent segments based on supply agreements and distribution keys.\n\n## 8. Income recognition\n\nFees are recognised when the income can be measured reliably and is earned. Return-based revenues and performance fees are recognised when the uncertainty associated with the income is no longer present. Fixed fees are recognised as income in line with delivery of the service.\n\n## 9. Goodwill and intangible assets\n\nAdded value when acquiring a business that cannot be directly attributable to assets or liabilities on the date of the acquisition is classi/fied as goodwill on the balance sheet. Goodwill is measured at acquisition cost on the date of the acquisition and classi/fied as an intangible asset.\n\nGoodwill is not depreciated, but is tested for impairment annually when assessing the recoverable amount or if there are indications that impairment has occurred.\n\nIntangible assets with limited useful economic lives are measured at acquisition cost less accumulated amortisation and any write downs. The useful life and amortisation method are reassessed each year.",

Ap/fiendix\n\n## 10. Investment properties\n\nInvestment properties are measured at fair value in accordance with IFRS 13. Income from investment properties consists of both changes in fair value and rental income.\n\nInvestment properties primarily consist of centrally located o/ffice buildings, shopping centres and logistics buildings. Investment properties are properties leased to tenants outside the Group. In the case of properties partly occupied by the Group for its own use and partly let to tenants, the identi/fiable tenanted portion is treated as an investment property. All properties are measured at fair value and the changes in value are allocated to the customer portfolios.\n\n## 11. Financial instruments\n\n## 11-1. General policies and de/finitions\n\n## Recognition and derecognition\n\nFinancial assets and liabilities are included in the balance sheet from such time Storebrand becomes party to the instrument's contractual terms and conditions. General purchases and sales of /financial instruments are recorded on the transaction date. When a /financial asset or a /financial liability is initially recognised in the /financial statements, it is valued at fair value.\n\nInitial recognition includes transaction costs directly related to the date of acquisition or issue of the /financial asset/liability if the /financial asset/liability is not measured at fair value through pro/fit or loss.\n\nFinancial assets are derecognised when the contractual right to the cash /flow from the /financial asset expires, or when the company transfers the /financial asset to another party in a transaction by which all, or virtually all, the risk and reward associated with ownership of the asset is transferred.\n\nFinancial liabilities are derecognised in the balance sheet when they cease to exist, i.e. once the contractual liability has been ful/filled, cancelled or has expired.\n\n## Measurement of impairment and doubtful /financial assets\n\nFor /financial assets recognised at amortised cost or fair value over other income and expenses, an expected credit loss shall be recognised. Expected credit loss is the di/fference between the present value of the contractual cash /flow and the probability-weighted expected cash /flow. Expected credit losses are estimated either by individual assessment (individual write-down) or by using statistical models (model-based write-down) to calculate the probability-weighted expected cash /flow.\n\nIndividual assessment with subsequent accounting of individual impairments is carried out on exposures where there is objective evidence that a loss event has occurred and that the event reduces the future cash /flows of the commitment. Individually assessed engagements are moved to Step 3, see further description of Step 3 below. Objective events may be material /financial problems on the part of the debtor, defaults, debt and/or bankruptcy proceedings for the debtor or that this is probable or payment relief caused by /financial problems. The cash /flow calculation and impairments are assessed using expected values.\n\nFor other exposures, expected credit losses are estimated using model-based write-down. The exposures are divided into di/fferent steps, see the section below on calculating expected credit loss.\n\n## Calculation of expected credit loss:\n\nSteps and steps are described in the following sections.\n\n## Step 1\n\nThe starting point for all /financial assets is step 1. Step 1 contains all /financial assets that do not have a signi/ficantly higher credit risk than for initial recognition. Financial assets with low credit risk may be exempted and in any case be in Step 1 even if the credit risk is substantially higher. In the retail market, this exception rule is not currently used. Step 1 calculates expected credit loss over 12 months.\n\n## Step 2\n\nStep two consists of /financial assets where there is a material increase in credit risk since initial recognition, but which are not in default or where there is objective evidence of loss. For /financial assets in Step 2, expected credit loss over expected maturity is calculated. The expected maturity di/ffers from the contractual maturity and is estimated as a historically observed maturity.\n\n## Step 3\n\nStep 3 consists of /financial assets that are in default and/or where there is objective evidence of loss. For engagements where there is objective evidence of loss, an assessment is made as to whether individual impairment must be carried out. For other exposures without individual write-downs, expected credit losses over expected maturity are calculated.",

Ap/fiendix\n\n## 11-2. Classi/fication and measurement of /financial assets\n\nFinancial assets are classi/fied into one of the following categories:\n\n- 1. Financial assets at fair value over other income and expenses\n- 2. Financial assets at amortised cost\n- 3. Financial assets at fair value above net income\n\n## Assets measured at fair value over other income and expenses\n\nInvestments shall be measured at fair value over other income and expenses if the purpose of the asset can be achieved both by receiving contractually regulated cash /flows and selling /financial assets. The terms of the contract shall, at speci/fic times, provide cash /flows that are solely the payment of principal and interest outstanding thereon.\n\n## Assets measured at amortised cost\n\nInvestments to be measured at amortized cost are assets whose purpose is to hold the assets in order to receive contractually regulated cash /flows which are solely the payment of principal and outstanding interest thereon.\n\n## Assets measured at fair value over net income\n\nA /financial asset is classi/fied at fair value above net income when it does not come under measurement at fair value over other income and expenses or at amortized cost.\n\nWith the exception of derivatives, only a limited proportion of Storebrand's /financial instruments fall into this group.\n\n## Fair value above the net income after the fair value option\n\nA signi/ficant proportion of Storebrand's /financial instruments are classi/fied as  fair value above net income due to The classi/fication reduces mismatches in measurement or recognition that would otherwise arise as a result of di/fferent rules for measuring assets and liabilities.\n\n## 11-3. Derivatives\n\nAccounting for derivatives that are not a hedging instrument\n\nDerivatives that do not fall under the hedging criteria are classi/fied and measured at fair value over net income. The fair value of the derivatives is classi/fied respectively as an asset or as a liability, with changes in the fair value of the result.\n\nThe majority of the derivatives used in the management of the fund fall into this category.\n\nSome of the Group's insurance contracts contain embedded derivatives, such as interest rate guarantees. These insurance contracts do not comply with the IFRS 9 Financial Instruments accounting standard, but follow IFRS 17 Insurance contracts.\n\n## 11-4. Hedge accounting\n\n## Fair value hedging\n\nStorebrand uses fair value hedging for the interest rate risk. The items hedged are /financial liabilities measured at amortised cost. Derivatives are recognised at fair value through pro/fit or loss. Changes in the value of the hedged item that are attributable to the hedged risk adjust the carrying amount of the hedged item and are recognised through pro/fit or loss.\n\n## Hedging of net investments\n\nHedging of net investments in foreign businesses is recognised in the accounts in the same way as cash /flow hedging. Gains and losses on the hedging instrument that relate to the e/ffective part of the hedging are recognised through total comprehensive income, while gains and losses that relate to the ine/ffective part are recognised in the income statement. The total loss or gain in equity is recognised in the income statement when the foreign business is sold or wound up.\n\n## 11-5. Financial liabilities\n\nSubsequent to initial recognition, all /financial liabilities that are not derivatives are primarily measured at amortised cost using an e/ffective interest method.\n\n## 12. Insurance liabilities\n\nAn insurance contract is de/fined as a contract where Storebrand accepts signi/ficant insurance risk from a policyholder by agreeing to pay compensation to the policyholder if an insured event negatively a/ffects the policyholder. When classifying contracts, the company takes into account its material rights and obligations, regardless of whether they originate from a contract, a law or a regulation. Contracts that have the legal form of an insurance contract, but which do not expose the company to signi/ficant insurance risk, are classi/fied as investment contracts according to IFRS 9.\n\nAn insured event in IFRS 17 is a future event, which is covered by an insurance contract, which results in Storebrand having an obligation to pay compensation to a policyholder or its bene/ficiary. Examples of insurance events are death, disability, accidents, /fire and theft.",

Appendix\n\nInsurance contracts with collective disability pension consist of both a risk period, where the insurance event is becoming disabled, and a payment period, where the insurance event is continuing to be disabled and having a claim to continued disability pension payment. Storebrand has therefore assessed the coverage period to be long.\n\nLiability for remaining coverage (LRC): consists of the sum of the present value of cash /flows for future insurance payments and contractual service margin at the reporting date.\n\nLiability for incurred claims (LIC): consists of the present value of future cash /flows for incurred insurance events on the reporting date.\n\nStorebrand uses reinsurance to limit insurance risk. Reinsurance contracts are covered by IFRS 17, but since the reinsurance program is relatively limited in the Group, simpli/fied reporting has been chosen. The simpli/fication is not expected to have a major impact on the /financial statement.\n\nThe accounting principles for the most signi/ficant insurance obligations are explained below.\n\n## 12-1 Aggregation level for insurance contracts\n\nInsurance contracts are measured at group level. Groups of insurance contracts are determined by identifying portfolios of insurance contracts that include contracts that are subject to similar risks and are managed together. Storebrand identi/fies groups of insurance contracts by assessing the underlying insurance risk in the contracts and how changes in underlying assumptions a/ffect the contracts. Joint administration is also assessed on, among other things, how the business areas follow up the insurance contracts internally, the levels used when reporting to management and in risk management. Contracts within di/fferent product lines or issued by di/fferent group companies are expected to be included in di/fferent portfolios of contracts.\n\nIn addition, the standard prohibits the grouping of contracts issued more than one year apart in the same group, this entails requirements for further separation into annual cohorts based on the year of issue. In its adoption of IFRS 17, the EU has introduced an optional exemption from annual cohorts for directly participating contracts. This means that portfolios of participating insurance contracts are grouped based only on pro/fitability, regardless of year of issue. Storebrand has chosen to make use of the EU exemption from annual cohorts for contracts with direct participation.\n\n## 12-2 Cash /flows within the limits of a contract\n\nWhen measuring a group of insurance contracts, all future cash /flows within the limits of an existing insurance contract are included. Cash /flows fall within the limit of the insurance contract if they arise from material rights and obligations that exist in the reporting period when the company can force the policyholder to pay the premiums, or when the company has a signi/ficant obligation to provide insurance contract services to the policyholder. Such an obligation to provide insurance contract services ends when:\n\n- \u00b7  In practice, Storebrand has the opportunity to reassess the risks of the insurance contract concerned and can thus set a price or a performance level that fully re/flects these risks; or\n- \u00b7  In practice, Storebrand has the opportunity to set a price or performance level that fully re/flects the risk in the portfolio up to the time when the risks are reassessed and does not take into account the risks that apply to periods after the time of reassessment.\n\nFor guaranteed products, the contract's limits will usually include future premiums, as well as associated cash /flows for ful/filment. This is due to the fact that the group does not have the opportunity to reassess the policyholder's risk and thus cannot determine a new price or performance level that fully re/flects these risks. This applies both to the individual contract and at portfolio level. See more description in note 4.\n\nThe estimated cash /flows for a group of contracts include all receipts and payments directly related to the ful/filment of insurance contract services. This includes bene/fits and compensation to the policyholders, including among other things:\n\n- \u00b7   Premiums and any additional cash /flows resulting from these premiums.\n- \u00b7  Compensation and bene/fits to or on behalf of a policyholder.\n- \u00b7   Costs of processing compensation claims.\n- \u00b7   Costs for processing and maintaining policies.\n- \u00b7  Transfer and transfer of insurance contracts.\n- \u00b7  Transaction-based taxes and fees for SPP.\n- \u00b7  An allocation of /fixed and variable joint expenses that are directly attributable to the ful/filment of insurance contracts (for example expenses for accounting, HR, and IT). The allocation is done at group level using systematic and rational methods that are used consistently.\n\nIn addition, cash /flows arising from expenses for the sale, underwriting and establishment of a group of insurance contracts will be included when measuring an insurance contract. This applies to cash /flows that are directly attributable to the portfolio of insurance contracts to which the group belongs.",

Appendix\n\nThe costs are estimated based on the company's own cost analyzes and are based on the actual operating costs during the last year in SPP. In Storebrand Livsforsikring it is based on actual costs for the last two quarters and future estimated costs for two quarters. The projection of the expected future costs follows the same principles as the basis for Solvency II. Only immediate cost reductions are included in the calculation when estimating future costs.\n\nCosts related to claims reported under the PAA is done at the time the claim occurs. In cases where the contracts at the time of sale are de/fined as loss contracts, the loss is recognised immediately.\n\nAcquisition costs are cash /flows that arise from selling, underwriting and establishing insurance contracts and which can be directly attributed to the portfolio of insurance contracts to which the group belongs. Such contracts include cash /flows that cannot be directly attributed to individual contracts or groups of insurance contracts within the portfolio. For guaranteed pension contracts, acquisition costs are limited in Storebrand since guaranteed pensions are mainly a run-o/ff business with limited new sales. However, Storebrand has new business related to IF in SPP and participates in tenders within the public sector occupational pension market in Norway, disability and hybrid pension. It has been assessed that most acquisition costs are incurred just before or at the time of recognition.\n\n## Investment component\n\nStorebrand assesses the contract terms to determine whether there is an investment component. The amount that a policyholder can demand that Storebrand pay back to a policyholder under all circumstances, regardless of whether an insured event occurs, is classi/fied as non-distinct investment components. For collective pension contracts where the premium reserve accrues to 'a policyholder', Storebrand is obliged to pay back a current or future policyholder within the collective group of policyholders.\n\nAll contracts measured according to the variable fee approach have non-distinct investment components that Storebrand is obliged to pay back to current or future policyholders under all possible circumstances. Payments of this type are not de/fined as part of the insurance costs. The e/ffect of any deviations, changes in the expected pattern or timing of such repayments adjusts the CSM.\n\n## 12-3 Measurement\n\nIFRS 17 introduces a measurement model where the pro/fit is recognized in the pro/fit and loss over time as the company provides insurance-related services. The model is based on the present value of expected future cash /flows that are expected to occur when the company ful/fils contracts, an explicit risk adjustment for non-/financial risk and a contractual service margin (CSM).\n\nInsurance contracts are subject to di/fferent measurement method requirements based on whether the insurance contracts are classi/fied as directly participating contracts, which are measured according to the variable fee approach (VFA), or contracts without direct participation, which are measured according to the general measurement model (GMM). Storebrand determines whether a contract meets the de/finition of a directly participating contract when the contract is entered into. The contracts are not reclassi/fied unless the contract is modi/fied by changing the contract terms so that it no longer meets the conditions mentioned above.\n\nStorebrand issues a number of insurance contracts which are essentially investment-related service contracts where the company guarantees an investment return based on underlying items. These satisfy the de/finition of directly participating insurance contracts and comprise a large part of the Group's guaranteed products. Direct participating insurance contracts are measured according to the variable fee approach. Other insurance contracts have no elements of direct participation and are mainly measured according to the premium allocation approach (PAA), with the exception of collective disability pensions which follow the general measurement model due to the long coverage period.\n\nThe premium allocation approach is an optional, simpli/fied measurement model adapted to insurance and reinsurance contracts with a short coverage period of a maximum of one year. The coverage period is de/fined as the period when the company provides insurance contract services. This includes the insurance contract services that apply to all premiums within the limits of the contract. The premium allocation approach simpli/fies the measurement in that the liability for the remaining coverage period is based on premiums received, rather than the present value of expected future cash /flows for ful/filment.\n\nUnit link for Storebrand Livsforsikring and SPP is considered not to satisfy the de/finition of an insurance contract according to IFRS 17 because the insurance risk is considered to be immaterial. The contracts are accounted for according to IFRS 9 and are classi/fied as investment contracts in the balance sheet.\n\nThe following table shows the measurement model and method for transition per product category.",

The contractual service margin is systematically recognised in the income statement over the coverage period based on the pattern of transferred insurance contract services. Determining the release pattern is subject to a signi/ficant use of judgement and is determined by:\n\n- \u00b7  Identifying the coverage units (CU) in the Group based on the quantity of insurance contract services that are provided under the contracts in the Group and expected coverage period.\n- \u00b7  Allocating the contractual service margin to each coverage unit provided in the current period, and expected to be provided in the future.\n- \u00b7  Recognising in pro/fit or loss the amount allocated to coverage units provided in the period.\n\nThe coverage units are determined based on the expected duration associated with the group of insurance contracts. For the calculation of the coverage unit per group of insurance contracts, the policyholders' reserves are used as the basis for the assessment for Storebrand's insurance contracts, with the exception of the /first year for collective disability pension where the premium is used as a basis. For SPP, the policyholder's funds including deferred capital contribution (LKT latent capital contribution) are used as a basis for the assessment of coverage units.\n\nIf an insurance contracts' cash /flow is negative, Storebrand recognises a loss in the pro/fit and loss equivalent to the net out/flow for the group of onerous contracts. The determination of a loss component entails that the carrying value of the liability for the contract group is equal to the ful/filment cash /flows, and that the contract group's contractual service margin is equal to zero after the loss recognition.\n\nUpon subsequent measurement, the carrying value of a group of insurance contracts at the reporting date corresponds to the total sum of the liability for remaining coverage (LRC) and the liability for incurred claims (LIC). Liability for remaining coverage period corresponds to the present value of future ful/filment cash /flows that relate to future services and the remaining contractual service margin. The liability for incurred claims includes ful/filment cash /flows that relate to incurred claims, including events that have occurred but for which claims have not been reported, and other incurred insurance expenses.",

Appendix\n\nThe present value of expected future cash /flows is updated at the end of each period based on updated estimates of future cash /flows, discount rate and risk adjustment for non-/financial risk. The change in ful/filment cash /flows is recognised as follows for contracts measured using the variable fee approach:\n\n| Changes that relate to future services, such as changes in assumptions  relating to long life expectancy, disability and mortality.               | Adjusted in relation to contractual service margin   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|\n| Changes that relate to current or previous services, for example deviati- ons in estimates and events related to longevity, disability and death. | Adjusted in relation to contractual service margin   |\n| The entity's share of the e/ffects that result from the time value of money,  /financial risk and the e/ffect of these on the cash /flows.        | Adjusted in relation to contractual service margin   |\n\nIn the subsequent measurement, the contractual service margin is only adjusted for changes that apply to future services. This entails that changes in cash /flows for future services are recognised as pro/fit or loss as Storebrand provides services. At the end of each reporting period, the contractual service margin represents the pro/fit that is not recognised in the income statement as pro/fit or loss since it relates to future services.\n\nOne of the primary di/fferences between the variable fee approach and general measurement model is that when using the variable fee approach, the contractual service margin must be adjusted for the entity's share of any e/ffects resulting from market variables and their e/ffect on the cash /flows. The purpose of the adjustment is to reduce mismatch and volatility by recognising Storebrand's share of changes in the value of the underlying items in the contractual service margin.\n\nWhen applying general measurement model, the entity is not permitted to make such an adjustment. The change in ful/filment cash /flows is thereby recognised as follows for contracts measured using general measurement model:\n\n| Changes that relate to future services, such as changes in assumptions  relating to long life expectancy, disability and mortality.               | Adjusted in relation to contractual service margin     |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|\n| Changes that relate to current or previous services, for example deviati- ons in estimates and events related to longevity, disability and death. | Recognised in pro/fit and loss from insurance services |\n| The entity's share of the e/ffects that result from the time value of money,  /financial risk and the e/ffect of these on the cash /flows.        | Recognised as /financial insurance income or expenses  |\n\n## 12-5 Contracts measured according to the premium allocation approach\n\nUpon initial recognition of each group of insurance contracts, the carrying value of the liability for the remaining coverage period is measured as the total of premiums received as of the recognition date. Storebrand has chosen to recognise cash /flows for the acquisition of insurance costs in the income statement when these are incurred.\n\nIn the subsequent measurement, the carrying value of the liability for the remaining coverage period is increased by new premiums received and reduced by the share of premiums recognised for services provided. Insurance income for the period is equal to the amount of expected premium payments allocated to the period. The expected premium payments are allocated over each period based on the passage of time unless the expected pattern for release of risk during the coverage period di/ffers signi/ficantly from the passage of time. Since Storebrand provides insurance services within one year of receiving the premiums, there will be no need to adjust the liability for the remaining coverage period for the time value of money in accordance with IFRS 17.\n\nIf, at any time during the coverage period, facts and circumstances indicate that a group of insurance contracts is onerous, Storebrand recognises a loss in the income statement and correspondingly increase the liability for the remaining coverage period.\n\nStorebrand recognises a liability for incurred claims for claims that are incurred as of the reporting date, including damages that have occurred that are not known or fully processed by Storebrand. The cash /flows for incurred claims are adjusted for non-/financial risk (risk adjustment) and discounted using the current discount rate if cash /flows are expected to be paid out more than 12 months from the claim date.\n\nThe premium allocation approach applies correspondingly to reinsurance contracts, with some adjustments which re/flect that the reinsurance contracts entail that Storebrand has a net asset and that the risk adjustment is negative.",

Appendix\n\n## 12-6 Risk adjustment\n\nThe risk adjustment for non-/financial risk (RA) represents the compensation that Storebrand requires for bearing the uncertainty about the amount and timing of cash /flows that arise from non-/financial risk. The risks covered by the risk adjustment for non/financial risk are insurance risk and other non-/financial risks such as:\n\n- \u00b7   mortality\n- \u00b7  long life\n- \u00b7   disability/reactivation\n- \u00b7  P&C insurance risk\n- \u00b7  Lapse\n- \u00b7   expenses\n- \u00b7  catastrophe\n\nThe risk adjustment is calculated based on the cost of capital. This is similar to the risk margin under Solvency II with some adjustments, mainly excluding operational risk and counterparty risk. Storebrand is developing a partial internal model for /financial risk and life insurance risk. The life insurance risks include mortality, longevity, disability/reactivation and lapse risk. These are risks included in the risk adjustment, and the con/fidence level is calculated using the partial internal model, including a simpli/fied approach for risks not included in the partial internal model.\n\n## 12-7 Discount rate\n\nTo calculate a present value of future expected cash /flows, a discount rate must be de/fined that re/flects the time value of money and the /financial risks associated with those cash /flows. The discount curve is determined for the /first time at the transition date and then updated continuously at each reporting date. Storebrand has chosen to use a bottom-up approach for determining the discount rate, whereby a risk-free yield curve is used that is adjusted for liquidity premium to re/flect the liquidity characteristics of insurance contracts.\n\n## 13. Pension liabilities for own employees\n\nStorebrand has country-speci/fic pension schemes for its employees. The schemes are recognised in the accounts in accordance with IAS 19. In Norway, Storebrand has a de/fined-contribution pension. Storebrand is a member of the Norwegian contractual early retirement (AFP) pension scheme. The Norwegian AFP scheme is regarded as a de/fined-bene/fit scheme, but there is insu/fficient quantitative information to be able to estimate reliable accounting obligations and costs.\n\nIn Sweden, SPP has agreed, in accordance with the Finance Companies' Service Pension Plan (BTP Plan), to collective, de/fined-bene/fit pension plans for its employees. A group de/fined-bene/fit pension implies that an employee is guaranteed a certain pension based on the pay scale at the time of retirement on termination of the employment.\n\n## 13-1. De/fined-bene/fit scheme\n\nPension costs and pension obligations for de/fined-bene/fit pension schemes are determined using a linear accrual formula and expected /final salary as the basis for the entitlements, based on assumptions about the discount rate, future salary increases, pensions and National Insurance bene/fits, future returns on pension plan assets as well as actuarial estimates of mortality, disability and voluntary early leavers. The net pension cost for the period comprises the total of the accrued future pension entitlements during the period, the interest cost on the calculated pension liability and the calculated return on pension plan assets.\n\nActuarial gains and losses and the impact of changes in assumptions are recognised in total comprehensive income during the period in which they arise. Employees who resign before reaching retirement age or leave the scheme will be issued ordinary paid-up policies.\n\n## 13-2. De/fined-contribution scheme\n\nA de/fined-contribution pension scheme involves the Group in paying an annual contribution to the employees' collective pension savings. The future pension will depend upon the size of the contribution and the annual return on the pension savings. The Group does not have any further work-related obligations after the annual contribution has been paid. No provisions are made for ongoing pension liabilities for these types of schemes. De/fined-contribution pension schemes are recognised directly in the /financial statements.\n\n## 14. Tangible /fixed assets and intangible assets\n\nThe Group's tangible /fixed assets comprise /fixtures and /fittings, IT systems and properties used by the Group for its own activities.\n\nInventory and IT systems are valued at acquisition cost less accumulated depreciation and any write-downs.",

Appendix\n\nProperties used for the Group's own activities are measured at appreciated value less accumulated depreciation and write-downs. The fair value of these properties is tested annually in the same way as described for investment properties. The increase in value for buildings used by the Group for its own activities is recognised through total comprehensive income. Any write-down of the value of such a property is recognised /first in the revaluation reserve for increases in the value of the property in question. If the write-down exceeds the revaluation reserve for the property in question, the excess is expensed over the pro/fit and loss account.\n\nThe write-down period and method are reviewed annually to ensure that the method and period being used both correspond to the useful economic life of the asset. The disposal value is similarly reviewed. Properties are split into components if di/fferent parts have di/fferent useful economic lives. The depreciation period and method of depreciation are measured then separately for each component.\n\nThe value of a tangible /fixed asset is tested when there are indications that its value has been impaired. The impairment test is carried out for each asset if the asset primarily has independent, inward cash /flows, or possibly a larger cash-generating unit. Any impairment losses are charged to the income statement as the di/fference between the carrying value and the recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the greater of the fair value less costs of sale and the value in use.  On each reporting date it is determined as to whether there is a basis for reversing previous impairment losses on non-/financial assets.\n\n## 15. Tax\n\nThe Group's tax liabilities are valued in accordance with IAS 12 and clari/fications in IFRIC 23.\n\nThe tax cost in the income statement consists of tax payable and changes in deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the income statement, except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in total comprehensive income. Deferred tax and deferred tax assets are calculated on the di/fferences between accounting and tax values of assets and liabilities.\n\nDeferred tax is calculated on the basis of the Group's tax loss carryforward, deductible temporary di/fferences and taxable temporary di/fferences.\n\nAny deferred tax assets shall be recognised if it is considered probable that the tax asset will be recovered. Assets and liabilities associated with deferred tax are recognised as a net amount when there is a legal right to o/ffset assets and liabilities for tax payable and the Group has the ability and intention to settle net tax payable.\n\nChanges in assets and liabilities associated with deferred tax that are due to changes in the tax rate are generally recognised in the income statement.\n\nReference is made to Note 26 - Tax for further information.\n\n## 16. Provision for dividends\n\nThe proposed dividend is classi/fied as equity until approved by the general meeting and presented as liabilities after this date. The proposed dividend is not included in the calculation of the solvency capital.\n\n## 17. Leases\n\nLeases are recognised in the balance sheet. The present value of the combined lease payments shall be recognised on the balance sheet as debt and an asset that re/flects the right of use of the asset during the lease period. Storebrand has chosen to classify the right to use the asset as tangible /fixed assets and the lease liability as other debt. The recognised asset is amortised over the lease period and the depreciation expense is recognised as an operating expense on an ongoing basis. The interest expense on the lease liability is recognised as a /financial expense. Leases with a duration of less than 12 months and leases that include assets valued at less than approximately NOK 50,000 will not be recognised in the balance sheet, but rental amounts will be recognised as an operating expense over the lease period.\n\n## 18. Statement of cash /flows\n\nThe statement of cash /flows is prepared using the direct method and shows cash /flows grouped by sources and use. Cash is de/fined as cash, receivables from central banks and receivables from credit institutions with no agreed period of notice.",

Ap/fiendix\n\n## Note 2:  Critical accounting estimates and judgements\n\nIn preparing the consolidated /financial statements the management are required to apply estimates, make discretionary assessments and apply assumptions for uncertain amounts. The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis and are based on historical experience and expectations of future events and represent the management's best judgement at the time the /financial statements were prepared.\n\nA description of the most important elements and assessments in which discretion is used and which may in/fluence recognised amounts or key /figures is provided below and in Note 13 for Solvency II and in Note 26 for Tax.\n\nActual results may di/ffer from these estimates.\n\n## Macroeconomic situation\n\nStorebrand is a/ffected by uncertainty associated with the macroeconomic situation that has arisen in the wake of the pandemic and geopolitical turmoil. Increased economic instability leads to increased in/flation and negatively a/ffects both the level of costs and the percentage of claims. Storebrand follows the macroeconomic situation closely and will implement measures where necessary.\n\nIn/flation and /financial instability have continued to increase through 2023 and global GDP growth expectations have been sharply downgraded throughout the year. The predicted interest rates of both the central banks and the markets have consistently been too low compared to the actual development and an interest rate plateau is now expected rather than an interest rate peak as /first assumed. Although in/flation is declining as a result of the labour market and wage growth having weakened, rising oil prices have kept in/flation above the central banks' in/flation target. It is expected that the central banks will keep a close eye on in/flation going forward and that the time for cuts in interest rate is further away than /first expected. For Storebrand, the increased interest rate has a positive e/ffect on the Group's /financial results due to higher return on the Group's funds. Furthermore, an increased interest rate contributes positively to the guaranteed pension as the current interest rate exceeds the guaranteed return.\n\n## Insurance Contracts\n\n## 2-1 De/finitions and classi/fication\n\nIFRS 17 requires substantial use of judgment and estimates during the classi/fication, recognition and measurement of insurance contracts. Areas that require signi/ficant use of judgment and estimates include:\n\n- \u00b7  Estimation of cash /flows for ful/fillment\n- \u00b7  Determination of the discount rate\n- \u00b7  Determination of risk adjustment for non-/financial risk\n- \u00b7  Identi/fication of the coverage units in a group of insurance contracts and determination of the pattern of recognition of CSM over the coverage period based on the services provided\n\n## Signi/ficant insurance risk\n\nStorebrand uses judgement to assess the signi/ficance of insurance risks. The assessment is made upon initial recognition on a contract-by-contract basis. When classifying contracts according to IFRS 17, Storebrand takes into account its rights and obligations, regardless of whether these originate from a contract, a law or a regulation. Storebrand assesses possible elements with commercial substance that may have an impact on insurance risk, including events that are extremely unlikely.\n\n## 2-2 Methods and assumptions used to measure insurance contracts:\n\nPension products with guarantees are modeled stochastically to estimate the customer's value of the guarantee and distribution of pro/fits, while other products are modeled deterministically. The estimates of future cash /flows re/flect the Group's best estimates given the current conditions on the reporting date and take into account any relevant market variables in accordance with observable market data.\n\n## Costs\n\nThe estimated future costs that can be directly attributed to the existing insurance contracts are included in the reporting. The costs are estimated according to the Group's own cost analyses and are based on the current level of operating costs in recent periods, combined with assumptions about future in/flation and salary development that re/flect the Group's best estimate. Only immediate cost reductions are considered when estimating future costs.\n\nThe cash /flows within the contract limit include the allocation of both /fixed and variable indirect costs directly attributable to the ful/filment of insurance contracts. To re/flect such indirect costs, Storebrand uses systematic and rational allocation methods that re/flect the products that drive the costs. The allocation method is used consistently for cost categories that share similar characteristics.",

Ap/fiendix\n\n## Biometric prerequisites\n\nContracts measured according to the general measurement model and the variable fee approach include biometric risks such as life expectancy, mortality and disability. This means that an important source of estimate uncertainty when calculating the future cash /flows for the contracts is linked to assumptions and estimates about biometric risks.\n\nStorebrand uses widely recognized actuarial models when determining the best estimate assumptions related to biometric risks. When estimating biometric risks, the Group takes measures to re/flect recent historical data and the characteristics of the underlying populations, including gender, age, disability and other relevant information related to the policies. The conditions for best estimate used under IFRS 17 are in accordance with those used under Solvency II.\n\nUnfavorable developments in biometric risks can lead to a reduction in the insurance service result or the contractual service margin. Storebrand's exposure to biometric risk is limited by the risk equalization fund, for products included in the risk equalization fund.\n\n## Lapse probabilities\n\nLapse probabilities are determined using statistical modeling based on the Group's own observations. They vary with product category and external market conditions. For large parts of the guaranteed pension segment, the lapse probabilities are assumed to be close to zero percent. This is due to an inactive transfer market for de/fined bene/fit contracts, including paid-up policies, in a low interest rate environment in recent years. Changes in the expected lapse probabilities mainly a/ffect the contractual service margin.\n\n## Yield assumptions\n\nStorebrand uses stochastic modeling to project the asset return for all contracts that are measured according to the variable fee approach or the general measurement model. In the modelling, the Group generates a number of potential /financial scenarios based on a probability distribution that re/flects the investment strategy and other relevant market variables. The random variations are therefore based on the volatility of each asset portfolio, in which the relevant insurance contracts are invested.\n\n## Discount rates\n\nStorebrand uses a discount rate where the risk-free interest rate curve is adjusted with a liquidity premium to re/flect the liquidity of the insurance contracts. The most important sources of estimate uncertainty are the estimation of the discount rate beyond the observable data points for interest rate swaps in Norway and Sweden, as well as the adjustment for any credit risk in the underlying reference interest rates. Storebrand manages the uncertainty by using well-established methods established by EIOPA to determine the forward rate and the credit risk adjustment. The method maximizes the use of observable market variables and ensures that the estimates re/flect current market conditions and other available information. Other sources of estimate uncertainty are linked to the estimation of the liquidity in the insurance contracts and the underlying /financial instruments.\n\nThe discount rates used to discount the estimated future cash /flows are given below:\n\n| 31. 12.2023   | 1 year   | 5 years   | 10 years   | 15 years   | 20 years   |\n|---------------|----------|-----------|------------|------------|------------|\n| NOK           | 4.26 %   | 3.58 %    | 3.49 %     | 3.50 %     | 3.50 %     |\n| SEK           | 3.05 %   | 2.28 %    | 2.27 %     | 2.56 %     | 2.77 %     |\n\nBased on an updated assessment of the product's characteristics, Storebrand has changed the discount rate for some of the company's insurance liabilities which are measured under the premium allocation approach. The contracts were originally discounted with a /fixed discount rate, but Storebrand considers that a discount rate as described in the section above better re/flects the time value of the insurance liabilities. The change in the discount rate is in accordance with IAS 8.34 and has been applied prospectively.\n\n## Risk adjustment for non-/financial risk\n\nThe risk adjustment is calculated based on the cost-of-capital method. The basis for the calculation is the capital charge under Solvency II standard model for the relevant risks for the entire coverage period and a cost of capital of 6 percent p.a., discounted by the discount rate. This shares similarities with the risk margin under Solvency II, but with some adjustments which primarily are the exclusion of operational risk and counterparty risk.\n\nThe corresponding con/fidence level is based on the distribution of the one-year value at risk for the solvency capital due to losses from the included risks. The risk calibration is based on Storebrand's partial internal model which is under development and the methodology is supported by Moody's report 'Equivalent Con/fidence Level For the IFRS 17 Risk Adjustment'. The con/fidence level is >95 percent.",

Ap/fiendix\n\n## Amortization of the contractual service margin\n\nStorebrand applies judgement to identify the quantity of bene/fits provided in a group of insurance contracts and allocate the contractual service margin based on coverage units. The coverage units are determined based on the expected duration linked to the group of insurance contracts. For guaranteed pension contracts with an annual return guarantee, coverage units must re/flect both insurance-related and investment-related service, both in the deferral and payment periods. Since the contractual service margin represent the discounted value of the owner's expected future earnings, the number of coverage units is also discounted. The annual share of the contractual service margin that is recognized as income is determined as the year's number of coverage units divided by the discounted value of coverage units over the life of the contract. This is used consistently over time and across contracts that share similar characteristics:\n\nContracts with direct participation (VFA): Storebrand Livsforsikring uses the policyholder's reserves as a basis for determining the level of bene/fits provided when calculating the coverage unit per group of insurance contracts measured under the variable fee approach. For SPP, policyholder funds, including the deferred capital contribution (DCC), are used as a basis for the assessment of coverage unit. This insures a relatively stable amortization and serves as a scaling factor for variable fee approach contracts providing both insurance coverage and investment-related services.\n\nNon-participating contracts (GMM): For group disability insurance in Norway, Storebrand uses insurance premiums as a basis to determine the quantity of bene/fits during the /first coverage year (accumulation phase), as opposed to the policyholder reserves during the pay-out phase. At the end of each reporting period, the total coverage units are reassessed to re/flect the expected pattern of service, contract cancellations and lapse when applicable.\n\nFor contracts measured under the variable fee approach, Storebrand makes further adjustments to the coverage units to ensure that the contractual service margin release re/flects the insurance services provided in the reporting period. These adjustments are made to account for the fact that the expected /financial return on average exceeds the discount rate used to project future assets under IFRS 17. The adjustment does not a/ffect the size of the contractual service margin, but prevents an arti/ficial delay in income from expected excess returns. In stochastic scenarios where the risk-free interest rate is below the annual return guarantee, the expected risk premium (partially) covers the lack of return (and thus the expected loss for Storebrand), while in good scenarios where the risk-free interest rate is above the annual guarantee, the expected excess return is shared with the customer in the form of pro/fit sharing. Prerequisites for returns in excess of the risk-free interest rate are determined by expected risk premiums for each asset class. These are updated quarterly and are based as much as possible on observable market data, both current data and historical data. Examples of this are credit spreads for various types of bonds and pricing data for relevant stock indices. For assets with less available market data and more company-speci/fic expected returns, e.g. investment property, the risk premiums are also partly estimated based on data for Storebrand's actual investments. Alternative and simpler methods for calculating income from excess returns have been tested, including adjusting the discounting of coverage units, without su/fficient precision being achieved.\n\nFurther information on insurance contract liabilities is given in notes 7, 37 and 38.\n\n## Investment properties\n\nInvestment properties are measured at fair value. The commercial real estate market in Norway and Sweden is not very liquid, nor is it transparent. There is uncertainty related to the valuations, and it requires the management to apply assumptions and use of  judgement, especially in periods with turbulent /financial markets.\n\nKey elements included in valuations that require use of judgement are:\n\n- \u00b7  Market rent and vacancy trends\n- \u00b7  Quality and duration of rental income\n- \u00b7  Owners' costs\n- \u00b7  Technical standard and any need for upgrading\n- \u00b7  Discount rates for both certain and uncertain cash /flows, as well as residual value\n\nExternal valuations are also obtained for parts of the portfolio every quarter. All properties must have a minimum of one external valuation during a 3 year period.\n\nReference is also made to Notes 7 and 12 in which the valuation of investment properties at fair value is described in more detail.",

Ap/fiendix\n\n## Financial instruments at fair value\n\nThere will be uncertainty associated with the pricing of /financial instruments, particularly instruments that are not priced in an active market. This applies in particular for the types of securities priced on the basis of non-observable assumptions. For these investments, various valuation techniques are applied to determine fair value. This include private equity investments, investment properties, and other /financial instruments where theoretical models are used in pricing. Any changes to the assumptions could a/ffect recognised amounts. The majority of such /financial instruments are included in the customer portfolio.\n\nThere is uncertainty linked to the valuation of /fixed-rate loans that are classi/fied at fair value due to variation in the interest rate terms o/ffered by banks and since there will often be di/fferent credit risks associated with the individual borrowers.\n\nReference is also made to note 12, in which the valuation of /financial instruments at fair value is described in more detail.\n\n## Management fee\n\nIn April 2021, the Norwegian Financial Supervisory Authority sent an identical letter to all life insurance companies and pension funds in which the Norwegian Financial Supervisory Authority assessed that the management fee to management companies for mutual funds and managers of alternative investment funds should be included in the companies' price tari/ff. The statement only applied to pension bene/fit schemes. A collective industry, including Storebrand, asked the Ministry of Finance to review the Norwegian Financial Supervisory Authority's interpretation. In a letter dated 9 January 2023, the Ministry of Finance has stated that there is insu/fficient legal basis to require the pension funds to include such management remuneration in the price tari/ffs, thereby giving the industry support in its interpretation.\n\nThe Ministry of Finance further states that in order to ensure a uniform practice in the industry, a clari/fication should be made of how such management fees are to be treated. The ministry assumes that such a clari/fication should take place through an amendment to the law or regulations. The Ministry of Finance has asked the Financial Supervisory Authority to prepare a draft of a consultation note on how management fees for investment in funds of customer funds that are part of the collective portfolio should be treated in accordance with the rules on price tari/ffs and pro/fits.\n\n## Deferred tax and uncertain tax positions\n\nCalculation of deferred tax assets, deferred tax liabilities and the income tax expense is based on the interpretation of rules and estimates.\n\nThe Group's business activities may give rise to disputes etc. related to tax positions with an uncertain outcome. The Group makes provisions for uncertain and disputed tax positions with best estimates of expected amounts, subject to decisions by the tax authorities in accordance with IAS 12 and IFRIC 23. The provisions are reversed if the disputed tax position is decided to the bene/fit of the Group.\n\nReference is made to further information in Note 26.",

Ap/fiendix\n\n## Reconciliation between income statement and cash equivalent earnings (alternative income setup)\n\nThe alternative list of results is based on the legal entities' statutory accounts in the group, adjusted for intercompany transactions. IFRS uses IFRS with the exception of IFRS 17 for Storebrand Livsforsikring AS and SPP Pension &; Fors\u00e4kring AB, where the local accounting principles are in accordance with the business rules. Since the alternative income statement is based on the legal entities' statutory /financial statements, the group adjustments related to amortization and tax e/ffects on acquired operations are not included in the alternative income statement. The results in the segments are reconciled with the statutory income statement for each legal entity in the Group.\n\nStorebrand has communicated that it will continue to report its alternative income statement following the implementation of IFRS 17 in the consolidated /financial statements, as this cash-equivalent reporting provides useful information about value creation in the business and which are the pro/fit elements for which the Group has performance targets and follow-up.\n\nIn an alternative pro/fit and loss setup, the insurance obligations in Storebrand Livsforsikring are discounted by a guaranteed interest rate, while for SPP Pension & Fors\u00e4kring the prevailing discount rate is determined on the basis of the methods underlying the discount rate in Solvency II.\n\nA signi/ficant proportion of Norwegian insurance contracts have one-year interest rate guarantees, so the guaranteed return must be achieved every year. In the Swedish operations, there are no contracts with an annual interest rate guarantee, but there are insurance contracts with a /final value guarantee.\n\nThe following is an overall description of the content of the individual reporting lines in the alternate performance setup:\n\nFee and administrative income consists of fees and /fixed administrative income. Storebrand Life Insurance charges a fee for interest rate guarantee and pro/fit risk. The interest rate guarantees in group pension insurance with interest rate guarantees must be priced in advance. The level of the interest rate guarantee, the size of the bu/ffer capital (additional reserves and market value adjustment reserve) and the investment risk in the portfolio in which the pension funds are invested determine the fee the client pays for the interest rate guarantee.\n\nThere are also fees for asset management, net interest income from banking, and other management fees for both savings and guaranteed products.\n\nThe insurance result consists of insurance premiums and claims.\n\nInsurance premiums consist of earned premiums related to risk products (insurance segment).\n\nClaims consists of claims paid and changes in provisions for IBNR and RBNS related to risk products.\n\nAdministrative expenses consist of the Group's operating expenses  in the Group's income statement minus operating expenses allocated to traditional individual products with pro/fit sharing.\n\nFinancial items and risk performance, life and pension include risk performance, life and pension and /financial results including net pro/fit sharing and loan losses.\n\nRisk performance life and pension consists of the di/fference between risk premium and claims for products related to de/fined contribution pensions, fund insurance contracts (savings segment) and de/fined bene/fit pensions (guaranteed pension segment).\n\nThe /financial result consists of a return on the company portfolios Storebrand  ASA, Storebrand Livsforsikring AS and SPP Pension & F\u00f6rs\u00e4kring AB (Other segment), while the return on the group's other company portfolios is a /financial result within the segment to which the business is linked. The /financial result also includes return on customer assets related to products in the insurance segment.",

Ap/fiendix\n\n## Net pro/fit sharing\n\n## Storebrand Livsforsikring AS\n\nA modi/fied pro/fit-sharing scheme was introduced for old and new individual contracts that have abandoned group pension insurance (paid-up policies), so that the company can retain up to 20 per cent of the pro/fits from the return after any provision for additional statutory reserves. The modi/fied pro/fit-sharing model means that any negative risk result can be deducted from customers' interest pro/fits before sharing, if it is not covered by the risk equalization fund. Individual capital insurance and pensions written by the Group before 1 January 2008 will continue to apply the pro/fit and loss rules applicable before 2008. No new contracts can be established in this portfolio. The Group may retain up to 35 per cent of its total comprehensive income after provisions for additional statutory reserves. Any negative return on customer portfolios and a return lower than the interest rate guarantee, which cannot be covered by additional statutory reserves/ bu/ffer reserves, must be covered by the company's equity and included in the line for net pro/fit sharing and losses.\n\n## SPP Pension & F\u00f6rs\u00e4kring AB\n\nFor premiums paid from 2016 onwards, previous pro/fit sharing is replaced by a guarantee fee for premium-determined insurance (IF portfolio). The guarantee fee is annual and is calculated as 0.2 percent of the capital. This goes to the company. For deposits agreed before 2016, pro/fit sharing is maintained, i.e. if the total return on assets in one calendar year for a premium-determined insurance policy (IF portfolio) exceeds the guaranteed interest rate, pro/fit sharing will be triggered. When pro/fit sharing is triggered, 90 percent of the total return on assets goes to the policyholder and 10 percent to the company. The company's share of the total return on assets is included in the /financial result. For performance insurance (KF portfolio), the company has the right to charge indexation fees if the group pro/fit allows indexation of the insurance. It is permissible to index up to a maximum corresponding to the change in the consumer price index (CPI) between the two previous September. Pensions paid are indexed if the ratio of assets to guaranteed insurance liabilities in the portfolio as of 30 September exceeds 107 percent, and half of the fee is charged. The entire fee will be charged if the ratio of assets to guaranteed insurance liabilities in the portfolio as of 30 September exceeds 120 percent, in which case paid-up policies can also be recognized. The total fee corresponds to 0.8 per cent of the insurance capital. The guaranteed liability is monitored continuously. If the guaranteed liability is higher than the value of the assets, provisions must be made in the form of deferred capital contributions. If the assets are lower than the guarantee obligation when the insurance payments start, the company adds capital up to the guarantee obligation in the form of a realised capital contribution. Changes in deferred capital contributions are included in the /financial result.\n\nLoan losses consist of individual and group write-downs of lending activities recognised on the balance sheet in the Storebrand Bank Group.\n\nAmortisation of intangible assets includes depreciation and possible write-downs of intangible assets established through acquisitions of enterprises where the acquired entity has subsequently merged with the acquiring entity.\n\n|                                                | Savings                               | Savings                               | Insurance                             | Insurance                             | Guaranteed pension   | Guaranteed pension   |\n|------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|\n| NOK million                                    | 2023                                  | 2022                                  | 2023                                  | 2022                                  | 2023                 | 2022                 |\n| Fee and administation income                   | 5,443                                 | 4,733                                 |                                       |                                       | 1,600                | 1,597                |\n| Insurance result                               |                                       |                                       | 1,122                                 | 1,664                                 |                      |                      |\n| - Insurance premiums f.o.a.                    |                                       |                                       | 6,908                                 | 6,088                                 |                      |                      |\n| - Claims f.o.a.                                |                                       |                                       | -5,787                                | -4,424                                |                      |                      |\n| Operating cost                                 | -3,582                                | -3,031                                | -1,251                                | -1,112                                | -822                 | -850                 |\n| Cash equivalent earnings from operations       | 1,861                                 | 1,701                                 | -129                                  | 552                                   | 778                  | 747                  |\n| Financial items and risk result life & pension | 1                                     | -49                                   | 155                                   | 43                                    | 547                  | 157                  |\n| Cash equivalent earnings before amortisa- tion | 1,862                                 | 1,653                                 | 27                                    | 596                                   | 1,326                | 903                  |\n| Amortisation of intangible assets  1)          | Amortisation of intangible assets  1) | Amortisation of intangible assets  1) | Amortisation of intangible assets  1) | Amortisation of intangible assets  1) |                      |                      |\n| Cash equivalent earnings before tax            | Cash equivalent earnings before tax   | Cash equivalent earnings before tax   | Cash equivalent earnings before tax   | Cash equivalent earnings before tax   |                      |                      |",

Ap/fiendix\n\n## Organisation of risk management\n\nThe Group's organisation of the responsibility for risk management follows a model based on three lines of defence. The objective of the model is to safeguard the responsibility for risk management at both company and Group level.\n\nBoard of Directors\n\nCEO\n\nExecutive management\n\nRisk management\n\nCRO Group Independent control functions\n\nCompliance\n\nActuary function\n\nAnti-money laundering (AML)\n\nPrivacy (DPO)\n\nInformation Security (CISO)\n\nThe boards of directors of both Storebrand ASA and the group companies have the overall responsibility for limiting and following up the risks associated with the activities. The boards set annual limits and guidelines for risk-taking in the company, receive reports on the actual risk levels, and perform a forward-looking assessment of the risk situation.\n\nThe Board of Storebrand ASA has established a Risk Committee consisting of 4 Board members. The main task of the Risk Committee is to prepare matters to be considered by the Board in the area of risk, with a special focus on the Group's appetite for risk, risk strategy and investment strategy. The Committee should contribute forward-looking, decision-making support related to the Board's discussion of risk taking, /financial forecasts and the treatment of risk reporting.\n\nManagers at all levels in the company are responsible for risk management within their own area of responsibility.  Good risk management requires targeted work on objectives, strategies and action plans, identi/fication and assessment of risks, documentation of processes and routines, prioritisation and implementation of improvement measures, and good communication, information and reporting.\n\n## Independent control functions\n\nIndependent control functions have been established for risk management for the business (Risk Management Function/ Chief Risk O/fficer), for compliance with the regulations (Compliance Function), for ensuring the insurance liabilities are calculated correctly (Actuary Function) for data protection (Data Protection O/fficer), for information security (CISO), for money laundering (Anti Money Laundering) and for the bank's lending. Relevant functions have been established for both the Storebrand Group (the Group) and all of the companies requiring a licence. The independent control functions are organised directly under the companies' managing directors and report to the respective company's board.\n\nIn terms of function, the independent control functions are a/ffiliated with Governance Risk & Compliance (GRC). GRC is a knowledge community headed by the Group CRO. The Group CRO is responsible to the Group CEO and reports to the Board of Storebrand ASA. GRC's task is to ensure that all signi/ficant risks are identi/fied, measured and appropriately reported. The GRC function shall be actively involved in the development of the Group's risk strategy and maintain a holistic view of the company's risk exposure. This includes responsibility for ensuring compliance with the relevant regulations for risk management and the consolidated companies' operations.\n\nThe internal audit function is organised directly under the Board and shall provide the boards of the relevant consolidated companies with con/firmation concerning the appropriateness and e/ffectiveness of the company's risk management, including how well the various lines of defence are working.\n\n## Note 6: Operational risk\n\nOperational risk is the risk of /financial loss, damaged reputation or sanctions related to violations of internal or external regulations as a result of ine/ffective, insu/fficient or defective internal processes or systems, human error, external events or rules and guidelines not being followed.\n\nThe purpose of operational risk management is to avoid operational incidents that impact customers, result in serious operational disruptions, violations of regulations and/or direct /financial loss.\n\nInternal auditing",

Ap/fiendix\n\nThe Group seeks to reduce operational risk through an e/ffective system for internal control. Risks are followed up through the management's risk reviews, with documentation of risks, measures and the follow-up of incidents. In addition, Internal Audit carries out independent checks through audit projects adopted by the Board.\n\nContingency and continuity plans have been prepared to deal with serious incidents in business-critical processes.\n\nCyber risk is becoming an increasingly important operational risk. The threat picture for cybercrime is characterised by organised crime and increased geopolitical sentiment. Technology advances enable the spread and increased automation of fraud, and an increasing targeting of cyberattacks.\n\nOur ability to manage cyber risk depends on good and proactive digital resilience. This entails a comprehensive security strategy, good plans for crisis management and continuity for our critical business processes, as well as training and practice on relevant scenarios. This helps to reduce risk and increase the likelihood of good handling of undesirable incidents.\n\nThe asset management business has a modern and standardised core system, combined with self-developed applications. The bank platform and insurance platform are based on purchased standard systems that are operated and monitored through outsourcing agreements. There is a greater degree of own development for the life insurance activities, while parts of the operation of this have also been outsourced. The unit administration within de/fined-contribution occupational pension and unit linked products is managed in a purchased system solution.\n\nStable and secure technology and infrastructure are vital to the business and for reliable /financial reporting. Errors and disruptions may impact both customer and shareholder trust. In a phase of the transition to cloud-based technology services, greater attention is being paid to the complexity and integrations in existing solutions. Cloud-based services and infrastructure have good inbuilt security solutions and reduce the risk associated with self-developed systems and, in the long term, outdated infrastructure. For those parts of the technology services that have been outsourced, risk-based follow-up of providers has been established with the aim of managing the risk associated with the IT systems' development, management, operation and information security.\n\n## Note 7: Financial market risks and insurance risk\n\nThe consolidated /financial statements for Storebrand Livsforsikring AS and Storebrand ASA have been prepared in accordance with IFRS Accounting Standards as determined by the EU. From 2023, new accounting standards apply for /financial instruments (IFRS 9) and insurance contracts (IFRS 17). The /financial statements for Storebrand Livsforsikring AS (Storebrand Livsforsikring) are still prepared in accordance with Norwegian accounting principles, consistent with the customer accounts. The /financial statements for SPP Pension & F\u00f6rs\u00e4kring AB (SPP) are still prepared in accordance with Swedish accounting principles.\n\nThe risk management of the investments is still aimed at managing the risk based on the customer accounts and GAAP company accounts for Storebrand Livsforsikring and SPP. The description of /financial market risk below mainly re/flects the risk measured by these principles.\n\nThe new IFRS standards change the dynamics of the Group results. The e/ffect of changes in the /financial market for the IFRS result is reported below under Sensitivities.\n\n## Financial market risk\n\nFinancial market risk means changes in the value of assets as a result of unexpected volatility or price changes in the /financial markets. It also includes the risk that the value of the insurance contract liability develops di/fferently from the assets as a result of changes in interest rates. The most important market risks are interest rate risk, stock market risk, property price risk, credit risk and exchange rate risk.\n\nThe /financial assets are invested in a number of sub-portfolios. Market risk a/ffects Storebrand's income and pro/fit differently in the various portfolios. There are three main types of sub-portfolios: company portfolios, customer portfolios without guarantee (unit linked insurance) and customer portfolios with guarantee.\n\nThe market risk in the company portfolios has a direct impact on the result. Storebrand's aim is to take low /financial risk for the company portfolios, and the funds are invested in short- and medium-term interest-bearing securities with low credit risk.\n\nThe market risk in unit linked insurance is borne by the customers, which means that Storebrand is not directly a/ffected by changes in value. Changes in value nevertheless a/ffect Storebrand's result indirectly. The income is mainly based on the size of the portfolios, while the costs are usually /fixed. A lower return from the /financial market than expected will therefore have a negative e/ffect on Storebrand's income and result.",

Ap/fiendix\n\nFor customer portfolios with a guarantee, the net risk for Storebrand will be lower than the gross market risk. The extent of risk sharing with customers depends on several factors, the most important of which is the size and /flexibility of the customer bu/ffers, as well as the level and duration of the interest rate guarantee. If the return is not high enough to meet the guaranteed interest, de/ficits will be covered by using customer bu/ffers in the form of risk capital built up from previous years' pro/fits. The bu/ffers consist of exchange rate adjustment funds, additional provisions and conditional bonus. Storebrand is responsible for covering any de/ficiencies that cannot be covered by the customer's bu/ffers.\n\nThe risk is a/ffected by changes in the interest rate level. Rising interest rates are negative in the short term because the resulting drop in value on bonds and interest rate swaps reduces investment returns and bu/ffers. But in the long term, higher interest rates are positive because of the higher probability of achieving a return above the guarantee.\n\nFor guaranteed customer portfolios and the company portfolio for Storebrand Livsforsikring AS, most bonds are valued at amortized cost. It dampens the e/ffect of interest rate changes on the book return. The valuation at amortized cost in the accounts is now higher than fair value. For SPP, both investments and debt are assessed at fair value. Because SPP has fairly similar interest rate sensitivity on assets and liabilities, interest rate changes have a limited net e/ffect on SPP's /financial result under Swedish GAAP.\n\nFor the consolidated /financial statements for Storebrand Livsforsikring AS and Storebrand ASA, all bonds are assessed at fair value. The value of these investments is negatively a/ffected by rising interest rates and positively a/ffected by falling interest rates. For the consolidated accounts, the value of the insurance liabilities is also interest-sensitive, with a value that moves in the opposite direction to the investments. This reduces the risk, but the net risk is falling interest rates.\n\nThere is an increased risk associated with the valuation of /financial instruments. This results in greater uncertainty than normal relating to the pricing of /financial instruments that are valued based on models, and it must be assumed that for illiquid assets there is a di/fference between the estimated value and the price achieved when sold in the market. Valuations related to investment properties are considered to have particularly increased uncertainty due to macroeconomic developments, and the overall transaction volume for investment properties was signi/ficantly lower in 2022 and 2023 than normal. Furthermore, the valuation of investment properties is sensitive to changes in assumptions such as in/flation and interest rates. There is a wide range of possible outcomes for these assumptions and thus for the modeled valuations. The values therefore re/flect the management's best estimate, but contain greater uncertainty than would be the case in a normal year.\n\nFinancial assets and liabilities in foreign currencies\n\n|                              | Balance sheet items  excluding currency  derivatives   | Forwad contracts   | Net position 2023   |          | Net position  2022   |\n|------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|---------------------|----------|----------------------|\n| NOK million                  | Net in balance sheet                                   | Net sales          | in currency         | in NOK   | in NOK               |\n| DKK                          | 263                                                    | -295               | -32                 | -48      | -174                 |\n| CHF                          | 83                                                     | -106               | -23                 | -278     | -400                 |\n| HKD                          | 185                                                    | -516               | -331                | -430     | -544                 |\n| CAD                          | 191                                                    | -401               | -210                | -1,615   | -1,835               |\n| EUR                          | 2,068                                                  | -1,477             | 591                 | 6,635    | 2,630                |\n| GBP                          | 117                                                    | -286               | -169                | -2,190   | -2,488               |\n| JPY                          | 355                                                    | -704               | -349                | -2,516   | -2,497               |\n| SEK                          | 259,071                                                | -13,849            | 245,222             | 247,116  | 221,747              |\n| USD                          | 4,400                                                  | -6,341             | -1,941              | -19,714  | -27,041              |\n| NOK 1)                       | 83,734                                                 | -425               | 83,309              | 83,309   | 65,252               |\n| Other currency types         |                                                        |                    |                     | -480     | -409                 |\n| Insurance liabilities in SEK |                                                        |                    |                     | -257,831 | -227,271             |\n| Total net currency positions |                                                        |                    |                     | 51,958   | 26,971               |\n\n1) Equity and bond funds denominated in NOK with foreign currency exposurein i.a.

Appendix\n\n## Storebrand Life Insurance:\n\nThe company hedges most of the foreign exchange risk in the customer portfolios on an ongoing basis. Foreign exchange risk exists primarily as a result of investments in international securities, as well as subordinated loans in a foreign currency to a certain extent. Hedging is performed by means of forward foreign exchange contracts at the portfolio level, and the currency positions are monitored continuously against a total limit. Negative currency positions are closed out no later than the day after they arose. In addition, separate limits have been de/fined so that active currency positions can be taken. Storebrand uses a principle for currency hedging called block hedging, which strealines the implementation of currency hedging.\n\n## SPP:\n\nSPP uses currency hedging for its investments to a certain degree. Currency exposure may be between 0 and 30 per cent in accordance with the investment strategy.\n\n## Banking business:\n\nStorebrand Bank ASA hedges net balance sheet items by means of forward contracts. The permitted limit for the bank's foreign exchange position is 0.50 per cent of primary capital, which is approximately 12 million at present.\n\n## Insurance risk\n\nInsurance risk is the risk arising from the uncertainty regarding the amount and timing of the insurance cash /flows. This includes both underwriting risk and /financial risk. Storebrand Livsforsikring o/ffers traditional life and pension insurance as both collective and individual contracts, and contracts where the customer has investment choices are also o/ffered.\n\nThe insurance risk linked to an increase in life expectancy and thus an increase in future pension payments (long life) is the biggest insurance risk in the Group, in addition there is the risk of disability and the risk of death. The life insurance risks are:\n\n- 1. Long life - Risk of incorrect estimation of life expectancy and future pension payments. Historical development has shown that more insured persons reach retirement age and live longer as pensioners compared to before. There is considerable uncertainty related to future mortality trends. If life expectancy is increased beyond what is provided for in the premium tari/ffs, the risk that the owner's pro/fit will have to be charged to cover the necessary provisioning needs also increases.\n- 2. Disability - Risk of incorrect estimation of future illness and disability. There will be uncertainty related to the future development of disability, including disability pensioners who are reactivated back into working life.\n- 3. Death - Risk of incorrect estimation of deaths and incorrect estimation of payment to bereaved. In recent years, decreasing mortality and fewer young bereaved have been recorded compared to the past.\n\nThe biggest insurance risks in non-life insurance lie in potential errors in the provisions for the long-tailed products Occupational Injury and Motor Liability, the risk of major damage in the event of /fire in commercial buildings, housing associations and residential buildings and events such as torrential rain. Motor insurance is a large portfolio with seasonal variation and risks linked to weather and driving conditions. Remaining damage products have a more limited risk in terms of underlying volatility and volume.\n\n## Life insurance Norway\n\n## Additional statutory reserves\n\nIn order to ensure the solvency of life insurance, the companies have the opportunity to make provisions for additional statutory reserves. The additional statutory reserves are distributed among the contracts and can be used to cover a negative interest result up to the interest guarantee. If the company does not achieve a return in one year that corresponds to the interest guarantee, the provision can be carried back from the contract so that the company is able to meet the interest guarantee. This means that the additional statutory reserves are reduced and that the premium reserve is increased accordingly on the contract. For interest insurance, the additional statutory reserves is paid in installments over the payment period.\n\nThe additional statutory reserves can be a maximum of 12 per cent of the premium reserve. If the limit is exceeded, the excess amount is assigned to the contract as surplus.\n\n## Premium fund, deposit fund and pensioners' surplus fund\n\nThe premium fund contains prepaid premiums 'according to the tax law' from the policyholders and added surplus in individual and collective pension insurance. The deposit fund contains payments and deposits for employees with a shorter membership period than 12 months. Deposits and withdrawals are not shown on the pro/fit and loss, but directly on the balance sheet.",

Appendix\n\nThe pensioners' surplus fund consists of surplus allocated to the premium reserve linked to pensions under payment in collective pension insurance. The fund must be used each year as a one-o/ff premium to supplement the pensioners' bene/fits.\n\n## Bu/ffer fund\n\nRules on a pooled and customer-distributed bu/ffer fund were introduced for municipal pension schemes with e/ffect from 1 January 2022. Correspondingly, a bu/ffer fund will be introduced for private pension schemes from 1 January 2024. The bu/ffer fund replaces previous additional provisions and rate adjustment funds for private pension schemes. The bu/ffer fund will be distributed among the contracts, and will be able to cover negative returns and lack of returns until the contract's annual interest guarantee. The company can set aside all or part of a surplus on the return result to a bu/ffer fund. Furthermore, funds in the bu/ffer fund can be assigned to the customer as surplus.\n\n## Market value adjustment reserves\n\nThe year's net unrealized gains/losses on /financial assets at fair value in the collective portfolio are added/returned from the market value adjustment reserves in the balance sheet on the condition that the portfolio has a net unrealized surplus value. The part of the net unrealized gain/loss on /financial current assets in foreign currency that can be attributed to exchange rate changes is not allocated to the market value adjustment reserves. The currency risk on foreign investments is mainly hedged with currency contracts at portfolio level. Exchange rate changes associated with the hedging instrument are therefore not allocated to the market value adjustment reserves either.\n\n## Risk equalisation fund\n\nThere is an opportunity to set aside up to 50 per cent of the positive risk result for group pensions and free policies to a risk equalisation fund to cover any future negative risk result. The risk equalization fund is recognized as a liability according to IFRS.\n\n## Life insurance Sweden\n\nConditional bonus and deferred capital contribution\n\nThe conditional bonus arises when the value of customer assets is higher than the present value of the liabilities, and thus covers the portion of the insurance capital that is not guaranteed. In the case of contracts where customer assets are lower than liabilities, the owners' result is charged via deferred capital contribution allocations. The conditional bonus and deferred capital contribution are recognised on the same line in the balance sheet as part of the bu/ffer capital.\n\n## Insurance service result\n\nThe insurance service result is the pro/fit from the insurance contracts. For contracts that are reported according to the general measurement model (GMM) and the variable fee approach (VFA), the insurance service result in the period consist of income recognition of CSM based on the coverage unit, change in risk adjustment, the di/fference between expected and actual payments (only for VFA), the di/fference between expected and actual costs, change in LRC and LIC and loss or reversal of loss for onerous contracts. The insurance service result for contracts reported according to the premium allocation approach (PAA) consists of premiums in the period. An equal premium is modeled for each reporting period.\n\nThe insurance costs consist of actual costs and claims, changes in LIC and loss or reversal of loss for onerous contracts.\n\nThe calculation of the insurance reserve for life insurance is made using estimates and assumptions. Future cash /flows are estimated with assumptions such as expected life expectancy, mortality and disability, as well as assumptions about changes in the insurance relationship such as moving the insurance to another provider. All assumptions are revised annually, and more frequently if necessary. The assumptions used is harmonized with those used in reporting under Solvency II.\n\nThe future cash /flows are generated using in-house developed software, which is the same as that used for Solvency II. In addition to the assumption, information is used about the insurance portfolios and product characteristics, such as e.g. pro/fit sharing in the modelling.\n\nNet reinsurance cost/income is included in the insurance service result, since the reinsurance program for the Group is limited, it is considered to be adequate.\n\n## Governance of insurance risk\n\nThe insurance risk is monitored within each portfolio, and for pro/fitable and onerous contracts respectively. Collective disability pension in Norway, where there is no possibility to use the carve-out exemption from the EU, the insurance risk is additionally monitored per cohort. The development of the insurance service results is followed throughout the year. Insurance cases of which the company has not been noti/fied, but which experience has to assume have occurred, have been taken into account.",

Appendix\n\nWhen entering a contract for individual risk products in Norway, a health assessment of the customer is carried out. The result of the assessment is re/flected in the level of the risk premium required. When entering into collective agreements with risk coverage, a health assessment is made of the employees in companies with few employees, otherwise a declaration of /fitness for work is required. In the assessment of risk, the company's business category, industry and medical history can also be taken into account.\n\nFor all products, major damage or special events pose a major risk. The largest claims will typically be within group life, occupational injury and personal injury motor, which report according to PAA.\n\nStorebrand manages its insurance risk through various reinsurance programmes. Through catastrophe reinsurance (excess of loss), losses (one-o/ff compensation and reserve provisions) beyond a lower limit are covered in the event of 2 or more deaths or cases of disability as a result of the same event. The coverage also has an upper limit. Through a reinsurance agreement for a single life, death and disability risks that exceed the company's practiced maximum risk amount are covered at your own expense. The company's maximum risk amounts for its own account are relatively high and the reinsured risk is therefore of modest size.\n\nThe company also manages its insurance risk through international pooling. This means that multinational business customers can equalize the results between the various units internationally. Pooling is o/ffered for group life and risk coverage within collective pensions.\n\n## Sensitivities\n\nThe sensitivities show the e/ffect for the IFRS /financial statement of changes in /financial and non-/financial variables. The e/ffect is stated for cash /flows for ful/fillment and contractual service margin (CSM) or loss component for the main products reported under the variable fee approach (VFA) and general measurement model (GMM) in accordance with IFRS17.\n\nChanges in ful/fillment cash /flows do not a/ffect the result directly, but a/ffect the result through changes in the CSM or loss component. CSM is transformed into pro/fit as the contractual obligation is delivered. A lower CSM will correspond to a proportional drop in future results. The CSM cannot be negative, so further decline will lead to a loss component with an immediate negative e/ffect on earnings. Correspondingly, an increase in the loss component will correspond to an immediate negative result e/ffect.\n\nThe investment strategy is to achieve risk premiums through investments in debt instruments, stocks and real assets, and the /financial result is therefore a/ffected by the development in this type of assets. In the guaranteed customer portfolios, the risk is adapted to the risk capacity for each investment pro/file. For SPP, the adaptation is individualised, and the investment risk is adapted to the risk capacity of each individual customer.\n\nFor SPP, the e/ffect on CSM from interest rate movements will be limited as the interest rate sensitivity on the asset side matches closely with the liability side. However, the interest rate hedge is designed to minimize volatility in the /financial result according to Swedish GAAP, and there may therefore be some volatility in CSM due to the di/fferences between the two accounting standards (IFRS and Swedish GAAP).\n\nBecause it is the immediate market changes that are calculated, dynamic risk management will not a/ffect the outcome. If one assumes that the market changes occur over a period of time, dynamic risk management will reduce the e/ffect of the negative outcomes and to some extent reinforce the positive results.\n\nThe insurance risk and the /financial market risk a/ffect the CSM volatility and thus the result. The sensitivities give an indication of the uncertainty of the mentioned risks. Storebrand's products have di/fferent insurance and /financial market risks, but the sensitivity calculation is based on the same sensitivities for each product as it is assumed that any changes in the assumptions are evenly distributed between the products. The sensitivities are calculated separately for SPP and Storebrand Livsforsikring.\n\nThe sensitivities are chosen based on an assumption that they are expected to have the greatest impact on the results.\n\n- 1. Non-/financial: Costs, mortality, disability and reactivation\n- 2. Financial: Risk-free interest rate curve up and down, property, credit spread and stocks",

Ap/fiendix\n\nThe following sensitivities are calculated for products reporting according to GMM and VFA:\n\nFinancial sensitivities:\n\n- \u00b7  Interest rate up 50bp: The interest rate curve is shifted in parallel by 50 basis points for the /first 10 years, which constitutes the liquid part of the curve. It is then extrapolated against the UFR (ultimate forward rate).\n- \u00b7  Interest rates down 50bp: The interest rate curve is shifted in parallel down 50 basis points for the /first 10 years, which constitutes the liquid part of the curve. It is then extrapolated against the UFR.\n- \u00b7  Shares -25 per cent: The value of all shares is reduced by 25 per cent.\n- \u00b7  Spread +50bp: The credit spread is increased by 50 basis points. The liquidity premium on the discount curve is increased by 15 basis points.\n- \u00b7  Property -10 percent: The value of property is reduced by 10 percent.\n\nNon-/financial sensitivities:\n\n- \u00b7  Costs +5 per cent: All administration and overhead costs are increased by 5 per cent for all years in the projection.\n- \u00b7  Disability +5 percent, reactivation -5 percent: Best estimate for disability is increased by 5 percent, while reactivation is reduced by 5 percent.\n- \u00b7  Mortality -5 percent: The level of the best estimate for mortality is reduced by 5 percent, while the trend is kept unchanged.\n\nThe table shows the CSM e/ffect as of 31/12/2023 for the sensitivities mentioned.\n\n| NOK million        | CSM at end of period   | Impact on CSM   |\n|--------------------|------------------------|-----------------|\n| 10,801             | 10,801                 | 10,801          |\n| Equity down        |                        | -1,842          |\n| Property down      |                        | -1,098          |\n| Interest rate up   |                        | 949             |\n| Interest rate down |                        | -839            |\n| Spread up          |                        | -891            |\n| Mortality down     |                        | -401            |\n| Disability up      |                        | -0              |\n| Exoenses up        |                        | -298            |\n\nThe sensitivity calculations indicate that /financial market risk has the greatest impact on CSM. A fall in equity, property and interest reduces the CSM, as it reduces the likelihood of achieving a return in line with the guarantee. In addition, Storebrand's income is reduced in line with the lower market value of the portfolio. CSM is also negatively a/ffected with the increase in credit spreads and volatility adjustment. Changes in non-/financial factors have a lower impact on CSM.\n\nFor the products that report according to PAA, the following sensitivities have been calculated:\n\n| NOK million                                            |   E/ffect on inurance  contracts liabilities |   E/ffect on pro/fit  before tax |   E/ffect on equity |\n|--------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|---------------------|\n| 5 per cent increase in insurance contracts liabilities |                                          365 |                             -364 |                -276 |\n| 5  per cent increase in claim ratio                    |                                          150 |                             -275 |                -207 |\n\nThe table above shows the e/ffect on insurance contract liabilities, pro/fit before tax and equity of a 5 percent increase in compensation provisions and a 5 percentage point change in the claims percentage.\n\nSee also information on insurance contract liabilities in notes 17 and 37.",

Ap/fiendix\n\n## Note 8: Liquidity risk\n\nLiquidity risk is the risk that the company is unable to ful/fil its obligations without incurring substantial additional expenses in the form of reduced prices for assets that must be realised, or in the form of especially expensive /financing.\n\nFor the insurance companies, the life insurance companies in particular, the insurance liabilities are long-term and the cash /flows are generally known long before they fall due. In addition, liquidity is required to handle payments related to operations, and there are liquidity needs related to derivative contracts. The liquidity risk is handled by liquidity forecasts and the fact that portions of the investments are in very liquid securities, such as government bonds. The liquidity risk is considered low based on these measures.\n\nLiquidity risk is one of the largest risk factors for the banking business, and the regulations stipulate requirements for liquidity management and liquidity indicators. The Bank's risk strategy stipulates that the liquidity risk must be low to moderate. The guidelines for liquidity risk specify principles for liquidity management, and limits stipulated by the Board for di/fferent minimum liquidity and /financing indicators. In addition to this, an annual funding strategy and funding plan are being drawn up that set out the overall limits for the bank's funding activities.\n\nSeparate liquidity strategies have also been drawn up for other subsidiaries in accordance with the statutory requirements. These strategies specify limits and measures for ensuring good liquidity and a minimum allocation to assets that can be sold at short notice. The strategies de/fine limits for allocations to various asset types and mean the companies have money market investments, bonds, equities and other liquid investments that can be disposed of as required.\n\nIn addition to clear strategies and the risk management of liquidity reserves in each subsidiary, the Group's holding company has established a liquidity bu/ffer. The development of the liquid holdings is continuously monitored at the Group level in relation to internal limits. A particular risk is the fact that during certain periods the /financial markets can be closed for new borrowing. Measures for minimising the liquidity risk are to maintain a regular maturity structure for the loans, low costs, an adequate liquidity bu/ffer and credit agreements with banks which the company can draw on if necessary.\n\nUndiscounted cash /flows for /financial liabilities 1)\n\n| NOK million                                         | 0-6            months   | 7-12         months   | 2-3              years   | 4-5                   years   | > 5 years   | Total  cash- /flows   | Total  booked  value  2023   | Total  booked  value  2022   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------|-----------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|\n| Subordinated loan capital  2)                       | 1,105                   | 1,361                 | 3,331                    | 4,854                         | 3,555       | 14,204                | 11,501                       | 10,585                       |\n| Loans and deposits from credit  institutions        | 283                     |                       |                          |                               |             | 283                   | 283                          | 403                          |\n| Deposits from bank customers                        | 23,611                  | 10                    | 133                      | 54                            | 139         | 23,948                | 23,948                       | 19,478                       |\n| Debt raised from issuance of  securities            | 6,512                   | 1,438                 | 20,953                   | 14,428                        | 1,377       | 44,707                | 40,655                       | 32,791                       |\n| Other current liabilities                           | 51,037                  | 15                    | 167                      | 1                             |             | 51,220                | 51,015                       | 8,923                        |\n| Derivatives                                         | 926                     | 80                    | 245                      | 337                           | 4,517       | 6,105                 | 6,118                        | 12,641                       |\n| Uncalled residual liabilities Limit- ed partnership | 3,990                   |                       |                          |                               |             | 3,990                 |                              |                              |\n| Unused credit lines lending                         | 19,833                  |                       |                          |                               |             | 19,833                |                              |                              |\n| Lending commitments                                 | 2,607                   |                       |                          |                               |             | 2,607                 |                              |                              |\n| Total /financial liabilities                        | 109,903                 | 2,903                 | 24,829                   | 19,674                        | 9,588       | 166,897               | 133,520                      |                              |\n| Total /financial liabilities 2022                   | 57,719                  | 2,276                 | 17,127                   | 12,862                        | 4,313       | 94,297                |                              | 84,820                       |\n\n- 1) Liabilities for which repayment may be demanded immediately are included in the 0-6 month column.\n- 2) In the case of perpetual subordinated loans the cash /flow is calculated through to the /first call date.",

This risk also includes losses on lending and losses related to the failure of counterparties to ful/fil their /financial derivative contracts.\n\nThe maximum limits for credit exposure to individual counterparties and for overall credit exposure to rating categories are set by the boards of the individual companies in the Group. Particular attention is paid to ensuring diversi/fication of credit exposure in order to avoid concentrating credit exposure on any particular debtors or sectors. Changes in the credit standing of debtors are monitored and followed up. Thus far, the Group has used published credit ratings wherever possible, supplemented by the company's own credit evaluation.\n\nUnderlying investments in funds managed by Storebrand are included in the tables.",

The home loans are approved and administered by Storebrand Bank, but a signi/ficant share of the loans have been transferred to Storebrand Livsforsikring as a part of the investment portfolio. Storebrand Livsforsikring and SPP also have loans to companies as part of the investment portfolio. Storebrand Bank's corporate market segment has largely been discontinued.\n\nAs at 31 December 2023, Storebrand had net loans to customers totalling NOK 86.9 billion before provisions for losses of NOK 0.1 billion.\n\nThe corporate market portfolio consists of income generating properties and development properties with few customers and low level of default that are primarily secured by mortgages in commercial property.\n\nIn the retail market, most of the loans are secured by means of home mortgages. Customers are evaluated according to their capacity and intent to repay the loan. In addition to their capacity to service debt, checks are conducted of customers in relation to policy rules and they are given a credit rating. There is a low level of non-performing loans in the retail market portfolio.\n\nThe weighted average loan-to-value ratio for home loans is approximately 62 (57) per cent. Approximately 43 (57) per cent of home loans have a loan-to-value ratio within 60 per cent, 87 (97) per cent are within a 85 per cent loan-to-value ratio, and 99 (99) per cent are within a 100 per cent  loan-to-value ratio. The portfolio is considered to have a low credit risk.",

Ap/fiendix\n\n## Note 10: Concentrations of risk\n\nMost of the risk for the Storebrand Group relates to the guaranteed pension products in the life insurance companies. These risks are consolidated in the Storebrand Livsforsikring Group, which includes Storebrand Livsforsikring AS, SPP Pension & F\u00f6rs\u00e4kring AB and Storebrand Danica AS. Other companies directly owned by Storebrand ASA that are exposed to signi/ficant risks are Storebrand Forsikring AS, Storebrand Helseforsikring AS, Storebrand Asset Management Group and Storebrand Bank Group.\n\nFor the life insurance businesses, the greatest risks are largely the same in Norway and Sweden. The /financial market risk will depend signi/ficantly on global circumstances that in/fluence the investment portfolios in all businesses. The insurance risk may be di/fferent for the various companies, and risk of long life expectancy in particular can be in/fluenced by universal trends.\n\nBoth the insurance business and the banking business are exposed to credit risk. The insurance business primarily has a credit risk relating to bonds with signi/ficant geographical and industry-related diversi/fication, while the bank is mostly exposed to direct loans for residential property in Norway. There is no signi/ficant concentration risk across bonds and loans.\n\nThe /financial market and investment risks are largely related to the customer portfolios in the life insurance business. The risk associated with a negative outcome in the /financial market is described and quanti/fied in Note 8, /financial market risk. The banking business has little direct exposure to types of risk other than credit.\n\nIn the short term, an interest rate increase will negatively impact on the returns for the life insurance companies. An interest rate increase can also result in bank customers having lower debt-servicing capacity and increased losses for the banking business.\n\nThe risk from the P&C insurance and health insurance risk in Storebrand Skadeforsikring AS and Storebrand Helseforsikring AS has a low correlation with the risk from the rest of the businesses in the Group.\n\nIn the asset management business, the principal risk is operational risk in the form of behaviour that can trigger claims and/or impact on reputation. Since the asset management business is the principal manager of the insurance businesses, errors in asset management could result in errors in the insurance businesses.\n\n## Note 11: Climate risk\n\nStorebrand is exposed to climate risk, both in operations, for investments including property and for insurance obligations. Both physical climate changes and risks from the transition to low emissions can have an impact. For Storebrand, transition risk has the greatest impact, especially in the short and medium term.\n\nThe biggest risk is from the investments. Given a rapid transition to low emissions, the value of shares and bonds in companies with large climate emissions may fall. Lower returns can a/ffect results because income depends on the value of investments. The life insurance obligation can also change if the /financial markets are a/ffected by climate risk. The risk can impact the costs for the guaranteed pension obligation, especially in scenarios where the investment return is lower than the return guarantee. Storebrand has a sustainability strategy which means that the exposure to shares and bonds in fossil fuel companies is limited. Emissions of greenhouse gases in relation to turnover for the overall investment portfolio are lower than the general market. The risk can be o/ffset somewhat by Storebrand's investments in solution companies that will bene/fit from a rapid transition to a low emissions society. But these companies also have a risk of a fall in value, especially if the transition to low emissions in the society is slower than expected.\n\nPhysical climate changes can also a/ffect the value of the investments. Storebrand has a well-diversi/fied portfolio of shares and bonds, both geographically, across industries and towards individual companies. It limits the risk from some parts of the world, some industries and some companies experiencing large falls in value as a consequence of climate change. But climate change can also lead to lower economic growth and lower investment returns for the wider market, especially in the long term.\n\nFor investments that are priced in an active market, Storebrand's valuation is based on climate risk being taken into account in the market's pricing. It has not been identi/fied that climate risk associated with investments has had a signi/ficant impact on the /financial statements for 2023.\n\nStorebrand has climate risk from property investments. There is a transition risk from the fact that there may be high costs for adapting buildings to achieve lower climate emissions. There is also physical risk, especially from increased incidents of extreme rainfall and /flooding.",

Ap/fiendix\n\nThe valuation of property is based on information that is not observable, level 3, see note 12. Climate risk can a/ffect the valuation both through calculated cash /flows and return requirements for the property. The cash /flow can be a/ffected, for example, because climate change creates a need for upgrades or because the ownership costs are a/ffected by the building's energy e/fficiency. The property's environmental standard is one of the factors considered when the yield is set.\n\nStorebrand has a risk that there may be lower demand for our products if customers are negatively a/ffected by climate risk. A rapid transition to low emissions could a/ffect the Norwegian economy in general and the oil sector in particular. In Norway, there is usually a connection between unemployment and disability. Negative e/ffects for the Norwegian economy of a rapid transition to low emissions can therefore result in more cases of disability.\n\nFor non-life insurance, there may be more claims and higher claim payouts as a consequence of climate and natural changes. The biggest risk is damage from extreme rainfall or /flooding, especially for property below ground level. In principle, Storebrand Forsikring can increase the insurance premium when more extreme weather results in more expensive insurance cases. In practice, it is di/fficult to adapt the premium to rapid climate and weather changes. 2023 was an extreme year compared to previous experiences and has a/ffected the results negatively. The natural damage pool has a risk-reducing e/ffect in the short term, but can contribute to the fact that necessary premium increases are not carried out because the negative e/ffect on the company's results is delayed. In the short term, there is a risk of mispricing in all scenarios, and the risk may increase over time.\n\n## Note 12: Valuation of /financial instruments and properties\n\nThe group carries out a comprehensive process to ensure the most market-correct valuation of /financial instruments. Listed /financial instruments are valued based on o/fficial closing prices from stock exchanges obtained through Re/finitiv and Bloomberg. Fund units are generally valued at updated o/fficial NAV rates where such are available. As a general rule, bonds are valued based on rates obtained from Nordic bond pricing and Bloomberg. Bonds where reliable prices are not regularly quoted are theoretically valued based on discounted cash /flow. The discount rate consists of swap rates plus a credit spread that is speci/fic to the individual bond. Unlisted derivatives such as currency forwards, interest rate and currency swaps are also valued theoretically. Swap rates and exchange rates that form the basis of the valuation are obtained from Re/finitiv and Bloomberg. The valuation of currency options and Swaptions is provided by Markit.\n\nThe group categorises /financial instruments that are valued at fair value at three di/fferent levels, which are described in more detail below. The levels express di/fferent degrees of liquidity and di/fferent measurement methods. The company has established valuation models to capture information from a wide range of well-informed sources with a view to minimising uncertainty linked to the valuation.\n\n## Level 1: Financial instruments valued on the basis of quoted prices for identical assets in active markets\n\nThis category encompasses listed equities that over the previous quarter have experienced average daily trading equivalent to approximately NOK 20 million or more. Based on this, the equities are regarded as su/fficiently liquid to be included at this level. Bonds, certi/ficates or equivalent instruments issued by national governments in local currencies are generally classi/fied as level 1. When it comes to derivatives, standardized stock index futures and interest rate futures will also be included at this level.\n\nLevel 2: Financial instruments valued on the basis of observable market information not covered by level 1 This category encompasses /financial instruments that are valued on the basis of market information that can be directly observable or indirectly observable. Market information that is indirectly observable means that the prices can be derived from observable related markets. Level 2 includes shares or equivalent equity instruments for which market prices are available, but where the volume of transactions is too limited to ful/fil the criteria in level 1. Shares in this level will normally have been traded during the last quarter. Bonds and equivalent instruments are generally classi/fied in this level. Moreover, interest rate and foreign exchange swaps, as well as non-standardized interest rate and foreign exchange derivatives are classi/fied as level 2. Fund investments, including hedge funds but excluding other alternative investment funds, are generally classi/fied as level 2.\n\nLevel 3: Financial instruments valued on the basis of information that is not observable in accordance with level 2 Equities classi/fied as level 3 are primarily investments in unlisted/private companies as well as funds consisting of these. These include investments in forestry, micro/finance, infrastructure and property. Private equity is generally classi/fied at this level through direct investments or investments in funds. Private customer loans and funds consisting of these are also at level 3.\n\nThe types of mutual funds classi/fied as level 3 are discussed in more detail below with a reference to the type of mutual fund and the valuation method.",

Ap/fiendix\n\n## Equities\n\nThe group's internal companies are classi/fied at level 3 and valued at book value. Of external companies, alternative investments organized as joint stock companies make up the majority. These are valued based on value-adjusted equity reported from external sources when available.\n\n## Units\n\nOf fund shares, private equity funds make up the majority at level 3. There are also some other types of funds such as infrastructure funds, micro/finance funds, loan funds and property funds. The fund investments are valued based on the values reported from the funds. Most funds report quarterly, while some report less frequently. The reporting takes place with a one-month delay for the group's own private equity funds in funds up to a three-month delay for other funds. The last valuation received is used as a basis, adjusted for cash /flows and estimated market e/ffect in the period from the last valuation until the time of reporting where relevant. Market e/ffect is calculated for the company's own vintage private equity funds in funds based on the value development in the relevant index multiplied by the estimated beta of 0.5 against this index.\n\n## Loans to customers\n\nThe value of /fixed-rate loans is determined by discounting the agreed cash /flows over the remaining maturity by the current discount rate adjusted for market spread. The discount rate that is used is based on a swap interest rate (mid swap) with a maturity that corresponds to the remaining lock-in period for the underlying loans. The market spread that is used on the balance sheet date is determined by assessing the market conditions, market price and the associated swap interest rate. However, the fair value of loans to corporate customers with margin loans is lower than the amortised cost because certain loans run with lower margins than they would have done if they had been taken up as of the end of 2023. The value shortfall is calculated by discounting the di/fference between the agreed margin and the current market price over the remaining duration.\n\n## Corporate bonds\n\nBonds do not normally occur at level 3, but defaulted bonds are categorized at this level and valued based on the expected payout. As of 31.12.23, this was not a signi/ficant amount for Storebrand.\n\n## Investment properties\n\nThe investment properties primarily consist of o/ffice buildings located in Oslo and Stockholm and shopping centres in Southern Norway.\n\n## O/ffice properties and shopping centres in Norway:\n\nThe required rate of return is of greatest importance when calculating the fair value for investment properties.\n\nAn individual required rate of return is determined for each property. The knowledge available about the market's required rate of return, including transactions and appraisals, is used when determining the cash /flow.\n\nThe required rate of return is divided into the following elements:\n\n- \u00b7  Risk-free interest\n- \u00b7  Risk premium, adjusted for:\n- \u00b7  Type of property\n- \u00b7   Location\n- \u00b7  Structural standard\n- \u00b7   Environmental standard and BREEAM serti/fication\n- \u00b7  Duration of the contract\n- \u00b7  Quality of tenant\n- \u00b7   Other factors such as transactions and perception in the market, vacancy and general knowledge about the market and the individual property.\n\nWhen calculating fair value, Storebrand uses internal cash /flow models. Net cash /flows for the individual property are discounted by an individual required rate of return. A future income and expense picture for the /first 10 years has been estimated for the o/ffice properties and a /final value has been calculated for the end of the 10th year based on market rent and normal operating costs for the property. A future income and expense picture for the /first 6 years has been estimated for the shopping centre properties and a /final value has been calculated for the end of the 6th year based on market rent and normal operating costs for the property.  In both models, the net income stream has been taken into consideration for existing and future loss of income due to vacancy, necessary investments and an assessment of the future development in the market rent. The majority of new contracts that are entered into have a duration of /five or ten years for o/ffices (three to /five years for trading). The cash /flows from the lease agreements (contractual rent) are included in the valuations. To estimate the long-term, future non-contractual rental incomes, a forecasting model has been developed.

Ap/fiendix\n\no/ffice model is based on the rental price overview from Area statistics, as well as data and observations from brokers. A long-term, time-weighted average of the annual observations is calculated in which the oldest observations are weighted with the lowest importance. For non-contractual rent in the short-term, the current rental prices and market situation are used. For trading, the forecast is based on the development of the shopping centre.\n\n## External valuation:\n\nFor properties in the Norwegian business, a methodical approach is taken to a selection of properties that are to be externally valued each quarter so that all properties have had an external valuation at least every three years. In 2023, external valuations were obtained for properties worth NOK 17.2 billion (74 per cent of the portfolio's value as at 31 December 2023).\n\nFor quality control and updating of the internal model, external valuations shall be obtained each quarter from reputable appraisers to verify the value that appears when using the internal model. When obtaining such valuations, the individual appraiser's routines for valuations, including collection of information, inspections etc., shall apply. External valuations shall be rotated in such a way that all segments are regularly appraised. The task of valuing investment properties shall be rotated between reputable appraisers within a reasonable time interval, and knowledge of the property must be taken into consideration. The assumptions for the external valuation are critically reviewed and reasonableness assessed against internal assumptions. In the event of a discrepancy between the valuation and value obtained using the internal model, the model shall be used as long as the discrepancy is within what is discretionarily considered to be best practice in the market. If there is a discrepancy of more than 5% between the internal and external valuation, the discrepancy shall be reported and the grounds for this provided in the valuation memorandum/valuation item memorandum that is presented to the Board of Storebrand Livsforsikring AS.\n\nExternal valuations are obtained for properties in the Swedish business. Shopping centres and commercial premises are valued annually, while other wholly-owned property investments are valued on a quarterly basis.\n\nValuation of /financial instruments to amortised cost\n\n| NOK million                                   | Level 2 Observable  assump-  tions   | Level 3 Non-  observable  assump-  tions   | Total fair value  31.12.23   | Book value    31.12.23   | Total fair value  31.12.22   | Book value    31.12.22   |\n|-----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|------------------------------|--------------------------|------------------------------|--------------------------|\n| Financial assets                              |                                      |                                            |                              |                          |                              |                          |\n| Loans to and due from /financial institutions |                                      | 1,138                                      | 1,138                        | 1,138                    | 109                          | 109                      |\n| Loans to customers - retail                   |                                      | 376                                        | 375                          | 375                      | 452                          | 452                      |\n| Bonds held to maturity                        | 20                                   |                                            | 20                           | 20                       |                              |                          |\n| Bonds classi/fied as loans and receivables    | 6,002                                |                                            | 6,002                        | 6,010                    | 4,266                        | 4,281                    |\n| Total /financial assets 31.12.2023            | 6,022                                | 1,514                                      | 7,535                        | 7,543                    |                              |                          |\n| Total /financial assets 31.12.2022            | 4,266                                | 560                                        |                              |                          | 4,826                        | 4,841                    |\n| Financial liabilities                         |                                      |                                            |                              |                          |                              |                          |\n| Debt raised by issuance of securities         | 40,668                               |                                            | 40,668                       | 40,655                   | 32,777                       | 32,791                   |\n| Loans and deposits from credit institutions   | 283                                  |                                            | 283                          | 283                      | 403                          | 403                      |\n| Deposits from banking customers               | 23,948                               |                                            | 23,948                       | 23,948                   | 19,478                       | 19,478                   |\n| Subordinated loan capital                     | 11,528                               |                                            | 11,528                       | 11,501                   | 10,513                       | 10,585                   |\n| Total /financial liabilities 31.12.2023       | 76,427                               |                                            | 76,427                       | 76,387                   |                              |                          |\n| Total /financial liabilities 31.12.2022       | 63,171                               |                                            |                              |                          | 63,171                       | 63,256                   |",

Increased interest rates have a negative impact through increased yields and more demanding conditions for loan /financing in transactions. At the same time, property investments have historically provided in/flation protection through regulations in market rents and increased cash /flows. A change of 0.25 per cent in the return requirement, all else being equal, will result in a change in the value of the property portfolio in Storebrand of around 6 per cent. Around 25 per cent of the property's cash /flow is linked to leases entered. This means that the changes in the uncertain parts of the cash /flow by 1 per cent result in a change in value of 0.70 to 0.75 per cent. The property's cash /flows will also be a/ffected by in/flation expectations and the vacancy level in the portfolio. Storebrand's property portfolio mainly consists of o/ffice properties that have an attractive location in the central business district (CBD). The location means that the properties have historically been less exposed to market /fluctuations than properties located in the edge zone, but there is uncertainty associated with the calculation of the values given volatility in the market. See further discussion of the uncertainty in note 8.\n\n|                                   | Change in required rate of return   | Change in required rate of return   |\n|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|\n| NOK million                       | 0.25 %                              | -0.25 %                             |\n| Change in fair value per 31.12.23 | -1,607                              | 1,782                               |\n| Change in fair value per 31.12.22 | -2,251                              | 2,555                               |",

Storebrand calculates Solvency II according to the standard method as de/fined in the Solvency II Regulations.\n\nConsolidation is carried out in accordance with Section 18-2 of the Norwegian Act relating to Financial Undertakings and Financial Groups.\n\nThe solvency capital requirement and the minimum capital requirement for the Group are calculated in accordance with Section 46 (1)-(3) of the Solvency II Regulations in accordance with the standard method.\n\n## Capital management\n\nStorebrand pays particular attention to the levels of equity in the Group, which are continually and systematically optimised. The level is adapted to the /financial risk and capital requirement in the business, where the growth and composition of business segments will be important motivating factors for the need for capital. The purpose of capital management is to ensure an e/fficient capital structure and provide for an appropriate balance between in-house goals and regulatory and rating agency requirements. If there is a need for new equity, this is obtained by the holding company Storebrand ASA, which is listed and the ultimate parent company.\n\nThe Storebrand companies are subject to various capital requirements depending on the type of business. In addition to the capital requirements for the Storebrand Group and insurance companies, the banking and asset management business has capital requirements that are in accordance with CRD IV. The companies in the group governed by CRD IV are included in the group's solvency capital and solvency capital requirements with their respective primary capital and capital requirements.\n\nStorebrand has the goal of paying a dividend of more than 50 per cent of the Group pro/fit after tax. The Board's ambition is to ensure that the ordinary dividend per share shall at least be at the same nominal level as the previous year. The normal dividend is paid out at a sustainable solvency margin of over 150 per cent. If the solvency margin is over 175 per cent, the Board's intention is to propose an extraordinary dividend or buyback of shares. In general, equity in the Group can be controlled without material limitations if the capital requirement is met and the respective legal units have su/fficient solvency.",

The company's pension schemes meet the requirements of the law.\n\nStorebrand Group has country-speci/fic pension schemes.\n\nStorebrand's employees in Norway have a de/fined-contribution pension scheme. In a de/fined-contribution scheme, the company allocates an agreed contribution to a pension account. The future pension depends upon the amount of the contributions and the return on the pension account.  When the contributions have been paid, the company has no further payment obligations relating to the de/fined-contribution pension and the payment to the pension account is charged as an expense on an ongoing basis. For regulatory reasons, there can be no savings in the de/fined-contribution pension for salaries that exceed 12G (G = National Insurance Scheme basic amount). Storebrand has pension savings in the savings product Extra Pension for employees with salaries exceeding 12G.\n\nThe premiums and content of the de/fined-contribution pension scheme are as follows:\n\n- -Saving starts from the /first krone of salary.\n- -Savings rate of 7 per cent of salary from 0 to 12 G (the National Insurance basic amount 'G' was NOK 118,620 at 31 December 2023)\n- -In addition, 13 per cent of salary between 7.1 and 12 G is saved.\n- -Savings rate for salary over 12 G is 20 per cent.",

Ap/fiendix\n\nThe Norwegian companies participate in the Joint Scheme for Collective Agreement Pensions (AFP). The private AFP scheme provides a lifelong supplement to an ordinary pension and is a multi-employer pension scheme, but there is no reliable information available for inclusion of this liability on the statement of /financial position. The scheme is /financed by means of an annual premium that is de/fined as a percentage of salaries from 1 G to 7.1 G, and the premium rate was 2.6 % in 2023 and increases to 2.7 % in 2024.\n\nThere are also pension liabilities for the de/fined-bene/fit scheme related to direct pensions for certain former employees and former board members.\n\nThe pension plan for employees at SPP in Sweden follows the plan for bank employees in Sweden (BTP). SPP has a de/fined-contribution occupational pension known as BTP1. All new employees were enrolled in this pension agreement from and including 1 January 2014. In BTP1, the employer pays a premium for pension savings that is calculated based on pensionable salary up to 30 times the 'basic income amount' (inkomstbasbelopp). The insurance includes retirement pension with or without mortality inheritance, disability pension and children's pension. The premium is calculated independently of age and is calculated primarily based on the monthly salary. The premium is paid monthly in two parts, a /fixed part that is 2.5 per cent of the pensionable salary up to and including 7.5 times the 'basic income amount'. The optional part of the premium is 2 per cent of salary up to and including 7.5 times the 'basic income amount' and 30 per cent of salary between 7.5 and 30 times the 'basic income amount'.\n\nThe pension in the BTP2 agreement (de/fined-bene/fit occupational pension that is a closed scheme) amounts to 10 per cent of the annual salary up to 7.5 times the 'basic income amount' (which was SEK 74,300 in 2023 and will be SEK 76.200 in 2024), 65 per cent of salary in the interval from 7.5 to 20, and 32.5 per cent in the interval from 20 to 30. No retirement pension is paid for the portion of salary in excess of 30 times the 'basic income amount'. Full pension entitlement is reached after 30 years of membership in the pension scheme. In addition to the de/fined-bene/fit part, the BTP plan has a smaller de/fined-contribution component. Here the employees can decide themselves how assets are to be invested (traditional insurance or unit-linked insurance). The de/fined-contribution part is 4 per cent of the annual salary for employees born in 1967 and later, while the rate is 2 per cent for employees born in 1966 and earlier.\n\nThe retirement age for SPP's CEO is 65 years. The CEO is covered by BTP1. In addition, the CEO has a de/fined-contribution based additional pension with SPP. The premium for this insurance is 20 per cent of salary that exceeds 30 times the 'basic income amount'.\n\nReconciliation of pension assets and liabilities in the statement of /financial position\n\n| NOK million                                                            |   2023 |   2022 |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Present value of insured pension liabilities                           |    953 |    709 |\n| Fair value of pension assets                                           |   -955 |   -867 |\n| Net pension liabilities/assets insured scheme                          |     -1 |   -158 |\n| Asset ceiling  1)                                                      |     35 |    168 |\n| Present value of unsecured liabilities                                 |    138 |    152 |\n| Net pension liabilities recognised in statement of /financial position |    172 |    162 |\n\nBooked in statement of /financial position\n\n| NOK million         |   2023 |   2022 |\n|---------------------|--------|--------|\n| Pension liabilities |    172 |    162 |",

Long-term assumptions such as future in/flation, real interest rates, real wage growth and adjustment of the basic amount are subject to a particularly high degree of uncertainty.\n\nIn Norway, a discount rate based on covered bonds is used. Based on the market and volume trends observed, the Norwegian covered bond market must be perceived as a deep market.\n\nSpeci/fic company conditions including expected direct wage growth are taken into account when determining the /financial assumptions.\n\n## Actuarial assumptions:\n\nIn Norway standardised assumptions on rates of mortality and disability as well as other demographic factors are prepared by Finance Norway. With e/ffect from 2014 a new mortality basis, K2013, has been introduced for group pension insurance in life insurance companies and pension funds. Storebrand has used the mortality table K2013BE (best estimate) in the actuarial calculations at 31 December 2023.\n\nThe actuarial assumptions in Sweden follow the industry's mutual mortality table DUS21 adjusted for corporate di/fferences.\n\n## Sensitivity analysis pension calculations\n\nStorebrand's risk associated with the pension scheme relates to the changes in the /financial and actuarial assumptions that must be used in the calculations and the actual return on the pension funds. The pension liabilities are particularly sensitive to changes in the discount rate. A reduction of the discount rate will in isolation entail an increase in pension liabilities.\n\nFor the Norwegian companies that have converted to de/fined contribution pensions as of 1 January 2015, the sensitivity has not been calculated, and the /figures below illustrate the sensitivity for the Swedish companies.\n\n## Sverige\n\n|                                  | Discount  rate   | Discount  rate   | Expected earnings  growth   | Expected earnings  growth   | Mortality - change in  expected life expectancy   | Mortality - change in  expected life expectancy   |\n|----------------------------------|------------------|------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|\n|                                  | 1.0 %            | -1.0 %           | 1.0 %                       | -1.0 %                      | + 1 year                                          | - 1 year                                          |\n| Percentage change in pension:    |                  |                  |                             |                             |                                                   |                                                   |\n| - Pension liabilities            | -8 %             | 9 %              | -6 %                        | -7 %                        | 5 %                                               | -5 %                                              |\n| - The period's net pension costs | -10 %            | 12 %             | 3 %                         | -3 %                        | 4 %                                               | -4 %                                              |",

In some cases, Storebrand and the Norwegian Tax Administration have had di/fferent interpretations of the tax rules and associated transitional rules. As a result of this, uncertain tax positions arise in connection with the recognised tax expenses. Whether or not the uncertain tax positions have to be recognised in the /financial statements is assessed in accordance with IAS 12 and IFRIC 23. Uncertain tax positions will only be recognised in the /financial statements if the company considers it to be preponderance that the Norwegian Tax Administration's interpretation will be accepted in a court of law. Signi/ficant uncertain tax positions are described below.",

Appendix\n- A. In 2015, Storebrand Livsforsikring AS discontinued the Norwegian subsidiary, Storebrand Eiendom Holding AS, with a tax loss of approximately NOK 6.5 billion and a corresponding increase in the tax loss carryforward. In March 2021 Storebrand received a decision from the Norwegian Tax Administration arguing that the liquidation of Storebrand Eiendom Holding AS resulted in a tax gain of approximately NOK 4.7 billion. Storebrand Livsforsikring AS appealed the decision to the Tax Appeals Commitee in May 2021, which in June 2023 ruled in favor of the company. In December 2023, the Ministry of Finance took legal action against the decision. The company considers it to be probable that Storebrand's understanding of the tax legislation will be accepted by a court of law and thus, no additional uncertain tax position has been recognised in the /financial statements based on the subpoena. If the Norwegian Tax Administration's position is accepted, Storebrand estimates that a tax expense for the company of approximately NOK 1.6 billion will arise. There will also be negative e/ffects for returns on customer assets after tax. The e/ffects are based on best estimates and following a review with external expertise.\n- B. New tax rules for life insurance and pension companies were introduced for the 2018 /financial year. These rules contained transitional rules for how the companies should revalue/write-down the tax values as at 31 December 2018. In December 2018, the Norwegian Directorate of Taxes published an interpretive statement that Storebrand does not consider to be in accordance with the wording of the relevant act. In the tax return for 2018, Storebrand Livsforsikring AS applied the wording in the original transitional rule. However, in October 2019 Storebrand received a notice of adjustment of tax assessment in line with the interpretive statement from the Norwegian Directorate of Taxes and the clari/fication from the Ministry of Finance. Storebrand Livsforsikring AS disagrees with the Norwegian Tax Administration's interpretation but considers it uncertain as to whether the company's interpretation will be accepted if the case is decided by a court of law. In April 2022 Storebrand received a decision from the Norwegian Tax Administration based on similar grounds as the ones outlined in the draft decision. Storebrand continues to disagree with the view of the Norwegian Tax Administration and has challenged the decision to the Norwegian Tax Appeals Committee. As a result of the complaint the Norwegian Tax Administration reversed parts of its own decision in January 2023, and reduced the tax income by approximately NOK 800 million. The remaining parts of the disagreement must be dealt with by the Tax Appeals Commitee. The uncertain tax position is therefore recognized in the /financial statement. Based on our revised best estimate, the di/fference between Storebrand's interpretation and the Norwegian Tax Administration's interpretation is approximately NOK 6.4 billion in an uncertain tax position. If Storebrand's interpretation is accepted, a deferred tax expense of approximately NOK 1.6 billion will be derecognised from the /financial statements.\n- C. The outcome of the interpretation of tax rules for group contributions referred to above under (A) will have an impact when calculating the e/ffect from the transitional rules for the new tax rules referred to under point (B). An equivalent interpretation to that described under (A) has been used as a basis in the /financial statements when calculating tax input values on property shares owned by customer assets for 2016 and 2017. There is thus an uncertain tax position relating to the e/ffect from the transitional rules described in (B). The decisions that Storebrand received in April 2022 and in January 2023 (described under point B) have reduced the uncertain tax position and have resulted in tax revenues of NOK 0.6 billion in the /first quarter and NOK 0.2 billion in the fourth quarter 2022.  The e/ffect as mentioned in point B depends on the interpretation and outcome of point A. In June 2023, the Tax Appeals Committee ruled in favor of Storebrand's interpretation, and therefore generated an additional tax income of approximately NOK 0.44 billion. As already mentioned, the Ministry of Finance took legal action against the decision in December 2023. If the Norwegian Tax Administration prevails with its argument under point (A), Storebrand will recognise a tax expense of approximately NOK 0.5 billion.\n\nStorebrand has reviewed the uncertain tax positions as part of the reporting process. The review has not reduced the company's assessment of the probability that Storebrand's interpretation will be accepted in a court of law. The timeline for the continued process is unclear, but if necessary, Storebrand will seek clari/fication from the court of law for the aforementioned uncertain tax positions.\n\n## Pillar two - minimum taxation\n\nDuring December 2023 and January 2024, both Swedish and Norwegian authorities adopted changes to tax legislation with e/ffect from the income year 2024. The new legislation introduces a supplementary tax, a global minimum taxation which is intended to prevent pro/fit movement between countries, and ensure an e/ffective tax rate of at least 15 percent.\n\nStorebrand is covered by the new regulations. The group is working on the introduction of a supplementary tax, and has not yet /finished analyzing the e/ffects. The Group does not operate in countries with a corporate tax rate below 15 per cent. So far, it seems that the tax consequences will be minimal for Storebrand. Deferred tax related to the new regulation has not been recognised in the 2023 /financial statements.",

Appendix\n\n## Intangible assets linked to the acquisition of SPP\n\nIn 2007, Storebrand Livsforsikring AS acquired SPP Pension & F\u00f6rs\u00e4kring AB and its subsidiaries (SPP).  The majority of the intangible assets linked to the acquisition of SPP was the value of business in force (VIF). After the implementation of IFRS 17, VIF for the insurance contracts is no longer an intangible asset, but part of the contractual service margin which, in the balance sheet, is part of the insurance contract liabilities for guaranteed products. Remaining intangible assets are linked to investment contracts. In order to determine whether goodwill and other intangible assets linked to SPP have been subject to impairment, the recoverable amount is estimated for the relevant cash generating units. Recoverable amounts are determined by calculating the business' value in use. SPP is considered as one cash generating unit and developments in future earnings for SPP will a/ffect the value in use.\n\nIn calculating the value in use, the management has used budgets and forecasts approved by the board for the coming three-year period (2024-2026). For the period 2027-2028, the administration has made assessments and determined an annual growth per element in the results statement. In calculating the terminal value, a growth rate corresponding to Sweden's Riksbank's in/flation target of 2.0 per cent is used. The main drivers of pro/fit growth in the long term will be return on assets, the underlying in/flation and wage developments in the market (which drives premium growth). Value in use is calculated by using a rate of return after tax of 8.1 per cent. The rate of return is calculated based on the risk-free interest rate and added a premium that re/flects the risk in the business.\n\nCalculations related to the future will be uncertain. The value will be a/ffected by various growth parameters, expected return as well as rate of return is used as a basis, etc. It is speci/fied that the aim of the calculation is to achieve su/fficient certainty that the value in use, cf. IAS 36, is not lower than the value recognized in the balance sheet. Simulation with reasonable and also conservative assumptions indicates a value for the investment that defends the book value.\n\n## Intangible assets linked to the banking business\n\nWhen calculating the utility value for the banking business, a cash /flow based assessment of value has been made using the expected pro/fit after taxes. Budgets and forecasts approved by the Board for the next three years are used as the basis for the valuation. The cash /flow is based on two elements, pro/fit/loss to equity and change in expected regulatory tying-up of capital. It is also assumed that all capital in addition to regulatory tied-up capital, can be withdrawn at the end of each period. The management has made assessments for the period from 2027 to 2033, and the annual growth has been determined in the income statement. A growth rate of 2.0 per cent is used when calculating the terminal value. This is in line with Norges Bank's in/flation target. The utility value is calculated using a required rate of return of 6.8 per cent. The required rate of return is calculated based on the risk-free interest rate and added to a premium that re/flects the risk of the business.\n\nThere will be uncertainty related to the assumptions that have been made in the valuation. The value will be a/ffected by the assumptions for the interest rate margin, expected losses on lending, growth parameters and capital requirements, as well as what required rate of return is assumed, etc. It is noted that the aim of the calculations is to achieve a satisfactory level of certainty that the utility value, cf. IAS 36, is not lower than the value recognised in the accounts. Simulations with reasonable and also conservative assumptions indicate a value that justi/fies the book value.\n\n## Intangible assets linked to the acquisition of Skagen\n\nStorebrand Asset Management AS acquired Skagen AS in 2017. The intangible assets linked to Skagen are customer lists, branded products, technology and goodwill. Budgets and forecasts approved by the Board for the next three years are used as the basis for the valuation. For the period from 2027 to 2033, a growth rate in line with the equity market for the income and a constant ratio between income and expenses were used as a basis. A growth rate of 2.0 per cent is used when calculating the terminal value. This is in line with Norges Bank's in/flation target. The utility value is calculated using a required rate of return of 7.3 per cent.\n\nThere are uncertainty related to the assumptions that have been made in the valuation. The value will be in/fluenced by changes in the assumptions regarding expected returns of the /financial markets, costs, management fees, growth parameters, and the discount rate. The aim of the calculations is to achieve a satisfactory level of certainty that the entity speci/fic value, cf. IAS 36, is not lower than the value recognised in the accounts. Simulations with reasonable and also conservative assumptions indicate a value that justi/fies the book value.\n\n## Intangible assets linked to the acquisition of Cubera Private Equity\n\nStorebrand Asset Management AS acquired Cubera Private Equity AS in 2019. The intangible assets linked to Cubera are customer lists, customer relations and database over the private equity market. Budgets and forecasts approved by the Board for the next three years are used as the basis for the valuation. For the period from 2027 to 2033, a projected forecast has been used that is based on the expected development in the private equity market. A growth rate of 2.0 per cent is used when calculating the terminal value. This is in line with Norges Bank's in/flation target. The utility value is calculated using a required rate of return after tax of 7.3 per cent.",

The value will be in/fluenced by changes in the assumptions regarding expected returns of the /financial markets, costs, management fees, growth parameters, and the required rate of return that is used as the discount rate.

Simulations with reasonable and also conservative assumptions indicate a value that justi/fies the book value.\n\n## Intangible assets linked to the acquisition of Silver\n\nStorebrand Livsforsikring AS acquired Silver Pensjonsforsikring AS in 2018, the company was merged with Storebrand Livsforsikring AS in 2018. The intangible values linked to the purchase of Silver were the value of existing business (VIF -value of business in force). After the implementation of IFRS 17, VIF for the insurance contracts is no longer an intangible asset but part of the contractual service margin which, in the balance sheet, is part of insurance contract liabilities for guaranteed products.\n\n## Intangible assets related to the purchase of customer portfolio from Insr\n\nIn 2020, Storebrand Forsikring AS entered into an agreement to acquire a customer portfolio from Insr Insurance Group ASA. The policies were renewed in Storebrand's systems during 2020 and 2021, and the intangible asset was accrued based on actual renewals, cf. IAS 38. The customer portfolio from Insr is integrated into Storebrand's business and primarily Storebrand Forsikring AS and the Insurance segment. The recoverable amount is determined by calculating the utility value of the business. It is considered most accurate to estimate the value of the contracts that were acquired, despite these not being a separate cash generating unit. In order to determine whether there has been impairment that is less than the book values, the parameters used in the valuation and acquisition analysis are assessed. A comparison is also made with the development of expected values used in the valuation upon the entering into of the agreement to acquire the customer portfolio.\n\nThe utility value will be in/fluenced by the assumption of pro/fitability and claims ratio, customer loss, and the required rate of return that is used. Simulations with reasonable and also conservative assumptions indicate a value that justi/fies the book value.\n\n## Intangible assets related to the acquisition of Capital Investment\n\nStorebrand Asset Management AS acquired Capital Investment A/S (Capital Investment) in 2021. The intangible assets associated with Capital Investment are customer relations and goodwill. Budgets and forecasts approved by the Board for the next three years are used as the basis for the valuation. For the period from 2027 to 2033, a projected forecast has been used that is based on the expected development. A growth rate of 2.0 per cent is used when calculating the terminal value. This is in line with Danmarks Nationalbank's (central bank of Denmark) in/flation target. The utility value is calculated using a required rate of return after tax of 7.7 per cent.\n\nThere will be uncertainty related to the assumptions that have been made in the valuation. The value will be in/fluenced by the assumptions regarding expected returns in the /financial markets, costs, management fees, growth parameters, and the required rate of return that is used as a basis. The aim of the calculations is to achieve a satisfactory level of certainty that the utility value, cf. IAS 36, is not lower than the value recognised in the /financial statements. Simulations with reasonable and also conservative assumptions indicate a value that justi/fies the book value.\n\n## Intangible assets linked to the acquisition of Danica\n\nStorebrand Livsforsikring AS acquired Danica Pensjon AS (Danica) in 2022. Intangible assets related to the acquisition of Danica are customer relations, distribution agreements and goodwill. Budgets and forecasts approved by the Board for the next three years are used as the basis for the valuation. Based on the forecasts, a cash-/flow-based valuation has been performed. It is understood that all capital in excess of the regulatory-bound equity may be withdrawn at the end of each period.\n\nThere will be uncertainty related to the assumptions that have been made in the valuation. The utility value will be in/fluenced by the assumptions regarding expected returns in the /financial markets, costs, customer loss, income development and the required rate of return that is used as a basis. The aim of the calculations is to achieve a satisfactory level of certainty that the utility value, cf. IAS 36, is not lower than the value recognised in the /financial statements. Simulations with reasonable and also conservative assumptions indicate a value that justi/fies the book value.\n\n## Intangible assets linked to the acquisition of Kron\n\nStorebrand ASA acquired Kron AS (Kron) in 2023. Intangible assets related to the acquisition of Kron are customer relations, IT-systems, brand name and goodwill. Budgets and forecasts approved by the Board for the next three years are used as the basis for the valuation. Based on the forecasts, a cash-/flow-based valuation has been performed.  A growth rate of 2.0 per cent is used when calculating the terminal value. This is in line with Norges Bank's in/flation target. The utility value is calculated using a required rate of return after tax of 7.3 per cent.",

The Group has decided not to recognise leases when the underlying asset has a low value and therefore does not recognise lease liabilities and right-of-use assets for any of these leases. Instead, the lease payments are expensed as they are incurred. The Group also does not recognise lease liabilities and right-of-use assets for short-term leases of less than 12 months.\n\n## Depreciations lease agreements\n\nLease agreements for right-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n\nNon-discounted lease liabilities\n\n| NOK million                                    | 2023   | 2022   |\n|------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Year 1                                         | 148    | 154    |\n| Year 2                                         | 139    | 127    |\n| Year 3                                         | 138    | 123    |\n| Year 4                                         | 75     | 122    |\n| Year 5                                         | 11     | 63     |\n| After 5 years                                  | 719    | 578    |\n| Total non-discounted lease liabilities 31. 12. | 1,230  | 1,166  |",

For /fixed-income securities without observed market prices, the e/ffective interest rate is calculated on the basis of /fixed-interest periods and the classi/fication of the individual security with regard to liquidity and credit risk. The weighting to the average e/ffective interest rate for the total holdings is made using the individual security's share of total interest rate sensitivity as weights.\n\n|                                                                                                            | Stage 1      | Stage 1   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|-----------|\n| NOK million                                                                                                | 12-month ECL | Total     |\n| Loan loss provisions 01.01.2023                                                                            | -1           | -1        |\n| Loan loss provisions 31.12.23                                                                              | -1           | -1        |\n| Loan loss provisions on loans to customers valued at fair value through other comprehen- sive income (OCI) | -1           | -1        |\n| Total                                                                                                      | -1           | -1        |\n\n## Bonds at fair value\n\n|                                                                     | Fair value   | Fair value   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|\n| NOK million                                                         | 2023         | 2022         |\n| Government bonds                                                    | 62,768       | 54,717       |\n| Corporate bonds                                                     | 106,242      | 106,067      |\n| Structured notes                                                    | 14,055       | 14,292       |\n| Collateralised securities                                           | 5,731        | 4,506        |\n| Bond funds                                                          | 91,105       | 85,122       |\n| Total bonds and other /fixed-income securities                      | 279,900      | 264,704      |\n| Allocation by company and customers:                                |              |              |\n| Bonds and other /fixed-income securities - company                  | 25,983       | 23,516       |\n| Bonds and other /fixed-income securities - customers with guarantee | 253,916      | 241,187      |\n| Total                                                               | 279,900      | 264,704      |\n\n|                          | Fair value                 | Fair value                | Fair value       | Fair value            | Fair value      |\n|--------------------------|----------------------------|---------------------------|------------------|-----------------------|-----------------|\n|                          | Storebrand Life  Insurance | SPP  Pension &  Insurance | Storebrand  Bank | Storebrand  Insurance | Storebrand  ASA |\n| Modi/fied duration       | 4.7                        | 4.0                       | 0.2              | 0.3                   | 0.3             |\n| Average e/ffective yield | 3.1 %                      | 2.0 %                     | 4.9 %            | 5.4 %                 | 5.4 %           |\n\nFor individual /fixed-interest securities, the e/ffective rate is calculated based on the fair value (market value) of the security.

Ap/fiendix\n\n## Note 33: Derivatives\n\n## Nominal volume\n\nFinancial derivatives are related to underlying amounts which are not recognised in the statement of /financial position. In order to quantify the scope of the derivatives, reference is made to amounts described as the underlying nominal principal, nominal volume, etc. Nominal volume is arrived at di/fferently for di/fferent classes of derivatives, and provides some indication of the size of the position and risk the derivative presents.\n\nGross nominal volume principally indicates the size of the exposure, while net nominal volume provides some indication of the risk exposure. However , nominal volume is not a measure which necessarily provides a comparison of the risk represented by di/fferent types of derivatives. Unlike gross nominal volume, the calculation of net nominal volume also takes into account which direction of market risk exposure the instrument represents by di/fferentiating between long (asset) positions and short (liability) positions.\n\nA long position in an equity derivative produces a gain in value if the share price increases.  For interest rate derivatives, a long position produces a gain if interest rates fall, as is the case for bonds. For currency derivatives, a long position results in a positive change in value if the relevant exchange rate strengthens against the NOK. Average gross nominal volume are based on daily calculations of gross nominal volume.\n\n| NOK million                                  | Gross nominal  volume  1)   | Gross booked  value /fin. assets   | Gross booked  value /fin.  liabilities   | Net  amount    2023   | Net  amount    2022   |\n|----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|\n| Interest derivatives                         | 179,378                     | 2,595                              | 5,761                                    | -3,165                | -8,278                |\n| Currency derivatives                         | 180,625                     | 5,498                              | 358                                      | 5,140                 | 2,263                 |\n| Total derivater 31.12.                       |                             | 8,093                              | 6,118                                    | 1,975                 |                       |\n| Total derivater 31.12.22                     |                             |                                    |                                          |                       | -6,014                |\n| Distribution between company and  customers: |                             |                                    |                                          |                       |                       |\n| Derivatives - company                        |                             |                                    |                                          | 526                   | 249                   |\n| Derivatives - customers with guarantee       |                             |                                    |                                          | 1,448                 | -6,264                |\n| Total                                        |                             |                                    |                                          | 1,975                 | -6,014                |\n\n1) Values 31.12.\n\n## Note 34: Loans\n\n| NOK million                                                               | Booked  value              31.12.23   | Booked  value              31.12.22   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|\n| Loans to customers at amortised cost                                      | 423                                   | 484                                   |\n| Loans to customers at fair value through pro/fit and loss                 | 27,504                                | 28,269                                |\n| Loans to customers at fair value through other comprehensive income (OCI) | 58,928                                | 49,191                                |\n| Total gross loans to customers                                            | 86,854                                | 77,944                                |\n| Provision for expected loss stage 1                                       | -6                                    | -9                                    |\n| Provision for expected loss stage 2                                       | -21                                   | -19                                   |\n| Provision for expected loss stage 3                                       | -66                                   | -40                                   |\n| Net loans to customers                                                    | 86,761                                | 77,876                                |",

In order to reduce the interest rate risk on /fixed-rate borrowing, fair value hedging is used. The risk hedged under the interest rate risk policy is NIBOR. That is, own credit risk is not hedged by maintaining the credit spread constant as at establishment. Fair value  of the hedging object is hedged by entering into an interest rate swap, swaped from /fixed to /floating, in order to reduce the risk associated with future interest rate changes. The hedges satisfy the requirements for hedge accounting at the individual transaction level, in that a hedging instrument is directly linked to a secured object, and the hedging relationship is satisfactorily documented.",

Ap/fiendix\n\nAll hedging relationships are established with identical /fixed-rate pro/files; /fixed rate, principal, coupon maturity and principal maturity, both in the object and the instrument. The instrument swaps from /fixed rate to /floating rate quoted at Nibor 3 months. The hedging ratio is expected to be e/ffective by counteracting the e/ffect of changes in fair value as a result of changes in interest rates. Net recognised changes in the value of real value hedges are due to changes in value as a result of changes in market interest rates, i.e. hedged risk.\n\nEuro loans also include hedging of currency risk. The hedge is intended to eliminate the currency risk on the principal and provide an interest expense equal to the /floating NOK interest rate. The hedging instrument is a Basisswap where Storebrand Lifeinsurance AS receives 10-year /fixed EUR interest and pays /floating 3 months NIBOR. The /floating leg of the interest rate swap is denominated in NOK. In this way, the hedging instrument will also hedge against /fluctuations in the exchange rate.\n\nHedging e/ffectiveness is measured based on the simple Dollar O/ffset method with respect to prospective e/ffectiveness. The Storebrand Group has identi/fied the following sources of ine/fficiency\n\n- - di/fferent discount rate on instrument and object\n\nIn addition, /floating legs have a /fixed rate for three months at a time, and therefore also make a contribution to ine/fficiency. This contribution gradually falls towards zero over three months and then jumps to a new level determined by 3M NIBOR at the time of a new interest rate /fixing. The latter will have a limited e/ffect to three months.\n\nThese conditions are not expected to create material ine/fficiencies. No other sources of ine/fficiencies have been identi/fied during the /fiscal year. All hedging of interest rate risk is fair value hedging and any ine/fficiencies are recognised in the ordinary result under 'Net income from /financial and real estate investments'.\n\nHedging instrument/hedged item\n\n|                     | 2023   | 2023                       | 2022                           | 2022           | 2022           | 2022                       |\n|---------------------|--------|----------------------------|--------------------------------|----------------|----------------|----------------------------|\n|                     |        | Recognised                 |                                | Book value  1) | Book value  1) | Recognised                 |\n| NOK million         | Booked | of compre- hensive  income | Conract/ nominal  value (Euro) | Assets         | Liabilities    | of compre- hensive  income |\n| Interest rate swaps | -29    |                            | 38                             | 112            |                | -590                       |\n| Subordinated loans  | 28     | 3                          | -38                            |                | 421            | 578                        |\n\n- 1) Book values as at 31.12.\n\nThe loan has been repaid in April , and the hedging was therefore terminated.\n\n## Hedging instrument/hedged item\n\n|                     | 2023                  | 2023           | 2023   | 2022                  | 2022           | 2022   |\n|---------------------|-----------------------|----------------|--------|-----------------------|----------------|--------|\n|                     | Contract/             | Book value  1) |        | Conract/              | Book value  1) |        |\n| NOK million         | nominal value  (Euro) | Liabilities    | Booked | nominal  value (Euro) | Liabilities    | Booked |\n| Interest rate swaps | 300                   | 229            |        | 300                   | 648            |        |\n| Subordinated loans  | -300                  | 2,782          | -29    | -300                  | 2,397          | 28     |\n\n- 1) Book values as at 31.12.\n\n## Hedging instrument/hedged item\n\n|                     | 2023                  | 2023           | 2023           | 2023   | 2022                  | 2022           | 2022           |\n|---------------------|-----------------------|----------------|----------------|--------|-----------------------|----------------|----------------|\n|                     | Contract/             | Book value  1) | Book value  1) |        | Contract/             | Book value  1) | Book value  1) |\n| NOK million         | nominal  value  (NOK) | Assets         | Liabilities    | Booked | nominal  value  (NOK) | Assets         | Liabilities    |\n| Interest rate swaps | 750                   | 6              |                |        | 750                   | 16             |                |\n| Subordinated loans  | -750                  |                | 763            | -3     | -750                  |                | 773            |\n\n- 1) Book values as at 31.12.",

Three-month rolling currency derivatives have been used, where the spot element in these has been used as a hedging instrument. As of 31.12.23, four loans have been raised and used as a hedging instrument. The e/ffective share of hedging instruments is included in the other comprehensive income. The net investment in Storebrand Holding AB is partially hedging and the hedging e/fficiency is therefore expected to be around 100 per cent. No sources of ine/fficiencies in hedging net investment have been identi/fied. An income of NOK 739 million has been recorded in the total result related to hedging Storebrand Holding AB, compared with an income of NOK 226 million in 2022.\n\n## Hedging instrument/hedged item\n\n|                                 | 2023                           | 2023           | 2023           | 2022                 | 2022           | 2022           |\n|---------------------------------|--------------------------------|----------------|----------------|----------------------|----------------|----------------|\n|                                 |                                | Book value  1) | Book value  1) | Contract/            | Book value  1) | Book value  1) |\n| NOK million                     | Contract/ nominal  value (SEK) | Assets         | Liabilities    | nominal  value (SEK) | Assets         | Liabilities    |\n| Currency derivatives            | -9,681                         |                | 175            | -9,691               |                | -111           |\n| Loan used as hedging instrument | -3,200                         |                | 3,734          | -2,800               |                | 2,654          |\n| Underlying items                |                                | 10,961         |                |                      | 11,823         |                |\n\n- 1) Book values at 31.12.\n\nThe phasing out of LIBOR on various currencies as reference rates has received a minor attention throughout 2023. The transition to new 'overnight rates' has been demanding for many market participants, but the transition has gone better than many feared. From 1 January 2022, LIBOR for USD, GBP, EUR, CHF and JPY will be replaced by new 'interest rates', SOFR, SONIA, EurSTR, SARON and TONA. In 2023, value will still be quoted on some of the LIBOR interest rates, but from July 1th, there were no more publishing of LIBOR.\n\nFor Storebrand, the process of phasing out LIBOR interest rates has not been particularly demanding as exposure to LIBOR interest rates has been limited. Necessary adaptation of agreements related to EONIA in relation to certain counterparties has been implemented in Q4 2021. EONIA has been replaced by EurSTR and the stipulated 'fallbacks' which have resulted in a continuation of the values   based on EONIA. NIBOR and STIBOR, which have the greatest signi/ficance in the management of Storebrand's customer portfolios, will be continued for the time being. The same applies to EURIBOR. Storebrand secures an exposure in the reference rate EURIBOR 3M in one currency swap EUR / NOK which has a total nominal amount of EUR 300 million.",

Ap/fiendix\n\n## Note 1: Accounting policies\n\nStorebrand ASA is the holding company of the Storebrand Group. The Storebrand Group is engaged in life and P&C insurance, banking and asset management, with insurance being the primary business. The /financial statements of Storebrand ASA have accordingly been prepared in accordance with the Norwegian Accounting Act, generally accepted accounting policies in Norway, and the Norwegian Regulations relating to annual accounts for nonlife insurance companies. Storebrand ASA has used the simpli/fied IFRS provisions in the regulations for recognition and measurement.\n\n## Use of estimates and discretionary assumptions\n\nIn preparing the annual /financial statements, Storebrand has made assumptions and used estimates that a/ffect the reported value of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs, as well as the information provided on contingent liabilities. Future events may cause these estimates to change. Such changes will be recognised in the /financial statements when there is a su/fficient basis for using new estimates. The most important estimates and assessments are related to the valuation of the company's subsidiaries and the assumptions used for pension calculations.\n\n## Classi/fication and valuation policies\n\nAssets intended for permanent ownership and use are classi/fied as /fixed assets, and assets and receivables due for payment within one year are classi/fied as current assets. Equivalent policies have been applied to liability items.\n\n## Pro/fit and loss account and statement of /financial position\n\nStorebrand ASA is a holding company with subsidiaries in the /fields of insurance, banking and asset management. The layout plan in the Regulations relating to annual /financial statements for nonlife insurance companies has not been used, a custom layout plan has been used.\n\n## Investments in subsidiaries, dividends and group contributions\n\nIn the company's accounts, investments in subsidiaries and associated companies are valued at the acquisition cost less any write-downs. The need to write down is assessed at the end of each accounting period. Storebrand ASA's primary income is the return on capital invested in subsidiaries. Group contributions and dividends received in respect of these investments are therefore recorded as ordinary operating income. Proposed and approved dividends and group contributions from subsidiaries at the end of the year are recognised in the /financial statements of Storebrand ASA as income in that /financial year.\n\nA prerequisite for recognition is that this is earned equity by a subsidiary. Otherwise, this is recognised as an equity transaction, which means that the ownership interest in the subsidiary is reduced by dividends or group contributions.\n\n## Tangible /fixed assets\n\nTangible /fixed assets for own use are recognised at acquisition cost less accumulated depreciation. Write-downs are made if the book value exceeds the recoverable amount of the asset.\n\n## Pension liabilities for company's own employees\n\nStorebrand ASA have de/fined-contribution pension but have some pension obligation that are recorded as de/fined-bene/fit pension.\n\nThe de/fined-contribution pension scheme involves the company paying an annual contribution to the employees' collective pension savings. The future pension will depend upon the size of the contribution and the annual return on the pension savings. The company does not have any further work-related obligations after the annual contribution has been paid. No provisions are made for ongoing pension liabilities for these types of schemes. De/fined-contribution pension schemes are recognised directly in the /financial statements.\n\n## Tax\n\nThe tax cost in the pro/fit and loss account consists of tax payable and changes in deferred tax. Deferred tax and deferred tax assets are calculated on the di/fferences between accounting and tax values of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets are recorded on the balance sheet to the extent it is considered likely that the company will have su/fficient taxable pro/fit in the future to make use of the tax asset. Deferred tax is applied directly against equity to the extent that it relates to items that are themselves directly applied against equity.\n\n## Currency\n\nCurrent assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Shares held as /fixed assets are translated at the exchange rate on the date of acquisition.",

Ap/fiendix\n\n## Financial instruments\n\n## Recognition and derecognition\n\nFinancial assets and liabilities are recognised in the balance sheet when Storebrand ASA becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. Ordinary purchases and sales of /financial instruments are recognised on the date of the transaction. When a /financial asset or /financial liability is /first recognized, it is measured at fair value. The initial recognition includes transaction expenses that are directly attributable at the time of acquisition or issuance of the /financial asset/liability, in cases where the /financial asset/liability is not measured at fair value above net income.\n\nFinancial assets are set o/ff when the contractual rights to the cash /flows from the /financial asset expire, or when the entity transfers the /financial asset in a transaction in which all or approximately all risk and pro/fit opportunities associated with ownership of the asset are transferred.\n\nFinancial obligations are set o/ff from the balance sheet when they have ceased - that is, when the obligation speci/fied in the contract is ful/filled, canceled or expired.\n\n## Financial assets at fair value above net income\n\nFinancial assets at fair value above net income are measured at fair value on the balance sheet date. Changes in fair value are recognised in the result.\n\nAny repurchase of own shares is dealt with as an equity transaction, and own shares (treasury stock) are presented as a reduction in equity.\n\n## Bond funding\n\nBond loans are recorded at amortised cost using the e/ffective interest rate method. The amortised cost includes the transaction costs on the date of issue.\n\n## Note 2:  Income from investments in subsidiaries\n\n| NOK million                    | 2023   | 2022   |\n|--------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Storebrand Livsforsikring AS   | 3,439  | 2,325  |\n| Storebrand Bank ASA            | 395    | 208    |\n| Storebrand Asset Management AS | 627    | 510    |\n| Storebrand Forsikring AS       |        | 134    |\n| Storebrand Facilities AS       | 4      | 1      |\n| Storebrand Helseforsikring AS  |        | 9      |\n| Total                          | 4,465  | 3,187  |\n\nGroup contribution from Storebrand ASA, see note 8\n\n## Note 3: Net income for various classes of /financial instruments\n\n| NOK million                                               | Dividend/    interest  income   | Net gain/ loss on  realisation   |   Net  unrealised  gain/loss |   2023 |   2022 |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|----------------------------------|------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Net income from equities and units                        |                                 |                                  |                           -9 |     -9 |    -25 |\n| Net income from bonds and other /fixed income securities  | 86                              | 57                               |                           43 |    186 |     51 |\n| Net income and gains from /financial assets at fair value | 86                              | 57                               |                           34 |    177 |     26 |\n| - of which FVO (Fair Value Option)                        | 86                              | 57                               |                           34 |    177 |     26 |",

The company's pension schemes meet the requirements of the law.\n\nStorebrand  Group has country-speci/fic pension schemes.\n\nStorebrand's employees in Norway have a de/fined-contribution pension scheme. In a de/fined-contribution scheme, the company allocates an agreed contribution to a pension account. The future pension depends upon the amount of the contributions and the return on the pension account.  When the contributions have been paid, the company has no further payment obligations relating to the de/fined-contribution pension and the payment to the pension account is charged as an expense on an ongoing basis. For regulatory reasons, there can be no savings in the de/fined-contribution pension for salaries that exceed 12G (G = National Insurance Scheme basic amount). Storebrand has pension savings in the savings product Extra Pension for employees with salaries exceeding 12G.\n\nThe premiums and content of the de/fined-contribution pension scheme are as follows:\n\n- - Saving starts from the /first krone of salary\n- - Savings rate of 7 per cent of salary from 0 to 12 G (the National Insurance basic amount 'G' was NOK 118,620 as at 31 December 2023)\n- - In addition, 13 per cent of salary between 7.1 and 12 G is saved\n- - Savings rate for salary over 12 G is 20 per cent\n\nThe Norwegian companies participate in the Joint Scheme for Collective Agreement Pensions (AFP). The private AFP scheme provides a lifelong supplement to an ordinary pension and is a multi-employer pension scheme, but there is no reliable information available for inclusion of this liability on the statement of /financial position. The scheme is /financed by means of an annual premium that is de/fined as a percentage of salaries from 1 G to 7.1 G, and the premium rate was 2.6 % in 2023 and increases to 2,7 % in 2024.\n\nReconsiliation of pension assets and liabilities in the statement of /financial position\n\n| NOK million                                                     |   2023 |   2022 |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Present value of insured pension bene/fit liabilities           |      1 |      1 |\n| Pension assets at fair value                                    |     -7 |     -7 |\n| Net pension liabilities/assets for the insured schemes          |     -6 |     -6 |\n| Present value of the uninsured pension liabilities              |    117 |    123 |\n| Net pension liabilities in the statement of /financial position |    111 |    118 |",

Long-term assumptions such as future in/flation, real interest rates, real wage growth and adjustment of the basic amount are subject to a particularly high degree of uncertainty.\n\nIn Norway, a discount rate based on covered bonds is used. Based on the market and volume trends observed, the Norwegian covered bond market must be perceived as a deep market.\n\nSpeci/fic company conditions including expected direct wage growth are taken into account when determining the /financial assumptions.\n\n## Actuarial assumptions:\n\nIn Norway standardised assumptions on rates of mortality and disability as well as other demographic factors are prepared by Finance Norway. With e/ffect from 2014 a new mortality basis, K2013, has been introduced for group pension insurance in life insurance companies and pension funds. Storebrand has used the mortality table K2013BE (best estimate) in the actuarial calculations at 31 December 2023.",

With the exception of the introduction of IFRS 17, there have been no regulatory changes, transactions or events of significant importance for the 2023 annual accounts that have derived new focus areas. As a result of developments in the cases relating to the uncertain tax positions, this area has not had the same attention this year.\n\n| Key Audit Matters                       | How our audit addressed the Key Audit Matter   |\n|-----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|\n| Valuation of life insurance liabilities |                                                |\n\nWe focused on the valuation of the insurance liabilities because it is significant estimates in the financial statements. The estimates involves complex assessment concerning the probability that insured events occurs, and uncertainty related to whether the provisions are sufficient to cover the total liabilities to the policyholders. Small adjustments of the assumptions may have significant impact on the estimates.\n\nThe calculation of the insurance liabilities will to a large extent depend on quality of data in the insurance system and use of assumptions that are in accordance with the accounting rules in IFRS 17. See notes 1, 2, 7 and 37 to the consolidated accounts where the management gives a more detailed description of the insurance liabilities, assumptions and estimation uncertainty.\n\nImplementation of IFRS 17\n\nThe group has implemented the new accounting standard for insurance contracts IFRS 17 with effect from the financial year 2023. This represents a significant change in accounting practice. Among other things, the standard introduces new models for measurement, presentation and notes to the financial statements. Given the complexity and judgment involved in the application of the new standard, and the significant impact it has on the Group's accounts and processes, we focused on\n\nIn our audit we have considered and tested the design and effectiveness of established controls for review of used assumptions and calculation methods, including the company's internal recalculations of the insurance liabilities. We also examined whether management had established effective controls that ensured data quality for the calculation of the insurance liabilities. This included controls related to data collection, data processing, reconciliation of the insurance systems and IT General Controls relevant for financial reporting. Those controls we elected to base our audit on, was working efficiently.\n\nWe also performed independent calculations for a selection of insurance obligations using our internal actuarial models and compared these with the company's calculations. We used our internal actuaries for this work. The comparison did not indicate any deviations of significance.\n\nWe considered and challenged management's use of key assumptions that the estimated insurance liabilities are based on. We did the same for the method and the models the management used. We used our own internal actuaries for parts of this work.\n\nWe also considered and found that the information regarding the insurance liabilities in notes to the financial statements is sufficient and adequate, and that the information satisfies the requirements of the accounting rules.\n\nIn our audit of the implementation of IFRS 17, we have, among other things, carried out the following audit actions:\n\n- \u00b7 Gained an understanding of the company's process for implementing IFRS 17, including the changes in systems and processes the company has carried out, and how the management has interpreted and applied the new accounting rules.",

For a more detailed description of the effects and management's assessments when implementing IFRS 17, we refer to notes 1 and 2 in the consolidated accounts.\n\nValuation of investment Properties\n\nThe group has investment properties that mainly consists of office and retail properties. We have focused on investment property because it represents an estimate and a substantial part of the assets in the Group's statement of financial position.\n\nValuation of the properties involves use of assumptions which are subject to management judgement. Important assumptions for the value of individual properties are primarily expected future cash flows and discount rate.\n\nThe basis for management's e stimate is an internal valuation model and external valuations. Management obtain observations of market data from various market participants. Management considers reasonableness of their own estimates through obtaining valuations from external valuers for a sample of properties on a continuing basis. The valuers were engaged by management.\n\nRefer to note 1, 2, 12 and 35 in the financial statements for management's further description of investment properties, the methods used and the assumptions the valuations are based on.\n\n- \u00b7 Assessed management's application of new accounting principles, assumptions and methods, including management judgement. The assessments included, among other things, the determination of the implementation effect as well as the application of methods for recognition and measurement principles for the various insurance contracts.\n- \u00b7 Assessed and tested the design and effectiveness of the controls implemented by management in connection with the transition and subsequent measurement of insurance contracts. Our testing included controls related to, among other things, data collection, calculations and the application of assumptions and methods.\n\nWhere relevant, we have used our own experts in this work. We did not detect any material deviations as a result of our audit procedures. Based on our performed audit procedures, we assessed and also came to the conclusion that the notes to the financial statements regarding the implementation effect of IFRS 17 is sufficient and adequate.\n\nThrough our audit we have assessed and tested design and effectiveness of established controls for review of applied assumptions and calculation methods, including the company's internal valuation of investment properties. We found that routines to ensure that these elements regularly were checked against both external valuations and marked data was established. Those controls that we elected to base our audit on, was in our view working efficiently.\n\nWe obtained, read through and understood the internal valuation model. We concluded that the model contains the elements required by the financial reporting framework and therefore is appropriate as a basis for determining fair value on the Group's investment properties. We tested whether, and concluded that the model made mathematically correct calculations.\n\nIn our assessment of the valuation, we challenged the assumptions for expected future cash flows and discount rate by comparing a sample of properties against information from relevant internal and external sources. We concluded that assumptions were consistent with information from relevant sources.",

Routines and processes that ensures an accurate basis for the valuation is important for these assets. For financial assets that is measured based on models and certain assumptions that is not observable, we focused on assessing both the models and the assumptions underlying the valuation.\n\nRefer to note 1, 2 and 12 in the financial statements for a further description of management's valuation of financial assets measured at fair value\n\nWe compared the internal value determinations against the external valuers' estimates of values for selected properties. We challenged the management on significant deviations and obtained explanations for deviations. We considered the explanations to be reasonable. We also assessed the external valuers' qualifications, competence and objectivity.\n\nWe also assessed and concluded that the information about investment properties in the notes to the financial statements were in accordance with the accounting principles and provides an adequate description of the method and the underlying assumptions that is used for the valuation.\n\nIn our audit we considered design and tested effectiveness of established controls over valuation of financial assets measured at fair value. Particularly we focused on those controls that ensured complete and accurate use of quoted market prices and other observable masterdata, return on investments controls and IT General Controls relevant for financial reporting. Those controls that we elected to base our audit on, was in our view working efficiently.\n\nFor financial assets measured through use of models and assumptions that are not observable, we assessed valuation principles, the models and assumptions that were used. We found that the models and assumptions were reasonable and used consistently.\n\nFor a sample of investments, we also tested that fair value was in accordance with external sources. We considered the reliability of the sources of information, when relevant. Our tests did not reveal substantial deviations.\n\nWe also assessed and found that the information in the notes regarding the Group's valuation principles and fair value determination were sufficient and adequate.\n\n## Other Information\n\nThe Board of Directors and the Managing Director (management) are responsible for the information in the Board of Directors' report and the other information accompanying the financia l statements. The other information comprises information in the annual report, but does not include the financial statements and",

Appendix\n\nour auditor's report thereon. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the information in the Board of Directors ' report nor the other information accompanying the financial statements.\n\nIn connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the Board of Directors' report and the other information accompanying the financial statements. The purpose is to consider if there is material inconsistency between the Board of Directors' report and the other information accompanying the financial statements and the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or whether the Board of Directors' report and the other information accompanying the financial statements otherwise appears to be materially misstated. We are required to report if there is a material misstatement in the Board of Directors' report or the other information acc ompanying the financial statements. We have nothing to report in this regard.\n\nBased on our knowledge obtained in the audit, it is our opinion that the Board of Directors' report\n\n- \u00b7 is consistent with the financial statements and\n- \u00b7 contains the information required by applicable statutory requirements.\n\nOur opinion on the Board of Director's report applies correspondingly to the statements on Corporate Governance and Corporate Social Responsibility.\n\n## Responsibilities of Management for the Financial Statements\n\nManagement is responsible for the preparation of financial statements of the Company that give a true and fair view in accordance with the Norwegian Accounting Act and accounting standards and practices generally accepted in Norway, and for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements of the Group that give a true and fair view in accordance with IFRS Accounting Standards as adopted by the EU. Management is responsible for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company's and the Group's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern. The financial statements of the Company use the going concern basis of accounting insofar as it is not likely that the enterprise will cease operations. The consolidated financial statements of the Group use the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\n## Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with ISAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n\n- \u00b7 identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. We design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- \u00b7 obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the",

If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company and the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.\n- \u00b7 evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves a true and fair view.\n- \u00b7 obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.\n\nWe communicate with the Board of Directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.\n\nWe also provide the Audit Committee with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, actions taken to eliminate threats or safeguards applied.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with the Board of Directors, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\n\n## Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements\n\nReport on Compliance with Requirement on European Single Electronic Format (ESEF)\n\n## Opinion\n\nAs part of the audit of the financial statements of Storebrand ASA, we have performed an assurance engagement to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements included in the annual report, with the file name storebrandasa-2023-12-31-nb.zip, have been prepared, in all material respects, in compliance with the requirements of the Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/815 on the European Single Electronic Format (ESEF Regulation) and regulation pursuant to Section 5-5 of the Norwegian Securities Trading Act, which includes requirements related to the preparation of the annual report in XHTML format, and iXBRL tagging of the consolidated financial statements.",
