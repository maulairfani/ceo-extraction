It is a privilege to provide reliable energy to millions of homes and businesses every day and make a strong contribution to communities.\n\nWe've come a long way, but we've got a long way to go. Energy generation is changing rapidly as the energy transition accelerates. And with this, the needs and preferences of our customers are changing. Our communities need our support as much as ever.\n\nWe're a company that embraces opportunities and leans into challenges. And that's how we create value.",

This has accelerated our ambition to deliver superior customer service at lower cost and differentiate Origin.\n\nContributing to communities and creating a lasting impact has always been important.

The proposal confirmed that Origin represents a highly strategic platform and one ideally positioned to benefit from the energy transition.\n\nIn March this year, Origin announced it had entered into a binding Scheme Implementation Deed with the Consortium, which implies a total consideration of $8.912 per share prior to dividend adjustments, based on an assumed AUD/USD exchange rate of 0.70. 1\n\nThe proposed acquisition of Origin by the Consortium continues to progress through the necessary regulatory steps.\n\nThe scheme and the Board's recommendation is subject to an independent expert concluding the scheme is in the best interests of shareholders. The independent expert process is underway.\n\nWhile the timing of the shareholder vote is uncertain as it relates to the timing of regulatory approvals, Origin and the Consortium are moving expeditiously towards the target to implement the scheme by early in the 2024 calendar year.\n\n## Financial performance\n\nOrigin's FY2023 financial performance reflected the strength of our business and the continued strategy. We recorded higher earnings from Energy Markets, Integrated Gas and from our 20 per cent interest in the UK-based Octopus Energy.\n\nOn a statutory basis, Origin announced a profit of $1,055 million, compared to a loss of $1,429 million in the prior year.\n\nUnderlying profit increased to $747 million, $340 million higher than the previous year due to improved earnings across all our operations. These earnings were partly offset by higher income tax expense associated with unfranked distributions from Australia Pacific LNG.\n\nOrigin benefited from record revenues and cash dividends from Australia Pacific LNG of $1,783 million, as a result of higher commodity prices. Net of oil hedging, Origin received cash distributions of $1,489 million. This distribution contributed to a strong adjusted free cash flow position of $965 million.\n\nThe Board has determined a fully franked final dividend of 20 cents per share. For the FY2023 year, shareholders will have received total dividends of 36.5 cents per share.",

        "page_content": "## Operational performance\n\nUnderlying EBITDA for Energy Markets was $1,038 million, up $637 million on the prior year. Electricity profit rose as higher wholesale energy costs in previous periods were recovered in electricity tariffs, and through optimisation of the energy supply portfolio. Natural gas profit also rose, on higher sales revenue and trading benefits.\n\nTotal customer accounts increased by 66,000 to 4.5 million primarily driven by growth in electricity, natural gas and broadband. The migration of customers to Kraken completed in May and stabilisation activities continue. Origin is expecting to deliver cost savings of $200 - $250 million from an FY2018 baseline, by 2025.\n\nOrigin Zero doubled its share of business customers on solutions broader than electricity or natural gas, providing rooftop solar, batteries, electric vehicles and demand management. The team secured several key account wins, including a leading grocery retailer, a water utility and a data centre operator. Origin Loop, the company's virtual power plant, more than tripled connected assets to 815 MW and is well on its way to achieve our target of 2 GW.\n\nOrigin's share of Octopus Energy (UK) Underlying EBITDA was $240 million, up from a loss of $36 million in the prior year. Octopus' step change in earnings in FY2023 reflects an increase in customer accounts and the lag in the reset of tariffs. The acquisition of Bulb Energy added ~2.5 million customer accounts, making Octopus Energy the UK's second-largest energy retailer, with continued growth in the licensing of Kraken to other retailers resulting in 32 million accounts contracted to be on the platform worldwide.\n\nIntegrated Gas Underlying EBITDA was $1,919 million, $82 million higher than the prior year, mainly due to higher commodity prices. Persistent wet weather restricted access to well sites in the first half, contributing to a 3 per cent decline in production for the year. Improved conditions in the second half allowed more well workover and optimisation activities to occur, enabling a rebound in production in the second half.\n\n## Outlook\n\nThe following guidance is provided on the basis that market conditions and the regulatory environment do not materially change.\n\nOrigin expects higher Energy Markets Underlying EBITDA in FY2024 of $1,300 - $1,700 million, excluding Octopus Energy. Electricity gross profit is expected to improve, reflecting higher tariffs and an increased contribution from Eraring and the peaking fleet, while natural gas gross profit is expected to moderate due to higher procurement costs as supply contracts reprice.\n\nOctopus is in a rapid growth phase and continues to invest in international growth, technology platform developments and services offerings. Origin's share of Octopus Energy EBITDA is expected to be lower with a wide range of possible outcomes reflecting stronger retail competition.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAustralia Pacific LNG production is expected to be 680 - 710 PJ (APLNG 100 per cent), with higher capital and operating expenditure expected, primarily due to higher power costs, increased well workover and optimisation programs.\n\n## Our strategy, people and Board\n\nOver the past year, execution of Origin's strategy has accelerated leading to increasing confidence as to our future prospects as the energy transition gathers momentum. We are rapidly building our pipeline of renewable and storage projects. We approved the first phase of a large-scale Eraring battery, acquired the Warrane prospective wind development site in the New England renewable energy zone and progressed several renewable and brownfield battery development options across the portfolio.\n\nWe released our first Climate Transition Action Plan (CTAP) outlining the company's strategy and ambition to lead the energy transition through cleaner energy and customer solutions. The CTAP includes new targets to accelerate emissions reduction across Origin and create value for shareholders, towards a long-term ambition to be net zero emissions by 2050. Our CTAP received overwhelming shareholder support of ~95 per cent at our 2022 Annual General Meeting.\n\nThis year's achievements are in no small part due to the dedication and commitment of the people who embody the culture and values of Origin every day. This past year, our safety performance improved with our Total Recordable Injury Frequency Rate (TRIFR) lowering to 3.8, compared to 4.0 at June 2022. Our employee engagement score was 7.7, placing us above the industry average, and the number of females in senior leader positions increased to 46 per cent, from 40.8 per cent in FY2022.\n\nWe would like to acknowledge the service of Bruce Morgan, who retired from the Origin Board in October, after 10 years of dedicated service. Bruce has made a lasting contribution to Origin over his time as a director.\n\nWe are pleased with Origin's strong operational and financial performance this year. We remain confident that our customer base, portfolio of assets and management team position Origin advantageously as the energy transition progresses. This will allow us to capture value for shareholders and deliver benefits to our customers and communities.\n\nThank you, and we look forward to welcoming you to the Annual General Meeting.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nScott Perkins Chairman\n\nFrank Calabria\n\nChief Executive Officer",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\n## Operating and Financial Review\n\n## For the full year ended 30 June 2023\n\nThis report forms part of the Directors' Report.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 1 Market Context and Outlook\n\n## Market context\n\nOver the past 18 months, there has been unprecedented disruption and volatility in global and domestic energy markets. The transition to a low carbon future is bringing significant change and challenges to energy companies and consumers. Russia's invasion of Ukraine exacerbated this volatility by restricting global energy supplies and constraining supply chains resulting in a spike in global energy costs.\n\nThese global events combined with local factors including coal plant constraints due to outages and flooding which restricted coal supply to power stations, contributed to severe wholesale price spikes into the early part of FY2023. The structure of the regulated mass market tariff regime in Australia meant energy retailers were locked into customer tariffs set at prices substantially below wholesale procurement prices. As regulated tariffs adjust annually to reflect market prices, retailers suffered a period of depressed margins and significant cash flow volatility, with some smaller retailers going into administration. Regulators responded by intervening in coal and gas markets seeking to lower electricity prices for consumers.\n\nOrigin's Energy Markets' first half FY2023 earnings were adversely impacted by higher fuel costs and higher levels of energy price volatility. In the second half of FY2023, Energy Markets earnings began to recover as wholesale prices declined from their peak as coal deliveries recovered and coal costs declined following the government's introduction of the coal price cap. During FY2023 mass market tariffs did not fully recover the wholesale cost of energy. Origin expects tariffs to more closely reflect wholesale prices in the future.\n\nAt APLNG, higher global oil prices resulted in record revenue during the period.\n\nOur assets performed well during this period and our focus was to continue to reliably meet the energy needs of our domestic and offshore customers.\n\nThe Australian economy experienced significant inflation during FY2023. Households faced higher interest rates and higher prices, including energy costs. Origin recognises the financial pressure some of our customers are experiencing and provided around $30 million in bill relief and pricing support to our most vulnerable customers, including holding prices flat for customers who are on the Power On program. We are targeting further support for customers in hardship in FY2024.\n\nThe energy transition is both a great challenge and opportunity for society. For Australia to successfully transition to a lower carbon energy system, policy reform is required to both ensure the current emissions-intensive energy system performs reliably for as long as needed, and to encourage new investment in the cleaner energy infrastructure needed to replace it. As many of the nation's ageing coal fired power stations approach the end of their economic and technical lives, significant investment in transmission infrastructure and firming generation is required to support reliable power supply under all future scenarios. Investors will require both a stable policy environment and adequate financial returns if they are to invest the significant capital to the build the required infrastructure.\n\nThe energy transition presents many opportunities for Origin, and the company is well placed to compete and grow in this environment. Over the last year we have taken a final investment decision on a major battery as part of our plan to exit coal fired generation, and we have also expanded and matured our renewable and battery investment opportunities. As more renewable energy enters the Australian energy system to replace an ageing coal fired fleet, we see more opportunity for our gas peaking generation fleet to supply reliable power to support the variability in renewable supply. Our early-stage investments in green hydrogen are progressing and being met with strong customer interest and we believe hydrogen could play a role in the future energy mix, particularly as a substitute for gas in hard to abate sectors.\n\n## Consortium proposal update\n\nIn March 2023, Origin entered into a binding Scheme Implementation Deed with a consortium of investors to acquire all of the shares of the company with a consideration mix comprising $5.78 per share and US$2.19 per share (Scheme). Based on an assumed AUD/USD exchange rate of 0.70, this implies a total consideration of $8.912 per share. The total consideration payable will be reduced by any dividends paid by Origin prior to implementation of the Scheme, including the interim 16.5 cents per share fully franked dividend paid to shareholders on 24 March 2023 and the 20 cents per share final dividend determined by the Board to be paid 29 September 2023. Any reduction in the amount payable to shareholders due to the payment of dividends would reduce the Australian dollar component of the total consideration.\n\nA 4.5 cents per share per month ticking fee, accruing on a daily basis, will be added to the total consideration payable per share to shareholders if implementation of the Scheme is delayed beyond 30 November 2023.\n\nThe Scheme is conditional upon the satisfaction of certain conditions, including:\n\n- \u00b7 Origin shareholders approving the Scheme at a meeting of shareholders (Scheme Meeting);\n- \u00b7 court and regulatory approvals including the Foreign Investment Review Board (FIRB), the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC), the National Offshore Petroleum Titles Administrator and certain other foreign investment approvals;\n- \u00b7 the issue of an Independent Expert's Report that concludes that the Scheme is in the best interests of Origin shareholders; and\n- \u00b7 customary other conditions, including that no material adverse change occurs prior to implementation.\n\nAt this stage, shareholders do not need to take any action and Origin will continue to keep shareholders updated in accordance with its continuous disclosure obligations.",

Our focus is on delivering great customer experiences and striving to provide affordable, more sustainable and smarter energy solutions. In FY2023, we:\n\n- \u00b7 successfully completed the migration of all mass-market electricity and gas customers to our customer service platform, Kraken, licensed through our partnership with Octopus Energy\n- \u00b7 achieved a Customer Happiness Index - new customer interaction satisfaction metric, measured as the proportion of satisfied customers over the prior 12 months - score of 65 per cent;\n- \u00b7 experienced a decline in our strategic net promoter score reflecting a general shift in attitudes towards the energy industry in response to cost of living pressures and higher energy prices;\n- \u00b7 supported residential and small business customers in financial distress due to flooding and increasing cost-of-living pressures;\n- \u00b7 developed new community partnerships to help affected customers and communities transition out of crisis into recovery;\n- \u00b7 supported the domestic east coast gas market through our APLNG business;\n- \u00b7 launched several new e-mobility solutions, and had more than 400 electric vehicles under management at June 2023; and\n- \u00b7 grew our GreenPower electricity sales volumes by nine per cent to 533 GWh, driven by growth in large business customers.\n\n## Getting energy right for our communities\n\nWe aim to work responsibly and respectfully with our local communities and identify opportunities for Origin and our employees to make a positive difference.\n\nWe spent $421 million directly and indirectly with regional suppliers, or 20 per cent of our total spend, up from $318 million in FY2022.\n\nOur new Stretch Reconciliation Action Plan (Stretch RAP) includes a commitment to increase the participation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander businesses in Origin's supply chain. In FY2023, our spend with Indigenous suppliers was up $7 million to $24 million.\n\nThrough grants, 7,000 hours of employee volunteering, and our workplace giving program, the Origin Energy Foundation contributed over $2.1 million to the community in FY2023. The Foundation's volunteering program was awarded gold in the Best Pro Bono/Workplace Volunteering category of the 2022 Australian Workplace Giving Awards.\n\nDuring FY2023 the first round of applications commenced for the $5 million Eraring community fund we established in 2022.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Customers\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n65%\n\nCustomer Happiness Index\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Communities\n\nIndigenous supplier spend, direct and indirect spend ($m)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nContributed to the community by the Origin Energy Foundation",

The CTAP detailed our updated targets across Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions to accelerate emissions reduction across our business and included our long-term ambition to achieve net zero Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions by 2050.\n\nOur CTAP was put to a non-binding shareholder advisory vote at our Annual General Meeting in October 2022. We received strong shareholder support, with 94.5 per cent of votes cast in favour of the CTAP.\n\n## During FY2023,\n\n- \u00b7 we achieved our short-term equity emissions target, with cumulative reduction of 9 mt CO2-e between FY2021 and FY2023, against our FY2017 baseline;\n- \u00b7 total Scope 1 and 2 equity emissions increased by four per cent in FY2023, as improved coal supply enabled increased generation output from Eraring to support the needs of the market;\n- \u00b7 a final investment decision was taken on the 460 MW first stage of a battery at Eraring;\n- \u00b7 we acquired a property in the New England REZ for potential wind development, and established a joint venture for Gippsland offshore wind opportunities;\n- \u00b7 a Front-End Engineering Design decision was made for the Hunter Valley Hydrogen Hub, and we participated in a hydrogen-powered bus trial on the NSW Central Coast; and\n- \u00b7 our virtual power plant (VPP) grew to 815 MW across more than 276,000 connected services, up from 258 MW at the end of FY2022.\n\n## Our people\n\nOur people are one of our greatest strengths, and having a diverse and inclusive workplace is key to the success of our business. During FY2023, we:\n\n- \u00b7 improved safety performance with TRIFR declining from 4.0 in FY2022 to 3.8;\n- \u00b7 experienced an increase in Tier 1 and Tier 2 process safety incidents to 7, up from 2 in FY2022;\n- \u00b7 maintained 40% female representation in the three of our four leadership cohorts;\n- \u00b7 ranked 73 globally for gender equality in the Equileap Gender Equality Global Report & Ranking;\n- \u00b7 achieved an employee engagement score of 7.7 (out of 10), which is above the sector average;\n- \u00b7 launched our latest Stretch Reconciliation Action Plan; and\n- \u00b7 expanded our inclusion strategy to include three new pillars - life stages, cultural diversity and accessibility - in addition to gender equity, reconciliation and our LGBTQ colleagues.\n\nIn 2021, Origin became a signatory to 40:40 Vision , an investor-led initiative targeting gender balance in executive leadership by 2030. This year we achieved 46% of women in senior leadership roles 1 .\n\nWe continue to focus on supporting the mental health and wellbeing of our people and to develop a range of resources and programs through our online Mental Health and Wellbeing Hub.",

Earnings from Integrated Gas increased despite the sale of 10 per cent of APLNG during the prior period.\n\nEnergy Markets' Underlying EBITDA increased by $637 million to $1,038 million. This reflected the strong performance of our portfolio as the extreme market conditions of FY2022 eased, and the higher wholesale cost of energy flowing into customer tariffs. Our retail business performed strongly - we increased customer numbers, and recorded significant growth in our Community Energy Services business. All mass market electricity and natural gas customers have been successfully migrated to the Kraken platform. We continue to focus on growing our portfolio of renewables and our cleaner energy projects, commencing early works on the first stage of the Eraring battery and progressing other renewable and storage projects, and growing our Origin Zero business.\n\nAPLNG continued to deliver strong cash flow in challenging operating conditions with the three year La Ni\u00f1a weather cycle restricting access to well sites during H1 FY2023, affecting production. APLNG benefited from a rebound in production in 2H FY2023 following drier weather and high global oil and LNG prices.\n\nOrigin's share of Octopus Energy EBITDA increased to $240 million, reflecting an increase in customer accounts and the lag in reset of regulated tariffs in the UK retail business. The result includes a six month contribution from Bulb Energy earnings following the December 2022 acquisition, which added ~2.5 million customer accounts. See to Review of segment operations (see section 6) for further details.\n\nAdjusted Free Cash Flow was down $97 million to $965 million, driven by record cash distributions from APLNG of $1,783 million and lower cash flow from Energy Markets, with higher earnings more than offset by a higher working capital movement of $771 million reflecting a moderating working capital position following the extreme wholesale price environment of late FY2022. Origin continues to invest in growth initiatives, with $253 million spent on topping up our investment in Octopus Energy, implementation of the Kraken platform, and the Eraring battery project.\n\nThe Board has determined to pay a 20.0 cent per share dividend, franked to 100% bringing total distributions for the year to 36.5 cents per share, fully franked.",

This resulted in a ROCE 3 of 6.7 per cent in the period, up from negative 0.3 per cent in the prior year\n\nElectricity Gross Profit increased by $366 million to $574 million, driven by higher wholesale prices flowing into business and retail customer tariffs, reflecting the recovery of higher costs associated with the current and prior periods. Fuel costs increased primarily due to higher coal procurement costs with greater volumes purchased at higher market prices during the first half of FY2023. Across the year the coal price impact was lessened by the introduction of the coal price cap implemented in December 2022.\n\nNatural Gas Gross Profit increased by $379 million to $943 million, driven by repricing of business and retail customer tariffs reflecting higher wholesale costs, partly offset by higher net JKM and oil supply costs and higher procurement costs. Portfolio strength is underpinned by fixed price 4 supply contracts and transport flexibility. The JKM supply position is largely hedged through to the end of FY2024, and there is one gas supply counterparty that is subject to contract price review commencing July 2023.\n\nElectricity and Natural Gas cost to serve up $89 million, primarily driven by an increase in bad and doubtful debt expense due to higher bill sizes, cost of living pressures and slower aged debt collection.\n\nUnder the current challenging market conditions with high inflation and cost of living pressure, we are committed to relieving the pricing impacts on customers where possible. We provided around $30 million in bill relief and pricing support to our most vulnerable customers, including holding prices flat for customers who are on the Power On program.\n\nCustomer accounts increased by 66,000 of which our Broadband business grew by 35,000 to 96,000 customer accounts and won the 2023 Canstar Blue Best-Rated Bundled Energy and Telecommunications Provider award. Origin Loop (our in house VPP) more than tripled connected assets to 815 MW during the period.\n\nOur Origin Zero business is gaining momentum with new products, services and commercial models aimed at accelerating the decarbonisation journey for large business customers. There is now more than 200 MW of flexible large business demand enrolled in our VPP, more than 400 EVs under management through a range of E-mobility solutions and the number of large customers engaging in non-commodity products doubled to around 4 per cent during the year.\n\nOur generation fleet delivered exceptional performance, with over 98 per cent start reliability across our peaking fleet, and a forced outage at Eraring of less than 5 per cent.\n\nWe made a final investment decision on the first phase of the Eraring battery, and we also acquired the 60 MW Yanco Solar Farm development in NSW and a 5 per cent equity interest in Newcastle based clean-tech company Allegro Energy, and entered an agreement to acquire around 7,500 hectare Warrane farm in the New England Renewable Energy Zone (REZ) as a prospective greenfield wind development opportunity.\n\n- 3 12-month average.

Origin's share of APLNG underlying EBITDA increased by $355 million, excluding the impact of the 10 per cent ownership change in December 2021. This was partly offset by Origin's hedging losses associated with the higher commodity prices, increasing from $189 million in FY2022 to $235 million in FY2023.\n\nAPLNG production volumes decreased three per cent compared to the FY2022 reflecting the cumulative impact of the three consecutive years of La Ni\u00f1a weather into the first half of FY2023. Production rebounded strongly in the second half of FY2023, with drier weather allowing an increase in well workover activity and wells online. The Talinga Condabri North Pipeline ramped to full capacity in December 2022 and the Orana South Loop Line completed in April 2023, enabling field production uplift and greater operational flexibility.\n\nAPLNG maintained a significant role as a key contributor to the east coast market. The average realised domestic gas price increased by 37 per cent to $8.54/GJ, primarily reflecting higher market linked short term contract prices. Average prices offered to domestic customers remained below those paid by international customers.\n\nCapital and operating expenditure 5 increased by $0.7/GJ to $3.90/GJ reflecting both higher expenditure and lower production. Drier weather saw an increase in workover activity focused on reducing La Ni\u00f1a weather inventory backlog. Additionally, the commencement of planned multi-year upstream gas processing maintenance program and increased operated and non-operated well development activity led to higher costs.\n\nAPLNG 2P (proven plus probable) reserves increased 175 PJ before production, representing a reserves replacement ratio of 26 per cent, primarily driven by non-operated 2P reserve replacement during FY2023. After production, 2P reserves decreased by 499 PJ. 7\n\nOther highlights across Integrated Gas during the period included:\n\n- \u00b7 Beetaloo Basin - In November 2022 Origin completed the sale of its interest in the Northern Territory's Beetaloo Basin and received upfront consideration of $60 million and a royalty agreement covering future production.\n- \u00b7 Canning Basin - An agreement has been executed with Buru Energy Limited to exit Origin's interest in the Canning Basin and the transaction is now expected to complete in the first half of FY2024, awaiting regulatory approval.\n- \u00b7 Cooper-Eromanga Basin - Origin executed an agreement to transfer its 75 per cent interest and operatorship of five permits back to Bridgeport, and has surrendered the remaining twelve permits in the Cooper-Eromanga Basin.\n- \u00b7 Hunter Valley Hydrogen Hub - Origin executed a $70 million grant Funding Agreement with the Commonwealth Government for the implementation of the Hunter Valley Hydrogen Hub project.\n\n- 6 Origin's interest is 27.5 per cent.

Our portfolio of coal and gas generation plants, renewable energy Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) and market supply and hedge contracts gives us with the flexibility to manage energy procurement costs. As we sell more energy than we generate, we have the ability to build or contract renewable energy and storage.\n\nIn natural gas, Origin's wholesale margin is driven by a strong gas supply portfolio, with pipeline and storage flexibility enabling us to direct gas to where it is most needed. A large portion of supply is under long-term contracts that are either fixed-price 8 or linked to oil and LNG spot prices. Some of our contracts reprice to market over time.\n\nProfitability in energy retailing is driven by managing retail margins through matching retail tariffs with energy procurement costs combined with an efficient, low cost operation, innovative products, and the ability to attract and retain customers through providing a superior customer experience. We implemented the Kraken retail system to further lower our cost base and enhance our customer experiences.\n\nWe own 20 per cent of Octopus Energy 9 , a UK-based fast-growing energy technology company. Octopus owns the Kraken technology platform which has significant global licensing potential. Octopus is the second largest energy retailer by customer accounts in the UK.\n\nOrigin is the upstream operator and has a 27.5 per cent interest in APLNG, which is Australia's largest CSG to LNG project. It is a significant supplier to both domestic gas and international LNG markets, with the majority of volume contracted until around 2035. Profitability is underpinned by maintaining a low capital and operating cost base relative to revenues, much of which are linked to oil prices. In FY2023, around 77 per cent of APLNG gas volume was sold as LNG (of which 95 per cent was under long-term oil-linked contracts).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAccelerate renewable and cleaner energy\n\nDeliver reliable energy through the transition\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

We are targeting a $200 - 250 million cost reduction from FY2018 baseline by FY2025. As at FY2023 we have realised ~$150 million in cost savings, excluding the impact of rising bad and doubtful expenses\n- \u00b7 increasing the breadth of products offered including broadband, solar, batteries, connected solutions and E-mobility\n- \u00b7 using our strong data analytics capability to enable personalised and segmented offers and experiences for customers\n\nFor our larger business customers, we are working to simplify the energy transition, providing tailored energy and decarbonisation solutions through Origin Zero. These solutions can include elements such as renewable energy, demand response, solar, batteries, energy management and EV fleet management.\n\nThrough our Octopus Energy investment, we have access to an industry-leading retail platform to deliver the lowest cost and market-leading customer happiness, as well as exposure to Octopus's global growth.\n\n## Accelerate renewables and cleaner energy\n\nWe will invest in cleaner energy positions to support our customers' demand for energy and decarbonisation solutions. We will increase our renewable energy supply through new investments, partnerships, and projects, targeting multi-GW renewable growth opportunities through a staged and disciplined investment and/or contracting approach.\n\nIn addition to our significant thermal peaking generation portfolio, we will invest in growing our 'firming capacity' such as batteries and our VPP to support the growth of renewables during periods of peak demand and lower renewable generation.\n\nWe have developed a proprietary VPP platform to connect and use artificial intelligence to orchestrate distributed assets. We are growing our battery storage portfolio and took a final investment decision on the first stage of our battery project at Eraring.\n\nWe are investigating opportunities to invest in cleaner fuels for harder-to-abate sectors, including domestic and export green hydrogen projects, targeting domestic hydrogen supply from the mid 2020s and export supply from the late 2020s.\n\n## Deliver reliable energy through the transition\n\nWe have a valuable portfolio of assets that play a critical role in providing customers with reliable and affordable energy as we transition to a low-carbon future. We believe gas will remain a key part of the energy mix during the transition.\n\nThrough our 27.5 per cent interest in APLNG, we continue to be a low cost supplier of gas, for domestic and export customers.\n\nOur Eraring coal fired power station continues to support the reliability and security of the electricity market. We have announced the potential early retirement of Eraring as our portfolio and the market transitions to cleaner sources of energy and new sources of supply enter the market.\n\nOur existing thermal peaking generation will continue to play a critical role in providing capacity and firming as coal generators such as Eraring retire and are replaced by intermittent renewables.\n\nWe have a leading domestic wholesale gas position with the ability to transport gas across the east coast to support our gas fired generation fleet as well as residential, business and wholesale customers.",

Ongoing volatility in market conditions is likely and may adversely impact operations.\n\n## Energy Markets\n\nFY2024 EBITDA is expected to be $1,300 - $1,700 million , excluding Octopus Energy. Electricity gross profit is expected to increase due to tariffs repricing reflecting higher energy procurement costs and capacity prices in recent periods, improving the contribution from Eraring and our thermal peaking fleet. Coal price caps are also expected to continue to 30 June 2024, reducing fuel costs to Eraring. Gas gross profit is expected to moderate as energy procurement costs increase from supply contracts repricing and higher JKM linked supply costs.\n\nEnergy Markets' cash flow is expected to improve compared to FY2023, driven by higher earnings and the first refund of LGC shortfall charge, partially offset by higher working capital requirements driven by higher customer tariffs.\n\nWe anticipate a reduction in electricity gross profit in FY2025 as customer tariffs decline in line with wholesale costs following government intervention in late 2022. We expect to deliver on our commitment of $200 - $250 million cost reduction by FY2025, from an FY2018 baseline.\n\n## Octopus Energy\n\nOctopus is in a rapid growth phase and continues to invest in international growth, technology platform developments and services offerings. Origin's share of Octopus Energy EBITDA is expected to be lower with a wide range of possible outcomes reflecting stronger retail competition. FY2024 will include a full year contribution from Bulb.\n\n## Integrated Gas\n\nWe estimate higher production in FY2024 of 680 - 710 PJ (APLNG 100 per cent), reflecting La Ni\u00f1a weather production recovery and continued cyclical upstream gas processing maintenance program.\n\nWe estimate higher total APLNG capex and opex of $3.9 - $4.4/GJ , reflecting:\n\n- \u00b7 higher power costs;\n- \u00b7 increased workover and base production optimisation programs; and\n- \u00b7 higher non-operated development activity; partly offset by\n- \u00b7 lower cyclical maintenance.\n\nUnit capex and opex over FY2025 and FY2026 is expected to be lower at $3.6 - $4.1/GJ following delivery of production optimisation and cost of supply initiatives, completion of upstream cyclical maintenance program and expected lower power costs 10 .\n\nAt 7 August 2023, Origin estimates that approximately 41 per cent of APLNG's FY2024 JCC oil price exposure has been priced at US$84/bbl before hedging, based on the long-term LNG contract lags, and 23 per cent of APLNG's FY2024 JKM exposure has been priced at US$11/MMBtu.\n\nBased on forward market prices, we estimate losses in FY2024 on oil, gas and fx hedging of $27 million. We estimate a gain on LNG trading in FY2024 of $40 - $60 million, and across both FY2025 and FY2026, a gain of $450 - $650 million. This outlook remains subject to market prices on unhedged volumes, operational performance and delivery risk of physical cargoes, and shipping and regasification costs. See Section 6.3.2 for details of Integrated Gas oil hedging and LNG trading.",

These amounts are excluded from Underlying Profit to remove the volatility caused by timing mismatches in valuing financial instruments and the underlying transactions they relate to.\n\n- \u00b7 Oil and gas derivatives manage exposure to fluctuations in the underlying commodity price to which Origin is exposed through its gas portfolio and indirectly through Origin's investment in APLNG. See Section 6.3.2 for details of Origin's APLNG-related oil hedging.\n- \u00b7 Electricity derivatives, including swaps, options and forward purchase contracts, are used to manage fluctuations in wholesale electricity and environmental certificate prices in respect of electricity purchased to meet customer demand.\n- \u00b7 Foreign exchange and interest rate derivatives manage exposures associated with the debt portfolio. A portion of debt is eurodenominated and cross-currency interest rate swaps hedge that debt to AUD.\n- \u00b7 Other financial assets/liabilities reflects investments held by Origin.\n- \u00b7 Foreign exchange on foreign-denominated financing reflects currency fluctuations on unhedged USD debt. Debt is maintained in USD to offset the USD-denominated investment in APLNG, which delivers USD cash distributions.\n\nImpairment, disposals, business restructuring and other are either non-cash or non-recurring items and are excluded from Underlying Profit to better reflect the underlying performance of the business.

Refer to Appendix 1 for further details;\n- \u00b7 $77 million net cost relating to a decision to defer the surrender of a portion of Origin's calendar year 2022 large-scale generation certificates. The costs associated with this deferral are expected to be recovered in future periods. Refer to Appendix 2 for further details; and\n- \u00b7 $245 million non-cash benefit relating to revaluation of the LNG onerous contract provisions, reflecting a reduction in the provision as the contract unwinds. This was partly offset by unfavourable movements in near term JKM relative to Henry Hub pricing. The realised position for the period associated with these contracts is recognised in Underlying Profit.\n\nThe nature of Items Excluded from Underlying Profit set out in the above table have been reviewed by our auditor for consistency with the description in Note A1 of the Financial Statements.",

Distributions from APLNG are included in investing activities, and increased $188 million from FY2022.\n\nOperating cash flow decreased $1,164 million, reflecting:\n\n- \u00b7 Unfavourable change in working capital cash flows ($1,651 million) reflecting an outflow of ($1,061 million) in FY2023, compared with an inflow of $590 million in the prior period. Current year cash outflow driven by:\n- - Energy Markets working capital balances increased by $671 million driven by the unwind of higher priced net creditors for wholesale energy, following the extreme wholesale price environment in FY2022. A build up of the Eraring coal stockpile occurred during H1 FY2023, however the value of inventory has moderated in H2 FY2023 due to lower coal prices, following the implementation of the coal cap in December 2022\n- - Integrated Gas working capital balances increased by $113 million during the period primarily reflecting the cash settlement timing of LNG trading activities;\n- - Futures collateral outflow of $290 million reflecting cash collateral paid associated with the mark to market valuation of gas and electricity hedge contracts\n- \u00b7 Other ($182 million), which primarily reflects the cash impact of items excluded from Underlying Profit, primarily restructuring costs excluded from Underlying Profit and the 2022 LGC shortfall charge (see Appendix 2 for further details)\n- \u00b7 Increased income tax paid ($166 million) reflecting the commencement of unfranked dividends received from APLNG\n- \u00b7 Lower earnings from Integrated Gas - Other ($30 million)\n- \u00b7 Partially offset by higher earnings from Energy Markets ($637 million)\n\nUnderlying equity accounted share of EBITDA (non-cash) reflects share of APLNG ($2,246 million) and share of Octopus Energy ($240 million). Other non-cash expenses include provisions for bad and doubtful debts ($148 million), share-based remuneration ($25 million) exploration expense write-off ($23 million), partly offset by change in value of derivatives ($21 million).",

The obligation is typically satisfied by bank guarantees; however the obligation was partially met with cash in FY2022, and subsequently refunded to Origin in FY2023\n\nOn-market purchase of shares represents the purchase of shares connected with employee share remuneration schemes as well as a share buy back in FY2022. The employee share plan terminated in March 2023 due to the proposed acquisition of Origin by the Consortium.\n\nSettlement of foreign currency contracts represents the partial closure of contracts executed in prior periods to monetise the value in certain cross-currency interest rate swap contracts.

The average interest rate on drawn debt increased from 4.3 per cent in FY2022 to 5.0 per cent in FY2023.\n\nAs at 30 June 2023, Origin held $0.4 billion 12 in cash and $2.8 billion in committed undrawn debt facilities. This liquidity position of $3.2 billion is held to meet near-term debt and lease liability payment obligations of $0.2 billion and to maintain a sufficient liquidity buffer.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## APLNG funding\n\nDuring construction of APLNG, shareholders contributed capital via ordinary equity and the investment in preference shares (termed MRCPS) issued by APLNG, with the MRCPS fully redeemed prior to the end of FY2022. Subsequent distributions from APLNG have been received via unfranked dividends.\n\nAPLNG also funded construction via US$8.5 billion (APLNG 100 per cent) in project finance facilities. These facilities were partially refinanced in FY2019. The outstanding balance at 30 June 2023 was US$4,888 million (A$7,374 million), net of unamortised debt fees of US$39 million (A$59 million).

This brings Origin's total distributions to shareholders for FY2023 to 36.5 cents per share, representing 66 per cent of Adjusted Free Cash Flow. The final dividend will be paid on 29 September to shareholders registered as at 6 September 2023.\n\nOrigin will seek to deliver sustainable shareholder returns through the business cycle and will typically target a payout range of 30 per cent to 50 per cent of Adjusted Free Cash Flow per annum in the form of ordinary dividends. Adjusted Free Cash Flow is defined as cash from operating activities and investing activities (excluding major growth projects), less interest paid. Remaining cash flow will be applied to further debt reduction, value accretive organic growth and acquisition opportunities, and/or additional capital management initiatives.\n\nThe dividend payout ratio of 66 percent is above the target range, reflecting the improved earnings outlook, the company's strong balance sheet and the one-off increase in working capital.\n\nThe Board maintains discretion to adjust shareholder distributions for economic and business conditions. Further capital management initiatives will be considered by the Board during FY2024 and beyond, taking into account franking balances, business conditions, growth opportunities, and the status of the Brookfield/EIG transaction.",

Unit fuel costs increased from $68.2/MWh to $87.8/ MWh. Eraring generation was higher (+1.2 TWh) with improved coal deliveries from our key coal supplier via conveyor and from suppliers via rail, as Origin seeks to diversify its coal supply chain. Coal price was higher driven by greater volumes of coal purchased at higher market prices during the first half of FY2023 as long term contractual supply contracts approach their expiration date. Across the year the coal price impact was softened by the introduction of the coal price cap implemented in December 2022;\n- \u00b7 -$91 million due to higher other electricity procurement costs, largely reflecting higher net pool costs due to higher pool prices on short positions and higher generation operating costs on increased maintenance activities as well as ash dam related costs. Bundled renewable PPA costs increased due to higher Stockyard Hill volumes, partly offset by lower Solar FiT costs driven by improved value management of Solar customers, as well as lower market contract volumes purchased due to improved Eraring output; and\n- \u00b7 Volumes increased 0.4 TWh, reflecting a 0.7 TWh increase in business volumes on net customer wins, partly offset by a 0.3 TWh decrease in retail volumes due to lower household usage. With the volume increase primarily related to customers on pool price pass-through arrangements, there was no material impact to Gross Profit.\n\nOwned and contracted generation output of 19.0 TWh, was higher\n\nby 0.3 TWh on FY2022, primarily driven by higher Eraring generation output. Generation from renewable PPAs (+0.2 TWh) increased due to Stockyard Hill volumes received while ramping up production.

Higher labour costs have been incurred in our Retail business driven by compliance, regulatory and growth activities.\n\nThe migration of mass market electricity and natural gas customers to the Kraken platform was successfully completed in early May 2023.

On 8 November 2022, Origin entered into an agreement to sell Origin's LPG business in the Pacific. This includes our wholly-owned operations in Vanuatu, American Samoa, Samoa and Cook Islands, and joint-venture operations in Fiji, Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands. The sale remains subject to fulfilment of conditions precedent and regulatory approvals. The LPG business in the Pacific contributed $27 million of EBITDA in FY2023.\n\nGross Profit was higher in FY2023 largely driven by higher retail sales across both Australian and Pacific businesses. Volumes were up 5 per cent as a result of continued growth in large commercial segment and recovery in pacific economies post COVID-19 downturn.

The result primarily reflects an increase in customer accounts and the lag in reset of regulated tariffs in the UK retail business.\n\nTariffs are capped by the regulator Ofgem and reflect an allowance for wholesale, network, operating and other costs. The loss in the prior year resulted from incurring higher cost of energy, with an inability to pass this onto customers due to the lag in the reset of regulated tariffs. The current year saw these costs recouped. During FY2023 there was also a change in the reset frequency from six months to quarterly, enabling more rapid response to changing wholesale market prices. This allowed higher wholesale costs in HY2023 to be recouped in the second half. The majority of Octopus' customers are priced at a discount to the Ofgem price cap.\n\nFY2023 saw a six-month contribution from the customers acquired from Bulb Energy, which added 2.5 million customer accounts in December 2022. The contribution includes accounting fair value considerations as a result of the acquisition agreement and will continue to do so for the duration of the agreement. Following the Bulb acquisition, Octopus Energy is the second largest UK energy retailer by customer accounts and is continuing to grow organically. Customer accounts in the UK retail business have grown to around 9.7 million at the end of June 2023, a 61 per cent increase in the year.\n\nOctopus' software licensing business, Kraken, has achieved a 25 per cent growth in accounts contracted to the platform.\n\nKraken earns recurring revenue from licencing the platform to utilities as well as one-off fees earned through the period of customer account migration. Recurring revenue will grow as accounts are migrated onto the platform. Total licensing revenue is down as FY2022 included higher one-off migration and performance payments.\n\nThe Kraken platform is now contracted to serve over half of all UK households, with a strong global sales pipeline, driving towards a 100 million licensed customer account ambition by 2027. All of EON's UK customers and Origin's mass-market electricity and natural gas customer accounts have been successfully migrated to the Kraken platform. Migration has begun for EDF's UK customers. Kraken licensing has expanded into new utilities, with the first water and broadband deals signed in July 2023.\n\nOctopus' operating costs increased, driven by investment in people to scale up growth in licensing delivery, energy installation services and international retail businesses.",

Prior to 8 December 2021 it was 37.5 per cent.\n\nAPLNG production volumes decreased 3 per cent compared to FY2022 reflecting the cumulative impact of the three consecutive years of La Ni\u00f1a weather, which restricted access to fields for workovers, drilling and optimisation activities during the first half of FY2023. The commencement of a planned multi-year upstream gas processing maintenance program in addition to unplanned non-operated outages also contributing to the decline in production.\n\nProduction rebounded strongly in the second half of FY2023 with favourable drier weather. This allowed an increase in well workover activity and increasing the rates of online wells, which, coupled with production optimisation projects, increased overall production. Talinga Condabri North Pipeline ramped to full capacity and Orana South Loop Line also completed, enabling additional field production uplift and greater operational flexibility. This led to multiple daily operated production records, peaking at 1,618 TJ/day in May 2023.\n\nAPLNG sales volumes decreased 3 per cent, reflecting lower production volumes during FY2023.\n\nThe average realised LNG price increased 22 per cent to A$20.01/GJ driven by higher realised oil prices. The average realised domestic gas price increased 37 per cent to $8.54/GJ, primarily driven by market-linked short-term contract prices.",

The FY2023 net loss included a hedge loss of $271 million associated with 5.4 MMbbl of oil swaps and 1.6MMbbl of oil producer collars which realised a hedge price of US$99/bbl. These hedge contracts were established over October 2020 to August 2021 during the height of the COVID pandemic to protect the company's investment grade credit rating.\n\nBased on current forward market prices 20 , we estimate a net loss on oil, gas and FX hedging in FY2024 of $27 million.\n\n| ($m)                                   | FY23 actual   | FY22 actual   | FY24 estimate 1   |\n|----------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|-------------------|\n| Oil hedging premium expense            | (22)          | (28)          | (2)               |\n| Gain/(loss) on oil, gas and FX hedging | (271)         | (137)         | (25)              |\n| Gain/(loss) on LNG trading             | 58            | (23)          |                   |\n| Total                                  | (235)         | (189)         |                   |\n\n## Oil, gas and fx hedging\n\nOrigin has entered into oil and gas hedging instruments for the FY2024 and FY2025 periods to manage its share of APLNG oil and gas price risk based on the primary principle of protecting the Company's investment grade credit rating and cash flows during volatile market periods and to satisfy conditions outlined in the Consortium's proposal.\n\nFor FY2024, Origin's share of APLNG related Japan Customs-cleared Crude (JCC) oil and Japan Korea Marker (JKM) gas price exposure is estimated to be approximately 17 MMboe and 18 tBtu respectively. As at 7 August 2023, we estimate that 41 per cent of JCC and 23 per cent of JKM have been priced (based on LNG contract lags) at approximately US$84/bbl and US$11/MMBtu respectively, before any hedging.\n\nAs at 7 August 2023, Origin has separately hedged to provide downside protection for FY2024 using the following instruments:\n\n- \u00b7 2.0 MMbbl of Brent USD swaps hedged at a fixed price of A$137/bbl;\n- \u00b7 0.8 MMbbl of Brent producer collars struck between US$35/bbl and US$90/bbl;\n- \u00b7 6.2 MMbbl of JCC USD swaps hedged at a fixed price of US$81/bbl\n- \u00b7 4.2 tBtu of JKM futures hedged at a fixed price of US$16/MMBtu; and\n- \u00b7 US$205 million FX forwards hedged at a fixed rate of 0.70.\n\nAs at 7 August 2023, 3.7 MMbbl of oil hedging and 0.4 tBtu JKM hedging have been priced at US$86/bbl and US$15/MMBtu respectively. Based on a forward oil price of US$87/bbl and forward JKM price of US$15/MMBtu, the effective prices of the remaining 4.5 MMbbl of oil hedging and 3.8 tBtu JKM hedging are US$82/bbl and US$16/MMBtu respectively. This would result in an effective oil price on the company's FY2024 approximate 17 MMboe oil exposure and 18 tBtu JKM exposure of US$85/bbl and US$15/MMBtu including hedges.\n\nPremium spend for this hedge position is A$2 million.\n\nThe FY2025 hedge position consists of:\n\n- \u00b7 6.2 MMbbl oil swaps hedged at a fixed price of US$76/bbl;\n- \u00b7 3.5 tBtu JKM futures hedged at a fixed price of US$14/MMBtu; and\n- \u00b7 US$162m FX forwards hedged at a fixed price of 0.69.\n\n## LNG hedging and trading\n\nIn 2013, Origin established a Henry Hub linked contract to purchase 0.25 mtpa from Cameron LNG for a period of 20 years, with the first cargo delivered to Origin in June 2020.\n\nIn 2016, Origin established a medium term contract with ENN LNG Trading Company Limited to sell ~0.28 mtpa commencing in FY2019. As at 30 June 2022, a non-cash onerous provision of $397 million was held in relation to this contract, reflecting stronger LNG prices relative to Brent oil prices. In FY2023, a reduction in the non-cash onerous provision of $335 million was recognised, with the provision revalued to $62 million as at 30 June 2023, reflecting a decline in near-term LNG price assumptions relative to Brent oil prices.\n\nThese contracts and derivative hedge contracts that manage the price risk associated with the physical LNG contracts form part of an LNG trading portfolio.\n\nBased on market forward prices as at 7 August 2023, the FY2024 LNG trading EBITDA is expected to be between $40 - 60 million. Across both FY2025 and FY2026, the total LNG trading EBITDA is expected to be between $450 - 650 million. This outlook remains subject to market prices on unhedged volumes, operational performance and delivery risk of physical cargoes, and shipping and regasification costs.",

Material risks, and the Company's approach to managing them, are summarised below.\n\n## Risk management framework\n\nOverseen by the Board and the Board Risk Committee, Origin's risk management framework supports the identification, management and reporting of material risks. Risks are identified that have the potential to impact the delivery of business plans and objectives. Risks are assessed using a risk toolkit that considers the level of consequence and likelihood of occurrence using consistent risk assessment criteria.\n\nThe risk framework incorporates a \"three lines of defence\" model for managing risks and controls in areas such as health and safety, environment, climate change, financial, reputation and brand, legal and compliance and social impacts. All employees are responsible for making risk-based decisions and managing risk within approved risk appetite and specific limits.\n\nThe Board reviews Origin's material risks each quarter and assesses the effectiveness of the Company's risk management framework annually in accordance with the ASX Corporate Governance Principles and Recommendations.\n\n## Three lines of defence\n\n| Line of defence                 | Responsibility                                                                                   | Primary accountability                  |\n|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|\n| First line                      |                                                                                                  |                                         |\n| Lines of business               | Identifies, assesses, records, prioritises, manages and monitors risks.                          | Management                              |\n| Second line Oversight functions | Provides the risk management framework, tools and systems to  support effective risk management. | Management                              |\n| Third line Internal audit       | Provides assurance on the effectiveness of governance, risk  management and internal controls.   | Board, Board Committees  and Management |\n\nOrigin's risk framework supports the identification and management of emerging risks and escalating threats. During FY2023, the accelerating energy transition, as well as ongoing geopolitical risks, inflationary pressures, and supply chain disruptions were key threats to operational and financial performance. These threats required ongoing response and management across many of our existing material risks to minimise impacts. Our priorities remain ensuring the continuity of operations and supporting activities to provide essential services to our customers, and maintaining our financial resilience to respond to changes in global markets.\n\n## Material risks\n\nThe risks identified in this section have the potential to materially affect Origin's ability to meet our business objectives and impact its future financial prospects. These risks are not exhaustive and are not arranged in order of significance.\n\n## Strategic risks\n\nStrategic risks arise from uncertainties that may emerge in the medium to longer term and, while they may not necessarily impact on short-term profits, can have an immediate impact on the value of the Company. These strategic risks are managed through continuous monitoring and reviewing of emerging and escalating risks, ongoing planning and the allocation of resources, and evaluation by Management and the Board.\n\n| Risk        | Consequences                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Management                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Competition | Origin operates in a highly competitive retail environment which  can result in pressure on margins and customer losses.

        "page_content": "## 8 APLNG reversion\n\nIn 2002, APLNG acquired various CSG interests from Tri-Star that are subject to reversionary rights and an ongoing royalty in favour of Tri-Star. If triggered, the reversionary rights require APLNG to transfer back to Tri-Star a 45 per cent interest in those CSG interests for no additional consideration. The reversion trigger will occur when a calculation of the revenue from the sale of petroleum from those CSG interests, plus any other revenue derived from or in connection with those CSG interests, exceeds the aggregate of all expenditure relating to those CSG interests plus interest on that expenditure, royalty payments and the original acquisition price.\n\nThe affected CSG interests represent approximately 18 per cent of APLNG's 3P CSG reserves (as at 30 June 2023), and approximately 19 per cent of APLNG's 2P CSG reserves (as at 30 June 2023).\n\nTri-Star served proceedings on APLNG in 2015 ('2015 proceeding') claiming that reversion occurred as early as 1 November 2008 following ConocoPhillips' investment in APLNG, on the assertion that the equity subscription monies paid by ConocoPhillips, or a portion of them, were revenue for purposes of the reversion trigger (the ConocoPhillips reversion claim). Tri-Star has also claimed in the alternative that reversion occurred in 2011 or 2012 following Sinopec's investment in APLNG (the Sinopec reversion claim). These claims are referred to in this document as Tri-Star's \"past reversion\" claims.\n\nTri-Star has made other claims in the 2015 proceeding against APLNG relating to other aspects of the reversion trigger calculation (including as to the calculation of interest, calculation of revenue and the nature and quantum of APLNG's expenditures that can be included), the calculation of the royalty payable by APLNG to Tri-Star, rights in respect of infrastructure, and claims relating to gas sold by APLNG following the alleged reversion dates. APLNG denies these claims and is defending the proceedings.\n\nIf Tri-Star's past reversion claims are successful, then Tri-Star may be entitled to an order that reversion occurred as early as 1 November 2008. If the court determines that reversion has occurred, then APLNG may no longer have access to the reserves and resources that are subject to Tri-Star's reversionary interests and may need to source alternative supplies of gas (including from third parties) to meet its contracted commitments. There are also likely to be a number of further complex issues that would need to be resolved as a consequence of any such finding in favour of Tri-Star. These matters will need to be determined by the court (either in the current or in separate proceedings) or by agreement between the parties, and they include:\n\n- \u00b7 the terms under which some of the affected CSG interests will be operated where currently there are no joint operating agreements in place;\n- \u00b7 the amount of Tri-Star's contribution to the costs incurred by APLNG in exploring and developing the affected CSG interests between the date of reversion and the date of judgment, which APLNG has stated in its defence and counter-claim are in the order of $4.56 billion (as at 31 December 2019) if reversion occurred on 1 November 2008; and\n- \u00b7 the consequences of APLNG having dealt with Tri-Star's reversionary interests between the date of past reversion and the date of judgment, including the gas produced from them. Tri-Star has:\n- - estimated the value of such gas which it has been unable to take since the alleged reversion, calculated by reference to the sale of gas as LNG and gas to domestic customers, to be approximately $3.37 billion (as at 31 March 2019) and approximately $1.3 billion per annum thereafter. TriStar claims that the value of gas sold as LNG should be\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- assessed by reference to the revenue derived by APLNG or its affiliates from LNG sales since the alleged reversion, being approximately $2.5 billion (as at March 2019), or $2.4 billion (as at March 2019) if the proceeds from the sale of LNG is determined to be calculated net of liquefaction costs;\n- - conceded in its claim that certain costs for processing and transportation of that gas would need to be deducted from the value of gas to calculate the quantum of its claim, but has not quantified those costs; and\n- - alleged that it should be paid the value of such gas after deduction of those costs or is otherwise entitled to set-off the value of such gas from any amount owing to APLNG arising from APLNG's counter-claim for contribution to the costs incurred by APLNG in exploring and developing the affected CSG interests between the date of reversion and the date of judgement; and\n- \u00b7 if reversion occurred:\n- - the extent of the reversionary interests principally with respect to Tri-Star's ownership and/or rights to use or access certain project infrastructure; and\n- - the repayment by Tri-Star of the ongoing royalty which has been paid by APLNG since reversion, resulting from its mistake as to the occurrence of the reversion trigger.\n\nIf APLNG is successful in defending Tri-Star's past reversion claims in the 2015 proceeding, the potential for reversion to otherwise occur in the future in accordance with the reversion trigger will remain.\n\nIn 2017, Tri-Star commenced separate proceedings against APLNG ('2017 proceeding') which allege that APLNG breached three CSG joint operating agreements by failing to offer Tri-Star (and the other minority participants in those agreements) an opportunity to participate in the 'markets' alleged to be constituted by certain of APLNG's LNG and domestic gas sales agreements, including the Sinopec and Kansai LNG sale agreements entered into by APLNG in 2011 and 2012. Tri-Star has alleged that it should have been offered participation in those sales agreements for its share of production from those three CSG joint ventures referable to both its small participating interests and its reversionary interests in those joint ventures (the markets claim). In that regard, Tri-Star is claiming, amongst other things, damages and/or an order that APLNG offer Tri-Star (and the other minority participants in those CSG joint operating agreements) the opportunity to participate in those sales agreements for their proportionate share of production from those three CSG joint ventures. APLNG denies these claims and is defending these proceedings.\n\nIn September 2019, Tri-Star made further claims in the 2017 proceeding relating to:\n\n- \u00b7 the nature and scope of the obligations of APLNG as operator pursuant to the CSG joint operating agreements;\n- \u00b7 Tri-Star's ownership and/or rights to use or access certain project infrastructure; and\n- \u00b7 APLNG's entitlement as operator to charge (both historically and in the future) certain categories of costs under the relevant CSG joint operating agreements.\n\nAPLNG filed defences and counterclaims in both proceedings in April and May 2020. In December 2020, Tri-Star filed replies and answers in both proceedings. APLNG filed its rejoinders in the 2015 proceeding and the 2017 proceeding in February and April 2021 respectively. APLNG filed a further amended defence and counterclaim in the 2015 proceeding in December 2021.\n\nIn September 2021, Tri-Star filed and served an application in both proceedings for questions to be determined separately (or further or alternatively referred to a referee to conduct an inquiry into and prepare a report to the court on those questions). The questions proposed for separate determination in those applications included",

APLNG opposed those applications. The applications were heard in April 2022 and both were ultimately dismissed by the Court.\n\nTri-Star recently notified APLNG that it intends to seek to amend its claims in both proceedings. In relation to the 2017 proceedings, Tri-Star's proposed amendments include it not continuing with the markets claim. In relation to the 2015 proceedings, Tri-Star's proposed amendments include:\n\n- \u00b7 not continuing with the Sinopec reversion claim (that is, the claim that reversion occurred in 2011 or 2012, following Sinopec's investment in APLNG);\n- \u00b7 the addition of an alternative claim that if the ConocoPhillips reversion claim is not successful, the reversion trigger nevertheless occurred by no later than 1 August 2022;\n- \u00b7 the addition of alternative bases for Tri-Star's claims for compensation or damages relevant to the consequences of the alleged past reversion, including as:\n- - compensation calculated on the basis of loss of opportunity to sell the affected CSG interests in 2008 or 2009;\n- - equitable compensation calculated on the basis of the 'market value' of the gas produced from the affected CSG interests since the alleged reversion on 1 November 2008); or\n- - an account of the profits earned by APLNG or its affiliates from the affected CSG interests since 1 November 2008 with Tri-Star asserting that the revenue received by APLNG for that gas is to be calculated in a similar manner to the existing claim.\n\nAs to the proposed claim for equitable compensation, Tri-Star asserts that the 'market value' of the gas should be determined by reference to the wholesale spot price for domestic gas on the East coast of Australia as at the date of trial or, alternatively, by reference to the wholesale gas market prices for the East coast of Australia as at the relevant date the gas was sold plus compound interest. Tri-Star concedes that certain processing and transportation costs (which have not been quantified by Tri-Star) will also need to be deducted to determine the quantum of this claim. There are presently a number of uncertainties as to the quantum of this claim, if it were able to be established by Tri-Star, including details of Tri-Star's calculations as to the market value of the gas, the amount of costs to be deducted, changes to the amount claimed to account for sales of gas up to the date of trial and the prevailing relevant prices at, and ahead, of that date.\n\nTri-Star has not yet served a final version of its proposed amended pleadings and will need the leave of the Court to file any such amendments. If leave is granted, once Tri-Star files its amended claims and statements of claim, APLNG will prepare and file amended defences and counterclaims in response to defend the amended claims. The parties may also need to prepare replies and rejoinders. Once that process is finalised, the Court will make further orders for the conduct of the two proceedings.\n\nBefore the proceedings are set down for trial, the Court would ordinarily order a number of procedural steps to be completed by the parties, including document disclosure, evidence preparation and exchange and pre-trial mediation. The process that will be followed in the 2015 and 2017 proceedings (and the procedural timetable) will depend on the decisions of the Court and is difficult to predict at this stage.\n\nIf APLNG is not successful in defending all or some of the claims being made in the proceedings by Tri-Star, APLNG's financial performance may be materially adversely impacted and the amount and timing of cash flows from APLNG to its shareholders, including Origin, may be significantly affected.",

Origin calculates Scope 3 emissions based on the Greenhouse Gas Protocol's Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting and Reporting Standard 22 and Scope 3 guidance documents 23 .\n\nDue to the inherent uncertainty and limitations in measuring emissions under the calculation methodologies used in the preparation of such data, all emissions data or references to emissions volumes (including ratios or percentages) in this presentation are estimates. Where data is not available due to timing, Origin applies a reasonable estimation methodology. Where applicable, Origin revises prior year data to update prior estimates and align with external reporting requirements such as NGER.\n\n## Enforceable Undertaking with SafeWork NSW\n\nIn March 2020 an explosion and fire occurred at Origin Energy's Minto LPG Terminal, New South Wales while a worker was filling LPG cylinders.

It has not been probable that the temporary difference will reverse in the foreseeable future via dividends paid from current retained earnings, capital returns or a disposal.\n\nAs it had become probable in FY2021 that APLNG would begin to distribute cash to shareholders via dividends in the coming years, Origin recognised a deferred tax liability. Recognition of the deferred tax liability only impacts the timing of accounting for the tax expense and has no impact on the underlying economics or cash flows.\n\nDuring the year, the unfranked ordinary dividends of $1,783 million were received from APLNG.\n\nThe unfranked dividends received during the year were higher than our share of equity accounted income of $1,184 million, which means the excess has been paid out of prior year profits.\n\nThe proportion paid from current year earnings gave rise to a tax expense of $355 million and the balance paid out of prior year profits resulted in the partial utilisation of previously recognised deferred tax liability of $180 million.\n\nAs at 30 June 2023, we have a deferred tax liability on the balance sheet of $528 million, representing 30 per cent of the dividends expected to be paid by APLNG in the foreseeable future from the carried forward equity accounted earnings based on current market assumptions, including future oil prices, in respect of our interest of 27.5 per cent.\n\nThere is a remaining unrecognised deferred tax liability at 30 June 2023 of $759 million which may be partly or fully recognised in the future.\n\n## 2 Accounting for large-scale generation certificate trading strategy\n\nSupply and demand for large-scale generation certificates (LGCs) is driven by the rate of new renewable projects coming online, voluntary demand for carbon offsets as well as the compliance obligations under the Large-scale Renewable Energy Target (LRET). Renewable project delays and generation curtailments have led to a near-term tightening of the LGC market. However, it is expected that the 33 TWh legislated target will be exceeded and longer term the market will be oversupplied. The Clean Energy Regulator has acknowledged this and provides the option for parties to shift demand from periods of tight supply by deferring the surrender of certificates to later years. Under the scheme, parties can defer up to 10 per cent of their obligation at no additional cost and can defer more than 10 per cent by incurring a shortfall charge of $65 per certificate that is refundable provided the LGCs are surrendered within three years. Refunds are now non-assessable for tax following legislative change and aligns with the non-deductible treatment of the shortfall charge.\n\nThis presents an economic opportunity with the LGC forward curve in backwardation and Origin has elected to defer surrender of 2.5 million CY2020 certificates in February 2021, 3.6 million CY2021 certificates in February 2022, and 3.2 million CY2022 certificates in February 2023.\n\nDuring FY2023, a shortfall charge of $206 million was paid in relation to CY2022 certificates of which $92 million was accrued in FY2022. Included in the FY2023 Underlying Profit is a cost of $38 million, reflecting the estimated future surrender cost, based on a weighted average of the current forward price and purchases to date, comprising:\n\n- \u00b7 1.4 million CY2022 certificates recorded in FY2022 repriced from $14 to $18;\n- \u00b7 1.8 million CY2022 certificates at $18 per certificate.\n\nThe balance of $76 million is excluded from Underlying Profit.\n\nOver FY2024 to FY2026 we will receive a net cash refund of $425 million, representing the shortfall charge paid less the actual cost of the certificates:\n\n- \u00b7 $114 million in FY2024;\n- \u00b7 $163 million in FY2025;\n- \u00b7 $148 million in FY2026.",

Amounts paid to EY are included in note G7 to the full financial statements.\n\nBased on written advice received from the Audit Committee Chair pursuant to a resolution passed by the Audit Committee, the Board has formed the view that the provision of those non-audit services by EY is compatible with, and did not compromise, the general standards of independence for auditors imposed by the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth).\n\nThe Board's reasons for concluding that the non-audit services provided by EY did not compromise its independence are:\n\n- \u00b7 all non-audit services provided were subjected to the Company's corporate governance procedures and were either below the pre- approved limits imposed by the Audit Committee or separately approved by the Audit Committee;\n- \u00b7 all non-audit services provided did not, and do not, undermine the general principles relating to auditor independence as they did not involve reviewing or auditing the auditor's own work, acting in a management or decision making capacity for the Company, acting as an advocate for the Company or jointly sharing risks and rewards; and\n- \u00b7 there were no known conflict of interest situations nor any other circumstance arising out of a relationship between Origin (including its Directors and Officers) and EY which may impact on auditor independence.\n\n## 11 Proceedings on behalf of the Company\n\nThe Company is not aware of any proceedings being brought on behalf of the Company, nor any applications having been made in respect of the Company under section 237 of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth).\n\n## 12 Rounding of amounts\n\nThe Company is of a kind referred to in ASIC Corporations (Rounding in Financial/ Directors' Reports) Instrument 2016/191 dated 24 March 2016 and, in accordance with that class order, amounts in the financial report and Directors' Report have been rounded off to the nearest million dollars unless otherwise stated.\n\n## 13 Remuneration\n\nThe Remuneration Report forms part of this Directors' Report.",

It has been prepared in accordance with the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) (the Act) and Accounting Standards, audited as required by section 308(3C) of the Act.\n\n## Letter from the Chairman of the Remuneration, People and Culture Committee\n\nDear Shareholder\n\nOn behalf of the Remuneration, People and Culture Committee (RPCC) and the Board, I am pleased to present the Remuneration Report for FY2023.\n\nThe Company has delivered strong results in a year characterised by extraordinary volatility of commodity prices in the early part of the year and a changing regulatory environment. The results were driven by a recovery in earnings from Energy Markets and higher contributions from Octopus Energy and Integrated Gas. Energy Markets earnings increased as higher wholesale prices flowed into customer tariffs. Octopus Energy earnings increased due to the growth in retail customer accounts and the reset of regulated tariffs in the UK. In Integrated Gas, higher global oil prices resulted in record revenue for Australia Pacific LNG during the period. Throughout the year, the management team maintained its focus on executing the clear strategies to lead the energy transition, managing risks and ensuring reliable supply.\n\n## FY2023 remuneration outcomes\n\nAs foreshadowed in the FY2022 Remuneration Report, following comprehensive benchmarking the Fixed Remuneration (FR) of the CEO was increased by 4.0 per cent at the start of FY2023. The FR of other Executive Key Management Personnel (KMP) increased by an average of 3.5 per cent, which is slightly less than adjustments applied to staff across the organisation more generally.\n\nThere were no changes to the variable pay structure or opportunity levels for executives in FY2023. Details regarding the Short Term Incentive Plan (STIP) and Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) variable pay arrangements are provided in Sections 3.4 and 3.5 respectively.\n\nRemuneration outcomes reflected the strength of operational and financial performance. In summary:\n\n- \u00b7 Scorecard outcomes for the Short Term Incentive Plan (STIP) were 75.3 per cent of the maximum for the CEO, and ranged from 74.0 per cent to 90.2 per cent of the maximum for Other Executive KMP. The aggregate Executive KMP outcome was 79.3 per cent of the maximum, reflecting the solid results for the year. Further details are provided in Sections 4.2.1 to 4.2.3.\n- \u00b7 Long Term Incentive (LTI) awards tested during the year vested partially (16.0 per cent), based on the outcomes of four separate tests on awards that were granted in the calendar years 2017 and 2019. Full details are provided in Section 4.2.4. Partial vests for each of the last three years (following eight years of consecutive zero vests) reflect recent improvements in Return on Capital Employed (ROCE) performance, and (as noted below) recent improvements in Total Shareholder Return (TSR) will be reflected in full LTIP vesting during FY2024. These trends reflect consistent and strong improvements in long-term performance over the last four years.\n\nOn 9 November 2022, the Company received an indicative, conditional and non-binding proposal from a Consortium consisting of Brookfield and MidOcean Energy (an LNG company managed by EIG) to acquire all the issued shares in the Company by way of a scheme of arrangement and on 27 March 2023 executed a binding Scheme Implementation Deed (SID) in relation to the proposed scheme of arrangement (Scheme). The Scheme remains subject to various conditions, including that Origin shareholders approve it at a meeting of shareholders and that it receives court and regulatory approvals. Following receipt of the proposal, targeted retention arrangements were put in place during December 2022 that covered 232 employees (at a conditional total value of $17 million) deemed critical to continuing safe operations, including one member of the Executive KMP. See Section 3.7 for more details.\n\n## Remuneration for FY2024\n\nEach year, the RPCC considers the remuneration framework's continuing appropriateness in terms of Origin's strategies and priorities. It also considers the framework's effectiveness and capacity to provide realisable remuneration that attracts and keeps the right people, drives their focus and rewards execution.\n\nWhile the Board concluded this year that the current framework and policy settings remain balanced and appropriate, the operation of the equity components of the STIP and LTIP has been impacted by the execution of the SID. Remuneration arrangements relating to the Scheme will be set out in a separate scheme booklet that will be provided to shareholders at the appropriate time. However, some changes to Origin's remuneration approach for FY2024 were also necessary because of the proposed Scheme. Since the proposal was announced, Origin's share price has become reflective of the proposed bid price. This impacts the assessment of performance, particularly in relation to the use of a Relative TSR hurdle, which has been used historically within Origin's LTIP. Further, the Scheme requires that no equity incentives (including share rights and restricted shares) remain on foot after implementation of the Scheme, and the usual performance and deferral periods associated with Origin's equity incentives are beyond the likely timing of the proposed Scheme. Accordingly, the Board has approved the following changes:\n\n- \u00b7 Deferred STI - the FY2023 Deferred STI award (to be granted in September 2023) will be made in the form of Deferred Cash, subject to the usual deferral periods. See Section 3.4 for further details.\n- \u00b7 LTIP - the LTIP award (also to be granted in September 2023) will be made in the form of Deferred Cash, subject to a three-year deferral. Further, it will be granted at a level equivalent to 75 per cent of the current opportunity level. It will also be subject to financial and non-financial underpin conditions. See Section 3.5 for more details.\n\nThere are no other changes planned to the remuneration framework for FY2024.",

This includes the legislated increase to the Superannuation Guarantee Levy effective from 1 July 2023 and is consistent with prevailing market movements, economic conditions and benchmarks.\n\nLTI vests that will occur during FY2024 include those for awards granted in November 2020. These awards will vest in full commencing at the end of August 2023. Further details are provided in Section 4.2.4.\n\nThe Board's view is that the remuneration outcomes over the last few years have appropriately aligned with business performance and shareholder experience, as intended by the remuneration framework design.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Steven Sargent\n\nChairman, Remuneration, People and Culture Committee",

Origin believes that observance of its values and leadership behaviours, and the quality of its relationships with its customers and the community, are inextricably linked to the creation of shareholder value. Prior to making remuneration determinations, the full Board conducts formal reviews of management that incorporate individual performance, risk management and leadership behaviours. The Board may adjust variable outcomes up or down.\n\n## 2.3 Minimum Shareholding Requirement for Executive Key Management Personnel\n\nA key objective of the remuneration framework is to promote employee share ownership and to encourage employees to think and act as owners. Equity is therefore a key element of remuneration, representing half of STI awards and the whole of LTI awards. This is supplemented by other share plan arrangements, including salary sacrifice, share purchase and matching plans (see Section 3.7).\n\nExecutive KMP are required to build and maintain a substantial shareholding in the Company (that is, the Minimum Shareholding Requirement (MSR)). Executives are not expected to purchase shares to meet the requirement. The MSR operates as an additional trading restriction, which prevents the disposal of shares that have been generated from executive share plans (other than to cover arising tax liabilities) until the MSR has been achieved and maintained. The requirement would normally be achieved within four years of the first equity grant following appointment.\n\nThe MSR is referenced to one of two nominal multiples of FR, one for the CEO and one applicable to all Other Executive KMP. Following changes to the LTIP in August 2020, the reference multiples are scheduled to increase from 200 per cent of the FR to 250 per cent of the FR for the CEO, and from 100 per cent to 150 per cent of the FR for Other Executive KMP. The scheduled increase will be effective after August 2023, which is the earliest date the new plan can begin to impact vesting patterns.\n\nFor transparency, simplicity and practicability, 1 the MSR is expressed as a number of shares rather than a dollar value. From time to time, the Board changes this number, which is determined by taking into account changes in FR, changes to STI deferral or LTI opportunity levels, and the medium-term share price trend. The current determinations of 620,000 shares (CEO) and 130,000 shares (Other Executive KMP) are scheduled to increase to 720,000 and 160,000, respectively, in 2024.\n\nShare rights awarded under incentive plans do not count towards the MSR obligation.\n\nTable 7.4 (a) shows that the CEO and Executive KMP exceed both the current and FY2024 MSR requirements.",

        "page_content": "## 3 Remuneration framework details\n\n## 3.1 Fixed Remuneration\n\nFR comprises cash salary, employer contributions to superannuation and salary sacrifice benefits. It takes into account the size and complexity of the role, and the skills and experience required for success in the role.\n\nFR is reviewed annually, but increases are not guaranteed. Roles are benchmarked to the median of corresponding roles in organisations with comparable activity and scale, and with which Origin competes for talent. 2 In the absence of special factors, new or newly promoted incumbents generally commence below this reference point and move to the median over time. FR may be positioned above this reference point where it is appropriate to reward sustained high performance, for key talent retention or where it is necessary to attract and secure key skills to fill a business-critical role. Accordingly, the individual positioning may vary between approximately the 40th and 60th percentile of the reference market.\n\n## 3.2 Variable Remuneration\n\nVariable Remuneration (VR) enables pay to be adjusted upwards or downwards, depending on whether performance outcomes exceed or fall short of expectations. Unlike bonus systems that pay for performance above expectations but do not reduce pay where performance falls short, VR does both. It is important to note that the total of FR plus VR is set and benchmarked such that the at target outcome represents the satisfaction of expected performance.\n\nVR comprises the total of STI and LTI:\n\n- \u00b7 The minimum VR is zero, where no STI or LTI is awarded, or where the STI scorecard outcome is zero and LTI is not awarded or all of it fails to vest, or where discretion is exercised to reduce such awards or vesting outcomes to zero.\n- \u00b7 The target VR represents the total of STI when it is awarded at the target level (60 per cent of maximum), plus the risked value of LTI of the share rights awarded at face value 3 (the present-day value of the probabilistic vesting outcome). The risked value of the Performance Share Rights (PSRs) subject to a Relative TSR performance condition is 50 per cent of face value (supported by actuarial grant date valuations over time). The risked value of Restricted Share Rights (RSRs) is considered for this purpose to be 100 per cent of face value. With the same number of rights awarded equally, the overall risked value is therefore 75 per cent of the face value. Accordingly, Target VR = (STI at 60 per cent of maximum) + (LTI at 75 per cent of face value allocation).\n- \u00b7 The maximum VR is the total of STI awarded at the maximum level, plus the full face value of all LTI assuming 100 per cent vesting.\n\nVR outcomes are subject to Board oversight and discretionary adjustment, as summarised in Sections 4.2 and 5.3.\n\nFor LTI grants in FY2024 only, the LTI allocation will be granted in Deferred Cash rather than share rights. Accordingly it will be granted at 75 per cent of the level at which it would have been made had it been granted in the form of share rights. In this instance, the maximum LTI value is reduced to, and is the same as, the target LTI value.\n\n## 3.3 Total Remuneration\n\nTotal Remuneration (TR) is the sum of FR and VR.\n\n| TR at target (TRT)   | =   | FR   | target VR   |\n|----------------------|-----|------|-------------|\n| TR maximum (TRM)     | =   | FR   | maximum VR  |\n\nTRT is benchmarked to the median of equivalent TRT in the reference market, with the intention that when Origin's outcomes are at their maximum possible (that is, TRM), they will be comparable to the top quartile of the reference TRT.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Straight-line pro-rata vesting applies between these two points. In contrast to the PSR tranche, which is conditional on performance against a single external financial metric, the  RSR tranche is designed to vest in full unless there is a material deviation from Board expectations of performance  across approximately 30 key metrics. These metrics reflect the underlying health, performance and sustainability of the  Company and, since FY2021, are reported annually as the Key Sustainability Performance Measures in the Company's  annual Sustainability Report.

As noted in Section 3.2, the allocations will be at the target (risked) opportunity level.  For the CEO, this will be at 90% FR (instead of 120%), and for Other Executive KMP at 60% FR (instead of 80% FR).  The previous financial metric (Relative TSR) is not practicable in the current market circumstances. Accordingly, for  FY2024 only, the underpin arrangements that have previously applied to non-financial metrics will be extended to apply  to financial metrics.  These awards will have a simple three-year vesting period, recognising that the rationale for further  exposure to long-term share price movement has been altered, and that the FY2024 award focus is on retention in the  early post-transaction phase.                                                                                                                                                 |",

The remuneration mix at target and at maximum is shown in the table below, which shows the significant proportion of variable or performance-based pay and delivery in equity. Variable or performance-based pay represents 65.5 per cent of the CEO's package at target outcomes, and 74.2 per cent at maximum outcomes. Forfeitable equity represents 48.3 per cent at target outcomes and 52.6 per cent at maximum outcomes.

For every two shares purchased under the salary sacrifice scheme within a 12-month cycle, participants are granted one Matching Right (MR) at no cost. The MRs vest two years after the cycle began, provided that the participant remains employed by the Company at this time. Each MR entitles the participant to one fully paid ordinary share in the Company, or in certain limited circumstances a cash equivalent payment. The MRs do not have any performance hurdles as they have been granted to encourage broad participation in the scheme across the Company, and to encourage employee share ownership. All shares are currently purchased on market.\n\nDirectors are not eligible to participate in the above schemes, but may participate in the NED Share Plan (NEDSP) by sacrificing Board fees. This plan is intended to facilitate share acquisition, enabling new Directors to meet their MSR obligations. All NEDs currently meet their MSR or are recently appointed. In FY2023, there was one participant who received an allocation of shares under the plan.\n\nDirectors regularly assess the risk of the Company losing high-performing key people who manage core activities or have skills that are being actively solicited in the market. Where appropriate, the Board may consider the selected use of deferred payment arrangements to reduce the risk of such critical loss. From time to time, it may be necessary to offer sign-on equity to offset or mirror unvested equity, which a prospective executive must forfeit to take up employment with Origin.\n\nFollowing the receipt on 9 November 2022 of an indicative, conditional and non-binding proposal from the Consortium consisting of Brookfield and MidOcean Energy to acquire all the issued shares in Origin by way of a scheme of arrangement, targeted retention arrangements (valued at $17 million) were put in place in December 2022 that covered 232 employees who were deemed critical to continuing safe operations. These arrangements focused on operational roles, especially those ineligible for Deferred STI and LTI participation, which afford ongoing retention value. However, one member of the Executive KMP (Executive General Manager, Integrated Gas) was included due to the unique characteristics of the proposed transaction and the criticality of stewardship in the period ahead (refer to the disclosure in statutory table 7-2 (a)).\n\nThe operation of the share plans has been suspended and no awards are expected to be made under them during FY2024.",

The starting points for setting STI scorecard targets are the relevant underlying measures from the financial accounts. Targets set at the beginning of the year may be subject to events materially outside the course of business and outside the control of the current management, in which case discretion may be required to vary targets or outcomes to reflect the intended purpose and/or actual results and achievements. The principles provide a structured process for the consideration of adjustments and the exercise of discretion, and a decision framework that seeks fairness (to both Executives and shareholders) and balance between favourable and unfavourable events.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "Application of the principles described in Section 4.2.1 included the following:\n\n- \u00b7 The one-off and unplanned financial impacts of the sale of Beetaloo and Canning were excluded.\n- \u00b7 Penalties and legal costs associated with regulatory action excluded from underlying financial measures, were included for the purposes of calculating the relevant metrics.\n- \u00b7 The extremity of the La Ni\u00f1a weather events experienced during FY2023 had material impacts to the performance of APLNG beyond the control of management, adversely impacting the upstream operator's ability to access well sites to perform drilling, workover and maintenance activities. The normal practice is not to make adjustments to remuneration metrics for weather events that are within the forecastable or experiential range; however, the extremity of the impacts this year was well outside that range. The Board determined that it would be appropriate to adjust for the atypical impact on this occasion. This affected the APLNG Production and Lowest Cost of Supply metrics. In making the determination the Board noted management's exceptional responses to achieve rapid recovery.\n\n## 4.2.3 Executive Key Management Personnel Short Term Incentive outcomes\n\nOrigin's NPBT and NCOIA targets, and therefore results, represent half of the financial metrics for all Executive KMP. The remaining financial metrics for divisional Executive General Managers are based on divisional targets. Accordingly, scorecard outcomes ranged between 74.0 per cent to 90.2 per cent of the maximum.\n\n|               | STI award   | STI award    | STI award   | STI award   |\n|---------------|-------------|--------------|-------------|-------------|\n| Executive KMP | % of target | % of maximum | % forfeited | $'000       |\n| F Calabria    | 125.8       | 75.3         | 24.7        | 2,459       |\n| L Tremaine    | 127.0       | 76.0         | 24.0        | 1,371       |\n| J Briskin     | 142.0       | 85.0         | 15.0        | 1,360       |\n| G Jarvis      | 150.6       | 90.2         | 9.8         | 1,460       |\n| A Thornton    | 123.6       | 74.0         | 26.0        | 1,127       |\n\n## 4.2.4 Long-term performance and Long Term Incentive outcomes\n\nIn FY2023, the Company's share price increased 46.8 per cent (on top of 27.1 per cent in the prior year), and the three-year rolling TSR was 74.0 per cent (CAGR 20.3 per cent pa). The strong operational annual performance is complemented by stabilisation and growth over the last five years, reflected in the return to partial LTI vesting in FY2021 following eight consecutive years of nil vesting.\n\nLTI awards partially vested (16.0 per cent) during FY2023. Testing involved four different performance measures. Options granted in the 2017 calendar year were conditional on Relative TSR (RTSR) performance over five years - as measured against a peer group of 'ten-up/ten-down' companies in terms of market capitalisation. Origin's TSR performance over that period failed to exceed the 50th percentile ranking, therefore these awards lapsed. Half of the PSRs granted in the 2019 calendar year were conditional on RTSR performance over three years, as measured against the S&P/ASX 50 peer group. This award also failed to exceed the 50th percentile ranking in the peer group, therefore it also lapsed. The other half of the 2019 calendar year PSRs was conditional on ROCE performance over three years, measured separately in the Energy Markets and Integrated Gas business units (equally weighted). The target for Energy Markets was a three-year average ROCE (measured on an LTIP basis) of 9.24 per cent. With an actual average outcome of 4.32 per cent this component failed to vest and lapsed. The target for Integrated Gas was a three-year average ROCE of 7.09 per cent. The actual achieved was 9.03 per cent, which approached the stretch target of 9.09 per cent. Accordingly, this component vested at 98.5 per cent. The overall vesting outcome for executives depended on the relative levels of individual awards received by executives in the 2017 and 2019 calendar years. The overall average was 16.0 per cent. Awards that vested were settled in Restricted Shares (RSs) subject to an additional year of deferral (trading restriction).\n\nAs identified in the Letter from the Chairman of the Remuneration, People and Culture Committee, LTI vests that will occur during FY2024 include those for awards granted in November 2020. These awards will vest in full commencing at the end of August 2023. Half of that grant was awarded as Performance Share Rights (PSRs) subject to a financial market condition (Relative TSR) vesting between 0 per cent and 100 per cent depending on Origin's TSR over three years relative to the peer group (S&P/ASX-50). Origin's TSR over the period was determined independently to be 74.04 per cent and at the 82.9th percentile of the peer group, resulting in 100 per cent vesting. The other half of the grant was awarded as RSRs which vest subject to the review process described in Section 3.5. At the end of the year the Board conducted an Executive Performance Review (summarised in Section 5.3), considering business and individual performance, risk assessment, together with a three-year lookback (FY2021-FY2023 inclusive) over a holistic suite of metrics reflecting the underlying health, performance and sustainability of its businesses and the Company overall. Following those reviews the Board determined that performance was strong and without material deviation from its expectations. Specific reference was made to the Key Sustainability Performance Measures reported in the Company's Sustainability Reports. Following those reviews the Board determined full vesting for the RSRs. The PSRs vest into Restricted Shares with a two-year trading restriction, and the RSRs vest progressively (one third in August 2023, with a two-year holding lock, the next one-third in August 2024 with a one-year holding lock, and the final one-third is scheduled to vest in August 2025).\n\nThe trend in long-term performance outcomes aligns with the long-term performance of the business and with shareholder experience.\n\n<!-- image -->",

It operates under a Charter (published on the Company's website at originenergy.com.au). The RPCC met formally five times during the reporting period.\n\nIncluding its Chairman, the RPCC has four members, all of whom are independent NEDs (see Section 1 for details). The RPCC's Charter requires a minimum of three NEDs. In addition, there is a standing invitation to all Board members to attend the RPCC's meetings. Management may attend RPCC meetings by invitation, but a member of management will not be present when their own remuneration is under discussion.\n\nThe following diagram sets out the role of the RPCC and its operational relationships with the Board, management, stakeholders and external advisors.\n\n## 5.2 Remuneration advisors\n\nThe RPCC engages external advisors from time to time to conduct benchmarking, advise on regulatory and market developments, and review proposals and reports. Protocols have been established for engaging and dealing with external advisors, including those defined as remuneration consultants for the purposes of the Act. These protocols are to ensure independence and avoid conflicts of interest.\n\nThe protocols require that remuneration advisors are directly engaged by the RPCC and act on instruction from its Chairman. Reports must be delivered directly to the RPCC Chairman. The advisor is prohibited from communicating with Company management, except as authorised by the Chairman, and even then, this is limited to the provision or validation of factual and policy data. The advisor must furnish a statement confirming the absence of any undue influence from management.\n\nThe RPCC generally seeks information rather than specific remuneration recommendations within the definition of the Act, and this was the case during FY2023. Guerdon Associates was appointed for this period - no remuneration recommendations as defined under the Act were provided.\n\nIn addition, the RPCC makes use of general market trend information from a variety of commercial and industry sources, and has access to in-house remuneration professionals who provide it with guidance and analysis on request.\n\nThe recommendations that the RPCC makes to the Board are based on its own independent assessment of the advice and information received from these multiple sources, using its experience and having careful regard to the principles and objectives of the remuneration framework, Company's performance, shareholder and community expectations, and good governance.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Its processes in overseeing performance and remuneration can be divided into the stages set out below, which are designed to ensure that outcomes are fair to executives and stakeholders, consistent in approach, and governed by documented principles.\n\n## 5.3.1 Through the performance period\n\nThroughout the STI performance year and LTI vesting periods, the Board monitors and reviews management performance against financial and non-financial targets, including factors affecting the original assumptions underlying the setting of targets at the beginning of the relevant performance periods.\n\nPotential adjustments that may be required are considered under a set of protocols that cover materiality, symmetry of treatment for favourable and unfavourable events, the degree to which events are foreseeable and controllable by management, and the impact of Board decisions (for example, mergers and acquisitions). Any adjustments are subject to Board approval at the end of the performance period.\n\nThe outcome from this stage comprises preliminary STI outcomes and preliminary LTI vesting outcomes.\n\n## 5.3.2 At the end of the financial year\n\nAt the end of each financial year, the full Board conducts a formal Executive Performance Review of the CEO and each member of the ELT, including the preliminary remuneration outcomes. The review is a formal and holistic process that considers:\n\n- \u00b7 risk, audit, compliance and reputation matters (including whistle-blowing, discrimination, bullying or harassment complaints, and safety and employee relations matters);\n- \u00b7 enterprise and business strategy contribution; and\n- \u00b7 leadership habits and behaviours.\n\nThe process includes taking feedback from the:\n\n- \u00b7 Chair of the Health, Safety and Environment Committee;\n- \u00b7 Chair of the Audit Committee;\n- \u00b7 Internal Auditor;\n- \u00b7 General Counsel and EGM Company Secretariat, Risk and Governance; and\n- \u00b7 Executive General Manager, People and Culture. 5\n\nAs a performance review process, the output includes performance feedback and identifies specifically whether there are any matters that warrant the exercise of downward discretion to modify individual executives' preliminary remuneration outcomes. In exceptional circumstances, the Board may exercise upward discretion, within the capped opportunity level.\n\nDuring this stage, the Board will also consider whether any exercises of discretion are appropriate on a collective basis, and in the overall context of ensuring that the outcomes represent a reasonable and fair reflection of the Company's performance from the perspective of all stakeholders.\n\nThe output from this stage comprises final STI outcomes and final LTI vesting decisions.\n\n## 5.3.3 Beyond the performance period\n\nIssues may emerge after final results have been notified where the Board deems that those results are no longer appropriate, or that the results would give rise to receiving an inappropriate benefit. Where such issues emerge before payment has been made or before rights have vested or shares have been released from trading locks, the Board may reduce or cancel the award or the vesting level, and/or extend the period of a trading lock under the Company's malus provisions. The deferral period for equity (two years for STI and five years for all tranches of LTI) means that the exercise of malus is available for significant periods of time.\n\nWhere benefits have been paid, vested or released, the Company's clawback provisions give the Board further powers to recover cash proceeds from the sale of shares and to recover cash awards. These powers may be limited by statute or regulation.\n\nOf course, fraud, dishonesty, gross misconduct, negligence, breach of duties and other serious matters would have consequences additional to the remuneration impacts described above.\n\nDownward discretions have been exercised by the Board from time to time, both to STI outcomes and to LTI allocations or vesting outcomes, to provide better alignment of variable pay outcomes with the broader context and overall circumstances of the Company. There have been no circumstances to date in which the Board has sought to apply the clawback provisions.\n\n## 5.4 Change of control and capital reorganisation\n\nIf a change of control event occurs, the Board may determine that all or a specified number of unvested or restricted deferred incentives will vest or cease to be subject to restrictions.\n\nOn a capital reorganisation, the Board may determine the manner of adjustment of the number of unvested Share Rights and Options held by participants to minimise or eliminate any material advantage or disadvantage to the participant. If new awards are granted, they will, unless the Board determines otherwise, be subject to the same terms and conditions as the original awards.",

        "page_content": "## 6 Non-executive Director fees\n\n## 6.1 Remuneration policy and structure for Non-executive Directors\n\nNED remuneration comprises fixed fees with no incentive-based payments. This ensures that NEDs can independently and objectively assess both Executive and Company performance.\n\nBoard and committee fees take into account market rates for similar positions at relevant Australian organisations (of comparable size and complexity) and fairly reflect the time commitments and responsibilities involved. The aggregate cap for overall NED remuneration remains at $3.2 million pa, as approved by shareholders in 2017.\n\nThe Origin Chairman receives a single fee that includes committee activities, while other NEDs receive a NED Base Fee and separate fees for their role on specific committees (other than the Nomination Committee, which is considered within the NED Base Fee). All fees include superannuation contributions.\n\nThe table below summarises the structure and level of NED fees. No change to the fee structure or quantum is proposed for FY2024.\n\nTable 7-4 (b) shows that all NEDs meet the current MSR obligation.\n\n| Office                                                        | FY2022 and FY2023 ($'000)   | FY2022 and FY2023 ($'000)   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|\n|                                                               | Chairman                    | Member                      |\n| Board                                                         | 677 1                       | 196                         |\n| Audit Committee                                               | 57                          | 29                          |\n| RPCC, Safety and Sustainability Committee, and Risk Committee | 47                          | 23.5                        |\n| Nomination Committee                                          | nil                         | nil                         |\n\n## 6.2 Minimum Shareholding Requirement for Non-executive Directors\n\nTo align the interests of the Board with those of shareholders, NEDs are required to build and maintain a substantive shareholding in the Company (the MSR). NEDs may purchase shares directly or through the NEDSP that was last approved by shareholders in 2022. The NEDSP is a fee sacrifice plan that allows NEDs to acquire share rights (rights to acquire fully paid ordinary shares in the Company) subject to the terms of the grant. The NEDSP is intended to facilitate the acquisition of shares for new Directors to meet their MSR obligation while recognising that opportunities for direct purchases by Directors may be limited. NEDs are expected to reach their MSR within three years of their appointment.\n\nDuring FY2023, one NED received a share allocation under the NEDSP in respect of the fees sacrificed during FY2022.\n\nThe NED MSR is determined from time to time as a number of shares referenced to a nominal multiple of fees. The determination takes into account changes in fees and share prices over time. The nominal reference multiple is 100 per cent of the annual base NED fee for all NEDs except for the Chairman of the Board, where it is 200 per cent of the annual base NED fee. The current share determinations of 28,000 shares for NEDs and 56,000 shares for the Chairman are to be increased to 36,000 and 72,000, respectively, from August 2024.\n\nShare rights held by NEDs under the NEDSP will count towards the satisfaction of NED MSR obligations because they are funded through sacrifice of fees by the participating Director. The shares allocated on vesting of the share rights are bought on market on behalf of the Director and are not subject to forfeiture.\n\n<!-- image -->",

cash represents one half of the STI award. STI cash is paid after the end of the financial year to which it relates but is allocated to the earning year. The balance of the STI award is Deferred STI.\n- 3 Movement in leave provision over the reporting period. Negative movement indicates that leave taken during the year exceeded leave accrued during the current year.\n- 4 For FY2023 Deferred STI is delivered in the form of deferred cash arrangements.\n- 5 Share-based incentives include Restricted Shares, PSR and RSRs granted as Deferred STI or LTI respectively. Share-based remuneration is that portion of the accounting value of equity granted or to be granted for the current and prior periods attributable to the reporting period. Where vesting of the equity is conditional on a non-market hurdle (for example, ROCE, or the underpinning metrics in the LTI RSR tranche) in following reporting periods, the accumulated expense is adjusted for the number of instruments then expected to be released or vested. In good leaver circumstances, a bring-forward of future-period accounting expense may occur where a cessation of employment occurs before the normal vesting date. See Note G3 for details on share-based remuneration accounting.\n- 6 For FY2023, Cash STI also includes the value of the deferred remuneration retention arrangement ($450,000 conditionally payable after three years) attributable to the period. For FY2022, the pro-rata period for KMP office was from 1 November 2021 to 30 June 2022.",

        "page_content": "## Overview\n\nOrigin Energy Limited (the Company) is a for-profit company domiciled in Australia. The address of the Company's registered office is Level 32, Tower 1, 100 Barangaroo Avenue, Barangaroo NSW 2000. The nature of the operations and principal activities of the Company and its controlled entities (the Group or Origin) are described in the segment information in note A1.\n\nOn 17 August 2023, the Directors resolved to authorise the issue of these consolidated general purpose financial statements for the year ended 30 June 2023.\n\n## Basis of preparation\n\nThe financial statements have been prepared:\n\n- \u00b7 in accordance with the requirements of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth), Australian Accounting Standards and other authoritative pronouncements of the Australian Accounting Standards Board (AASB), and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board;\n- \u00b7 on a historical cost basis, except for derivatives and other financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value; and\n- \u00b7 on a going concern basis.\n\nThe financial statements:\n\n- \u00b7 are presented in Australian dollars;\n- \u00b7 are rounded to the nearest million dollars, unless otherwise stated, in accordance with Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) Corporations (Rounding in Financial/ Directors' Reports) Instrument 2016/191;\n- \u00b7 do not early adopt any Accounting Standards and Interpretations that have been issued or amended but are not yet effective; and\n- \u00b7 present reclassified comparative information where required for consistency with the current period's presentation.\n\n## New standards and interpretations not yet adopted\n\nA number of new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations are effective for annual periods beginning after 1 July 2023, which have not been applied in preparing the Group's financial statements. None of these are expected to have a significant effect on the Group with the exception of AASB 20232 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards International Tax Reform - Pillar Two Model Rules.\n\nOn 27 June 2023, the AASB issued amendments to AASB 112 Income Taxes . The amendments to AASB 112 give companies temporary relief from accounting for deferred taxes arising from the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development's international tax reform (Pillar Two income taxes) and also introduce qualitative and quantitative disclosures to assist the users of financial statements to better understand a company's exposure to income taxes arising from the reform, particularly before legislation implementing the rules is in effect. The temporary relief from accounting for deferred taxes was applicable immediately and retrospectively upon issue of the amendments while the disclosure requirements are effective for the Group for reporting periods beginning 1 July 2023.\n\nThe Group has applied the temporary relief from accounting for and disclosing information about deferred tax assets and liabilities related to Pillar Two income taxes.\n\nAs at the reporting date, the Group continues to monitor the developments around the implementation and enactment of Pillar Two income taxes in the jurisdictions it operates in and the detailed impact assessment of the amendments to AASB 112 is ongoing.\n\n## Use of judgements and estimates\n\nPreparing the financial statements in conformity with Australian Accounting Standards requires management to make judgements and apply estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. The estimates and associated assumptions, which are based on historical experience and various other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, form the basis of judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Throughout the notes to the financial statements, further information is provided about key management judgements and estimates that we consider material to the financial statements.\n\n## The Group's operating environment\n\nIn the prior year, the Group's operating environment experienced very challenging energy market conditions, with high prices and periods of supply constraints. This was most evident with the Ukraine war and the move by many countries away from importing energy from Russia. This drove higher global energy prices and caused countries to place greater national importance on energy security.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThese factors have had wider impacts on consumers, businesses and the overall economy.\n\nThe Group's operating environment has become less volatile with a lower commodity price environment in the current year.\n\nThe economic impacts of the changes in the Group's operating environment due to market conditions have implications for various line items in the financial statements.\n\n## Binding Scheme Implementation Deed\n\nOn 27 March 2023 the Company entered into a binding Scheme Implementation Deed (the Scheme) with the Consortium comprising affiliates of Brookfield Renewable Partners L.P. (Brookfield Renewable), together with its institutional partners and certain other global institutional investors, and MidOcean Energy, an entity managed by EIG Partners, for the acquisition of all the issued shares in the Company (the Scheme Transaction). Subject to the conditions of the Scheme, Brookfield Renewable and its institutional partners and investors will own the Energy Markets business and Corporate functions and MidOcean Energy will acquire the Integrated Gas business which includes Origin's investment in APLNG.\n\nThe Company and the Consortium are targeting implementation of the Scheme by early in the 2024 calendar year. The actual timing for implementation of the Scheme will depend on the timing for satisfaction of the required regulatory and shareholder approvals. The Consortium lodged an application with the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission on 5 June 2023, in accordance with the terms of the Scheme.\n\n## Climate change\n\nOrigin's ambition is to lead the energy transition through cleaner energy and customer solutions. With a long-term ambition to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050, the Group is committed to progressively decarbonising its business and providing the solutions to help customers transition to a low-carbon future.\n\nThe Group has identified certain key physical and transition risks relating to climate change. These include potential changes in market supply and demand for energy, government policy and regulation in relation to climate change, extreme weather events and other",

We recognise that there is significant uncertainty around the pace of decarbonisation and differing pathways to net zero across the global economy. Future changes to the Group's ambition or realisation of global decarbonisation ambitions quicker or more slowly than currently anticipated may impact some of the Group's significant judgements and key estimates.\n\nIn preparing the financial statements, the key judgements and estimates consider a range of economic conditions that are forecast to exist over the remaining useful lives of the Group's assets, including expectations about future operations, the current outlook for commodity prices, discount rates, capital expenditure requirements and market supply and demand profiles. Climate change-related risks will impact those areas of the financial statements that are subject to estimation uncertainties and can also introduce more volatility in assets and liabilities carried at fair value.\n\nClimate change-related risks impact the significant judgements and estimates in the following notes to the financial statements:\n\n- \u00b7 B2 - Investment in APLNG\n- \u00b7 C3 - Property, plant and equipment\n- \u00b7 C4 - Intangible assets\n- \u00b7 C5 - Provisions - restoration\n- \u00b7 C7 - Impairment of non-current assets\n- \u00b7 D5 - Fair value of financial assets and liabilities\n\nIn February 2022, the Group announced plans to accelerate its exit from coal-fired power generation submitting notice to the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) of its intention to bring forward the closure of the Eraring Power Station (Eraring) to as early as August 2025. Prevailing market conditions will continue to be assessed which will help inform the final timing for closure of all four units at Eraring.\n\nAs at 30 June 2023 and consistent with the prior year, a closure date of August 2025, the end of the required three and a half year notice period to AEMO, remains the Group's best estimate of useful life and has been used in the accounting assessments presented within these financial statements;\n\nnamely, the recoverable amount estimates in the Energy Markets Generation CGU (note C7), useful life assumptions of Eraring in calculating depreciation expense (note C3) and timing of associated restoration activities recognised in the provision balance (note C5).\n\nThe Group recognises the increase in legislative momentum to address climate change-related risks and opportunities, including the Australian Government's emissions reduction target legislated in September 2022 and the amendments to the Safeguard Mechanism which have come into force mid-2023. The Group has considered the impact of these legislative requirements in line with accounting standard requirements, with no impairment required as at 30 June 2023 due to the introduction of the Safeguard Mechanism.\n\n## Paris Agreement and climate scenarios\n\nThe Group unequivocally supports the goal of the Paris Agreement and believes the world must pursue efforts to limit global average temperature rise to 1.5\u00b0C above preindustrial levels. The Group recognises that there are a range of possible energy transition scenarios that align to this goal.\n\nIn line with our commitment at the 2022 Annual General Meeting, we have disclosed the estimates and judgements used in presenting a quantified climate analysis. The Group's climate scenarios disclosed are based on the following:\n\n- \u00b7 International Energy Agency (IEA) Net Zero Emissions by 2050 scenario (NZE) as presented in their World Energy Outlook 2022 (WEO 2022) (November 2022) publication.\n- \u00b7 Wood Mackenzie 1 (Woodmac) 2022 Accelerated energy transition 1.5degree scenario (2022 AET-1.5\u00b0C).\n- \u00b7 IEA Announced Pledges scenario (APS) (WEO 2022).\n\nBoth the IEA NZE and Woodmac 2022 AET-1.5\u00b0C scenarios are intended to be consistent with the goal of the Paris Agreement to limit average temperature rise to 1.5\u00b0C.\n\nHowever, the Group recognises that globally we may not be on a trajectory consistent with the IEA NZE 1.5\u00b0C pathway and therefore have also included the IEA APS scenario. The APS scenario considers the impact of all pledges announced as of September 2022 by governments to meet net zero goals, and is estimated to limit the global average temperature rise to 1.7\u00b0C.\n\n## Climate scenarios - assumptions and methodology\n\nAlthough all potential financial reporting consequences under any climate scenario are impracticable to fully assess, the Group has used the following assumptions in order to assess the impact of a climate scenario to the financial statements.\n\nIEA APS and IEA NZE Scenarios\n\nThe IEA APS and IEA NZE scenarios released in the WEO 2022 present commodity pricing starting from historical market balances in 2021. To reflect the economic challenges the business will face in the energy transition, the Group has used the oil, LNG and carbon prices from the Group's FY2024 base case assumptions used for impairment assessment and assumed a straight-line interpolation to the earliest subsequent period provided by the IEA APS and IEA NZE scenarios. A straightline interpolation is then assumed between each of the IEA price points provided up to 2050, where prices are held flat for any subsequent periods. As all prices presented in the IEA WEO 2022 are 2021 real unit pricing, the Group has adjusted these prices by an assumed 2.5% per annum inflation factor to reflect 2023 real unit pricing.\n\nWoodmac 2022 AET-1.5\u00b0C Scenario\n\nThe Woodmac 2022 AET-1.5\u00b0C scenario presents commodity pricing for each year through to 2050 based on 2022 real unit pricing. For use in the Group's scenario analysis, these prices have been uplifted by an assumed 2.5% inflation factor to reflect 2023 real unit pricing. No other adjustments have been made to the Woodmac 2022 AET-1.5\u00b0C commodity pricing.\n\nLimitations of scenario analysis\n\nScenarios do not constitute definitive outcomes or probabilities, and scenario analysis relies on assumptions that may or may not be, or prove to be, correct and may or may not eventuate. Scenarios may also be impacted by additional factors to the assumptions disclosed.\n\nWhile each of the climate scenarios presented are founded on differing assumptions, central themes across each of these scenarios include the need for swift policy action, technological uplift, and investment in the energy transition on an unprecedented global scale. It is difficult to predict, which if any, of these assumptions and scenarios may eventuate.\n\nFurthermore, the IEA has recognised that the transition is extremely challenging and that globally we are not on the IEA NZE pathway.",

        "page_content": "## Overview (continued)\n\nThe Group's base case assumptions used for impairment consider the most current observable and actual market conditions to develop management's best estimate of future economic outcomes as required by the Accounting Standards. Therefore in its design, the Group's base case assumptions used for impairment differ to the key assumptions used in the scenarios presented in the climate analysis.\n\nNotwithstanding, the Group will continue to take action across the business both now and beyond 2030 with the ambition of reaching net zero Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions across our value chain by 2050.\n\n## Commodity price assumptions 2\n\nThe commodity prices used in the climate scenarios are as follows (presented in 2023 real unit pricing):\n\nBrent Oil\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nLNG\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe AEMO 'Strong Electrification' scenario per their 2022 Electricity Statement of Opportunities (August 2022) (ESOO) publication provides supply and demand forecasts for both the gas and electricity sector that are aligned with the IEA NZE scenario. The AEMO 'Strong Electrification' forecasts are used in conjunction with the IEA NZE commodity assumptions in the graphs above to develop relevant energy market pricing.\n\nIn presenting the quantified climate analyses, we have assumed in all climate scenarios that carbon pricing has been applied to Scope 1 emissions above the estimated Safeguard Mechanism facility baseline and all Scope 2 emissions. For the IEA NZE and Woodmac 2022 AET-1.5\u00b0C scenarios, the Group has also assumed a net zero grid by 2035 and therefore has no Scope 2 emissions beyond 2035. This is intended to be consistent with the economic principles that support the AEMO 'Strong Electrification' scenario and has therefore been applied when modelling these selected 1.5\u00b0C scenarios.\n\nThe quantified impact of applying the climate scenarios to the financial statements are as follows:\n\n## Energy Markets\n\nFor Energy Markets, the application of the IEA NZE and AEMO 'Strong Electrification' climate scenarios result in a net favourable position compared to the outlook from the base case assumptions used for impairment, benefiting existing assets such as the peaking generation fleet and Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs). Increased electrification of the National Electricity Market (NEM) and other growth areas such as electric vehicle penetration and an increase in connected services as customers decarbonise their homes will\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nprovide further opportunities for the retail business. The climate scenario valuation assumes closure of Eraring in August 2025, which therefore limits the exposure of the carrying value of assets in the Energy Markets segment to long-term commodity price movements. There is no expected impact to the useful lives of the remaining assets or restoration and rehabilitation provisions under the IEA NZE scenario.\n\nAccounting standards require any decision as to impairments or reversals to be based on management's best estimate of economic conditions over the assets remaining useful life. Given the IEA NZE scenario is not viewed as the most likely economic outcome, it is not an appropriate basis on which to determine or quantify impairment or potential impairment reversals. Historical impairments within the Energy Markets segment have largely pertained to goodwill, which, in accordance with accounting standards, cannot be reversed.\n\n## Investment in APLNG\n\nFor the Group's investment in APLNG, the outcomes of the climate scenarios are as follows:\n\n|                                                         | $m    |\n|---------------------------------------------------------|-------|\n| Carrying value as at 30 June 2023 Impairment arising in | 5,469 |\n| selected scenarios: IEA APS                             | nil   |\n| Woodmac 2022 AET-1.5\u00b0C                                  | nil   |\n| IEA NZE                                                 | 2,440 |\n\nThe climate analysis disclosed is presented based on the adjustment of pricing assumptions alone, the exception being the IEA NZE and Woodmac 2022 AET-1.5\u00b0C scenarios where no scope 2 emissions are assumed from 2035 onwards. This is intended to be consistent with the assumption of the net zero grid by 2035 applied in the AEMO 'Strong Electrification' scenario. No other adjustments or mitigating actions have been applied and all modelling is conducted in accordance with AASB and IFRS measurement requirements.\n\nIn practice these valuations do not reflect any actions management may take in order to reduce negative outcomes and further grow the business. If presented with such a sustained low-price environment, APLNG would adjust future long-term expenditure, production and operations in order to reduce the overall unfavourable impact, therefore the illustrative impairments presented under the climate scenarios above are likely higher than what would transpire.",

This reflects the way the Group's businesses are managed, rather than the legal structure of the Group.\n\nThe reporting segments are organised according to the nature of the activities undertaken and are detailed below.\n\n- \u00b7 Energy Markets : Energy retailing and wholesaling, power generation and LPG operations predominantly in Australia.\n- \u00b7 Share of Octopus Energy : Origin's investment in Octopus Energy Holdings (Octopus Energy). This investment was previously included in the Energy Markets segment.\n- \u00b7 Integrated Gas : Origin's investment in APLNG, exploration interest in the Cooper-Eromanga Basin and costs associated with growth initiatives such as hydrogen. It also includes overhead costs (net of recoveries from APLNG) and costs incurred in managing Origin's exposure to LNG pricing risk and impacts of its LNG trading positions. For greater transparency, the investment in APLNG is presented separately from the residual component of the segment.\n- \u00b7 Corporate : Various business development and support activities that are not allocated to operating segments, including corporate treasury and tax items.\n\nUnderlying profit and underlying EBITDA are non-statutory (non-IFRS) measures. The objective of measuring and reporting underlying profit and underlying EBITDA is to provide a more meaningful and consistent representation of financial performance by removing items that distort performance or are non-recurring in nature.\n\nItems excluded from the calculation of underlying profit are reported to the Managing Director as not representing the underlying performance of the business and thus are excluded from underlying profit or underlying EBITDA. These items are determined after consideration of the nature of the item, the significance of the amount and the consistency in treatment from period to period.\n\nThe nature of items excluded from underlying profit and underlying EBITDA are shown below.\n\n- \u00b7 Changes in the fair value of financial instruments not in accounting hedge relationships, to remove the significant volatility caused by timing mismatches in valuing financial instruments and the related underlying transactions. The valuation changes are subsequently recognised in underlying earnings when the underlying transactions are settled;\n- \u00b7 Realised and unrealised foreign exchange gains/losses on debt held to hedge USD-denominated investment in APLNG;\n- \u00b7 Significant redundancies and other costs in relation to business restructuring, transformation or integration activities;\n- \u00b7 Gains/losses on the sale or acquisition of an asset/entity;\n- \u00b7 Transaction costs incurred in relation to the sale or acquisition of an entity;\n- \u00b7 Impairments of assets;\n- \u00b7 Significant onerous contracts;\n- \u00b7 Deferred tax liability recognition/ utilisation relating to the APLNG investment;\n- \u00b7 Large-scale Generation Certificates (LGCs) net shortfall charge; and\n- \u00b7 Other significant non-recurring items.",

When determining revenue for the financial period, management estimates the volume of energy supplied since a customer's last bill. The estimation of unbilled consumption requires judgement and is based on various assumptions including:\n\n- \u00b7 volume and timing of energy consumed by customers;\n- \u00b7 allocation of estimated electricity and gas volumes to various pricing plans;\n- \u00b7 discounts linked to customer payment patterns; and\n- \u00b7 loss factors.\n\nManagement also uses unbilled consumption volumes to accrue network expenses incurred by the Group for unread customer electricity and gas meters.\n\nThe calculation of unbilled revenue requires significant judgement in estimating the level of energy consumption by customers during the unbilled period to 30 June 2023. The Group uses a backcasting model and volume-matching process to provide a reliable estimate of unbilled revenue as at 30 June 2023.\n\n## Retail contracts\n\nRetail electricity is generally marketed through standard service offers that provide customers with discounts on published tariff rates. Contract duration can vary with some contracts providing a discount on published rates for a limited term, while other contracts have no fixed duration. Contracts generally require no minimum consumption, and can be terminated by the customer at any time without significant penalty. The supply of energy is considered a single performance obligation for which revenue is recognised upon delivery to customers at the offered rate. Where customers are eligible to receive additional behavioural discounts, Origin considers this to be variable consideration.\n\n## Business and wholesale contracts\n\nContracts with business and wholesale customers are generally medium to long-term, higher-volume arrangements with fixed or index-linked energy rates that have been commercially negotiated. The nature and accounting treatment of this revenue stream is largely consistent with retail sales. Some business and wholesale sales arrangements also include the transfer of renewable energy certificates (RECs), which represent an additional performance obligation. Revenue is recognised for these contracts when Origin has the 'right to invoice' the customer for consideration that corresponds directly with the value of units of energy delivered to the customer. Pool revenue relates to sales by Origin generation assets into the NEM, as well as revenue associated with gross settled PPAs. Origin has assessed it is acting as the principal in relation to transactions with the NEM and therefore recognises pool sales on a gross basis. Revenue from these sales is recognised at the spot price achieved when control of the electricity passes to the grid.",

        "page_content": "## A2 Revenue (continued)\n\n## Solar and Energy services\n\nSolar and Energy Services revenue primarily relates to sales of solar, batteries and Community Energy Services. Solar and batteries revenue includes the sale, installation, repairs and maintenance services of solar photovoltaic systems, and battery solutions, to residential and business customers. Revenue is recognised at the point in time that the system is installed, or the service provided is complete. Community Energy Services supplies electricity and gas within embedded network sites. Similar to retail contracts, the supply of energy is considered a single performance obligation for which revenue is recognised upon delivery to the customers at the offered rate.\n\n## LPG and Integrated Gas\n\nRevenue from the sale of LPG (Energy Markets segment) and LNG (Integrated Gas segment) is recognised at the point in time that the customer takes physical possession of the commodity.

The Group's investment is equity accounted as a result of the Group's active participation on the Board and the Group's ability to impact decision making, leading to the assessment that significant influence exists.\n- 3 PNG Energy Developments Limited was deregistered on 26 October 2022.\n\nOf all the above joint ventures and associates, only the interests in APLNG and Octopus Energy have a material impact on the Group at 30 June 2023.\n\n## B2 Investment in APLNG\n\nThis section provides information on financial information related to the Group's investment in the equity accounted joint venture APLNG.\n\n## B2.1 Summary APLNG income statement\n\n| for the year ended 30 June             | 2023        | 2023              | 2022        | 2022              |\n|----------------------------------------|-------------|-------------------|-------------|-------------------|\n| $m                                     | Total APLNG | Origin interest 1 | Total APLNG | Origin interest 1 |\n| Operating revenue                      | 11,259      |                   | 9,362       |                   |\n| Operating expenses                     | (3,091)     |                   | (2,486)     |                   |\n| EBITDA                                 | 8,168       | 2,246             | 6,876       | 2,134             |\n| Depreciation and amortisation expense  | (1,659)     | (456)             | (1,563)     | (495)             |\n| Interest income                        | 87          | 24                | 9           | 3                 |\n| Interest expense - MRCPS               | -           | -                 | (141)       | (48)              |\n| Other interest expense                 | (440)       | (121)             | (328)       | (105)             |\n| Income tax expense                     | (1,850)     | (509)             | (1,456)     | (445)             |\n| ITDA                                   | (3,862)     | (1,062)           | (3,479)     | (1,090)           |\n| Statutory result for the year          | 4,306       | 1,184             | 3,397       | 1,044             |\n| Other comprehensive income             | -           | -                 | -           | -                 |\n| Statutory total comprehensive income 2 | 4,306       | 1,184             | 3,397       | 1,044             |\n| Underlying profit for the year 3       | 4,306       | 1,184             | 3,397       | 1,044             |\n| Underlying EBITDA for the year 3       | 8,168       | 2,246             | 6,876       | 2,134             |\n\n- 1 Origin's interest is 27.5 per cent.

At the same time, when APLNG paid interest to the Group on MRCPS, the amount was capitalised by APLNG. Therefore, these capitalised interest amounts form part of the cost of APLNG's assets, and these assets have been depreciated since commencement of operations. The proportion attributable to the Group's own interest (37.5 per cent prior to 8 December 2021 and 27.5 per cent thereafter) is eliminated through the equity accounted investment balance.\n- 3 Includes an increase of $245 million due to foreign exchange that has been recognised in the foreign currency translation reserve. Also included is a reduction of A$1,783 million (US$1,198 million) relating to unfranked dividends received from APLNG.\n\nReporting date balances are converted from USD to AUD using an end-of-period exchange rate of 0.6629 (2022: 0.6891).\n\n## Key judgements and estimates\n\nThe carrying amount of the Group's equity accounted investment in APLNG is reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment or reversal of impairment. Where an indicator of impairment exists, a formal estimate of the recoverable amount is made. The Group's assessment of the recoverable amount uses a discounted cash flow methodology and considers a range of macroeconomic and project assumptions, including oil and LNG price, AUD/USD exchange rates, discount rates and costs over the asset's life. No impairment loss or reversal of impairment was recognised during the year.\n\nClimate change is a material risk that can affect the Group's operations through current and future climate-related legislation and policies and climate related scenarios. Future climate related conditions, legislation and policies may have an impact on future commodity prices, foreign exchange rates, discount rates, inflation, global market supply and demand conditions and whether reserve quantities are capable of economic extraction.

The Group incurs costs in providing these services and charges APLNG for them in accordance with the terms of the contracts governing those services.\n\n## Commodity transactions\n\nSeparately, the Group has entered agreements to purchase gas from APLNG (2023: $636 million; 2022: $401 million) and sell gas to APLNG (2023: $40 million; 2022: $17 million). At 30 June 2023, the Group's outstanding payable balance for purchases from APLNG was $59 million (2022: $25 million) and outstanding receivable balance for sales to APLNG was nil (2022: $7 million).\n\n## Funding transactions\n\nThe Group received unfranked dividends of $1,783 million (2022: $433 million.)\n\nOn 18 July 2023 the directors of APLNG determined unfranked dividends to be paid to shareholders. The Group received unfranked dividends of US$65 million (A$98 million) on 26 July 2023.\n\nOn 15 August 2023 the directors of APLNG determined further unfranked dividends to be paid to shareholders. The Group expects to receive US$115 million on 29 August 2023.\n\nIn the prior year, Origin repaid $51 million of the DSRA loan from APLNG under the APLNG project finance debt service reserve account requirements.\n\nIn the prior year the Group received A$1,162 million of MRCPS buy-backs and reflected a reduction in the MRCPS non-current financial asset. Related MRCPS dividends of A$50 million were recognised as interest income. The APLNG MRCPS were fully bought back as at 30 June 2022.\n\n## Octopus Energy\n\n## Additional equity transactions\n\nOn 9 August 2022 an additional investment of \u00a394 million (A$163 million) was paid by the Group to Octopus Energy to restore its 20 per cent equity interest.\n\nIn January 2023 the Group invested a further \u00a35.6 million (A$10 million), following further investments by other shareholders, to maintain its 20 per cent equity interest.\n\n## Financial guarantee\n\nThe Group provided a financial guarantee to Octopus Energy's financiers and during the year, $6 million (2022: $9 million) was recognised within other income in respect of the financial guarantee income. The financial guarantee expired in March 2023.\n\n## Kraken technology platform milestone payment\n\nThe \u00a310 million (A$20 million) final milestone payment was paid in May 2023.",

Unbilled receivables represent estimated gas and electricity supplied to customers since their previous bill was issued. The carrying value of all receivables, including unbilled revenue, reflects the amount anticipated to be collected.\n\n## Key judgements and estimates\n\nRecoverability of trade receivables : Judgement is required in determining the level of provisioning for customer debts. Impairment allowances take into account the age of the debt, historic collection trends and expectations about future economic conditions.\n\nUnbilled revenue : Unbilled gas and electricity revenue is not collectable until customers' meters are read and invoices issued. Refer to note A2 for judgement applied in determining the amount of unbilled energy revenue to recognise.\n\n## Credit risk and collectability\n\nThe Group minimises the concentration of credit risk by undertaking transactions with a large number of customers from across a broad range of industries. Credit approval processes are in place for large customers and all customers are required to pay in accordance with agreed payment terms. Depending on the customer segment, settlement terms are generally 14 to 30 days from the date of the invoice. For some debtors, the Group may also obtain security in the form of deposits, guarantees, deeds of undertaking or letters of credit, which can be called upon if the counterparty defaults.\n\nDebtor collectability is assessed on an ongoing basis and any resulting impairment losses are recognised in the income statement. The Group applies the simplified approach to providing for trade receivable and unbilled revenue impairment, which requires the expected lifetime credit losses to be recognised when the receivable is initially recognised. To measure expected lifetime credit losses, trade receivables and unbilled revenue balances have been grouped based on shared credit risk characteristics and ageing profiles. A debtor balance is written off when recovery is assessed to be no longer possible.",

Refer to note F4.\n\nThe Group holds a number of exploration permits that are grouped into areas of interest according to geographical and geological attributes. Expenditure incurred in each area of interest is accounted for using the successful efforts method. Under this method, all general exploration and evaluation costs are expensed as incurred except the direct costs of acquiring the rights to explore, drilling exploratory wells and evaluating the results of drilling. These direct costs are capitalised as exploration and evaluation assets pending the determination of the success of the well. If a well does not result in a successful discovery, the previously capitalised costs are immediately expensed.\n\nThe carrying amounts of exploration and evaluation assets are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether any of the following indicators of impairment are present:\n\n- \u00b7 the right to explore has expired, or will expire in the near future, and is not expected to be renewed;\n- \u00b7 further exploration for and evaluation of resources in the specific area is not budgeted or planned for;\n- \u00b7 the Group has decided to discontinue activities in the area; or\n- \u00b7 there is sufficient data to indicate the carrying value is unlikely to be recovered in full from successful development or by sale.\n\nWhere an indicator of impairment exists, the asset's recoverable amount is estimated. If it is concluded that the carrying value of an exploration and evaluation asset is unlikely to be recovered by future exploitation or sale, an impairment is recognised in the income statement for the difference.\n\n## Key judgement\n\n## Recoverability of exploration and evaluation assets\n\nAssessment of the recoverability of capitalised exploration and evaluation expenditure requires certain estimates and assumptions to be made as to future events and circumstances, particularly in relation to whether economic quantities of reserves have been discovered. Such estimates and assumptions may change as new information becomes available. Additionally, future climate-related conditions, legislation and policies may impact whether reserve quantities are capable of economic extraction. The recoverability of these assets continues to be monitored by the Group. Such estimates and assumptions may change as new information becomes available.\n\nUpon approval of the commercial development of a project, the exploration and evaluation asset is classified as a development asset. Once production commences, development assets are transferred to PP&E.",

Cost includes the estimated future cost of required closure and rehabilitation.\n\nThe carrying amounts of assets are reviewed to determine if there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, the asset's recoverable amount is estimated and if required, an impairment is recognised in the income statement.\n\nDepreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis so as to write off the cost of each asset over its expected useful life. Leasehold improvements are amortised over the period of the relevant lease or estimated useful life, whichever is shorter. Land and capital work in progress are not depreciated.\n\nThe estimated useful lives used in the calculation of depreciation are shown below.\n\n- \u00b7 Buildings, including leasehold improvements 10 to 50 years\n- \u00b7 Plant and equipment 3 to 30 years",

ROU assets are initially valued at the corresponding lease liability amount adjusted for any payments already made, lease incentives received, or initial direct costs incurred when entering into the lease. Where the Group is required to restore the ROU asset at the end of the lease, the cost of restoration is also included in the value of the ROU asset.\n\nROU assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease term or the useful life of the ROU asset. The carrying amounts of ROU assets are reviewed to determine if there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, the asset's recoverable amount is estimated, and if required, an impairment is recognised in the income statement.\n\nRefer to note D2 for discussion of the recognition and measurement of associated lease liability balances.\n\n## Key judgements and estimates\n\nRecoverability of carrying values : Estimates of recoverable amounts are based on an asset's value-in-use or fair value less costs to sell, whichever is higher. The recoverable amount of these assets is sensitive to changes in key assumptions.\n\nEstimation of useful economic lives : A technical assessment of the operating life of an asset requires significant judgement. Useful lives are amended prospectively when a change in the operating life is determined. The estimated useful lives of our assets align with our climate change strategy commitments.\n\nEraring Power Station useful life : The useful life of Eraring remains unchanged at August 2025 for the purpose of accounting assessments presented within these financial statements. Prevailing market conditions will continue to be assessed which will help inform the final timing of closure of all four units at Eraring. Refer to the Strategy and climate change risks section in the Overview.\n\nRestoration provisions : An asset's carrying value includes the estimated future cost of required closure and rehabilitation activities. Refer to note C5 for the judgement related to restoration provisions.\n\nClimate change risks : Future climate-related conditions, legislation and policies may have an impact on these estimates and continues to be monitored.\n\nLease term : Where lease arrangements contain options to extend the term or terminate the contract, the Group assesses whether it is 'reasonably certain' that the option to extend or terminate will be exercised. Consideration is given to all facts and circumstances that create an economic incentive to extend or terminate the contract. Lease liabilities and ROU assets are measured using the reasonably certain contract term.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Also included within this balance are rehabilitation provisions for contamination at existing and legacy operating sites.\n- 2 All material contracts in which the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations exceed the economic benefits are deemed onerous and require a provision to be recognised upfront. This balance relates to an onerous contract provision of $62 million (US$41 million) (2022: $397 million (US$273 million)) for the LNG sales contract with ENN.\n- 3 The closing balance of other provisions primarily relates to costs for compliance with safety standard requirements relating to the Eraring ash dam wall, costs associated with the new Myuna Bay Recreation Centre facility, costs associated with the Eraring Power Station closure and a make good provision relating to existing property leases.\n\nRestoration provisions are initially recognised at the best estimate of the costs to be incurred in settling the obligation. Where restoration activities are expected to occur more than 12 months from the reporting period, the provision is discounted using a risk-free rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money. The unwinding of the discount is recognised in each period as interest expense.\n\nAt each reporting date, the restoration provision is remeasured in line with changes in discount rates, and changes to the timing or amount of costs to be incurred, based on current legal requirements and technology. Any changes in the estimated future costs associated with:\n\n- \u00b7 Restoration and dismantling are added to or deducted from the related asset; and\n- \u00b7 Environmental rehabilitation are expensed in the current period.\n\n## Key estimate\n\n## Restoration, rehabilitation and dismantling costs\n\nThe Group estimates the cost of future site restoration activities at the time of installation or construction of an asset, or when an obligation arises. Restoration often does not occur for many years and thus significant judgement is required as to the extent of work, cost and timing of future activities. Future social, regulatory and climate-related conditions and policies may have an impact on these estimates and will continue to be monitored.\n\nThe useful life of Eraring remains unchanged at August 2025 for the purpose of accounting assessments presented within these financial statements. Prevailing market conditions will continue to be assessed which will help inform the final timing of closure of all four units at Eraring.

The Energy Markets segment consists of the following materially distinct CGUs:\n\n- \u00b7 Retail CGU : incorporates Mass Market customers, Commercial & Industrial customers and the Wholesale & Trading businesses for electricity and natural gas commodities. The Wholesale & Trading business includes various electricity power purchase agreements and major wholesale gas supply contracts.\n- \u00b7 Generation CGU : incorporates cash flows from Origin's power stations.\n- \u00b7 LPG CGU : supplies and distributes LPG to residential and business locations across Australia and the Pacific.\n\nThe carrying amounts of the CGUs are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. Where an indicator of impairment exists, or where goodwill is present, a formal estimate of the recoverable amount is made.\n\nOnly the Retail CGU contains a material goodwill balance and an impairment assessment of the recoverable amount was performed in the current and prior year.",

Information is also presented about how the Group manages capital, and the various financial risks to which the Group is exposed through its operating and financing activities.\n\n## D1 Capital management\n\nThe Group's objective when managing capital is to make disciplined capital allocation decisions between investment in growth, distributions to shareholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure while maintaining access to capital. Management believes that a strong investment-grade credit rating (Baa2) and an appropriate level of net debt are required to meet these objectives. The Group's current credit rating is Baa2 (stable outlook) from Moody's.\n\nKey factors considered in determining the Group's capital structure and funding strategy at any point in time include expected operating cash flows, capital expenditure plans, the maturity profile of existing debt facilities, the dividend policy, and the ability to access funding from banks, capital markets and other sources.\n\nThe Group monitors its capital requirements through a number of metrics including the gearing ratio (target range of approximately 20 to 30 per cent) and an adjusted net debt to adjusted underlying EBITDA ratio (target range of 2.0x to 3.0x). These targets are consistent with attaining a strong investment-grade rating. Underlying EBITDA is a non-statutory (non-IFRS) measure.\n\nThe gearing ratio is calculated as adjusted net debt divided by adjusted net debt plus total equity. Net debt, which excludes cash held by Origin to fund APLNG-related operations, is adjusted to take into account the effect of FX hedging transactions on the Group's foreign currency debt obligations. The adjusted net debt to adjusted underlying EBITDA ratio is calculated as adjusted net debt divided by adjusted underlying EBITDA (Origin's underlying EBITDA less Origin's share of APLNG underlying EBITDA and Origin's share of Octopus Energy underlying EBITDA plus net cash flow from APLNG) over the relevant rolling 12-month period.\n\nThe Group monitors its current and future funding requirements for at least the next five years and regularly assesses a range of funding alternatives to meet these requirements in advance of when the funds are required.\n\n|                                                                | 2023 $m   | 2022 $m   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Borrowings                                                     | 2,713     | 2,855     |\n| Lease liabilities                                              | 545       | 535       |\n| Total interest-bearing liabilities                             | 3,258     | 3,390     |\n| Less: Cash and cash equivalents excluding APLNG-related cash 1 | (370)     | (572)     |\n| Net debt                                                       | 2,888     | 2,818     |\n| Fair value adjustments on FX hedging transactions              | (11)      | 20        |\n| Adjusted net debt                                              | 2,877     | 2,838     |\n| Total equity                                                   | 8,911     | 10,022    |\n| Total capital                                                  | 11,788    | 12,860    |\n| Gearing ratio                                                  | 24%       | 22%       |\n| Ratio of adjusted net debt to adjusted underlying EBITDA       | 1.2x      | 1.9x      |\n\n- 1 This balance excludes $93 million (2022: $48 million) of cash held by Origin, as upstream operator, to fund APLNG-related operations.\n\n## Bank debt facility repayment\n\nOn 19 August 2022 Origin made an early repayment of a US$20 million syndicated bank facility tranche.\n\n## Debt maturity\n\nOn 4 April 2023 Origin repaid the \u20ac150 million ten-year note issued under the Euro Medium Term Note program. The notes had been swapped to A$186 million.",

After that date, the liability is amortised to face value at maturity using an effective interest rate method.\n\nLease liabilities are initially measured at the present value of future lease payments discounted at the Group's incremental borrowing rate. Where a lease includes termination and/or extension options, the impact of these options on the amount of future payments is included where exercise of such options is considered reasonably certain to occur. Interest expense is charged on outstanding lease liabilities that reduce over time as periodic payments are made.\n\nThe lease liability is remeasured when certain events occur, including changes in the lease term or changes in future lease payments such as those resulting from inflation-linked indexation or market rate rent reviews. On remeasurement of lease liabilities, a corresponding adjustment is made to the ROU asset.\n\nThe contractual maturity of lease liabilities is disclosed within the liquidity table in note D4.\n\nThe contractual maturities of non-current borrowings are as set out below.\n\n|                              | 2023 $m   | 2022 $m   |\n|------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| One to two years             | -         | 123       |\n| Two to five years            | 814       | 508       |\n| Over five years              | 1,771     | 1,967     |\n| Total non-current borrowings | 2,585     | 2,598     |\n\nSome of the Group's borrowings are subject to terms that allow the lender to call on the debt in the event of a breach of covenants.

Shares are accounted for at a weighted average cost.\n\n## D4 Financial risk management\n\n## Overview\n\nThe Group's day-to-day operations, new investment opportunities and funding activities introduce financial risks, which are actively managed by the Board Risk Committee.

The table below summarises these risks by nature of exposure and provides information about the risk mitigation strategies being applied.\n\n| Nature           | Sources of financial exposure                                                                                                                                       | Risk management strategy                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Commodity price  | Future commercial transactions and recognised assets and  liabilities exposed to changes in electricity, oil, gas, coal or  environmental scheme certificate prices | Due to vertical integration, a significant portion of the  Group's spot electricity purchases from the NEM are  naturally hedged by generation sales into the NEM at  spot prices. The Group manages its remaining exposure  to commodity price fluctuations within Board-approved  limits using a mix of commercial contracts (such as  fixed-price purchase contracts) and derivative instruments  (described below).                                                            |\n| Foreign exchange | Foreign-denominated borrowings and investments and future  foreign currency denominated commercial transactions                                                     | The Group limits its exposure to changes in foreign  exchange rates through forward foreign exchange  contracts and cross-currency interest rate swaps. In certain  circumstances, borrowings are left in a foreign currency, or  swapped from one foreign currency to another, to hedge  expected future business cash flows in that currency.  Significant foreign-denominated transactions undertaken  in the normal course of operations are managed on a  case-by-case basis. |\n| Interest rate    | Variable-rate borrowings (cash flow risk) and fixed-rate borrowings  (fair value risk)                                                                              | Interest rate exposures are kept within an acceptable range  as determined by the Board. Risk limits are managed  through a combination of fixed-rate and fixed-to-floating  interest rate swaps.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n\n## Derivatives to manage market risks\n\nDerivative instruments are contracts with values that are derived from an underlying price index (or other variable) that require little or no initial net investment, and that are settled at a future date.\n\nThe Group uses the following types of derivative instruments to mitigate market risk.\n\n| Forwards                         | A contract documenting the underlying reference rate (such as benchmark price or exchange rate) to be paid or received on  a notional principal obligation at a future date.                                                                                               |\n|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Futures                          | An exchange-traded contract to buy or sell an asset for an agreed price at a future date. Futures are net-settled in cash without  physical delivery of the underlying asset.                                                                                              |\n| Swaps                            | A contract in which two parties exchange a series of cash flows for another (such as fixed-for-floating interest rate).                                                                                                                                                    |\n| Options                          | A contract in which the buyer has the right, but not the obligation, to buy (a call option) or sell (a put option) an instrument at  a fixed price in the future. The seller has the corresponding obligation to fulfil the transaction if the buyer exercises the option. |\n| Structured  electricity products | A non-standardised contract, generally with an energy market participant, to acquire long-term capacity. These contracts  typically contain features similar to swaps and call options.                                                                                    |\n\nDerivatives are carried on the balance sheet at fair value. Movements in the price of the underlying variables, which cause the value of the contract to fluctuate, are reflected in the fair value of the derivative.\n\nThe method of recognising changes in fair value depends on whether the derivative is designated in an 'accounting' hedge relationship. Derivatives not designated as accounting hedges are referred to as 'economic' hedges.\n\nFair value gains and losses attributable to economic hedges are recognised in the income statement and resulted in a $270 million gain (2022: $1,153 million gain) for the year. Fair value gains and losses attributable to accounting hedges are discussed in the Hedge Accounting section.\n\n<!-- image -->",

As such, they are not represented in the summary information below.\n\n| 2023                                      | FX and interest          | Electricity   | Crude oil & gas                                           |                                      | Propane          |\n|-------------------------------------------|--------------------------|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|------------------|\n| Nominal hedge volumes                     | EUR 600m                 | 13.1 TWh      | 1,406k barrels  (crude oil); 11.9 tBtu (gas)              |                                      | 104k mt          |\n| Hedge rates                               | AUD/EUR 0.62; Fixed 3.2% | $22-$300/MWh  | US$53-US$94/bbl  (ICE Brent); US$6.5-US$37.2/ MMBtu (JKM) |                                      | US$490-US$620/mt |\n| Timing of cash flows - up to              | Sep 2029                 | Dec 2026      | Oct 2024 (ICE Brent); Dec 2025 (JKM)                      | Oct 2024 (ICE Brent); Dec 2025 (JKM) | Dec 2026         |\n| Carrying amounts - $m                     | FX and interest          | Electricity   | Crude oil & gas                                           | Propane                              | Total            |\n| Hedging instrument - assets 1             | -                        | 564           | 149                                                       | -                                    | 713              |\n| Hedging instrument - liabilities 1        | (31)                     | (198)         | (59)                                                      | (10)                                 | (298)            |\n| Hedge reserve 2                           | 45                       | (366)         | (99)                                                      | 10                                   | (410)            |\n| Fair value increase/(decrease) - $m       |                          |               |                                                           |                                      |                  |\n| Hedging instrument                        | (18)                     | (1,918)       | (656)                                                     | (19)                                 | (2,611)          |\n| Hedged item                               | 18                       | 1,918         | 645                                                       | 19                                   | 2,600            |\n| Hedge ineffectiveness 3                   | -                        | -             | (11)                                                      | -                                    | (11)             |\n| Reconciliation of hedge reserve - $m      |                          |               |                                                           |                                      |                  |\n| Effective portion of hedge gains/(losses) | (19)                     | (215)         | (186)                                                     | (13)                                 | (433)            |\n| Transfer of deferred losses/(gains) to:   |                          |               |                                                           |                                      |                  |\n| - Cost of sales                           | -                        | (1,704)       | (484)                                                     | (6)                                  | (2,194)          |\n| - Finance costs                           | (30)                     | -             | -                                                         | -                                    | (30)             |\n| Tax on above items                        | 15                       | 575           | 201                                                       | 6                                    | 797              |\n| Change in hedge reserve (post-tax)        | (34)                     | (1,344)       | (469)                                                     | (13)                                 | (1,860)          |\n\n- 1 Hedging instruments are included in the derivatives balance on the statement of financial position.\n- 2 No hedges have been discontinued or de-designated in the current year.\n- 3 Hedge ineffectiveness is recognised within expenses in the income statement as a change in fair value of derivatives.\n\n<!-- image -->",

These instruments are included in level 1.\n- \u00b7 Level 2 : The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market (such as over-the-counter derivatives) is determined using valuation techniques that maximise the use of observable market data. If all significant inputs required to fair value an instrument are observable, either directly (as prices) or indirectly (derived from prices), the instrument is included in level 2.\n- \u00b7 Level 3 : If one or more of the significant inputs required to fair value an instrument is not based on observable market data, the instrument is included in level 3.\n\n| 2023                                        | Note   | Level 1 $m   | Level 2 $m   | Level 3 $m   | Total $m   |\n|---------------------------------------------|--------|--------------|--------------|--------------|------------|\n| Derivative financial assets                 | D4     | 1,044        | 1,310        | 322          | 2,676      |\n| Other financial assets at fair value        | C6     | 478          | 69           | 170          | 717        |\n| Financial assets carried at fair value      |        | 1,522        | 1,379        | 492          | 3,393      |\n| Derivative financial liabilities            | D4     | (592)        | (883)        | (600)        | (2,075)    |\n| Other financial liabilities at fair value   | C6     | (369)        | -            | -            | (369)      |\n| Financial liabilities carried at fair value |        | (961)        | (883)        | (600)        | (2,444)    |\n| 2022                                        |        | Level 1 $m   | Level 2 $m   | Level 3 $m   | Total $m   |\n| Derivative financial assets                 | D4     | 1,917        | 3,382        | 950          | 6,249      |\n| Other financial assets at fair value        | C6     | 623          | 73           | 74           | 770        |\n| Financial assets carried at fair value      |        | 2,540        | 3,455        | 1,024        | 7,019      |\n| Derivative financial liabilities            | D4     | (471)        | (2,294)      | (569)        | (3,334)    |\n| Other financial liabilities at fair value   | C6     | (417)        | -            | -            | (417)      |\n| Financial liabilities carried at fair value |        | (888)        | (2,294)      | (569)        | (3,751)    |\n\nThe following table shows a reconciliation of movements in the fair value of level 3 instruments during the year.\n\n|                                                         | $m    |\n|---------------------------------------------------------|-------|\n| Balance as at 1 July 2022                               | 455   |\n| New instruments recognised in the year                  | 80    |\n| Net cash settlements paid/(received)                    | (258) |\n| Gains/(losses) recognised in other comprehensive income | 12    |\n| Gains/(losses) recognised in profit or loss             |       |\n| Change in fair value                                    | (655) |\n| Cost of sales                                           | 258   |\n| Balance as at 30 June 2023                              | (108) |",

To the maximum extent possible, valuations are based on assumptions that are supported by independent and observable market data. For instruments that settle more than 12 months from the reporting date, cash flows are discounted at the applicable market yield, adjusted to reflect the credit risk of the specific counterparty.\n\n| Instrument                                                                        | Fair value methodology                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Financial instruments traded in  active markets                                   | Quoted market prices at reporting date.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n| Interest rate swaps and CCIRS                                                     | Present value of expected future cash flows based on observable yield curves and forward exchange rates at  reporting date.                                                                                                                                                    |\n| Forward foreign  exchange contracts                                               | Present value of future cash flows based on observable forward exchange rates at reporting date.                                                                                                                                                                               |\n| Electricity, oil and other commodity  derivatives (not traded in  active markets) | Present value of expected future cash flows based on observable forward commodity price curves (where  available).

The head entity within the tax-consolidated group is Origin Energy Limited. Tax funding arrangement amounts are recognised as inter-entity amounts.\n\nIncome tax expense is made up of current tax expense and deferred tax expense. Current tax expense represents the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using current tax rates and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years. Deferred tax expense reflects the temporary differences between the accounting carrying amount of an asset or liability in the statement of financial position and its tax base.",

Uncertainty arises due to the possibility that changes in tax law or other future circumstances can impact the tax balances recognised in the financial statements. Ultimate outcomes may vary.\n\nDeferred taxes : The recognition of deferred tax balances requires judgement as to whether it is probable such balances will be utilised and/or reversed in the foreseeable future and there will be sufficient future taxable profits against which the benefits can be utilised.\n\nA deferred tax liability is recognised for taxable temporary differences associated with investments in joint ventures unless the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. The deferred tax liability in respect of the investment in APLNG represents carried forward equity accounted earnings that are expected to be distributed to Origin via dividends from APLNG in the foreseeable future. In determining the forecast distributions from APLNG, the Group's assessment of future cash flows considers a range of macroeconomic and project assumptions, including oil and LNG prices, AUD/USD exchange rates, discount rates and costs over the asset's life.\n\nAt 30 June 2023, the Group has recognised a deferred tax liability of $528 million. The remaining unbooked balance is not expected to reverse in the foreseeable future through the payment of future dividends, through sale or through a capital return. The unrecognised portion is disclosed in note E2.\n\n## Income tax expense recognised in other comprehensive income\n\n|                                                        | 2023    | 2023   | 2023    | 2022   | 2022    | 2022   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------|---------|--------|---------|--------|---------|--------|\n| $m                                                     | Gross   | Tax    | Net     | Gross  | Tax     | Net    |\n| Actuarial gain on defined benefit  superannuation plan | -       | -      | -       | 1      | -       | 1      |\n| Investment valuation changes                           | 12      | (3)    | 9       | 4      | (1)     | 3      |\n| Foreign currency translation reserve:                  |         |        |         |        |         |        |\n| Reclassified to income statement                       | (62)    | -      | (62)    | (103)  | -       | (103)  |\n| Translation of foreign operations                      | 282     | 8      | 290     | 584    | 14      | 598    |\n| Cash flow hedges:                                      |         |        |         |        |         |        |\n| Reclassified to income statement                       | (2,224) | 667    | (1,557) | (443)  | 133     | (310)  |\n| Effective portion of change in fair value              | (433)   | 130    | (303)   | 3,407  | (1,022) | 2,385  |\n| Other comprehensive income for the year                | (2,425) | 802    | (1,623) | 3,450  | (876)   | 2,574  |\n\n## E2 Deferred tax\n\nDeferred tax balances arise when there are temporary differences between accounting carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities, other than where:\n\n- \u00b7 the difference arises from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss;\n- \u00b7 temporary differences relate to investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests in joint arrangements, to the extent the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future; and\n- \u00b7 temporary differences arise on initial recognition of goodwill.\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the year when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.\n\nA deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised. Deferred tax assets are reduced if it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.\n\n<!-- image -->",

This includes the Group's wholly-owned entities in Vanuatu, American Samoa, Samoa and Cook Islands, and controlled entities in Fiji, Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands. There are a number of conditions and regulatory approvals required before the sale can be completed and the assets and liabilities relating to the sale have been classified as held for sale as at 30 June 2023.\n\n## Canning Basin\n\nOn 10 February 2023 Origin executed an agreement with Buru Energy Limited (Buru) to exit from its participating interests in the seven Exploration Permits in the Canning Basin, the respective Joint Operating Agreements and the Farm-in Agreements. The terms of the sale provide for Origin to provide Buru with up to $4 million to fund a seismic survey and for Buru to provide Origin with future reimbursement payments of up to $34 million, conditional on the achievement of key development and production milestones. Settlement of the transaction remains subject to regulatory approvals.\n\n|                                   | 30 June 2023   | 30 June 2023     |\n|-----------------------------------|----------------|------------------|\n|                                   | LPG Pacific $m | Canning Basin $m |\n| Current assets                    |                |                  |\n| Cash and cash equivalents         | 20             | -                |\n| Trade and other receivables       | 12             | -                |\n| Inventories                       | 13             | -                |\n| Other assets                      | 1              | -                |\n| Total current assets              | 46             | -                |\n| Non-current assets                |                |                  |\n| PP&E                              | 44             | -                |\n| Exploration and evaluation assets | -              | 8                |\n| Intangible assets                 | 2              | -                |\n| Deferred tax assets               | 1              | -                |\n| Total non-current assets          | 47             | 8                |\n| Total assets                      | 93             | 8                |\n| Current liabilities               |                |                  |\n| Trade and other payables          | 5              | -                |\n| Interest-bearing liabilities      | 3              | -                |\n| Employee benefits                 | 1              | -                |\n| Total current liabilities         | 9              | -                |\n| Non-current liabilities           |                |                  |\n| Interest-bearing liabilities      | 3              | -                |\n| Deferred tax liabilities          | 2              | -                |\n| Provisions                        | -              | 1                |\n| Total non-current liabilities     | 5              | 1                |\n| Total liabilities                 | 14             | 1                |\n| Net assets                        | 79             | 7                |\n| Carrying amount of NCI            | 20             | -                |\n\n## Disposals\n\n## Beetaloo\n\nOn 19 September 2022 the Group entered into a Share Sale Agreement with Tamboran (B1) Pty Ltd for the sale of 100% of the shares of Origin Energy B2 Pty Ltd, which holds a 77.5% interest in three exploration permits in the Beetaloo Basin. Completion of the transaction occurred on 9 November 2022 for upfront consideration of $60 million and a royalty based on wellhead revenues produced from the three Beetaloo permits. This resulted in a pre-tax loss on disposal of $106 million.\n\n## Origin Energy Hydro Bermuda Pty Limited\n\nOn 10 January 2023 Origin Energy Hydro Bermuda Pty Limited was wound up. A net gain on disposal of $62 million was recycled to the income statement from the foreign currency translation reserve on wind up.",

In some circumstances, the Group may incur more than its proportionate share of such liabilities but will have the right to recover the excess liability from the other joint arrangement participants.\n\nIn October 2018, Origin and the other APLNG shareholders agreed to indemnify one of APLNG's long-term LNG customers (following that customer's election to defer delivery of 30 cargoes over six years (2019-24)) should APLNG fail to supply make-up cargoes to that customer prior to the expiry of the LNG supply contract. The customer will pay APLNG for the deferred cargoes and APLNG expects to resell the gas to other customers and deliver the deferred cargoes to the long-term LNG customer between 2025 and the end of the LNG supply contract. The indemnity was provided severally in accordance with each shareholder's proportionate shareholding in APLNG. At the inception of the agreement, any obligation or liability on the part of the shareholders will only be confirmed by the occurrence or non-occurrence of future events.\n\n## Legal and regulatory\n\nCertain entities within the Group (and joint venture entities, such as APLNG) are subject to various lawsuits and claims as well as audits and reviews by government, regulatory bodies or other joint venture partners. In most instances, it is not possible to reasonably predict the outcome of these matters or their impact on the Group and accordingly is not probable that future payments will be made. Where outcomes can be reasonably predicted, provisions are recorded.\n\nA number of sites owned/operated (or previously owned/operated) by the Group have been identified as potentially contaminated. For sites where it is likely that a present obligation exists, and it is probable that an outflow of resource will be required to settle the obligation, such costs have been expensed or provided for.\n\nWarranties and indemnities have also been given and/or received by entities in the Group in relation to environmental liabilities for certain properties divested and/or acquired.\n\n## Capital expenditure\n\nAs part of the acquisition of Browse Basin exploration permits in 2015, the Group agreed to pay cash consideration of US$75 million contingent upon a project Final Investment Decision (FID), and US$75 million contingent upon first production. The Group will pay further contingent consideration of up to US$50 million upon first production if 2P reserves, at the time of the FID, reach certain thresholds. These obligations have not been provided for at the reporting date as they are possible obligations that are dependent upon uncertain future events not wholly within the Group's control.\n\n## Bank guarantees\n\nThere are no contingent liabilities arising from bank guarantees held by the Group that are required to be disclosed as at the reporting date, as these have either been provided for, or an outflow of economic benefits is considered remote.\n\nThe Group's share of guarantees for certain contractual commitments of its joint ventures is shown at note G2.",

Participation in the plan is at the Board's discretion and no individual has a contractual right to participate or to receive any guaranteed benefits. Equity incentives granted prior to FY2018 were offered in the form of Options and/or Share Rights. From FY2019 onwards, equity incentives are granted in the form of Share Rights and/or Restricted Shares (RSs). Only RSs carry dividend and voting entitlements. To the extent that Share Rights ultimately vest, a dividend equivalent mechanism operates.\n\n## (i) Short Term Incentive\n\nShort Term Incentive (STI) includes the award of RSs, which are subject to trading restrictions for a set period of time (generally up to two years), after which they become unrestricted, provided that the employee remains employed with satisfactory performance. Once unrestricted, the shares are transferred into the employee's name at no cost. The face value of RSs measured at grant date is recognised as an employee expense over the related service period. RSs are forfeited if the service and performance conditions are not met. 3\n\n## (ii) Long Term Incentive\n\nThe Long Term Incentive (LTI) awards include the award of Share Rights, which vest subject to performance conditions. Generally, half of each LTI award is made in the form of Performance Share Rights (PSRs) and is subject to a market hurdle, namely Origin's Total Shareholder Return (TSR) relative to a Reference Group of ASX-listed companies, as identified in the 2023 Remuneration Report. The remaining half of each LTI award is made in the form of Restricted Share Rights (RSRs), where vesting is subject to Board assessment with reference to a suite of underpinning conditions, as set out in the 2023 Remuneration Report.\n\nThe number of awards that may vest are considered separately for PSRs and RSRs. For the PSR awards, which are subject to the relative TSR hurdle, vesting only occurs if Origin's TSR over the performance period ranks higher than the 50th percentile of the Reference Group. Half of the PSRs vest if that condition is satisfied. All the PSRs vest if Origin ranks at or above the 75th percentile of the Reference Group. Straight-line pro-rata vesting applies in between these two points. The PSR grants made in FY2023 have a performance period of three years. Vesting is into RSs with a trading restriction for a further two years (total deferral five years). For the RSR awards, the Board will determine the vesting outcome shortly before each of three progressive vesting dates at years three, four and five by reference to a broad range of performance indicators. Vesting is into RSs which all have trading restrictions until the end of the fifth year.\n\nPrior to FY2021, the LTI awards include the award of PSRs, such that half of the award is subject to the TSR hurdle, and the remaining half of each LTI award is subject to an internal hurdle, namely Return on Capital Employed (ROCE), as set out in the relevant remuneration report.\n\nFor awards granted in FY2020 that are subject to the ROCE hurdle, half of the ROCE tranche is allocated to Energy Markets and the other half to Integrated Gas. Each tranche is tested separately and vest separately. Vesting for each tranche only occurs if the average actual annual ROCE outcomes over the performance period for the relevant business meets or exceeds the average of the annual ROCE targets, which are reflective of delivering WACC for the relevant business. Half of the relevant PSRs will vest if the ROCE target is met. All the relevant PSRs vest if the ROCE target is exceeded by two percentage points or more. Straight-line pro-rata vesting applies in between. The last tranche of these PSRs that were subject to the ROCE hurdle, vested in FY2023. The LTI awards granted after FY2020 are no longer subject to the ROCE hurdle.\n\nVested share rights are automatically exercised upon vesting, and there is no exercise price. Upon exercise, a vested award is converted into one fully paid ordinary share that is subject to a post-vesting holding lock for a set period (generally up to two years) and carries voting and dividend entitlements.",

In exceptional circumstances 4 , unvested Share Rights may be held 'on foot' subject to the specified performance hurdles and other plan conditions being met, or dealt with in an appropriate manner determined by the Board.\n\nFor PSRs subject to the relative TSR condition, fair value is measured at grant date using a Monte Carlo simulation model that takes into account the exercise price, share price at grant date, price volatility, dividend yield, risk-free interest rate for the term of the security, and the likelihood of meeting the TSR market condition.\n\nThe expected volatility reflects the assumption that the historical volatility over a period similar to the life of the options is indicative of future trends, which may not necessarily be the actual outcome. The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of awards that vest except where due to non-achievement of the TSR market condition. Set out below are the inputs used to determine the fair value of the PSRs granted during the year.\n\nFor RSRs subject to the underpinning conditions, the initial fair value at grant date is the market value of an Origin share, and the recognised expense is trued up at each reporting period to the expected outcome as assessed at that time.\n\nSet out below is a summary of RSRs and PSRs issued during the financial year.\n\n|                                   | RSRs        | RSRs        | PSRs        | PSRs        |\n|-----------------------------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|\n| Grant date                        | 05 Sep 2022 | 19 Oct 2022 | 05 Sep 2022 | 19 Oct 2022 |\n| Grant date share price            | $6.13       | $5.64       | $6.13       | $5.64       |\n| Exercise price                    | Nil         | Nil         | Nil         | Nil         |\n| Volatility                        | -           | -           | 38%         | 38%         |\n| Risk-free rate 1                  | -           | -           | 3.29%       | 3.48%       |\n| Grant date fair value (per award) | $6.13       | $5.64       | $3.63       | $3.17       |\n\n## Equity Incentive Plan awards outstanding\n\nSet out below is a summary of awards outstanding at the beginning and end of the financial year.\n\n|                                 | Options   | Weighted average exercise price   | PSRs      | RSRs      | DSRs   | RSs       |\n|---------------------------------|-----------|-----------------------------------|-----------|-----------|--------|-----------|\n| Outstanding at 1 July 2022      | 1,222,882 | $7.37                             | 4,332,463 | 2,258,298 | -      | 8,001,126 |\n| Granted                         | -         | -                                 | 1,201,418 | 1,213,686 | -      | 3,565,032 |\n| Exercised/released              | -         | -                                 | 516,996   | -         | -      | 3,890,357 |\n| Forfeited                       | 1,222,882 | -                                 | 1,627,291 | 42,681    | -      | 252,808   |\n| Outstanding as at  30 June 2023 | -         | -                                 | 3,389,594 | 3,429,303 | -      | 7,422,993 |\n| Exercisable as at 30 June 2023  | -         | -                                 | -         | -         | -      | -         |\n| Outstanding at 1 July 2021      | 3,105,221 | $6.32                             | 5,670,304 | 995,169   | 45,556 | 6,695,155 |\n| Granted                         | -         | -                                 | 1,296,535 | 1,311,963 | -      | 4,929,061 |\n| Exercised/released              | -         | -                                 | 397,663   | -         | 45,556 | 3,156,022 |\n| Forfeited                       | 1,882,339 | -                                 | 2,236,713 | 48,834    | -      | 467,068   |\n| Outstanding as at  30 June 2022 | 1,222,882 | $7.37                             | 4,332,463 | 2,258,298 | -      | 8,001,126 |\n| Exercisable as at 30 June 2022  | -         | -                                 | -         | -         | -      | -         |\n\nThe weighted average share price during 2023 was $7.34 (2022: $5.45).

As a result of entering into the binding Scheme Implementation Deed with the Consortium, the operation of the ESP has been suspended from 31 March 2023 and no awards under the ESP are expected to be made during FY2024.\n\nUnder the GESP, all employees of the Company who are based in Australia and have been continuously employed as at 1 March of the performance year, are granted up to $1,000 of fully paid Origin shares conditional on Board approval. The shares are granted for no consideration. Shares awarded under the GESP are purchased on market, registered in the name of the employee, and are restricted for three years, or until cessation of employment, whichever occurs first.\n\nUnder the MSP, all eligible employees may elect to purchase shares via a salary sacrifice arrangement, which commences on 1 October of the performance year. The shares under this plan are allotted quarterly and are subject to a trading restriction for a set period (generally two years) or until cessation of employment. The Company matches the purchased shares on a one-for-two basis with allocation of additional Matching Rights (MRs) which vest at the same time as the restriction is lifted for the purchased shares. Vesting of MRs is conditional on the employee remaining in continuous employment at that time. MRs are forfeited if the service conditions are not met. 5\n\nDetails of the shares awarded under the GESP during the year are set out below.

In general, under such agreements the amounts owed by each counterparty on a single day in respect of all transactions outstanding in the same currency are aggregated into a net amount payable by one party to the other.\n\nFinancial assets and liabilities are offset, and the net amount reported in the statement of financial position, where the Group has a legally enforceable right to offset recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. The Group has also entered into arrangements that do not meet the criteria for offsetting, but still allow for the related amounts to be offset in certain circumstances, such as a loan default or the termination of a contract.\n\nThe following table presents the recognised financial instruments that are offset, or subject to master netting arrangements but not offset, as at the reporting date. The net amount column shows the impact on the Group's statement of financial position if all set-off rights were exercised.\n\n|                        | Gross amount $m   | Amount offset in  the statement of  financial  position $m   | Amount in the statement  of financial  position $m   | Related amount not offset $m   | Net amount $m   |\n|------------------------|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|-----------------|\n| 2023                   |                   |                                                              |                                                      |                                |                 |\n| Derivative assets      | 4,109             | (1,433)                                                      | 2,676                                                | (1,041)                        | 1,635           |\n| Derivative liabilities | (3,508)           | 1,433                                                        | (2,075)                                              | 1,041                          | (1,034)         |\n| 2022                   |                   |                                                              |                                                      |                                |                 |\n| Derivative assets      | 9,855             | (3,606)                                                      | 6,249                                                | (2,070)                        | 4,179           |\n| Derivative liabilities | (6,940)           | 3,606                                                        | (3,334)                                              | 2,070                          | (1,264)         |\n\n## G9 Deed of Cross Guarantee\n\nThe parent entity has entered into a Deed of Cross Guarantee through which the Group guarantees the debts of certain controlled entities in the event that one of those entities is wound up.

Giving a true and fair view of the consolidated financial position of the Group as at 30 June 2023 and of its consolidated financial performance for the year ended on that date; and\n- b. Complying with Australian Accounting Standards and the Corporations Regulations 2001 .\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with Australian Auditing Standards. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor ' s responsibilities for the audit of the financial report section of our report. We are independent of the Group in accordance with the auditor independence requirements of the Corporations Act 2001 and the ethical requirements of the Accounting Professional and Ethical Standards Board ' s APES 110 Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (including Independence Standards) (the Code) that are relevant to our audit of the financial report in Australia. We have also fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the Code.\n\nWe believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\n## Key Audit Matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial report of the current year. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial report as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, but we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. For each matter below, our description of how our audit addressed the matter is provided in that context.\n\nWe have fulfilled the responsibilities described in the Auditor ' s responsibilities for the audit of the financial report section of our report, including in relation to these matters. Accordingly, our audit included the performance of procedures designed to respond to our assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial report. The results of our audit procedures, including the procedures performed to address the matters below, provide the basis for our audit opinion on the accompanying financial report.\n\nA member firm of Ernst & Young Global Limited Liability limited by a scheme approved under Professional Standards Legislation",

Where no goodwill is present, the Group must assess for indicators of impairment and impairment reversal each reporting period. The Group assesses the recoverable amount of each CGU using a discounted cash flow forecast to determine value in use. No impairment loss or reversal of impairment across any of the Energy Market CGUs was recognised during the year.\n\nThe carrying value of the Energy Markets Group of CGUs is significant at 30 June 2023. As disclosed in Note C7, assumptions used in the forecasting of cash flows require significant judgment. In particular the forecasting of long-term energy and commodity price assumptions is subjective and complex in nature.\n\nAs a result of the significance of the carrying value and inherent judgment and complexity in the cash flow forecasts we considered the recoverability of the carrying value of the Energy Markets group of CGUs and the related disclosures in the financial report to be significant to our audit.\n\nOur audit procedures included the following:\n\n- \u00b7 Considered whether indicators of impairment or impairment reversal were present for each of the three CGUs within the Energy Markets Group of CGUs.\n- \u00b7 Assessed whether the methodology applied by the Group in testing the recoverable amount of each CGU met the requirements of Australian Accounting Standards.\n- \u00b7 A ssessed the basis for the determination of the Group's CGUs based on our understanding of the nature of the Group's business, the interdependence of cash flows, and the economic environment in which it operates.\n- \u00b7 Tested the mathematical accuracy of the discounted cash flow models.\n- \u00b7 Assessed the cash flow forecasts with reference to historical budgeting accuracy and current trading performance, historical growth rates, historical operating results, market data and forecasts, ratio analysis, and discussions with management and senior executives.\n- \u00b7 Where long term supply or sales contracts are in place, agreed the forecast revenue and costs to the contract terms and rates.\n- \u00b7 For the Generation CGU within the Energy Markets Group of CGUs, compared the useful lives of assets assumed in the impairment model to the Australian Energy Market Operator (' AEMO ') closure dates.\n- \u00b7 Involved our energy market modelling specialists to assess the conclusions reached by the Group's internal specialists in respect of forecast energy prices, forecast generation volumes, forecast capacity prices and marginal loss factors.\n- \u00b7 Involved our valuation specialists to:\n- o Assess the discount rates and terminal growth rates with reference to publicly available information on comparable companies in the industry and markets in which the Group operates; and\n- o Perform sensitivity analyses and evaluate the impact of reasonably possible changes in assumptions on the recoverable amount.\n- \u00b7 Cross checked the Group's net assets to other available information including market capitalisation and the Binding Scheme Implementation Deed signed on 27 March 2023.\n- \u00b7 Considered the potential impacts of climate risk on the recoverable amount by analysing the forecast energy price assumptions applied by management, asset useful lives and the possible changes to commodity prices resulting from the transition to a low carbon future.\n- \u00b7 Evaluated the adequacy of the related disclosure in the financial report.\n\n<!-- image -->",

No impairment or impairment reversal was recorded.\n\nAs disclosed in Note B2.2, the carrying amount of the Group's equity accounted investment in APLNG is reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indicators of impairment or impairment reversal. Where an indicator of impairment or impairment reversal exists, a formal estimate of the recoverable amount is made.\n\nOil price is a significant assumption used in this assessment and is inherently subjective. Changes in this assumption can lead to significant changes in the recoverable amount.\n\nDue to the significance of this investment relative to total assets and the inherent complexity in forecasting  commodity  prices  and  future  market outlooks,  we  considered  the  carrying  value  of  this investment to be a key audit matter.\n\nIn fulfilling our responsibilities as Group auditor, we considered the work performed by the EY Component Auditor responsible for auditing APLNG, which includes auditing the carrying value of APLNG's assets at the Joint Venture level .  These oversight procedures included:\n\n- \u00b7 Sending instructions to the EY Component Auditor detailing the scope to be covered for the purposes of our audit of the Group.  This included the risk associated with impairment or impairment reversal.\n- \u00b7 The Component Auditor confirmed compliance with the instructions provided and reported the results of their procedures to us.\n- \u00b7 To ensure sufficient oversight, we, as the Group audit team:\n- o Held frequent meetings with the Component Auditor to discuss the outcome and extent of their procedures.\n- o Reviewed underlying working papers and documentation of the Component Auditor for selected areas of audit focus.\n\nIn addition, we undertook the following additional procedures with the assistance of our valuations specialists:\n\n- \u00b7 Considered whether information existed that was contrary to the EY Component auditor's conclusion in respect of the existence of impairment or impairment reversal for APLNG at 30 June 2023 and may represent objective evidence of a significant or prolonged change in value of the investment, including:\n- o Considered changes to market conditions during the period including changes and volatility in key macroeconomic assumptions such as oil price and gas price with reference to broker and analyst data and publicly available peer company information.\n- o Evaluated possible changes to the APLNG discount rate with reference to external market data including government bond rates and comparable company data.\n- o Considered the impact of climate risk on the asset life and key macro-economic assumptions.\n- o Undertook sensitivity analysis for reasonably possible changes in key assumptions which included price sensitivity analysis using scenarios developed by the International Energy Agency.\n- \u00b7 Considered available market information including trading and reserve multiples as a cross check of the carrying value of the Group's equity accounted investment.\n- \u00b7 Assessed the climate related disclosures in respect of APLNG for accuracy and consistency with other publicly disclosed information.\n\nA member firm of Ernst & Young Global Limited Liability limited by a scheme approved under Professional Standards Legislation",

Key factors that require consideration impacting the complex estimation process include:\n\n- \u00b7 Estimation of customer demand and energy consumption, which is impacted by weather, an individual customer's circumstances and market volatility.\n- \u00b7 Application of different customer rates across different regulated and unregulated markets.\n\nThe Group's disclosures in respect of the unbilled revenue estimation process are included in Notes A2 and C1 of the financial report.\n\nOur audit procedures included the following:\n\n- \u00b7 Assessed whether the methodology used to recognise unbilled revenue met the requirements of Australian Accounting Standards.\n- \u00b7 Assessed the effectiveness of the Group's controls governing energy purchased, energy sold and the customer pricing process.\n- \u00b7 Evaluated the unbilled revenue calculation as follows:\n- o With the assistance of our data analytics specialists, assessed the calculation methodology of the unbilled revenue model.\n- o Compared inputs used in the calculation to supporting data such as historical temperature data, volume data provided by the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) and solar-feed-in data.\n- o Tested the reasonableness of the Group's allocation of energy consumed to residential and small and medium enterprises ('SME') with reference to historical billing data.\n- o Compared the prices applied to unbilled customer consumption with historical and current billing data.\n- o Reviewed the Group's reconciliation of volumes acquired from AEMO against volumes sold and volumes purchased as used by the Group in their analysis.\n- o Compared the historical accuracy of the unbilled revenue accrual by comparing the historical accrual to final billing data and performing a trend analysis of the accrual year on year.\n- o Tested the accuracy of the unbilled revenue accrual for business customers by comparing the unbilled revenue accrual to subsequent invoices.\n- Evaluated the adequacy of the related disclosures in the financial report including those made with respect to judgements and estimates\n\n\u00b7\n\n## Information Other than the Financial Report and A uditor's Report Thereon\n\nThe directors are responsible for the other information.

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the Australian Auditing Standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of this financial report.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with the Australian Auditing Standards, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n\n- \u25ba Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial report, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- \u25ba Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group ' s internal control.\n- \u25ba Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the directors.\n- \u25ba Conclude on the appropriateness of the directors ' use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group ' s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor ' s report to the related disclosures in the financial report or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor ' s",

Methodology regarding reserves and resources\n\nThe Reserves Report has been prepared to be consistent with the Petroleum Resources Management System (PRMS) 2018 published by the Society of Petroleum Engineers (SPE). This document may be downloaded from the SPE website: https://www.spe.org/en/industry/ reserves/. Additionally, this Reserves Report has been prepared to be consistent with the ASX reporting guidelines. For all assets, Origin reports reserves and resources consistent with SPE guidelines as follows: proved reserves (1P); proved plus probable reserves (2P); proved plus probable plus possible reserves (3P) and best estimate contingent resource (2C). Reserves must be discovered, recoverable, commercial and remaining.\n\nThe CSG reserves and resources held within APLNG's properties have either been independently prepared by NSAI or prepared by Origin. The reserves and resources estimates contained in this report have been prepared in accordance with the standards, definitions and guidelines contained within the PRMS and generally accepted petroleum engineering and evaluation principles as set out in the SPE Reserves Auditing Standards.\n\nOrigin does not intend to report prospective or undiscovered resources as defined by the SPE in any of its areas of interest on an ongoing basis.\n\n## b. Economic test for reserves\n\nThe assessment of reserves requires a commercial test to establish that reserves can be economically recovered. Within the commercial test, operating cost and capital cost estimates are combined with fiscal regimes and product pricing to confirm the economic viability of producing the reserves.\n\nGas reserves are assessed against existing contractual arrangements and local market conditions, as appropriate. In the case of gas reserves where contracts are not in place, a forward price scenario based on monetisation of the reserves through domestic markets has been used, including power generation opportunities, direct sales to LNG and other end users, and utilisation of Origin's wholesale and retail channels to market.\n\nFor CSG reserves that are intended to supply the APLNG CSG to LNG project, the economic test is based on a weighted average price across domestic, spot and LNG contracts, less short run marginal costs\n\n## e. Rounding\n\nInformation on reserves is quoted in this report rounded to the nearest whole number. Some totals in tables in this report may not add due to rounding. Items that round to zero are represented by the number 0, while items that are actually zero are represented with a dash \"-\".\n\n## f. Abbreviations\n\n| bbl     | barrel                            |\n|---------|-----------------------------------|\n| Tscf    | trillion standard cubic feet      |\n| CSG     | coal seam gas                     |\n| kbbls   | kilo barrels = 1,000 barrels      |\n| ktonnes | kilo tonnes = 1,000 tonnes        |\n| mmboe   | million barrels of oil equivalent |\n| PJ      | petajoule = 1 x 10 15  joules     |\n| PJe     | petajoule equivalent              |\n\n## g. Conversion factors for PJe\n\nCSG\n\n1.038 PJ/Bscf\n\n## h. Reference point\n\nReference points for Origin's petroleum reserves and contingent resources are defined points within Origin's operations where normal exploration and production business ceases, and quantities of the produced product are measured under defined conditions prior to custody transfer. Fuel, flare and vent consumed to the reference points are excluded.\n\n## i. Preparing and aggregating petroleum resources\n\nPetroleum reserves and contingent resources are typically prepared by deterministic methods with support from probabilistic methods. Petroleum reserves and contingent resources are aggregated by arithmetic summation by category and as a result, proved reserves may be a conservative estimate due to the portfolio effects of the arithmetic summation. Proved plus probable plus possible may be an optimistic estimate due to the same aforementioned reasons.\n\n## j. Methodology and internal controls\n\nThe reserves estimates undergo an assurance process to ensure that they are technically reasonable given the available data and have been prepared according to our reserves and resources process, which includes adherence to the PRMS Guidelines. The assurance process includes peer reviews of the technical and commercial assumptions. The annual reserves report is reviewed by management with the appropriate technical expertise, including Integrated Gas General Managers.\n\nfor downstream transport and processing. This price is exposed to changes in the supply/demand balance in the market through oil price-linked LNG contracts.\n\n## c. Reversionary rights\n\nThe CSG interests that APLNG acquired from Tri-Star in 2002 are subject to reversionary rights. If triggered, these rights will require APLNG to transfer back to Tri-Star a 45 per cent interest in those CSG interests for no additional consideration. Origin has assessed the potential impact of these reversionary rights, based on economic tests consistent with the reserves and resources referable to the CSG interests, and based on that assessment does not consider that the existence of these reversionary rights impacts the reserves and resources quoted in this report. Tri-Star has commenced proceedings against APLNG claiming that reversion has occurred. APLNG denies that reversion has occurred and is defending the claim. 1\n\n## d. Information regarding the preparation of this Reserves Report\n\nThe CSG reserves and resources held within APLNG's properties have either been independently prepared by NSAI or by Origin. All assessments are based on technical, commercial and operational data provided by Origin on behalf of APLNG.\n\nThe statements in this Report relating to reserves and resources as at 30 June 2023 for APLNG's interests in non-operated assets are based on information in the NSAI report dated 3 August 2023. The data has been compiled by Mr John Hattner, a fulltime employee of NSAI. Mr Hattner has consented to the statements based on this information, and to the form and context in which these statements appear.\n\nThe statements in this Report relating to reserves and resources for other assets are based on, and fairly represent, information and supporting documentation prepared by, or under the supervision of qualified petroleum reserves and resource evaluators who are employees of Origin.\n\nThis Reserves Statement as a whole has been approved by Mr Alistair Jones CPEng NER MIEAust who is a full-time employee of Origin. Mr Alistair Jones is Chief Reservoir Engineer, a qualified petroleum reserves and resources evaluator and a member of the Society of Petroleum Engineers, has consented to the form and context in which these statements appear.",

Statutory financial measures also include measures that have been directly calculated from, or disaggregated directly from financial information included in the Financial Statements for the Origin Consolidated Group.\n\n| Term                                     | Meaning                                                                                                                                                         |\n|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Cash flows from  investing activities    | Statutory cash flows from investing activities as  disclosed in the Statement of Cash Flows in the  Origin Consolidated Financial Statements.                   |\n| Cash flows from  operating activities    | Statutory cash flows from operating activities as  disclosed in the Statement of Cash Flows in the  Origin Consolidated Financial Statements.                   |\n| Cash flows used in  financing activities | Statutory cash flows used in financing activities as  disclosed in the Statement of Cash Flows in the  Origin Consolidated Financial Statements.                |\n| Net Debt                                 | Total current and non-current interest-bearing  liabilities only, less cash and cash equivalents  excluding cash to fund APLNG day-to- day operations.          |\n| Non- controlling interest                | Economic interest in a controlled entity of  the consolidated entity that is not held by  the Parent entity or a controlled entity of the  consolidated entity. |\n| Statutory  Profit/Loss                   | Net profit/loss after tax and non-controlling  interests as disclosed in the Income Statement  in the Origin Consolidated Financial Statements.                 |\n| Statutory earnings  per share            | Statutory Profit/Loss divided by weighted  average number of shares as disclosed in the  Income Statement in the Origin Consolidated  Financial Statements.     |\n\n## Non-IFRS financial measures\n\nNon-IFRS financial measures are defined as financial measures that are presented other than in accordance with all relevant Accounting Standards. Non-IFRS financial measures are used internally by management to assess the performance of Origin's business, and to make decisions on allocation of resources. The Non-IFRS financial measures have been derived from Statutory financial measures included in the Origin Consolidated Financial Statements, and are provided in this report, along with the Statutory financial measures to enable further insight and a different perspective into the financial performance, including profit and loss and cash flow outcomes, of the Origin business.\n\nThe principal Non-IFRS profit and loss measure of Underlying Profit has been reconciled to Statutory Profit in Section 5.1. The key NonIFRS financial measures included in this report are defined below.\n\n| Term                                           | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n|------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| AASB                                           | Australian Accounting Standards Board                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n| Adjusted  Net Debt                             | Net Debt adjusted to remove fair value adjustments  on hedged borrowings                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n| Adjusted  Underlying  EBITDA                   | Origin Underlying EBITDA - Share of APLNG  Underlying EBITDA and Octopus Energy EBITDA  + net cash from APLNG over the relevant 12  month period.                                                                                                                        |\n| Average  interest rate                         | Interest expense divided by Origin's average drawn  debt during the period.                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| cps                                            | Cents per share.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |\n| Free Cash Flow                                 | Net cash from operating and investing activities  (excluding major growth projects), less interest paid.                                                                                                                                                                 |\n| FY23  (Current period)                         | Twelve months ended 30 June 2023.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n| FY22  (Prior period)                           | Twelve months ended 30 June 2022.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n| Gearing                                        | Adjusted Net Debt / (Adjusted Net Debt +  Total equity)                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n| Gross Profit                                   | Revenue less cost of goods sold.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |\n| Items excluded  from Underlying  Profit (IEUP) | Items that do not align with the manner in which  the Chief Executive Officer reviews the financial and  operating performance of the business which are  excluded from Underlying Profit.
